Reports of beneficial treatment of murine leukemia by irradiation and injection of marrow cells from another mouse stimulated interest in attempting to use these techniques to treat patients with leukemia. The first few bold attempts at human application were generally met with a total lack of success except for a few transplants involving identical twins. Understanding the HLA system led to the ability to select compatible sibling donors. The first successful long-term survivors were reported at the end of the 1960s. During the 1970's patients were given transplants for leukemia after failure of all other treatment. Survivals were poor, but some patients were cured. Transplantation early in the course of the disease resulted in greatly improved survival. During the 1980s improved control of infections, the use of peripheral blood as the source of stem cells, and the ability to select donors other than family members resulted in wide application of hematopoietic cell grafting.","['Thomas, E D']",['Thomas ED'],"['Department of Medicine, University of Washington, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA 98109, USA.']",['eng'],"['Historical Article', 'Journal Article']",United States,World J Surg,World journal of surgery,7704052,IM,"['Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*history/methods', 'History, 20th Century', 'United States']",2000/06/01 00:00,2000/06/01 00:01,['2000/06/01 00:00'],"['2000/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2000/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '2000/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s002680010130 [pii]', '10.1007/s002680010130 [doi]']",ppublish,World J Surg. 2000 Jul;24(7):815-8. doi: 10.1007/s002680010130.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

STUDY DESIGN: In these last years, despite of routine application of anti-HCV testing, our blood transfusion center has been involved in 53 cases of alleged post-transfusion HCV hepatitis and look-back programs were set up with the goal of finding out the donors possibly involved in viral transmission. Most of these patients were hematological cases with multiple transfusions given because of aplastic anemia (3 cases), leukemia with or without bone marrow transplantation (5/4 cases) but necessitating long-term platelet support, leukemia and solid cancer patients undergoing autologous PBSC transplantation (3/4 cases) and TTP (2 cases). Only 32 patients were of the simple medical or surgical type, 9 transfused because of cardiac or vascular surgery, 8 because of spine surgery, 5 for different diseases and 5 for different types of cancer surgery. Donor's infectivity was determined by ELISA anti-HCV testing, by recombinant immunoblotting assay, and by nucleic acid testing. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: No donors out of 267 traced of a total of 359 involved was found with anti-HCV seroconversion, or positive on PCR testing. This suggests that the responsibility for HCV transmission can only hypothetically be related to blood or blood components and that other transmission routes should be found out.","['Ruzzenenti, M R', 'De Luigi, M C', 'Bruni, R', 'Giannini, G', 'Bo, A', 'Valbonesi, M', 'Barresi, R', 'Torretta, F', 'Gianotti, P', 'Bruzzone, B']","['Ruzzenenti MR', 'De Luigi MC', 'Bruni R', 'Giannini G', 'Bo A', 'Valbonesi M', 'Barresi R', 'Torretta F', 'Gianotti P', 'Bruzzone B']","['Immunohematology Services, San Martino University Hospital, Largo R.

A nested case-control study is being conducted to investigate this excess. This paper describes the methods used to provide quantitative estimates of benzene exposure for each of the subjects in the case-control study. Job histories were compiled for each subject from interviews and company employment records. Site visits and telephone interviews were used to identify the tasks included in each job title. Details about the tasks such as their frequency, the technology in use and about changes that had taken place over the years were also gathered. Exposure dated back to the late 1940s for a few subjects. Collaborating petroleum companies provided recent benzene exposure monitoring data. These were used to generate Base Estimates of exposure for each task, augmented with data from the literature where necessary. Past exposures were estimated from the Base Estimates by means of an exposure algorithm. The modifying effects of technological changes and changes to the product were used in the algorithm. The algorithm was then computed to give, for each job, for each subject, an estimate of average benzene exposure in ppm in the workplace atmosphere (Workplace Estimate). This value was multiplied by the years for which the job was held and these values summed to give an estimate of Cumulative Estimate of benzene in ppm-years. The occupational hygienists performing the exposure assessment did so without knowledge of the case or control status of subjects. Overall exposures to benzene in the Australian petroleum industry were low, and virtually all activities and jobs were below a time-weighted average of 5 ppm. Exposures in terminals were generally higher than at refineries. Exposures in upstream areas were extremely low. Estimates of Cumulative Estimate to benzene ranged from 0.005 to 50.9 ppm-years.","['Glass, D C', 'Adams, G G', 'Manuell, R W', 'Bisby, J A']","['Glass DC', 'Adams GG', 'Manuell RW', 'Bisby JA']","['Occupational Hygiene Unit, Faculty of Science and Technology, Deakin University, Victoria 3217, Geelong, Australia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",England,Ann Occup Hyg,The Annals of occupational hygiene,0203526,IM,"['Australia', 'Benzene/*analysis', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/prevention & control', 'Models, Theoretical', 'Occupational Exposure/*analysis', '*Petroleum', 'Retrospective Studies']",2000/06/01 09:00,2000/07/25 11:00,['2000/06/01 09:00'],"['2000/06/01 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/07/25 11:00 [medline]', '2000/06/01 09:00 [entrez]']",['S0003-4878(99)00105-2 [pii]'],ppublish,Ann Occup Hyg. 2000 Jun;44(4):301-20.,"['0 (Petroleum)', 'J64922108F (Benzene)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Crosslinking of MUC1 on peripheral blood T cells by plate-bound anti-MUC1 (DF3-P) antibody inhibits cell proliferation, IL-2 and GM-CSF production, and up-regulation of the IL-2 receptor upon anti-CD3 stimulation. Induction of IL-2 production by Jurkat and HUT 78 is also suppressed and cannot be reversed by the addition of anti-CD28 mAb.

Its favorable toxicity profile, and the more recent demonstration of anti-tumor activity in animals and humans, prompted us to investigate the role of the aldehyde groups in a structure-activity study in cultured tumor cells. Four racemic compounds were evaluated: gossypol 1a, gossypolone 2, the bis Schiff's base of L-phenylalanine methyl ester with gossypol (bis Schiff's base) 1c and apogossypol 1b. The former two compounds both retain the aldehyde functional groups at positions 8 and 8' of the molecule whilst in the latter two compounds the aldehydes are blocked or absent, respectively. In addition, the l- and d-isomers of gossypol 1a, the bis Schiff's base 1c and the half Schiff's base 1d (one aldehyde blocked) were tested. The cell lines studied included melanoma (SK-mel-19), cervix (Sihas), small cell lung (H69) and myelogenous leukemia (K562). Cytotoxicity was measured using the MTT and flow cytometric viability assays. Racemic gossypol 1a and gossypolone 2 induced similar dose-dependent decreases in cell viability in all the cell lines with IC50 values of 23-46 and 28-50 microM, respectively. In contrast, the racemic bis Schiff's base derivative of gossypol 1c and apogossypol 1b showed minimal activity in any cell line up to 50 microM. The l-enantiomer of gossypol 1a was significantly more active than the d-enantiomer (IC50 of 20 versus > 50 microM, respectively). When one aldehyde of either enantiomer was blocked 1d cytoxicity was comparable to the l-enantiomer of gossypol.

Southern blot analyses using a 3.2-kb fragment derived from the TTV DNA, however, showed no evidence supporting the fact that the TTV genomes are integrated into the human hematopoietic cell genomes, thus suggesting their existence as episomal forms.","['Tanaka, Y', 'Mizokami, M', 'Orito, E', 'Ohno, T', 'Nakano, T', 'Kato, T', 'Iida, S', 'Ueda, R']","['Tanaka Y', 'Mizokami M', 'Orito E', 'Ohno T', 'Nakano T', 'Kato T', 'Iida S', 'Ueda R']","['Second Department of Medicine, Nagoya City University Medical School, Mizuho, Nagoya, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,IM,"['Blotting, Southern', 'Bone Marrow/pathology/virology', 'Circoviridae/genetics/*isolation & purification', 'Circoviridae Infections/epidemiology/genetics/pathology/*virology', 'DNA, Circular/isolation & purification', 'DNA, Neoplasm/genetics', 'DNA, Single-Stranded/isolation & purification', 'DNA, Viral/*isolation & purification', '*Genome, Viral', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/genetics/*virology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*virology', 'Humans', 'Lymph Nodes/pathology/virology', 'Plasmids/*genetics', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Prevalence', '*Virus Integration']",2000/06/01 09:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2000/06/01 09:00'],"['2000/06/01 09:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2000/06/01 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.3109/10428190009087033 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2000 Jul;38(3-4):411-7. doi: 10.3109/10428190009087033.,"['0 (DNA, Circular)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (DNA, Single-Stranded)', '0 (DNA, Viral)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Structural alterations of the NF-kappaB/rel genes NFkappaB2, c-rel and bcl-3 have been shown to result in increased NF-kappaB/rel activity. Because we observed strong constitutive NF-kappaB/rel binding activity in chronic lymphocytic leukemia of the B-cell type (B-CLL) which may contribute to resistance against cytotoxic drugs we studied the genomic organisation of NFkappaB2, c-rel and bcl-3 gene loci in a panel of lymphoproliferative disorders (n=81) with an emphasis on B-CLL (n=47). The method of genomic Southern blotting using cDNAs of the respective genes was used. In spite of the role of NF-kappaB/rel in myeloid maturation there is no data available as to the occurrence of NF-kappaB/rel rearrangements in chronic myeloproliferative syndromes (cMPS). For this reason we included a small panel of cMPS patients (n=16). Southern Blotting revealed a germline configuration of NFkappaB2, c-rel and bcl-3 loci in all NHL and cMPS patients examined. Our results demonstrate that structural alterations of NFkappaB2, c-rel and bcl-3 genes at the Southern Blotting level are rare events that do not contribute to lymphoid or myeloid transformation in the majority of NHL or cMPS patients.","['Munzert, G', 'Kreitmeier, S', 'Bergmann, L']","['Munzert G', 'Kreitmeier S', 'Bergmann L']","['Abteilung Innere Medizin III, Universitat Ulm, Germany. gerd.munzert@medizin.uni-ulm.de']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,IM,"['B-Cell Lymphoma 3 Protein', 'Blotting, Southern', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 14/genetics/ultrastructure', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 19/genetics/ultrastructure', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', 'DNA, Neoplasm/*genetics', 'Genes', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, B-Cell/genetics', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/genetics', 'Lymphoproliferative Disorders/*genetics', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/*genetics', 'NF-kappa B/*genetics', 'NF-kappa B p52 Subunit', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-rel/*genetics', 'Transcription Factors', 'Translocation, Genetic']",2000/06/01 09:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2000/06/01 09:00'],"['2000/06/01 09:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2000/06/01 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.3109/10428190009087031 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2000 Jul;38(3-4):395-400. doi: 10.3109/10428190009087031.,"['0 (B-Cell Lymphoma 3 Protein)', '0 (BCL3 protein, human)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (NF-kappa B p52 Subunit)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-rel)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Most if not all gammadelta PTCL are extranodal lymphomas and among them, hepatosplenic gammadelta PTCL constitute a distinct clinicopathological entity. Besides alphabeta and gammadelta PTCL, there is a recently recognized group of extranodal, mainly nasal tumours, which display, in most instances, phenotypic and genotypic features of Natural-Killer cell non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (NK-NHL). Cytotoxic cells, including NK cells and cytotoxic alphabeta and gammadelta T lymphocytes may induce lysis of the target by using granule-associated cytotoxic proteins such as the T-cell intracellular antigen-1 (TIA-1), perforin and granzyme B. Expression of TIA-1 can be detected in all cytotoxic cells whereas granzyme B and perforin expression can be detected in high levels only in activated cytotoxic cells. Recently, several studies showed that the expression of these cytotoxic proteins in tumour cells of PTCL and NK-NHL is associated with a) extranodal site of clinicopathological presentation b) NK or Tgammadelta-cell phenotype c) CD30 expression in cutaneous T-cell lymphoproliferations and d) anaplastic morphology in nodal PTCL. This latter finding contrasts with the data that only rare Hodgkin lymphomas (HL) express cytotoxic proteins in Hodgkin and Reed-Sternberg cells. Altogether the data of the literature indicate that most extranodal T and NK-NHL are activated cytotoxic lymphomas with the notable exception of hepatosplenic gammadelta PTCL which represent tumours of non-activated cytotoxic cells. On this basis, it is suggested that the expression of cytotoxic proteins may be useful for the identification and classification of extranodal T and NK-cell lymphomas and, to some extent, for the differential diagnosis between HL and CD30+ anaplastic large cell lymphomas. Cytotoxic lymphomas are preferentially localized in extranodal sites such as skin, lung, upper respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts, which are continuously exposed to various antigens. Since cytotoxic T and NK cells are regarded as first line of defense in these sites, and some cytotoxic tumours such as nasal lymphomas and enteropathy-type intestinal lymphomas are associated with EBV and gliadin, respectively, it is likely that chronic antigen exposure may play a role in the pathogenesis of cytotoxic lymphomas occurring in mucosa and/or skin. Besides chronic antigenic stimulation, chronic immunosuppression may also have pathogenetic significance in cytotoxic lymphomas in view of their increased incidence in immunocompromised patients.","['Kanavaros, P', 'Boulland, M L', 'Petit, B', 'Arnulf, B', 'Gaulard, P']","['Kanavaros P', 'Boulland ML', 'Petit B', 'Arnulf B', 'Gaulard P']","['Department of Pathology, Henri Mondor Hospital AP-HP, Creteil, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,IM,"['Antigens, CD/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Biomarkers, Tumor', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Epstein-Barr Virus Infections/pathology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Granzymes', 'Hodgkin Disease/diagnosis/metabolism/pathology', 'Humans', 'Ki-1 Antigen/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*pathology', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/diagnosis/genetics/*metabolism/pathology/virology', 'Lymphoma, Large-Cell, Anaplastic/diagnosis/genetics/*metabolism/pathology/virology', 'Lymphoma, T-Cell, Peripheral/diagnosis/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Membrane Proteins/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Perforin', 'Phenotype', 'Poly(A)-Binding Proteins', 'Pore Forming Cytotoxic Proteins', '*Proteins', 'RNA-Binding Proteins/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, alpha-beta/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, gamma-delta/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Serine Endopeptidases/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'T-Cell Intracellular Antigen-1', 'Tumor Virus Infections/pathology']",2000/06/01 09:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2000/06/01 09:00'],"['2000/06/01 09:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2000/06/01 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.3109/10428190009087022 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2000 Jul;38(3-4):317-26. doi: 10.3109/10428190009087022.,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Ki-1 Antigen)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Poly(A)-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Pore Forming Cytotoxic Proteins)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (RNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, alpha-beta)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, gamma-delta)', '0 (T-Cell Intracellular Antigen-1)', '0 (TIA1 protein, human)', '126465-35-8 (Perforin)', 'EC 3.4.21.- (GZMB protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.21.- (Granzymes)', 'EC 3.4.21.- (Serine Endopeptidases)']",66,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The method relies on quantitatively aberrant, leukemia-associated antigen expression patterns which allow to discriminate leukemic from normal BCP using a limited panel of antibody combinations and multidimensional flow cytometry. In an analysis of 63 follow up bone marrow samples of patients with BCP-ALL we show that this approach enables to efficiently detect MRD. Further clinical observation revealed that the patients which were MRD-positive by flow cytometry (although in morphological remission) had a very high probability of early disease recurrence compared to the good chances of a relapse-free survival (RFS) in the MRD-negative cohort (RFS 0.0 vs. 0.76 at 3 years). Comparative Phenotype Mapping thus proves to be a reliable method for MRD detection in BCP-ALL. Concluding remarks relate to the optional applications of the method as well as to future perspectives. An ongoing large prospective study which we are now conducting on the basis of Comparative Phenotype Mapping will clarify the clinical significance of MRD detection in ALL patients by this method, and will determine its value compared to related as well as molecular-genetic techniques.","['Dworzak, M N', 'Fritsch, G', 'Panzer-Grumayer, E R', 'Mann, G', 'Gadner, H']","['Dworzak MN', 'Fritsch G', 'Panzer-Grumayer ER', 'Mann G', 'Gadner H']","[""Children's Cancer Research Institute, St. Anna Kinderspital, Vienna, Austria.

Intravenous infusion of 10 mg As2O3 daily for one to two months can induce significant complete remission (CR) of APL, and there is no cross drug-resistance between As2O3 and other antileukemic agents, including all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA). The CR rate of relapsed and/or refractory APL patients who received As2O3 treatment ranged from 52.3% to 93.3%. The median duration to CR ranged from 38 to 51 days, with accumulative As2O3 dosage of 340-430 mg. Although most adverse reactions of As2O3 treatment were tolerable, certain infrequent but severe toxicities related to As2O3 were observed, including renal failure, hepatic damage, cardiac arrhythmia and chronic neuromuscular degeneration, which should be monitored carefully. As2O3 can induce partial differentiation and subsequent apoptosis of APL cells through degradation of wild type PML and PML/RAR alpha chimeric proteins and possible anti-mitochondrial effects. Like the treatment of ATRA in APL, early relapses from As2O3 treatment within a few months were not infrequently seen, indicating that rapid emerging resistance to As2O3 can occur. Nevertheless, the PML/RAR alpha fusion protein was reported to disappear in some APL patients who received As2O3, and who might earn long-survival. However, the follow-up is still too short to draw the conclusion. Intriguingly, it has been shown that As2O3 can also induce apoptosis of other non-APL tumor cells with clinical achievable concentrations. However, the detailed molecular mechanisms are not yet fully understood. Further studies regarding to the pharmacological characters, clinical efficacies, toxicities, apoptogenic mechanisms, and spectrum of anti-tumor activity of As2O3 are warranted.","['Huan, S Y', 'Yang, C H', 'Chen, Y C']","['Huan SY', 'Yang CH', 'Chen YC']","['Department of Internal Medicine, National Taiwan University Hospital, Taipei.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,IM,"['Acute Kidney Injury/chemically induced', 'Antineoplastic Agents/adverse effects/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Arrhythmias, Cardiac/chemically induced', 'Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals/adverse effects/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Chemical and Drug Induced Liver Injury/etiology', 'Drug Evaluation', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Gastrointestinal Neoplasms/drug therapy/pathology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*drug therapy/mortality/pathology', 'Life Tables', 'Medicine, Chinese Traditional', 'Mitochondria/drug effects', 'Models, Biological', 'Neoplasm Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/drug effects', 'Neuromuscular Diseases/chemically induced', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Oxides/adverse effects/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Remission Induction', '*Salvage Therapy', 'Survival Analysis', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects', 'Urinary Bladder Neoplasms/drug therapy/pathology']",2000/06/01 09:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2000/06/01 09:00'],"['2000/06/01 09:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2000/06/01 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.3109/10428190009087019 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2000 Jul;38(3-4):283-93. doi: 10.3109/10428190009087019.,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Oxides)', '0 (promyelocytic leukemia-retinoic acid receptor alpha fusion oncoprotein)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)']",72,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The extent of the growth inhibitory response to TGFbeta varies with cell type, and is not linked to stages of differentiation of cell lines. Downregulation of multiple cell cycle-regulatory molecules is a dominant event in TGFbeta1-mediated growth inhibition of human MV4-11 myeloid leukemia cells. Both G1-phase and G2-phase cyclins and cdks participate in the regulation of TGFbeta1-mediated growth inhibition of MV4-11 cells. By both depressing cdk2 synthesis and up-regulating cyclin E-associated p27, TGFbeta1 may magnify its inhibitory efficiency. TGFbeta1 also rapidly inhibits phosphorylation of pRb at several serine and threonine residues. The underphosphorylated pRb associates with E2F-4 in G1 phase, whereas the phosphorylated pRb mainly binds to E2F-1 and E2F-3 in proliferating MV4-11 cells. Since TGFbeta1 upregulates p130/E2F-4 complex formation and downregulates p107/E2F-4 complex formation, with E2F-4 levels remaining constant, our results suggest that E2F-4 is switched from p107 to pRb and p130 when cells exit from the cell cycle and arrest in G1 by TGFbeta1.

T lymphocytes contained in the allograft mediate a graft-versus-leukemia (GVL) effect and prevent graft rejection; however, T cells also initiate graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). Identification of T cell populations which mediate a GVL effect and prevent rejection with reduced GVHD will likely improve transplantation outcome. T cells exist in four functionally-defined populations, the CD4+, Th1/Th2 and CD8+, Tc1/Tc2 subsets. Th1-type CD4 cells primarily secrete type I cytokines (IL-2 and IFN-gamma), whereas Th2 cells secrete type II cytokines (IL-4, IL-5, and IL-10). Similarly, the CD8+ Tc1 and Tc2 cells differentially secrete the type I and type II cytokines, respectively. In addition to cytokine secretion, Tc1 and Tc2 populations mediate cytolytic effects, with Tc1 cells utilizing both perforin- and fas-based killing pathways, whereas Tc2 cells primarily utilize perforin-mediated cytolysis. In murine transplantation models of graft rejection, GVHD, and GVL effects, we have evaluated such functional T cell subsets for their ability to differentially mediate and regulate transplantation responses. These studies demonstrate that donor Th2 cells do not initiate acute GVHD, and can regulate the GVHD mediated by unmanipulated donor T cells without impairing alloengraftment. Additional experiments have shown that allospecific donor Tc2 cells result in reduced GVHD, and mediate a significant GVL effect. Thirdly, we have demonstrated that non-host reactive Tc2 cells with veto-like activity can potently abrogate marrow rejection independent of GVHD. Together, these results demonstrate that functionally-defined donor Th2 and Tc2 populations play an important role in the regulation of GVHD, the prevention of graft rejection, and the mediation of GVL effects, and suggest that utilization of Th2 and Tc2 cells in clinical allogeneic SCT may have potential for improving treatment outcome.","['Fowler, D H', 'Gress, R E']","['Fowler DH', 'Gress RE']","['National Cancer Institute, Department of Experimental Transplantation and Immunology, Bethesda, MD, USA. dhfowler@helix.nih.gov']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,IM,"['Animals', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Graft Enhancement, Immunologic', 'Graft Rejection/*immunology', 'Graft Survival/immunology', 'Graft vs Host Disease/*immunology', 'Graft vs Leukemia Effect/*immunology', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/adverse effects', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy, Adoptive', 'Leukemia/immunology/*therapy', 'Leukemia, Experimental/immunology', 'Lymphokines/metabolism', 'Lymphoma/immunology/*therapy', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/physiology', 'Mice', 'Models, Immunological', 'Neoplasm Transplantation/immunology', 'Perforin', 'Pore Forming Cytotoxic Proteins', 'T-Lymphocyte Subsets/*immunology/metabolism', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/*immunology/metabolism', 'Th2 Cells/*immunology/metabolism/transplantation', 'Transplantation, Homologous/*immunology', 'Treatment Outcome']",2000/06/01 09:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2000/06/01 09:00'],"['2000/06/01 09:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2000/06/01 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.3109/10428190009087014 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2000 Jul;38(3-4):221-34. doi: 10.3109/10428190009087014.,"['0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Pore Forming Cytotoxic Proteins)', '126465-35-8 (Perforin)']",84,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) there is a perturbation of these controlling elements, resulting in overgrowth of leukemic cells in the bone marrow and spleen. In part, the proliferation of CML CD34+ cells may result from an abnormal response to the cytokine Stem Cell Factor (SCF). SCF induced proliferation and adhesion to the extracellular matrix via fibronectin are not coupled in CML as they are in normal cells and this may contribute to the accumulation of leukemic progenitors. We have previously shown that CD34+ CML cells and the more primitive CD34+ CD38- CML cells do not require the addition of synergistic cytokines to cultures, but are capable of proliferation in SCF alone, and that leukemic CFU-GM are selectively supported in these cultures. In the presence of other cytokines the response of CML cells to SCF is no greater than that of cells from normal donors, suggesting that the leukemic cells are not more sensitive to SCF, but that accessory pathways are already activated in these cells. Cells from patients with myeloproliferative disorders show variable proliferative response to SCF as the sole mitogenic stimulus, suggesting that expression of bcr-abl is essential for proliferation in this cytokine. Further studies to identify the key determinants of the abnormal response to SCF in CML may lead to a better understanding of the proliferative abnormality that underlies CML.","['Moore, S', 'McDiarmid, L A', 'Hughes, T P']","['Moore S', 'McDiarmid LA', 'Hughes TP']","['Division of Haematology, Hanson Centre for Cancer Research, IMVS, Adelaide, Australia. sarah.moore@imvs.sa.gov.au']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,IM,"['Apoptosis', 'Autocrine Communication', 'Cell Adhesion/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Extracellular Matrix/metabolism', 'Fibronectins/metabolism', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/physiology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*drug effects/pathology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*pathology', 'Ligands', 'Neoplasm Proteins/drug effects/genetics/physiology', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*drug effects/pathology', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Processing, Post-Translational/genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit/drug effects/genetics/physiology', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/physiology', 'Stem Cell Factor/*pharmacology', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects/metabolism/pathology']",2000/06/01 09:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2000/06/01 09:00'],"['2000/06/01 09:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2000/06/01 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.3109/10428190009087013 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2000 Jul;38(3-4):211-20. doi: 10.3109/10428190009087013.,"['0 (Fibronectins)', '0 (Ligands)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Stem Cell Factor)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",60,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A hammerhead ribozyme (Rz) targeted to the first GUC site within the 12-LOX mRNA was designed and cloned into an in vitro transcriptional or mammalian expression vector. In vitro, the Rz was able to cleave its substrate efficiently in a time-dependent manner. Under multiple turnover conditions, the Rz performed well at 37 degrees C, with a further improvement at 50 degrees C. When cloned into a mammalian expression vector, pSV2neo, the Rz construct efficiently decreased the level of 12-LOX mRNA in stably transfected human erythroleukemia cells to levels that were undetectable by Northern blot analyses. 12-LOX enzyme activity assays showed that Rz significantly reduced the 12-hydroperoxy-5,8,10,14-eicosatetraenoic acid production in human erythroleukemia cells; this effect was sustained for up to 6 months in cell culture.

In this study, we investigated the effect of TGF-beta1 on inorganic phosphate (Pi) transport and on expression of the type III Pi carriers Glvr-1 and Ram-1 in murine ATDC5 chondrocytes. TGF-beta1 induced a selective, dose- and time-dependent increase in sodium-dependent Pi transport in ATDC5 cells. This response was dependent on RNA and protein synthesis and reflected a change in the maximal rate of the transport system, suggesting that TGF-beta1 induces the synthesis of new Pi carriers and their insertion into the plasma membrane. Consistently, Northern blotting analysis showed a dose-dependent increase in Glvr-1 messenger RNA expression in response to TGF-beta1, which preceded the maximal stimulation of Pi transport by several hours. Glvr-1 thus likely mediates at least part of the increase in Pi uptake induced by TGF-beta1. Ram-1 messenger RNA expression was not affected by TGF-beta1. TGF-beta1 activated the Smad signaling pathway and the mitogen-activated protein kinases ERK and p38 in ATDC5 cells. Unlike the regulation of Pi transport by receptor tyrosine kinase agonists in osteoblasts, the effect of TGF-beta1 on Pi uptake in ATDC5 cells did not involve protein kinase C or mitogen-activated protein kinases, suggesting that a specific, possibly Smad-dependent, signal mediates this response. In conclusion, TGF-beta1 stimulates Pi transport and Glvr-1 expression in chondrocytes, suggesting that, like proliferation, differentiation, and matrix synthesis, Pi handling is subject to regulation by TGF-beta3 family members in bone-forming cells.","['Palmer, G', 'Guicheux, J', 'Bonjour, J P', 'Caverzasio, J']","['Palmer G', 'Guicheux J', 'Bonjour JP', 'Caverzasio J']","['Department of Internal Medicine, University Hospital, Geneva, Switzerland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Endocrinology,Endocrinology,0375040,IM,"['Animals', 'Biological Transport/drug effects', 'Blotting, Northern', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Membrane/metabolism', 'Chondrocytes/*metabolism', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Gene Expression/*drug effects', 'MAP Kinase Signaling System', 'Mice', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 3', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/metabolism', 'Phosphates/*metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors', 'Receptors, Virus/*genetics/metabolism', 'Transforming Growth Factor beta/*pharmacology', 'p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases']",2000/06/01 09:00,2000/06/17 09:00,['2000/06/01 09:00'],"['2000/06/01 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/06/17 09:00 [medline]', '2000/06/01 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1210/endo.141.6.7495 [doi]'],ppublish,Endocrinology. 2000 Jun;141(6):2236-43. doi: 10.1210/endo.141.6.7495.,"['0 (Phosphates)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Receptors, Virus)', '0 (Transforming Growth Factor beta)', '0 (leukemia virus receptor, gibbon ape)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 3)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Translocated ETS leukemia (TEL) is frequently involved in chromosomal translocations in human malignancies, usually resulting in the expression of fusion proteins between the amino-terminal part of TEL and either unrelated transcription factors or protein tyrosine kinases. We have characterized a t(1;12)(q21;p13) translocation in an acute myeloblastic leukemia (AML-M2). At the protein level, the untranslocated TEL copy and, as a result of the t(1;12) translocation, a fusion protein between TEL and essentially all of aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator (ARNT) are expressed. The involvement of ARNT in human leukemogenesis has not been previously described. The ARNT protein belongs to a subfamily of the ""basic region helix-loop-helix"" (bHLH) protein that shares an additional region of similarity called the PAS (Per, ARNT, SIM) domain. ARNT is the central partner of several heterodimeric transcription factors, including those containing the aryl hydrocarbon (dioxin) receptor (AhR) and the hypoxia-inducible factor 1alpha (HIF1alpha). Our results show that the TEL-ARNT fusion protein is the crucial product of the translocation and suggest that interference with the activity of AhR or HIF1alpha can contribute to leukemogenesis.","['Salomon-Nguyen, F', 'Della-Valle, V', 'Mauchauffe, M', 'Busson-Le Coniat, M', 'Ghysdael, J', 'Berger, R', 'Bernard, O A']","['Salomon-Nguyen F', 'Della-Valle V', 'Mauchauffe M', 'Busson-Le Coniat M', 'Ghysdael J', 'Berger R', 'Bernard OA']","[""U434 Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale-Centre d'Etude du Polymorphisme Humain-Fondation Jean Dausset, 27 rue Juliette Dodu, 75010, Paris, France.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,IM,"['Artificial Gene Fusion', 'Aryl Hydrocarbon Receptor Nuclear Translocator', 'Child, Preschool', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 1', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 12', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics', 'Male', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-ets', '*Receptors, Aryl Hydrocarbon', '*Repressor Proteins', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics', '*Translocation, Genetic']",2000/06/01 09:00,2000/07/15 11:00,['2000/06/01 09:00'],"['2000/06/01 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/07/15 11:00 [medline]', '2000/06/01 09:00 [entrez]']","['10.1073/pnas.120162297 [doi]', '120162297 [pii]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2000 Jun 6;97(12):6757-62. doi: 10.1073/pnas.120162297.,"['0 (ARNT protein, human)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (ETS translocation variant 6 protein)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-ets)', '0 (Receptors, Aryl Hydrocarbon)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '138391-32-9 (Aryl Hydrocarbon Receptor Nuclear Translocator)']",,PMC18730,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Filgrastim has also been observed to effectively treat leukemic relapse after alloSCT. A retrospective analysis was performed to determine the effectiveness of filgrastim in treating relapses after alloSCT. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Fourteen patients with hematologic malignancies were treated with filgrastim at relapse after alloSCT. Filgrastim was given at 5 mcg/kg/d subcutaneously for 21 consecutive days. Response was evaluated at 7 days after completion of filgrastim. Immunosuppressants, if present, were rapidly tapered to complete discontinuation at the time of relapse. RESULTS: Three patients were not assessable for response because additional therapy was necessary before completion of filgrastim. Six patients (43%) achieved a complete response on an intent-to-treat basis. When response was evaluated based on relapse type, three of four cytogenetic relapses, two of three morphologic relapses, and one of four hematologic relapses achieved a complete remission. Two responses were observed in patients who were completely off of any immunosuppression at the time of relapse. Six patients developed chronic graft-versus-host disease. The event-free and overall survival rates for all 14 patients are 43% and 73%, respectively. CONCLUSION: The use of filgrastim with rapid discontinuation of immunosuppression results in response rates that are similar to results using DLI. Filgrastim could be considered as an alternative or an adjunct to DLI for relapses after alloSCT.","['Bishop, M R', 'Tarantolo, S R', 'Pavletic, Z S', 'Lynch, J C', 'Morris, M E', 'Zacharias, D', 'Armitage, J O', 'Kessinger, A']","['Bishop MR', 'Tarantolo SR', 'Pavletic ZS', 'Lynch JC', 'Morris ME', 'Zacharias D', 'Armitage JO', 'Kessinger A']","['Department of Internal Medicine, University of Nebraska Medical Center, Omaha, NE. mbishop@mail.NIH.gov']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,IM,"['Adult', 'Cytogenetic Analysis', 'Female', 'Filgrastim', 'Genetic Markers', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/*therapeutic use', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/genetics/*therapy', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/*therapy', '*Leukocyte Transfusion', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/genetics/*therapy', 'Recombinant Proteins', 'Recurrence', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Rate', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Treatment Outcome']",2000/06/01 09:00,2000/07/08 11:00,['2000/06/01 09:00'],"['2000/06/01 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/07/08 11:00 [medline]', '2000/06/01 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1200/JCO.2000.18.11.2269 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2000 Jun;18(11):2269-72. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2000.18.11.2269.,"['0 (Genetic Markers)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', 'PVI5M0M1GW (Filgrastim)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this report it is shown that cdc25A protein is degraded by the ubiquitin-proteasome machinery in both terminally differentiating and cycling cells. Cdc25A was found to have two major peaks of accumulation during cell cycle progression, one in G1 and the other in S/G2. Evidence was obtained that degradation of cdc25A by the ubiquitin-proteasome machinery in terminally differentiating myeloid cells is accelerated compared to cycling cells.

OBJECTIVE: In this study, we intend to clarify the clinicopathological features of cutaneous CD4+ and CD56+ lymphoma. METHODS: Four patients with cutaneous CD4+ and CD56+ lymphoma were studied. RESULTS: Age at the first examination ranged from 71 to 89 years (mean = 81.2 years). One patient was female and 3 were males. The organ mainly involved at presentation was the skin. Lymphadenopathy, splenomegaly, leukemic spread and central nervous system involvement were observed as the disease progressed. The mean survival time was 12.2 months.

The heterogeneity of the disease results probably from the interaction of multiple gene abnormalities with environmental factors. The new approaches to drug design have become refocused to the emerging understanding of the role of signaling pathways in health and disease. Protein tyrosine kinases (PTKs) regulate cell proliferation, differentiation and immune processes. Uncontrolled signaling from receptor and intracellular tyrosine kinases can lead to numerous proliferative diseases: cancer, leukemia, restenosis and psoriasis. Identification of PTKs that play a key role in a defined disease can lead to a selective drug. The balance of signals which regulate the homeostasis of normal epidermis is altered in psoriasis. Several lines of evidence suggest a role for the EGF receptor system in this process. Therefore, blockers of the EGFR kinase were suggested as potent antipsoriasis agents. PTK inhibitors from the tyrphostin family were found to block EGF - dependent cell proliferation. AG 1571 (SU 5271) potently inhibits ligand-induced autophosphorylation of EGF-R, downstream signal transduction events, DNA replication and cell cycle progression at micromolar concentrations, as well as proliferation of keratinocytes isolated from psoriatic lesions in excellent correlation with its EGFR kinase inhibitory activity in these cells. AG 1571 (SU 5271) has been in clinical trials by SUGEN Inc. since early 1997. Overexpression of the EGFR is the hallmark of most epithelial cancers. Therefore one can view blockers of the EGFR kinase as becoming universal inhibitors. Tyrphostins are the first signal transduction agents to be used in the clinic.

These analogues appeared to be effective in induction of cell differentiation, inhibition of tumour cell proliferation in vitro and in increasing of antitumour effect of cytostatics. On the other hand, inhibition of cytostatic-induced apoptosis by these compounds was observed. The mechanism of the antiproliferative effect of calcitriol analogues in vitro is discussed. The induction of antigens CD14 and CD11b expression and phagocytic activity of HL-60 cells after exposure to these compounds is related to their effect on cell differentiation. The differentiation of the HL-60 leukaemia cells induced by side-chain modified analogues of calcitriol increases their sensitivity to the antiproliferative effect of cisplatin, doxorubicin and genistein, despite of that this pretreatment causes resistance of these cells to cytostatics-induced apoptosis. We observed a synergistic antiproliferative effect of the combined therapy using analogues of calcitriol with subsequent treatment with the above-mentioned cytostatics. This effect was measured as a significant decrease of the ID50 values for each cytostatic applied after pretreatment of the tumour cells with the calcitriol analogues. The results presented suggest that the improved therapeutic effect may be achieved also in vivo by the combined application of the analogues (without calcemic activity) of calcitriol with antitumour agents.","['Opolski, A', 'Wietrzyk, J', 'Siwinska, A', 'Marcinkowska, E', 'Chrobak, A', 'Radzikowski, C', 'Kutner, A']","['Opolski A', 'Wietrzyk J', 'Siwinska A', 'Marcinkowska E', 'Chrobak A', 'Radzikowski C', 'Kutner A']","['Ludwik Hirszfeld Institute of Immunology and Experimental Therapy, Polish Academy of Sciences, 12, Rudolf Weigl St., Wroclaw, 53-114, Poland. opolski@immuno.iitd.pan.wroc.pl']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United Arab Emirates,Curr Pharm Des,Current pharmaceutical design,9602487,IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Calcitriol/*analogs & derivatives', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Structure-Activity Relationship']",2000/06/01 09:00,2000/08/06 11:00,['2000/06/01 09:00'],"['2000/06/01 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/08/06 11:00 [medline]', '2000/06/01 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.2174/1381612003400407 [doi]'],ppublish,Curr Pharm Des. 2000 May;6(7):755-65. doi: 10.2174/1381612003400407.,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', 'FXC9231JVH (Calcitriol)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Determining benzene's skin-exposure dose and subsequent absorption is difficult because it has a low boiling point and exists as both liquid and vapor. Industrial and environmental benzene is present as a contaminant in other vehicles/solvents, and its percutaneous absorption is in part dependent upon co-solvent volatility. Co-solvents such as benzene in toluene rapidly evaporate from skin, whereas benzene contaminant in water is retained on skin longer due to water's lower volatility. Co-solvents can also affect benzene-skin partition coefficients; thus, permeability coefficients and percentage doses absorbed can vary many-fold.

The deduced polypeptide sequence of 289 amino acids has 3 contiguous zinc fingers at the near carboxyl-terminal end, an amino-terminal domain characterized by its high content of alanine and proline residues and a carboxyl-terminal domain rich in serine residues. By Northern blot hybridization, the human homologue of FKLF-2 is expressed in the bone marrow and striated muscles and not in 12 other human tissues analyzed. FKLF-2 is constitutively expressed in established cell lines with an erythroid phenotype, but it is inconsistently expressed in cell lines with myeloid or lymphoid phenotypes. The expression of FKLF-2 messenger RNA (mRNA) is up-regulated after induction of mouse erythroleukemia cells. In luciferase assays, FKLF-2 activates predominantly the gamma, and to a lesser degree, the epsilon and beta globin gene promoters. The activation of gamma gene promoter does not depend on the presence of an HS2 enhancer. FKLF-2 activates the gamma promoter predominantly by interacting with the gamma CACCC box, and to a lesser degree through interaction with the TATA box or its surrounding DNA sequences. FKLF-2 also activated all the other erythroid specific promoters we tested (GATA-1, glycophorin B, ferrochelatase, porphobilinogen deaminase, and 5-aminolevulinate synthase).

However, somatic mutation also occurs at another distinct locus, the 5' noncoding region of the bcl-6 gene, in both B-cell tumors and in normal germinal center B cells. To probe the suggestive link between the occurrence of mutations in V(H) and bcl-6 genes, we analyzed the nature of somatic mutation at these distinct loci in the 2 CLL subsets. Unexpectedly, we found no such link in the CLLs defined by unmutated V(H) genes, with 4 of 10 cases clearly showing mutations in bcl-6. In those CLLs defined by somatically mutated V(H) genes, 4 of 9 cases predictively showed bcl-6 mutations.

These AML patients are known to have a relatively favorable prognosis, which suggests that MRP1 might play an important role in determining clinical outcome. This study analyzed MRP1 deletion by fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH), with a focus on inv(16) AML patients. Functional activity of multidrug resistance protein (MRP) was studied in a flow cytometric assay with the use of the MRP substrate carboxyfluorescein (CF) and the inhibitor MK-571. MRP1, MRP2, and MRP6 messenger RNA (mRNA) expression was determined with reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The results were compared with normal bone marrow cells. MRP1 deletion was detected in 7 AML patients; 2 cases showed no MRP1 FISH signals, and 5 cases had 1 MRP1 signal, whereas in 4 AML patients with inv(16) no MRP1 deletions were observed. A variability in MRP activity, expressed as CF efflux-blocking by MK-571, was observed (efflux-blocking factors varied between 1.2 and 3.6); this correlated with the number of MRP1 genes (r = 0.91, P <. 01). MRP activity in the AML cases was not different from normal hematopoietic cells. MRP1 mRNA was detected in patients with 1 or 2 MRP1 FISH signals, but not in patients with no MRP1 signals. MRP2 and MRP6 mRNA were expressed predominantly in AML samples with 1 MRP1 signal, whereas in normal bone marrow cells no MRP2 and MRP6 mRNA was observed. In conclusion, this study shows that MRP activity varies among inv(16) AML cases and does not differ from that in normal hematopoietic cells; this might be in part due to the up-regulation of other MRP genes.","['van Der Kolk, D M', 'Vellenga, E', 'van Der Veen, A Y', 'Noordhoek, L', 'Timmer-Bosscha, H', 'Ossenkoppele, G J', 'Raymakers, R A', 'Muller, M', 'van Den Berg, E', 'de Vries, E G']","['van Der Kolk DM', 'Vellenga E', 'van Der Veen AY', 'Noordhoek L', 'Timmer-Bosscha H', 'Ossenkoppele GJ', 'Raymakers RA', 'Muller M', 'van Den Berg E', 'de Vries EG']","['Divisions of Hematology, Medical Oncology, and Gastroenterology and Hepatology, University Hospital of Groningen, Department of Medical Genetics, University of Groningen, Groningen, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Base Pair Mismatch', 'Bone Marrow Cells/cytology/pathology', 'Carcinoma, Small Cell', 'Cells, Cultured', '*Chromosome Inversion', 'Chromosome Mapping', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 16', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Doxorubicin/toxicity', 'Drug Resistance, Multiple/*genetics', '*Gene Deletion', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/drug therapy/*genetics/pathology', 'Lung Neoplasms', '*Multidrug Resistance-Associated Proteins', 'MutS Homolog 3 Protein', 'Reference Values', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2000/05/29 09:00,2000/07/06 11:00,['2000/05/29 09:00'],"['2000/05/29 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/07/06 11:00 [medline]', '2000/05/29 09:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)64019-8 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 2000 Jun 1;95(11):3514-9.,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (MSH3 protein, human)', '0 (Multidrug Resistance-Associated Proteins)', '0 (MutS Homolog 3 Protein)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', 'Y49M64GZ4Q (multidrug resistance-associated protein 1)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A distant family member, Smad7, is expressed in most mammalian tissues and cells and prevents TGF-beta signaling. In this study, we examined the physiologic role of Smad7 in mediating the effects of activin, a member of the TGF-beta superfamily of peptides that functions in a number of processes, including blood-cell development. We report here that Smad7 expression is specifically absent in particular hematopoietic cells that respond to activin by differentiating into the erythroid lineage and that ectopic production of Smad7 causes mouse erythroid leukemia (F5-5) cells to become resistant to activin induction of erythroid differentiation. When coexpressed with type I activin receptor ActR-I or ActR-IB in concert with type II receptor ActR-II, Smad7 efficiently reduced an early transcriptional response mediated by ActR-I but had only a minimal effect on the response mediated by ActR-IB. In the presence of Smad7, overexpression of an activated form of ActR-IB, but not of an activated form of ActR-I, induced F5-5 cells to differentiate. These results suggest that Smad7 selectively interferes with the ActR-I pathway in activin signal transduction. The findings also indicate the existence of a novel activity of Smad7 that inhibits erythroid differentiation by blocking intracellular signaling of activin.","['Kitamura, K', 'Aota, S i', 'Sakamoto, R', 'Yoshikawa, S I', 'Okazaki, K']","['Kitamura K', 'Aota Si', 'Sakamoto R', 'Yoshikawa SI', 'Okazaki K']","['Department of Molecular Biology, Biomolecular Engineering Research Institute, Osaka, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['3T3 Cells', 'Activin Receptors', 'Activins', 'Animals', 'CHO Cells', 'Cell Differentiation/*physiology', 'Cell Line', 'Cricetinae', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/*physiology', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Inhibins/*physiology', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute', 'Mice', 'Receptors, Growth Factor/physiology', 'Recombinant Proteins/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/*physiology', 'Smad7 Protein', 'Trans-Activators/genetics/*physiology', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2000/05/29 09:00,2000/07/06 11:00,['2000/05/29 09:00'],"['2000/05/29 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/07/06 11:00 [medline]', '2000/05/29 09:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)64000-9 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 2000 Jun 1;95(11):3371-9.,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Growth Factor)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (SMAD7 protein, human)', '0 (Smad7 Protein)', '0 (Smad7 protein, mouse)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '104625-48-1 (Activins)', '57285-09-3 (Inhibins)', 'EC 2.7.11.30 (Activin Receptors)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Seven human G-CSFR mRNA isoforms exist, named class I through class VII. The 183-amino acid cytosolic domain of the class I isoform provides all signaling activities. The class IV isoform is ""differentiation defective"" because the carboxy-terminal 87 amino acids are replaced with 34 amino acids of novel sequence. In more than 50% of AML samples, the class IV/class I G-CSFR mRNA ratio is aberrantly elevated compared to normal CD34(+) bone marrow cells. We hypothesized that the increased relative expression of class IV G-CSFR in AML uncouples proliferative and maturational G-CSFR signaling pathways. To test this, we transfected the G-CSF-responsive murine cell line 32Dcl3 with class IV G-CSFR cDNA. After 10 days of G-CSF stimulation, clones expressing class IV G-CSFR had greater percentages of myeloblasts and promyelocytes than controls (53% +/- 13% versus 3% +/- 2%). Differential counts over time demonstrated delayed G-CSF-driven maturation in 5 class IV-expressing clones, with 2 clones demonstrating a subpopulation that completely failed to differentiate. Heterologous class IV expression did not affect G-CSF-dependent proliferation. Class IV/murine G-CSFR mRNA ratios after 24 hours of G-CSF stimulation for 3 of the 5 clones (range, 0. 090 to 0.245; mean, 0.152 +/- 0.055) are within the range of class IV/class I mRNA ratios seen in patients with AML. This indicates that aberrantly increased relative class IV G-CSFR expression seen in AML can uncouple G-CSFR proliferative and maturational signaling pathways.","['White, S M', 'Alarcon, M H', 'Tweardy, D J']","['White SM', 'Alarcon MH', 'Tweardy DJ']","['Division of Infectious Diseases, Department of Medicine, University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, Pittsburgh, PA 15213, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/*pharmacology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology/drug effects/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Mitosis/drug effects', 'Neutrophils/*cytology/drug effects/physiology', 'Protein Isoforms/genetics/physiology', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Receptors, Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/genetics/*physiology', 'Recombinant Proteins/metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Transfection']",2000/05/29 09:00,2000/07/06 11:00,['2000/05/29 09:00'],"['2000/05/29 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/07/06 11:00 [medline]', '2000/05/29 09:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)63995-7 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 2000 Jun 1;95(11):3335-40.,"['0 (Protein Isoforms)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",,,,"['K11CA68480/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01CA72261/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We investigated data from 500 patients who relapsed before July 1996; follow-up was updated during 1998. The actuarial survival from relapse was 34.2% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 29. 9%-38.5%) at 5 years and 23.4% (95% CI: 18.9%-27.9%) at 10 years. Survival after relapse was significantly related to 5 factors: time from diagnosis to transplant (< 2 years vs >/= 2 years), disease phase at transplant (first chronic phase vs other), disease stage at relapse (cytogenetic or chronic phase vs advanced phase), time from transplant to relapse (< 1 year vs >/= 1 year), and donor type (HLA-identical sibling vs volunteer unrelated donor). The effects of individual adverse risk factors were cumulative: The probability of survival at 10 years decreased stepwise from 42% (0 factors), 32% (1 factor), 14% (2 factors), 3% (3 factors), to 0% (4 or 5 factors).

We studied the association between cell dose and outcome in 100 unmanipulated identical twin bone marrow transplantations for leukemia, reported to the International Bone Marrow Transplant Registry between 1985 and 1994, using Cox proportional hazards regression for multivariate analyses. Cell doses ranged from 0.3 to 7.4 x 10(8) nucleated cells/kg (median, 3.0 x 10(8)cells/kg). Median follow-up was 75 months. Five-year cumulative incidences of transplant-related mortality with high (more than 3 x 10(8) cells/kg) versus low (less than or equal to 3 x 10(8) cells/kg) cell doses were 2% (95% confidence interval [CI], 0% to 8%) versus 10% (95% CI, 4% to 20%), respectively.

Lower treatment failure resulted from fewer relapses in the high cell dose group (RR for relapse, 0.28; 95% CI, 1.2 to 0.66; P =.003).

German-Austrian-Swiss ALL-BFM Study Group.,3310-22,"Trial ALL-BFM 90 was designed to improve outcome in patients with childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) by using a reduced treatment regimen. Patients were stratified into a standard-risk group (SRG), a medium-risk group (MRG), both defined by adequate early treatment response; and a high-risk group (HRG), defined by inadequate response to the cytoreductive prednisone prephase, induction failure, or Philadelphia-chromosome-positive ALL. Four treatment modifications were evaluated: dose intensification in induction by a more rapid drug sequence; administration of L-asparaginase during consolidation therapy in the MRG (randomized); enforced consolidation by rotational elements in the HRG; and reduction in the dose of anthracyclines and use of only 12-Gy preventive cranial radiotherapy in the MRG and HRG, with the aim of avoiding toxicity. Among all 2178 patients (</= 18 years of age), the 6-year event-free survival (EFS) rate (+/- SE) was 78% +/- 1%, with a median observation time of 4.8 years. EFS was 85% +/- 2% in the SRG (n = 636) and 82% +/- 1% in the MRG (n = 1299). L-asparaginase did not improve outcome in the MRG: the event-free interval was 83% +/- 2% with L-asparaginase (n = 528) and 81% +/- 2% without it (n = 557). Because there were more systemic relapses in the HRG (n = 243), EFS was 34% +/- 3%, an outcome inferior to that in the HRG in a previous trial, ALL-BFM 86, in which EFS was 47% +/- 5% (P =.04). The rates of isolated central nervous system relapse in the MRG and HRG were 0.8% and 1.6%, respectively; thus, the 12-Gy preventive cranial radiotherapy regimen apparently provided sufficient central nervous system prophylaxis. The overall improvement over the results in ALL-BFM 86 (6-year EFS, 72%; P =. 001) was based on fewer recurrences among patients in the MRG with B-cell-precursor ALL, indicating an advantage of more condensed induction therapy.

The recipients of these transfusions were neutropenic stem cell transplantation patients with severe bacterial or fungal infection. Nineteen patients received 165 transfusions (mean 8.6 transfusions/patient, range 1-25). Community donors provided 94% of the transfusions; relatives accounted for only 6% of the transfusions. Sixty percent of the community donors initially contacted agreed to participate, and 98% of these individuals indicated willingness to participate again. Transfusion of 81.9 +/- 2.3 x 10(9) neutrophils (mean +/- SD) resulted in a mean 1-hour posttransfusion neutrophil increment of 2. 6 +/- 2.6 x 10(3)/microL and restored the peripheral neutrophil count to the normal range in 17 of the 19 patients. The buccal neutrophil response, a measure of the capacity of neutrophils to migrate to tissue sites in vivo, was restored to normal in most patients following the transfusion. Chills, fever, and arterial oxygen desaturation of >/= 3% occurred in 7% of the transfusions, but these changes were not sufficient to limit therapy.

The actuarial risk has varied, but has often been high if compared to the risk after conventional therapy. Prior chemotherapy with large cumulative doses of alkylating agents is the most important risk factor. In addition, patient age and previous radiotherapy, particularly the use of total body irradiation (TBI) in the preparative regimen for ASCT, have been identified as risk factors. In 3 studies, patients transplanted with CD34(+ )cells from peripheral blood after chemotherapy priming showed a higher risk of t-MDS or t-AML than patients transplanted with cells isolated from the bone marrow without priming. To what extent this higher risk relates to the prior therapy with a different contamination with preleukemic, hematopoietic precursors of the CD34(+) cells obtained by the 2 methods, or is a direct result of chemotherapy priming, or of an increasing awareness of these complications, remains to be determined. The latent period from ASCT to t-MDS and t-AML has often been short, 12 months or less in 27% of the patients. Bone marrow pathology of early cases of t-MDS after ASCT has often been neither diagnostic nor prognostic, but most patients presented chromosome aberrations, primarily deletions or loss of the long arms of chromosomes 5 and 7. The prognosis was in general poor, although 17% with indolent t-MDS survived more than 18 months from diagnosis, and most of these presented a normal karyotype or a single chromosome aberration.","['Pedersen-Bjergaard, J', 'Andersen, M K', 'Christiansen, D H']","['Pedersen-Bjergaard J', 'Andersen MK', 'Christiansen DH']","['Section for Hematology/Oncology, Cytogenetic Laboratory, Juliane Marie Center, Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen, Denmark.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*adverse effects', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*adverse effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/chemically induced/*etiology/genetics', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/chemically induced/*etiology/genetics', 'Neoplasms/drug therapy/*therapy', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/chemically induced/*etiology/genetics', 'Risk Factors', 'Transplantation, Autologous', 'Whole-Body Irradiation/adverse effects']",2000/05/29 09:00,2000/07/06 11:00,['2000/05/29 09:00'],"['2000/05/29 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/07/06 11:00 [medline]', '2000/05/29 09:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)63987-8 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 2000 Jun 1;95(11):3273-9.,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],62,,,,,,['Blood 2000 Sep 1;96(5):1680'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Forty-three consecutive procedures of immunomagnetic selection of CD34+ cells from peripheral blood HPCs and bone marrow harvests (autologous harvests, n = 27; allogeneic harvests; n=16) were performed by use of a cell selection system (Isolex 300i, Baxter Immunotherapy). The composition of the starting component and the subsets of CD34+ cells were analyzed for correlation with the yield and purity of the final component. RESULTS: The mean purity of the final components was 84.3 percent (range, 27-99%), and the mean yield was 51.4 percent (range, 9.4-80. 4%). Partial regression analysis showed that, among the factors correlating with purity and/or yield, the RBC volume in the starting fraction had the highest predictive impact on the purity and yield of CD34+ cells, even after the exclusion of procedures using bone marrow harvests as an HPC source (beta coefficient, -0.704; p = 0. 001). CONCLUSION: The use of the Isolex 300i system allows efficient recovery of CD34+ cells in routine selection procedures. The volume of RBCs in the starting component should be minimized to ensure a high yield and purity of the final component.","['Hildebrandt, M', 'Serke, S', 'Meyer, O', 'Ebell, W', 'Salama, A']","['Hildebrandt M', 'Serke S', 'Meyer O', 'Ebell W', 'Salama A']","['Departments of Internal Medicine (Blood Bank) and Pediatrics, Charite, Campus Virchow Klinikum, Humboldt University, Berlin, Germany. hildebra@charite.de']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Transfusion,Transfusion,0417360,IM,"['Antigens, CD34/*blood', 'Hematocrit', 'Humans', '*Immunomagnetic Separation/methods', 'Linear Models', 'Neuroblastoma/blood', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/blood', 'Sarcoma, Ewing/blood']",2000/05/29 09:00,2000/07/06 11:00,['2000/05/29 09:00'],"['2000/05/29 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/07/06 11:00 [medline]', '2000/05/29 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1046/j.1537-2995.2000.40050507.x [doi]'],ppublish,Transfusion. 2000 May;40(5):507-12. doi: 10.1046/j.1537-2995.2000.40050507.x.,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHOD: A MEDLINE search was performed to determine tuberculosis risk. A Markov model was used to analyze tuberculin skin test screening and preventive therapy for 3-year-old and 30-year-old persons with positive test results. Outcome measures were lifetime and 10-year tuberculosis risk, including spread to others, life expectancy extension, and number needed to screen and number needed to treat to prevent 1 case and 1 death during 10 years. RESULTS: The benefits of screening and preventive therapy outweigh the risks for all groups tested, although the benefits range from large to small. The number needed to screen to prevent 1 case is 10 to 6888, and the number needed to treat is 2 to 179. Persons with human immunodeficiency virus infection, intravenous drug abuse, or end-stage renal disease treated with transplantation and children exposed to high-risk adults have the highest tuberculosis rates and the lowest number needed to screen and number needed to treat to prevent cases and deaths. The range of risks found in the literature for some risk groups, such as persons with silicosis, leukemia or lymphoma, end-stage renal disease treated with dialysis, or prolonged corticosteroid therapy, is wide and, as a result, the benefits of screening are uncertain. CONCLUSIONS: The benefits of screening and preventive therapy vary widely, although the benefits outweigh the risks for all risk groups.

After various intervals recovery of viable cells was measured and expression of CD80, CD86, CD40, CD54, CD58, and CD11a was analyzed by flow cytometry. Functionally, DC derived from six AML samples were tested in a mixed lymphocyte response (MLR) using HLA-DR mismatched donor T cells as responder cells. Proliferation (5/14) or increased survival (7/14) of AML cells was observed in the presence of GM-CSF, SCF, and TNF-alpha. Only in the AML M2, M3, and M4 FAB subtypes proliferation was found. GM-CSF, SCF, and TNF-alpha induced morphologic changes typical for DC and increased the expression of costimulatory and adhesion molecules. No significant effect of IL-4 or gamma-interferon was observed. The day of maximal expression of these molecules varied. In cases with minor upregulation of CD80 or CD86, no further stimulation using CD40-L activation was observed.

In five out of six cases tested an increase in allostimulatory capacity was found at the day of maximal expression of costimulatory and adhesion molecules. In two patients a decrease in stimulatory capacity was found at day 7 compared with day 2 correlating with a decreased expression of these molecules.

The median growth inhibitory concentration (GC(50)) values were in the range 1.49-3.22 microM in cultures with 10% serum. Isothiocyanates and cysteine conjugates had increased potency against HL60 cells in serum-free medium, with GC(50) values of 0.8-0. 9 microM. The potency of the compounds decreased with increased serum content of the medium, but that of the cysteine conjugates decreased more markedly. Growth inhibition and toxicity was characterised by either a rapid interaction of the isothiocyanate with the cells in the first hour of culture or exposure to isothiocyanate liberated from the cysteine conjugate in the initial 3 hr of culture, inhibition of macromolecule synthesis, and a commitment to apoptosis which developed in the initial 24 hr. Activities of caspase-3 and caspase-8 were increased during isothiocyanate-induced apoptosis, but caspase-1 activity was not. The general caspase inhibitor N-benzyloxycarbonyl-Val-Ala-Asp(OMe)-fluoromethylketone and the specific caspase-8 inhibitor N-benzyloxycarbonyl-Ile-Glu(OMe)-Thr-Asp(OMe)-fluoromethylketone inhibited apoptosis, but specific caspase-1 and caspase-3 inhibitors did not. The antiproliferative activities were limited by hydrolysis of the isothiocyanate. This suggests that caspase-8 has a critical role, and caspase-3 a supporting role, in isothiocyanate-induced apoptosis in which p53 is not an obligatory participant. Isothiocyanate-induced apoptosis may suppress the growth of preclinical tumours and contribute to the well-established decreased cancer incidence associated with a vegetable-rich diet.","['Xu, K', 'Thornalley, P J']","['Xu K', 'Thornalley PJ']","['Department of Biological Sciences, University of Essex, Central Campus, Wivenhoe Park, CO4 3SQ, Essex, Colchester, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Biochem Pharmacol,Biochemical pharmacology,0101032,IM,"['Anticarcinogenic Agents/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis', 'Caspase 3', 'Caspase 8', 'Caspase 9', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Chemoprevention', 'Cysteine/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'DNA, Neoplasm/biosynthesis', '*Diet', 'Food Preservatives/pharmacology', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Hydrolysis', 'Isothiocyanates/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia', 'Lymphocytes/cytology/drug effects', 'RNA, Neoplasm/biosynthesis', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2000/05/29 09:00,2000/06/24 11:00,['2000/05/29 09:00'],"['2000/05/29 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/06/24 11:00 [medline]', '2000/05/29 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-2952(00)00319-1 [pii]', '10.1016/s0006-2952(00)00319-1 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Pharmacol. 2000 Jul 15;60(2):221-31. doi: 10.1016/s0006-2952(00)00319-1.,"['0 (Anticarcinogenic Agents)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Food Preservatives)', '0 (Isothiocyanates)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '6U7TFK75KV (phenethyl isothiocyanate)', 'BN34FX42G3 (allyl isothiocyanate)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP8 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP9 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 8)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 9)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'K848JZ4886 (Cysteine)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, the relative positions of the chromosome 15 centromere and the imprinted SNRPN gene in interphase nuclei of human myeloid leukemia HL60 cells were compared, because the homologous association of this imprinted chromosomal domain was previously observed in lymphocytes and lymphoblasts. Four targets including the chromosome 15 territory, its centromere, the SNRPN gene on this chromosome, and the nucleus, were visualized simultaneously in three-dimensionally preserved nuclei using multicolor fluorescence in situ hybridization, and the spatial distributions of these probes were analyzed with a cooled CCD camera deconvolution system. We found that preferential association of SNRPN interhomologues did not occur during the cell cycle in HL60 cells, although this gene exhibited asynchronous replication and monoallelic expression in this cells. SNRPN was found to localize at the periphery of the chromosome territories, and it preferentially faced the nuclear membrane, unlike the adjacent centromeric repeat. The SNRPN gene and the centromere were located close to each other late in S phase, reflecting that these DNA segments may be compacted into the same intranuclear subcompartments with the progress of S phase and in course of preparation for the following G(2) phase. Our results suggest that, although an imprinted gene has features similar to those observed with intranuclear localization of other gene coding sequences, the characteristic of mutual recognition of imprinted regions is determined by certain cellular regulation, and it is not necessary for the allele-specific features of an imprinted gene.","['Nogami, M', 'Kohda, A', 'Taguchi, H', 'Nakao, M', 'Ikemura, T', 'Okumura, K']","['Nogami M', 'Kohda A', 'Taguchi H', 'Nakao M', 'Ikemura T', 'Okumura K']","['Laboratory of Molecular and Cellular Biology, Faculty of Bioresources, Mie University, Tsu, Mie 514-8507, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,J Cell Sci,Journal of cell science,0052457,IM,"['Autoantigens/*genetics', 'Cell Cycle/*genetics', 'Centromere/*genetics', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 15/*genetics', '*Genomic Imprinting', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', '*Ribonucleoproteins, Small Nuclear', 'snRNP Core Proteins']",2000/05/29 09:00,2000/09/09 11:01,['2000/05/29 09:00'],"['2000/05/29 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/09/09 11:01 [medline]', '2000/05/29 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Cell Sci. 2000 Jun;113 ( Pt 12):2157-65.,"['0 (Autoantigens)', '0 (Ribonucleoproteins, Small Nuclear)', '0 (SNRPN protein, human)', '0 (snRNP Core Proteins)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A yeast two-hybrid screen of a fetal liver-hematopoietic cDNA library using PBX1a as bait led to the discovery of a novel non-homeodomain-containing protein that interacts with PBX1 as well as PBX2 and PBX3. RNA analysis revealed it to be expressed in CD34(+) hematopoietic cell populations enriched in primitive progenitors, as is PBX1; search of the expressed sequence tag data base indicated that it is also expressed in other early embryonic as well as adult tissues. The full-length cDNA encodes a 731-amino acid protein that has no significant homology to known proteins. This protein that we have termed hematopoietic PBX-interacting protein (HPIP) is mainly localized in the cytosol and in small amounts in the nucleus. The region of PBX that interacts with HPIP includes both the homeodomain and immediate N-terminal flanking sequences. Strikingly, electrophoretic mobility shift assays revealed that HPIP inhibits the ability of PBX-HOX heterodimers to bind to target sequences. Moreover, HPIP strongly inhibits the transactivation activity of E2A-PBX. Together these findings suggest that HPIP is a new regulator of PBX function.","['Abramovich, C', 'Shen, W F', 'Pineault, N', 'Imren, S', 'Montpetit, B', 'Largman, C', 'Humphries, R K']","['Abramovich C', 'Shen WF', 'Pineault N', 'Imren S', 'Montpetit B', 'Largman C', 'Humphries RK']","['Terry Fox Laboratory, British Columbia Cancer Agency, Vancouver, British Columbia V5Z 1L3, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Co-Repressor Proteins', 'DNA/*metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*metabolism', 'Hematopoiesis', 'Homeodomain Proteins/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Pre-B-Cell Leukemia Transcription Factor 1', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/chemistry/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Transcriptional Activation/drug effects', 'Transfection']",2000/05/29 09:00,2000/09/30 11:01,['2000/05/29 09:00'],"['2000/05/29 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/09/30 11:01 [medline]', '2000/05/29 09:00 [entrez]']","['10.1074/jbc.M001323200 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(19)61581-4 [pii]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2000 Aug 25;275(34):26172-7. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M001323200.,"['0 (Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors)', '0 (Co-Repressor Proteins)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (PBXIP1 protein, human)', '0 (Pre-B-Cell Leukemia Transcription Factor 1)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (TCF3 protein, human)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (pbx1 protein, human)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",,,,['DK48642/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have investigated the genetic etiology of an unusual three-generation family with apparent autosomal dominant transmission of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) accompanied by somatic loss of the long arm of chromosome 5 and/or loss of heterozygosity (LOH) analysis and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) of leukemia cells have been performed, confirming acquired hemi- and homozygous deletion of the long arm of chromosome 5. However, the chromosome lost in the observed LOH event is from the affected parent, in contradiction to the expectation for a two-hit hypothesis involving a tumor suppressor gene. Furthermore, genetic linkage has been performed at 5q31-33 as well as other loci (21q22 and 16q21-23.2) previously implicated in familial leukemia. In this family, linkage analysis excludes loci at 5q31-33 and 21q22, but localization to 16q21-23.2 cannot be excluded. We observed a maximum multipoint LOD score of 1.19 between marker D16S265 and D16S503 at 16q22 (P = 0.03), suggesting possible linkage to this locus. Considering this family and the previous 16q-linked family together, the linkage of a leukemia susceptibility gene to 16q22 achieved an LOD score of 3.63 at D16S265 with theta = 0. Thus, somatic deletion of the long arm of chromosome 5 appears as a necessary but surprisingly noncausative event for onset of AML and MDS in this family, thereby confirming a multistep etiology in which chromosome 5 plays an important secondary role.","['Gao, Q', 'Horwitz, M', 'Roulston, D', 'Hagos, F', 'Zhao, N', 'Freireich, E J', 'Golomb, H M', 'Olopade, O I']","['Gao Q', 'Horwitz M', 'Roulston D', 'Hagos F', 'Zhao N', 'Freireich EJ', 'Golomb HM', 'Olopade OI']","['Section of Hematology/Oncology, University of Chicago, Illinois 60637, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Genes Chromosomes Cancer,"Genes, chromosomes & cancer",9007329,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', '*Chromosome Deletion', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 16/genetics', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 5/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 7/*genetics', 'Female', 'Genetic Linkage', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease/*genetics', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*genetics/*pathology', 'Loss of Heterozygosity', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Pedigree']",2000/05/29 09:00,2000/07/25 11:00,['2000/05/29 09:00'],"['2000/05/29 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/07/25 11:00 [medline]', '2000/05/29 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/(SICI)1098-2264(200006)28:2<164::AID-GCC5>3.0.CO;2-2 [pii]'],ppublish,Genes Chromosomes Cancer. 2000 Jun;28(2):164-72.,,,,,"['ACS RPG-95-100-03-MGO/PG/OAPP OPHS HHS/United States', 'CA68341/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The reasons for splenic preservation may have influenced nontraumatic surgical management as well. To investigate the changing incidence and indications for splenectomy, we conducted a 10-year review of all splenectomies at our institution. During this time, between January 1, 1986, and December 31, 1995, 896 patients underwent splenectomy. Hospital charts and records were examined to determine the etiology and incidence of splenectomy. Indications were classified as: 1) trauma, i.e., performed for blunt or penetrating injury; 2) hematologic malignancy, i.e., therapy or staging of underlying leukemia, Hodgkin's lymphoma, or non-Hodgkin's lymphoma; 3) cytopenia, i.e., treatment of thrombocytopenia, anemia, or leukopenia; 4) iatrogenic, i.e., injury during another procedure; 5) incidental, i.e., required for adjacent organ resection; 6) portal hypertension, i.e., left-sided portal hypertension or during shunting procedure; 7) diagnostic, i.e., uncertainty excluding hematologic malignancy; or 8) other, i.e., miscellaneous indications. Trauma accounted for 41.5 per cent of all splenectomies during this time period, hematologic malignancy 15.4 per cent, cytopenia 15.6 per cent, incidental 12.3 per cent, iatrogenic 8.1 per cent, portal hypertension 2.3 per cent, diagnostic 2.0 per cent, and other 2.7 per cent. Comparing the first and second 5-year time periods, the following increases/decreases in average annual incidence were noted: splenectomy for all indications, -36.9 per cent; trauma, -32.9 per cent; hematologic malignancy, -51.4 per cent; cytopenia, 35.1 per cent; incidental, -35.9 per cent; iatrogenic, -30.2 per cent; diagnostic, +4.9 per cent, and other, -57 per cent. Traumatic injury to the spleen remains the most common indication for splenectomy, but the incidence has decreased dramatically over the past 10 years. Splenectomies for treatment of hematologic malignancies and cytopenia, as well as incidental and iatrogenic splenectomies, have also decreased significantly. Only the incidence of diagnostic splenectomy has remained stable. Although initiated within the field of trauma, the advantages of splenic preservation now appear to be well recognized beyond that field.","['Rose, A T', 'Newman, M I', 'Debelak, J', 'Pinson, C W', 'Morris, J A Jr', 'Harley, D D', 'Chapman, W C']","['Rose AT', 'Newman MI', 'Debelak J', 'Pinson CW', 'Morris JA Jr', 'Harley DD', 'Chapman WC']","['Department of Surgery, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, Tennessee 37232-4753, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Am Surg,The American surgeon,0370522,IM,"['Humans', 'Spleen/*injuries/*surgery', 'Splenectomy/*statistics & numerical data', 'Splenic Diseases/*surgery']",2000/05/29 09:00,2000/06/10 09:00,['2000/05/29 09:00'],"['2000/05/29 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/06/10 09:00 [medline]', '2000/05/29 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Am Surg. 2000 May;66(5):481-6.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Most cyanine dyes derived from dimethylindole were better photoprotectors than cyanine dyes with other structures. This correlated with the fact that cyanine dyes derived from dimethylindole were predominately monomeric at millimolar concentrations within K562 cells, while other cyanine dyes formed aggregates. For cyanine dyes that are derived from dimethylindole and have absorption band wavelengths greater than 700 nm, fluorescence-energy transfer from TPPS2 to the cyanine dye was the most important mechanism for photoprotection. There was no spectroscopic evidence for complex formation between the cyanine dyes and TPPS2. The dimethylindole derivative, 1,1',3,3,3',3'-hexamethylindodicarbocyanine, was an excellent photoprotector, but a poor quencher of TPPS2 fluorescence and a relatively poor singlet-oxygen quencher. This cyanine dye may act by quenching excited triplet TPPS2. Singlet-oxygen quenching may contribute to the photoprotection provided by cyanine dyes not derived from dimethylindole. Differences in the subcellular distribution of the various cyanine dyes studied may have contributed to the different apparent mechanisms of photoprotection.","['Sima, P D', 'Kanofsky, J R']","['Sima PD', 'Kanofsky JR']","['Department of Veterans Affairs Hospital, Hines, IL 60141, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",United States,Photochem Photobiol,Photochemistry and photobiology,0376425,IM,"['Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Coloring Agents/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Cyanides/chemistry', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', '*Light', 'Photosensitizing Agents/*pharmacology', 'Porphyrins/*pharmacology', 'Radiation-Protective Agents/chemistry/*pharmacology']",2000/05/29 09:00,2000/06/10 09:00,['2000/05/29 09:00'],"['2000/05/29 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/06/10 09:00 [medline]', '2000/05/29 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1562/0031-8655(2000)071<0413:cdapok>2.0.co;2 [doi]'],ppublish,Photochem Photobiol. 2000 Apr;71(4):413-21. doi: 10.1562/0031-8655(2000)071<0413:cdapok>2.0.co;2.,"['0 (Coloring Agents)', '0 (Cyanides)', '0 (Photosensitizing Agents)', '0 (Porphyrins)', '0 (Radiation-Protective Agents)', '35218-75-8 (tetraphenylporphine sulfonate)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, we performed PCR combined with denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) on fresh frozen biopsy samples from 16 patients with cutaneous T-lymphoproliferative diseases in whom a definite diagnosis was difficult to make on morphological and immunohistochemical grounds alone. Ages of the patients at biopsy ranged from 28 to 81 (median 62) years, and the subjects consisted of 8 men and 8 women. They presented with erythema on the extremities in 5 cases, trunk in 7, buttock in 2, and papules on the trunk and face in one case each. Clonal rearrangement of TCR gamma was observed in 3 of 16 cases. Clinical diagnoses of these three cases were mycosis fungoides, cutaneous invasion of adult T-cell leukemia (ATL), and large granular lymphocytic leukemia (LGL) of T-cell type, respectively, but they were histologically difficult to differentiate from reactive cutaneous T-cell proliferation. The skin lesions of the LGL case worsened, and this patient died two years after biopsy. Another patient with suspected mycosis fungoides in the plaque stage died due to dissemination of tumors 22 months after biopsy. The remaining one patient with ATL survived with cutaneous lesions for over four years. Clonality was not demonstrated in the remaining 13 cases, and their clinical courses were favorable. These findings showed that demonstration of clonal TCR gamma gene rearrangement using the PCR-DGGE method is very helpful for diagnosis of cutaneous T-cell neoplasms.","['Nagasawa, T', 'Nakatsuka, S', 'Miwa, H', 'Kanno, H', 'Itami, S', 'Yoshikawa, K', 'Aozasa, K']","['Nagasawa T', 'Nakatsuka S', 'Miwa H', 'Kanno H', 'Itami S', 'Yoshikawa K', 'Aozasa K']","['Department of Pathology, Osaka University Medical School, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,J Dermatol,The Journal of dermatology,7600545,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'Female', '*Gene Rearrangement, gamma-Chain T-Cell Antigen Receptor', 'Genes, T-Cell Receptor gamma/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Lymphoma, T-Cell, Cutaneous/*diagnosis/genetics/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Skin Neoplasms/*diagnosis/genetics/pathology']",2000/05/29 09:00,2000/07/06 11:00,['2000/05/29 09:00'],"['2000/05/29 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/07/06 11:00 [medline]', '2000/05/29 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1346-8138.2000.tb02158.x [doi]'],ppublish,J Dermatol. 2000 Apr;27(4):238-43. doi: 10.1111/j.1346-8138.2000.tb02158.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Acidic residues and sulfotyrosines in the amino-terminal domain (Nt) of CCR5 are crucial for viral fusion and entry. We tested the binding of a panel of CCR5 Nt peptides to different soluble gp120/CD4 complexes and anti-CCR5 mAbs. The tyrosine residues in the peptides were sulfated, phosphorylated, or unmodified. None of the gp120/CD4 complexes associated with peptides containing unmodified or phosphorylated tyrosines. The gp120/CD4 complexes containing envelope glycoproteins from isolates that use CCR5 as a coreceptor associated with Nt peptides containing sulfotyrosines but not with peptides containing sulfotyrosines in scrambled Nt sequences. Finally, only peptides containing sulfotyrosines inhibited the entry of an R5 isolate.

Type 1 cytokines (interleukin-2 [IL-2], IL-12, and gamma interferon) increase in freshly isolated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of animals with an early disease stage of bovine leukemia virus (BLV) infection, while IL-10 increases in animals with a late disease stage. Although IL-10 has an immunosuppressive role in the host immune system, IL-10 also inhibits BLV tax and pol mRNA levels in vitro. In contrast, IL-2 stimulates BLV tax and pol mRNA and p24 protein expression in cultured PBMCs. The inhibitory effect of IL-10 on BLV expression depends on soluble factors secreted by macrophages. Thus, we hypothesized that PGE(2), a cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2) product of macrophages, may regulate BLV expression. Here, we show that the level of COX-2 mRNA was decreased in PBMCs treated with IL-10, while IL-2 enhanced the level of COX-2 mRNA. Addition of PGE(2) stimulated BLV tax and pol mRNA levels and reversed the IL-10 inhibition of BLV mRNA. In addition, the specific COX-2 inhibitor, NS-398, inhibited the amount of BLV mRNA detected. Addition of PGE(2) increased BLV tax mRNA regardless of NS-398 addition. PGE(2) inhibited antigen-specific PBMC stimulation, suggesting that stimulation of BLV tax and pol mRNA levels by PGE(2) is independent of cell proliferation. These findings suggest that macrophage-derived COX-2 products, such as PGE(2), regulate virus expression and disease progression in BLV infection.","['Pyeon, D', 'Diaz, F J', 'Splitter, G A']","['Pyeon D', 'Diaz FJ', 'Splitter GA']","['Department of Animal Health and Biomedical Sciences, University of Wisconsin-Madison, Madison, Wisconsin 53706, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,IM,"['Animals', 'Autocrine Communication', 'Cattle', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cyclooxygenase 2', 'Cyclooxygenase 2 Inhibitors', 'Cyclooxygenase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Dinoprostone/*pharmacology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Viral/drug effects', 'Gene Products, pol/*genetics', 'Gene Products, tax/*genetics', 'Interleukin-10/antagonists & inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Interleukin-2/*pharmacology', 'Isoenzymes/*genetics/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Leukemia Virus, Bovine/*drug effects/genetics/immunology/physiology', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/drug effects/enzymology/immunology/virology', 'Lymphocyte Activation/drug effects', 'Models, Biological', 'Nitrobenzenes/pharmacology', 'Prostaglandin-Endoperoxide Synthases/*genetics/metabolism/pharmacology', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'RNA, Viral/genetics/metabolism', 'Sulfonamides/pharmacology']",2000/05/24 09:00,2000/07/06 11:00,['2000/05/24 09:00'],"['2000/05/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/07/06 11:00 [medline]', '2000/05/24 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/jvi.74.12.5740-5745.2000 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 2000 Jun;74(12):5740-5. doi: 10.1128/jvi.74.12.5740-5745.2000.,"['0 (Cyclooxygenase 2 Inhibitors)', '0 (Cyclooxygenase Inhibitors)', '0 (Gene Products, pol)', '0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Isoenzymes)', '0 (Nitrobenzenes)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Viral)', '0 (Sulfonamides)', '123653-11-2 (N-(2-cyclohexyloxy-4-nitrophenyl)methanesulfonamide)', '130068-27-8 (Interleukin-10)', 'EC 1.14.99.1 (Cyclooxygenase 2)', 'EC 1.14.99.1 (Prostaglandin-Endoperoxide Synthases)', 'K7Q1JQR04M (Dinoprostone)']",,PMC112065,,['R01CA59127/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

By coimmunoprecipitation and reverse transcription-PCR analyses, we demonstrate that hStau is associated with HIV-1 genomic RNA in HIV-1-expressing cells and purified virus. Overexpression of hStau enhances virion incorporation levels, and a corresponding, threefold increase in HIV-1 genomic RNA encapsidation levels. This coordinated increase in hStau and genomic RNA packaging had a significant negative effect on viral infectivity.

To address these issues, the technique of methylation-specific PCR and bisulfite-sequencing was adapted to study the regulatory regions of ABL1 and other genes. In cell lines established from CML blast crisis, which only carry a single ABL1 allele nested within the BCR-ABL fusion gene, ABL1 promoters were universally methylated. In clinical samples from patients at advanced stages of the disease, both methylated and unmethylated promoter alleles were detectable. In colonies derived from single hematopoietic progenitors methylated and unmethylated promoter alleles were revealed as well. ABL1 methylation was was noted in the vast majority of colonies from blast crisis, but not chronic-phase CML. It was shown finally that ABL1 methylation does not reflect a generalized process and may be unique among DNA repair/genotoxic stress response genes.

Presenting features and treatment outcome of 39 B-lineage ALL patients with myeloid antigen coexpression (My+B) were compared with 112 B-lineage ALL patients without myeloid antigen coexpression (My-B) for similarity in demographic, clinical and laboratory features and their treatment outcome. My+B and My-B patients were treated with a uniform treatment protocol. Myeloid antigen coexpression was defined as more than 30% isolated leukemic cells positive for CD13 and/or CD33. The ages at diagnoses ranged from 2 months to 12 years. Median age was 4 years. The incidence of myeloid antigen coexpression was 23 per cent. Univariate analyses showed that presenting features were similar between My+B and My-B with regard to age, sex, race, FAB morphology, white cell count, hemoglobin level, platelet count, liver/spleen size, central nervous system or mediastinal involvement, presence of lymphadenopathy, and proportion of blast cells detected in the marrow.

In contrast, there have been very few reports of autoantibodies with reactivity to antigens located along mitotic chromosome arms, but not in interphase nuclei. The purpose of this study was to identify and characterize autoantibodies with reactivity to mitotic chromosomal antigens (MCAs) located exclusively on mitotic chromosome arms, and to determine if patients with these autoantibodies have common clinical features. METHODS: Routine immunofluorescence screening of serum samples referred for antinuclear antibody investigation over a 10-year period was used to identify autoantibodies to MCAs. MCAs were identified by exclusive immunofluorescence staining of mitotic chromosome arms with no staining of interphase nuclei. MCA-reactive sera were further characterized for patterns of staining on mitotic chromosome arms and sensitivities to chemical and enzymatic treatments, and for one of these sera, its ability to abrogate progression through mitosis when microinjected into cells. RESULTS: Of 60,000 sera screened for antinuclear antibodies by immunofluorescence, we identified three IgG autoantibodies reacting exclusively to MCAs. The anti-MCA autoantibodies did not react with condensed chromatin in spermatozoa or in apoptotic HeLa cells. Reactivity of all three sera was abrogated by treatment with protease, but not RNase, indicating that the MCAs are protein in nature and do not contain RNA epitopes. The three anti-MCA antibodies seem to react to three different antigens because they gave different patterns of staining of chromosome arms, reacted with chromosomes in different stages of mitosis, and displayed different sensitivities to treatment with DNase 1, salt, and phosphatases. Phosphatase treatment suggests that MCA1 and MCA2 contain serine/threonine phosphoepitope(s) and MCA3 tyrosine phosphoepitope(s). Loss of MCA2 reactivity to DNase 1 treatment and its retention after salt extraction suggests that it is a chromosomal scaffold protein. Sensitivity of all three MCAs to acid suggests that they are histone-like or histone-associated proteins. CONCLUSIONS: We report the identification of three novel MCA-reactive sera. Patient diagnoses included discoid lupus erythematosus, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, Sjogren's syndrome, and polymyalgia rheumatica. The reactivity of anti-MCA antibodies with phosphoepitopes is likely to explain restriction of immunofluorescence staining to chromosome arms during mitosis. Microinjection of MCA1-reactive antibodies led to metaphase arrest, without any change in morphology of the mitotic spindle or metaphase chromosomes suggesting that MCA1 may have a role in sister chromatid separation.","['Gitlits, V M', 'Macaulay, S L', 'Toh, B H', 'Sentry, J W']","['Gitlits VM', 'Macaulay SL', 'Toh BH', 'Sentry JW']","['Department of Pathology & Immunology, Monash Medical School, Victoria, Australia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,J Investig Med,Journal of investigative medicine : the official publication of the American Federation for Clinical Research,9501229,IM,"['Animals', 'Autoantibodies/*analysis', 'Autoantigens/*immunology', 'Autoimmune Diseases/*immunology', 'Chromosomes, Human/*immunology', 'Epitopes/*immunology', 'Female', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique, Indirect', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Phosphorylation', 'Rats', 'Spindle Apparatus/*immunology']",2000/05/24 09:00,2000/06/17 09:00,['2000/05/24 09:00'],"['2000/05/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/06/17 09:00 [medline]', '2000/05/24 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Investig Med. 2000 May;48(3):172-82.,"['0 (Autoantibodies)', '0 (Autoantigens)', '0 (Epitopes)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: We analyzed a total of 11 cases: 9 acute myeloid leukaemias (M4 and M5 subtypes in FAB classification), 1 lymphoid leukaemia, and 1 acute biphenotypic leukaemia. We studied bone marrow samples from all patients by using conventional cytogenetic techniques and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) with an MLL probe. We also analyzed the correlation between clinical features and genetic results. RESULTS: Cells from 6 patients showed to contain MLL rearrangements and these arose in all types of leukaemias included in this study. Some MLL rearrangements were detected by FISH in kariotypically normal cases or without cytogenetic evidence of 11q23 aberration. MLL gene duplication has been observed in two cases with M4 and biphenotypic leukaemia, respectively. The presence of MLL gene rearrangements does not shape a group of patients with a common clinical pattern. CONCLUSIONS: MLL rearrangements occurs in a wide variety of leukemias. These rearrangements should be screened by FISH techniques, taking into account that gene duplications could arise in cases with normal karyotype. MLL rearrangements appear to have a considerable clinicopathologic heterogeneity.","['Urioste, M', 'Arranz, E', 'Martinez-Delgado, B', 'Soto, C', 'Roman, A', 'Perez, I', 'Mayayo, M', 'Perez-Pons, C', 'Barroso, A', 'Benitez, J']","['Urioste M', 'Arranz E', 'Martinez-Delgado B', 'Soto C', 'Roman A', 'Perez I', 'Mayayo M', 'Perez-Pons C', 'Barroso A', 'Benitez J']","['Servicio de Genetica, Fundacion Jimenez Diaz, Madrid.']",['spa'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Spain,Sangre (Barc),Sangre,0404373,IM,"['Adult', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 11', '*Gene Rearrangement', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Acute/*genetics', '*Oncogenes', 'Translocation, Genetic']",2000/05/24 09:00,2000/06/17 09:00,['2000/05/24 09:00'],"['2000/05/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/06/17 09:00 [medline]', '2000/05/24 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Sangre (Barc). 1999 Dec;44(6):464-8.,,,,,,,,,Reordenamientos del gen MLL en las leucemias agudas.,,,,,,,,,,,,

We reviewed our experience with eleven patients who received DLI between 1995 and 1997. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The diagnoses prior to DLI were: chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) in chronic phase (CP) (two patients) or accelerated phase (two patients), acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) (two patients), acute lymphoid leukaemia (ALL) (two patients), and refractory anaemia with excess blasts under transformation (tRAEB) (three patients). The patients received a median of 1.72 x 10(8) CD3+ cells/Kg (range: 0.58 x 10(8) CD3+ cells/Kg). Four patients were infused cryopreserved cells. Six patients received interferon alpha (IFN alpha) concomitantly. RESULTS: Seven patients (four CML, one AML, one ALL, one tRAEB) obtained complete remission (CR). Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) was observed in all patients with CR and one without response. Marrow hypoplasia or severe bicytopenia occurred in four patients. Of all patients achieving CR, two died after relapsing within 3 months of DLI, while three others died of GVHD. Four patients had no response to DLI or were not evauable. Only two patients--both with CML--are alive 1096 and 374 days after DLI, the former in clinical, cytogenetic and molecular CR, and the latter in second CP after 2 months in CR. CONCLUSIONS: DLI results in CR in most patients with relapsing leukaemia or myelodysplasia after BMT, especially in CML patients. The anti-leukaemia effect is highly correlated with GVHD. This complication and marrow hypoplasia remain major causes of morbidity and mortality of this procedure.","['Sanz Rodriguez, C', 'Steegmann, J L', 'Granda, A', 'de la Camara, R', 'Figuera, A', 'Arranz, R', 'Gomez-Garcia de Soria, V', 'Alegre, A', 'Fernandez-Ranada, J M']","['Sanz Rodriguez C', 'Steegmann JL', 'Granda A', 'de la Camara R', 'Figuera A', 'Arranz R', 'Gomez-Garcia de Soria V', 'Alegre A', 'Fernandez-Ranada JM']","['Servicio de Hematologia, Hospital Universitario de la Princesa, Madrid.']",['spa'],"['Case Reports', 'English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Spain,Sangre (Barc),Sangre,0404373,IM,"['Adult', 'Blood Donors', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukapheresis', 'Leukemia/*therapy', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/therapy', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/therapy', '*Leukocyte Transfusion', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/therapy', 'Recurrence']",2000/05/24 09:00,2000/06/17 09:00,['2000/05/24 09:00'],"['2000/05/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/06/17 09:00 [medline]', '2000/05/24 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Sangre (Barc). 1999 Dec;44(6):456-63.,,,,,,,,,Tratamiento de la recidiva leucemica post-trasplante alogenico de medula osea con infusion de leucocitos del donante: a proposito de 11 casos.,,,,,,,,,,,,

RESULTS: The most commonly detected secondary lesions were reactions to cyclophosphamide and/or methotrexate. In general, this mucositis appeared 5-7 days after treatment and continued for 1-2 weeks before regressing without residue. Another post-radiotherapeutic complication observed was xerostomy.

However, in 1980, successful cloning of the mature human alpha-A interferon led to the production of large quantities of bacterially synthesized human alpha-A interferon, now designated interferon alfa-2a (Roferon-A, Hoffmann-La Roche, Nutley, NJ). This abundance of alfa-2a made possible clinical studies of alpha interferon's capacity to suppress CML Philadelphia (Ph1) clones as well as restore the cells with normal karyotype. The data resulting from these clinical trials indicate that interferon alfa-2a is effective in inducing hematologic remissions in the majority of minimally treated, benign-phase CML, Ph1-positive patients.

Corticosteroids have limited value; both corticosteroids and chemotherapy are associated with substantial risks of infection. The mainstay of therapy has been splenectomy. Improvement is seen in 50% to 70% of patients with cytopenias; although the impact of splenectomy on survival has not been clearly demonstrated, prolonged hematologic improvement can occur. Splenectomy presumably alleviates the pancytopenic effect of hypersplenism by removing the preferred site of leukemic cell proliferation. Human interferon represents a major advance in management. Favorable results with natural leukocyte alpha interferon have been confirmed by data with biosynthetic (recombinant) alpha interferon. Importantly, the incidence of infection has been clearly shown to decrease, suggesting improved survival in patients with advanced hairy cell leukemia. Many questions regarding interferon therapy remain unanswered, including optimal dose, optimal duration, and maintenance therapy after maximal response. The mechanism of action is unclear, but possibly interferon modulates as yet unidentified lymphokines or growth factors. In vitro evidence suggests a direct antiproliferative effect of type I interferon on hairy cells. Preliminary data suggest that although toxicity issues, including induction of immunodeficiency and renal insufficiency require further clarification, deoxycoformycin, an adenosine deaminase inhibitor, is also highly effective and holds substantial promise as an important therapeutic modality.","['Glaspy, J A', 'Jacobs, A D', 'Golde, D W']","['Glaspy JA', 'Jacobs AD', 'Golde DW']","['Department of Medicine, UCLA School of Medicine, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,IM,"['Adrenal Cortex Hormones/adverse effects', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Agents/adverse effects', 'Humans', 'Hypersplenism/prevention & control', 'Interferon Type I/therapeutic use', 'Interferon-alpha/therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Hairy Cell/*therapy', 'Pancytopenia/prevention & control', 'Pentostatin/therapeutic use', 'Recombinant Proteins', 'Risk Factors', 'Splenectomy', 'Survival Rate']",1987/02/01 00:00,2000/06/17 09:00,['1987/02/01 00:00'],"['1987/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2000/06/17 09:00 [medline]', '1987/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/1097-0142(19870201)59:3+<652::aid-cncr2820591314>3.0.co;2-a [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 1987 Feb 1;59(3 Suppl):652-7. doi: 10.1002/1097-0142(19870201)59:3+<652::aid-cncr2820591314>3.0.co;2-a.,"['0 (Adrenal Cortex Hormones)', '0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Interferon Type I)', '0 (Interferon-alpha)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '395575MZO7 (Pentostatin)']",76,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Ectopic expression of the ets related transcription factor Fli-1 in these cells resulted in the establishment of the Epo-dependent cell line HB60-ED that proliferates in the presence of Epo. In this study, we utilized these two cell lines to examine the signal transduction pathways that are activated in response to Epo and SCF stimulation. We demonstrate that Epo, but not SCF, phosphorylates STAT-5 in both HB60-5 and HB60-ED cells. Interestingly, SCF activates the Shc/ras pathway in HB60-5 cells while Epo does not. However, both Epo and SCF are capable of activating the Shc/ras pathway in HB60ED cells. Furthermore, enforced expression of gp55 in HB60-5 cells by means of infection with the Spleen Focus Forming virus-P (SFFV-P), confers Epo independent growth, which is associated with the up-regulation of Fli-1. Activation of the Shc/ras pathway is readily detected in gp55 expressing cells in response to both Epo and SCF, and is associated with a block in STAT-5B tyrosine phosphorylation. These results suggest that STAT-5 activation, in the absence of Shc/ras activation, plays a role in erythroid differentiation. Moreover, Fli-1 is capable of switching Epo-induced differentiation to Epo-induced proliferation, suggesting that this ets factor regulated genes whose products modulate the Epo-Epo-R signal transduction pathway.","['Zochodne, B', 'Truong, A H', 'Stetler, K', 'Higgins, R R', 'Howard, J', 'Dumont, D', 'Berger, S A', 'Ben-David, Y']","['Zochodne B', 'Truong AH', 'Stetler K', 'Higgins RR', 'Howard J', 'Dumont D', 'Berger SA', 'Ben-David Y']","[""Department of Medical Biophysics, University of Toronto, Sunnybrook and Women's College Health Sciences Centre, Ontario, Canada.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,IM,"['*Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing', '*Adaptor Proteins, Vesicular Transport', 'Animals', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects/physiology', 'Cell Division/drug effects/physiology', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/metabolism', 'Erythropoiesis/physiology', 'Erythropoietin/*metabolism/pharmacology', '*Friend murine leukemia virus', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/drug therapy/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', '*Milk Proteins', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Proteins/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Protein c-fli-1', '*Proto-Oncogene Proteins', 'Receptors, Erythropoietin/metabolism', 'STAT5 Transcription Factor', 'Shc Signaling Adaptor Proteins', '*Signal Transduction', 'Src Homology 2 Domain-Containing, Transforming Protein 1', 'Stem Cell Factor/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Trans-Activators/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Viral Envelope Proteins/metabolism', 'ras Proteins/metabolism']",2000/05/24 09:00,2000/06/10 09:00,['2000/05/24 09:00'],"['2000/05/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/06/10 09:00 [medline]', '2000/05/24 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.onc.1203590 [doi]'],ppublish,Oncogene. 2000 May 4;19(19):2296-304. doi: 10.1038/sj.onc.1203590.,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (Adaptor Proteins, Vesicular Transport)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Fli1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Milk Proteins)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Protein c-fli-1)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Erythropoietin)', '0 (SHC1 protein, human)', '0 (STAT5 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Shc Signaling Adaptor Proteins)', '0 (Shc1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Src Homology 2 Domain-Containing, Transforming Protein 1)', '0 (Stem Cell Factor)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)', '0 (glycoprotein gp55, Friend spleen focus-forming virus)', '11096-26-7 (Erythropoietin)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (ras Proteins)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the present study we used the K562 human myeloid leukemia cell line as a model to study the functional interaction between c-Myc and p53. Using two different methods, we generated K562 transfectant cell lines with conditional expression of either c-Myc or p53. The cells expressed the p53Vall35 mutant, which adopts a wild-type conformation at 32 degrees C, while c-Myc induction was achieved with a zinc-inducible expression vector. We found that p53 in wild-type conformation induces growth arrest and apoptosis of K562. Expression of c-Myc significantly attenuated apoptosis and impaired the transcriptional activity of p53 on p21WAF1, Bax and cytomegalovirus promoters. The impairment of p21WAF1 transactivation by c-Myc was confirmed by transfection of a c-Myc-estrogen receptor fusion protein and by induction of c-myc by zinc in transfected cells. Also, p53-mediated up-regulation of p21WAF1 mRNA protein were significantly reduced by c-Myc, while Bax levels were unaffected. Consistently, c-Myc increased cyclin-dependent kinase 2 activity in K562 cells expressing p53 in wild-type conformation. These results suggest that c-Myc overexpression may antagonize the pro-apoptotic function of p53, thus providing a molecular mechanism for the frequently observed deregulation of c-myc in human cancer.","['Ceballos, E', 'Delgado, M D', 'Gutierrez, P', 'Richard, C', 'Muller, D', 'Eilers, M', 'Ehinger, M', 'Gullberg, U', 'Leon, J']","['Ceballos E', 'Delgado MD', 'Gutierrez P', 'Richard C', 'Muller D', 'Eilers M', 'Ehinger M', 'Gullberg U', 'Leon J']","['Departamento de Biologia Molecular, Unidad Asociada al Centro de Investigaciones Biologicas, Universidad de Cantabria, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,IM,"['*Apoptosis', 'Blast Crisis/*genetics', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21', 'Cyclins/*genetics', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc/genetics/*metabolism', 'Recombinant Proteins/metabolism', 'Transcriptional Activation', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/genetics/*metabolism', 'Up-Regulation']",2000/05/24 09:00,2000/06/10 09:00,['2000/05/24 09:00'],"['2000/05/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/06/10 09:00 [medline]', '2000/05/24 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.onc.1203541 [doi]'],ppublish,Oncogene. 2000 Apr 27;19(18):2194-204. doi: 10.1038/sj.onc.1203541.,"['0 (CDKN1A protein, human)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21)', '0 (Cyclins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Because these sequences are also present in the packaging genome, it has been suggested that homologous recombination may occur between the same nucleotide sequence in the packaging genome and the vector, resulting in the production of replication competent retrovirus (RCR). Up until now, it has been difficult to completely remove viral coding sequences since some were thought to be involved in the optimum function of the retroviral vector. For example, the gag coding sequence present in almost all available retroviral vectors has been believed to be necessary for efficient viral packaging, while the pol coding sequence present in the highly efficient vector MFG has been thought to be involved in achieving the high levels of gene expression. However, we have now developed a series of retroviral vectors that are absent of any retroviral coding sequences but produce even higher levels of gene expression without compromising viral titer. In these vectors, the intron and exon sequences from heterologous cellular or viral genes are present. When compared with the well-known MLV-based vectors, some of these newly developed vectors have been shown to produce significantly higher levels of gene expression for a longer period. In an experimental system that can maximize the production of RCR, our newly constructed vectors produced an absence of RCR. These vectors should prove to be safer than other currently available retroviral vectors containing one or more viral coding sequences.","['Yu, S S', 'Kim, J M', 'Kim, S']","['Yu SS', 'Kim JM', 'Kim S']","['Institute for Molecular Biology and Genetics, Seoul National University, Seoul, Korea.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Gene Ther,Gene therapy,9421525,IM,"['3T3 Cells', 'Animals', '*Genetic Engineering', 'Genetic Vectors/*genetics', 'Genome, Viral', 'Humans', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*genetics', 'Mice', 'Transfection']",2000/05/24 09:00,2000/06/17 09:00,['2000/05/24 09:00'],"['2000/05/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/06/17 09:00 [medline]', '2000/05/24 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.gt.3301164 [doi]'],ppublish,Gene Ther. 2000 May;7(9):797-804. doi: 10.1038/sj.gt.3301164.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The earliest event induced by drug exposure was increase in Bad protein levels, followed by Bcl-2 down-regulation, cytochrome c release, and Bcl-xL and Bax up-regulation. Bak accumulation was a late event. Activation of pro-caspase-3 and cleavage of Bcl-2 protein occurred in the HL-60 cells only, and followed the cytochrome c release. The overall responses were qualitatively similar in both cell types, but MCF-7 cells treated with Taxol showed a significant delay in apoptosis, correlating with early up-regulation of Bcl-2 and delayed release of cytochrome c. We conclude that Bad up-regulation is an early indicator of a cellular response that will lead to cell death, but may be modulated by survival mechanisms, which cumulatively govern the ultimate susceptibility to apoptosis.","['Tudor, G', 'Aguilera, A', 'Halverson, D O', 'Laing, N D', 'Sausville, E A']","['Tudor G', 'Aguilera A', 'Halverson DO', 'Laing ND', 'Sausville EA']","['Science Applications International Corporation, National Cancer Institute, Frederick Cancer Resource and Development Center, Frederick, P.O.

A major substrate of Bcr-Abl was recently identified as the RasGAP-associated 62 kDa docking protein Dok1. Here, we report complex formation between endogenous Dok1 and the SH2 domain-containing phosphatidylinositol polyphosphate 5-phosphatase SHIP1 in hematopoietic cells expressing Bcr-Abl. Expression of Bcr-Abl induced tyrosine phosphorylation of both Dok1 and SHIP1 and the formation of a Dok1/SHIP1 complex. Tyr(P) SHIP1 was also bound to Shc in Bcr-Abl expressing cells. A small amount of Shc/SHIP1/Dok1 trimolecular complex was detected and this was due to binding of Dok1 to SHIP1 that was bound to Shc. In contrast, association of Dok1 with SHIP1 or RasGAP was mutually exclusive. Both the SH2 domain of SHIP1 and the PTB domain of Dok1 were required for complex formation between the two proteins. Neither the specific activity of SHIP1 as an inositol phosphate 5-phosphatase nor the subcellular localization of SHIP1 appeared to be altered by tyrosine phosphorylation. However, the Dok1/SHIP1 complex was only detected in the cytosolic fraction of Bcr-Abl transformed hematopoietic cells. We propose that interaction between Dok1 and SHIP1 modulates the ability of these two proteins to interact with other cytosolic binding partners.","['Dunant, N M', 'Wisniewski, D', 'Strife, A', 'Clarkson, B', 'Resh, M D']","['Dunant NM', 'Wisniewski D', 'Strife A', 'Clarkson B', 'Resh MD']","['Cell Biology Program, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, 1275 York Avenue, Box 143, New York, NY 10021, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Cell Signal,Cellular signalling,8904683,IM,"['Animals', 'COS Cells', 'Cell Line, Transformed', '*DNA-Binding Proteins', '*Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl', 'GTP Phosphohydrolases/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive', 'Megakaryocytes/chemistry/cytology/*enzymology', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*genetics/metabolism', 'Phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-Trisphosphate 5-Phosphatases', 'Phosphoproteins/analysis/*metabolism', 'Phosphoric Monoester Hydrolases/analysis/*metabolism', 'Phosphotransferases (Alcohol Group Acceptor)/metabolism', 'Plasmids', 'Protein Binding/physiology', '*RNA-Binding Proteins', 'Signal Transduction/*physiology', 'Transfection', 'ras Proteins/metabolism']",2000/05/24 09:00,2000/08/29 11:01,['2000/05/24 09:00'],"['2000/05/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/08/29 11:01 [medline]', '2000/05/24 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0898-6568(00)00073-5 [pii]', '10.1016/s0898-6568(00)00073-5 [doi]']",ppublish,Cell Signal. 2000 May;12(5):317-26. doi: 10.1016/s0898-6568(00)00073-5.,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (DOK1 protein, human)', '0 (GAP-associated protein p62)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Phosphoproteins)', '0 (RNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (abl-bcr fusion protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (Phosphotransferases (Alcohol Group Acceptor))', 'EC 2.7.1.68 (1-phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate 5-kinase)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'EC 3.1.3.2 (Phosphoric Monoester Hydrolases)', 'EC 3.1.3.86 (INPPL1 protein, human)', 'EC 3.1.3.86 (Phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-Trisphosphate 5-Phosphatases)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (GTP Phosphohydrolases)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (RRAS protein, human)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (ras Proteins)']",,,,['P01 CA 64593/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

FTY720 causes cell death in vitro in lymphocytes and leukemia cells. However, the deletion mechanism of blood lymphocytes in vivo remains unclear. We investigated whether administration of FTY720 induced lymphocyte apoptosis in blood circulation. A marked decrease in the number of blood lymphocytes was observed within an hour after a single oral administration of FTY720 at doses of 5-10 mg/kg in rats and mice. Experiments using fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-Annexin V and APO-BRDU methods revealed that FTY720 induced blood lymphocyte apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner. On the other hand, lymphocyte homing to Peyer's patches was proposed as the mechanism underlying the blood lymphocyte decrease at these doses. However, similar results were obtained when using aly/aly mice, which lack Peyer's patches and lymph nodes. Thus, we concluded that apoptosis of blood lymphocytes was induced immediately after administration of FTY720, and the cells could be immediately scavenged by phagocytes or the reticuloendothelial system in addition to Peyer's patches homing. We also concluded that T cells were highly sensitive to FTY720, which induced apoptosis in vivo.","['Nagahara, Y', 'Enosawa, S', 'Ikekita, M', 'Suzuki, S', 'Shinomiya, T']","['Nagahara Y', 'Enosawa S', 'Ikekita M', 'Suzuki S', 'Shinomiya T']","[""Division of Research Promotion, National Children's Medical Research Center, 3-35-31 Taishido, Setagaya-ku, Tokyo 154-8509, Japan.""]",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",Netherlands,Immunopharmacology,Immunopharmacology,7902474,IM,"['Administration, Oral', 'Animals', 'Annexin A5', '*Apoptosis', 'B-Lymphocytes/drug effects', 'Cell Separation', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Down-Regulation', 'Fingolimod Hydrochloride', 'Fluorescein-5-isothiocyanate', 'Granulocytes/drug effects', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/*pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Monocytes/drug effects', 'Propylene Glycols/*pharmacology', 'Rats', 'Rats, Inbred Lew', 'Sphingosine/analogs & derivatives', 'T-Lymphocytes/cytology/*drug effects']",2000/05/24 09:00,2000/09/02 11:01,['2000/05/24 09:00'],"['2000/05/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/09/02 11:01 [medline]', '2000/05/24 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0162310900001818 [pii]', '10.1016/s0162-3109(00)00181-8 [doi]']",ppublish,Immunopharmacology. 2000 Jun;48(1):75-85. doi: 10.1016/s0162-3109(00)00181-8.,"['0 (Annexin A5)', '0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)', '0 (Propylene Glycols)', 'G926EC510T (Fingolimod Hydrochloride)', 'I223NX31W9 (Fluorescein-5-isothiocyanate)', 'NGZ37HRE42 (Sphingosine)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Thus, development of an ELISA for measurement of anti-asparaginase antibody levels is important in the clinical setting. An anti-asparaginase antibody reference was established by screening 65 plasma samples from six patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) who had recently developed a hypersensitivity reaction to Escherichia coli or Erwinia chrysanthemi asparaginase therapy. Twenty-one plasma samples were selected for the anti-asparaginase antibody reference pool. Five micrograms per milliliter of commercial E. coli and Erwinia asparaginase and 10 microg/ml of E. coli asparaginase conjugated with polyethylene glycol (PEG asparaginase) were found to be optimal as coating antigen concentrations. Anti-asparaginase antibody concentrations were determined using a commercial polyclonal goat anti-human IgG horseradish peroxidase conjugate. The antibody reference curves were linear in a range of absorbance from 0.1 to 1. 5 O.D. units for dilutions from 1:1600 to 1:51,200. Inter-assay coefficients of variation were 9.04, 14.7 and 13.0%, and intra-assay coefficients of variation were 1.44, 4.43 and 3.28% for antibodies against E. coli, Erwinia, and PEG L-asparaginase, respectively. The cut-off for positivity in plasma was determined as mean+2 S.D. of the optical density values for plasma from untreated healthy volunteers. Measurement of specific IgG by this ELISA allows for the evaluation of plasma anti-asparaginase antibody concentrations in patients receiving one or more of the multiple commercial L-asparaginase preparations.","['Wang, B', 'Hak, L J', 'Relling, M V', 'Pui, C H', 'Woo, M H', 'Storm, M C']","['Wang B', 'Hak LJ', 'Relling MV', 'Pui CH', 'Woo MH', 'Storm MC']","['Department of Clinical Pharmacy and the Center for Pediatric Pharmacokinetics and Therapeutics, College of Pharmacy, University of Tennessee, 26 South Dunlap Street, Memphis, TN, USA. bwang@utmem.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Netherlands,J Immunol Methods,Journal of immunological methods,1305440,IM,"['Absorption', 'Asparaginase/*immunology/therapeutic use', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay/*methods/standards', 'Erwinia/enzymology', 'Escherichia coli/enzymology', 'Horseradish Peroxidase', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin G/*blood', 'Indicators and Reagents', 'Linear Models', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/enzymology/*immunology', 'Reproducibility of Results']",2000/05/24 00:00,2000/05/24 00:01,['2000/05/24 00:00'],"['2000/05/24 00:00 [pubmed]', '2000/05/24 00:01 [medline]', '2000/05/24 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0022-1759(00)00182-4 [pii]', '10.1016/s0022-1759(00)00182-4 [doi]']",ppublish,J Immunol Methods. 2000 May 26;239(1-2):75-83. doi: 10.1016/s0022-1759(00)00182-4.,"['0 (Immunoglobulin G)', '0 (Indicators and Reagents)', 'EC 1.11.1.- (Horseradish Peroxidase)', 'EC 3.5.1.1 (Asparaginase)']",,,,"['CA21765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA51001/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Western analyses showed that continuous exposure for 48 h of HL-60 cells to the differentiation-inducing agents, all-trans retinoic acid, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3, or N-methylformamide, resulted in decreases in mitochondrial HSP70 (mtHSP70), with little change in the levels of HSP70, HSC70, and GRP78.

Slightly greater than twofold increases in mtHSP70 protein levels occurred in cells transfected with the mthsp70 cDNA. In vector-transfected HL-60 cells, myeloid differentiation, measured as an increase in CD31 expression and nitroblue tetrazolium positivity, was observed following 3-6 days of treatment with each of the three inducing agents. In contrast, cell differentiation induced by each agent was markedly attenuated in mthsp70-transfected HL-60 cells.

In an effort to isolate and characterize genes whose expression change during differentiation, we cloned and sequenced a cDNA of 715 bp (rpS5) from a MEL cDNA library. The cloned mouse cDNA showed significant degree of structural homology in both DNA and protein level to known human and rat genes that encode the S5 proteins of 40S ribosomal subunit. The use of 715-bp cDNA as probe revealed the presence of an RNA transcript in the cytoplasm of MEL and human neuroectodermal RD/TE-671 cells. The steady-state accumulation level of this RNA transcript decreased upon induction of differentiation of both cell lines by treatment with DMSO and UDP-4, two structurally different inducers. Blockade of MEL cell differentiation by the inhibitor N6-methyladenosine preserved the constitutive expression of the rpS5 gene. DNA methylation analysis at CCGG sites located at the rpS5 gene locus in undifferentiated and differentiated MEL cells revealed that the suppression of the rpS5 gene during MEL cell differentiation is not related to any change in methylation at these sites. Moreover, the rpS5 gene continued to be expressed in cells undergoing serum-deprived apoptosis, like in control untreated cells. Therefore, we conclude that there may be a disparate pattern of expression of the rpS5 gene in differentiating and apoptotic cells. These data can be valuable in understanding the role of ribosomal proteins during differentiation and cell death (apoptosis) of neoplastic cells, although there is no experimental evidence that the suppression of the rpS5 gene is related mechanistically to the induction of differentiation.

The reduction of the steady state levels of TNF-alpha mRNA in Jurkat cells was a result of destabilization of the gene as demonstrated by actinomycin D treatment; a half-life of TNF-alpha message in 5DHT treated cells and non-treated cells was 1 hr and 2.5 hr, respectively, whereas that in 5DHT/PHA and PHA-treated cells was 3hr and 6hr, respectively.","['Takei, S', 'Redford, A', 'Katayama, S', 'Toyoda, H']","['Takei S', 'Redford A', 'Katayama S', 'Toyoda H']","['Department of Medicine, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, UCLA School of Medicine, Los Angeles, California 90048, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Life Sci,Life sciences,0375521,IM,"['DNA Primers/chemistry', 'Dactinomycin/pharmacology', 'Dihydrotestosterone/*pharmacology', 'Gene Expression/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Phytohemagglutinins/pharmacology', 'RNA, Messenger/*metabolism', 'RNA, Neoplasm/analysis', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/*genetics/metabolism']",2000/05/23 09:00,2000/06/03 09:00,['2000/05/23 09:00'],"['2000/05/23 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/06/03 09:00 [medline]', '2000/05/23 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0024320500005269 [pii]', '10.1016/s0024-3205(00)00526-9 [doi]']",ppublish,Life Sci. 2000 Apr 7;66(20):PL277-82. doi: 10.1016/s0024-3205(00)00526-9.,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (Phytohemagglutinins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '08J2K08A3Y (Dihydrotestosterone)', '1CC1JFE158 (Dactinomycin)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Data on clinical and laboratory findings, treatment and outcomes were taken and analysed using binomial proportions and paired samples T-tests. It was found that KBTH patients presented with lower haemoglobin levels, bigger organ enlargements, received less intensive treatment and defaulted more often than HHOG patients. White blood cell(WBC) counts were statistically the same. Achievability of remission was 75% and 100% for KBTH and HHOG patients respectively. Average follow up was 6 months for KBTH patients and 69 months for HHOG. 60% of KBTH patients had defaulted at the time of the study. 75% of HHOG patients were alive at the time of study with the longest follow up being 114 months. It is concluded that in spite of the bigger organ enlargement for the KBTH patients, WBC count which is the single most important prognostic factor was the same for both groups, and with less intensive therapy, achievability of remission for KBTH was 75%--reasonably good.

This report is the joint effort of the American Cancer Society, the National Cancer Institute (NCI), the North American Association of Central Cancer Registries (NAACCR), and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), including the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS). METHODS: Age-adjusted rates were based on cancer incidence data from the NCI and NAACCR and underlying cause of death as compiled by NCHS. Joinpoint analysis was based on NCI Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) program incidence rates and NCHS death rates for 1973-1997. The prevalence of screening examinations for colorectal cancer was obtained from the CDC's Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System and the NCHS's National Health Interview Survey. RESULTS: Between 1990-1997, overall cancer incidence and death rates declined. Joinpoint analyses of cancer incidence and death rates confirmed the declines described in earlier reports. The incidence trends for colorectal cancer have shown recent steep declines for whites in contrast to a leveling off of the rates for blacks. State-to-state variations occurred in colorectal cancer screening prevalence as well as incidence and death rates. CONCLUSIONS: The continuing declines in overall cancer incidence and death rates are encouraging. However, a few of the top ten incidence or mortality cancer sites continued to increase or remained level. For many cancer sites, whites had lower incidence and mortality rates than blacks but higher rates than Hispanics, Asian and Pacific Islanders, and American Indians/Alaska Natives. The variations in colorectal cancer incidence and death rates by race/ethnicity, gender, age, and geographic area may be related to differences in risk factors, demographic characteristics, screening, and medical practice.

In a previous study, the authors revealed that certain patients with childhood acute leukemia and neuroblastoma had had rapid somatic growth after birth, suggesting the involvement of growth factor(s) in tumorigenesis. In the current study, the authors examined whether relaxation of IGF-2 imprinting occurred in infant leukemia and childhood neuroblastoma. METHODS: The genomic DNA of infant leukemia, childhood neuroblastoma, and control individuals was amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Patients who had heterozygous genotype were selected as informative cases using Apa I polymorphism in exon 9 of the IGF-2 gene. Total RNA was isolated from informative cases, followed by cDNA synthesis. cDNA was amplified by PCR, and direct sequence was performed for determining allele specific transcription. RESULTS: Twenty of 22 infant leukemia blasts and all of 16 neuroblastoma cells showed normal monoallelic expression of IGF-2 as well as 23 controls. The height and weight of two acute lymphoblastic leukemia patients with LOI were within normal ranges for Japanese children. CONCLUSIONS: The current study revealed that the imprinting status of IGF-2 was generally maintained in infant leukemia and confirmed that it was maintained in childhood neuroblastoma. The results suggest that LOI of IGF-2 does not play a major role in the carcinogenesis of these diseases or in rapid physical growth of the patients.","['Hattori, H', 'Matsuzaki, A', 'Suminoe, A', 'Ihara, K', 'Eguchi, M', 'Tajiri, T', 'Suita, S', 'Ishii, E', 'Hara, T']","['Hattori H', 'Matsuzaki A', 'Suminoe A', 'Ihara K', 'Eguchi M', 'Tajiri T', 'Suita S', 'Ishii E', 'Hara T']","['Department of Pediatrics, Graduate School of Medical Sciences, Kyushu University, Fukuoka, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,IM,"['Female', '*Genomic Imprinting', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Insulin-Like Growth Factor II/*genetics', 'Leukemia/*genetics', 'Male', 'Neuroblastoma/*genetics', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Polymorphism, Genetic']",2000/05/23 09:00,2000/06/17 09:00,['2000/05/23 09:00'],"['2000/05/23 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/06/17 09:00 [medline]', '2000/05/23 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/(SICI)1097-0142(20000515)88:10<2372::AID-CNCR23>3.0.CO;2-A [pii]'],ppublish,Cancer. 2000 May 15;88(10):2372-7.,['67763-97-7 (Insulin-Like Growth Factor II)'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The variable X residue is occupied by valine and methionine in MuLV RT and HIV-1 RT, respectively. Previous studies have shown that Tyr 222, the Y residue of the YXDD motif in MuLV RT, constitutes a major component of the fidelity center of the enzyme [Kaushik, N., Singh, K., Alluru, I., and Modak, M. J. (1999) Biochemistry 38, 2617-2627]. In this work, we present evidence that reverse transcriptases containing valine in the ""X"" position of the YXDD motif generally catalyze DNA synthesis with greater fidelity than those containing methionine or alanine. In the MuLV RT system, the two mutants V223M and V223A exhibited an overall reduced fidelity of DNA synthesis, specifically for RNA-templated reactions. Further analysis revealed that these mutants exhibit a higher efficiency of misinsertion on MS2 RNA than the wild-type enzyme for every mispair tested. However, unlike HIV-1 RT, the insensitivity of the wild-type MuLV RT to all four ddNTPs remained unchanged by mutation of V223 to Met or Ala. A 3D molecular model of the ternary complex of MuLV RT, template primer, and dNTP suggests that Val 223 along with its neighboring Tyr 222 stabilizes the substrate binding pocket via hydrophobic interactions with the dNTP substrate and template-primer.","['Kaushik, N', 'Chowdhury, K', 'Pandey, V N', 'Modak, M J']","['Kaushik N', 'Chowdhury K', 'Pandey VN', 'Modak MJ']","['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences and New Jersey Medical School, University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey, 185 South Orange Avenue, Newark, New Jersey 07103, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Biochemistry,Biochemistry,0370623,IM,"['Animals', 'DNA Replication', 'DNA, Viral', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*enzymology/genetics', 'Mice', 'RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase/chemistry/*genetics/metabolism', 'Templates, Genetic', 'Valine']",2000/05/23 09:00,2000/06/17 09:00,['2000/05/23 09:00'],"['2000/05/23 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/06/17 09:00 [medline]', '2000/05/23 09:00 [entrez]']","['bi992223b [pii]', '10.1021/bi992223b [doi]']",ppublish,Biochemistry. 2000 May 2;39(17):5155-65. doi: 10.1021/bi992223b.,"['0 (DNA, Viral)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase)', 'HG18B9YRS7 (Valine)']",,,,['GM36307/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

GT-rich TFOs were designed to target sequences located either upstream (myc1 and -2) or downstream (myc3 and -4) of the P2 promoter, which is the major c-myc promoter. Myc2, which was directed to a site immediately upstream of this promoter, inhibited c-myc expression and proliferation of CEM cells. The effects of this TFO were sequence- and target-specific, since control oligonucleotides and TFOs directed to other sites were less or not active. Myc2 was also effective in KG-1, HL-60, and Raji cells. In contrast, ST486 cells were more sensitive to myc3, which targets a sequence in intron 1 upstream of the P3 promoter, than myc2. As result of a chromosomal translocation, P3 is the active promoter in ST486 cells. This study demonstrates the activity and specificity of TFOs designed to act as repressors of c-myc gene expression in human leukemia and lymphoma cells. Our results suggest that this is a valid approach to selectively inhibit gene expression and cancer cell growth, and encourage further investigation of its potential applications in cancer therapy.","['Catapano, C V', 'McGuffie, E M', 'Pacheco, D', 'Carbone, G M']","['Catapano CV', 'McGuffie EM', 'Pacheco D', 'Carbone GM']","['Department of Experimental Oncology and Hollings Cancer Center, Medical University of South Carolina, Charleston, South Carolina 29425, USA.

Disease syndromes in humans caused by EBV reflect the cell types that EBV infects, being primarily of lymphoid or epithelial origin. The most notable lymphoid disease, infectious mononucleosis, is a self-limiting lymphoproliferative disease that occurs in normal adolescents on primary infection. Children are normally able to resolve primary EBV infection with few or no symptoms. By the age of 25 most individuals are EBV seropositive. EBV is associated with a variety of hematopoietic cancers such as African Burkitt's lymphoma, Hodgkin's, and adult T-cell leukemia. EBV-associated lymphoproliferative disease occurs in individuals with congenital or acquired cellular immune deficiencies. The two notable epithelial diseases associated with EBV infection are nasopharyngeal cancer, a malignancy endemic to southern China, and oral hairy leukoplakia, an epithelial hyperplasia of the lingual squamous epithelium in AIDS patients. Latent membrane protein 2 (LMP2) is expressed both in normal EBV latency and EBV-associated pathologies. LMP2 may regulate reactivation from latency by interfering with normal B-cell signal transduction processes and in doing so may also provide a survival signal that could be important for viral persistence. Current knowledge about the function of LMP2 is described, defining a new class of regulators of herpesvirus latency.","['Longnecker, R']",['Longnecker R'],"['Northwestern University Medical School, Chicago, IL 60611, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",United States,Adv Cancer Res,Advances in cancer research,0370416,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Amino Acid Motifs', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'B-Lymphocytes/*virology', 'Cell Line, Transformed', 'Cell Transformation, Viral', 'Epithelial Cells/*virology', 'Epstein-Barr Virus Infections/virology', 'Herpesvirus 4, Human/genetics/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Phosphorylation', 'Point Mutation', 'Proline/chemistry', 'Protein Conformation', 'Protein Processing, Post-Translational', 'Sequence Deletion', 'Serine/chemistry', 'Signal Transduction', 'Threonine/chemistry', 'Tumor Virus Infections/virology', 'Tyrosine/chemistry', 'Viral Matrix Proteins/chemistry/genetics/*physiology', 'Virus Latency/*physiology', 'src Homology Domains']",2000/05/20 09:00,2000/08/12 11:00,['2000/05/20 09:00'],"['2000/05/20 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/08/12 11:00 [medline]', '2000/05/20 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0065-230X(00)79006-3 [pii]', '10.1016/s0065-230x(00)79006-3 [doi]']",ppublish,Adv Cancer Res. 2000;79:175-200. doi: 10.1016/s0065-230x(00)79006-3.,"['0 (EBV-associated membrane antigen, Epstein-Barr virus)', '0 (Viral Matrix Proteins)', '2ZD004190S (Threonine)', '42HK56048U (Tyrosine)', '452VLY9402 (Serine)', '9DLQ4CIU6V (Proline)']",94,,,"['CA62234/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA73507/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'DE13127/DE/NIDCR NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This explains why low-grade B-cell neoplasms still fail to be cured with current approaches. It is becoming increasingly clear that the defective apoptosis of FL and B-CLL has to be ascribed not only to intrinsic defects of the neoplastic cells, but also to extrinsic factors that influence their behavior. Malignant B cells retain the capacity to respond to microenvironmental signals, but have devised a monothematic responsiveness. They have a specific sensitivity to anti-apoptotic signals that favor their survival, whereas they seem to have become insensitive to pro-apoptotic signals. Bystander, nontumoral cells play a fundamental (though not sufficient) role both in the onset and in the progression of these diseases. The survival of leukemic cells appears to be dependent on direct cell-cell contacts. The localization of malignant B cells in bone marrow or neoplastic follicles is not a passive adhesion phenomenon but a crucial step for their survival. Bidirectional malignant lymphocyte-nontumoral cell interactions may lead to the amplification of a microenvironment able to inhibit the apoptosis of neoplastic B cells. The pressure of antigenic selection and the role of the tumor necrosis factor receptor family through the functional survival signal provided by CD40 together with the crippled death signal exerted by CD95 are new prominent characters on the stage.","['Ghia, P', 'Caligaris-Cappio, F']","['Ghia P', 'Caligaris-Cappio F']","['Department of Biomedical Sciences and Human Oncology, University of Torino, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,Adv Cancer Res,Advances in cancer research,0370416,IM,"['Antigens, CD/physiology', 'Apoptosis/physiology', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'CD40 Antigens/physiology', 'CD40 Ligand', 'CD79 Antigens', 'Clonal Deletion', 'Cytokines/physiology', 'Dendritic Cells, Follicular/metabolism', 'Fas Ligand Protein', 'Germinal Center/physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*pathology', 'Leukemic Infiltration', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/*pathology', 'Lymphoma, Follicular/pathology', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/*pathology', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/physiology', 'Neoplasm Proteins/physiology', 'Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell/physiology', 'Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor/physiology', 'Stromal Cells/physiology', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/physiology', 'fas Receptor/physiology']",2000/05/20 09:00,2000/08/12 11:00,['2000/05/20 09:00'],"['2000/05/20 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/08/12 11:00 [medline]', '2000/05/20 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0065-230X(00)79005-1 [pii]', '10.1016/s0065-230x(00)79005-1 [doi]']",ppublish,Adv Cancer Res. 2000;79:157-73. doi: 10.1016/s0065-230x(00)79005-1.,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (CD40 Antigens)', '0 (CD79 Antigens)', '0 (CD79A protein, human)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (FASLG protein, human)', '0 (Fas Ligand Protein)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell)', '0 (Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '0 (fas Receptor)', '147205-72-9 (CD40 Ligand)']",84,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Population-based epidemiologic studies on osteoporosis in young persons do not exist. As a disease, osteoporosis among children and adolescents is rate, and since 1965 only 100 cases of idiopathic juvenile osteoprososis have been reported. When osteoporosis occurs in children, it is usually secondary to an underlying medical disorder (e.g., anorexia nervosa, leukemia) or to medications, but occasionally no identifiable primary cause can be detected. It may also be the result of a genetic disorder such as osteogenesis imperfecta. On the other hand, osteopenia in growing and young persons seems much commoner and needs further investigation. Adolescence is a period of increased calcium requirement, and girls with an underlying bone disease are at higher risk for bone demineralization. An additional point of interest is the changes in the geometry of bones through their continuous adaptation to simultaneous skeletal and muscular growth. Bones, through the mechanostat mechanism, adapt to mechanical loading by differentiating their geometry. A recent finding in this direction is that before and during the teenage years there is an environmental effect of physical activity and nutrition on hip geometry. Another important finding is an age-dependent increase in bone cross-sectional area and bone strength index in the absence of an increase in volumetric spongiosa bone density and cortical bone density. Girls, in comparison to boys, deposit more calcium in their bones during puberty, thus probably preparing their skeleton for the forthcoming events of pregnancy and lactation.","['Lyritis, G P', 'Schoenau, E', 'Skarantavos, G']","['Lyritis GP', 'Schoenau E', 'Skarantavos G']","['Laboratory for the Research of Musculoskeletal System, University of Athens, KAT Hospital, Greece.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Ann N Y Acad Sci,Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences,7506858,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Body Composition', 'Bone Density', 'Bone Development', '*Bone Diseases, Metabolic/diagnosis/etiology/physiopathology', 'Bone and Bones/metabolism', 'Calcium/metabolism', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Osteogenesis Imperfecta/diagnosis', 'Osteoporosis/diagnosis/metabolism']",2000/05/20 09:00,2000/06/03 09:00,['2000/05/20 09:00'],"['2000/05/20 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/06/03 09:00 [medline]', '2000/05/20 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1749-6632.2000.tb06252.x [doi]'],ppublish,Ann N Y Acad Sci. 2000;900:403-8. doi: 10.1111/j.1749-6632.2000.tb06252.x.,['SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

For example, apoptosis of developing sympathetic neurons may be induced in culture either by exposure to leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) or by deprivation of nerve growth factor. This study compared the cell death pathways activated in sympathetic neurons by these two different stimuli. Both types of cell death were developmentally regulated; both were maximal in the immediate postnatal period and disappeared over the next 2 weeks. Both types of cell death were reduced by genetic deletion of Bax or by virally mediated overexpression of Bcl-2. Similarly both were reduced by inhibition of caspase activity or by inhibition of Nedd-2 synthesis with antisense oligonucleotides. Finally, both involved activation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) signaling. Nedd-2 expression by sympathetic neurons declined in parallel with the developmental loss of LIF-mediated cell death, suggesting that downregulation of the caspase during development may underlie the loss of cytokine-mediated apoptosis. Treatment of sympathetic neurons with an antibody that blocks the function of the low-affinity neurotrophin receptor (p75(LNTR)) prevented LIF-induced cell death. Similarly genetic deletion of p75(LNTR) prevented apoptosis after LIF treatment. These observations suggest that concurrent p75(LNTR) signaling is necessary for LIF-induced cell death and that cytokine-mediated cell death and growth factor deprivation appear to activate the same intracellular pathways involving JNK signaling.","['Savitz, S I', 'Kessler, J A']","['Savitz SI', 'Kessler JA']","['Department of Neurology, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, New York 10461, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Neurosci,The Journal of neuroscience : the official journal of the Society for Neuroscience,8102140,IM,"['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing', 'Adenoviridae/genetics', 'Animals', 'Animals, Newborn', 'Apoptosis/*physiology', 'Caspase 2', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Genetic Vectors', 'Growth Inhibitors/*physiology', 'Immunohistochemistry', '*Interleukin-6', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Lymphokines/*physiology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Neurons/*physiology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics/physiology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/genetics/physiology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-jun/genetics/metabolism', 'Rats', 'Rats, Sprague-Dawley', 'Receptor, trkA/*genetics', 'Signal Transduction/*physiology', 'Superior Cervical Ganglion/cytology/physiology', 'Sympathetic Nervous System/cytology/*physiology', 'Trans-Activators/*physiology', 'Transcription Factors', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein']",2000/05/20 00:00,2000/06/17 00:00,['2000/05/20 00:00'],"['2000/05/20 00:00 [pubmed]', '2000/06/17 00:00 [medline]', '2000/05/20 00:00 [entrez]']",['20/11/4198 [pii]'],ppublish,J Neurosci. 2000 Jun 1;20(11):4198-205.,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (Bax protein, mouse)', '0 (Bax protein, rat)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-jun)', '0 (Psip1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Psip1 protein, rat)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor, trkA)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 2)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",,PMC6772618,,"['R01 20013/PHS HHS/United States', 'R01 20778/PHS HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Other associations (diabetes, tonsillectomy, autoimmune diseases) have been inconsistently reported. METHODS: The association between different haematolymphopoietic malignancies (lymphomas, myelomas and leukaemias) and the previous medical history has been studied in a population-based case-control investigation conducted in Italy, based on face to face interviews to 2669 cases and 1718 population controls (refusal rates 10% and 19%, respectively). Controls were a random sample of the general population. RESULTS: Previous findings were confirmed concerning the association between non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) and lupus erythematosus (odds ratio, OR=8.4; 95% CI 1. 6, 45), tuberculosis (OR=1.6; 1.05, 2.5) and hepatitis (1.8; 1.4, 2. 3). An association was found also between NHL and maternal (OR=2.8; 1.1, 6.9) or paternal tuberculosis (OR=1.7; 0.7, 3.9). Odds ratios of 4.0 (1.4, 11.8) and 4.4 (1.1, 6.6) were detected for the association between NHL and Hodgkin's disease, respectively, and previous infectious mononucleosis, but recall bias cannot be ruled out. No association was found with diabetes, tonsillectomy and adenoidectomy. An association with malaria at young age and ""low grade"" lymphatic malignancies is suggested. One interesting finding was the observation of four cases of poliomyelitis among NHL patients, one among Hodgkin's disease and one among myeloid leukaemia patients, compared with none among the controls (Fisher's exact test for NHL and Hodgkin's disease, p= 0.03, one tail). CONCLUSIONS: Some of these findings are confirmatory of previous evidence. Other observations, such as the putative role of the polio virus and of malaria are new. A unifying theory on the mechanisms by which previous medical history may increase the risk of haematolymphopoietic malignancies is still lacking.","['Vineis, P', 'Crosignani, P', 'Sacerdote, C', 'Fontana, A', 'Masala, G', 'Miligi, L', 'Nanni, O', 'Ramazzotti, V', 'Rodella, S', 'Stagnaro, E', 'Tumino, R', 'Vigano, C', 'Vindigni, C', 'Costantini, A S']","['Vineis P', 'Crosignani P', 'Sacerdote C', 'Fontana A', 'Masala G', 'Miligi L', 'Nanni O', 'Ramazzotti V', 'Rodella S', 'Stagnaro E', 'Tumino R', 'Vigano C', 'Vindigni C', 'Costantini AS']","['Unit of Cancer Epidemiology, Ospedale S Giovanni, Torino, Italy. paolo.vineis@UNITO.it']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,J Epidemiol Community Health,Journal of epidemiology and community health,7909766,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Female', 'Hodgkin Disease/epidemiology/*etiology', 'Humans', 'Infections/complications', 'Infectious Mononucleosis/complications', 'Italy/epidemiology', 'Leukemia/epidemiology/*etiology', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/epidemiology/*etiology', 'Malaria/complications', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Odds Ratio', 'Risk Factors', 'Surveys and Questionnaires']",2000/05/20 09:00,2000/07/25 11:00,['2000/05/20 09:00'],"['2000/05/20 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/07/25 11:00 [medline]', '2000/05/20 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1136/jech.54.6.431 [doi]'],ppublish,J Epidemiol Community Health. 2000 Jun;54(6):431-6. doi: 10.1136/jech.54.6.431.,,,PMC1731690,,['CA51086/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A prospective study.,417-20,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the prevalence of antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA) and rheumatic manifestations associated with chronic haematological malignancies. METHODS: Two groups of patients were prospectively studied (group I: 60 patients with myelodysplastic syndromes and group II: 140 patients with lymphoid malignancies) for clinical 'immune' manifestations and ANCA. RESULTS: In the myelodysplastic group, six patients had ANCA-negative systemic medium-size vasculitis, one had systemic vasculitis with cytoplasmic ANCA, one relapsing polychondritis, one giant cell arteritis, one polymyalgia rheumatica, one polyarthritis and two fasciitis. In group II, two patients had ANCA-negative systemic vasculitis, two had leucocytoclastic vasculitis associated with tuberculosis, two had polyarthritis, one polymyalgia rheumatica and one giant cell arteritis. Six sera were ANCA-positive with perinuclear pattern in four cases, atypical pattern in one and cytoplasmic pattern in one. Two sera had anti-myeloperoxidase (MPO) specificity, and others had no known specificity; none had anti-proteinase 3 (PR3) specificity. Global prevalence of ANCA in our cohort was 3%, similar to the French general population. CONCLUSION: Polyarteritis nodosa-type systemic vasculitis and polymyalgia rheumatica were the most frequent findings (18%) in myelodysplastic syndromes and particularly in chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia. ANCA were not helpful for the diagnosis of vasculitis. Vasculitis associated with infection, in particular tuberculosis, must be ruled out.","['Hamidou, M A', 'Derenne, S', 'Audrain, M A', 'Berthelot, J M', 'Boumalassa, A', 'Grolleau, J Y']","['Hamidou MA', 'Derenne S', 'Audrain MA', 'Berthelot JM', 'Boumalassa A', 'Grolleau JY']","['Department of Internal Medicine, University Hospital, Hotel-Dieu, 44093 Nantes, France.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Rheumatology (Oxford),"Rheumatology (Oxford, England)",100883501,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antibodies, Antineutrophil Cytoplasmic/*analysis/immunology', 'Female', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*complications/immunology', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/complications', 'Polymyalgia Rheumatica/etiology', 'Prevalence', 'Prospective Studies', 'Rheumatic Diseases/epidemiology/*etiology', 'Vasculitis/epidemiology/*etiology']",2000/05/19 09:00,2000/07/06 11:00,['2000/05/19 09:00'],"['2000/05/19 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/07/06 11:00 [medline]', '2000/05/19 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/rheumatology/39.4.417 [doi]'],ppublish,Rheumatology (Oxford). 2000 Apr;39(4):417-20. doi: 10.1093/rheumatology/39.4.417.,"['0 (Antibodies, Antineutrophil Cytoplasmic)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Fifty caucasoid FS patients, and 55 patients with LGL syndrome, of whom 26 had arthritis and 29 did not, were studied. Complete HLA class I and HLA-DR typing including, where relevant, DRB1*04 subtyping was carried out by molecular methods. Comparison was made with 78 unselected healthy caucasoid controls and a further 29 DRB1*0401+ individuals. RESULTS: A significant association was found between HLA-A*02 and FS [odds ratio (OR) 3.9, 95% confidence interval (95% CI) 1.8-8.4, P = 0.0004]. At the B locus, there was an association between B*44 and LGL with arthritis [OR 3.5 (1.3-9.2), P = 0.01]. For HLA-Cw*0501, there was an association with FS [OR 4 (1. 7-9.2) P = 0.0008]. For both FS and LGL with arthritis, the extended haplotype HLA-A*02;B*44;Cw*0501;DRB1*0401 was significantly associated [OR 9.5 (2.6-35), P = 0.0001; OR 4.6 (1-22.4), P = 0.05, respectively]. There was no association between HLA class I or II and LGL without arthritis. All the allelic and haplotypic associations were lost on comparison with HLA-DRB1*0401+ controls. The strongest HLA association was with HLA-DRB1*0401 for FS [OR 27.9 (10.3-75.5), P = 10(-13)], and LGL with arthritis [OR 35.4 (9.6-131. 3), P = 10(-10)]. CONCLUSIONS: The major histocompatibility locus (MHC) associations with FS reported here are due to linkage disequilibrium with HLA-DRB1*0401. LGL syndrome with arthritis shows identical class II associations with FS, although there may be subtle immunogenetic differences between the two in the class I region. One of the extended haplotypes reported in a number of studies for FS and rheumatoid arthritis (summarized as HLA-A*02;Cw*0501; B*44;TNFb5;TNFa6;TNFd4;C4A*3;C4BQ*0;DRB1*0 401;DQB1*0301) is likely to be attributable to strong primary association with HLA-DRB1*0401, rather than to epistatic interaction between these loci.","['Coakley, G', 'Brooks, D', 'Iqbal, M', 'Kondeatis, E', 'Vaughan, R', 'Loughran, T P Jr', 'Panayi, G S', 'Lanchbury, J S']","['Coakley G', 'Brooks D', 'Iqbal M', 'Kondeatis E', 'Vaughan R', 'Loughran TP Jr', 'Panayi GS', 'Lanchbury JS']","[""Department of Rheumatology, 5th Floor, Thomas Guy House, Guy's, King's and St Thomas' School of Medicine, Guy's Hospital, London SE1 9RT, UK.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Rheumatology (Oxford),"Rheumatology (Oxford, England)",100883501,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Alleles', 'Arthritis, Rheumatoid/*complications/genetics', 'Felty Syndrome/*genetics/*immunology', 'Female', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'HLA-DR Antigens/*genetics', 'HLA-DRB1 Chains', 'Haplotypes', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/genetics', 'Linkage Disequilibrium', 'Major Histocompatibility Complex/*genetics/immunology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Syndrome']",2000/05/19 09:00,2000/07/06 11:00,['2000/05/19 09:00'],"['2000/05/19 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/07/06 11:00 [medline]', '2000/05/19 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/rheumatology/39.4.393 [doi]'],ppublish,Rheumatology (Oxford). 2000 Apr;39(4):393-8. doi: 10.1093/rheumatology/39.4.393.,"['0 (HLA-DR Antigens)', '0 (HLA-DRB1 Chains)', '0 (HLA-DRB1*04:01 antigen)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In contrast, both the latent form of PAI-1 and the stable variant of PAI-1 inactivated by a specific neutralizing monoclonal antibody, or the stable variant of PAI-1 in a complex with recombinant urokinase did not inhibit apoptosis. This indicated that the inhibitory activity of PAI-1 was required for its anti-apoptotic effect but the urokinase-type plasminogen activator receptor was not involved.

In addition, a similar potency of bioactivities was expressed by 6-(1-propyloxyiminoalkyl)-DMNQ derivatives, propylation products of the oximes.","['Song, G Y', 'Kim, Y', 'You, Y J', 'Cho, H', 'Kim, S H', 'Sok, D E', 'Ahn, B Z']","['Song GY', 'Kim Y', 'You YJ', 'Cho H', 'Kim SH', 'Sok DE', 'Ahn BZ']","['College of Pharmacy, Chungnam National University, Taejon, Korea.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Arch Pharm (Weinheim),Archiv der Pharmazie,0330167,IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/chemical synthesis/chemistry/pharmacology', 'Inhibitory Concentration 50', 'Leukemia L1210', 'Mice', 'Naphthoquinones/chemical synthesis/*chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Topoisomerase I Inhibitors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects']",2000/05/19 09:00,2000/06/24 11:00,['2000/05/19 09:00'],"['2000/05/19 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/06/24 11:00 [medline]', '2000/05/19 09:00 [entrez]']","['10.1002/(SICI)1521-4184(20004)333:4<87::AID-ARDP87>3.0.CO;2-1 [pii]', '10.1002/(sici)1521-4184(20004)333:4<87::aid-ardp87>3.0.co;2-1 [doi]']",ppublish,Arch Pharm (Weinheim). 2000 Apr;333(4):87-92. doi: 10.1002/(sici)1521-4184(20004)333:4<87::aid-ardp87>3.0.co;2-1.,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Naphthoquinones)', '0 (Topoisomerase I Inhibitors)', '475-38-7 (naphthazarin)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

G-361 cells utilize two additional integrins, alpha(9)beta(1) and alpha(5)beta(1) to adhere to tTG. Furthermore, blood coagulation factor XIII (FXIII), another member of the transglutaminase family that is highly homologous to tTG, and propolypeptide of von Willebrand factor (pp-vWF) also promoted cell adhesion through alpha(9)beta(1) or alpha(4)beta(1) in G-361 or MOLT-3 cells, respectively. In the case of pp-vWF, alpha(9)beta(1) and alpha(4)beta(1) both bind to the same site, comprised of 15 amino acid residues and designated T2-15. Moreover, SW480 human colon cancer cells stably transfected to express alpha(9)beta(1), but not mock transfectants, adhered to tTG, FXIII, pp-vWF, and T2-15/bovine serum albumin conjugate. These data identify tTG, FXIII, and pp-vWF as shared ligands for the integrins alpha(9)beta(1) and alpha(4)beta(1). This report is the first to unambiguously show that these two integrins share the same cell adhesion site within one protein and provides strong support for classifying alpha(9)beta(1-) and alpha(4)-integrins as functionally related members of an integrin subfamily.","['Takahashi, H', 'Isobe, T', 'Horibe, S', 'Takagi, J', 'Yokosaki, Y', 'Sheppard, D', 'Saito, Y']","['Takahashi H', 'Isobe T', 'Horibe S', 'Takagi J', 'Yokosaki Y', 'Sheppard D', 'Saito Y']","['Department of Biological Sciences, Graduate School of Bioscience and Biotechnology, Tokyo Institute of Technology, 4259 Nagatsuta-cho, Midori-ku, Yokohama 226-8501, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Antigens, CD/metabolism', 'Cell Adhesion', 'Colonic Neoplasms', 'Factor XIII/*metabolism', 'GTP-Binding Proteins/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Integrin alpha4beta1', 'Integrin alpha5', 'Integrins/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid', 'Ligands', 'Melanoma/metabolism', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Glutamine gamma Glutamyltransferase 2', 'Protein Precursors/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Lymphocyte Homing/*metabolism', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid', 'Transglutaminases/*metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'von Willebrand Factor/*metabolism']",2000/05/19 09:00,2000/09/09 11:01,['2000/05/19 09:00'],"['2000/05/19 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/09/09 11:01 [medline]', '2000/05/19 09:00 [entrez]']","['10.1074/jbc.M003526200 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(19)66015-1 [pii]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2000 Aug 4;275(31):23589-95. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M003526200.,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Integrin alpha4beta1)', '0 (Integrin alpha5)', '0 (Integrins)', '0 (Ligands)', '0 (Protein Precursors)', '0 (Receptors, Lymphocyte Homing)', '0 (integrin alpha 9 beta 1)', '0 (von Willebrand Factor)', '0 (von Willebrand factor propolypeptide)', '9013-56-3 (Factor XIII)', 'EC 2.3.2.13 (Protein Glutamine gamma Glutamyltransferase 2)', 'EC 2.3.2.13 (Transglutaminases)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (GTP-Binding Proteins)']",,,,['HL/AI33259/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the present study, we show that the expression of the EEN gene-family members is differentially regulated. Multiple-spliced variants were identified for EEN-B2. In the brain, EEN-B1 and EEN-B2 mRNA are preferentially expressed in the cerebellar Purkinje and granule cells, dentate gyrus cells, hippocampal pyramidal neurons and cerebral granule cells. The expression patterns of EEN-B1 and EEN-B2 mRNA in the brain overlap with those of dynamin-I/III, synaptojanin-I and huntingtin, whereas the ubiquitous expression of EEN is consistent with that of dynamin-II. In testes, members of the EEN family are co-expressed with testis-type dynamin and huntingtin in Sertoli cells and germ cells respectively. Our results on the overlapping expression patterns are consistent with the proposed interaction of EEN family members with dynamin, synaptojanin and huntingtin protein in vivo. Although all three EEN family members bind to dynamin and synaptojanin, EEN-B1 has the highest affinity for binding, followed by EEN and EEN-B2. We also demonstrate that amphiphysin, a major synaptojanin-binding protein in brain, can compete with the EEN family for binding to synaptojanin and dynamin. We propose that recruitment of the EEN family by dynamin/synaptojanin to clathrin-coated pits can be regulated by amphiphysin.","['So, C W', 'Sham, M H', 'Chew, S L', 'Cheung, N', 'So, C K', 'Chung, S K', 'Caldas, C', 'Wiedemann, L M', 'Chan, L C']","['So CW', 'Sham MH', 'Chew SL', 'Cheung N', 'So CK', 'Chung SK', 'Caldas C', 'Wiedemann LM', 'Chan LC']","[""Department of Pathology, The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples' Republic of China. cwso@stanford.edu""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Biochem J,The Biochemical journal,2984726R,IM,"['Alternative Splicing', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Brain/*metabolism', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Dynamin I', 'Dynamin III', 'Dynamins', 'Embryonic and Fetal Development', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/metabolism', 'GTP Phosphohydrolases/*metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental', 'Genetic Variation', 'Humans', 'Huntingtin Protein', 'Huntington Disease/genetics', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Multigene Family', 'Nerve Tissue Proteins/*metabolism', 'Neurons/metabolism', 'Nuclear Proteins/*metabolism', 'Phosphoric Monoester Hydrolases/*metabolism', 'Protein Binding', 'Proteins/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/metabolism', 'Transcription, Genetic']",2000/05/19 09:00,2000/08/06 11:00,['2000/05/19 09:00'],"['2000/05/19 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/08/06 11:00 [medline]', '2000/05/19 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Biochem J. 2000 Jun 1;348 Pt 2:447-58.,"['0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (HTT protein, human)', '0 (Htt protein, mouse)', '0 (Huntingtin Protein)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Nerve Tissue Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (SH3GL1 protein, human)', 'EC 3.1.3.- (synaptojanin)', 'EC 3.1.3.2 (Phosphoric Monoester Hydrolases)', 'EC 3.5.1.50 (Dynamin I)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (GTP Phosphohydrolases)', 'EC 3.6.5.5 (Dynamin III)', 'EC 3.6.5.5 (Dynamins)']",,PMC1221085,,,,,,,,"['GENBANK/AF036268', 'GENBANK/AF036269', 'GENBANK/AF036270', 'GENBANK/AF036271', 'GENBANK/AF036272']",,,,,,,,,,

One type of CD4+ lymphocyte, T helper 1 (Th1), produces interferon (IFN)-gamma and tumour necrosis factor beta, a second type (Th2) produces interleukin (IL)-4 and IL-5 and a third type (Th0) produces both Th1 and Th2 cytokines. The apparent paradox that embryos are not rejected by the maternal immune system despite the presence of paternal MHC histocompatibility antigens has been explained in mice by a Th2 switch at the level of the materno-fetal interface. We showed that some hormones enhanced during pregnancy can affect the development of Th1 and Th2 responses. Indeed, we found that progesterone promotes the production of IL-4 and IL-5, whereas relaxin promotes the production of IFN-gamma by T-cells. In addition, we showed that leukaemia inhibitory factor (LIF), which is essential for embryo implantation, associates with Th2 cells and is upregulated by IL-4 and progesterone. We also showed that LIF is down-regulated by Th1 inducers [IL-12, IFN-gamma and IFN-alpha]. Furthermore, we found a decreased production of LIF, IL-4 and IL-10 by decidual T-cells in women with unexplained recurrent abortions in comparison with women with normal gestation at the moment of voluntary abortion. The decreased production of LIF, IL-4 and IL-10 was not found in peripheral-blood T-cells. These results suggest that the local production of LIF and/or Th2 cytokines may contribute to the maintenance of pregnancy.","['Piccinni, M P', 'Maggi, E', 'Romagnani, S']","['Piccinni MP', 'Maggi E', 'Romagnani S']","['Immunoallergology and Diseases of Respiratory Apparatus, Department of Internal Medicine, University of Florence, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Biochem Soc Trans,Biochemical Society transactions,7506897,IM,"['Abortion, Spontaneous/metabolism', 'Cytokines/*physiology', 'Female', 'Growth Inhibitors/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-10/biosynthesis', 'Interleukin-4/biosynthesis', '*Interleukin-6', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Lymphokines/metabolism', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Maintenance/*physiology', 'T-Lymphocytes/*physiology', 'Th1 Cells/metabolism', 'Th2 Cells/metabolism']",2000/05/18 09:00,2000/08/19 11:00,['2000/05/18 09:00'],"['2000/05/18 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/08/19 11:00 [medline]', '2000/05/18 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1042/bst0280212 [doi]'],ppublish,Biochem Soc Trans. 2000 Feb;28(2):212-5. doi: 10.1042/bst0280212.,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '130068-27-8 (Interleukin-10)', '207137-56-2 (Interleukin-4)']",18,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We showed previously that this graft-versus-leukemia (GvL) effect is dependent on synergistic interactions of transferred CD4+ and CD8+ T cells with host sialoadhesin (SER)-positive macrophages. We now show that the CD40-CD40L (CD154) interaction is involved in the induction of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) expression during adoptive immunotherapy (ADI). We demonstrate that during ADI, the level of CD40 expression in the liver becomes significantly augmented in comparison to livers of tumor-bearing, untreated animals. CD40 expression is found mostly on SER+ macrophages and to a lesser extent on dendritic cells (DCs). In GvL animals, more SER+ macrophages express iNOS than untreated animals. iNOS expressing cells are found in close proximity to apoptotic cells, at early time points of the therapy in areas of metastasis, and at late stages around portal veins, where CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocytes form clusters with SER+ macrophages. Blocking of CD40L in vivo at days 5 and 20, when all iNOS+ cells express CD40, leads to significantly reduced CD40 and iNOS expression as well as to a marked inhibition of the therapeutic effect. These data provide functional and in situ evidence that the increased CD40 and iNOS expression observed during ADI contribute to the eradication of liver metastases and to the clearance of donor lymphocytes from the liver.","['Muerkoster, S', 'Laman, J D', 'Rocha, M', 'Umansky, V', 'Schirrmacher, V']","['Muerkoster S', 'Laman JD', 'Rocha M', 'Umansky V', 'Schirrmacher V']","['Division of Cellular Immunology, Tumor Immunology Program, German Cancer Research Center, Heidelberg. s.mueerkoester@dkfz-heidelberg.de']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/therapeutic use', 'Antigen-Presenting Cells/chemistry/cytology', 'Apoptosis', 'CD40 Antigens/*metabolism', 'CD40 Ligand', 'Cell Count', 'Down-Regulation', '*Graft vs Leukemia Effect', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Immunotherapy, Adoptive', 'Liver/chemistry/immunology/pathology', 'Macrophages/chemistry/cytology/enzymology', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/immunology/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred DBA', 'Neoplasms, Experimental/immunology/metabolism/therapy', 'Nitric Oxide/*metabolism', 'Nitric Oxide Synthase/metabolism', 'Nitric Oxide Synthase Type II', 'Protein Binding', 'Receptors, Immunologic/metabolism', 'Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 1']",2000/05/18 09:00,2000/09/02 11:01,['2000/05/18 09:00'],"['2000/05/18 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/09/02 11:01 [medline]', '2000/05/18 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2000 May;6(5):1988-96.,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (CD40 Antigens)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Receptors, Immunologic)', '0 (Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 1)', '0 (Siglec1 protein, mouse)', '147205-72-9 (CD40 Ligand)', '31C4KY9ESH (Nitric Oxide)', 'EC 1.14.13.39 (Nitric Oxide Synthase)', 'EC 1.14.13.39 (Nitric Oxide Synthase Type II)', 'EC 1.14.13.39 (Nos2 protein, mouse)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We used this enzyme inhibitor to characterize the biological effects of BCR-ABL in primary cells and two growth factor-dependent BCR-ABL-transfected cell lines. The effect of CGP 57148 on primary cells is dependent on the stage of differentiation. The growth of maturing chronic myeloid leukemia cells is independent of BCR-ABL in the presence of growth factors. However, the proliferation of leukemic immature cobblestone-forming area cells is almost completely blocked after the inhibition of the BCR-ABL kinase. In the BCR-ABL-transfected cell lines, M07/ p210 and Ba/F3/p185, CGP 57148 induces apoptosis by releasing cytochrome c, activating caspase 3, and cleavage of PARP. No alteration of the expression level of the apoptosis regulator BCL-2 was observed. In contrast, BCL-X was down-regulated after exposure to CGP 57148. Inhibitors of signal transduction proteins such as PI-3 kinase, mitogen-activated protein/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase, and Janus-activated kinase 2 pathways were not capable of a comparable down-regulation of BCL-X. The Fas/Fas ligand system was not involved either in the induction of apoptosis by CGP 57148. We conclude that the inhibition of the BCR-ABL kinase by CGP 57148 (a) preferentially inhibits the growth of immature leukemic precursor cells, (b) efficiently reverts the antiapoptotic effects of BCR-ABL by down-regulation of BCL-X, and (c) is more effective than the inhibition of the downstream signal transduction pathways of PI-3 kinase, mitogen-activated protein/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase, and Janus-activated kinase 2.","['Oetzel, C', 'Jonuleit, T', 'Gotz, A', 'van der Kuip, H', 'Michels, H', 'Duyster, J', 'Hallek, M', 'Aulitzky, W E']","['Oetzel C', 'Jonuleit T', 'Gotz A', 'van der Kuip H', 'Michels H', 'Duyster J', 'Hallek M', 'Aulitzky WE']","['2nd Department of Internal Medicine for Oncology, Hematology and Immunology, Robert Bosch Hospital, Stuttgart, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Benzamides', 'Caspase 3', 'Caspases/drug effects/metabolism', 'Cell Count/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Chromones/pharmacology', 'Cytochrome c Group/drug effects/metabolism', 'Cytosol/drug effects/metabolism', 'Down-Regulation', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Fas Ligand Protein', 'Flavonoids/pharmacology', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/drug therapy/enzymology/pathology', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/metabolism', 'Morpholines/pharmacology', 'Piperazines/*pharmacology', 'Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases/metabolism', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Pyrimidines/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tyrphostins/pharmacology', 'bcl-X Protein', 'fas Receptor/metabolism']",2000/05/18 09:00,2000/09/02 11:01,['2000/05/18 09:00'],"['2000/05/18 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/09/02 11:01 [medline]', '2000/05/18 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2000 May;6(5):1958-68.,"['0 (BCL2L1 protein, human)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Chromones)', '0 (Cytochrome c Group)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (FASLG protein, human)', '0 (Fas Ligand Protein)', '0 (Flavonoids)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Morpholines)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Tyrphostins)', '0 (alpha-cyano-(3,4-dihydroxy)-N-benzylcinnamide)', '0 (bcl-X Protein)', '0 (fas Receptor)', '31M2U1DVID (2-(4-morpholinyl)-8-phenyl-4H-1-benzopyran-4-one)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.4.2.30 (Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'SJE1IO5E3I (2-(2-amino-3-methoxyphenyl)-4H-1-benzopyran-4-one)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It has been shown that peptides derived from the junctional region of this oncogenic fusion protein can be recognized by human T-lymphocytes obtained from normal donors. In this study, we investigated the immunogenicity in patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) of a 17 mer b3/a2 Bcr/abl peptide (B/A1), which was shown to induce proliferative responses in lymphocytes from normal donors. A total of 56 CML patients in chronic phase were studied. Twenty-two patients were studied at diagnosis without any treatment (group I). Fourteen patients were receiving IFN (group II), 14 patients were being treated with hydroxyurea (group III), and 6 patients were on different regimens (group IV). Patients were initially assessed for general immunological competence using both in vivo and in vitro assays. Patients were also selected for the expression of HLA-DR0401, the HLA specificity known to present peptide B/A1 to CD4 lymphocytes. With the exception of the six patients in group IV, the results of all these assays (in vitro phytohemagglutinin/tetanus toxoid responses, in vivo skin reaction to ubiquitous antigens) in CML patients did not significantly differ from those obtained in normal donors, thus excluding the presence of generalized immunosuppression. Eight patients with HLA-DR0401 and a b3/a2 type of fusion were identified and further studied. In these eight patients dendritic cells were obtained from adherent peripheral blood mononuclear cells and used to stimulate CD4 lymphocytes. No patient developed a specific response to the bcr/abl peptide, although patients' lymphocytes proliferated in response to a promiscuous tetanus toxoid peptide in all but one case. In contrast, response to the bcr/abl peptide was observed in seven of eight HLA-DR0401 healthy donors tested. These data suggest that immunocompetent, HLA-DR0401+ CML patients are unable to respond to peptide B/A1, at difference from healthy donors. The implication of these results for the immunotherapy of CML is discussed.","['Bertazzoli, C', 'Marchesi, E', 'Passoni, L', 'Barni, R', 'Ravagnani, F', 'Lombardo, C', 'Corneo, G M', 'Pioltelli, P', 'Pogliani, E', 'Gambacorti-Passerini, C']","['Bertazzoli C', 'Marchesi E', 'Passoni L', 'Barni R', 'Ravagnani F', 'Lombardo C', 'Corneo GM', 'Pioltelli P', 'Pogliani E', 'Gambacorti-Passerini C']","['Department of Experimental Oncology, Istituto Nazionale Tumori, Milan, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,IM,"['Cell Division/drug effects', 'Dendritic Cells/cytology/drug effects/immunology', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*immunology/pharmacology', 'Histocompatibility Testing', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/blood/*immunology', 'Lymphocytes/cytology/drug effects/*immunology', 'Phytohemagglutinins/pharmacology', 'Tetanus Toxoid/pharmacology']",2000/05/18 09:00,2000/09/02 11:01,['2000/05/18 09:00'],"['2000/05/18 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/09/02 11:01 [medline]', '2000/05/18 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2000 May;6(5):1931-5.,"['0 (Phytohemagglutinins)', '0 (Tetanus Toxoid)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In cultured cells, Ras is activated by various hematopoietic cytokines and growth factors, but the activation state of Ras in peripheral WBCs and bone marrow cells has not been studied nor has Ras activation been assessed in cells from patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Using an enzyme-based method, we assessed Ras activation in peripheral WBCs, lymphocytes, and bone marrow cells from normal subjects and from children with T-cell ALL (T-ALL) and B-lineage ALL (B-ALL). In normal subjects, we found mean Ras activations of 14.3, 12.5, and 17.2% for peripheral blood WBCs, lymphocytes, and bone marrow cells, respectively. All three of these values are higher than we have found in other normal human cells, compatible with constitutive activation of Ras by cytokines and growth factors present in serum and bone marrow. In 9 of 18 children with T-ALL, Ras activation exceeded two SDs above the mean of the corresponding cells from normal subjects, whereas in none of 11 patients with B-ALL did Ras show increased activation; activating genetic mutations in ras occur in less than 10% of ALL patients. Thus, Ras is relatively activated in peripheral blood WBCs, lymphocytes, and bone marrow cells compared with other normal human cells, and Ras is activated frequently in T-ALL but not in B-ALL. Increased Ras activation in T-ALL compared with B-ALL may contribute to the more aggressive nature of the former disease.","['von Lintig, F C', 'Huvar, I', 'Law, P', 'Diccianni, M B', 'Yu, A L', 'Boss, G R']","['von Lintig FC', 'Huvar I', 'Law P', 'Diccianni MB', 'Yu AL', 'Boss GR']","['Department of Medicine, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla 92093-0652, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Blood Cells/*metabolism', 'Bone Marrow Cells/metabolism', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/blood/metabolism', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/blood/metabolism', 'Leukocytes/metabolism', 'Lymphocytes/metabolism', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/blood/*metabolism', 'ras Proteins/*metabolism']",2000/05/18 09:00,2000/09/02 11:01,['2000/05/18 09:00'],"['2000/05/18 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/09/02 11:01 [medline]', '2000/05/18 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2000 May;6(5):1804-10.,['EC 3.6.5.2 (ras Proteins)'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

XIAP and cIAP1 were expressed in most cancer lines analyzed, with substantial variability in their relative levels. In contrast, NAIP mRNA was not detectable, and cIAP2 was found at the mRNA and protein levels in only 34 (56%) and 5 (8%) of the 60 tumor cell lines analyzed, respectively. Interestingly, XIAP, cIAP1, and cIAP2 mRNA levels did not correlate with protein levels in the tumor lines, indicating posttranscriptional regulation of expression. High levels of XIAP protein in tumor cell lines were unexpectedly correlated with sensitivity to some anticancer drugs, particularly cytarabine and other nucleosides, whereas higher levels of cIAP1 protein levels were associated with resistance to several anticancer drugs. The relevance of XIAP to in vivo responses to cytarabine was explored in AML, making correlations with patient outcome (n = 78). Patients with lower levels of XIAP protein had significantly longer survival (median, 133 versus 52.5 weeks; P = 0.05) and a tendency toward longer remission duration (median, 87 versus 52.5 weeks; P = 0.13) than those with higher levels of XIAP. Altogether, these findings show that IAPs are widely but differentially expressed in human cancers and leukemias and suggest that higher XIAP protein levels may have adverse prognostic significance for patients with AML.","['Tamm, I', 'Kornblau, S M', 'Segall, H', 'Krajewski, S', 'Welsh, K', 'Kitada, S', 'Scudiero, D A', 'Tudor, G', 'Qui, Y H', 'Monks, A', 'Andreeff, M', 'Reed, J C']","['Tamm I', 'Kornblau SM', 'Segall H', 'Krajewski S', 'Welsh K', 'Kitada S', 'Scudiero DA', 'Tudor G', 'Qui YH', 'Monks A', 'Andreeff M', 'Reed JC']","['The Burnham Institute, La Jolla, California 92037, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,IM,"['Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Immunoblotting', 'Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/metabolism/*pathology', 'Neoplasms/genetics/metabolism/*pathology', 'Prognosis', 'Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'Survival Analysis', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/cytology/drug effects/metabolism', 'Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases', 'X-Linked Inhibitor of Apoptosis Protein']",2000/05/18 09:00,2000/09/02 11:01,['2000/05/18 09:00'],"['2000/05/18 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/09/02 11:01 [medline]', '2000/05/18 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2000 May;6(5):1796-803.,"['0 (Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (X-Linked Inhibitor of Apoptosis Protein)', '0 (XIAP protein, human)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (BIRC2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases)']",,,,"['5P01CA69381-04/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'AG 15402/AG/NIA NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-55164-08/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Treatment with IFN-alpha has proven to be an effective therapy, inducing cytogenetic remission in CML patients. However, it is unknown whether IFN-alpha can restore normal immune function for patients who achieve a complete cytogenetic remission. To address this question, we used a method of intracellular staining and flow cytometric analysis to ascribe the syntheses of Th1 or Th2 cytokines to T-cell subsets of patients in chronic, in accelerated, and in blast crisis phases as well as patients who had achieved a complete cytogenetic remission with IFN-alpha. We assessed the cytoplasmic synthesis of cytokine in phorbol ester (phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate)-activated CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell subsets of 81 patients with various stages of CML and 21 normal controls. The percentages of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells from patients in chronic, in accelerated, and in blast crisis phases that synthesized Th1 cytokines interleukin (IL)-2, IFN-gamma, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha were significantly lower than those of remission patients and normal controls. Conversely, the percentages of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells of patients in chronic, in accelerated, and in blast crisis phases of CML preferentially synthesized the Th2 cytokine IL-10.

The Human T-cell Leukemia Virus Type I (HTLV-I) is the etiological agent of Adult T-cell Leukemia/Lymphoma (ATLL). A previous report suggested that Tax, the viral transactivator, is able to suppress the transactivation potential of c-Myb protein by competing for recruitment of CBP. We tested whether such a competition could affect transcription from the c-Myb promoter in Tax expressing T-cells. Using several c-Myb promoter reporter constructs carrying mutations in various regions, we demonstrate that Tax suppression of c-Myb transactivation results in transrepression of the c-Myb promoter through the Myb responsive elements in Jurkat T-cells. The ability of Tax mutants M22, M47 and V89A to interact with the full-length CBP and p300 proteins in vitro, and their ability to repress the c-Myb promoter, was then evaluated. Although both M47 and M22 bind to CBP and p300 to a similar extent, only M47 was able to repress the c-Myb promoter, suggesting that competition for CBP/p300 binding was not the mechanism underlying Tax's effect. This concept was further supported by the fact that the Tax mutant V89A transrepresses the c-Myb promoter efficiently in spite of an impaired binding to CBP and p300. Therefore, Tax-mediated repression of the c-Myb promoter appears to be independent from a direct competition between c-Myb and Tax for recruitment of CBP/p300. Interestingly, a decreased transcription from the endogenous c-Myb promoter was observed in several HTLV-I transformed T-cell lines. Finally, the ability of Tax to directly repress the endogenous c-Myb promoter was demonstrated in a Jurkat cell line stably transfected with a tax gene driven by a cadmium-inducible promoter.","['Nicot, C', 'Mahieux, R', 'Opavsky, R', 'Cereseto, A', 'Wolff, L', 'Brady, J N', 'Franchini, G']","['Nicot C', 'Mahieux R', 'Opavsky R', 'Cereseto A', 'Wolff L', 'Brady JN', 'Franchini G']","['Basic Research Laboratory, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, Maryland 20814, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,IM,"['CREB-Binding Protein', 'Cell Line, Transformed', 'Cell Transformation, Viral', 'Cyclic AMP Response Element-Binding Protein/*metabolism', 'Gene Products, tax/genetics/*metabolism', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*chemistry', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells/pathology/virology', 'Mutation', 'Nuclear Proteins/*metabolism', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Proto-Oncogene Mas', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myb/*genetics/metabolism', 'Response Elements', 'Trans-Activators/*metabolism', 'Transcription, Genetic']",2000/05/18 09:00,2000/06/10 09:00,['2000/05/18 09:00'],"['2000/05/18 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/06/10 09:00 [medline]', '2000/05/18 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.onc.1203536 [doi]'],ppublish,Oncogene. 2000 Apr 20;19(17):2155-64. doi: 10.1038/sj.onc.1203536.,"['0 (Cyclic AMP Response Element-Binding Protein)', '0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (MAS1 protein, human)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Mas)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myb)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', 'EC 2.3.1.48 (CREB-Binding Protein)', 'EC 2.3.1.48 (CREBBP protein, human)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here we show that integration at Evi27 occurs in a CpG island approximately 6 kb upstream from a novel gene (designated Evii27) with homology to the IL17 receptor (Il17r) and that proviral integrations result in increased expression of the Evi27 protein on the cell surface. The human EVI27 homolog was also cloned and mapped to chromosome 3p21. Multiple Evi27 isoforms were detected at the RNA and protein level in both human and mouse, indicating that Evi27 expression is complex. Some of the isoforms are shown to likely represent secreted soluble forms of the protein produced by intron incorporation or by proteolytic cleavage. In the mouse, highest Evi27 expression occurs in liver and testes with lower expression in kidney and lung. In humans, EVI27 is expressed at high levels in the kidney, with moderate levels in the liver, brain, and testes. Within hematopoietic cells, Evi27 expression is restricted. Northern and Western analysis showed that Evi27 is expressed in selected T-cell, B-cell and myeloid cell lines. These results suggest that Evi27 expression is tightly regulated during hematopoietic differentiation. Collectively, these studies identify a new member of the cytokine receptor family whose increased and uncoordinated expression may lead to myeloid leukemia by altering Evi27's normal ability to control the growth and/or differentiation of hematopoietic cells.","['Tian, E', 'Sawyer, J R', 'Largaespada, D A', 'Jenkins, N A', 'Copeland, N G', 'Shaughnessy, J D Jr']","['Tian E', 'Sawyer JR', 'Largaespada DA', 'Jenkins NA', 'Copeland NG', 'Shaughnessy JD Jr']","['Arkansas Cancer Research Center, University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences, Little Rock 72205, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Blotting, Western', 'Chromosome Mapping', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 3', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'CpG Islands', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/genetics', 'Liver/metabolism', 'Male', 'Membrane Proteins/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred Strains', 'Molecular Sequence Data', '*Receptors, Cytokine', 'Receptors, Interleukin/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Interleukin-17', 'Recombinant Proteins/metabolism', 'Retroviridae/genetics', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid', 'Testis/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Up-Regulation']",2000/05/18 09:00,2000/06/10 09:00,['2000/05/18 09:00'],"['2000/05/18 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/06/10 09:00 [medline]', '2000/05/18 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.onc.1203577 [doi]'],ppublish,Oncogene. 2000 Apr 20;19(17):2098-109. doi: 10.1038/sj.onc.1203577.,"['0 (IL17RA protein, human)', '0 (IL17RB protein, human)', '0 (Il17ra protein, mouse)', '0 (Il17rb protein, mouse)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Cytokine)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-17)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)']",,,,,,,,,,"['GENBANK/AF208110', 'GENBANK/AF208111']",,,,,,,,,,

The GSTT1 gene deletion has been associated with carcinogen-induced chromosomal changes in lymphocytes, and some but not all epidemiological evidence has suggested that the GSTT1 gene deletion may increase susceptibility to myelodysplasia. We conducted a case-control study to test whether individuals with an inherited homozygous deletion of the GSTT1 gene are at increased risk of acute myeloid leukemia (AML). The GSTT1 and GST mu 1 (GSTM1) genotypes were determined by PCR using lymphocyte or bone marrow DNA from 297 AML patients and 152 controls. AML patients were selected from Southwest Oncology Group clinical studies, and controls were identified by random digit dialing in Washington state. No association was observed between the GSTT1 gene deletion and AML [race-adjusted odds ratio (OR), 0.94; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.55-1.60] or between the GSTM1 gene deletion and AML (race-adjusted OR, 1.26; 95% CI, 0.85-1.88). Patients with secondary AML had a slightly higher prevalence of the GSTT1 and GSTM1 gene deletions compared with de novo AML patients or controls, but this was consistent with chance.

Simultaneously, we measured the serum levels of the soluble forms of two subunits of the IL-6 receptor complex-ligand binding glycoprotein 80 (sIL-6R) and glycoprotein 130 (sgp130). The cytokines and receptors were evaluated in 25 untreated patients and 38 patients treated with cladribine (2-CdA), as well as in 17 healthy controls. We have correlated the serum levels of these proteins with Rai's clinical stage of the disease, the response to 2-CdA treatment and some hematological parameters. We have also evaluated the correlation of the IL-6 serum level with the concentration of OSM and IL-6 soluble receptors. IL-6 was measurable in 62/63 (98.4%), OSM in 20/25 (80%) of untreated and 14/38 (37.8%) of the treated patients. sIL-6R and sgp130 were detectable in all 63 patients and LIF in none of the CLL patients. IL-6 serum level in untreated patients was not significantly different as compared to its concentration in the control group (P>0.05). However, in the patients treated with 2-CdA the IL-6 level was significantly lower (P<0.02), and the lowest concentration was found in the patients with complete remission (CR; median 1.4pg/ml; P<0.02). The concentration of sIL-6R was significantly higher in untreated (median 61.8 ng/ml) and treated (median 50.1 ng/ml) CLL patients when compared to normal persons (median 41.2 ng/ml; P=0.04; P<0.001, respectively). There was no difference between the sIL-6R levels in the patients with CR and the healthy controls. In non-responders sIL-6R concentration was the highest and similar to its level in the untreated patients. OSM level was higher in the untreated patients (median 1.8pg/ml) than in the normal controls (median 0.0pg/ml; P<0.001) and in the CR patients (median 0.0pg/ml; P<0.03). The serum concentration of sgp130 was similar in the untreated (median 480 pg/ml) and treated (median 470 pg/ml) patients, as well as in the healthy persons (median 420 pg/ml; P>0.05). We have found significant positive correlation between the levels of sIL-6R and the lymphocytes count in CLL patients (p=0.423; P<0.001). In addition, sIL-6R and OSM serum concentrations correlated also with CLL Rai stage. In conclusion, the serum level of IL-6, OSM and sIL-6R, but not LIF and sgp130, are useful indicators of CLL activity.","['Robak, T', 'Wierzbowska, A', 'Blasinska-Morawiec, M', 'Korycka, A', 'Blonski, J Z']","['Robak T', 'Wierzbowska A', 'Blasinska-Morawiec M', 'Korycka A', 'Blonski JZ']","['Department of Hematology, Medical University of Lodz, Copernicus Hospital, Poland. robaktad@psk2.am.lodz.pl']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Mediators Inflamm,Mediators of inflammation,9209001,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antigens, CD/blood', 'Cladribine/*therapeutic use', 'Cytokine Receptor gp130', 'Female', 'Growth Inhibitors/blood', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-6/*blood', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*blood/*drug therapy', 'Lymphokines/blood', 'Male', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/blood', 'Middle Aged', 'Oncostatin M', 'Peptides/blood', 'Receptors, Interleukin-6/*blood', 'Remission Induction', 'Solubility']",2000/05/18 09:00,2000/06/08 09:00,['2000/05/18 09:00'],"['2000/05/18 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/06/08 09:00 [medline]', '2000/05/18 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/09629359990289 [doi]'],ppublish,Mediators Inflamm. 1999;8(6):277-86. doi: 10.1080/09629359990289.,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (IL6ST protein, human)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (OSM protein, human)', '0 (Peptides)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-6)', '106956-32-5 (Oncostatin M)', '133483-10-0 (Cytokine Receptor gp130)', '47M74X9YT5 (Cladribine)']",,PMC1781813,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: The study was prospective. Patients with lymphoblastic acute leukemia (LAL) were included. They received intensive chemotherapy of induction, intensification, or consolidation. At random, a group received amikacin-ceftriaxone; if no had response after 3 days, we added vancomicin and, after 7 days, amphotericin. The other group received in addition these antibiotics, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor. RESULTS: The groups were comparable in the magnitude of the initial neutropenia (< 0.5 x 10(9)/L), site of the infection, chemotherapy received germs isolated, age, and sex. The patients of the group that received FEC-G were cured in the course of 3.1 days; in the group without FEC-G, this occurred in 7.2 days (p = 0.0001). At the end of the infectious episode, the number of neutrophils, in the group with FEC-G, was of 1.9 x 10(9)/L versus 0.7 x 10(9)/L (p = 0.0009). The mortality was of one and two cases (p = 0.46).

Four active compounds were found with IC(50) values less than 10 microg/mL in the two cancer cell lines. Oncocalyxones A and C, both 1,4-anthracenediones from Auxemma oncocalyx (Boraginaceae), showed cytotoxicity with mean IC(50) values of 0.8-2, 7-8 and 12-13 microg/mL against CEM, SW1573 and CCD922, respectively. One diterpene and one flavonoid, both from Egletes viscosa (Compositae), were also active. 12-Acetoxy-hawtriwaic acid lactone was cytotoxic with mean IC(50) values of 6, 10 and 10 microg/mL, respectively. 4,5-Dihydroxy-3,3,7, 8-tetramethoxy flavone (ternatin) was only growth-inhibitory with mean IC(50) values of 2, 1 and 10 microg/mL, respectively. These four most active compounds were examined further for their effects on DNA integrity and on DNA synthesis. All but ternatin caused substantial DNA damage and marked inhibition of 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine incorporation within 24 h.

The GERMIVIC Group.,107-11,"The putative role of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection in the pathophysiology of lymphoproliferative diseases (LPD) is supported by North American and southern European studies reporting high HCV seroprevalence in patients with B-cell-non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL). In order to evaluate the situation in France, we conducted a retrospective national study about the association of chronic HCV infection and LPD. 72 Internal Medicine and Infectious Diseases departments were contacted. Response rate was 51.4%. We recorded 43 LPD (19 males, 24 females): 31 B-cell-NHL, 4 Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia, 3 chronic lymphocytic leukemia, 2 multiple myeloma, 2 lymphomas of the mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue, and 1 Hodgkin's disease. Mean age at HCV diagnosis was 62 years (range 33-84). In 16 cases, LPD occurred in patients known to be HCV-infected. For 11 patients, LPD diagnosis preceded the diagnosis of HCV infection, whereas diagnosis was done simultaneously in 11 patients. For those with accurate infection date, mean interval between both events was 15.2 years. Fourteen patients had HCV extrahepatic manifestations: 9 mixed cryoglobulinemia, including 7 with NHL, 5 sicca syndrome (5 NHL), and both in one patient. Cohort of HCV-infected patients could be accurately determined for 16 departments, totaling 1,485 patients and 37 cases. Thus, from our data the frequency of LPD among HCV-infected patients approximates 2. 49%. Despite possible bias inherent to this retrospective study, our data support the hypothesis of HCV-associated LPD and particularly B-cell-NHL. In France, this association is much lower than in Italy. Further studies are needed to assess the precise role of HCV in the multistep process leading to monoclonal proliferation.","['Hausfater, P', 'Cacoub, P', 'Rosenthal, E', 'Bernard, N', 'Loustaud-Ratti, V', 'Le Lostec, Z', 'Laurichesse, H', 'Turpin, F', 'Ouzan, D', 'Grasset, D', 'Perrone, C', 'Cabrol, M P', 'Piette, J C']","['Hausfater P', 'Cacoub P', 'Rosenthal E', 'Bernard N', 'Loustaud-Ratti V', 'Le Lostec Z', 'Laurichesse H', 'Turpin F', 'Ouzan D', 'Grasset D', 'Perrone C', 'Cabrol MP', 'Piette JC']","['Service de Medecine Interne, Secretariat du GERMIVIC, CHU Pitie-Salpetriere, Paris, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",United States,Am J Hematol,American journal of hematology,7610369,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Female', 'France', 'Hepatitis C/*complications', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Lymphoproliferative Disorders/epidemiology/*virology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Retrospective Studies']",2000/05/18 09:00,2000/06/24 11:00,['2000/05/18 09:00'],"['2000/05/18 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/06/24 11:00 [medline]', '2000/05/18 09:00 [entrez]']","['10.1002/(SICI)1096-8652(200006)64:2<107::AID-AJH6>3.0.CO;2-C [pii]', '10.1002/(sici)1096-8652(200006)64:2<107::aid-ajh6>3.0.co;2-c [doi]']",ppublish,Am J Hematol. 2000 Jun;64(2):107-11. doi: 10.1002/(sici)1096-8652(200006)64:2<107::aid-ajh6>3.0.co;2-c.,,,,"['Copyright 2000 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Using a recently developed real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) system, we analyzed the minimal residual disease (MRD) in bone marrow samples from seven AML patients with t(8;21) at different time points during the clinical courses of their disease. Four of these patients received chemotherapy and allogenic bone marrow transplantation (allo-BMT), and the other three were treated with chemotherapy alone. Two of the patients that received allo-BMT suffered a relapse. In these patients, the levels of AML1-MTG8 mRNA expression were shown to quantitatively increase. After re-induction chemotherapy and donor lymphocyte infusion therapy, AML went into remission and the expression levels decreased. In the other two patients receiving allo-BMT, the disease went into remission and the level of AML1-MTG8 mRNA expression remained under the detectable range. The other three patients received several courses of chemotherapy, without allo-BMT, and all of them clinically reached the hematological and cytogenetic remission state. However, there were low but detectable levels of MRD in their bone marrow samples. These results suggest that the real-time quantitative PCR assay is very useful for the monitoring of MRD and detecting an early relapse. This assay may also be useful in determining the quantitative difference in myelo-ablative activity between the chemotherapy alone and chemotherapy in conjunction with allo-BMT.","['Sugimoto, T', 'Das, H', 'Imoto, S', 'Murayama, T', 'Gomyo, H', 'Chakraborty, S', 'Taniguchi, R', 'Isobe, T', 'Nakagawa, T', 'Nishimura, R', 'Koizumi, T']","['Sugimoto T', 'Das H', 'Imoto S', 'Murayama T', 'Gomyo H', 'Chakraborty S', 'Taniguchi R', 'Isobe T', 'Nakagawa T', 'Nishimura R', 'Koizumi T']","['Hyogo Institute of Clinical Research, Akashi, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Am J Hematol,American journal of hematology,7610369,IM,"['Adult', 'Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 21', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 8', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Computer Systems', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*diagnosis/*genetics/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm, Residual/*diagnosis', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'RUNX1 Translocation Partner 1 Protein', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Transcription Factors/genetics', '*Translocation, Genetic', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",2000/05/18 09:00,2000/06/24 11:00,['2000/05/18 09:00'],"['2000/05/18 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/06/24 11:00 [medline]', '2000/05/18 09:00 [entrez]']","['10.1002/(SICI)1096-8652(200006)64:2<101::AID-AJH5>3.0.CO;2-X [pii]', '10.1002/(sici)1096-8652(200006)64:2<101::aid-ajh5>3.0.co;2-x [doi]']",ppublish,Am J Hematol. 2000 Jun;64(2):101-6. doi: 10.1002/(sici)1096-8652(200006)64:2<101::aid-ajh5>3.0.co;2-x.,"['0 (AML1-ETO fusion protein, human)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RUNX1 Translocation Partner 1 Protein)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",,,"['Copyright 2000 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We studied its passage across the blood-brain barrier (BBB) from blood to brain and spinal cord. Although a large amount of LIF was reversibly associated with the cerebral vasculature, intact LIF did reach brain parenchyma. Multiple-time regression analysis showed ready access of LIF to the CNS at a rate much faster than that of the vascular marker albumin. Excess LIF inhibited the entry of 125I-LIF after administration i.v. or by in-situ perfusion in blood-free buffer. Efflux of LIF from brain to blood was slower than reabsorption by CSF bulk flow, indicating that LIF tended to be retained in the brain. Although ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF) and LIF bind to the same receptor complex, CNTF did not cross-inhibit the entry of LIF into the CNS. A monoclonal antibody to LIF, however, abolished the entry of LIF. Our results show that peripherally administered LIF readily enters the brain and spinal cord by a saturable transport system across the BBB that may have biological implications.","['Pan, W', 'Kastin, A J', 'Brennan, J M']","['Pan W', 'Kastin AJ', 'Brennan JM']","['VA Medical Center and Tulane University School of Medicine, New Orleans, LA 70112, USA. wpan@mailhost.tcs.tulane.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Netherlands,J Neuroimmunol,Journal of neuroimmunology,8109498,IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies/pharmacology', 'Blood-Brain Barrier/drug effects/physiology', 'Central Nervous System/*metabolism', 'Ciliary Neurotrophic Factor/pharmacology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Stability', 'Growth Inhibitors/antagonists & inhibitors/blood/immunology/*pharmacokinetics', 'Humans', '*Interleukin-6', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Lymphokines/antagonists & inhibitors/blood/immunology/*pharmacokinetics', 'Mice', 'Recombinant Proteins/blood/pharmacokinetics', 'Tissue Distribution']",2000/05/18 09:00,2000/07/06 11:00,['2000/05/18 09:00'],"['2000/05/18 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/07/06 11:00 [medline]', '2000/05/18 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0165572800002411 [pii]', '10.1016/s0165-5728(00)00241-1 [doi]']",ppublish,J Neuroimmunol. 2000 Jul 1;106(1-2):172-80. doi: 10.1016/s0165-5728(00)00241-1.,"['0 (Antibodies)', '0 (Ciliary Neurotrophic Factor)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)']",,,,['DK54880/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Fifteen minutes before the LPS injection, anti-rat LIF antibody or control serum was given iv or icv. The antibody was administered at two different concentrations, i.e. undiluted and five-times diluted. Irrespective of the route of administration, the anti-LIF antibody partially but significantly suppressed ACTH responses to LPS, and its suppressive effect was similar between its two different concentrations. These results indicate that the anti-LIF antibody already exerted its maximal effects at its diluted preparation, and hence that the role of LIF in LPS-stimulated ACTH secretion is essentially partial. This is the first study to demonstrate in vivo that LIF in both the brain and general circulation plays a significant role in mediating endotoxin-stimulated ACTH secretion in the rat.","['Watanobe, H', 'Suda, T']","['Watanobe H', 'Suda T']","['Third Department of Internal Medicine, Hirosaki University School of Medicine, 5 Zaifu-cho, Hirosaki, Aomori, Japan. watanobe@infoaomori.ne.jp']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Netherlands,Brain Res,Brain research,0045503,IM,"['Adrenocorticotropic Hormone/blood/*drug effects/*metabolism', 'Animals', 'Antibodies/pharmacology', 'Antibody Specificity', 'Brain/cytology/*drug effects/*metabolism', 'Endotoxins/*pharmacology', 'Growth Inhibitors/immunology/*metabolism', 'Hypothalamo-Hypophyseal System/drug effects/physiology', '*Interleukin-6', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Lipopolysaccharides/pharmacology', 'Lymphokines/immunology/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Rats', 'Rats, Wistar', 'Time Factors']",2000/05/18 09:00,2000/08/01 11:00,['2000/05/18 09:00'],"['2000/05/18 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/08/01 11:00 [medline]', '2000/05/18 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-8993(00)02167-3 [pii]', '10.1016/s0006-8993(00)02167-3 [doi]']",ppublish,Brain Res. 2000 May 19;865(1):97-101. doi: 10.1016/s0006-8993(00)02167-3.,"['0 (Antibodies)', '0 (Endotoxins)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lipopolysaccharides)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '9002-60-2 (Adrenocorticotropic Hormone)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We now report high titers of IgG antibodies directed against O-acetylated derivatives of sialic acids (O-AcSA) in serum of ALL patients. These antibodies were purified using bovine submaxillary mucin (BSM) and the IgG distribution was confined to IgG(1)and IgG(2)subclasses; their binding was totally abolished with de-O-acetylation confirming their specificity towards O-AcSA determinants. Flow cytometry demonstrated binding of these antibody fractions to peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) of both T- and B-ALL patients having increased cell surface 9-O-AcSA determinants. Western blotting of membranes derived from PBMC of ALL patients confirmed binding of the antibody to O-acetylated sialoglycoconjugates corresponding to 144, 135, 120, 90, and 36 kDa whereas binding to PBMC from normal individuals corresponded to 144 and 36 kDa. Specificity of the antibody fraction towards 9-O-AcSA was substantiated by hemagglutination and hemagglutination-inhibition assays. The antibody purified from ALL serum selectively mediates complement dependent cytolysis of lymphoblasts expressing O-AcSAs and thereby possibly confers passive protection. The enhanced anti O-AcSA antibody levels allowed for development of a serodiagnostic assay (BSM-ELISA) specific for ALL. Minimal crossreactivity was observed with other hematological disorders like acute myeloid leukemia (n = 16), chronic myeloid leukemia (n = 6), chronic lymphocytic leukemia (n = 7) and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (n = 3) as well as normal healthy individuals (n = 28).

METHOD: Fifty-five children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ages 3 to 18) and their parents completed a questionnaire measure of pain sensitivity. Self-report, physiological, and observed measures of distress were collected during the study baseline LP. Children were then randomized into a psychological intervention or an attention control group. Postintervention and follow-up LPs were observed. RESULTS: Higher levels of pain sensitivity were associated with greater anxiety and pain, both prior to and during the LP. Preliminary analyses indicated that pain sensitivity moderated the effects of intervention on distress. Children who were more pain-sensitive and who received no intervention showed greater increases in LP distress over time. In contrast, children who were more pain-sensitive and who received intervention showed greater decreases in LP distress over time. CONCLUSIONS: A measurement of pain sensitivity may be useful in pediatric oncology settings for effectively targeting pain-vulnerable children for psychological intervention.

Ataxia-telangiectasia (A-T), such a condition, is associated with a high incidence of leukemia and lymphoma that develop in childhood. Although A-T is an autosomal recessive disorder, some penetrance appears in individuals with one mutated ATM gene (A-T carriers), namely, an increased risk of developing breast cancer. The gene mutated in A-T, designated ATM, is homologous to several DNA damage recognition and cell cycle checkpoint control genes from other organisms. Recent studies suggest that ATM is activated primarily in response to double-strand breaks, the major cytotoxic lesion caused by ionizing radiation, and can directly bind to and phosphorylate c-Abl, p53, and replication protein A (RPA). Analysis of ATM mutations in patients with A-T or with sporadic non-A-T cancers has suggested the existence of two classes of ATM mutation: null mutations leading to A-T and dominant negative missense mutations predisposing to cancer in the heterozygous state. Studies with A-T mouse models have helped determine the basis of lymphoid tumorigenesis in A-T and have shown that ATM plays a critical role in maintaining genetic stability by ensuring high-fidelity execution of chromosomal events. Thus, ATM appears to act as a caretaker of the genome.","['Khanna, K K']",['Khanna KK'],"['The Queensland Institute of Medical Research, Brisbane, Australia. kumkumK@qimr.edu.au']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,J Natl Cancer Inst,Journal of the National Cancer Institute,7503089,IM,"['Ataxia Telangiectasia/genetics', 'Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated Proteins', 'Cell Cycle Proteins', 'DNA-Binding Proteins', 'Forecasting', 'Humans', 'Models, Biological', 'Mutation', 'Neoplasms/*genetics', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/*genetics', 'Risk', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins']",2000/05/18 09:00,2000/06/17 09:00,['2000/05/18 09:00'],"['2000/05/18 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/06/17 09:00 [medline]', '2000/05/18 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/jnci/92.10.795 [doi]'],ppublish,J Natl Cancer Inst. 2000 May 17;92(10):795-802. doi: 10.1093/jnci/92.10.795.,"['0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (ATM protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Atm protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)']",105,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We previously showed that apoptosis induced by serum deprivation was suppressed by inhibition of c-jun expression using antisense c-jun transfected cell line, c-junAS. To elucidate the underlying mechanisms we examined the species which is responsible for apoptosis under serum deprivation. When catalase and N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC) were included in the medium, cell death under serum deprivation was effectively suppressed in F-MEL cells. Intracellular generation of hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)) was also detected under serum deprivation in parental F-MEL cells, but it was suppressed in c-junAS (+) cells, in which antisense c-jun was expressed and c-Jun protein expression was inhibited as shown by Western blot. When H(2)O(2) was directly applied to F-MEL cells at 3 mM, apoptotic cell death was induced, whereas it was suppressed in c-junAS (+) cells. Induction of apoptosis by H(2)O(2) and its inhibition by antisense c-jun was confirmed by detection of internucleosomal fragmentation of DNA, TdT-mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL)-positive cells and morphological alteration of nuclei. These results indicate that apoptosis induced by serum deprivation in F-MEL cells is mediated by H(2)O(2) and c-jun expression is essential to apoptosis induced by H(2)O(2) in F-MEL cells.","['Kim, Y H', 'Takahashi, M', 'Suzuki, E', 'Niki, E']","['Kim YH', 'Takahashi M', 'Suzuki E', 'Niki E']","['Research Center for Advanced Science and Technology, University of Tokyo, 4-6-1 Komaba, Meguro-ku, Tokyo, 153-8904, Japan. sarah@oxygen.rcast.u-tokyo.ac.jp']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Biochem Biophys Res Commun,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,0372516,IM,"['Acetylcysteine/pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Catalase/pharmacology', 'Culture Media, Serum-Free', 'DNA Fragmentation/drug effects', 'DNA, Antisense/*pharmacology', 'Flow Cytometry', '*Friend murine leukemia virus', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'Genes, jun/*genetics', 'Hydrogen Peroxide/*pharmacology', 'In Situ Nick-End Labeling', '*Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute', 'Mice', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-jun/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2000/05/18 09:00,2000/06/24 11:00,['2000/05/18 09:00'],"['2000/05/18 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/06/24 11:00 [medline]', '2000/05/18 09:00 [entrez]']","['10.1006/bbrc.2000.2676 [doi]', 'S0006-291X(00)92676-7 [pii]']",ppublish,Biochem Biophys Res Commun. 2000 May 19;271(3):747-52. doi: 10.1006/bbrc.2000.2676.,"['0 (Culture Media, Serum-Free)', '0 (DNA, Antisense)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-jun)', 'BBX060AN9V (Hydrogen Peroxide)', 'EC 1.11.1.6 (Catalase)', 'WYQ7N0BPYC (Acetylcysteine)']",,,['Copyright 2000 Academic Press.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The chimeric protein was efficiently expressed and transported to the surfaces of various cell types and supported HIV-1 entry into human cells. A packaging cell line producing retroviral vectors carrying chimeric envelope proteins was then established. The vector particles produced were shown to be capable of specific gene transfer into human cells expressing HIV envelope glycoprotein. Blocking experiments confirmed that the vector particles entered the cells via an interaction between the chimeric and HIV envelope proteins.

Although a prolonged complete response (CR) is achieved in up to 70-80% of patients, long term complications, such as secondary leukemia, are of concern. Cyclophosphamide, vincristine, procarbazine, prednisone, doxorubicin, bleomycin, and vinblastine (C-MOPP/ABV) is a hybrid chemotherapy in which cyclophosphamide is substituted for mechlorethamine, an agent that has been implicated as the cause of secondary malignancies. METHODS: Seventy-three patients (37 males and 36 females; median age, 35 years) diagnosed with Stage III or IV HD or Stage II with bulky disease, B-symptoms, elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate, or hilar adenopathy were treated with 8 courses of C-MOPP/ABV at a single institution during a 6-year period. Radiotherapy (RT) was administered when bulky disease or residual masses were present. Endpoints of the study were response to therapy, failure free survival (FFS), overall survival (OS), and toxicity. RESULTS: Sixty-five patients (90%) received the 8 planned courses, with 49 of them (70%) receiving the full prescribed doses. After chemotherapy, 57 patients (78%) reached CR. Seven additional patients who achieved partial response (PR) reached CR after complementary radiotherapy, with an overall CR rate of 88%. The median follow-up was 31 months. Twelve patients relapsed; the 4-year FFS was 66% (95% CI, 54-78%). Two patients died during treatment because of sepsis and four due to disease progression. The 4-year OS was 92% (95% CI, 86-98%). Age > 60 years and bone marrow involvement were related to severe infectious complications. No late toxicity was reported. CONCLUSIONS: C-MOPP/ABV induces CR with acceptable toxicity in a high proportion of advanced HD patients.","['Montoto, S', 'Camos, M', 'Lopez-Guillermo, A', 'Bosch, F', 'Cervantes, F', 'Blande, J', 'Esteve, J', 'Cobo, F', 'Nomdedeu, B', 'Campo, E', 'Montserrat, E']","['Montoto S', 'Camos M', 'Lopez-Guillermo A', 'Bosch F', 'Cervantes F', 'Blande J', 'Esteve J', 'Cobo F', 'Nomdedeu B', 'Campo E', 'Montserrat E']","[""Hematology Department, Hospital Clinic, Institut d'Investigacions Biomediques Agust Pi i Sunyer, Barcelona, Spain.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Hormonal/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Bleomycin/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Confidence Intervals', 'Cyclophosphamide/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Doxorubicin/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Hodgkin Disease/*drug therapy', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local/pathology', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Prednisone/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Procarbazine/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Radiotherapy, Adjuvant', 'Remission Induction', 'Survival Rate', 'Vinblastine/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Vincristine/administration & dosage/adverse effects']",2000/05/17 09:00,2000/06/03 09:00,['2000/05/17 09:00'],"['2000/05/17 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/06/03 09:00 [medline]', '2000/05/17 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/(SICI)1097-0142(20000501)88:9<2142::AID-CNCR21>3.0.CO;2-M [pii]'],ppublish,Cancer. 2000 May 1;88(9):2142-8.,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Hormonal)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '11056-06-7 (Bleomycin)', '35S93Y190K (Procarbazine)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '5V9KLZ54CY (Vinblastine)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'VB0R961HZT (Prednisone)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study assessed the utility of mitoxantrone and intermediate-dose cytarabine (Ara-C) in the treatment of patients with recurrent or refractory AML. METHODS: Forty-seven patients with recurrent or refractory AML were treated with Ara-C, 0.5 gm/m2, intravenously (i.v.) every 12 hours x 12 doses on Days 1-6 and mitoxantrone, 5 mg/m2, i.v. on Days 1-5. RESULTS: Twenty-nine of the 47 patients (62%) achieved a complete response. The median duration of disease remission was 112 days (range, 29 days- 8 years). Of the 25 patients age > or = 60 years, 19 (76%) had a complete disease remission and the median duration of disease remission in this group was 114 days (range, 33-370 days), although all patients subsequently developed a disease recurrence. The chemotherapy generally was well tolerated, with a mean duration of neutropenia of 31 days and a mean duration of thrombocytopenia of 33 days. Three patients died of infectious complications between 23-26 days after the initiation of chemotherapy, 1 patient died of sudden cardiac arrest 13 days after the initiation of chemotherapy, and 1 patient developed cutaneous desquamation. Three patients developed acute cerebellar dysfunction. CONCLUSIONS: The use of mitoxantrone and Ara-C is effective in the treatment of patients with recurrent and refractory AML. The subgroup of patients age > or = 60 years also had a high rate of disease remission induction with this regimen, and the regimen generally was well tolerated.","['Sternberg, D W', 'Aird, W', 'Neuberg, D', 'Thompson, L', 'MacNeill, K', 'Amrein, P', 'Shulman, L N']","['Sternberg DW', 'Aird W', 'Neuberg D', 'Thompson L', 'MacNeill K', 'Amrein P', 'Shulman LN']","[""Department of Medicine, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,IM,"['Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/*administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Cause of Death', 'Cerebellar Diseases/chemically induced', 'Cytarabine/*administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Death, Sudden, Cardiac/etiology', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Drug Eruptions/etiology', 'Exanthema/chemically induced', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Injections, Intravenous', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mitoxantrone/*administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local/*drug therapy', 'Neutropenia/chemically induced', 'Remission Induction', 'Thrombocytopenia/chemically induced', 'Treatment Outcome']",2000/05/17 09:00,2000/06/03 09:00,['2000/05/17 09:00'],"['2000/05/17 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/06/03 09:00 [medline]', '2000/05/17 09:00 [entrez]']","['10.1002/(SICI)1097-0142(20000501)88:9<2037::AID-CNCR8>3.0.CO;2-K [pii]', '10.1002/(sici)1097-0142(20000501)88:9<2037::aid-cncr8>3.0.co;2-k [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer. 2000 May 1;88(9):2037-41. doi: 10.1002/(sici)1097-0142(20000501)88:9<2037::aid-cncr8>3.0.co;2-k.,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', 'BZ114NVM5P (Mitoxantrone)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To unravel the underlying mechanisms, we developed a rat model with selective cranial Co60-irradiation technique. Infantile (12-16 d old) or juvenile (21-23 d old) female Sprague-Dawley rats received a single dose of 4, 5, 6, 9 or 2 x 9 Gy (at days 21 and 23). Each group consisted of 7-20 animals. High radiation doses (9 Gy and more) caused retardation of sexual development, whereas low radiation doses (5 or 6 Gy) led to accelerated onset of puberty in 20% of infantile irradiated rats animals as determined by vaginal opening. Interestingly, at peripubertal age (postnatal day 32-34), 5 or 6 Gy infantile irradiated rats had significantly higher serum LH levels stimulated by GnRH and estradiol levels (p < 0.05). 2 x 9 Gy irradiated rats had at the age of 3 mo a marked growth retardation and significantly lower GH levels than the controls (p < 0.05) whereas prolactin, FSH, TSH, T4, and corticosterone levels were comparable with controls. These studies demonstrate that the GnRH-pulse generator is very radiosensitive as precocious activation occurred after low dose irradiation (5 or 6 Gy) of infantile rats without any other endocrine disorder. High radiation doses (9 or 2 x 9 Gy) induced retardation of sexual maturation and later on growth hormone deficiency. Moreover this model of cranial irradiation seems to be suitable to study the molecular mechanisms of radiation induced pubertal changes.","['Roth, C', 'Schmidberger, H', 'Schaper, O', 'Leonhardt, S', 'Lakomek, M', 'Wuttke, W', 'Jarry, H']","['Roth C', 'Schmidberger H', 'Schaper O', 'Leonhardt S', 'Lakomek M', 'Wuttke W', 'Jarry H']","[""Children's Hospital, University of Gottingen, Germany.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Pediatr Res,Pediatric research,0100714,IM,"['Age Factors', 'Animals', 'Body Weight/radiation effects', 'Corticosterone/blood', 'Cranial Irradiation/*adverse effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Radiation', 'Estradiol/blood', 'Female', 'Follicle Stimulating Hormone/blood', 'Gonadotropin-Releasing Hormone/pharmacology', 'Growth/radiation effects', 'Growth Hormone/blood/deficiency/drug effects', 'Growth Hormone-Releasing Hormone/pharmacology', 'Leptin/blood', 'Luteinizing Hormone/blood/drug effects', 'Prolactin/blood', 'Rats', 'Rats, Sprague-Dawley', 'Sexual Maturation/*radiation effects', 'Thyrotropin/blood', 'Thyroxine/blood']",2000/05/17 09:00,2000/07/15 11:00,['2000/05/17 09:00'],"['2000/05/17 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/07/15 11:00 [medline]', '2000/05/17 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1203/00006450-200005000-00005 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Res. 2000 May;47(5):586-91. doi: 10.1203/00006450-200005000-00005.,"['0 (Leptin)', '33515-09-2 (Gonadotropin-Releasing Hormone)', '4TI98Z838E (Estradiol)', '9002-62-4 (Prolactin)', '9002-67-9 (Luteinizing Hormone)', '9002-68-0 (Follicle Stimulating Hormone)', '9002-71-5 (Thyrotropin)', '9002-72-6 (Growth Hormone)', '9034-39-3 (Growth Hormone-Releasing Hormone)', 'Q51BO43MG4 (Thyroxine)', 'W980KJ009P (Corticosterone)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This difference was significant for all MDS categories. Serum cholesterol and HDL were negatively related to biopsy cellularity (p = 0.001 and 0.0001, respectively), and serum triglycerides were negatively related to labeling index (p = 0.0003). No differences were noted in the lipid profiles of MDS patients with normal versus abnormal karyotypes. However, low-risk MDS patients with abnormal karyotypes had significantly lower triglyceride levels compared with the high-risk patients (p = 0.027), as did low-risk patients with normal cytogenetics (p = 0.015). Serum HDL levels were significantly higher for the low-risk group with normal cytogenetics as well (p = 0.003). We conclude that serum cholesterol, LDL, and HDL are significantly reduced in MDS patients, probably indicating excessive intracellular lipid biosynthesis in the expanding clone.

CNTF stimulates gene expression, cell survival or differentiation in a variety of neuronal cell types such as sensory, sympathetic, ciliary and motor neurons. In addition, effects of CNTF on oligodendrocytes as well as denervated and intact skeletal muscle have been documented. CNTF itself lacks a classical signal peptide sequence of a secreted protein, but is thought to convey its cytoprotective effects after release from adult glial cells by some mechanism induced by injury. Interestingly, mice that are homozygous for an inactivated CNTF gene develop normally and initially thrive. Only later in adulthood do they exhibit a mild loss of motor neurons with resulting muscle weakness, leading to the suggestion that CNTF is not essential for neural development, but instead acts in response to injury or other stresses. The CNTF receptor complex is most closely related to, and shares subunits with the receptor complexes for interleukin-6 and leukemia inhibitory factor. The specificity conferring alpha subunit of the CNTF complex (CNTFR alpha), is extremely well conserved across species, and has a distribution localized predominantly to the nervous system and skeletal muscle. CNTFR alpha lacks a conventional transmembrane domain and is thought to be anchored to the cell membrane by a glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol linkage. Mice lacking CNTFR alpha die perinatally, perhaps indicating the existence of a second developmentally important CNTF-like ligand. Signal transduction by CNTF requires that it bind first to CNTFR alpha, permitting the recruitment of gp130 and LIFR beta, forming a tripartite receptor complex. CNTF-induced heterodimerization of the beta receptor subunits leads to tyrosine phosphorylation (through constitutively associated JAKs), and the activated receptor provides docking sites for SH2-containing signaling molecules, such as STAT proteins. Activated STATs dimerize and translocate to the nucleus to bind specific DNA sequences, resulting in enhanced transcription of responsive genes. The neuroprotective effects of CNTF have been demonstrated in a number of in vitro cell models as well as in vivo in mutant mouse strains which exhibit motor neuron degeneration. Intracerebral administration of CNTF and CNTF analogs has also been shown to protect striatal output neurons in rodent and primate models of Huntington's disease. Treatment of humans and animals with CNTF is also known to induce weight loss characterized by a preferential loss of body fat. When administered systemically, CNTF activates downstream signaling molecules such as STAT-3 in areas of the hypothalamus which regulate food intake. In addition to its neuronal actions, CNTF and analogs have been shown to act on non-neuronal cells such as glia, hepatocytes, skeletal muscle, embryonic stem cells and bone marrow stromal cells.","['Sleeman, M W', 'Anderson, K D', 'Lambert, P D', 'Yancopoulos, G D', 'Wiegand, S J']","['Sleeman MW', 'Anderson KD', 'Lambert PD', 'Yancopoulos GD', 'Wiegand SJ']","['Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Tarrytown, NY 10591-6707, USA. mark.sleeman@regpha.com']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Switzerland,Pharm Acta Helv,Pharmaceutica acta Helvetiae,0401134,IM,"['Animals', 'Ciliary Neurotrophic Factor/biosynthesis/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Ligands', 'Mice', 'Obesity/genetics/physiopathology', 'Receptor, Ciliary Neurotrophic Factor/biosynthesis/*physiology']",2000/05/17 09:00,2000/08/12 11:00,['2000/05/17 09:00'],"['2000/05/17 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/08/12 11:00 [medline]', '2000/05/17 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1016/s0031-6865(99)00050-3 [doi]'],ppublish,Pharm Acta Helv. 2000 Mar;74(2-3):265-72. doi: 10.1016/s0031-6865(99)00050-3.,"['0 (Ciliary Neurotrophic Factor)', '0 (Ligands)', '0 (Receptor, Ciliary Neurotrophic Factor)']",61,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The following experiments were undertaken to understand the mechanisms whereby TEL/PDGFbetaR transforms cells. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Activation of JAK and STAT proteins was studied in an interleukin 3 (IL-3)-dependent cell line, Ba/F3, transformed to IL-3 independence by TEL/PDGFbetaR. RESULTS: TEL/PDGFbetaR activates STAT1 and STAT5 in transformed Ba/F3 cells through a JAK-independent pathway. Activation of STAT proteins requires the kinase activity of TEL/PDGFbetaR. JAK1, JAK2, JAK3, and TYK2 are not phosphorylated by TEL/PDGFbetaR. However, TEL/PDGFbetaR can phosphorylate STAT5 in transiently transfected COS cells, suggesting that TEL/PDGFbetaR may itself be the kinase involved in tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT proteins. In contrast, native PDGFbetaR stimulated by PDGF ligand does not activate STAT proteins to a significant degree in this hematopoietic context. STAT1 and STAT5 also are activated by TEL/ABL and TEL/JAK2 fusion proteins associated with human leukemia.

In the present study, we investigated the potential of CpG-ODN to induce functional high-affinity receptors in leukemic and normal B cells and the effects of costimulation with IL-2 on proliferation, cytokine secretion, and surface molecule regulation. METHODS: Highly purified B cells from B-CLL patients and normal controls were stimulated with CpG-ODN with or without IL-2. Expression of CD25 was determined using FACS, and the presence of high-affinity IL-2 receptors was determined by scatchard analysis. Costimulatory effects of IL-2 and CpG-ODN were investigated using proliferation assays, ELISA (IL-6, TNF-alpha), and FACS analysis (CD80, CD86 expression). Reactivity of autologous and allogeneic T cells toward activated B-CLL cells was determined in mixed lymphocyte reactions and Interferon-gamma Elispot assays. RESULTS: The CpG-ODN DSP30 caused a significantly stronger induction of the IL-2 receptor alpha chain in malignant as compared with normal B cells (p = 0.03). This resulted in the expression of functional high-affinity IL-2 receptors in B-CLL cells, but fewer numbers of receptors with less affinity were expressed in normal B cells. Although addition of IL-2 to CpG-ODN-stimulated cells augmented proliferation in both normal B cells and B-CLL cells, no costimulatory effect on cytokine production or surface molecule expression could be observed in normal B cells. In contrast, TNF-alpha and IL-6 production was increased in B-CLL cells, and the expression of CD80 and CD86 was further enhanced when IL-2 was used as a costimulus. Autologous and allogeneic immune recognition of B-CLL cells stimulated with CpG-ODN and IL-2 was increased compared with B-CLL cells stimulated with CpG-ODN alone. CONCLUSION: Stimulation of B-CLL cells with CpG-ODN and IL-2 might be an attractive strategy for potential immunotherapies for B-CLL patients.","['Decker, T', 'Schneller, F', 'Kronschnabl, M', 'Dechow, T', 'Lipford, G B', 'Wagner, H', 'Peschel, C']","['Decker T', 'Schneller F', 'Kronschnabl M', 'Dechow T', 'Lipford GB', 'Wagner H', 'Peschel C']","['IIIrd Department of Medicine and, Technical University of Munich, Munich, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,IM,"['Adjuvants, Immunologic/*pharmacology', 'Antigens, CD/genetics', 'B-Lymphocytes/drug effects/*immunology', 'B7-1 Antigen/genetics', 'B7-2 Antigen', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Gene Expression Regulation/drug effects/immunology', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-2/pharmacology', 'Interleukin-6/genetics', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/blood/*immunology/pathology', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/genetics', '*Oligodeoxyribonucleotides', 'Oligonucleotides/*pharmacology', 'Receptors, Interleukin-2/*genetics', 'Reference Values', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/genetics']",2000/05/17 09:00,2000/06/17 09:00,['2000/05/17 09:00'],"['2000/05/17 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/06/17 09:00 [medline]', '2000/05/17 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0301-472X(00)00144-2 [pii]', '10.1016/s0301-472x(00)00144-2 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Hematol. 2000 May;28(5):558-68. doi: 10.1016/s0301-472x(00)00144-2.,"['0 (Adjuvants, Immunologic)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (B7-1 Antigen)', '0 (B7-2 Antigen)', '0 (CD86 protein, human)', '0 (CPG-oligonucleotide)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Oligodeoxyribonucleotides)', '0 (Oligonucleotides)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-2)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Chronic phase CML and normal CFU-GM were grown with and without STI571, IFN-alpha, or the two agents in combination. Colonies were plucked and replated in 96-well microtiter plates. Secondary colonies were scored, and the results were expressed as the area-under-the-curve (AUC) of the distribution of secondary colony numbers per primary CFU-GM. This value gives an overall measure of the replating ability or amplification of the original CFU-GM population. RESULTS: STI571 selectively inhibits the formation of granulocyte-macrophage colony-forming cells (CFU-GM) from CML patients. It also significantly inhibits the amplification of CML CFU-GM (p = 0.002) as measured by secondary colony formation after replating primary CFU-GM colonies. In contrast, amplification of normal CFU-GM was enhanced (p = 0.001) at low concentrations (0.1 microM) of STI571 with a return to baseline at 10 microM STI571. Addition of interferon (IFN)-alpha to STI571 abolished the increase in normal CFU-GM amplification seen with either agent alone. There was a highly significant correlation between the in vitro response to STI571 and the in vitro response to IFN-alpha (r = 0.74 for CML cells, and 0.77 for normal cells). CONCLUSION: We conclude that STI571, like IFN-alpha, preferentially suppresses amplification of CML CFU-GM while sparing normal CFU-GM.","['Marley, S B', 'Deininger, M W', 'Davidson, R J', 'Goldman, J M', 'Gordon, M Y']","['Marley SB', 'Deininger MW', 'Davidson RJ', 'Goldman JM', 'Gordon MY']","['Department of Haematology, LRF Centre for Adult Leukaemia, Imperial College School of Medicine, Hammersmith Hospital, London, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Bone Marrow Cells/cytology', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'Cytokines/pharmacology', 'Granulocytes/*cytology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Interferon-alpha/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*blood', 'Macrophages/*cytology', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Pyrimidines/*pharmacology', 'Recombinant Proteins/pharmacology']",2000/05/17 09:00,2000/06/17 09:00,['2000/05/17 09:00'],"['2000/05/17 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/06/17 09:00 [medline]', '2000/05/17 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0301-472X(00)00142-9 [pii]', '10.1016/s0301-472x(00)00142-9 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Hematol. 2000 May;28(5):551-7. doi: 10.1016/s0301-472x(00)00142-9.,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Interferon-alpha)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We immunocytochemically studied IgE isotype switching of leukemic B cells from 25 cases and three cell lines established from the leukemias after stimulation with anti-CD40 mAb, plus each of the following cytokines: interleukin 2 (IL-2); IL-4; IL-10; tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha); and transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta). Also, genomic Cepsilon and Cepsilon transcripts were analyzed by polymerase chain reaction and reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: Leukemic cells from hairy cell leukemia variant and its cell line, with deletion of the Cepsilon gene, did not undergo IgE isotype switching in response to any of the stimuli. In contrast, a cell line (FH-5) established from chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells, bearing the Cepsilon gene, underwent the highest level of IgE isotype switching on stimulation with anti-CD40 mAb and IL-4. This response was correlated with the production of Cepsilon transcripts. IL-4, IL-10, and TNF-alpha induced higher levels of IgE isotype switching than the others. No IgE isotype switching was observed in any of the non-Hodgkin's lymphomas examined, except mantle cell lymphoma and lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma. Percentages of CD40(+) cells in five cases with follicular lymphoma were significantly lower than the other leukemias. CONCLUSIONS: IgE isotype switching induced by anti-CD40 mAb with cytokines other than IL-4 was first demonstrated, whereas none of the non-Hodgkin's lymphomas except mantle cell lymphoma and lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma showed IgE isotype switching in response to any of the stimuli.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We investigated FasR expression in primary AML cells and its upregulation by tumor necrosis factor (TNF), as well as the apoptosis induced by anti-Fas antibody and the potential interaction between the FasR-FasL system and the cytotoxic drug daunorubicin (DNR). RESULTS: FasR was expressed on all 25 AML samples and three normal bone marrow harvests. The intensity of expression was variable (range 1. 6-2.1 in normal bone marrow CD34(+) cells and 1.5-5.1 in AML cells, median 2.4) and was related to the morphologic FAB classification, with the highest expression in FAB types M4 and M5 (range 1.6-5.1, median 3.2). No relationship was found between FasR expression and expression of the CD34 antigen. FasR was heterogeneously upregulated in all AML cells on treatment with TNF-alpha. The degree of FasR upregulation induced was found to be related to the FAB subtype, with the greatest response observed in immature FAB types M1, M2, and M6 (range 11.0-207.1%, median 48.7%). Apoptosis could be induced in all AML samples, but not in normal bone marrow CD34(+)ve cells, by the CH11 anti-FasR antibody, although the response was variable (range 4.1-37.6%, median 16.5%). The monocytic differentiated M4 and M5 AML cells exhibited the greatest sensitivity to Fas-mediated apoptosis (range 4.4-37.6, median 20.65%); however, no relationship was found between sensitivity to Fas-mediated apoptosis and FasR expression or CD34 positivity. Apoptosis in response to DNR was observed in all AML cases; however, sensitivity was heterogeneous and found to be unrelated to FasR expression or sensitivity to Fas-mediated apoptosis. The blocking anti-FasR antibody ZB4 blocked anti-FasR-mediated apoptosis but had no inhibitory effect on DNR-induced apoptosis in AML blasts. No cytotoxic synergistic effect was demonstrated when anti-FasR antibody was used in combination with DNR. CONCLUSION: In AML, DNR induces apoptosis through an Fas-independent pathway. However, the induction of apoptosis through the Fas pathway might be a novel and effective approach for leukemia immunotherapy, particularly because Fas-mediated apoptosis was noted in CD34(+) and CD34(-) cases.","['Lewis, N R', 'Pallis, M', 'Russell, N H']","['Lewis NR', 'Pallis M', 'Russell NH']","['Department of Haematology, Nottingham City Hospital and University of Nottingham, Nottingham, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,IM,"['Antigens, CD34/*immunology', 'Apoptosis', 'Blast Crisis/immunology/pathology', 'Bone Marrow Cells/cytology/immunology/pathology', 'Fas Ligand Protein', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology/*immunology/pathology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/immunology', 'Leukemia, Monocytic, Acute/immunology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*immunology/pathology', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Acute/immunology', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/genetics/*immunology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'fas Receptor/genetics/*immunology']",2000/05/17 09:00,2000/06/17 09:00,['2000/05/17 09:00'],"['2000/05/17 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/06/17 09:00 [medline]', '2000/05/17 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0301-472X(00)00132-6 [pii]', '10.1016/s0301-472x(00)00132-6 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Hematol. 2000 May;28(5):535-42. doi: 10.1016/s0301-472x(00)00132-6.,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (FASLG protein, human)', '0 (Fas Ligand Protein)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (fas Receptor)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We previously demonstrated that p15(INK4B) is expressed in normal myeloid cells. The aim of this study was to investigate whether p15(INK4B) expression is restricted to the granulomonocytic lineage and to evaluate its modulation during normal and leukemic myeloid differentiation. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Normal CD34(+) cells were cultured in serum-free media to obtain granulomonocytic, erythroid, or megakaryocytic unilineage differentiation. NB4 promyelocytic cell line and fresh leukemic blasts from seven patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia were cultured with all-trans retinoic acid. At different times of culture, cell samples were collected to evaluate p15(INK4B) by semiquantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: p15(INK4B) mRNA was found during granulomonocytic and megakaryocytic, but not erythroid, differentiation. In the granulomonocytic lineage, p15(INK4B) was detectable when the majority of cells were at the promyelocytic stage and increased progressively in more mature elements. In the megakaryocytic lineage, p15(INK4B) was expressed in the early phase of differentiation, before megakaryoblasts had appeared, and was mantained throughout the time of culture. NB4 cell line and five of seven leukemic samples displayed undetectable or very low level of p15(INK4B) that rapidly increased during retinoic acid-induced differentiation. Two leukemic samples (both collected from two patients developing all-trans retinoic acid syndrome) showed high basal levels of p15(INK4B), which was not modified by retinoic acid treatment. CONCLUSIONS: p15(INK4B) upregulation occurs specifically during normal granulomonocytic and megakaryocytic commitment. In acute promyelocytic leukemic blasts, p15(INK4B), which is detectable at a very low level, is promptly increased by retinoic acid. In contrast, two acute promyelocytic leukemia samples obtained from patients who developed all-trans retinoic acid syndrome showed high basal levels of p15(INK4B) that did not increase further during all-trans retinoic acid-induced differentiation.","['Teofili, L', 'Morosetti, R', 'Martini, M', 'Urbano, R', 'Putzulu, R', 'Rutella, S', 'Pierelli, L', 'Leone, G', 'Larocca, L M']","['Teofili L', 'Morosetti R', 'Martini M', 'Urbano R', 'Putzulu R', 'Rutella S', 'Pierelli L', 'Leone G', 'Larocca LM']","['Departments of Hematology, Catholic University, Rome, Italy. gleone@mware.it']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,IM,"['Antigens, CD34/analysis', 'Bone Marrow Cells/cytology/pathology', 'Carrier Proteins/analysis/*genetics', '*Cell Cycle Proteins', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p15', '*Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p16', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*cytology/drug effects/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia/*blood/*pathology', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Tretinoin/pharmacology', '*Tumor Suppressor Proteins']",2000/05/17 09:00,2000/06/17 09:00,['2000/05/17 09:00'],"['2000/05/17 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/06/17 09:00 [medline]', '2000/05/17 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0301-472X(00)00139-9 [pii]', '10.1016/s0301-472x(00)00139-9 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Hematol. 2000 May;28(5):519-26. doi: 10.1016/s0301-472x(00)00139-9.,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (CDKN2B protein, human)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p15)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p16)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinases)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Autologous CD34(+) Lin(-), CD34(+) Lin(+), and CD34(-) Lin(-) marrow cells, transduced by coculture with PG13/LN, PG13/LNX, and PG13/LNY vector-producing cells, respectively, were transplanted in three female baboons. Two female baboons also were transplanted with fresh allogeneic CD34(-)Lin(-) marrow cells from MHC-matched male siblings and, to ensure survival, with autologous CD34(+)Lin(-) and CD34(+)Lin(+) marrow cells transduced with PG13/LN and PG13/LNX, respectively. The LN, LNX, and LNY vectors are identical except for different length sequences at the 3' end of the bacterial neomycin phosphotransferase (neo) gene. RESULTS: LN(+) and LNX(+) cells from CD34(+)Lin(-) and CD34(+)Lin(+) cells, respectively, but no LNY(+) from CD34(-)Lin(-) cells were detectable in blood and marrow of all animals after transplant. LN(+), CD34(+)Lin(-) cells contributed to reconstitution of the T, B, and myeloid lineages. LNX(+), CD34(+)Lin(+) cells contributed only to B and myeloid lineages. Male cells, CD34(-)Lin(-), were detected by polymerase chain reaction in blood and marrow of the two allogeneic transplanted animals at estimated frequencies of </=0.001% 1 month after transplant in both animals. Male cells became undetectable in one animal and have remained detectable, with declining frequency, in the other for more than 15 months. In this animal, no male CD34(+) or colony-forming cells have been detected. CONCLUSIONS: CD34(+)Lin(-) and CD34(+)Lin(+) marrow cells can serve as targets for GALV pseudotype retrovirus-mediated gene transfer. CD34(+)Lin(-) cells contribute to reconstitution of all hematopoietic lineages. Autologous CD34(-)Lin(-) cells were either not transduced by GALV pseudotype retrovirus vectors using current approaches or did not contribute significantly to reconstitution, as suggested by allogeneic transplants.","['Andrews, R G', 'Peterson, L J', 'Morris, J', 'Potter, J', 'Heyward, S', 'Gough, M', 'Bryant, E', 'Kiem, H P']","['Andrews RG', 'Peterson LJ', 'Morris J', 'Potter J', 'Heyward S', 'Gough M', 'Bryant E', 'Kiem HP']","['Division of Clinical Research, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, the Departments of, Seattle, WA 98109-1024, USA. randrews@fhcrc.org']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, CD34/*analysis', 'B-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Bone Marrow Cells/cytology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'Female', 'Gene Transfer Techniques', 'Genetic Vectors', 'Growth Substances/pharmacology', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology/drug effects/*immunology', 'Kanamycin Kinase/genetics', 'Leukemia Virus, Gibbon Ape', 'Male', 'Papio', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Transplantation, Homologous/*immunology', '*Whole-Body Irradiation']",2000/05/17 09:00,2000/06/17 09:00,['2000/05/17 09:00'],"['2000/05/17 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/06/17 09:00 [medline]', '2000/05/17 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0301-472X(00)00137-5 [pii]', '10.1016/s0301-472x(00)00137-5 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Hematol. 2000 May;28(5):508-18. doi: 10.1016/s0301-472x(00)00137-5.,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Growth Substances)', 'EC 2.7.1.95 (Kanamycin Kinase)']",,,,"['AI35191/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'DK47754/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'RR00166/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Two of 19 CML patients in the blastic phase (10.5%) had an extra fused BCR-ABL gene on structurally complex chromosome aberrations in addition to the Ph chromosome. Another patient had an extra ABL oncogene on the end of a deleted chromosome, resulting in three copies of the ABL oncogene.

TRAIL, a member of the TNF receptor family, induces apoptosis in many tumor cells by binding to DR4 (TRAIL receptor 1) and DR5 (TRAIL receptor 2). In contrast, TRAIL-induced apoptosis is prevented by a decoy receptor (DcR1, TRID or TRAIL receptor 3). In the present study, we compared the expression of TRAIL, DR4, DR5, and TRID between a drug sensitive HL60, a myeloid leukemia cell line, and its multidrug resistant (MDR) sublines that either overexpressed MDR 1 gene (HL60/Tax) or MRP gene (HL60/AR), using RT-PCR. TRAIL mRNA was expressed in HL60 cells but was present in low levels in HL60/AR cells and was completely lacking in HL60/Tax cells. Both DR4 and DR5 were undetectable in HL60/Tax but were present at comparable levels in HL60/AR and drug sensitive HL60 cells. TRID were absent in HL60 and HL60/Tax cells, but was present in low but comparable levels in peripheral blood mononuclear cells and HL60/AR cells. These data suggest that the multidrug resistance in MDR HL60 cell lines, regardless of overexpression of MDR 1 or MRP, may be due to different mechanisms. In HL60/AR cells it appears that MDR may be due to decreased expression of TRAIL and constitutive expression of TRID, whereas in HL60/Tax cells, MDR could be due to the absence of TRAIL and/or DR4 and DR5.","['Kim, C H', 'Gupta, S']","['Kim CH', 'Gupta S']","['Molecular Biology Laboratory, Division of Basic and Clinical Immunology, University of California, Irvine, CA 92697, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Greece,Int J Oncol,International journal of oncology,9306042,IM,"['ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters/*metabolism', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins', 'Drug Resistance, Multiple', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', '*Fungal Proteins', 'GPI-Linked Proteins', 'HL-60 Cells/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/*metabolism', 'Multidrug Resistance-Associated Proteins', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Receptors, TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand', 'Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor/metabolism', 'Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor, Member 10c', 'TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor Decoy Receptors', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/*metabolism']",2000/05/17 09:00,2000/07/06 11:00,['2000/05/17 09:00'],"['2000/05/17 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/07/06 11:00 [medline]', '2000/05/17 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.3892/ijo.16.6.1137 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Oncol. 2000 Jun;16(6):1137-9. doi: 10.3892/ijo.16.6.1137.,"['0 (ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters)', '0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (Fungal Proteins)', '0 (GPI-Linked Proteins)', '0 (MDR1 protein, Filobasidiella neoformans)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Multidrug Resistance-Associated Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand)', '0 (Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor)', '0 (Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor, Member 10c)', '0 (TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand)', '0 (TNFRSF10A protein, human)', '0 (TNFRSF10B protein, human)', '0 (TNFRSF10C protein, human)', '0 (TNFSF10 protein, human)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor Decoy Receptors)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Therefore, CGH examination was performed of DNA extracted from 23 acute and 15 chronic myeloproliferative disorders which had just been analyzed using classical cytogenetic techniques. In nearly all cases CGH analysis was repeated with reversely labeled probes. A Zeiss axioplan microscope was equipped with the ISIS 3 system for photometric evaluation of the CGH data. A main group was selected of 34 cases showing karyotypic mosaics when routinely diagnosed by classical cytogenetics. The grade of mosaicism was basically determined from the classical cytogenetic analysis and was additionally defined examining target anomalies by I-FISH analysis in 28 of the cases. The second group included 23 cases with deletions, and in 1 case another informative genomic imbalance could be analyzed. Every target anomaly irrespective of its type could be detected in all cases with an affected cell population equalling or exceeding about 25%, but in none was it below 23%. This value was the lowest and was found in a case, with CGH-detected 20q deletion. The smallest deletions of two bands on 20q which could visually be detected by CGH were estimated in the range of 5-7 Mb. CGH was also suitable to detect imbalances which were not clearly detected by routine cytogenetics. Reverse labelling, performed in nearly all cases, confirmed the result of the original CGH analysis. These data not only document the readiness and reliability of CGH studies on human leukemia, but also further contribute to a clearer definition of the limits of the resolving power of this technique.","['Gebhart, E', 'Verdorfer, I', 'Saul, W', 'Trautmann, U', 'Brecevic, L']","['Gebhart E', 'Verdorfer I', 'Saul W', 'Trautmann U', 'Brecevic L']","['Institute of Human Genetics, University of Erlangen-Nurnberg, D-91054 Erlangen, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Greece,Int J Oncol,International journal of oncology,9306042,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Bone Marrow Cells/pathology', 'Chromosome Deletion', 'Female', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Karyotyping', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/*genetics', 'Nucleic Acid Hybridization/genetics/*methods']",2000/05/17 09:00,2000/07/06 11:00,['2000/05/17 09:00'],"['2000/05/17 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/07/06 11:00 [medline]', '2000/05/17 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.3892/ijo.16.6.1099 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Oncol. 2000 Jun;16(6):1099-105. doi: 10.3892/ijo.16.6.1099.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Of 462 patients with disseminated disease, 49 (10.6%) had CNS disease at diagnosis (CNS+). CNS disease included meningeal disease or CNS parenchymal masses with or without cranial neuropathies (CSF+/Mass; CNPs) in 36 patients and isolated CNPs in 13. Of the CNS+ patients, 28 had M2 (5% to 25% blasts) or M3 (> 25% blasts) bone marrow involvement. All patients received protocol-based systemic and intrathecal chemotherapy. Thirty-six patients also received CNS irradiation. RESULTS: Relapses occurred in 21 (43%) of 49 patients, predominantly in the CNS (71%) and bone marrow (52%). The 3-year event-free survival +/- SE for all patients with CNS+ disease was 45% +/- 7%. Patients with CSF+/Mass had a nominally higher treatment failure rate compared with patients with CNS- after adjusting for marrow status and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) diagnosis, with a relative failure rate (RFR) of 1.52 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.88 to 2.6; P =.15). In comparison, the RFRs for patients with M2 or M3 marrow and for those with LDH levels greater than 500 IU/L after adjusting for CNS disease were 1.4 (95% CI, 0.96 to 2.0; P =.029) and 2.2 (95% CI, 1.5 to 3.0; P <.001), respectively. The RFR for patients with isolated CNPs was 0.87 (95% CI, 0.36 to 2.1; P =.76). CONCLUSION: We conclude that, with the treatments used during the period covered by these studies, the presence of CSF+/Mass CNS disease at diagnosis was associated with a nominally worse outcome independent of initial bone marrow status and LDH level, but the effect was not statistically significant.","['Gururangan, S', 'Sposto, R', 'Cairo, M S', 'Meadows, A T', 'Finlay, J L']","['Gururangan S', 'Sposto R', 'Cairo MS', 'Meadows AT', 'Finlay JL']","['Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center and New York University Medical Center, New York, NY, USA. gururooz@mc.duke.edu']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Central Nervous System Neoplasms/mortality/*pathology/therapy', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Cyclophosphamide/therapeutic use', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Doxorubicin/therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, B-Cell/drug therapy/mortality/*pathology', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/drug therapy/mortality/*pathology', 'Male', 'Methotrexate/therapeutic use', 'Prednisone/therapeutic use', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'Survival Analysis', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Vincristine/therapeutic use']",2000/05/16 09:00,2000/06/17 09:00,['2000/05/16 09:00'],"['2000/05/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/06/17 09:00 [medline]', '2000/05/16 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1200/JCO.2000.18.10.2017 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2000 May;18(10):2017-25. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2000.18.10.2017.,"['5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'VB0R961HZT (Prednisone)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)', 'CHOP protocol', 'COMP protocol']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We found that gp130 fusion proteins were phosphorylated exclusively on Ser-782 by LIF- and growth factor-stimulated 3T3-L1 cell extracts. Ser-780 was required for phosphorylation of Ser-782 but was not itself phosphorylated. Ser-782 is located immediately N-terminal to the di-leucine motif of gp130, which regulates internalization of the receptor. Transient expression of chimeric granulocyte colony-stimulating factor receptor (G-CSFR)-gp130(S782A) receptors resulted in increased cell surface expression in COS-7 cells and increased ability to induce vasoactive intestinal peptide gene expression in IMR-32 neuroblastoma cells when compared with expression of chimeric receptors containing wild-type gp130 cytoplasmic domains. These results identify Ser-782 as the major phosphorylated serine residue in human gp130 and indicate that this site regulates cell surface expression of the receptor polypeptide.","['Gibson, R M', 'Schiemann, W P', 'Prichard, L B', 'Reno, J M', 'Ericsson, L H', 'Nathanson, N M']","['Gibson RM', 'Schiemann WP', 'Prichard LB', 'Reno JM', 'Ericsson LH', 'Nathanson NM']","['Departments of Pharmacology and Biochemstry, University of Washington, Seattle, Washington 98195, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,IM,"['3T3 Cells', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'COS Cells', '*Growth Inhibitors', 'Humans', '*Interleukin-6', 'Leucine', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor Receptor alpha Subunit', '*Lymphokines', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Phosphorylation', 'Receptors, Cytokine/*metabolism', 'Receptors, OSM-LIF', 'Recombinant Proteins/metabolism', 'Serine', '*Signal Transduction']",2000/05/16 09:00,2000/08/29 11:01,['2000/05/16 09:00'],"['2000/05/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/08/29 11:01 [medline]', '2000/05/16 09:00 [entrez]']","['10.1074/jbc.M907658199 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(19)79703-8 [pii]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2000 Jul 21;275(29):22574-82. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M907658199.,"['0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (LIFR protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor Receptor alpha Subunit)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', '0 (Lifr protein, mouse)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Receptors, Cytokine)', '0 (Receptors, OSM-LIF)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '452VLY9402 (Serine)', 'GMW67QNF9C (Leucine)']",,,,"['F32-NS10585/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States', 'T32-NS07332/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States', 'TM32-GM07750/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epstein-Barr virus is a human herpesvirus that has been associated with certain subgroups of NHL. In this study, we measured lipid adjusted blood concentrations (in nanogram per gram) of 36 congeners of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), p, p'-dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (p,p'-DDE), hexachlorobenzene (HCB), and four subgroups of chlordanes (trans-nonachlor, cis-nonachlor, MC6, and oxychlordane) in incident cases of HCL and controls from the general population. We obtained results on organochlorines and antibodies for 54 cases and 54 controls. Titers of antibodies to the Epstein-Barr early antigen and Epstein-Barr nuclear antigen, measured as P107, were correlated to concentrations of organochlorines to evaluate the possibility of an interaction between these factors in the pathogenesis of HCL.

Titers of antibodies to Epstein-Barr early antigen IgG [Greater and equal to] 40 were correlated to an increased risk for HCL. This risk was further increased in those with a level above the median value of p,p'-DDE, HCB, or the sum of the chlordanes, suggesting an interaction between Epstein-Barr virus and a higher concentration of these chemicals.

With a comparison of its effects on other cell lineages.,153-63,"Arsenic trioxide (As2O3) has been demonstrated to be effective for the treatment of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) and to inhibit proliferation and produce apoptosis in the APL cell line NB4. The effect of this newly utilized chemotherapeutic agent on other lineages is currently under study to evaluate its efficacy for the treatment of other human malignancies and myeloproliferative syndromes. A recent study described the effects of As2O3 upon viability, proliferation, and induction of apoptosis in four different megakaryocytic leukemia cell lines. At pharmacological concentrations (0.5-2 microM) As2O3 selectively inhibits growth and causes apoptosis in the megakaryocytic leukemia cell lines HEL, Meg-01, UT7 and M07e. Pertinently, these concentrations of As2O3 resulted in identical changes in the characteristics of the APL cell line NB4, suggesting that As2O3 could produce its effects in both cellular lineages via a common mechanism of action. Various mechanisms have been proposed for the As2O3-induced changes in NB4 (including modulation of promyelocytic leukemia proteins (PML) and Bcl-2, modification of the glutathione redox system, caspase activation, and cell cycle arrest) and are currently under investigation in the megakaryocytic leukemia cell lines. Recent preliminary results indicate that As2O3 downregulates Bcl-2 expression and induces cell cycle arrest in megakaryocytic cell lines. The use of As2O3 for the treatment of malignant megakaryocytic disorders also has been considered. The in vitro effects of As2O3 on a chronic megakaryocytic proliferative disorder. i.e., Essential Thrombocythemia (ET), have been analyzed and megakaryocyte progenitors have shown an unexpectedly higher resistance to As2O3, in comparison to normal megakaryocyte colony-forming cells. The effects of As2O3 on ET and other megakaryocytic disorders need to be fully examined, in order to determine the clinical efficacy of As2O3 in the treatment of syndromes affecting the megakaryocytic lineage.","['Alemany, M', 'Levin, J']","['Alemany M', 'Levin J']","['Institut des Vaisseaux et du Sang, Hopital Lariboisiere, Paris, France. mon_alem@club-internet.fr']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", 'Review']",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals/*pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Cell Lineage/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Megakaryoblastic, Acute/*drug therapy/*pathology', 'Megakaryocytes/*drug effects/*pathology', 'Oxides/*pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Thrombocytosis/drug therapy/pathology']",2000/05/16 09:00,2000/08/01 11:00,['2000/05/16 09:00'],"['2000/05/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/08/01 11:00 [medline]', '2000/05/16 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.3109/10428190009060329 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2000 Jun;38(1-2):153-63. doi: 10.3109/10428190009060329.,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (Oxides)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)']",37,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In addition to its direct effects on leukemic cells, IFN-alpha has been shown to induce immunologic alterations, including upregulation of the expression of major histocompatibility (MHC) antigens in antigen-presenting cells (APCs), as well as augmentation of the activity of the lymphocytes against tumor cells. However, there has been little direct evidence supporting a causal interaction between cellular immunoreactivity and clinical responsiveness to IFN-alpha. We have shown that one approach to elucidate the immunological mechanisms by which IFN-alpha exerts its anti-CML activity is by analyzing therapy-induced modulation in T-cell receptor (TCR) Vbeta chain usage, using the reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) followed by single-strand conformation (SSCP) analysis. This method is particularly attractive, since it provides an index of antigen-specific T cell expansion, but does not require the extraction and purification of the antigens involved in the T-cell response. T cell clones that express the Vbeta 10, 12, and 14 families predominate in the peripheral blood (PB) of CML patients. The enhanced expression of the Vbeta 9 and 20 families has been detected in IFN-alpha responsive patients but not patients who are poorly responsive to this agent. This suggests that expansion of T cells expressing these TCR Vbeta gene families may serve as a prognostic factors of the clinical responsiveness of CML patients to IFN-alpha. In addition, since T cell clones that express certain Vbeta families may react with a discrete set of antigenic peptides presented on the surface of malignant cells, a better understanding of the immunobiology of T cells in CML may allow for the design of increasing efficacious immune therapy for this disease.","['Fujii, S']",['Fujii S'],"['The Center for Bone Marrow Transplantation and Immunotherapy, Institute for Clinical Research, Kumamoto National Hospital, Japan. fujii1018@aol.com']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,IM,"['Antigen Presentation', 'Cell Differentiation/immunology', 'Humans', '*Immunotherapy', 'Interferon-alpha/*immunology/therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*immunology/pathology/*therapy', 'Major Histocompatibility Complex', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology/pathology']",2000/05/16 09:00,2000/08/01 11:00,['2000/05/16 09:00'],"['2000/05/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/08/01 11:00 [medline]', '2000/05/16 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.3109/10428190009060316 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2000 Jun;38(1-2):21-38. doi: 10.3109/10428190009060316.,['0 (Interferon-alpha)'],138,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Previous studies demonstrated that the physiological surveillance function performed by von Willebrand factor (vWF) could be incorporated into retroviral vectors by molecular engineering of the MuLV ecotropic envelope (Env) protein. To advance the application of vWF targeting technology beyond laboratory animals, we prepared an extensive series of Env proteins bearing modified vWF-derived matrix-binding sequences and assembled these chimeric proteins into targeted vectors that are capable of transducing human cells. Initially, a dual envelope configuration was utilized, which required coexpression of a wild-type amphotropic Env. Subsequently, streamlined ""escort"" Env proteins were constructed wherein the inoperative receptor-binding domain of the targeting partner was replaced by the vWF-derived collagen-binding motif. Ultimately, an optimal construct was developed that exhibited properties of both extracellular matrix (ECM)-targeting and near wild-type amphotropic infectivity, and could be arrayed as a single envelope on a retroviral particle. On intraarterial instillation, enhanced focal transduction of neointimal cells (approximately 20%) was demonstrated in a rat model of balloon angioplasty. Moreover, transduction of tumor foci (approximately 1-3%) was detected after portal vein infusion of a matrix-targeted vector in a nude mouse model of liver metastasis. We conclude that the unique properties of these targeted injectable retroviral vectors would be suitable for improving therapeutic gene delivery in numerous clinical applications, including vascular restenosis, laser and other surgical procedures, orthopedic injuries, wound healing, ischemia, arthritis, inflammatory disease, and metastatic cancer.","['Hall, F L', 'Liu, L', 'Zhu, N L', 'Stapfer, M', 'Anderson, W F', 'Beart, R W', 'Gordon, E M']","['Hall FL', 'Liu L', 'Zhu NL', 'Stapfer M', 'Anderson WF', 'Beart RW', 'Gordon EM']","['Department of Colorectal Surgery, Keck School of Medicine of the University of Southern California, Los Angeles 90089, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Hum Gene Ther,Human gene therapy,9008950,IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Carotid Artery Injuries/therapy', 'Cell Line', 'Drug Carriers', 'Extracellular Matrix/*metabolism', 'Gene Products, env/*genetics', 'Genetic Therapy/*methods', 'Genetic Vectors/genetics/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/genetics', 'Liver Neoplasms/pathology/therapy', 'Mice', 'Mice, Nude', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Pancreatic Neoplasms/secondary', 'Rats', 'Rats, Wistar', 'Recombinant Proteins/genetics/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Transduction, Genetic', 'von Willebrand Factor/*genetics/metabolism/*pharmacology']",2000/05/16 09:00,2000/08/01 11:00,['2000/05/16 09:00'],"['2000/05/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/08/01 11:00 [medline]', '2000/05/16 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1089/10430340050015293 [doi]'],ppublish,Hum Gene Ther. 2000 May 1;11(7):983-93. doi: 10.1089/10430340050015293.,"['0 (Drug Carriers)', '0 (Gene Products, env)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (von Willebrand Factor)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We used this model to compare xenotransplantability of human leukemia and lymphoma cell lines and to investigate angiogenesis in hematopoietic malignancies. Ten of 12 evaluated cell lines were able to engraft NOD/SCID mice within 120 days. A strong correlation was observed between the amount of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) produced in vitro by cultured cells and the efficiency of tumor engraftment (r = 0.808; P = 0.001), and an inverse correlation was found between VEGF production and the time of tumor engraftment (r = -0.792; P = 0.006) and between VEGF production and the frequency of apoptotic/dead cells in solid tumors (r = -0.892; P = 0.007). Moreover, VEGF production correlated with the frequency of endothelial (CD31+/CD34+) cells in solid tumors (r = 0.897; P = 0.001). Taken together with in vitro data presented here and indicating that the VEGF antagonist Flt-1/Fc chimera inhibits leukemia and lymphoma cell proliferation, our findings support a role for tumor-derived VEGF in leukemia and lymphoma progression. Furthermore, the present study confirms previous observations indicating that VEGF expression may play a crucial role in xenotransplantability of human solid malignancies in SCID mice. The NOD/SCID model is promising for future evaluations of antiangiogenic drugs, alone or in combination with established chemo- or immunotherapy regimens.","['Fusetti, L', 'Pruneri, G', 'Gobbi, A', 'Rabascio, C', 'Carboni, N', 'Peccatori, F', 'Martinelli, G', 'Bertolini, F']","['Fusetti L', 'Pruneri G', 'Gobbi A', 'Rabascio C', 'Carboni N', 'Peccatori F', 'Martinelli G', 'Bertolini F']","['Division of Hematology-Oncology, IRCCS European Institute of Oncology, Milan, Italy.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Aged', 'Animals', '*Apoptosis', 'Bone Marrow/blood supply', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Endothelial Growth Factors/antagonists & inhibitors/*biosynthesis', 'Female', 'Fibroblast Growth Factor 2/biosynthesis', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/metabolism/*pathology', 'Lymphokines/antagonists & inhibitors/*biosynthesis', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/metabolism/pathology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mice, SCID', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Neovascularization, Pathologic/metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factors']",2000/05/16 09:00,2000/06/03 09:00,['2000/05/16 09:00'],"['2000/05/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/06/03 09:00 [medline]', '2000/05/16 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 2000 May 1;60(9):2527-34.,"['0 (Endothelial Growth Factors)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A)', '0 (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factors)', '103107-01-3 (Fibroblast Growth Factor 2)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The results were correlated to individual liver iron concentrations, measured non-invasively by superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) biomagnetometry. A close correlation between serum concentrations of ferritin protein and ferritin iron was found (r = 0.92) in all groups of patients. However, the correlation between ferritin iron concentration and individual liver iron concentration was poor in patients with hemochromatosis (r = 0.63) and patients with beta-thalassemia major (r = 0.57). The degree of ferritin iron saturation was about 5% in iron-loaded patients, which contrasts with results in two recent studies but confirms older observations. In patients with liver cell damage, the ferritin iron saturation in serum was significantly higher than that found in groups with iron overload disease, probably indicating the release of intracellular iron-rich ferritin into the blood. The monitoring of patients undergoing bone marrow transplantation indicated that the release of iron-rich and iron-poor ferritin occurred during phases of hepatocellular damage and inflammation, respectively. We find the benefits of serum ferritin iron measurement to be marginal in patients with iron overload disease.","['Nielsen, P', 'Gunther, U', 'Durken, M', 'Fischer, R', 'Dullmann, J']","['Nielsen P', 'Gunther U', 'Durken M', 'Fischer R', 'Dullmann J']","['Department of Molecular Cell Biology, University Hospital of the University of Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Lab Clin Med,The Journal of laboratory and clinical medicine,0375375,IM,"['Adult', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Child', 'Ferritins/*blood', 'Hemochromatosis/*blood/diagnosis/genetics/therapy', 'Hepatitis C/blood/complications/diagnosis', 'Heterozygote', 'Homozygote', 'Humans', 'Iron/*analysis/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/blood/therapy', 'Liver/*metabolism/pathology', 'Liver Diseases/*blood/diagnosis/therapy', 'Middle Aged', 'Outpatients', 'Phlebotomy', 'Spectrophotometry, Atomic', 'beta-Thalassemia/blood/diagnosis/virology']",2000/05/16 09:00,2000/06/03 09:00,['2000/05/16 09:00'],"['2000/05/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/06/03 09:00 [medline]', '2000/05/16 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0022-2143(00)53650-6 [pii]', '10.1067/mlc.2000.106456 [doi]']",ppublish,J Lab Clin Med. 2000 May;135(5):413-8. doi: 10.1067/mlc.2000.106456.,"['9007-73-2 (Ferritins)', 'E1UOL152H7 (Iron)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, it was still unclear how this activation occurs and what the molecular identity of the H2O2-stimulated PLD isozyme is. This study shows that H2O2 potently increases the PLD activity in mouse lymphocytic leukemic L1210 cells, which contain exclusively PLD2. In addition, H2O2 increased PLD activity only in PLD2-transfected COS-7 cells and not in PLD1-transfected cells. This suggests that PLD2 is selectively activated by H2O2. Depletion of extracellular Ca2+ with EGTA completely blocked the H2O2-induced PLD activation, indicating that Ca2+ influx is required. Moreover, pretreatment of the cells with the protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitors GF-109203X and RO-31-8220 and down-regulation of PKCalpha by prolonged treatment with 4beta-phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate inhibited the H2O2-stimulated PLD2 activity, which points to the involvement of PKCalpha. Based on these new findings we suggest that PLD2 activity is specifically up-regulated by H2O2 and that the H2O2-induced PLD2 activation is mediated by Ca2+ influx and PKCalpha activation.","['Lee, B D', 'Kim, J H', 'Lee, S D', 'Kim, Y', 'Suh, P G', 'Ryu, S H']","['Lee BD', 'Kim JH', 'Lee SD', 'Kim Y', 'Suh PG', 'Ryu SH']","['Department of Life Science and School of Environmental Engineering, Pohang University of Science and Technology, Korea.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Leukoc Biol,Journal of leukocyte biology,8405628,IM,"['Animals', 'COS Cells', 'Calcium/physiology', 'Edetic Acid/pharmacology', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Hydrogen Peroxide/*pharmacology', 'Indoles/pharmacology', 'Isoenzymes/metabolism', 'K562 Cells', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia L1210/*enzymology', 'Maleimides/pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Phospholipase D/genetics/*metabolism', 'Protein Kinase C/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Protein Kinase C-alpha', 'Recombinant Proteins/metabolism', 'Transfection', 'U937 Cells']",2000/05/16 09:00,2000/06/03 09:00,['2000/05/16 09:00'],"['2000/05/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/06/03 09:00 [medline]', '2000/05/16 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/jlb.67.5.630 [doi]'],ppublish,J Leukoc Biol. 2000 May;67(5):630-6. doi: 10.1002/jlb.67.5.630.,"['0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Indoles)', '0 (Isoenzymes)', '0 (Maleimides)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '9G34HU7RV0 (Edetic Acid)', 'BBX060AN9V (Hydrogen Peroxide)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (PRKCA protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Prkca protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C-alpha)', 'EC 3.1.4.- (phospholipase D2)', 'EC 3.1.4.4 (Phospholipase D)', 'L79H6N0V6C (bisindolylmaleimide I)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)', 'W9A0B5E78O (Ro 31-8220)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

MTX deprives rapidly dividing cells of reduced folates that are necessary for thymidylate synthesis and de novo purine nucleotide synthesis. However, MTX toxicity can be circumvented by salvaging thymidine (TdR) and purine nucleosides. Here we have investigated conditions under which nucleoside transport inhibition can be used to maintain differential MTX toxicity between unmodified cells and cells expressing drug-resistant DHFR activity in the presence of exogenous nucleosides. PA317 cells (a 3T3 derivative cell line) were rescued from the toxicity of 0.1 microM MTX by 1.0 microM TdR in the presence of 100 microM inosine. The nucleoside transport inhibitor dipyridamole (DP) resensitized these cells to MTX, even in the presence of exogenous nucleosides. Furthermore, PA317 cells transduced with any of three retroviruses encoding drug-resistant DHFRs remained resistant to MTX over all concentrations tested (up to 10.0 microM) in the presence of DP. Similar results were obtained in transduced HuH7 and K562 cell lines, a human hepatoma and a human leukemia cell line, respectively. We conclude that nucleoside transport inhibition increases the toxicity and selectivity of MTX in cultured cells, and therefore is an effective way to maintain differential MTX toxicity between unmodified and DHFR-modified cells. Our results support the use of nucleoside transport inhibition in in vivo selection protocols involving the liver and hematopoietic systems.","['Warlick, C A', 'Sweeney, C L', 'McIvor, R S']","['Warlick CA', 'Sweeney CL', 'McIvor RS']","['Institute of Human Genetics, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis 55455, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Biochem Pharmacol,Biochemical pharmacology,0101032,IM,"['3T3 Cells', 'Animals', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/*toxicity', 'Carrier Proteins/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Dipyridamole/pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*physiology', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Membrane Proteins/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Methotrexate/*pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Nucleoside Transport Proteins', 'Nucleosides/*metabolism', 'Phosphodiesterase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Tetrahydrofolate Dehydrogenase/drug effects/genetics/*metabolism']",2000/05/16 09:00,2000/07/06 11:00,['2000/05/16 09:00'],"['2000/05/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/07/06 11:00 [medline]', '2000/05/16 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-2952(99)00311-1 [pii]', '10.1016/s0006-2952(99)00311-1 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Pharmacol. 2000 Jan 15;59(2):141-51. doi: 10.1016/s0006-2952(99)00311-1.,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Nucleoside Transport Proteins)', '0 (Nucleosides)', '0 (Phosphodiesterase Inhibitors)', '64ALC7F90C (Dipyridamole)', 'EC 1.5.1.3 (Tetrahydrofolate Dehydrogenase)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",,,,"['CA60803/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA63916/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'HD32652/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Didemnin B, a marine cyclic depsipeptide, displays interesting biological properties: antiviral activity, inhibition of DNA, RNA and protein synthesis, initiation of apoptosis and ability to block the cell cycle. As very little is known about its mode of action, we studied the effect of increasing doses of Didemnin B on sensitive and resistant human leukemic lymphoblast cell lines. The fluorescence of living cells simultaneously stained with Hoechst 33,342, Rhodamine 123 and Nile Red, were analyzed in a multiparametric approach involving multiwavelength microfluorometry. High concentrations of Didemnin B induced, in the sensitive cell line, a very early decrease in the energetic state of the mitochondria that occurs before a significant decrease of nuclear DNA content, observed simultaneously on sensitive and resistant cells, that could be related to an apoptosis process. Furthermore low Didemnin doses (50 nM) affected CEM-WT and CEM VLB differently, while higher doses (200 nM-250 nM and over) affected the two cell lines in the same way. This indicated that, at these doses, the membranar Pgp has no effect on the mode of action of Didemnin, suggesting that Didemnin does not need to be internalized to be active.","['Rocchi, E', 'Vigo, J', 'Viallet, P', 'Bonnard, I', 'Salmon, J M']","['Rocchi E', 'Vigo J', 'Viallet P', 'Bonnard I', 'Salmon JM']","['Laboratory of Physico-Chemical Biology of Integrated Systems, University of Perpignan, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Greece,Anticancer Res,Anticancer research,8102988,IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*toxicity', 'Benzimidazoles', 'Cell Division/*drug effects', '*Depsipeptides', '*Drug Resistance, Multiple', 'Fluorescent Dyes', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Microscopy, Video', 'Oxazines', 'Peptides, Cyclic/*toxicity', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma', 'Rhodamine 123', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Vinblastine/toxicity']",2000/05/16 09:00,2000/06/03 09:00,['2000/05/16 09:00'],"['2000/05/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/06/03 09:00 [medline]', '2000/05/16 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Anticancer Res. 2000 Mar-Apr;20(2A):987-96.,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzimidazoles)', '0 (Depsipeptides)', '0 (Fluorescent Dyes)', '0 (Oxazines)', '0 (Peptides, Cyclic)', '1N3CZ14C5O (Rhodamine 123)', '4LSZ9C5HOB (didemnins)', '5V9KLZ54CY (Vinblastine)', 'P476F1L81G (nile red)', 'P976261J69 (bisbenzimide ethoxide trihydrochloride)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

DZ-3358 induced the mitotic arrest of P388 murine leukemia cells at 0.4 microgram/ml in a time-dependent manner, and inhibited porcine tubulin polymerization. Furthermore, using immunofluorescence techniques, we observed microtubule formation in NUGC-3 human gastric cancer cells treated with DZ-3358. Microtubule formation was disordered, similar to that which occurred when such cells were treated with colchicine. These findings suggest that the mechanism of the anti-proliferative effect of DZ-3358 is the inhibition of mitosis due to the blocking of tubulin polymerization. The differential pattern of growth inhibitory concentrations of DZ-3358 against a series of cancer cell lines was compared with that of colchicine and vincristine, and no correlation was found with the pattern of these two drugs.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: The telomerase activity was determined by TRAP assay. Using TaqMan RT-PCR, the quantitative and kinetic values of mRNA expression of the three telomerase-associated molecules were examined in HL60 cells differentiated with tumor necrosis factor mutant and all-transretinoic acid. RESULTS: The levels of telomerase activity in leukemic cell lines, leukemic cells from patients, and normal peripheral blood cells were distributed over a very wide range. Human telomerase catalytic subunit (hTERT) mRNA expression declined to nearly undetectable levels more rapidly than the inhibition of telomerase activity after treatment with these reagents in HL60 cells. Telomerase-associated protein (TEP1) mRNA increased approximately 6-fold over its level in untreated cells. The levels of human telomerase RNA component (hTERC) also increased approximately 2.7-fold at 5 days after treatment. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that telomerase activity is down-regulated mainly via decreases in hTERT, but not TEP1 and hTERC expression during the differentiation of leukemic cells.","['Koyanagi, Y', 'Kobayashi, D', 'Yajima, T', 'Asanuma, K', 'Kimura, T', 'Sato, T', 'Kida, T', 'Yagihashi, A', 'Kameshima, H', 'Watanabe, N']","['Koyanagi Y', 'Kobayashi D', 'Yajima T', 'Asanuma K', 'Kimura T', 'Sato T', 'Kida T', 'Yagihashi A', 'Kameshima H', 'Watanabe N']","['Department of Laboratory Diagnosis, Sapporo Medical University, School of Medicine, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Greece,Anticancer Res,Anticancer research,8102988,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Aged', 'Carrier Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Catalytic Domain', 'Cell Differentiation', 'DNA-Binding Proteins', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, B-Cell', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/blood/*enzymology/genetics', 'Leukemia, T-Cell', 'Leukocytes/enzymology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/blood/*enzymology/genetics', 'RNA/*genetics/metabolism', 'RNA, Long Noncoding', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', '*RNA, Untranslated', 'RNA-Binding Proteins', 'Telomerase/*genetics/*metabolism', '*Transcription, Genetic', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'U937 Cells']",2000/05/16 09:00,2000/06/03 09:00,['2000/05/16 09:00'],"['2000/05/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/06/03 09:00 [medline]', '2000/05/16 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Anticancer Res. 2000 Mar-Apr;20(2A):773-8.,"['0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Long Noncoding)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Untranslated)', '0 (RNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (TEP1 protein, human)', '0 (telomerase RNA)', '63231-63-0 (RNA)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (Telomerase)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Skeletal muscle myogenesis can be induced in vitro, resulting in the fusion of mononucleate myoblasts to form multinucleate myotubes, and delivery vectors are first tested in vitro. C2C12 myoblasts transfected with pcDNA3-GH, which used the human cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter, secreted immunoreactive GH with comparable biological activity to pituitary GH. Mouse myeloid leukaemia cells, which express the mouse GH receptor were used for the bioassay, and activation of these cells by GH was measured by a colorimetric microculture tetrazolium assay. Cells were incubated with a tetrazolium salt (MTS) and an intermediate electron acceptor (phenazine methosulphate, PMS), and formazan production was measured as optical density (O.D.) at 490 nm. The efficiencies of several plasmid expression vectors were compared in differentiated and non-differentiated muscle cells, as a function of bioactive GH secreted by the transfected cells. Ten-day differentiated C2C12 myotubes transfected with pcDNA3E-GH, which used the CMV promoter and a rat myosin light chain enhancer element, secreted significantly more biologically active GH than myotubes transfected with pcDNA3-GH (0.82 O.D. units+/-0.06 vs 0.57+/-0.05 respectively, P<0.001). This was consistent with reduced CMV promoter activity in myotubes. Myoblasts transfected with pcDNA3-GH secreted more bioactive GH than 10-day transfected myotubes (1.1+/-0. 1 vs 0.77+/-0.07 respectively). However, the responses were indistinguishable (both 1.0+/-0.09) if both the myotubes and myoblasts had been transfected with pcDNA3E-GH. Substitution of the vector pMHLC-GH, which used a muscle-specific truncated rabbit myosin heavy chain promoter, and the myosin enhancer resulted in a marked decrease in the responses to the conditioned medium from fused myotubes compared with the vectors pcDNA3-GH and pcDNA3E-GH (0. 24+/-0.02 vs 0.57+/-0.05 vs 0.82+/-0.06 respectively).

METHODS: All workers were employed at company production and pipeline locations sometime during 1946-94. The cohort now consists of 24 124 employees with an average of 22 years of follow up. RESULTS: The overall mortality, and most cause specific mortalities were lower than or similar to those for the general United States population. For white men (81% of the cohort), there were 4361 observed deaths and 5945 expected, resulting in a significantly lower standardised mortality ratio (SMR) of 73. There were significant deficits for all the leading causes of death in the United States including all cancers, cancer of the lung, stroke, heart disease, respiratory disease, and accidents. Slightly increased mortality was found for cancer of the prostate, cancer of the brain and central nervous system, and cancer of other lymphatic tissue. For benign and unspecified neoplasms, the SMR was 152 (95% confidence interval (95% CI) 95 to 230). There was a significant increase for acute myelogenous leukaemia that was restricted to people who were first employed before 1940 and who were employed in production and pipeline jobs for >30 years. Overall mortality patterns for non-white men and women were similar to those for white men. Mortality patterns for white men were also examined by duration of employment, time first employed, and by job group.

This has been noticed in specific cases of acute myeloid leukaemia, where the 16p13 breakpoint affects the expression of the multidrug resistance related protein (MRP). Myxoid liposarcomas (LPS) are characterized by the t(12; 16)(q13; p11), which leads to the formation of a FUS-CHOP fusion transcript. This study investigates the relationship between the cytogenetically detected breakpoint 16p11 in myxoid LPS, the presence of the FUS-CHOP fusion transcript in nonmyxoid LPS and the expression of the lung resistance major vault protein (LRP) gene on 16p11.2. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Of 16 cases with a diagnosis of a (possible) liposarcoma with an abnormal karyotype, fresh frozen tumour material was available for immunohistological detection of LRP. Cases without a cytogenetically detected t(12; 16)(q13; p11), were analyzed for the presence of a FUS-CHOP fusion transcript by RT-PCR. RESULTS: In all 9 myxoid LPS a t(12; 16)(q13; p11) was found and LRP expression was absent or low. In none of the remaining 7 cases was a FUS-CHOP fusion transcript found, and four tumours were LRP positive (P = 0. 02).

Paraffin-sections from 56 cases of HL (18 nodular sclerosis and 38 mixed cellularity) and from ten ""reactive"" lymph nodes were investigated. P53, p21, bcl-2, bax, Rb and Ki67 proteins were detected in Hodgkin and Reed-Sternberg (HRS) cells in 35/56, 56/56, 24/56, 23/56, 56/56 and 56/56 cases of HL, respectively. No correlation was found between the expression of each protein and the EBV status or the histotype of HL. Comparison between p53 and p21 staining revealed two patterns: a) p53+/p21+ (35 cases); and b) p53-/p21+ (21 cases). The pattern p53+/p21+ suggests wild type p53 protein able to induce the expression of p21 while the p53-/p21+ pattern suggests p53-independent p21 expression. These results are consistent with the interpretation that inactivating p53 gene mutations may be rare in HL. Comparison between bcl-2 and bax staining showed a statistically significant relationship (p<0.001) for coexpression (19 cases) or absence of expression of both proteins (28 cases) in HRS cells. In contrast, bax expression was observed in most lymphoid cells in all ""reactive"" lymph nodes. Since the proapoptotic bax protein may act as tumour suppressor it is possible that the absence of this protein in HRS cells in a substantial proportion of HL may confer growth advantage and play a role in their pathogenesis. This could suggest bax gene alterations in some HL since in other studies acute lymphoblastic leukaemia cell lines demonstrate bax gene mutations with loss of bax immunoexpression. Another possibility is that reduced bax expression may be due to post transcriptional regulation, as was described in lymphoma cell lines. Comparison between Rb and Ki67 staining disclosed two main deviations from the normal parallel relationship in reactive lymph nodes: a) 2 cases with low Rb and high Ki67 expression possibly reflecting loss of Rb expression due to chromosome loss or to other abnormalities in the structure or the expression of Rb gene; and b) 9 cases with high RB and low Ki67 possible reflecting an attempt of Rb protein in excess to induce cell cycle arrest. Taken together, our findings provide combined immunohistological evidence for deregulated expression of cell-cycle and apoptosis-related proteins, that may play a role in the pathogenesis of HL.","['Kanavaros, P', 'Stefanaki, K', 'Vlachonikolis, J', 'Eliopoulos, G', 'Kakolyris, S', 'Rontogianni, D', 'Gorgoulis, V', 'Georgoulias, V']","['Kanavaros P', 'Stefanaki K', 'Vlachonikolis J', 'Eliopoulos G', 'Kakolyris S', 'Rontogianni D', 'Gorgoulis V', 'Georgoulias V']","['Department of Histology, University of Thessalia, Athens, Greece.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Spain,Histol Histopathol,Histology and histopathology,8609357,IM,"['Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21', 'Cyclins/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Herpesvirus 4, Human/metabolism', 'Hodgkin Disease/*metabolism/pathology/virology', 'Humans', 'Ki-67 Antigen/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'RNA, Viral/biosynthesis', 'Retinoblastoma Protein/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Viral Matrix Proteins/biosynthesis', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein']",2000/05/16 09:00,2000/07/15 11:00,['2000/05/16 09:00'],"['2000/05/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/07/15 11:00 [medline]', '2000/05/16 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.14670/HH-15.445 [doi]'],ppublish,Histol Histopathol. 2000 Apr;15(2):445-53. doi: 10.14670/HH-15.445.,"['0 (BAX protein, human)', '0 (CDKN1A protein, human)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21)', '0 (Cyclins)', '0 (EBV-associated membrane antigen, Epstein-Barr virus)', '0 (Epstein-Barr virus encoded RNA 1)', '0 (Epstein-Barr virus encoded RNA 2)', '0 (Ki-67 Antigen)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (RNA, Viral)', '0 (Retinoblastoma Protein)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '0 (Viral Matrix Proteins)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)']",,,,,,,,,10.14670/HH-15.445 [doi],,,,,,,,,,,

It remains unclear whether there is a direct linkage between apoptosis and telomerase activity particularly in transformed cell lines. In the present study, we investigated the telomerase activities in three leukemic cell lines (HL-60, U937 and K562) after treating these cells with various doses of antitumor drugs, puromycin or actinomycin D (ActD). Our results showed that HL-60 cells underwent apoptosis rapidly when treated with either 20 microg/ml of puromycin or 5 microg/ml of Act D with more than 60% of the cells becoming apoptotic at 6 hrs and almost 100% at 12 hrs. But telomerase activity analyzed by TRAP assay in these apoptotic cells remained unchanged as compared with the untreated control cells suggesting that whether the cells were apoptotic or not, it had no effect on telomerase activity. However, if lower dosages of the drugs were used, that is, 0.5-1.5 microg/ml of puromycin or 0.01-0.5 microg/ml of Act D, a decrease in telomerase activity was observed at 24-48 hrs, and was completely undetectable at 72 hrs. This decrease in telomerase activity was dose- and time-dependent. The suppression of telomerase activity by low doses of these two drugs is probably due to the inhibitory effect of the drugs on protein translation or RNA transcription rather than direct inhibition of the telomerase activity. Flow cytometry analysis of the cell cycle of the drug-treated cells showed that these drugs unselectively induced apoptosis at all phases of the cell cycle and was unrelated to the changes in telomerase activity. Similar results were observed in U937 and K562 cells except that K562 cells underwent apoptosis more slowly than the former two cell lines.","['Zhang, J X', 'Zhang, Z K', 'Sheng, H P', 'Tsao, S W', 'Loh, T T']","['Zhang JX', 'Zhang ZK', 'Sheng HP', 'Tsao SW', 'Loh TT']","['Department of Physiology, Faculty of Medicine, The University of Hong Kong, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Life Sci,Life sciences,0375521,IM,"['Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects/*physiology', 'DNA Fragmentation/drug effects', 'Dactinomycin/pharmacology', 'Down-Regulation/drug effects', 'Flow Cytometry', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia/enzymology/*pathology', 'Puromycin/pharmacology', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Telomerase/*metabolism', 'U937 Cells']",2000/05/16 09:00,2000/05/20 09:00,['2000/05/16 09:00'],"['2000/05/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/05/20 09:00 [medline]', '2000/05/16 09:00 [entrez]']","['S002432050000494X [pii]', '10.1016/s0024-3205(00)00494-x [doi]']",ppublish,Life Sci. 2000 Mar 24;66(18):1713-23. doi: 10.1016/s0024-3205(00)00494-x.,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '1CC1JFE158 (Dactinomycin)', '4A6ZS6Q2CL (Puromycin)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (Telomerase)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

One cannot definitively rule out an association, however, because of the methodologic limitations, such as small numbers of exposed cases and lack of detailed exposure information.

In vitro data suggest that immunotherapeutic cytokines such as interleukin-2 (IL-2) or interferon-alpha (IFN-alpha) only weakly activate T cells or natural killer (NK) cells in a reconstituted environment of oxidative stress and that inhibitors of the formation of ROS or scavengers of ROS synergize with IL-2 and IFN-alpha to activate T cells and NK cells. In this review, we focus on the immunoenhancing properties of histamine, a biogenic amine. Histamine inhibits ROS formation in MO via H2-receptors; thereby, histamine protects NK cells from MO-mediated inhibition and synergizes with IL-2 and IFN-alpha to induce killing of NK cell-sensitive human tumor cells in vitro. Histamine also optimizes cytokine-induced activation of several subsets of T cells by affording protection against MO-inflicted oxidative inhibition. The putative clinical benefit of histamine as an adjunct to immunotherapy with IL-2 and/or IFN-alpha is currently evaluated in clinical trials in metastatic malignant melanoma and acute myelogenous leukemia.","['Hellstrand, K', 'Brune, M', 'Naredi, P', 'Mellqvist, U H', 'Hansson, M', 'Gehlsen, K R', 'Hermodsson, S']","['Hellstrand K', 'Brune M', 'Naredi P', 'Mellqvist UH', 'Hansson M', 'Gehlsen KR', 'Hermodsson S']","['Department of Virology, University of Goteborg, Sweden. kristoffer.hellstrand@microbio.gu.se']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Cancer Invest,Cancer investigation,8307154,IM,"['Drug Therapy, Combination', 'Histamine/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', '*Immunotherapy', 'Interferon-gamma/*therapeutic use', 'Interleukin-2/*therapeutic use', 'Lymphocytes, Tumor-Infiltrating/immunology', 'Neoplasms/*therapy', 'Oxidative Stress', 'Reactive Oxygen Species', 'Receptors, Histamine/physiology']",2000/05/16 09:00,2000/06/03 09:00,['2000/05/16 09:00'],"['2000/05/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/06/03 09:00 [medline]', '2000/05/16 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.3109/07357900009012178 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Invest. 2000;18(4):347-55. doi: 10.3109/07357900009012178.,"['0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '0 (Receptors, Histamine)', '820484N8I3 (Histamine)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)']",56,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, little is known about effects of BMT from patients with IEM donating for non-affected recipients. We present data from a 8.5-year-old girl who underwent BMT in second remission for relapsed acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) at the age of 7 years from her HLA-identical brother who was severely affected by Hunter syndrome (Mucopolysaccharidosis type II, iduronate-2-sulphatase (IDS) deficiency). After BMT not only leukocyte but also plasma activity of IDS was absent. Mixing experiments and immunoadsorption suggest antibody-mediated enzyme inhibition. However, her urinary glycosaminoglycan excretion has not increased post BMT and clinical signs of mucopolysaccharidosis are absent 20 months after BMT. We conclude that patients with white cell enzyme deficiencies and other IEMs do not have to be excluded from bone marrow donation. Antibody production by the graft may occur and be reflected by a marked reduction in plasma enzyme levels but not tissue activity. Similar antibody responses resulting in enzyme inactivation might also affect other enzyme replacement strategies for individuals with IEM.","['Meyer, S', 'Thornley, M', 'Wynn, R F', 'Brennan, B M', 'Carr, T', 'Wraith, J E', 'Will, A M']","['Meyer S', 'Thornley M', 'Wynn RF', 'Brennan BM', 'Carr T', 'Wraith JE', 'Will AM']","[""Bone Marrow Transplant Unit and Department of Oncology, Royal Manchester Children's Hospital, Manchester, UK.""]",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",England,Bone Marrow Transplant,Bone marrow transplantation,8702459,IM,"['Acute Disease', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Child', 'Female', 'Glycosaminoglycans/urine', 'Graft Survival', 'Humans', 'Iduronate Sulfatase/blood/immunology', 'Isoantibodies/blood', 'Leukemia/*therapy', 'Metabolism, Inborn Errors/*blood', 'Mucopolysaccharidosis II/blood', 'Nuclear Family', 'Tissue Donors']",2000/05/16 09:00,2000/06/24 11:00,['2000/05/16 09:00'],"['2000/05/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/06/24 11:00 [medline]', '2000/05/16 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.bmt.1702333 [doi]'],ppublish,Bone Marrow Transplant. 2000 Apr;25(8):909-11. doi: 10.1038/sj.bmt.1702333.,"['0 (Glycosaminoglycans)', '0 (Isoantibodies)', 'EC 3.1.6.13 (Iduronate Sulfatase)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have prospectively studied the presence of donor- and recipient-derived chimeric cells in bone marrow recipients with pre-B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (pre-B-ALL). The chimeric status of BMT recipients was compared to minimal residual disease (MRD) detection by analysis of immunoglobulin heavy chain (IgH) and T cell receptor (TcR) genes. Post-transplant blood and bone marrow samples from 12 patients with pre-B-ALL were studied. Five patients showed mixed chimerism (MC) in the CD19-positive cell fraction. Four of them have relapsed to date. The remaining patient with MC in the B cell lineage was also MRD positive in the same samples. All seven patients with donor chimerism in the B cell fraction remain in clinical remission (P = 0.01). In samples from all five patients having MC in the B cell lineage, the patient-specific IgH or TcR rearrangement was also detected. In three of four patients who relapsed, MC in the B cell lineage was seen more than 2.5 months prior to morphologically verified relapse. The results of this comparison suggest that routinely performed MC analysis of the affected cell lineage may facilitate post-BMT monitoring and rapid therapeutic decisions in transplanted patients with pre-B-ALL.","['Zetterquist, H', 'Mattsson, J', 'Uzunel, M', 'Nasman-Bjork, I', 'Svenberg, P', 'Tammik, L', 'Bayat, G', 'Winiarski, J', 'Ringden, O']","['Zetterquist H', 'Mattsson J', 'Uzunel M', 'Nasman-Bjork I', 'Svenberg P', 'Tammik L', 'Bayat G', 'Winiarski J', 'Ringden O']","['Department of Surgery, Karolinska Institute at Huddinge Hospital, Huddinge, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Bone Marrow Transplant,Bone marrow transplantation,8702459,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antigens, CD19/blood', 'B-Lymphocytes/*cytology/immunology', 'Biomarkers', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Cell Lineage', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'DNA/blood', 'DNA Primers', 'Female', 'Genes, T-Cell Receptor delta', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/genetics', 'Immunomagnetic Separation', 'Male', 'Minisatellite Repeats', 'Neoplasm, Residual/*blood/genetics', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*blood', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*blood', 'Prospective Studies', 'Recurrence', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA', 'Transplantation Chimera/*genetics']",2000/05/16 09:00,2000/06/24 11:00,['2000/05/16 09:00'],"['2000/05/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/06/24 11:00 [medline]', '2000/05/16 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.bmt.1702337 [doi]'],ppublish,Bone Marrow Transplant. 2000 Apr;25(8):843-51. doi: 10.1038/sj.bmt.1702337.,"['0 (Antigens, CD19)', '0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we reviewed the pre- and post-transplant bone marrow biopsies (BMB) of 40 acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) patients autografted in our center, 28 with normal and 12 with delayed peripheral recovery. The two groups were comparable in terms of previous therapy, disease phase and the number of infused cells, and received the same conditioning regimen. In the former group, reduced bone marrow cellularity and mild reticulin abnormalities were usual histological findings; in the latter, five patients had the same pattern, but the other seven had an almost undetectable hematopoietic parenchyma and severe reticulin derangement. One of these seven patients died of reactivated hepatitis B virus infection; the others eventually achieved peripheral recovery, with none of them experiencing a relapse. Autografted AML patients are excellent subjects for histological investigations. They account for the majority of delayed engraftments, the contribution of extramedullary components to the timing of engraftment is minimal, and leukemia relapse cannot be ruled out. These results suggest that BMB is a useful investigation in the work-up of late engraftment. A high degree of reticulin derangement with an almost undetectable hematopoietic parenchyma appear to be the morphological hallmarks of late engraftment.","['Annaloro, C', 'Oriani, A', 'Pozzoli, E', 'Deliliers, D L', 'Bertolli, V G', 'Volpe, A D', 'Soligo, D', 'Deliliers, G L']","['Annaloro C', 'Oriani A', 'Pozzoli E', 'Deliliers DL', 'Bertolli VG', 'Volpe AD', 'Soligo D', 'Deliliers GL']","['Centro Trapianti di Midollo, Universita degli Studi di Milano and Ospedale Maggiore di Milano IRCCS, Milan, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",England,Bone Marrow Transplant,Bone marrow transplantation,8702459,IM,"['Adult', 'Biopsy', 'Blood Platelets/cytology', 'Bone Marrow/*pathology', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Cell Count', 'Cell Lineage', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', '*Graft Survival', 'Humans', 'Infections/etiology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/pathology', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/cytology', 'Male', 'Megakaryocytes/pathology', 'Middle Aged', 'Neutrophils/cytology', 'Recurrence', 'Reticulin/ultrastructure', 'Stem Cells/cytology', 'Survival', 'Time Factors', 'Transplantation, Autologous']",2000/05/16 09:00,2000/06/24 11:00,['2000/05/16 09:00'],"['2000/05/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/06/24 11:00 [medline]', '2000/05/16 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.bmt.1702241 [doi]'],ppublish,Bone Marrow Transplant. 2000 Apr;25(8):837-41. doi: 10.1038/sj.bmt.1702241.,['0 (Reticulin)'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Two patients were transplanted with mafosfamide and mafosfamide/amifostine pretreated PBPC autografts. The in vitro experiments demonstrated a significantly higher resistance of peripheral blood derived CFU-GM to mafosfamide (median ID95 190 microg mafosfamide/ml) compared with bone marrow derived CFU-GM (median ID95130 microg/ml). Preincubation with amifostine significantly further increased the median ID95 to 245 microg/ml. The clinical results showed short recovery times for neutrophils >500/microl (9 and 13 days) and platelets >20 000/microl (12 and 21 days) and stable long-term engraftment with one relapse at day +118 and one patient in CR at day 760 after transplantation. The in vitro results show a significant advantage of PBPC over bone marrow-derived progenitors for purging with mafosfamide. Furthermore, a protective effect from mafosfamide of amifostine on normal progenitors could be demonstrated. The clinical results demonstrate the clinical feasibility of using mafosfamide-purged autologous PBPCT without impairing the short-term and long-term repopulating capacities of the autografts.","['Fauth, F', 'Martin, H', 'Sonnhoff, S', 'Bialleck, H', 'Wiesneth, M', 'Mihanovic, B', 'Hoelzer, D']","['Fauth F', 'Martin H', 'Sonnhoff S', 'Bialleck H', 'Wiesneth M', 'Mihanovic B', 'Hoelzer D']","['Klinikum der Johann Wolfgang Goethe Universitat, Dept of Hematology and Oncology, Frankfurt, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",England,Bone Marrow Transplant,Bone marrow transplantation,8702459,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adjuvants, Immunologic', 'Adult', '*Amifostine', 'Bone Marrow/drug effects', '*Bone Marrow Purging/methods', 'Cyclophosphamide/*analogs & derivatives', 'Female', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/*pharmacology', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Mobilization', 'Humans', 'Leukapheresis', 'Leukemia/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Stem Cells/*cytology/drug effects', 'Transplantation, Autologous']",2000/05/16 09:00,2000/06/24 11:00,['2000/05/16 09:00'],"['2000/05/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/06/24 11:00 [medline]', '2000/05/16 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.bmt.1702236 [doi]'],ppublish,Bone Marrow Transplant. 2000 Apr;25(8):831-6. doi: 10.1038/sj.bmt.1702236.,"['0 (Adjuvants, Immunologic)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '5970HH9923 (mafosfamide)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'M487QF2F4V (Amifostine)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The killing of leukemia cells is proportional to the radiation absorbed dose. We studied the feasibility and toxicity of escalating the doses of fractionated TBI above our previous prescription of 13.5 Gy. Sixteen evaluable patients with advanced hematologic malignancies were treated with twice daily TBI using a high-energy source (18-24 MV). The first patient cohort (n = 11) received a total dose of 14.4 Gy in nine fractions, and the second cohort (n = 5) received doses escalated to 15.3 Gy. All patients received high-dose etoposide (60 mg/kg) and allogeneic stem cell transplantation following the TBI. All patients had HLA-identical sibling donors. The median times for neutrophil and platelet engraftment were 13.5 and 12 days, respectively, and did not differ between the two cohorts. All but one patient developed treatment-related grade 3 or 4 mucositis. There were three cases of grade 4 pulmonary toxicity and three cases of grade 4 hepatic toxicity among the 14.4 Gy cohort, and one case each of grade 4 pulmonary and hepatic toxicities among the 15.3 Gy cohort. In most cases comorbid conditions contributed to these toxicities. Two patients had significant GVHD of the GI tract. Six relapses occurred, five (45%) in the 14.4 Gy cohort and one (20%) in the 15.3 Gy cohort. The 100-day treatment-related mortality rates were 9% and 20% for the 14.4 Gy and 15.3 Gy cohorts, respectively, and the median survivals were 226 and 201 days, respectively. We conclude that TBI dose escalation above the previously used 13.5 Gy dose is feasible using a high-energy source and high-dose etoposide. Acute and chronic toxicities were primarily related to GVHD, infection and relapse rather than to TBI.","['Sobecks, R M', 'Daugherty, C K', 'Hallahan, D E', 'Laport, G F', 'Wagner, N D', 'Larson, R A']","['Sobecks RM', 'Daugherty CK', 'Hallahan DE', 'Laport GF', 'Wagner ND', 'Larson RA']","['Section of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Medicine, The University of Chicago, Chicago, IL 60637-1470, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Bone Marrow Transplant,Bone marrow transplantation,8702459,IM,"['Adult', 'Blood Platelets/cytology', 'Cohort Studies', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Etoposide/*therapeutic use/toxicity', 'Female', 'Graft Survival', 'Graft vs Host Disease/etiology', 'Heart Failure/etiology/therapy', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/complications/radiotherapy/*therapy', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Liver/radiation effects', 'Lung/radiation effects', 'Lung Diseases/etiology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mouth Mucosa/radiation effects', 'Neutrophils/cytology', 'Recurrence', 'Stomatitis/drug therapy/etiology', 'Survival', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Whole-Body Irradiation/adverse effects/*methods/standards']",2000/05/16 09:00,2000/06/24 11:00,['2000/05/16 09:00'],"['2000/05/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/06/24 11:00 [medline]', '2000/05/16 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.bmt.1702230 [doi]'],ppublish,Bone Marrow Transplant. 2000 Apr;25(8):807-13. doi: 10.1038/sj.bmt.1702230.,['6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)'],,,,"['CA14599/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA70937/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As a group, the affinities of these compounds for the RFC were approximately 10-fold greater than those of their respective glutamate analogues. These results indicate that, in addition to their previously reported tight binding to dihydrofolate reductase, a property contributing to the high potency of PT523 and its B-ring analogs as inhibitors of tumor cell growth is their strong affinity for the RFC.","['Wright, J E', 'Vaidya, C M', 'Chen, Y', 'Rosowsky, A']","['Wright JE', 'Vaidya CM', 'Chen Y', 'Rosowsky A']","['Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and Department of Biological Chemistry and Molecular Pharmacology, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02115, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Biochem Pharmacol,Biochemical pharmacology,0101032,IM,"['Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/metabolism', 'Antineoplastic Agents/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Biological Transport/drug effects', 'Carrier Proteins/*metabolism', 'Drug Interactions', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Folic Acid Antagonists/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia', '*Membrane Proteins', '*Membrane Transport Proteins', 'Methotrexate/metabolism', 'Ornithine/*analogs & derivatives/chemistry/pharmacology', 'Pterins/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Reduced Folate Carrier Protein', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2000/05/16 09:00,2000/06/24 11:00,['2000/05/16 09:00'],"['2000/05/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/06/24 11:00 [medline]', '2000/05/16 09:00 [entrez]']","['S000629520000294X [pii]', '10.1016/s0006-2952(00)00294-x [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Pharmacol. 2000 Jul 1;60(1):41-6. doi: 10.1016/s0006-2952(00)00294-x.,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Folic Acid Antagonists)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Membrane Transport Proteins)', '0 (Pterins)', '0 (Reduced Folate Carrier Protein)', '0 (SLC19A1 protein, human)', '0 (SLC19A2 protein, human)', '113857-87-7', '(N(alpha)-(4-amino-4-deoxypteroyl)-N(delta)-hemiphthaloyl-L-ornithine)', 'E524N2IXA3 (Ornithine)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",,,,"['CA25934/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA70349/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The virus persists as nonintegrating episomes in human T cells under restricted viral gene expression and without production of virus particles. This study analyzes the behavior of herpesvirus-transformed autologous T cells after reinfusion into the donor under close-to-human experimental conditions. T cells of 5 macaque monkeys were transformed to stable interleukin-2 dependent growth and were intravenously infused into the respective donor. The animals remained healthy, without occurrence of lymphoma or leukemia for an observation period of more than 1 year. Over several months virus genomes were detectable in peripheral blood cells and in cultured T cells by polymerase chain reaction. In naive control animals, a high-dose intravenous infection rapidly induced pleomorphic peripheral T-cell lymphoma.

The mechanism of neutropenia is not known. Normal neutrophil survival is regulated by the Fas-Fas ligand apoptotic system. We hypothesized that neutropenia in LGL leukemia is mediated by dysregulated expression of Fas ligand. Levels of Fas ligand in serum samples from patients with LGL leukemia were measured with a Fas ligand enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The effects of serum from patients with LGL leukemia on apoptosis of normal neutrophils were determined by flow cytometry and morphologic assessment. High levels of circulating Fas ligand were detected in 39 of 44 serum samples from patients with LGL leukemia. In contrast, Fas ligand was undetectable in 10 samples from healthy donors. Serum from the patients triggered apoptosis of normal neutrophils that depended partly on the Fas pathway. Resolution of neutropenia was associated with disappearance or marked reduction in Fas ligand levels in 10 of 11 treated patients. These data suggest that high levels of Fas ligand are a pathogenetic mechanism in human disease.

To determine the molecular basis of resistance to antitumor agent-induced apoptosis, we performed a complementary DNA (cDNA) subtractive hybridization with messenger RNA (mRNA) from human monocytic leukemia U937 and its variant UK711, which is resistant to apoptosis induced by antitumor agents. We found that glyoxalase I (GLO1), an enzyme that detoxifies methylglyoxal, is selectively overexpressed in the apoptosis-resistant UK711 cells. The GLO1 enzyme activity was significantly elevated in UK711 and UK110 cells, another drug-resistant mutant, as well as in K562/ADM, adriamycin-resistant leukemia cells, compared with their parental cells. When overexpressed in human Jurkat cells, GLO1 inhibited etoposide- and adriamycin-induced caspase activation and apoptosis, indicating the involvement of GLO1 in apoptosis suppression caused by these drugs. Moreover, cotreatment with S-p-bromobenzylglutathione cyclopentyl diester (BBGC), a cell-permeable inhibitor of GLO1, enhanced etoposide-induced apoptosis in resistant UK711 cells but not in parental U937 cells. Taken together, these results indicate that GLO1 is a resistant factor to antitumor agent-induced apoptosis in human leukemia cells and that the GLO1 inhibitor could be a drug resistance-reversing agent.","['Sakamoto, H', 'Mashima, T', 'Kizaki, A', 'Dan, S', 'Hashimoto, Y', 'Naito, M', 'Tsuruo, T']","['Sakamoto H', 'Mashima T', 'Kizaki A', 'Dan S', 'Hashimoto Y', 'Naito M', 'Tsuruo T']","['Cancer Chemotherapy Center, Japanese Foundation for Cancer Research, Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis/drug effects/*genetics', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*genetics', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Lactoylglutathione Lyase/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy/*pathology', 'U937 Cells']",2000/05/16 09:00,2000/06/17 09:00,['2000/05/16 09:00'],"['2000/05/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/06/17 09:00 [medline]', '2000/05/16 09:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)64076-9 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 2000 May 15;95(10):3214-8.,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', 'EC 4.4.1.5 (Lactoylglutathione Lyase)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Inactivation of the E-cadherin gene occurs in undifferentiated solid tumors by both genetic and epigenetic mechanisms; however, the role of E-cadherin in hematologic malignancies is only now being recognized. E-cadherin expression is essential for erythroblast and normoblast maturation, yet expression is reduced or absent in leukemic blast cells. This study examined the messenger RNA (mRNA) and protein expression of the E-cadherin gene in bone marrow and blood samples from normal donors and patients with leukemia. We found that all normal donor samples expressed E-cadherin mRNA, whereas both samples of acute myelogenous leukemia and chronic lymphocytic leukemia had a significant reduction or absence of expression. However, normal blast counterparts expressed only a low level of E-cadherin surface protein. Sodium bisulphite genomic sequencing was used to fully characterize the methylation patterns of the CpG island associated with the E-cadherin gene promoter in those samples with matched DNA. All of the normal control samples were essentially unmethylated; however, 14 of 18 (78%) of the leukemia samples had abnormal hypermethylation of the E-cadherin CpG island. In fact both alleles of the E-cadherin gene were often hypermethylated.

Samples were prestimulated on Retronectin-coated dishes and infected with gibbon ape leukemia virus (GALV)-pseudotyped FMEV vectors encoding the enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP). Periodic analyses of bone marrow (BM) from transplanted recipients revealed a sustained engraftment of human hematopoietic cells expressing the EGFP transgene. On average, 33.6% of human CD45(+) cells expressed the transgene 90 to 120 days after transplantation. Moreover, 11.9% of total NOD/SCID BM consisted of human CD45(+) cells expressing the EGFP transgene at this time. The transplantation of purified EGFP(+) cells increased the proportion of CD45(+) cells positive for EGFP expression to 57. 7% at 90 to 120 days after transplantation. At this time, 18.9% and 4.3% of NOD/SCID BM consisted of CD45(+)/EGFP(+) and CD34(+)/EGFP(+) cells, respectively. Interestingly, the transplantation of EGFP(-) cells purified at 24 hours after infection also generated a significant engraftment of CD45(+)/EGFP(+) and CD34(+)/EGFP(+) cells, suggesting that a number of transduced repopulating cells did not express the transgene at that time. Molecular analysis of NOD/SCID BM confirmed the high levels of engraftment of human transduced cells deduced from FACS analysis.

These react with three structurally and functionally related multienzymic complexes, the 2-oxoacid dehydrogenase complexes, but chiefly with the E2 subunit of pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC-E2). Their very dose (95%) and specific association with PBC underpins the autoimmune concept of pathogenesis of that disease, notwithstanding several non-congruent features. Detailed studies, including structural analysis of epitopes, do not disclose how these autoantibodies originate. Their ubiquity in PBC has overshadowed the existence of a second set of relatively PBC-specific autoantibodies to nuclear antigens for which reactants have been cloned and characterized. These include centromeric proteins; proteins of the nuclear pore complex; nuclear dot proteins, which include Sp-100 and the promyelocytic leukemia antigen; and a recently identified autoantigen, SOX13. Certain of these reactants are DNA-binding proteins with transcriptional regulatory activity. Thus serum from individuals with the same clinical syndrome can have autoimmune reactivity to disparate mitochondrial and nuclear constituents in different cellular compartments. Antibody probing of phage displayed random peptide libraries, together with epitope scanning using overlapping sequential octameric peptides from the PDC-E2 sequence, showed that the discontinuous motifs MH, FV(E) and SYP contributed to a predicted conformational antibody epitope in the inner lipoyl domain of PDC-E2.","['Mackay, I R', 'Whittingham, S', 'Fida, S', 'Myers, M', 'Ikuno, N', 'Gershwin, M E', 'Rowley, M J']","['Mackay IR', 'Whittingham S', 'Fida S', 'Myers M', 'Ikuno N', 'Gershwin ME', 'Rowley MJ']","['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Monash University, Clayton, Victoria, Australia. ian.mackay@med.monash.edu.au']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Immunol Rev,Immunological reviews,7702118,IM,"['Acyltransferases/*immunology', 'Adult', 'Amino Acid Motifs', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Antibodies, Anti-Idiotypic/immunology', 'Antibodies, Antinuclear/immunology', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/immunology', 'Antibody Specificity', 'Autoantibodies/*immunology', 'Autoantigens/*immunology', 'Autoimmune Diseases/*immunology', 'Cell Nucleus/immunology', 'Centromere/immunology', 'Dihydrolipoyllysine-Residue Acetyltransferase', 'Epitopes/immunology', 'Female', 'High Mobility Group Proteins/immunology', 'Humans', 'Liver Cirrhosis, Biliary/epidemiology/*immunology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mitochondria, Liver/enzymology/*immunology', 'Models, Molecular', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Nuclear Proteins/immunology', 'Peptides/*immunology', 'Prevalence', 'Pyruvate Dehydrogenase Complex/chemistry/*immunology', 'SOXD Transcription Factors', 'Sex Distribution']",2000/05/12 09:00,2000/08/29 11:01,['2000/05/12 09:00'],"['2000/05/12 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/08/29 11:01 [medline]', '2000/05/12 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1034/j.1600-0528.2002.017410.x [doi]'],ppublish,Immunol Rev. 2000 Apr;174:226-37. doi: 10.1034/j.1600-0528.2002.017410.x.,"['0 (Antibodies, Anti-Idiotypic)', '0 (Antibodies, Antinuclear)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Autoantibodies)', '0 (Autoantigens)', '0 (Epitopes)', '0 (High Mobility Group Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (PDHX protein, human)', '0 (Peptides)', '0 (Pyruvate Dehydrogenase Complex)', '0 (SOX13 protein, human)', '0 (SOXD Transcription Factors)', 'EC 2.3.- (Acyltransferases)', 'EC 2.3.1.- (dihydrolipoamide acyltransferase)', 'EC 2.3.1.12 (Dihydrolipoyllysine-Residue Acetyltransferase)', 'EC 2.3.1.61 (dihydrolipoamide succinyltransferase)']",65,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Genes of interferon system proteins are located at the sites of breakpoints of the structural chromosome aberrations in cancer. Thus, any of them are rearranged or translocated in various tumor types. As the activity of these genes plays a role in cancer development, their rearrangements may be one of the crucial points in the pathogenesis of some cancer types. Besides, they also take part in organism immunity against viral infections. Transfection experiments with IFN system genes have proved the influence of these genes on cancer behavior and may serve as a basis for clinical gene therapy. IFN-alpha and IFN-beta genes are located at 9p21-22, the site of frequent homozygotic deletions in cancer. Their loss sensitizes cells to the growth inhibitory actions of exogenous IFNs. The IFN-gamma gene, a representative of class II genes, is located at 12q24.1. Transfection of class II IFNs genes to cancer cell lines causes cell proliferation arrest and augments the expression of HLA antigens, which may be clinically useful in stimulating the immune destruction of tumor cells. The interferon regulatory factor 1 (IRF-1) gene is located at 5q31, the site of common deletions in myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) and secondary leukemias. The loss of heterozygosity of this gene was found in MDS, which proves that IRF-1 may be a tumor suppressor. A transfection of its gene causes neoplastic transformation arrest. The double-stranded RNA-activated protein kinase (PKR) gene is located at 2p21-22, a region which is frequently rearranged in leukemia. Transfection of a wild type PKR gene reverses neoplastic transformation caused by transfection of a mutated PKR gene, proving that PKR acts as a dominant negative cancer suppressor.","['Haus, O']",['Haus O'],"['Department of Clinical Genetics, University Medical School, Bydgoszcz, Poland. haus@aci.amb.bydgoszcz.pl']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Switzerland,Arch Immunol Ther Exp (Warsz),Archivum immunologiae et therapiae experimentalis,0114365,IM,"['Animals', '*Chromosome Aberrations', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics', 'Gene Rearrangement', 'Humans', 'Interferon Regulatory Factor-1', 'Interferons/*genetics', 'Neoplasms/enzymology/*genetics/*immunology', 'Phosphoproteins/genetics', 'Receptors, Interferon/genetics', 'Transfection', 'eIF-2 Kinase/genetics']",2000/05/12 09:00,2000/07/25 11:00,['2000/05/12 09:00'],"['2000/05/12 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/07/25 11:00 [medline]', '2000/05/12 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Arch Immunol Ther Exp (Warsz). 2000;48(2):95-100.,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (IRF1 protein, human)', '0 (Interferon Regulatory Factor-1)', '0 (Phosphoproteins)', '0 (Receptors, Interferon)', '07MXG07O12 (interferon gamma receptor)', '9008-11-1 (Interferons)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (eIF-2 Kinase)']",43,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These compounds form very stable duplexes with complementary native phosphodiester DNA and exceptionally stable duplexes with RNA strands. Increases in duplex melting temperature, deltaTm, relatively to their phosphodiester counterparts, reaches 2.9-3.5 degrees C per modified nucleoside. Moreover, the phosphoramidate compounds form extremely stable triple stranded complexes with single or double stranded DNA oligomers under near physiological salt and pH conditions. Melting temperatures of these triplexes usually exceed that of the isosequential phosphodiester counterparts by up to 35 degrees C. For 11-15-mers 2'-deoxyphosphoramidates are structurally and functionally similar to the native RNA molecules and thus can be used as RNA decoys. They are resistant to enzymatic digestion by nucleases both in vitro and in vivo. Oligonucleotide phosphoramidates apparently are cell permeable, and they have a good bioavailability and biodistribution, while being non-toxic in mice at therapeutically relevant doses. Duplexes of the several studied phosphoramidates with complementary RNA strands apparently are not substrates for RNase H in vitro. Despite that, these compounds exerted high sequence-specific antisense activity in various cell lines and in SCID mice. The observed in vitro lack of RNase H recognition of the RNA:phosphoramidate duplexes may result in better specificity in biological activity of these compounds relative to RNase H inducing oligonucleotides. Experimental results also indicate that oligonucleotide phosphoramidates can be used as efficient and specific modulators of gene expression by an antigene mechanism of action. Finally, the oligo-2'-deoxyphosphoramidate double stranded complexes can structurally mimic native RNA complexes, which could be efficiently and specifically recognized by the RNA binding proteins, such as HIV-1 Rev and Tat.","['Gryaznov, S M']",['Gryaznov SM'],"['Geron Corporation, Menlo Park, CA 94025, USA. sgryaznov@geron.com']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Netherlands,Biochim Biophys Acta,Biochimica et biophysica acta,0217513,IM,"['Amides/*chemistry', 'Animals', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'DNA/chemistry', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', '*Drug Design', 'Gene Expression/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Experimental/drug therapy/pathology', 'Mice', 'Molecular Mimicry/genetics', 'Nucleic Acid Conformation', 'Oligonucleotides, Antisense/*chemistry/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics', 'Phosphoric Acids/*chemistry', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Substrate Specificity/genetics', 'Survival Rate']",2000/05/12 09:00,2000/06/08 09:00,['2000/05/12 09:00'],"['2000/05/12 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/06/08 09:00 [medline]', '2000/05/12 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0167-4781(99)00151-7 [pii]', '10.1016/s0167-4781(99)00151-7 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochim Biophys Acta. 1999 Dec 10;1489(1):131-40. doi: 10.1016/s0167-4781(99)00151-7.,"['0 (Amides)', '0 (Oligonucleotides, Antisense)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Phosphoric Acids)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', '9Q189608GB (phosphoramidic acid)']",28,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the groups of superficial gastritis and normal controls, no mutation were detected in codon 12 of ras. Mutations of H-ras 61 codon and N-ras 12 codon in various groups were the same as those in normal control. K-ras 12 codon mutation was detected in only 2 cases of gastric cancer by using PCR-SSCP, but it was not detected by DNA sequencing, which may be polymorphism.

The PCR analysis and G418 selection of the spleen colonies and bone marrow cells isolated from lethally irradiated animals 15 days and 30 days after injection of genetically modified bone marrow cells showed that the progeny cells of the transduced hematopoietic stem cells still contained and expressed the transduced genes, suggesting that the hematopoietic system is at least partially re-constructed by the stem cells with marker gene and that the stable expression of foreign genes in vivo can be attained by using this easy and harmless transduction protocol.

High expression of bcl-2 protein was associated with a bad clinical prognosis and a poor response after intensive chemotherapy. Bax seemed to coexpress with bcl-2 and so appeared to be a bad prognostic factor instead of a good one. The expression of Fas/Apo-1 was inversely correlated with bcl-2 and seemed to be a good prognostic factor which may reflect the relative homeostasis of apoptotic pathway.

It is widely expressed in fetal tissues, abundantly expressed in adult thymus, bone marrow and testis, and is expressed at low levels in heart, placenta and spleen. The RAB6KIFL gene is mapped to human chromosome 5, band q31, spans approximately 8.5kb of genomic DNA, and contains 19 exons. RAB6KIFL maps within the smallest commonly deleted segment in myeloid leukemias characterized by a deletion of 5q; however, we detected no mutations of RAB6KIFL in malignant myeloid disorders with loss of 5q. The description of this human kinesin-like protein may provide a better understanding of the diversity of this large family of proteins.","['Lai, F', 'Fernald, A A', 'Zhao, N', 'Le Beau, M M']","['Lai F', 'Fernald AA', 'Zhao N', 'Le Beau MM']","['Section of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Medicine, and The Cancer Research Center, University of Chicago, Chicago, IL 60637, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Netherlands,Gene,Gene,7706761,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Base Sequence', 'Chromosome Mapping', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 5/genetics', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'DNA, Complementary/chemistry/*genetics', 'DNA, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Exons', 'Female', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Introns', 'K562 Cells', 'Kinesins/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/genetics', 'Male', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/genetics', 'Polymorphism, Single-Stranded Conformational', 'RNA/genetics/metabolism', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid', 'Sequence Homology, Nucleic Acid', 'Tissue Distribution', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2000/05/12 09:00,2000/07/08 11:00,['2000/05/12 09:00'],"['2000/05/12 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/07/08 11:00 [medline]', '2000/05/12 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0378-1119(00)00135-9 [pii]', '10.1016/s0378-1119(00)00135-9 [doi]']",ppublish,Gene. 2000 May 2;248(1-2):117-25. doi: 10.1016/s0378-1119(00)00135-9.,"['0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (KIF20A protein, human)', '63231-63-0 (RNA)', 'EC 3.6.4.4 (Kinesins)']",,,,['P01CA40046/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,"['GENBANK/AA157866', 'GENBANK/AA179845', 'GENBANK/AA219691']",,,,,,,,,,

This study investigated the DNA damage induced by doxorubicin (DOX) delivered to human leukemia (HL-60) cells from pluronic P-105 micelles with and without the application of ultrasound. The comet assay was used to quantify the amount of DNA damage. No significant DNA damage was observed when the cells were treated with 0.1, 1 and 10 wt% P-105 with or without ultrasound (70 kHz, 1.3 W/cm(2)) for 1 h or for up to 3 h in 10 wt% P-105. However, when cells were incubated with 10 microg/ml free DOX for up to 9 h, DNA damage increased with incubation time (P=0.0011). Exposure of cells to the same concentration of DOX in the presence of 10-wt% P-105 showed no significant DNA damage for up to 9 h of incubation. However, when ultrasound was applied, a rapid and significant increase in DNA damage was observed (P=0.0001). The application of ultrasound causes the release of DOX from micelles or causes the HL-60 cells to take up the micelle encapsulated DOX. Our experiments indicated that the combination of DOX, ultrasound and pluronic P105 causes the largest DNA damage to HL-60 cells. We believe that this technique can be used for controlled drug delivery.","['Husseini, G A', 'El-Fayoumi, R I', ""O'Neill, K L"", 'Rapoport, N Y', 'Pitt, W G']","['Husseini GA', 'El-Fayoumi RI', ""O'Neill KL"", 'Rapoport NY', 'Pitt WG']","['Department of Chemical Engineering, Brigham Young University, Provo, UT 84602, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Ireland,Cancer Lett,Cancer letters,7600053,IM,"['*Comet Assay', '*DNA Damage', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Doxorubicin/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Drug Delivery Systems', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Micelles', 'Time Factors', '*Ultrasonography']",2000/05/12 09:00,2000/07/08 11:00,['2000/05/12 09:00'],"['2000/05/12 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/07/08 11:00 [medline]', '2000/05/12 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0304383500003992 [pii]', '10.1016/s0304-3835(00)00399-2 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Lett. 2000 Jun 30;154(2):211-6. doi: 10.1016/s0304-3835(00)00399-2.,"['0 (Micelles)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)']",,,,"['CA 76562/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL 59923/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We describe here developments in the visualization of ND10 and the mechanism of ND10 assembly made possible by the identification of proteins that are essential for this process using cell lines that lack individual ND10-associated proteins. PML is critical for the proper localization of all other ND10-associated proteins under physiological conditions. Introducing PML into a PML -/- cell line by transient expression or fusion with PML-producing cells recruited ND10-associated proteins into de novo formed ND10, attesting to its essential nature in ND10 formation. This recruitment includes Daxx, a protein that can bind PML and is highly enriched in condensed chromatin in the absence of PML. The segregation of Daxx from condensed chromatin to ND10 by increased accumulation of Sentrin/SUMO-1 modified PML suggests the presence of a variable equilibrium between these two nuclear sites. These findings identify the basic requirements for ND10 formation and suggest a dynamic mechanism for protein recruitment to these nuclear domains controlled by the SUMO-1 modification state of PML. Additional adapter proteins are suggested to exist by the behavior of Sp100, and Sp100 will provide the basis for their identification. Further information about the dynamic balance of proteins between ND10 and the actual site of functional activity of these proteins will establish whether ND10 function as homeostatic regulators or only in storage of excess proteins destined for turnover.","['Maul, G G', 'Negorev, D', 'Bell, P', 'Ishov, A M']","['Maul GG', 'Negorev D', 'Bell P', 'Ishov AM']","['The Wistar Institute, 3601 Spruce Street, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, 19104, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,J Struct Biol,Journal of structural biology,9011206,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Nucleus/*ultrastructure', 'DNA/analysis', 'Humans', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*analysis/genetics', 'Nuclear Proteins/*analysis', 'Organelles/*ultrastructure', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'Recombinant Proteins/analysis', 'Transcription Factors/*analysis/genetics', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins']",2000/05/12 09:00,2000/08/06 11:00,['2000/05/12 09:00'],"['2000/05/12 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/08/06 11:00 [medline]', '2000/05/12 09:00 [entrez]']","['10.1006/jsbi.2000.4239 [doi]', 'S1047-8477(00)94239-4 [pii]']",ppublish,J Struct Biol. 2000 Apr;129(2-3):278-87. doi: 10.1006/jsbi.2000.4239.,"['0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",55,,['Copyright 2000 Academic Press.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The resulting enzyme is able to cleave several target proteins after the second aspartate of a DEVD sequence common to all the substrates of caspases 3 and 7 (DEVDase). Because active caspase 3 is a common effector in several apoptotic pathways, it may be a good marker to detect (pre-)apoptotic cells by flow cytometry (FCM). Materials and Methods Apoptosis was induced in U937 or bone marrow mononuclear cells by daunorubicin (DNR), idarubicin (IDA), or camptothecin (CAM). Viable and apoptotic cells were sorted by FCM on the basis of either fluorescein isothiocyante (FITC)-annexin V binding or DiOC6(3) accumulation. DEVDase activity was measured in sorted populations by spectrofluorometry. Cleaved caspase 3 was labeled in situ with phycoerythrin (PE)-conjugated anti-activated caspase 3 antibodies and analyzed by FCM. RESULTS: DEVDase activity was detected in sorted viable CAM- and DNR-treated U937 cells, demonstrating that a partial caspase activation occurred earlier than phosphatidyl-serine exposure and mitochondrial membrane potential dissipation. The presence of a low amount of active caspase 3 in the treated viable cells was confirmed in situ with PE-conjugated anti-active caspase 3 antibodies. The same antibody was used in combination with FITC-annexin V and CD45-PC5 to study caspase 3 activation in acute leukemia blast cells after in vitro DNR and IDA treatment. Both anthracyclines induced a caspase 3-dependent apoptosis that was more efficient in blast cells than in contaminating lymphocytes. CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrate that anti-active caspase 3 labeling can be an alternative to fluorogenic substrates to efficiently detect early apoptosis by FCM in heterogeneous samples. They also confirm that anthracyclines induce blast cell apoptosis by a caspase 3-dependent pathway.","['Belloc, F', 'Belaud-Rotureau, M A', 'Lavignolle, V', 'Bascans, E', 'Braz-Pereira, E', 'Durrieu, F', 'Lacombe, F']","['Belloc F', 'Belaud-Rotureau MA', 'Lavignolle V', 'Bascans E', 'Braz-Pereira E', 'Durrieu F', 'Lacombe F']","[""Laboratoire d'Hematologie, Hopital Haut Leveque, Pessac, France. francis.belloc@wanadoo.fr""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cytometry,Cytometry,8102328,IM,"['Adult', 'Annexin A5/metabolism', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/pharmacology', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Apoptosis/drug effects/*physiology', 'Biomarkers', 'Blotting, Western', 'Bone Marrow Cells/*cytology/enzymology', 'Camptothecin/pharmacology', 'Caspase 3', 'Caspase 7', 'Caspases/analysis/immunology/*metabolism', 'Daunorubicin/pharmacology', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects/physiology', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Flow Cytometry/*methods', 'Fluorescein-5-isothiocyanate', 'Fluorescent Dyes', 'Humans', 'Idarubicin/pharmacology', 'Leukemia/diagnosis/*enzymology', 'Peptide Hydrolases/metabolism', 'Protein Binding/physiology', 'U937 Cells']",2000/05/11 09:00,2000/07/06 11:00,['2000/05/11 09:00'],"['2000/05/11 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/07/06 11:00 [medline]', '2000/05/11 09:00 [entrez]']","['10.1002/(SICI)1097-0320(20000601)40:2<151::AID-CYTO9>3.0.CO;2-9 [pii]', '10.1002/(sici)1097-0320(20000601)40:2<151::aid-cyto9>3.0.co;2-9 [doi]']",ppublish,Cytometry. 2000 Jun 1;40(2):151-60. doi: 10.1002/(sici)1097-0320(20000601)40:2<151::aid-cyto9>3.0.co;2-9.,"['0 (Annexin A5)', '0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Fluorescent Dyes)', 'EC 3.4.- (Peptide Hydrolases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP7 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 7)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'EC 3.4.99.- (DEVDase)', 'I223NX31W9 (Fluorescein-5-isothiocyanate)', 'XT3Z54Z28A (Camptothecin)', 'ZRP63D75JW (Idarubicin)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",,,"['Copyright 2000 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, it has been difficult to visualize and identify dynamic intercellular adhesions between migrating cells in situ. METHODS: Two fluorescent membrane dyes, PKH2 and PKH26 for staining HT1080 and hematopoietic cells and cell lines, and an automated fluorescence microscopy system were used to monitor intercellular adhesion. RESULTS: Cellular extensions connecting two or more adjacent cells were visualized, showing the intercellular adhesion between migrating cells for minutes and up to hours. After cells adhered to each other, followed by cell migration in different directions, cellular extensions were dragged from the pivotal contact points in different focal planes. CD34(+)-enriched mobilized peripheral blood cells and six hematopoietic cell lines showed intercellular connections in cocultures with HT1080. However, the frequency of intercellular connections was variable in different cocultures. A cell density of about 3.1 x 10(4) cells/cm(2) for both cell lines in cocultures provided an adequate number of cells in each field of view, showing up to four intercellular connections per 100 total cells plated. DISCUSSION: The tools derived from this study will open new areas of investigation for understanding the mechanism of the intercellular adhesion process.","['Oh, D J', 'Martinez, A R', 'Lee, G M', 'Francis, K', 'Palsson, B O']","['Oh DJ', 'Martinez AR', 'Lee GM', 'Francis K', 'Palsson BO']","['Department of Bioengineering, University of California at San Diego, 92093-0412, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cytometry,Cytometry,8102328,IM,"['Antigens, CD34/*analysis', 'Burkitt Lymphoma', 'Cell Adhesion/physiology', 'Cell Count', 'Cell Culture Techniques/methods', '*Fibrosarcoma', 'Fluorescent Dyes', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*chemistry/*cytology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, B-Cell', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute', 'Leukemia, T-Cell', 'Microscopy, Fluorescence/instrumentation/methods', '*Organic Chemicals', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/chemistry/cytology']",2000/05/11 09:00,2000/07/06 11:00,['2000/05/11 09:00'],"['2000/05/11 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/07/06 11:00 [medline]', '2000/05/11 09:00 [entrez]']","['10.1002/(SICI)1097-0320(20000601)40:2<119::AID-CYTO5>3.0.CO;2-P [pii]', '10.1002/(sici)1097-0320(20000601)40:2<119::aid-cyto5>3.0.co;2-p [doi]']",ppublish,Cytometry. 2000 Jun 1;40(2):119-25. doi: 10.1002/(sici)1097-0320(20000601)40:2<119::aid-cyto5>3.0.co;2-p.,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Fluorescent Dyes)', '0 (Organic Chemicals)', '0 (PKH 26)', '0 (PKH2-GL)']",,,"['Copyright 2000 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']","['R01 HL59234/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL60398/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, hyperosmotic stress was considered as an elicitor. METHODS: Using two fluorescent membrane dyes PKH2 and PKH26, and an automated fluorescence microscopy system, morphological changes of seven human cell lines (six hematopoietic, one fibrosarcoma) at different osmolalities were monitored. Presence of surface molecules on the hyperosmolality-induced podia (osmopodia) was examined. RESULTS: In hyperosmotic medium, cells shrank rapidly, followed by osmopodia extension. Cells exhibited variable number (up to five) and length (up to longer than 100 microm) of osmopodia in about 1 h. Dead cells did not extend podia. Frequency, length, and number of podia were variable among cell lines studied. CD44 and CD45 were not present on the osmopodia, although they were present on the cell surface, showing that osmopodia characteristics differ from the podia observed previously in isotonic media. The osmopodia extension process was shown to be reversible upon repeated osmolality changes. CONCLUSIONS: Osmopodia extended by human hematopoietic cell lines display a newly observed cellular morphology and provide a tool for investigation of dynamic cellular response to environmental changes.","['Oh, D J', 'Martinez, A R', 'Lee, G M', 'Francis, K', 'Palsson, B O']","['Oh DJ', 'Martinez AR', 'Lee GM', 'Francis K', 'Palsson BO']","['Department of Bioengineering, University of California at San Diego, 92093-0412, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cytometry,Cytometry,8102328,IM,"['Antigens, CD/analysis', 'Antigens, Surface/analysis', 'Burkitt Lymphoma', 'Cell Size/drug effects/physiology', 'Cell Survival/drug effects/physiology', 'Fibrosarcoma', 'Fluorescent Dyes', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/chemistry/*ultrastructure', 'Humans', 'Hypertonic Solutions/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, B-Cell', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute', 'Leukemia, T-Cell', 'Microscopy, Fluorescence', 'Organic Chemicals', 'Osmolar Concentration', 'Pseudopodia/*physiology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Water-Electrolyte Balance/*physiology']",2000/05/11 09:00,2000/07/06 11:00,['2000/05/11 09:00'],"['2000/05/11 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/07/06 11:00 [medline]', '2000/05/11 09:00 [entrez]']","['10.1002/(SICI)1097-0320(20000601)40:2<109::AID-CYTO4>3.0.CO;2-V [pii]', '10.1002/(sici)1097-0320(20000601)40:2<109::aid-cyto4>3.0.co;2-v [doi]']",ppublish,Cytometry. 2000 Jun 1;40(2):109-18. doi: 10.1002/(sici)1097-0320(20000601)40:2<109::aid-cyto4>3.0.co;2-v.,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Surface)', '0 (Fluorescent Dyes)', '0 (Hypertonic Solutions)', '0 (Organic Chemicals)', '0 (PKH2-GL)']",,,"['Copyright 2000 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']","['R01 HL59234/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL60398/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we show that these Notch1 mutations represent two clearly distinct classes. In the first class (type I), proviral integrations were clustered just upstream of sequences encoding the transmembrane domain. Type I Notch1 alleles produced two types of mutant Notch1 RNA, one of which encoded the entire Notch1 cytoplasmic domain [N(IC)] and the other of which encoded a soluble ectodomain [N(EC)(Mut)] which, in contrast to the processed wild-type ectodomain [N(EC)(WT)], did not reside at the cell surface and became secreted in a temperature-dependent manner. A second, novel class of mutant Notch1 allele (type II) encoded a Notch1 receptor with the C-terminal PEST motif deleted (DeltaCT). The type II Notch1(DeltaCT) protein was expressed as a normally processed receptor [N(EC)(WT) and N(IC)(DeltaCT)] at the cell surface, and its ectodomain was found to be shed into the extracellular medium in a temperature- and calcium-dependent manner. These data suggest that both type I and type II mutations generate two structurally distinct Notch1 N(EC) and N(IC) proteins that may participate in tumor formation, in collaboration with the c-myc oncogene, through distinct mechanisms. Constitutive type I N(IC) and type II N(IC)(DeltaCT) expression may enhance Notch1 intracellular signaling, while secreted or shed type I N(EC)(Mut) and type II N(EC) proteins may differentially interact in an autocrine or paracrine fashion with ligands of Notch1 and affect their signaling.","['Hoemann, C D', 'Beaulieu, N', 'Girard, L', 'Rebai, N', 'Jolicoeur, P']","['Hoemann CD', 'Beaulieu N', 'Girard L', 'Rebai N', 'Jolicoeur P']","['Laboratory of Molecular Biology, Clinical Research Institute of Montreal, Montreal, Quebec H2W 1R7, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,IM,"['*Alleles', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Cell Line, Transformed', 'Cell Membrane/metabolism', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/*etiology', 'Membrane Proteins/*genetics', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutagenesis, Insertional', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc/genetics/*physiology', 'Proviruses/genetics', 'RNA', 'RNA Processing, Post-Transcriptional', 'Receptor, Notch1', '*Receptors, Cell Surface', 'T-Lymphocytes', 'Thymoma/*etiology', 'Thymus Neoplasms/*etiology', '*Transcription Factors']",2000/05/11 09:00,2000/07/08 11:00,['2000/05/11 09:00'],"['2000/05/11 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/07/08 11:00 [medline]', '2000/05/11 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/MCB.20.11.3831-3842.2000 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 2000 Jun;20(11):3831-42. doi: 10.1128/MCB.20.11.3831-3842.2000.,"['0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Notch1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc)', '0 (Receptor, Notch1)', '0 (Receptors, Cell Surface)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '63231-63-0 (RNA)']",,PMC85710,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In order to evaluate corresponding carbohydrate-binding sites on human myelo- and erythropoietic cells which were able to react with mono- or oligosaccharides, we established an immunocytochemical double-staining assay. In a first step, cell lineages were visualized using Lewis(x) (CD15) or glycophorin C-specific monoclonal antibodies. The second step included polyacrylamide-conjugated carbohydrate structures. According to our results, the carbohydrate-binding potential of granulopoietic cells increased during the process of maturation, contrasting a reduction of carbohydrate-binding sites on erythroid precursor cells during differentiation. With respect to previous in vitro studies, these findings shed some light on certain aspects of bone marrow homing as well as on the trafficking of mature cellular elements into circulation. It is tempting to speculate that carbohydrate-mediated adhesion mechanisms may be involved in the various functional defects of progenitor cells in chronic myelogenic leukaemia, especially regarding their complex interactions with the marrow microenvironment.","['Baldus, S E', 'Wickenhauser, C', 'Dittmar, E', 'Stefanovic, A', 'Thiele, J']","['Baldus SE', 'Wickenhauser C', 'Dittmar E', 'Stefanovic A', 'Thiele J']","['Institute of Pathology, University of Cologne, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Histochem J,The Histochemical journal,0163161,IM,"['Binding Sites', 'Bone Marrow Cells/*metabolism', 'Erythrocytes/*metabolism', 'Glycoconjugates/*metabolism', 'Glycophorins/metabolism', 'Humans', '*Immunoenzyme Techniques', 'Leukocytes/*metabolism', 'Lewis X Antigen/metabolism', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/metabolism']",2000/05/11 09:00,2000/07/08 11:00,['2000/05/11 09:00'],"['2000/05/11 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/07/08 11:00 [medline]', '2000/05/11 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1023/a:1003954111600 [doi]'],ppublish,Histochem J. 2000 Jan;32(1):27-32. doi: 10.1023/a:1003954111600.,"['0 (Glycoconjugates)', '0 (Glycophorins)', '0 (Lewis X Antigen)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

They had been exposed within 500 meters from the hypocenter in heavily shielded conditions and were found from NHK-RIRBM joint study carried out from 1966 to 1971. Estimation of the exposure doses for these survivors was made under the following steps; 1) calculation by DS86 system (physically estimated doses) in survivors who had been exposed within 1,500 meters and had precise records of exposure conditions. RBE for the neutron was defined as 10. 2) setting of exposure dose-chromosome aberration curve, and 3) observation of chromosome aberrations in the proximally exposed survivors, for whom biological doses were estimated. Estimation of the exposure doses were possible from the aberration rate of chromosome in the peripheral lymphocytes, even 25-40 years after the exposure. Of the 78 survivors, 96% were estimated to have exposed more than one Sv. Detection of transforming gene(s) of N and K RAS genes in DNAs from non-leukemic survivors was carried out as one of the biological investigations for these heavily exposed survivors. All four survivors examined showed N or K RAS gene mutation. Three of the four healthy survivors had cancer or leukemia 7-10 years after the examination.

A subsequent study using synchronized cells revealed that the cells at the G2/M stage were uniquely sensitive to mutation induction by 252Cf radiation but not to gamma-rays (Tauchi et al., 1993). A long phase cell population was first subjected to conditioning gamma or 252Cf radiation doses at different dose-rates. The cell cycle distribution of these cells was then observed, and they were then exposed to 252Cf radiation, and the mutation rate was determined. The G2/M fraction increased by 3- to 4-fold when the conditioning doses (2 Gy of gamma or 1 Gy of 252Cf radiation) were delivered chronically over 10 h, but only slightly when the same doses were delivered over a 1 h period or less. Subsequent 252Cf irradiation gave higher mutation frequencies in the cells pre-irradiated with gamma-rays over a protracted period of time than in those exposed with the higher dose-rate gamma-rays. These results suggest that the radiation-induced G2 block could be at least partly (but not totally) responsible for this reverse dose-rate effect (Tauchi et al. 1996). Possible factors which cause the hyper-sensitivity of G2/M cells to mutation induction by neutrons will be discussed.","['Tauchi, H', 'Endo, S', 'Eguchi-Kasai, K', 'Furusawa, Y', 'Suzuki, M', 'Matsuura, S', 'Ando, K', 'Nakamura, N', 'Sawada, S', 'Komatsu, K']","['Tauchi H', 'Endo S', 'Eguchi-Kasai K', 'Furusawa Y', 'Suzuki M', 'Matsuura S', 'Ando K', 'Nakamura N', 'Sawada S', 'Komatsu K']","['Department of Radiation Biology, Hiroshima University, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,J Radiat Res,Journal of radiation research,0376611,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Cycle/genetics/*radiation effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Radiation', 'Hypoxanthine Phosphoribosyltransferase/genetics', 'Leukemia L5178', 'Linear Energy Transfer', 'Mice', '*Mutation', 'Thioguanine/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2000/05/11 09:00,2000/06/24 11:00,['2000/05/11 09:00'],"['2000/05/11 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/06/24 11:00 [medline]', '2000/05/11 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1269/jrr.40.s45 [doi]'],ppublish,J Radiat Res. 1999 Dec;40 Suppl:45-52. doi: 10.1269/jrr.40.s45.,"['EC 2.4.2.8 (Hypoxanthine Phosphoribosyltransferase)', 'FTK8U1GZNX (Thioguanine)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The courses were repeated monthly until response or progression, in the case of response, the therapy was administered until relapse. Morphologic diagnoses were refractory anemia with excess blasts (RAEB) in nine, RAEB in transformation (RAEB-t) in nine, and chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMMoL) in four patients; in all cases, bone-marrow blast infiltration was greater than 10% (median 20%, range 12-30%). When the international prognostic scoring system was applied, all the cases qualified as intermediate/high-risk categories. Nineteen patients were males and three were females; the median age was 69 years (range 25-90 years); three patients had previously been treated with conventional chemotherapy, and one of them had also undergone autologous bone-marrow transplantation. The criteria of response were defined as follows: (1) complete response: normalization of blood counts and bone-marrow blasts (<5%), and (2) partial response: decrease in bone-marrow blast infiltration by 50%, and two of the following parameters - improvement in hemoglobin level by 1.5 g/dl or decrease by 50% in transfusional requirement, increase by 50% in absolute neutrophil count, and increase by 50% in platelet count. Overall, 7 (32%) of 22 patients achieved a response, with 5 (23%) being classified as complete responders and 2 (9%) as partial responders. Fifteen (68%) patients did not achieve any response, and 14 died of progressive disease or infectious disease. The overall median survival was 8 months (range 1-27 months), whereas the median survival of responders was 16 months (range 8-27 months); the median duration of response was 11 months (range 2-21 months). Moderate to severe hematological toxicity and infections were the most common side effects. In conclusion, it seems that the association of ATRA and LDARA-C may be effective in approximately 30% of HRMDS patients. Optimizing this approach might be pursued by selecting, on a biological basis, those cases more likely to respond or by incorporating other differentiating agents or growth factors.","['Venditti, A', 'Tamburini, A', 'Buccisano, F', 'Scimo, M T', 'Del Poeta, G', 'Maurillo, L', 'Cox, M C', 'Abruzzese, E', 'Tribalto, M', 'Masi, M', 'Amadori, S']","['Venditti A', 'Tamburini A', 'Buccisano F', 'Scimo MT', 'Del Poeta G', 'Maurillo L', 'Cox MC', 'Abruzzese E', 'Tribalto M', 'Masi M', 'Amadori S']","['Hematology, University o Tor Vergata, St. Eugenio Hospital, Rome, Italy. avenditti@pelagus.it']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Clinical Trial, Phase II', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Ann Hematol,Annals of hematology,9107334,IM,"['Administration, Oral', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Anemia/chemically induced', 'Cytarabine/*administration & dosage/adverse effects/toxicity', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Hypertriglyceridemia/chemically induced', 'Infections/chemically induced', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*drug therapy', 'Neutropenia/chemically induced', 'Thrombocytopenia/chemically induced', 'Tretinoin/*administration & dosage/adverse effects/toxicity']",2000/05/10 09:00,2000/06/08 09:00,['2000/05/10 09:00'],"['2000/05/10 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/06/08 09:00 [medline]', '2000/05/10 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s002770050569 [doi]'],ppublish,Ann Hematol. 2000 Mar;79(3):138-42. doi: 10.1007/s002770050569.,"['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Seventeen patients received one treatment regimen, 19 patients two treatment regimens, and 21 patients three or more treatment regimens. The treatment regimens analyzed were 6-thioguanine p.o. (daily) (T), 6-thioguanine p.o. (4-7 days/week) + cytarabine s.c./i.v. (once a week) (T+C), 6-mercaptopurine p.o. (daily) (MP), 6-mercaptopurine p.o. (daily) + methotrexate p.o./i.v.

The median leukocyte count was higher for M (73 x 10(9)/l) than for the other treatment regimens (T: 27 x 10(9)/l, T+ C: 37 x 10(9)/l, MP: 24 x 10(9)/l, MP + MTX: 30 x 10(9)/l, E: 31 x 10(9)/l). A cytoreduction >50% in the peripheral blood was achieved by T in 11/19, by T+C in 7/11, by MP in 5/8, by MP+MTX in 3/6, by E in 3/4, and by M in 16/22 patients. The period of cytoreduction was regarded as the duration of response - T: median 53 days, range 5-98; T+C: median 61 days, range 14-226; MP: median 37 days, range 4-192; MP + MTX: median 58 days, range 36-59; E: median 121 days, range 26-159; M: median 39 days, range 8-78. T and T + C were well tolerated by all but three patients (stomatitis, diarrhea, WHO grade 2). MP was accompanied by a rise of transaminases (WHO 1-3) in 5/6 patients. E led to stomatitis (WHO 1,2) in 4/5 and M to nausea/vomiting (WHO 1,2) in 5/22 and to stomatitis (WHO 2) in 4/22 cases. The mean survival time after start of palliative cytoreduction was 16 weeks (2-65). In summary, 6-thioguanine +/- cytarabine was best tolerated with effective but in oral monotherapy - often protracted cytoreduction in 60% of patients. Mitoxantrone showed tolerable side effects and potent cytoreduction in 73% of patients even after ineffective palliative pretreatment. Palliative cytoreductive therapy does not reduce the quality of life and can prevent complications of significant leukocytosis in refractory acute leukemia.","['Funke, I', 'Wiesneth, M', 'Platow, S', 'Kubanek, B']","['Funke I', 'Wiesneth M', 'Platow S', 'Kubanek B']","['Department of Transfusion Medicine and Red Cross Blood Center, University of Ulm, Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Germany,Ann Hematol,Annals of hematology,9107334,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Administration, Oral', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage/toxicity', 'Diarrhea/chemically induced', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Injections, Intravenous', 'Injections, Subcutaneous', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy', 'Leukocyte Count/drug effects', 'Male', 'Mercaptopurine/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Methotrexate/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Middle Aged', 'Nausea/chemically induced', '*Palliative Care', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Stomatitis/chemically induced', 'Thioguanine/administration & dosage/toxicity']",2000/05/10 09:00,2000/06/08 09:00,['2000/05/10 09:00'],"['2000/05/10 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/06/08 09:00 [medline]', '2000/05/10 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s002770050568 [doi]'],ppublish,Ann Hematol. 2000 Mar;79(3):132-7. doi: 10.1007/s002770050568.,"['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', 'E7WED276I5 (Mercaptopurine)', 'FTK8U1GZNX (Thioguanine)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A distinct subset of patients with B-CLL responds to treatment with IFNalpha, while the drug has no therapeutic effect in the majority of patients. The mechanism of this phenomenon is poorly understood. The cellular events induced by this cytokine mediated by a number of specific signaling events. Therefore, we studied the effect of recombinant IFNalpha on tyrosine phosphorylation and proliferation of cytosolic proteins in human cell lines and in freshly isolated B-CLL cells in order to test the potential value of these events as a pretreatment test for IFNalpha in CLL. In human lymphoid cell lines, IFNalpha induced tyrosine phosphorylation of multiple cytosolic proteins in a time- and concentration-dependent manner. This effect correlated with its growth-inhibitory effect in almost all cell lines. In marked contrast, in freshly isolated B-CLL cells IFNalpha seemed to have both stimulatory and inhibitory effects on proliferation, but it consistently stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation. Moreover, the clinical response of B-CLL to IFNalpha did not correlate with the activation of tyrosine kinases nor with the inhibition of cell growth in vitro. Therefore, the assessment of IFNalpha-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of cytosolic phospho-proteins does not allow to predict the treatment response to IFNalpha in CLL patients.","['von Bubnoff, N', 'Adler, S', 'Danhauser-Riedl, S', 'Kamp, T', 'Nerl, C', 'Emmerich, B', 'Hallek, M']","['von Bubnoff N', 'Adler S', 'Danhauser-Riedl S', 'Kamp T', 'Nerl C', 'Emmerich B', 'Hallek M']","['Medizinische Klinik, Klinikum Innenstadt, Ludwig-Maximilians-Unversitat, Munich, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Ann Hematol,Annals of hematology,9107334,IM,"['Aged', 'B-Lymphocytes/*cytology', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Cytosol/chemistry', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Extracellular Space/*enzymology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Interferon-alpha/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*metabolism', 'Proteins/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2000/05/10 09:00,2000/06/08 09:00,['2000/05/10 09:00'],"['2000/05/10 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/06/08 09:00 [medline]', '2000/05/10 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s002770050566 [doi]'],ppublish,Ann Hematol. 2000 Mar;79(3):119-26. doi: 10.1007/s002770050566.,"['0 (Interferon-alpha)', '0 (Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The therapeutic efficacy of IFN in polycythemia vera (PV) is demonstrated by the summarized treatment results of 279 patients participating in 16 prospective nonrandomized studies and in three case reports. The initial IFN dose ranged from 3 to 35 million IU/week. In 82% of the patients the frequency of phlebotomies was reduced. In 50% a complete remission was achieved, defined as a stable hematocrit of 45% without concomitant phlebotomies. Reduction of splenomegaly was seen in 77% and control of pruritus in 81% of the patients. The median observation time of the studies was 13 months (ranging from 3 to 84 months). Individual cases were followed for up to 126 months. In 21% of the patients IFN was terminated, owing mostly to side effects. The selective suppression of the malignant clone by IFN was demonstrated by the induction of cytogenetic remissions in sporadic cases with a chromosomal marker and by the observation of unmaintained remissions that lasted up to 4.8 years. IFN has no known mutagenic or teratogenic effects. The data presently available demonstrate that IFN is an effective alternative to the present forms of treatment in PV. Controlled prospective studies are essential to clarify whether the favorable biologic properties are also reflected by a benefit in clinical course and survival, and whether IFN may reduce the rates of acute leukemia and myelofibrosis.

A COMPARE analysis using the NCI 60 cell line drug-screening panel suggested that there were similarities in the mechanisms of action of camptothecin analogs and TS inhibitors. METHODS: TS enzymatic activity was measured by both an in situ tritium release assay using both the H630 colon cancer cell line and the CEM human leukemia cell line, and by a radiolabelled in vitro assay using partially purified human TS as the enzyme source. Thymidine kinase (TK) activity was measure by a radiolabelled in vitro assay using H630 colon cancer cell lysates as the enzyme source. RESULTS: In vitro studies indicated that none of the analogs directly inhibited TS enzymatic activity; however, utilization of a coupled TS/TK in situ assay with radiolabelled deoxyuridine as the precursor revealed marked inhibition by the camptothecin analogs. 9-AC, SN38, and topotecan yielded IC50 values of 1.3, 1.6, and 1.1 microM respectively. In contrast, there was no inhibition detected when deoxycytidine was used as the radiolabelled nucleoside precursor, suggesting that the drug effect was through inhibition of TK, rather than inhibition of TS. In vitro studies using cell lysates from H630 human colon cancer cells to measure TK activity showed no decrease in TK activity after 9-AC treatment. In addition, no changes were detected in the dATP and dTTP nucleotide pools. Permeabilizing the cell membranes with saponin did not abolish the inhibitory effect of the camptothecins indicating that altered cell transport was not responsible for the decreased activity in the in situ assay in intact cells. CONCLUSION: These studies suggest that there is inhibition of TK in intact cells associated with topoisomerase I inhibition by camptothecin analogs, and the inhibition of TK is the result of an indirect effect not related to feedback inhibition by changes in dTTP pools.","['Voeller, D M', 'Grem, J L', 'Pommier, Y', 'Paull, K', 'Allegra, C J']","['Voeller DM', 'Grem JL', 'Pommier Y', 'Paull K', 'Allegra CJ']","['Medicine Branch, NCI, Bethesda Naval Hospital, MD 20089, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Germany,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol,Cancer chemotherapy and pharmacology,7806519,IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/*pharmacology', 'Camptothecin/analogs & derivatives/*pharmacology', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Irinotecan', 'Phosphorylation', 'Thymidine Kinase/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Thymidylate Synthase/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Time Factors', 'Topotecan/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Zidovudine/metabolism']",2000/05/10 09:00,2000/06/08 09:00,['2000/05/10 09:00'],"['2000/05/10 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/06/08 09:00 [medline]', '2000/05/10 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s002800051010 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol. 2000;45(5):409-16. doi: 10.1007/s002800051010.,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '4B9XT59T7S (Zidovudine)', '5MB77ICE2Q (9-aminocamptothecin)', '7673326042 (Irinotecan)', '7M7YKX2N15 (Topotecan)', 'EC 2.1.1.45 (Thymidylate Synthase)', 'EC 2.7.1.21 (Thymidine Kinase)', 'XT3Z54Z28A (Camptothecin)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Data from the hospital-based, melanoma registry of a specialist unit (the Melanoma Unit at Charing Cross Hospital, London, UK) were compared with the incidence rates in a population-based cancer registry (the Thames Cancer Registry). In total, 2076 patients with the histological diagnosis of melanoma established between 1960 and 1997 who were registered with the Melanoma Unit at Charing Cross Hospital, were included in the study. Patterns in time and in the tumour type of the additional cancers were analysed in the cohort. The relative risk of subsequent cancers was evaluated, the number of expected cancers being calculated by applying incidence rates in the population of south-east England to the person-years of follow-up in the cohort. Sixty-six (3%) of the 2076 evaluable patients had a history of, or developed, 69 histologically verified additional cancers, the commonest being colorectal, breast and lymphoma. Twenty-six additional cancers preceded the diagnosis of melanoma by 1-42 years, 16 were diagnosed within 12 months and 27 followed the diagnosis of melanoma, 1-28 years later. Seven cancers occurred after chemotherapy for metastatic melanoma: two colorectal, one bladder, one renal, two myelodysplasias and one acute myeloid leukaemia. The relative risk of additional cancers developing after the diagnosis of melanoma during the 8537 evaluable years-at-risk was 0.64 (95% confidence interval 0.41-0.96; P = 0.0006). Thus, the risk of additional cancers following treatment for metastatic melanoma in this cohort is small. The potential influence of other factors on the occurrence of additional cancers observed overall in this study requires further investigation.","['Retsas, S', 'Mohith, A', 'Bell, J', 'Horwood, N', 'Alexander, H']","['Retsas S', 'Mohith A', 'Bell J', 'Horwood N', 'Alexander H']","['Melanoma Unit, Directorate of Cancer Services and Haematology, Hammersmith Hospitals NHS Trust, Charing Cross Hospital, London, UK. s.retsas@ic.ac.uk']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Melanoma Res,Melanoma research,9109623,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Agents/adverse effects', 'Breast Neoplasms/epidemiology', 'Cohort Studies', 'Colorectal Neoplasms/epidemiology', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Life Tables', 'London/epidemiology', 'Lymphoma/epidemiology', 'Male', 'Melanoma/*epidemiology', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/chemically induced/*epidemiology', 'Registries', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk', 'Survival Analysis', 'Time Factors']",2000/05/10 09:00,2000/08/12 11:00,['2000/05/10 09:00'],"['2000/05/10 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/08/12 11:00 [medline]', '2000/05/10 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Melanoma Res. 2000 Apr;10(2):145-52.,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The patient had hypercalcemia and multiple lymphadenopathy. Histopathologic study of left cervical lymph node (LN) and bone marrow (BM) revealed that infiltrates of malignant lymphoid cells were composed of small, medium and large cells with pleomorphic nuclei. Smears of peripheral blood (PB) showed lymphopenia (16%) with the appearance of a few atypical lymphoid cells (less than 2%), but not the typical clover leaf cells seen in ATLL. Immunophenotypic study of LN and BM revealed T cell phenotype. PB showed increased CD4+ T cell (T(H), CD3/CD4+, 57%) and decreased CD8+ T cell counts (T(S), CD3/CD8+, 6.7%). The sera of the patient and her family were reactive for HTLV-I antibody. The specific sequences of pol, env, and tax of HTLV-I DNA were detected in the lymphoma cells and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) using polymerase chain reaction. Ultrastructural examination of PBMC confirmed numerous type c virus particles in extracellular space. This case was an acute type of ATLL without overt leukemic features in PB. Despite chemotherapy and intensive conservative treatment, she died 3 months after admission.","['Jeon, H J', 'Lee, M J', 'Jeong, Y K', 'Lee, D M', 'Oh, Y K', 'Kim, C W']","['Jeon HJ', 'Lee MJ', 'Jeong YK', 'Lee DM', 'Oh YK', 'Kim CW']","['Department of Pathology, Chosun University Medical School, Kwangju, Korea. hijon@mail.chosun.ac.kr']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Korea (South),J Korean Med Sci,Journal of Korean medical science,8703518,IM,"['Biopsy', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'DNA, Viral/analysis', 'Deltaretrovirus Infections/pathology', 'Fatal Outcome', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Gene Products, env/genetics', 'Gene Products, pol/genetics', 'Gene Products, tax/genetics', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1', 'Humans', 'Hypercalcemia/pathology/virology', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Korea', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/immunology/*pathology/virology', 'Lymph Nodes/pathology', 'Lymphopenia/immunology/*pathology/virology', 'Microscopy, Electron', 'Middle Aged', 'T-Lymphocytes/pathology/ultrastructure/virology']",2000/05/10 09:00,2000/07/25 11:00,['2000/05/10 09:00'],"['2000/05/10 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/07/25 11:00 [medline]', '2000/05/10 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.3346/jkms.2000.15.2.233 [doi]'],ppublish,J Korean Med Sci. 2000 Apr;15(2):233-9. doi: 10.3346/jkms.2000.15.2.233.,"['0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (Gene Products, env)', '0 (Gene Products, pol)', '0 (Gene Products, tax)']",,PMC3054617,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We studied the actions of two other members of this family, IL-11 and ciliary neurotropic factor (CNTF), on folliculostellate (FS) cells (TtT/GF cell line) and lactosomatotropic cells (GH3 cell line). The messenger RNA (mRNA) for the alpha-chain specific for the IL-11 receptor (1.7 kb) and CNTF receptor (2 kb) are expressed on both cell types. In addition, we detected CNTF receptor mRNA in normal rat anterior pituitary cells. IL-11 (1.25-5 nM) dose dependently stimulated the proliferation of FS cells. CNTF, at doses from 0.4-2 nM, also significantly stimulated the growth of these cells. In addition, both cytokines significantly stimulated proliferation of lactosomatotropic GH3 cells, and CNTF stimulated hormone production (GH and PRL) at 24 h by these cells. At 16-72 h, IL-11 stimulates the secretion of the angiogenic factor vascular endothelial growth factor by FS cells. In addition, both GH3 and FS cells express CNTF mRNA. These data suggest that IL-11 and CNTF may act as growth and regulatory factors in anterior pituitary cells.","['Perez Castro, C', 'Nagashima, A C', 'Pereda, M P', 'Goldberg, V', 'Chervin, A', 'Largen, P', 'Renner, U', 'Stalla, G K', 'Arzt, E']","['Perez Castro C', 'Nagashima AC', 'Pereda MP', 'Goldberg V', 'Chervin A', 'Largen P', 'Renner U', 'Stalla GK', 'Arzt E']","['Department de Biologia, FCEN, Universidad de Buenos Aires, Argentina.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Endocrinology,Endocrinology,0375040,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Division', 'Cell Line', 'Ciliary Neurotrophic Factor/*physiology', 'Endothelial Growth Factors/metabolism', 'Female', 'Interleukin-11/*physiology', 'Interleukin-11 Receptor alpha Subunit', 'Lactation/*physiology', 'Lymphokines/metabolism', 'Male', 'Pituitary Gland, Anterior/cytology/*physiology', 'Rats', 'Rats, Sprague-Dawley', 'Receptor, Ciliary Neurotrophic Factor/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Receptors, Interleukin/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Receptors, Interleukin-11', 'Recombinant Proteins/pharmacology', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factors']",2000/05/10 09:00,2000/06/08 09:00,['2000/05/10 09:00'],"['2000/05/10 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/06/08 09:00 [medline]', '2000/05/10 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1210/endo.141.5.7442 [doi]'],ppublish,Endocrinology. 2000 May;141(5):1746-53. doi: 10.1210/endo.141.5.7442.,"['0 (Ciliary Neurotrophic Factor)', '0 (Endothelial Growth Factors)', '0 (Il11ra1 protein, rat)', '0 (Interleukin-11)', '0 (Interleukin-11 Receptor alpha Subunit)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Receptor, Ciliary Neurotrophic Factor)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-11)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A)', '0 (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factors)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Many tumors lacking MTAP have been found to homozygously delete the chromosome 9p region containing the p16 tumor suppressor gene. Several methods have been used to detect chromosome 9p deletions in primary tumors. However, the accurate diagnosis of chromosome 9p deletions has been hampered by the presence of contaminating normal cells. In search of an accurate and sensitive diagnostic method, we have developed the real-time polymerase chain reaction assay using the TaqMan chemistry for quantitative detection of MTAP and p16 gene deletions. The assay's feasibility was tested with peripheral blood leukocytes (PBL) from 29 patients with adult T cell leukemia (ATL) previously analyzed with Southern blot analysis and validated on 39 PBL or bone marrow samples from childhood T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL). Homozygous deletions of MTAP and p16 genes were detected respectively in six (20.7%) and eight (27.6%) of 29 ATL samples and in 15 (38.5%) and 23 (59%) of 39 T-ALL samples.

A new cell line (KHYG-1) was established by culturing peripheral leukemia cells with 100 units of recombinant interleukin (IL)-2.

Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) DNA was not detected in KHYG-1 cells by Southern blot analysis with a terminal repeat probe from an EBV genome. A point mutation in exon 7 of the p53 gene was detected in the KHYG-1 cells by PCR/SSCP analysis, and direct sequencing revealed the conversion of C to T at nucleotide 877 in codon 248.

The diversity of plasma cells was found to take two major forms when the fine structure of the T(12;15) translocation was used as the clonotypic marker. First, mosaics of clones containing translocations that were apparently unrelated to each other were detected in nine out of 17 (53%) mice. Second, subclones derived from common T(12;15)+ progenitors by either secondary deletions in translocation breakpoint regions or aberrant isotype switching near translocation breaksites were found in five of 17 (29.5%) mice. When Ig expression was utilized as the clonotypic marker, clonal mosaics were shown to occur in all mice. This was demonstrated by the finding that the prevalent IgA- or IgG-producing plasmacytoma clone was invariably accompanied by smaller clones of IgG- or IgA-expressing neoplastic plasma cells, respectively. These results provided new insights into the clonal diversification at the terminal stage of plasmacytomagenesis. In addition, they suggested that BALB/c plasmacytomas may be uniquely useful for studying clonal diversity during B cell oncogenesis, since clonal evolution can be evaluated in a pool of tumor and tumor precursor cells that is clearly defined by the T(12;15) chromosomal translocation and the production of monoclonal immunoglobulin.","['Kovalchuk, A L', 'Mushinski, E B', 'Janz, S']","['Kovalchuk AL', 'Mushinski EB', 'Janz S']","['Laboratory of Genetics, Division of Basic Sciences, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892-4255, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', '*Chromosome Mapping', 'Genes, Immunoglobulin', 'Genes, myc', 'Genetic Variation', 'Immunoglobulin A/genetics', 'Immunoglobulin G/genetics', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/genetics', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Plasma Cells/pathology', 'Plasmacytoma/*genetics/immunology/pathology', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', '*Translocation, Genetic']",2000/05/10 09:00,2000/06/08 09:00,['2000/05/10 09:00'],"['2000/05/10 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/06/08 09:00 [medline]', '2000/05/10 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2401676 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 2000 May;14(5):909-21. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2401676.,"['0 (Immunoglobulin A)', '0 (Immunoglobulin G)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The results were correlated with the data from our previous studies of CDKN2A deletion and hypermethylation, other p53 pathway components, p27Kip1 expression, and proliferation, as well as with clinical outcome, including prognosis. We found aberrant pRb expression in four (12%) of 34 DLCLs. One of these had a point mutation in intron 3 10 bp downstream of exon 3 generating a novel splice signal. Seven tumours (21%) showed cyclin D3 overexpression, including all three thyroid lymphomas (P = 0.006). Cyclin D3 overexpression and p16INK4A/pRb aberrations were mutually exclusive, supporting an oncogenic role for cyclin D3 in DLCL. p16INK4A inactivation, cyclin D3 overexpression, or aberrant pRb expression was identified in 18 of 34 DLCLs (53%). Combining these results with our previous p53 pathway studies showed that 82% of the de novo DLCLs had alterations of these pathways, and that both pathways were altered in 13 cases (38%). Low E2F-1 expression was associated with treatment failure (P = 0.020), and multivariate analysis of overall survival identified both low E2F-1 expression (relative risk = 6.9; P = 0.0037) and p16INK4A inactivation (relative risk = 3.3; P = 0.0247) as independent prognostic markers. These data support a role of E2F-1 as tumour suppressor gene in lymphoma and strongly suggest that the RB1 and p53 pathways are important in the development of de novo DLCL.

However, the large variability in ability to engraft and the levels of engraftment reached have not been explained. To address these issues we have investigated the NOD/SCID repopulating ability of 27 newly diagnosed AML samples. Patients were selected for the absence of internal tandem duplications in the Flt3 gene as we previously reported this mutation to be associated with an enhanced engraftment potential in this model. We observed that secondary AML (n = 6) had a significantly increased level of engraftment when compared to primary AML (n = 21, median levels 73.3% for secondary AML vs 8.94% for primary AML, P = 0.01). Within the primary AML, a significantly higher engraftment was observed in the FAB class M0 than in FAB classes M2, M4 and M5. Within primary AML, samples of patients who failed to respond to the initial therapy gave rise to a higher level of engraftment than samples of patients who did respond to therapy. A similar observation of an increased engraftment correlating with a poorer patient prognosis could be made when applying cytogenetic risk stratification. However, within the primary AML the most important clinical parameter correlating with the level of engraftment appeared to be the patient's WBC count at diagnosis (P = 0.0000). Covariate analysis with the WBC count as a covariate could also fully explain the differences observed in the cytogenetic risk groups, or on the basis of the initial therapy response. Although large differences could be observed, the ability to engraft the NOD/SCID mice was not linked to either the autonomous or cytokine-induced proliferation in vitro. As the leukemic cobblestone area-forming cell frequencies also revealed no correlation with repopulation in the NOD/SCID model, we consider it very likely that the level of engraftment reflects the in vivo proliferative ability of the AML samples assayed rather than the number of leukemia-initiating cells infused into the NOD/SCID mice. Phenotypic analysis based on the expression of CD33, CD34 and CD38 before and after passage in NOD/SCID showed that in 10 out of 16 samples investigated phenotypes were different. In summary, in addition to the Flt3 internal tandem duplications we have identified a series of clinical parameters that determine the NOD/SCID repopulating ability of AML samples, whilst our data strongly suggest that AML in NOD/SCID does not reflect the leukemic process in the patient.","['Rombouts, W J', 'Martens, A C', 'Ploemacher, R E']","['Rombouts WJ', 'Martens AC', 'Ploemacher RE']","['Department of Hematology, Erasmus University, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Animals', 'Antigens, CD/analysis', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Cell Division', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/classification/immunology/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mice, SCID', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Transplantation, Heterologous/immunology/*pathology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2000/05/10 09:00,2000/06/08 09:00,['2000/05/10 09:00'],"['2000/05/10 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/06/08 09:00 [medline]', '2000/05/10 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2401777 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 2000 May;14(5):889-97. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2401777.,"['0 (Antigens, CD)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, it has been unclear as to whether this is a selective process mediated by specific chemoattractant molecules, or simply a reflection of the highly motile nature of early B cell precursors. We further characterized this process using a transwell culture system, in which the two chambers were separated by an 8 microm diameter microporous membrane, through which leukemic cells could move. When a BMF layer was grown on the upper surface of the membrane there was an 84.1% reduction in transmigration of the human pre-B ALL cell line NALM-6 into the lower chamber, compared to control membrane with no BMF layer. Localization of leukemic cells under the BMF layer was confirmed ultrastructurally, suggesting the possibility that the migration of leukemic cells was directed by a chemotactic agent secreted by BMF. The involvement of the chemokine stromal cell-derived factor-1 (SDF-1) in this process was next investigated. BMF were shown to express m-RNA for SDF-1. Addition of SDF-1 at 100 ng/ml into the lower chamber increased transmigration of NALM-6 across the membrane by 2.2-fold, and also induced a 1.4- to 6.1-fold increase in movement of NALM-6 through a BMF layer into the lower chamber. The receptor for SDF-1, CXCR4, was demonstrated by flow cytometry on all 10 cases of precursor-B ALL analyzed, as well as on NALM-6, KM-3 and REH lines. An inhibitory antibody to CXCR4 was able to block the migration of NALM-6 cells into BMF monolayers grown on plastic by 51%, and in nine cases of ALL by 8-40%, as well as partially inhibit transmigration of leukemic cells through BMF layers along an SDF-1 concentration gradient. These results confirm that precursor-B ALL cells selectively localize within bone marrow stroma in vitro, and that this process is partially due to the stromal chemokine SDF-1 binding to its receptor CXCR4 on leukemic cells. SDF-1 may be important in influencing the localization of precursor-B ALL cells in marrow microenvironmental inches which regulate their survival and proliferation.","['Bradstock, K F', 'Makrynikola, V', 'Bianchi, A', 'Shen, W', 'Hewson, J', 'Gottlieb, D J']","['Bradstock KF', 'Makrynikola V', 'Bianchi A', 'Shen W', 'Hewson J', 'Gottlieb DJ']","['Department of Haematology, Westmead Hospital, NSW, Australia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Bone Marrow/*pathology', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/*pathology/*physiopathology', 'Cell Adhesion', 'Chemokine CXCL12', 'Chemokines, CXC/genetics/*pharmacology/*physiology', '*Chemotaxis/drug effects', 'Fibroblasts/pathology', 'Humans', 'Integrin alpha4beta1', 'Integrins/physiology', 'Receptors, CXCR4/drug effects/*physiology', 'Receptors, Lymphocyte Homing/physiology', 'Stromal Cells/pathology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2000/05/10 09:00,2000/06/08 09:00,['2000/05/10 09:00'],"['2000/05/10 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/06/08 09:00 [medline]', '2000/05/10 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2401729 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 2000 May;14(5):882-8. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2401729.,"['0 (CXCL12 protein, human)', '0 (Chemokine CXCL12)', '0 (Chemokines, CXC)', '0 (Integrin alpha4beta1)', '0 (Integrins)', '0 (Receptors, CXCR4)', '0 (Receptors, Lymphocyte Homing)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, we further characterized the effect of ATRA on the growth of CFU-GM stimulated by individual cytokines from multiple samples of CD34+ enriched or purified human bone marrow cells. The number of IL-3- or GM-CSF-induced CFU-GM with 3 x 10(-7) M ATRA was 3.25+/-1.13, and 2.17+/-0.8-fold greater respectively, compared to controls without ATRA, while G-CSF had no effect and the ratio of colony-induced with or without ATRA was 1.06+/-0.17 (P = 0.00012). No colonies grew with ATRA + IL-6 or ATRA without a cytokine. Maximum enhancing effect on IL-3-induced CFU-GM occurred when ATRA was added on day 2, gradually diminished when delaying ATRA, and in cultures of day 9 or older adding ATRA had no effect. In 14 days liquid cultures of purified CD34+ cells with IL-3, ATRA increased the number of myeloid differentiated cells to 91-95%, compared to 37-70% with IL-3 alone. In addition, the number of apoptotic cells using the annexin V method increased after 14 days from 5.1% with IL-3 to 17.1% with IL-3 + ATRA and by the TUNEL in situ method from 10-26% to 60-95%, respectively. This study demonstrates that ATRA consistently enhances the growth of myeloid progenitors from CD34+ cells. This effect is dependent on the stimulating cytokine, suggesting the myeloid cells responding to ATRA are the less mature CFU-GMs that are targets of IL-3 and GM-CSF and not the G-CSF-responding mature progenitors. The growth stimulation by ATRA and IL-3 is also associated with granulocyte differentiation and increased apoptosis. These studies further suggest a potential role of pharmacological doses of ATRA on the development of normal human hematopoietic cells.","['Douer, D', 'Ramezani, L', 'Parker, J', 'Levine, A M']","['Douer D', 'Ramezani L', 'Parker J', 'Levine AM']","['Department of Medicine, University of Southern California/Norris Comprehensive Cancer Center, Los Angeles 90033, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Antigens, CD34', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Bone Marrow Cells/*cytology', 'Cell Differentiation/*drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/pharmacology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology/*drug effects/physiology', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-3/pharmacology', 'Time Factors']",2000/05/10 09:00,2000/06/08 09:00,['2000/05/10 09:00'],"['2000/05/10 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/06/08 09:00 [medline]', '2000/05/10 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2401772 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 2000 May;14(5):874-81. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2401772.,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Interleukin-3)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",,,,['5P30CA14089/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Genetic studies in Drosophila indicated that cut plays an important role in cell-type specification in several tissues. In the present study, we have investigated CDP/Cut expression and activity in a panel of multipotent hematopoietic cell lines that can be induced to differentiate in vitro into distinct cell types. While CDP/Cut DNA binding activity declined in the pathways leading to macrophages, granulocytes and erythrocytes, it remained elevated in megakaryocytes. CDP/Cut was also highly expressed in primary megakaryocytes isolated from mouse, and some DNA binding activity could be detected. Altogether, these results raise the possibility that CDP/Cut may be a determinant of cell type identity downstream of the myelo-erythroid precursor cell. Another possibility, which does not exclude a role in lineage identity, is that CDP/Cut activity in megakaryocytes is linked to endomitosis. Indeed, elevated CDP/Cut activity in differentiating megakaryocytes and during the S phase of the cell cycle suggests that it may be required for DNA replication.","['Martin-Soudant, N', 'Drachman, J G', 'Kaushansky, K', 'Nepveu, A']","['Martin-Soudant N', 'Drachman JG', 'Kaushansky K', 'Nepveu A']","['Molecular Oncology Group, McGill University, Royal Victoria Hospital, Montreal, Quebec.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Animals', 'Bone Marrow Cells/cytology', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Drosophila Proteins', 'Drosophila melanogaster', 'Erythrocytes/*metabolism', 'Granulocytes/*metabolism', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology/metabolism', 'Homeodomain Proteins/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute', 'Macrophages/cytology/*metabolism', 'Megakaryocytes/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred Strains', 'Nerve Tissue Proteins', 'Nuclear Proteins/*metabolism', 'Repressor Proteins/*metabolism', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Transcription Factors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2000/05/10 09:00,2000/06/08 09:00,['2000/05/10 09:00'],"['2000/05/10 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/06/08 09:00 [medline]', '2000/05/10 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2401764 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 2000 May;14(5):863-73. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2401764.,"['0 (CUX1 protein, human)', '0 (Cux1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Drosophila Proteins)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (Nerve Tissue Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (ct protein, Drosophila)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",,,,"['K08 HL03498/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA31615/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 DK49855/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Chronic Leukemia Working Party of the European Blood and Marrow Transplant Registry.,859-62,"CML is characterized by the chromosomal translocation t(9;22) (q34;q11) resulting in the chimeric bcr-abl oncogene that encodes P210 fusion proteins with novel amino acid sequences in the breakpoint region. If these peptides derived from P210 are presented by HLA molecules on the cell membrane of leukemic cells an immunological response may occur. Recent studies using synthetic peptides identical to the bcr-abl fusion region revealed that some peptides are capable of binding to the class I molecules HLA-A2,-A3,-A11 and -B8 and the class II molecules HLA-DR1, -DR2, -DR3, -DR4 and -DR11. Moreover T cell responses have been induced against bcr-abl-derived synthetic peptides bound to some of these HLA molecules. For HLA class I, we have previously shown that individuals expressing HLA-A3 and -B8 have a diminished risk of development of CML. To assess a similar protective effect of class II molecules we performed a large multi-center study. This study compared the frequencies of HLA-DR1, -DR2, -DR3, -DR4 and -DR11 of patients with CML from the database of the EBMT (n = 1462) with unaffected individuals from the registry of Bone Marrow Donors Worldwide (n = 500 596). Patients and controls were matched per country. This analysis yielded significantly lower odds ratios (ORs) of 0.86 (95% CI 0.75-0.98) for HLA-DR3 and of 0.80 (95% CI 0.71-0.89) for HLA-DR4. The OR was 0.91 (95% CI 0.80-1.04) for HLA-DR1, 1.05 (95% CI 0.94-1.18) for HLA-DR2 and 0.87 (95% CI 0.74-1.01) for HLA-DR11. To assess a possible effect of the linkage disequilibrium between HLA-B8 and HLA-DR3 we found that coexpression of HLA-B8 and HLA-DR3 gave an OR of 0.84 (95% CI 0.72-0.98), whereas HLA-DR3 positive/HLA-B8 negative individuals showed an OR of 1.02 (95% CI 0.84-1.24). This means that the protective effect of HLA-DR3 of the development of CML was probably caused by its linkage disequilibrium with HLA-B8. In contrast, as there is no linkage disequilibrium of HLA-DR4 with HLA-A3 or HLA-B8, the results indicate that HLA-DR4 expression itself is associated with a diminished incidence of CML possibly by the presentation of bcr-abl breakpoint peptides in these HLA molecules on the membrane of the leukemic cells.","['Posthuma, E F', 'Falkenburg, J H', 'Apperley, J F', 'Gratwohl, A', 'Hertenstein, B', 'Schipper, R F', 'Oudshoorn, M', 'Biezen, J H', 'Hermans, J', 'Willemze, R', 'Roosnek, E', 'Niederwieser, D']","['Posthuma EF', 'Falkenburg JH', 'Apperley JF', 'Gratwohl A', 'Hertenstein B', 'Schipper RF', 'Oudshoorn M', 'Biezen JH', 'Hermans J', 'Willemze R', 'Roosnek E', 'Niederwieser D']","['Department of Hematology, Leiden University Medical Center, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Chromosome Mapping', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 22', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 9', 'Confidence Intervals', 'Databases as Topic', 'Europe/epidemiology', 'Gene Frequency', 'Genes, MHC Class I', 'Genes, MHC Class II', 'HLA-DR4 Antigen/analysis/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/epidemiology/*genetics/*immunology', 'Odds Ratio', 'Risk Factors', 'Translocation, Genetic']",2000/05/10 09:00,2000/06/08 09:00,['2000/05/10 09:00'],"['2000/05/10 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/06/08 09:00 [medline]', '2000/05/10 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2401774 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 2000 May;14(5):859-62. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2401774.,['0 (HLA-DR4 Antigen)'],,,,,['Leukemia. 2001 Jan;15(1):192-3.

Mabs directed against the cell surface antigens, CD19 and CD22 conjugated to deglycosylated ricin A chain (dgRTA) have been tested in patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL), but not in patients with pre-B ALL.

After 48 h in culture, cytotoxicity to tumor cells was determined by flow cytometry using propidium iodide (PI) and fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated anti-CD10, 19, and 22. Both RFB4-dgRTA and HD37-dgRTA induced a statistically significant reduction in the number of viable leukemic cells, and Combotox was even more effective.

However, little is known about the effect of temperature on the activity of wild-type BCR/ABL gene product. In this study, we demonstrate that in vivo tyrosine kinase activity of p210, p190 BCR/ABL and v-abl are temperature-sensitive when expressed in hematopoietic cells and decline when temperature is raised 2 degrees C above normal range. In vitro tyrosine kinase activities of purified recombinant Abl and immunoprecipitated p210 BCR/ABL were also sensitive to increased temperature. Tyrosine phosphorylation of cellular proteins was markedly reduced in BCR/ABL transformed cells after 16 h at 39 degrees C, whereas the expression of BCR/ABL was unchanged. Temperature-induced downregulation of BCR/ABL kinase activity was reversible when cells were shifted back to 37 degrees C. The downregulation of Abl tyrosine kinase activity was not influenced by mutation or deletion of SH2 or SH3 domains or mutation of the GRB2 binding site. No increase in functional activity or expression of protein-tyrosine phosphatases, PTP-1B, SH-PTP1 or SH-PTP2 was detected in cells grown at 39 degrees C. Temperature-induced downregulation in tyrosine kinase activity correlated with decline in phosphotyrosine-associated PI 3-kinase whereas there was no change in growth factor independence of transformed hematopoietic cells. In conclusion, Abl tyrosine kinase has intrinsic sensitivity to temperature and BCR/ABL expressed in hematopoietic cells is downregulated by increasing temperature 2 degrees C. These observations provide a unique opportunity to identify cellular factor(s) which regulate BCR/ABL kinase in vivo and suggests possible novel treatment of CML by a mild hyperthermia.","['Jain, S K', 'de Aos, I', 'Inai, Y', 'Liu, F', 'Varticovski, L']","['Jain SK', 'de Aos I', 'Inai Y', 'Liu F', 'Varticovski L']","[""Department of Medicine, St Elizabeth's Medical Center, Tufts University School of Medicine, Boston, MA 02135, USA.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['3T3 Cells', 'Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Line, Transformed', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics', 'Genes, abl', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology/*enzymology', 'Hot Temperature', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Mice', 'Oncogene Proteins v-abl/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/metabolism', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Recombinant Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/biosynthesis', 'Transfection', 'src Homology Domains']",2000/05/10 09:00,2000/06/08 09:00,['2000/05/10 09:00'],"['2000/05/10 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/06/08 09:00 [medline]', '2000/05/10 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2401759 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 2000 May;14(5):845-52. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2401759.,"['0 (Oncogene Proteins v-abl)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To determine the source of the limited sensitivity to CD95-mediated apoptosis, we isolated multiple clones from the RPMI-8226 cell line by limiting dilution. Analysis of these clones demonstrated that sensitivity to CD95-mediated cell death directly correlated with CD95 expression.

We further examined the sensitivity of the 8226 clones to various cytotoxic agents. Although modest clonal variability was demonstrated in response to the chemotherapeutic drugs, doxorubicin, etoposide (VP-16), and vincristine, there was no correlation between CD95 function and sensitivity to chemotherapeutic drugs.

The inhibition of cell proliferation involves cell growth arrest in the G1- and/or S-phase and eventually apoptotic cell death.

Three different protocols were defined to identify the normal subsets of B, T and myeloid cells in bone marrow (BM), and were applied to the different types of AL in order to study aberrant immunophenotypes. Using sensitive acquisition methods ('live gate') T cell subsets in normal BM could be identified with five triple-stains: CD7/CD5/CD3, CD7/CD4/CD8, CD7/CD2/CD3, CD7/CD38/CD34 and TdT/CD7/surface or cytoplasmic (cy)CD3 (antibodies conjugated with FITC/PE/PECy5 or PerCP, respectively). The identification of T cell subsets in BM allowed definition of 'empty spaces' (ie areas of flow cytometric plots where normally no cells are found). All studied T-ALL cases (n = 65) were located in 'empty spaces' and could be discriminated from normal T cells. The most informative triple staining was TdT/CD7/cyCD3, which was aberrant in 91% of T-ALL cases. In most cases, two or more aberrant patterns were found. Apparently the immunophenotypes of T-ALL differ significantly from normal BM T cells. This is mostly caused by their thymocytic origin, but also the neoplastic transformation might have affected antigen expression patterns. Application of the five proposed marker combinations in T-ALL contributes to standardized detection of MRD, since cells persistent or reappearing in the 'empty spaces' can be easily identified in follow-up BM samples during and after treatment.","['Porwit-MacDonald, A', 'Bjorklund, E', 'Lucio, P', 'van Lochem, E G', 'Mazur, J', 'Parreira, A', 'van den Beemd, M W', 'van Wering, E R', 'Baars, E', 'Gaipa, G', 'Biondi, A', 'Ciudad, J', 'van Dongen, J J', 'San Miguel, J F', 'Orfao, A']","['Porwit-MacDonald A', 'Bjorklund E', 'Lucio P', 'van Lochem EG', 'Mazur J', 'Parreira A', 'van den Beemd MW', 'van Wering ER', 'Baars E', 'Gaipa G', 'Biondi A', 'Ciudad J', 'van Dongen JJ', 'San Miguel JF', 'Orfao A']","['Department of Pathology, Karolinska Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Antigens, CD/*analysis', 'Biomarkers/analysis', 'Bone Marrow Cells/immunology/pathology', 'Flow Cytometry/methods/*standards', 'Humans', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*diagnosis/immunology/pathology', '*Neoplasm, Residual', 'Quality Control', 'T-Lymphocyte Subsets/*immunology/*pathology']",2000/05/10 09:00,2000/06/08 09:00,['2000/05/10 09:00'],"['2000/05/10 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/06/08 09:00 [medline]', '2000/05/10 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2401741 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 2000 May;14(5):816-25. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2401741.,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Biomarkers)']",,,,,['Leukemia. 2001 Aug;15(8):1301-3.

In order to further clarify the histogenetic derivation of this lymphoproliferation, we have analyzed the DNA sequences of the 5' non-coding region of BCL-6 proto-oncogene in 28 cases of B-CLL. Mutations of BCL-6 proto-oncogene, a zinc finger transcription factor implicated in lymphoma development, represent a histogenetic marker of B cell transit through the germinal center (GC) and occur frequently in B cell malignancies derived from GC or post-GC B cells. For comparison, the same tumor panel was analyzed for somatic mutations of the rearranged immunoglobulin variable (IgV) genes, which are known to be acquired at the time of B cell transit through the GC. Sequence analyses of BCL-6 and IgV genes allowed the definition of three groups of B-CLL. Group I B-CLL displayed mutations of both BCL-6 and IgV genes (10/28; 36%). Group II B-CLL displayed mutated IgV genes, but a germline BCL-6 gene (5/28; 18%). Finally, group III B-CLL included the remaining cases (13/28; 46%) that were characterized by the absence of somatic mutations of both BCL-6 and IgV genes. Overall, the distribution of BCL-6 and IgV mutations in B-CLL reinforce the notion that this leukemia is histogenetically heterogeneous and that a substantial subgroup of these lymphoproliferations derives from post-germinal center B cells.","['Capello, D', 'Fais, F', 'Vivenza, D', 'Migliaretti, G', 'Chiorazzi, N', 'Gaidano, G', 'Ferrarini, M']","['Capello D', 'Fais F', 'Vivenza D', 'Migliaretti G', 'Chiorazzi N', 'Gaidano G', 'Ferrarini M']","[""Department of Medical Sciences, 'Amedeo Avogadro' University of Eastern Piedmont, Novara.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Base Sequence', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics', 'Gene Rearrangement, B-Lymphocyte', 'Genes, Immunoglobulin', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/genetics', 'Immunoglobulin Light Chains/genetics', 'Immunoglobulin Variable Region/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*classification/*genetics/immunology', '*Mutation', 'Point Mutation', 'Proto-Oncogene Mas', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-6', 'Proto-Oncogenes', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Zinc Fingers']",2000/05/10 09:00,2000/06/08 09:00,['2000/05/10 09:00'],"['2000/05/10 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/06/08 09:00 [medline]', '2000/05/10 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2401766 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 2000 May;14(5):811-5. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2401766.,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Light Chains)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Variable Region)', '0 (MAS1 protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Mas)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-6)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In order to test the incidence and prognostic importance of this molecular marker, we have analyzed eight cases of AML with trisomy 11 and 387 unselected consecutive cases with AML for partial duplications of the MLL gene. Patients with normal karyotypes and those with various chromosome aberrations were included. De novo as well as secondary leukemias including all FAB subtypes were analyzed. Performing a one-step RT-PCR with 35 cycles using an exon 9 forward primer and an exon 3 reverse primer partial tandem duplications of the MLL gene were demonstrated in 3/8 (37.5%) patients with trisomy 11. In addition, 13/387 (3.4%) of unselected cases revealed a tandem duplication. Ten of these 13 cases were cytogenetically normal, the other three cases had < or =2 additional chromosomal alterations. Sequencing of the RT-PCR products of all 16 positive cases revealed fusions of MLL exon 9/exon 3 (e9/e3) (six cases), e10/e3 (three cases), e11/e3 (four cases) or combinations of differentially spliced e10/e3 and e11/e3 (three cases) transcripts. The duplications were confirmed by genomic long range PCR and Southern blot hybridization. Twelve cases with the MLL duplication were de novo myeloid leukemia, one was a secondary AML after MDS, three were therapy-related AML (t-AML). Of the 16 MLL-duplication positive cases, seven were classified as FAB M2, two as M1, five as M4, one as M0, one as M5b. The mean age was 62.3 years for patients with MLL duplication vs 50.3 years for the control group. Of 15 adult patients, 12 received treatment. Of these, three were nonresponders, five had early relapse (< or =6 months), four relapsed between 7 and 12 months. Median survival and relapse-free interval of the MLL duplication positive group was significantly worse than those of an age-matched karyotypically normal control group. In conclusion, MLL tandem duplications (1) are less common than previously reported; (2) are preferentially observed in AML with normal karyotypes, but can also be found in the presence of chromosome alterations; (3) are not strongly associated with an FAB subtype; (4) were not observed with the prognostically favorable t(8;21), inv(16), and t(15;17), other recurrent translocations, or in complex karyotypes; and (5) identifies a subgroup of patients with an unfavorable prognosis.","['Schnittger, S', 'Kinkelin, U', 'Schoch, C', 'Heinecke, A', 'Haase, D', 'Haferlach, T', 'Buchner, T', 'Wormann, B', 'Hiddemann, W', 'Griesinger, F']","['Schnittger S', 'Kinkelin U', 'Schoch C', 'Heinecke A', 'Haase D', 'Haferlach T', 'Buchner T', 'Wormann B', 'Hiddemann W', 'Griesinger F']","['Department of Hematology and Oncology, University of Gottingen, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Chromosome Mapping', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 11', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Exons', 'Female', '*Gene Duplication', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/*genetics/mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein', 'Prognosis', '*Proto-Oncogenes', 'Survival Analysis', '*Transcription Factors', 'Trisomy']",2000/05/10 09:00,2000/06/08 09:00,['2000/05/10 09:00'],"['2000/05/10 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/06/08 09:00 [medline]', '2000/05/10 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2401773 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 2000 May;14(5):796-804. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2401773.,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (KMT2A protein, human)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We studied the relationship between rapidity of reduction in peripheral blood blast count and treatment outcome in children with T cell ALL (T-ALL). Initial systemic chemotherapy included prednisone, vincristine, doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide. A Cox analysis evaluated the correlation between the length of time that the peripheral blood absolute blast count (ABC) remained above 1000/mm3 following the start of treatment and event-free survival (EFS). Data were available for 281 patients. Patients for whom the ABC remained >1000/mm3 for 3 or more days following administration of intensive therapy had an estimated 5-year EFS of 34.2% (s.e. = 7.2) vs 58.3% (3.5) for those whose ABC was <1000/mm3 within 0-2 days, with a hazard ratio (HR) of failure of 2.03 (95% CI = 1.35-3.06, P < 0.001) for the slower responding patients. Pre-treatment of some type (usually with prednisone) occurred in 128 patients (average duration 1.7 days). When this was accounted for, patients with an ABC >1000/mm3 for 5 or more days following the start of treatment of any kind had a HR for failure of 2.27 (95% CI = 1.38-3.72, P < 0.001) compared to those responding within 0-4 days. Inclusion of other clinical and biological factors in a multivariate analysis did not alter the prognostic importance of slower blast clearance. Pediatric patients with T-ALL who have a circulating blast count >1000/mm3 at diagnosis and a relatively slower response to initial treatment are at increased risk of treatment failure.

While there are a number of putative NK cell lines which are, however, either not characterized, not immortalized, non-malignant, non-NK, or plain false cell lines, six bona fide malignant NK cell lines have been established and are sufficiently well characterized: HANK1, KHYG-1, NK-92, NKL, NK-YS and YT. Except for YT which was derived from a not further defined acute lymphoblastic lymphoma, these cell lines were established from patients with various NK cell malignancies. Five of the six cell lines are constitutively interleukin-2-dependent. Their immunoprofile is remarkably similar: CD1-, CD2+, surface CD3 (but cytoplasmic CD3epsilon+), CD4-, CD5-, CD7+, CD8-, CD16-, CD56+, CD57-, TCRalphabeta-, TCRgammadelta-, negative for B cell and myelomonocytic markers. The immunoglobulin heavy chain and T cell receptor genes are all in germline configuration. All six lines show complex chromosomal alterations, with both numerical and structural aberrations, attesting to their malignant and monoclonal nature. Functionally, these cells which contain azurophilic granules in their cytoplasm are nearly universally positive in NK activity assays. Three of five cell lines are Epstein-Barr virus-positive (type II latency). The composite data on these six cell lines allow for the operational definition of a typical malignant NK cell line profile. NK leukemia-lymphoma cell lines will prove invaluable for studies of normal and malignant NK cell biology.","['Drexler, H G', 'Matsuo, Y']","['Drexler HG', 'Matsuo Y']","['DSMZ-German Collection of Microorganisms and Cell Cultures, Department of Human and Animal Cell Cultures, Braunschweig, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Antigens, CD/analysis', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*immunology/pathology', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/*immunology', 'Lymphoma, T-Cell/*immunology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2000/05/10 09:00,2000/06/08 09:00,['2000/05/10 09:00'],"['2000/05/10 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/06/08 09:00 [medline]', '2000/05/10 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2401778 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 2000 May;14(5):777-82. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2401778.,"['0 (Antigens, CD)']",55,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the mouse, there is a highly quiescent population of stem cells that lacks CD34 expression, but has full reconstituting capacity.

This information casts some uncertainty on the benefits of CD34+ cell isolation for stem cell transplantation, until more is known about the novel CD34-negative stem cell population.

Upon stimulation by its ligand, Mpl receptor induces proliferation and differentiation of hematopoietic cell lines of various origins. In this paper, we show that Mpl is also able to transform FRE rat fibroblasts in the presence of MGDF (pegylated Megakaryocyte Growth and Development Factor), a modified form of its ligand. We also demonstrate that upon MGDF stimulation Mpl receptor activates the classical transduction pathways described for hematopoietic cell lines in FRE cells. Introduction of Mpl deletion mutants in FRE cells allowed us to demonstrate that the C-terminal region of the Mpl intracytoplasmic domain, which is involved in hematopoietic differentiation, is necessary for the transformation process. Within that region, site-directed mutagenesis showed that the Y112 residue, which is required for Shc phosphorylation, is essential for rat fibroblast transformation by Mpl/MGDF, suggesting the involvement of Shc in Mpl-mediated transformation. Interestingly, we showed that transformation correlated with strong and sustained MAPK activation. Neither Jak2, Stat3 nor Stat5 phosphorylation was sufficient to induce the transformation process. Taken altogether, our results suggest the oncogenicity of Mpl in fibroblastic cells in the presence of its ligand.","['Challier, C', 'Cocault, L', 'Flon, M', 'Pauchard, M', 'Porteu, F', 'Gisselbrecht, S', 'Souyri, M']","['Challier C', 'Cocault L', 'Flon M', 'Pauchard M', 'Porteu F', 'Gisselbrecht S', 'Souyri M']","['Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale, U506, Hopital Paul Brousse, Villejuif, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,IM,"['3T3 Cells/metabolism/virology', '*Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing', '*Adaptor Proteins, Vesicular Transport', 'Animals', '*Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'Cytoplasm/metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/metabolism', 'Fibroblasts/drug effects/pathology', 'Genetic Vectors/genetics', 'Janus Kinase 2', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/genetics', 'Ligands', 'MAP Kinase Signaling System', 'Mice', '*Milk Proteins', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1/metabolism', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 3', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/metabolism', 'Mutation', '*Neoplasm Proteins', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/metabolism', 'Proteins/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Rats', 'Rats, Inbred Strains', '*Receptors, Cytokine', 'Receptors, Thrombopoietin', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor', 'STAT5 Transcription Factor', 'Shc Signaling Adaptor Proteins', 'Signal Transduction', 'Src Homology 2 Domain-Containing, Transforming Protein 1', 'Thrombopoietin/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Trans-Activators/metabolism']",2000/05/10 09:00,2000/06/08 09:00,['2000/05/10 09:00'],"['2000/05/10 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/06/08 09:00 [medline]', '2000/05/10 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.onc.1203472 [doi]'],ppublish,Oncogene. 2000 Apr 13;19(16):2033-42. doi: 10.1038/sj.onc.1203472.,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (Adaptor Proteins, Vesicular Transport)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Ligands)', '0 (Milk Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Cytokine)', '0 (Receptors, Thrombopoietin)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT5 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Shc Signaling Adaptor Proteins)', '0 (Shc1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Shc1 protein, rat)', '0 (Src Homology 2 Domain-Containing, Transforming Protein 1)', '0 (Stat3 protein, mouse)', '0 (Stat3 protein, rat)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '143641-95-6 (MPL protein, human)', '9014-42-0 (Thrombopoietin)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (JAK2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Jak2 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Jak2 protein, rat)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 2)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 3)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The HL-60 promyelocytic leukemia cell line was sensitive to H(2)O(2), and at concentrations up to about 20-25 micrometer, the killing was mediated by apoptosis. There was limited evidence of lipid peroxidation, suggesting that the effects of H(2)O(2) do not involve hydroxyl radical. When HL-60 cells were exposed to H(2)O(2) in the presence of the spin trap alpha-(4-pyridyl-1-oxide)-N-tert-butylnitrone (POBN), we detected a 12-line electron paramagnetic resonance spectrum assigned to the POBN/POBN(.) N-centered spin adduct previously described in peroxidase-containing cell-free systems. Generation of this radical by HL-60 cells had the same H(2)O(2) concentration dependence as initiation of apoptosis. In contrast, studies with the K562 human erythroleukemia cell line, which is often used for comparison with the HL-60, and with high passaged HL-60 cells (spent HL-60) studied under the same conditions failed to generate POBN(.). Cellular levels of antioxidant enzymes superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase, and catalase did not explain the differences between these cell lines. Interestingly, the K562 and spent HL-60 cells, which did not generate the radical, also failed to undergo H(2)O(2)-induced apoptosis. Based on this we reasoned that the difference in H(2)O(2)-induced apoptosis might be due to the enzyme myeloperoxidase. Only the apoptosis-manifesting HL-60 cells contained appreciable immunoreactive protein or enzymatic activity of this cellular enzyme. When HL-60 cells were incubated with methimazole or 4-aminobenzoic acid hydrazide, which are inhibitors of myeloperoxidase, they no longer underwent H(2)O(2)-induced apoptosis. Hypochlorous acid stimulated apoptosis in both HL-60 and spent HL-60 cells, indicating that another oxidant generated by myeloperoxidase induces apoptosis and that it may be the direct mediator of H(2)O(2)-induced apoptosis. Taken together these observations indicate that H(2)O(2)-induced apoptosis in the HL-60 human leukemia cell is mediated by myeloperoxidase and is linked to a non-Fenton oxidative event marked by POBN(.).","['Wagner, B A', 'Buettner, G R', 'Oberley, L W', 'Darby, C J', 'Burns, C P']","['Wagner BA', 'Buettner GR', 'Oberley LW', 'Darby CJ', 'Burns CP']","['Departments of Medicine and Radiology (Free Radical and Radiation Biology Graduate Program), The University of Iowa College of Medicine and The University of Iowa Cancer Center, Iowa City, Iowa 52242, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Enzyme Activation', 'HL-60 Cells/*metabolism/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Hydrogen Peroxide/*pharmacology', 'K562 Cells', 'Oxidants/*pharmacology', 'Peroxidase/*metabolism']",2000/05/10 09:00,2000/08/29 11:01,['2000/05/10 09:00'],"['2000/05/10 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/08/29 11:01 [medline]', '2000/05/10 09:00 [entrez]']","['10.1074/jbc.M001434200 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(19)79687-2 [pii]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2000 Jul 21;275(29):22461-9. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M001434200.,"['0 (Oxidants)', 'BBX060AN9V (Hydrogen Peroxide)', 'EC 1.11.1.7 (Peroxidase)']",,,,['P01 CA66081/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,['J Biol Chem 2001 Jun 29;276(26):24432'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

The primary endpoints of the study were toxicity of rhuIL-4 and the determination of the pharmacokinetics of rhuIL-4 when given by subcutaneous injection. Secondary endpoints included effects on blood counts, hematopoietic cell precursors, and various immunologic parameters. RESULTS: rhuIL-4 was well tolerated at all three dose levels. Detectable serum levels of IL-4 were found in patients at the 1.0 and 5.0 microg/kg/day dose levels. Peak serum IL-4 levels were achieved about 2 h after injection and IL-4 was still detectable 8 h after injection. No grade 4 toxicities were observed and grade 3 toxicities were confined to fever, headache and raised hepatic alkaline phosphatase. No consistent hematological or immunologic effects were observed. Although therapeutic efficacy was not an endpoint, one complete response (Hodgkin's disease) was observed. One patient with chronic lymphocytic leukemia progressed on therapy.

Several paraffin section antibodies immunoreact with mast cells but most are not specific. Tryptase, a specific marker of mast cells, may not be cost-effective to maintain in a laboratory because of the rarity of these lesions. This study was undertaken to assess the immunoreactivity of MCD and attempt to select a limited antibody panel for diagnosing MCD among hematopoietic tumors that morphologically mimic MCD. Immunophenotyping of cutaneous ( 10 cases) and extracutaneous (18 cases) MCD, as well as 94 other hematopoietic neoplasms, was performed on paraffin sections. All cases of MCD showed strong and diffuse positivity for CD68 and tryptase. In the vast majority of the cases, the mast cells were also positive for CD117 (27 of 28) and CD43 (25 of 27). Four cases (40%) of cutaneous MCD demonstrated a subpopulation of mast cells expressing myeloperoxidase (MPX), whereas all extracutaneous MCD were negative for MPX. Two (40%) extramedullary myeloid tumors (EMT) expressed CD43, CD68, CD 117, and MPX, but none expressed tryptase.

These sites are necessary for maximal activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK). Coexpression of catalytically inactive, but not wild-type, SHP-2 reduced LIFR- and gp130-mediated activation of MAPK up to 75%. Conversely, coexpression of the wild-type, but not catalytically inactive, SHP-1, a related phosphatase, reduced activity up to 80%, demonstrating that SHP-2 and SHP-1 have opposing effects on the MAPK pathway. Mutation of Y115 of the cytoplasmic domain of LIFR eliminates receptor-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation of SHP-2. In contrast, SHP-1 association with gp130 and LIFR is constitutive and independent of Y118 and Y115, respectively. SHP-1 has a positive regulatory role on LIF-stimulated vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) reporter gene expression in neuronal cells, whereas the effect of SHP-2 is negative. Furthermore, LIF-stimulated MAPK activation negatively regulates this VIP reporter gene induction. SHP-2 also negatively regulates LIF-dependent expression of choline acetyltransferase, but this regulation could be dissociated from its effects on MAPK activation. These data indicate that SHP-1 and SHP-2 are important regulators of LIF-dependent neuronal gene expression via both MAPK-dependent and -independent pathways.","['Bartoe, J L', 'Nathanson, N M']","['Bartoe JL', 'Nathanson NM']","['Department of Pharmacology, University of Washington, Seattle 98195-7750, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,J Neurochem,Journal of neurochemistry,2985190R,IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, CD/physiology', 'Binding Sites', 'COS Cells', 'Catalysis', 'Cell Line', 'Choline O-Acetyltransferase/metabolism', 'Cytokine Receptor gp130', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects/physiology', 'Gene Expression/*drug effects', 'Growth Inhibitors/*pharmacology', '*Interleukin-6', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Luciferases/metabolism', 'Lymphokines/*pharmacology', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/physiology', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors/*physiology', 'Neurons/*physiology', 'Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 11', 'Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 6', 'Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases/*physiology', 'Receptors, Cytokine/physiology', 'Receptors, OSM-LIF', 'Vasoactive Intestinal Peptide/metabolism']",2000/05/09 09:00,2000/06/08 09:00,['2000/05/09 09:00'],"['2000/05/09 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/06/08 09:00 [medline]', '2000/05/09 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1046/j.1471-4159.2000.0742021.x [doi]'],ppublish,J Neurochem. 2000 May;74(5):2021-32. doi: 10.1046/j.1471-4159.2000.0742021.x.,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Receptors, Cytokine)', '0 (Receptors, OSM-LIF)', '133483-10-0 (Cytokine Receptor gp130)', '37221-79-7 (Vasoactive Intestinal Peptide)', 'EC 1.13.12.- (Luciferases)', 'EC 2.3.1.6 (Choline O-Acetyltransferase)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 11)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 6)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases)']",,,,"['R01-NS30410/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States', 'T32-GM07727/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In particular, larger studies will be needed with appropriate randomization to determine if the response rate to genetically modified cells is equivalent to the response rates with unmodified cells. Wider application of these techniques in the initial setting of allogeneic transplantation will undoubtedly occur and such trials have been initiated at several institutions. Careful attention to vector, suicide gene, selectable marker, efficiency of transduction, and cell dose will be necessary when comparing different trials since these variables will probably affect transgenic cell survival and response rates.

This type of strategy should be explored initially in patients considered ineligible for conventional myeloablative therapies either because of age or concurrent medical conditions. GVHD remains a major obstacle that needs to be overcome. Although a potentially lower level of inflammatory cytokines may be present after non-myeloablative therapies, fatal GVHD still occurs. Methods to diminish GVHD after allogeneic transplant include selective T-cell depletion (39-43) and transduction of donor T-cells with Herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase which renders these cells sensitive to ganciclovir treatment (see chapter 16). We and others have demonstrated that nonablative chemotherapy using fludarabine combinations is sufficiently immunosuppressive to allow engraftment of allogeneic blood progenitor cells. Patients could then receive graded doses of donor lymphocytes without rejection, to mediate GVL. Ideally, this therapy could be titrated to levels of residual malignant cells using sensitive detection techniques. This novel approach to therapy would reduce the toxicity of the transplant procedure, allow it to be administered more safely to debilitated patients and possibly extend the use of transplantation to older patients who are not presently eligible for BMT procedures. Other possible indications include treatment of non-malignant disorders and induction of tolerance for solid organ transplantation.","['Giralt, S', 'Khouri, I', 'Champlin, R']","['Giralt S', 'Khouri I', 'Champlin R']","['University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Cancer Treat Res,Cancer treatment and research,8008541,IM,"['Graft vs Host Disease/prevention & control', 'Graft vs Leukemia Effect', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*therapy', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*methods', 'Humans', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/therapeutic use', 'Vidarabine/analogs & derivatives/therapeutic use']",2000/05/09 09:00,2000/07/08 11:00,['2000/05/09 09:00'],"['2000/05/09 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/07/08 11:00 [medline]', '2000/05/09 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Treat Res. 1999;101:97-108.,"['0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'P2K93U8740 (fludarabine)']",44,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The Chronic Myeloid Leukemia Subcommittee of the GETH. Grupo Espanol de Trasplante Hemopoyetico.,530-8,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: To analyze the results of unrelated bone marrow transplantation (UDBMT) as treatment for chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) in Spain. DESIGN AND METHODS: Eighty-seven consecutive UDBMT performed in 9 centers between October 1989 and February 1998 were evaluated. This represents more than 95% of UDBMT for CML performed in adult transplant centers in Spain during this period. The patients' median age was 31.5 years (range, 12-49). The median interval from CML diagnosis to UDBMT was 30 months (range, 3-160). Seventy-nine percent of transplants were performed during the first chronic phase (1CP). RESULTS: Actuarial probability of survival and disease-free survival at 4 years for the whole series was 24% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 14%-34%) and 20% (CI: 10%-30%), respectively. The cumulative incidence of relapse and transplant-related mortality (TRM) was 7% (CI: 4%-10%) and 71% (CI: 60%-82%), respectively. The main causes of death were graft failure (n=7), infection (n=23), and graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) (n=25). The actuarial probability of acute GvHD grade II-IV and grade III-IV was 56% (CI:46%-66%) and 36% (CI: 26%-36%), respectively. The cumulative incidence of extensive chronic GvHD was 18% (CI: 9%-27%). Univariate analyses showed that the pre-transplant factor with the highest influence on survival was disease status at transplant (30% in 1CP vs. 0% in advanced phases; p=0.0001). Other pre-transplant factors influencing survival among patients in 1CP were: patient's age (older than 30 years 11% vs. 48%), interval diagnosis-transplantation (longer than 2 years 17% vs. 55%), donor type (HLA, B, DRB1 identical 32% vs. 25%), CMV serologic status (donor and recipient negative 63% vs. 24%), year of transplantation (before 1995 19% vs. 40%), and conditioning regimen (cyclophosphamide plus total body radiation 40% vs. 16%). The main risk factors had a cumulative effect on survival. Thus, probability of survival ranged from 66% (CI: 39%-93%) in patients in 1CP, under 40 years of age, transplanted from an HLA, A, B, DRB1 identical donor during the first two years after diagnosis, to 0% in those with three or more risk factors. INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: This experience shows that UDBMT used to have a high TRM that has progressively decreased along the years. At the present time, the results are encouraging, particularly when UDBMT is performed under favorable conditions.","['Carreras, E', 'Tomas, J F', 'Sanz, G', 'Iriondo, A', 'Boque, C', 'Lopez, J', 'Cabrera, R', 'Sureda, A', 'de Soria, V G', 'Sierra, J', 'Sanz, M A', 'Torres, A']","['Carreras E', 'Tomas JF', 'Sanz G', 'Iriondo A', 'Boque C', 'Lopez J', 'Cabrera R', 'Sureda A', 'de Soria VG', 'Sierra J', 'Sanz MA', 'Torres A']","['BMT Section, Hematology Department, Hospital Clinic, Villarroel 170, 08036 Barcelona, Spain. carreras@clinic.ub.es']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,IM,"['Actuarial Analysis/statistics & numerical data', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/*adverse effects/mortality/*statistics & numerical data', 'Child', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Graft Survival', 'Graft vs Host Disease', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/complications/epidemiology/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Recurrence', 'Spain/epidemiology', 'Survival Rate', 'Tissue Donors']",2000/05/09 09:00,2000/09/02 11:01,['2000/05/09 09:00'],"['2000/05/09 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/09/02 11:01 [medline]', '2000/05/09 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Haematologica. 2000 May;85(5):530-8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although developmental overlaps between natural killer cells and T-cells have been described, malignancies derived from these two cell types are considered as distinct lymphoid disorders. DESIGN AND METHODS: We report the case of a 30-year old man affected by a lymphoma/leukemia syndrome presenting with hepatosplenic lymphoma which rapidly transformed into aggressive NK-leukemia. Extensive flow cytometry studies and molecular analysis were repeated during the course of the disease, and showed an unexpected changing pattern. RESULTS: At diagnosis, flow cytometry analysis showed the co-existence of two cell populations, one CD56(+), CD3(+), TcRgd(+), and the other CD56(+), CD3(-) and TcRgd(-). Molecular analysis showed that the TcR genes had the same clonally rearranged pattern involving b, g and d genes in both populations. At disease relapse and during the terminal refractory phase, only CD3(-) cells were present. INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: This is an unusual case of CD56(+) aggressive lymphoma/leukemia characterized by the clonal expansion of two phenotypically different cell populations, variably balanced during the course of the disease. The presence of the same TcR genomic rearrangement suggests the origin from a common progenitor able to differentiate along both T- and NK-pathways.","['Camera, A', 'Pezzullo, L', 'Villa, M R', 'Luciano, L', 'Pane, F', 'Izzo, B', 'Boccuni, P', 'Di Noto, R', 'Del Vecchio, L', 'Salvatore, F', 'Rotoli, B']","['Camera A', 'Pezzullo L', 'Villa MR', 'Luciano L', 'Pane F', 'Izzo B', 'Boccuni P', 'Di Noto R', 'Del Vecchio L', 'Salvatore F', 'Rotoli B']","['Divisione di Ematologia, Ospedale A.

Gruppo Italiano Malattie Mieloproliferative Croniche(GIMMC).,492-5,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Diagnostic criteria for essential thrombocythemia (ET) remain essentially negative, that is, exclusion of other myeloproliferative diseases and causes of reactive thrombocytosis. A platelet count above 600x10(9)/L is still generally considered an absolute diagnostic criterion although new protocols for positive diagnostic criteria have recently been proposed, reducing the stringency of a definite platelet limit. This study demonstrates that a platelet count 600x10(9)/L is not a reliable diagnostic criterion for ET, especially in the early stages. DESIGN AND METHODS: An ongoing retrospective study by the GIMMC analyzed 2,316 ET patients diagnosed between 1986 and 1995. Of these 2,316 patients, diagnosed according to the PVSG criteria, 68 had a platelet count 600x10(9)/L and were analyzed separately; 37 out of 68 were excluded from this analysis because of a follow-up shorter than 2 years and/or because of treatment with myelosuppressive agents. The remaining 31 patients were the subjects of our study. RESULTS: After a median follow-up of 4.56 years (range 2-9.6 years) none of the 31 patients had a spontaneous decrease of platelets to the normal range. Transformation to a different chronic myeloproliferative disorders was never observed and no patient developed a condition known to produce reactive thrombocytosis. During follow-up, 23 patients (74%) were treated with anti-aggregating drugs, mainly aspirin. The disease did not evolve into acute leukemia in any patient, 1 had a thrombotic event and none presented hemorrhagic episodes. Median platelet count during follow-up was 534x10(9)/L (range 398-997x10(9)/L). INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: Long term follow-up has documented that our 31 patients were correctly diagnosed as having ET, although platelet count was 600x10(9)/L. Our patients were probably in a early phase of their disease and following updated PVSG criteria would have been misdiagnosed leading to incomplete recognition of the natural history of the disease. Further, because an early diagnosis could also have a clinical relevance, our results outline the need for new criteria for the diagnosis of ET. The exclusion of patients with a platelet count between 400 and 600x10(9)/L may prevent patients, nevertheless at risk of vascular complications, from being treated.","['Sacchi, S', 'Vinci, G', 'Gugliotta, L', 'Rupoli, S', 'Gargantini, L', 'Martinelli, V', 'Baravelli, S', 'Lazzarino, M', 'Finazzi, G']","['Sacchi S', 'Vinci G', 'Gugliotta L', 'Rupoli S', 'Gargantini L', 'Martinelli V', 'Baravelli S', 'Lazzarino M', 'Finazzi G']","['Dipartimento di Scienze Mediche, Oncologiche e Radiologiche, via del Pozzo 71,41100 Modena, Italy. ssacchi@unimo.it']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Diagnostic Techniques and Procedures', 'Disease Progression', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Platelet Count', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Thrombocythemia, Essential/blood/complications/*diagnosis']",2000/05/09 09:00,2000/09/02 11:01,['2000/05/09 09:00'],"['2000/05/09 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/09/02 11:01 [medline]', '2000/05/09 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Haematologica. 2000 May;85(5):492-5.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Pericentric inversion of chromosome 16 and translocation t(16;16) resulting in chimeric fusion of CBFB and MYH11 genes are typically seen in the M4-Eo FAB classification subset of AML and are associated with low-risk disease. These subtle chromosomal abnormalities may be difficult to detect in poor-quality metaphase preparations and if missed could lead to incorrect assignment to risk groups and influence the therapy decision-making process. DESIGN AND METHODS: We prospectively studied, at diagnosis, 10 patients with AML-M4 Eo by cytogenetics and fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) with two cosmids (36 and 40). As a control group, 7 patients (5 with a diagnosis of AML other than M4 Eo and two cases of reactive eosinophilia) were analyzed. In addition reverse transcriptase chain reaction (RT-PCR) studies were carried out in 6 cases. RESULTS: Karyotypic analysis detected the inv(16) in all but one of the patients with M4-Eo while none of the control cases showed any abnormality on chromosome 16. FISH studies showed that all 10 patients had abnormalities on chromosome 16; the patient with normal karyotype showed an inv(16) by FISH, while a case with inv(16) by cytogenetics had a t(16;16) by FISH. RT-PCR demonstrated amplification of the CBFB/MYH11 product in all cases analyzed. INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: In patients with M4Eo and rearrangements of chromosome 16, FISH studies may afford more complete information than conventional cytogenetics and can be an alternative to RT-PCR studies.","['Hernandez, J M', 'Gonzalez, M B', 'Granada, I', 'Gutierrez, N', 'Chillon, C', 'Ramos, F', 'Ribera, J M', 'Gonzalez, M', 'Feliu, E', 'San Miguel, J']","['Hernandez JM', 'Gonzalez MB', 'Granada I', 'Gutierrez N', 'Chillon C', 'Ramos F', 'Ribera JM', 'Gonzalez M', 'Feliu E', 'San Miguel J']","['Servicio de Hematologia, Hospital Universitario de Salamanca, Paseo San Vicente 58-182, 37007 Salamanca, Spain. jmhernandezr@aehh.org']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Child', '*Chromosome Inversion', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 16/*genetics', 'Cytogenetic Analysis', 'Eosinophilia/genetics', 'Female', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence/*standards', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Acute/classification/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', '*Translocation, Genetic']",2000/05/09 09:00,2000/09/02 11:01,['2000/05/09 09:00'],"['2000/05/09 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/09/02 11:01 [medline]', '2000/05/09 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Haematologica. 2000 May;85(5):481-5.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The aim of this study was to search for a possible involvement of HHV-6 in the pathogenesis of hematologic diseases. DESIGN AND METHODS: The presence of HHV-6 DNA sequences was examined by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in bone marrow mononuclear cells from 241 patients with benign and malignant hematologic diseases in China. Platelet-associated immunoglobulin (PAIg) of 66 idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) patients was measured by competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The presence of HHV-6 DNA in sera from 31 ITP patients was examined by PCR. Paired serum samples from 19 ITP patients were analyzed for anti-HHV-6 IgG titers using an indirect immunofluorescence assay. RESULTS: HHV-6 DNA was detected in 41% and 37.5% of ITP and acute leukemia patients respectively, but in only 6.7% of patients with iron deficiency anemia. HHV-6 positivity for ITP patients with excessive PAIgG was significantly higher than in patients with a normal level of PAIgG. HHV-6 DNA was not detected in any of the serum samples from ITP patients. None of the 19 cases of ITP showed a significant increase in anti-HHV-6 antibody titers during the convalescent phase compared with the onset phase. INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that HHV-6 infection might be associated with excessive PAIgG in some cases of ITP, and that the virus persists in a latent state. The pathogenic role of HHV-6 in ITP needs to be confirmed by further investigations.","['Ma, X T', 'Song, Y H', 'Lu, D M', 'Mu, G F', 'Li, G', 'Ji, L X', 'Yang, R C', 'Wu, K F']","['Ma XT', 'Song YH', 'Lu DM', 'Mu GF', 'Li G', 'Ji LX', 'Yang RC', 'Wu KF']","['National Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, Peking Union Medical College, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Tianjin, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Anemia, Iron-Deficiency/virology', 'Autoantibodies/blood', 'Blood Platelets/immunology', 'Bone Marrow Cells/metabolism/virology', 'China/epidemiology', 'DNA, Viral/blood', 'Female', 'Hematologic Diseases/epidemiology/*virology', 'Herpesviridae Infections/complications', 'Herpesvirus 6, Human/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin G/blood', 'Leukemia/virology', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/virology', 'Male', 'Purpura, Thrombocytopenic, Idiopathic/virology']",2000/05/09 09:00,2000/09/02 11:01,['2000/05/09 09:00'],"['2000/05/09 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/09/02 11:01 [medline]', '2000/05/09 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Haematologica. 2000 May;85(5):458-63.,"['0 (Autoantibodies)', '0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (Immunoglobulin G)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A variety of experiments have implicated DNA methylation and histone deacetylation in gene silencing and shown that the agents 5-azacytidine (5-Aza) and trichostatin A (TSA) are able to reverse these effects. To begin to investigate clinically relevant strategies to reverse silencing with these drugs, we transduced the MEL and FDCP-1 hematopoietic cell lines with Moloney murine leukemia virus (MMLV) and Harvey murine sarcoma virus (HMSV)-based retroviral vectors carrying the beta-galactosidase/neomycin resistance fusion gene (beta-geo). Fifty-one clones were isolated under G418 selection over 2 weeks and then allowed to grow without selection as beta-gal activity was monitored over time. More than 80% of these clones showed significant silencing over a period of 70-80 days. The clones were then exposed to a wide range of 5-Aza and TSA concentrations, both alone and in combination, in an effort to reverse silencing. Despite demonstration that the agents were able to decrease DNA methylation and increase histone acetylation, significant reversal of long-term silencing was not seen under any experimental condition. These results suggest that long-term retroviral silencing involves mechanisms in addition to DNA methylation and histone acetylation and that new pharmacologic strategies are needed to overcome the silencing process.","['McInerney, J M', 'Nawrocki, J R', 'Lowrey, C H']","['McInerney JM', 'Nawrocki JR', 'Lowrey CH']","['Department of Medicine, Dartmouth Medical School, Hanover, NH, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Gene Ther,Gene therapy,9421525,IM,"['Acetylation', 'Acetyltransferases/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Azacitidine/therapeutic use', 'Cell Line', 'DNA Methylation/drug effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Resistance', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/therapeutic use', 'Gene Silencing/*drug effects', 'Genetic Therapy/*methods', 'Genetic Vectors/*genetics', '*Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors', 'Histones/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Hydroxamic Acids/*therapeutic use', 'Retroviridae/*genetics', 'Treatment Failure', 'beta-Galactosidase/genetics']",2000/05/09 09:00,2000/06/10 09:00,['2000/05/09 09:00'],"['2000/05/09 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/06/10 09:00 [medline]', '2000/05/09 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.gt.3301155 [doi]'],ppublish,Gene Ther. 2000 Apr;7(8):653-63. doi: 10.1038/sj.gt.3301155.,"['0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors)', '0 (Histones)', '0 (Hydroxamic Acids)', '3X2S926L3Z (trichostatin A)', 'EC 2.3.1.- (Acetyltransferases)', 'EC 3.2.1.23 (beta-Galactosidase)', 'M801H13NRU (Azacitidine)']",,,,"['F32 HL10083/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL52243/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

On the other hand, ATP depletion has been reported to induce apoptosis accompanying DNA fragmentation. To address this apparent paradox, we analyzed the DNA-fragmenting activity generated in ATP-depleted cells. In HL-60 promyelocytic leukemia cells cultured in glucose-free medium with oligomycin, internucleosomal DNA fragmentation occurred as an early event. The DNA fragmentation was blocked by serine protease inhibitors but not by caspase inhibitors. Consistently, ICAD/DFF45 could not inhibit the DNA-fragmenting activity of the ATP-depleted cytosol in a cell-free system. When ATP was supplied to the cell-free assay, 80% of the DNA-fragmenting activity was lost. The reduced activity was then restored by proteasome inhibitors, suggesting a role of proteasome to protect from a cellular insult derived from ATP-depletion.","['Nakamura, N', 'Wada, Y']","['Nakamura N', 'Wada Y']","['Department of Molecular Medicine, Osaka Medical Center and Research Institute for Maternal and Child Health, 840 Murodo-cho, Izumi, Osaka 594-1101, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Cell Death Differ,Cell death and differentiation,9437445,IM,"['Adenosine Triphosphate/*metabolism', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins', 'Base Sequence', 'Caspase Inhibitors', 'Cell-Free System', 'Cysteine Endopeptidases/metabolism', 'Cysteine Proteinase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Cytosol/metabolism', 'DNA Fragmentation/drug effects/*physiology', 'DNA Primers/genetics', 'Deoxyribonucleases/metabolism', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins', 'Multienzyme Complexes/metabolism', 'Nucleosomes/metabolism', 'Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex', 'Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Serine Proteinase Inhibitors/pharmacology']",2000/05/09 09:00,2000/08/01 11:00,['2000/05/09 09:00'],"['2000/05/09 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/08/01 11:00 [medline]', '2000/05/09 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.cdd.4400677 [doi]'],ppublish,Cell Death Differ. 2000 May;7(5):477-84. doi: 10.1038/sj.cdd.4400677.,"['0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (Caspase Inhibitors)', '0 (Cysteine Proteinase Inhibitors)', '0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Multienzyme Complexes)', '0 (Nucleosomes)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (Serine Proteinase Inhibitors)', '0 (caspase-activated DNase inhibitor)', '8L70Q75FXE (Adenosine Triphosphate)', 'EC 3.1.- (Deoxyribonucleases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Cysteine Endopeptidases)', 'EC 3.4.25.1 (Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The current paradigm for activation of cPLA2 by stimuli proposes that both an increase in intracellular calcium and mitogen-activated protein kinase-mediated phosphorylation occur together to fully activate the enzyme. Calcium is currently thought to be needed for translocation of the cPLA2 to the membrane via a C2 domain, whereas the role of cPLA2 phosphorylation is less clearly defined. Herein, we report that brief exposure of P388D1 macrophages to UV radiation results in a rapid, cPLA2-mediated arachidonic acid mobilization, without increases in intracellular calcium. Thus, increased Ca2+ availability is a dispensable signal for cPLA2 activation, which suggests the existence of alternative mechanisms for the enzyme to efficiently interact with membranes. Our previous in vitro data suggested the importance of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PtdInsP2) in the association of cPLA2 to model membranes and hence in the regulation of cPLA2 activity.

Moreover, inhibition of PtdInsP2 formation during activation conditions leads to inhibition of the cPLA2-mediated arachidonic acid mobilization.

The lambda 5 and VpreB polypeptides together with the Ig mu H chain and the signal-transducing subunits, Ig alpha and Ig beta, comprise the pre-B cell receptor. To further investigate the pro-B/pre-B-specific transcription regulation of hu lambda 5 in an in vivo model, we generated mouse lines that contain a 28-kb genomic fragment encompassing the entire hu lambda 5 gene. High levels of expression of the transgenic hu lambda 5 gene were detected in bone marrow pro-B and pre-B cells at the mRNA and protein levels, suggesting that the 28-kb transgene fragment contains all the transcriptional elements necessary for the stage-specific B progenitor expression of hu lambda 5. Flow cytometric and immunoprecipitation analyses of bone marrow cells and Abelson murine leukemia virus-transformed pre-B cell lines revealed the hu lambda 5 polypeptide on the cell surface and in association with mouse Ig mu and mouse VpreB. Finally, we found that the hu lambda 5 transgene is able to rescue the pre-B lymphocyte block when bred onto the m lambda 5-/- background. Therefore, we conclude that the hu lambda 5 polypeptide can biochemically and functionally substitute for m lambda 5 in vivo in pre-B lymphocyte differentiation and proliferation. These studies on the mouse and human pre-B cell receptor provide a model system to investigate some of the molecular requirements necessary for B cell development.","['Donohoe, M E', 'Beck-Engeser, G B', 'Lonberg, N', 'Karasuyama, H', 'Riley, R L', 'Jack, H M', 'Blomberg, B B']","['Donohoe ME', 'Beck-Engeser GB', 'Lonberg N', 'Karasuyama H', 'Riley RL', 'Jack HM', 'Blomberg BB']","['Department of Microbiology, University of Miami School of Medicine, Miami, FL 33101, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,IM,"['Abelson murine leukemia virus/genetics', 'Animals', 'B-Lymphocyte Subsets/cytology/*immunology/metabolism', 'Binding Sites, Antibody/genetics', 'Bone Marrow Cells/immunology/metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation/genetics/immunology', 'Cell Lineage/genetics/immunology', 'Crosses, Genetic', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation/immunology', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/metabolism', 'Immunoglobulin Light Chains', 'Immunoglobulin Light Chains, Surrogate', 'Immunoglobulin lambda-Chains/biosynthesis/*genetics/metabolism', 'Immunoglobulin mu-Chains/metabolism', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Male', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/biosynthesis/*genetics/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell/biosynthesis/genetics/metabolism', 'Stem Cells/cytology/immunology/metabolism', 'Testis/immunology/metabolism', 'Thymus Gland/immunology/metabolism', 'Transgenes/*immunology']",2000/05/09 09:00,2000/06/10 09:00,['2000/05/09 09:00'],"['2000/05/09 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/06/10 09:00 [medline]', '2000/05/09 09:00 [entrez]']","['ji_v164n10p5269 [pii]', '10.4049/jimmunol.164.10.5269 [doi]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 2000 May 15;164(10):5269-76. doi: 10.4049/jimmunol.164.10.5269.,"['0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Light Chains)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Light Chains, Surrogate)', '0 (Immunoglobulin lambda-Chains)', '0 (Immunoglobulin mu-Chains)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell)']",,,,"['AG 15474/AG/NIA NIH HHS/United States', 'R03 AG14892/AG/NIA NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Following ultracentrifugation, the activity in the >/=500-kDa fraction was concentrated in the pellet (FasL vector preparation (VP)), which was also infective when added to NIH-3T3 cells. Both Polybrene and poly-l -lysine significantly enhanced the cytotoxicity of FasL VP but not anti-Fas mAb, soluble FasL (sFasL), and cell-associated FasL. In the presence of Polybrene, FasL VP killed targets that are resistant to anti-Fas mAb and sFasL. The infectivity but not FasL cytotoxicity of FasL VP was sensitive to irradiation and heat shock. By contrast, cytotoxicity of FasL VP could be enhanced or inhibited depending on the doses of anti-FasL mAb. Interestingly, the infectivity of FasL VP was specifically enhanced by anti-FasL mAb, suggesting that a nonviral gene product could be used to regulate the behavior of the retroviral vector. Thus, in addition to expressing potent FasL cytotoxicity, the FasL VP exhibits unique properties heretofore not attributed to anti-Fas mAb, sFasL, and cell-associated FasL.

The development of these immune responses is dependent on the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) (H-2) genotype of the mouse. In H-2(b/b) mice, which spontaneously recover from FV-induced erythroleukemia, neutralization of gamma interferon (IFN-gamma) in vivo inhibited recovery, which indicated that IFN-gamma was a necessary component of the immune response to FV. Furthermore, in H-2(b/b) mice, high numbers of IFN-gamma-producing cells were detected after FV infection, whereas in H-2(a/b) mice, which have a low-recovery phenotype, only low numbers of IFN-gamma-producing cells were detected. Similarly, H-2(bm14/b) mice, which cannot recover from FV infection due to a point mutation in one allele of the H-2D(b) gene, also had low numbers of IFN-gamma-producing T cells. Surprisingly, this effect was observed for both CD8(+) and CD4(+) T cells. These findings reveal a novel influence of MHC class I genes on CD4(+) T-cell responses to viral infection. Furthermore, the influence of MHC class I genotype on the generation of both IFN-gamma-producing CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells helps explain the major impact of the H-2D gene on recovery from FV disease.","['Peterson, K E', 'Iwashiro, M', 'Hasenkrug, K J', 'Chesebro, B']","['Peterson KE', 'Iwashiro M', 'Hasenkrug KJ', 'Chesebro B']","['Laboratory of Persistent Viral Diseases, Rocky Mountain Laboratories, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Hamilton, Montana 59840, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,IM,"['Animals', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/*immunology/virology', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/*immunology/virology', 'Friend murine leukemia virus/*immunology', 'H-2 Antigens/*genetics', 'Histocompatibility Antigen H-2D', 'Interferon-gamma/*biosynthesis', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*immunology', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Mice', 'Point Mutation', 'Retroviridae Infections/*immunology', 'Spleen/cytology/immunology', 'Splenomegaly/immunology', 'Tumor Virus Infections/*immunology']",2000/05/09 09:00,2000/07/06 11:00,['2000/05/09 09:00'],"['2000/05/09 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/07/06 11:00 [medline]', '2000/05/09 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/jvi.74.11.5363-5367.2000 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 2000 Jun;74(11):5363-7. doi: 10.1128/jvi.74.11.5363-5367.2000.,"['0 (H-2 Antigens)', '0 (Histocompatibility Antigen H-2D)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)']",,PMC110893,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

S-HDAg is required for replication of HDV, while L-HDAg inhibits viral replication and is required for the envelopment of the HDV genomic RNA by hepatitis B virus proteins. Here we have examined the spatial distribution of HDV RNA and proteins in infected nuclei, with particular reference to specific nuclear domains. We found that L-HDAg was aggregated in specific nuclear domains and that over half of these domains were localized beside nuclear domain 10 (ND10). At later times, ND10-associated proteins like PML were found in larger HDAg complexes that had developed into apparently hollow spheres. In these larger complexes, PML was found chiefly in the rims of the spheres, while the known ND10 components Sp100, Daxx, and NDP55 were found in the centers of the spheres. Thus, ND10 proteins that normally are closely linked separate within HDAg-associated complexes. Viral RNA of antigenomic polarity, whether expressed from genomic RNA or directly from introduced plasmids, colocalizes with L-HDAg and the transcriptional repressor PML. In contrast, HDV genomic RNA was distributed more uniformly throughout the nucleus. These results suggest that different host protein complexes may assemble on viral RNA strands of different polarities, and they also suggest that this RNA virus, like DNA viruses, can alter the distribution of ND10-associated proteins. The fact that viral components specifically linked to repression of replication can associate with one of the ND10-associated proteins (PML) raises the possibility that this host protein may play a role in the regulation of HDV RNA synthesis.","['Bell, P', 'Brazas, R', 'Ganem, D', 'Maul, G G']","['Bell P', 'Brazas R', 'Ganem D', 'Maul GG']","['The Wistar Institute, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19104, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,IM,"['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing', 'Amino Acid Sequence', '*Antigens, Nuclear', 'Autoantigens/metabolism', 'Binding Sites', 'Carrier Proteins/metabolism', 'Cell Nucleus/metabolism/*virology', 'Co-Repressor Proteins', 'Hepatitis Antigens/*metabolism', '*Hepatitis Delta Virus/genetics/immunology/physiology', 'Hepatitis delta Antigens', 'Humans', '*Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins', 'Macromolecular Substances', 'Molecular Chaperones', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Neoplasm Proteins/metabolism', 'Nuclear Proteins/metabolism', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'RNA, Viral/*metabolism', 'SUMO-1 Protein', 'Transcription Factors/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins', 'Ubiquitins/metabolism', '*Virus Replication']",2000/05/09 09:00,2000/07/06 11:00,['2000/05/09 09:00'],"['2000/05/09 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/07/06 11:00 [medline]', '2000/05/09 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/jvi.74.11.5329-5336.2000 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 2000 Jun;74(11):5329-36. doi: 10.1128/jvi.74.11.5329-5336.2000.,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (Antigens, Nuclear)', '0 (Autoantigens)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Co-Repressor Proteins)', '0 (DAXX protein, human)', '0 (Hepatitis Antigens)', '0 (Hepatitis delta Antigens)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Macromolecular Substances)', '0 (Molecular Chaperones)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (RNA, Viral)', '0 (SUMO-1 Protein)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '0 (Ubiquitins)', '0 (hepatitis delta virus large antigen)', '135844-47-2 (Sp100 protein, human)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)']",,PMC110888,,"['CA-1-915/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'GM 57599/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA010815/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AI041136/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R56 AI041136/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'AI 18757/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AI018757/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Comparative studies of envelope incorporation into viral particles and evaluation of the cell binding properties of the targeted vectors revealed critical structural features, thus identifying a subset of optimal TVTMs. Utilizing a modified ELISA to evaluate viral binding to target cells, we observed a significant down-regulation of TVTM-virion binding to human endothelial cells following sustained (48-h) exposure to VEGF. Normalized for equivalent titers (10(6) CFU/ml), as assayed on NIH 3T3 cells, vectors displaying TVTM escort proteins significantly enhanced the transduction efficiency from 12.2 to 37.4% in human KSY-1 endothelial cell cultures (P < 0.001) and from 0.4 to 4.1% in human umbilical vein endothelial cell (HUVEC) cultures (P < 0.001). In summary, these studies utilized an engineering approach to identify a subset of TVTMs that are stably incorporated as envelope ""escort"" proteins into retroviral vectors and that, by functioning to improve the binding efficiency and transduction of both HUVEC and KSY1 endothelial cells, may have therapeutic potential for targeting gene delivery to the tumor-associated vasculature.","['Liu, L', 'Anderson, W F', 'Beart, R W', 'Gordon, E M', 'Hall, F L']","['Liu L', 'Anderson WF', 'Beart RW', 'Gordon EM', 'Hall FL']","['Gene Therapy Laboratories, University of Southern California School of Medicine, Los Angeles, California 90033, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,IM,"['3T3 Cells', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Binding Sites', 'Cell Line, Transformed', 'Endothelial Growth Factors/metabolism', 'Endothelium, Vascular/cytology', 'Fibronectins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Products, env/*genetics', 'Genetic Vectors/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Lymphokines/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/*genetics', 'Neoplasms/metabolism', 'Retroviridae Proteins/*genetics', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factors']",2000/05/09 09:00,2000/07/06 11:00,['2000/05/09 09:00'],"['2000/05/09 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/07/06 11:00 [medline]', '2000/05/09 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/jvi.74.11.5320-5328.2000 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 2000 Jun;74(11):5320-8. doi: 10.1128/jvi.74.11.5320-5328.2000.,"['0 (Endothelial Growth Factors)', '0 (Fibronectins)', '0 (Gene Products, env)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Retroviridae Proteins)', '0 (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A)', '0 (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factors)']",,PMC110887,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Since this selection marker coexisted in trans with the helper virus sequence, helper virus gene expression could be inactivated by host DNA methylation despite selection for the cotransfected selection marker. We have reported that DNA methylation could occur in the long terminal repeat (LTR) region of helper virus in vector producer cells (VPC) in up to 2% of the population per day (W. B. Young, G. L. Lindberg, and C. J. Link, Jr., J. Virol. 74:3177-3187, 2000). To overcome host cell DNA methylation that suppresses viral gene expression, we constructed a chimeric retroviral helper virus, pAM3-IRES-Zeo, that contains Moloney murine leukemia virus as a helper virus and a picornavirus internal ribosome entry site (IRES) sequence followed by a Zeocin selection marker at the 3' end of the env sequence. This pAM3-IRES-Zeo permitted selection for intact and functional helper virus in transfected cells without subcloning. By selection with Zeocin, a mixed population of pAM3-IRES-Zeo-transfected NIH3T3 cells (AMIZ cells) was maintained with little or no DNA methylation of the helper virus 5' LTR. The high level of pAM3-IRES-Zeo gene expression resulted in no detectable vector superinfection and in high vector titers (2 x 10(6) to 1.5 x 10(7) CFU/ml) after introduction of a retroviral vector. When Zeocin selection was withdrawn from AMIZ cells, methylation of the 5' LTR increased from 17 to 36% of the population during 67 days of continuous culture and the cells became susceptible to superinfection. During this period, gene expression of pAM3-IRES-Zeo decreased and vector titer production was reduced to 2 x 10(4) CFU/ml. These data demonstrate an important role of DNA methylation in the genetic instability of VPC. The chimeric helper virus allows the establishment of a mixed population of packaging cells capable of high-level and sustained vector production without cloning procedures.","['Young, W B', 'Link, C J Jr']","['Young WB', 'Link CJ Jr']","['Human Gene Therapy Research Institute, John Stoddard Cancer Center, Des Moines, Iowa 50309, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,IM,"['3T3 Cells', 'Animals', 'Bleomycin', '*DNA Methylation', 'Gene Expression', '*Genetic Vectors', '*Helper Viruses', 'Mice', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus', 'Picornaviridae/*genetics', '*Retroviridae', 'Transfection']",2000/05/09 09:00,2000/07/06 11:00,['2000/05/09 09:00'],"['2000/05/09 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/07/06 11:00 [medline]', '2000/05/09 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/jvi.74.11.5242-5249.2000 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 2000 Jun;74(11):5242-9. doi: 10.1128/jvi.74.11.5242-5249.2000.,"['11056-06-7 (Bleomycin)', '181494-14-4 (Zeocin)']",,PMC110878,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Median age at evaluation was 20 years; median follow up since diagnosis was 15 years at the time of the study. METHODS: Patients and their 134 siblings completed a questionnaire on school career. The percentage of referrals to special primary schools for learning disabled, and the final level of secondary education in patients and siblings were compared, using a six point classification. Within the patient group, the effect of possible risk factors (age at diagnosis, irradiation dose, and gender) was investigated. RESULTS: Significantly more patients than siblings were placed in special educational programmes. A significant difference was found for level of secondary education. No effect of gender or irradiation dose was found, but younger age at diagnosis was significantly related to both referrals and school levels. CONCLUSION: Treatment for childhood ALL with cranial irradiation and chemotherapy at a young age is clearly associated with poorer academic career.","['Kingma, A', 'Rammeloo, L A', 'van Der Does-van den Berg, A', 'Rekers-Mombarg, L', 'Postma, A']","['Kingma A', 'Rammeloo LA', 'van Der Does-van den Berg A', 'Rekers-Mombarg L', 'Postma A']","[""Children's Cancer Center, Department of Pediatrics, University Hospital of Groningen, PO Box 30.001, 9700 RB Groningen, Netherlands.

Relapsing patients respond to donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI) but develop life-threatening complications. METHODS: Patients with CML in first chronic phase received bone marrow (n = 14) or peripheral blood progenitor cell transplants (n = 4) from HLA-identical siblings. GVHD prophylaxis was by ex vivo T-cell depletion with CAMPATH 1G. If disease recurred, donors' mononuclear cells were collected by apheresis, the CD3 samples commencing at 10(6)/kg were aliquoted at half-log increment intervals, cryopreserved, and infused until disease clearance. RESULTS: Eighteen patients (median age: 32.5 years) received transplants. All engrafted without procedure-related mortality. Fourteen patients relapsed, and 13 entered the DLI program. Two developed extensive GVHD after single schedule infusions ranging from 89x10(6) to 670x10(6) mononuclear cells/kg, and one survives in complete remission (CR). The rest, treated with incremental dose DLI, experienced no acute toxicities. One, who had developed grade III steroid-responsive GVHD, died in CR2 from opportunistic infections. Steroids reversed limited cutaneous GVHD and elevated liver enzymes in five patients. Three others developed pancytopenia, and two restored blood counts only after donor peripheral blood progenitor cell infusions. Molecular CR2 was established in 12/13 patients, occurring in 10/11 (91%) on the incremental program at a median accumulation of 67 (range: 5-166) x10(6) CD3 cells/kg. Sixteen of 18 (89%) survive at median of 854.5 days from bone marrow transplantation, 4 in CR1 and 10 in CR2 at a median disease-free survival (for remission 2) duration of 341 days. The median combined disease-free survival of the 14 patients in CR 1+2 is 660 days, with 99% average performance status. CONCLUSIONS: Escalating DLI leads to safe new molecular CR in most CML relapse patients. These results raise the possibility of using ""safe"" transplantation programs of T-cell depletion, that include graded DLI as prevention against disease recurrence.","['Novitzky, N', 'Rubinstein, R', 'Hallett, J M', 'du Toit, C E', 'Thomas, V L']","['Novitzky N', 'Rubinstein R', 'Hallett JM', 'du Toit CE', 'Thomas VL']","['University of Cape Town Leukaemia Centre and the Department of Haematology, Groote Schuur Hospital, Cape, South Africa. novitzky@samiot.uct.ac.za']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Transplantation,Transplantation,0132144,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Bone Marrow Cells/cytology', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease/etiology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', '*Leukapheresis', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/surgery/*therapy', '*Lymphocyte Transfusion/adverse effects', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Pilot Projects', '*Postoperative Care', 'Recurrence', 'Survival Analysis', 'T-Lymphocytes/*cytology', 'Tissue Donors', 'Treatment Outcome']",2000/05/08 09:00,2000/06/08 09:00,['2000/05/08 09:00'],"['2000/05/08 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/06/08 09:00 [medline]', '2000/05/08 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/00007890-200004150-00025 [doi]'],ppublish,Transplantation. 2000 Apr 15;69(7):1358-63. doi: 10.1097/00007890-200004150-00025.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Patients were preconditioned with radiation containing programs. GvHD prophylaxis was by T-cell depletion with CAMPATH 1G (ex vivo; median dose 20 mg). After transplantation lymphoid development was studied by flow cytometry and serum Ig concentrations were determined. Charts were reviewed to determine the effects of the immune reconstitution on the clinical performance. RESULTS: The mean donor mononuclear cell number infused was 0.89x10(8)/kg. Within 6 months all the patients recovered their blood parameters and only one required therapy for GvHD. However, despite normal blood counts, 15 suffered life-threatening opportunistic infections, developing at a median of 24 weeks post grafting, but occurring even after 11 months. At 8 weeks from marrow infusion when leukocyte values had normalized in 15/20, compared to normal, immunophenotyping of blood cells from BMT revealed a significantly reduced mean lymphocyte count (1.06, SD 0.83x10(9)/l; P = 0.01), cells expressing CD3 (0.7x10(9)/l, SD 0.68; P = 0.05), CD4 (0.13x10(9)/l, SD 0.21; P = 0.0001) and CD19 (0.04x10(9)/l, SD 0.05; P = 0.001). Populations expressing CD8 and CD56 remained within normal range throughout the study. Normalization of cell numbers displaying CD2, CD3 and CD19 was delayed until 52, 52 and 24 weeks respectively, while CD4 counts persisted subnormal even at 72 weeks.

This effect was prevented by the pan-caspase inhibitor benzyloxycarbonyl-Val-Ala-Asp-fluoromethyl ketone (Z-VAD-FMK), thereby implicating caspase activity in the process. NOC-18 treatment resulted in the activation of several caspases including caspase-3, -6, -8, and -9(-like) activities and the degradation of several caspase substrates such as nuclear lamins and SP120 (hnRNP-U/SAF-A). Moreover, release of cytochrome c from mitochondria was also observed during NOC-18-induced apoptosis. This change was substantially prevented by Z-VAD-FMK, thereby suggesting that the released cytochrome c might function not only as an initiator but also as an amplifier of the caspase cascade. Bid, a death agonist member of the Bcl-2 family, was processed by caspases following exposure of cells to NOC-18, supporting the above notion.

METHODS: A total of 28 children (age 0-18 years) with AML underwent PBSCT and have had a minimum follow-up of 25 months; including 24 patients in their first complete remission (CR) and four in their second CR. The patients were divided into two cohorts according to the study phase: 16 patients were treated in an early phase pilot study and 12 patients in their first CR were treated in a prospective trial. Fifteen of the first-CR patients had any of the cited high-risk features of high WBC count (>100x10(9)/l; n = 5), FAB M0/M4/M5/M7 subtypes (n = 11) or delayed achievement of CR (n = 9). Except in one patient, cytoreductive regimens did not include total body irradiation (TBI). RESULTS: After PBSCT, one patient died of veno-occulsive disease (VOD) and another patient relapsed early on day 43, but the remaining patients showed engraftment. Leukemic relapse was observed 1-29 months after PBSCT (median, 8 months); in all of the 4 children treated in their second CR and in 11 of the 24 patients (46%) treated in their first CR. The remaining patients have been disease-free for 24 to 97 months (median, 53 months). Using a multivariate analysis, the timing of apheresis was the most significant prognostic factor for those treated in their first CR (p = 0.03); 12 of the 16 patients whose PBSC were collected beyond 2.5 months of CR continue to remain in CR, while seven of the eight patients whose PBSC were harvested within 2.5 months of CR relapsed. CONCLUSION: Although the small number of patients studied does not allow firm conclusions to be drawn regarding the relative effectiveness of this therapy, the results do suggest the feasibility of further studies of PBSCT for the treatment of childhood AML with high-risk features including the assessment of minimum residual disease.","['Horikoshi, Y', 'Mimaya, J', 'Amano, K', 'Kawano, Y', 'Watanabe, A', 'Watanabe, T', 'Sekine, I', 'Nishikawa, K', 'Tsunematsu, Y', 'Endo, M', 'Eguchi, H', 'Koyama, T', 'Kawakami, K', 'Oka, T', 'Matsushita, T', 'Koizumi, S', 'Fujimoto, T', 'Takaue, Y']","['Horikoshi Y', 'Mimaya J', 'Amano K', 'Kawano Y', 'Watanabe A', 'Watanabe T', 'Sekine I', 'Nishikawa K', 'Tsunematsu Y', 'Endo M', 'Eguchi H', 'Koyama T', 'Kawakami K', 'Oka T', 'Matsushita T', 'Koizumi S', 'Fujimoto T', 'Takaue Y']","[""Division of Hematology/Oncology, Shizuoka Children's Hospital, Japan.""]",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Jpn J Clin Oncol,Japanese journal of clinical oncology,0313225,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Female', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/mortality/*therapy', 'Male', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Pilot Projects', 'Prospective Studies', 'Recurrence', 'Survival Rate', 'Transplantation Conditioning', 'Transplantation, Autologous']",2000/05/08 09:00,2000/06/08 09:00,['2000/05/08 09:00'],"['2000/05/08 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/06/08 09:00 [medline]', '2000/05/08 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/jjco/hyd033 [doi]'],ppublish,Jpn J Clin Oncol. 2000 Mar;30(3):137-45. doi: 10.1093/jjco/hyd033.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study was performed to characterize goat PGCs after culture and cryopreservation. Goat PGCs were isolated from Day 32 fetuses and cultured on a continuous cell line of murine embryonal fibroblasts (STO) as feeder-cells in the presence of leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF). The PGCs proliferated slowly and showed colony formation in early passages. Frozen-thawed PGCs continued to proliferate when stem cell factor (SCF) was added to the culture medium. However, differentiation into epithelial-like polygonal cells or neuronal cells was observed after 1 or 2 passages. The PGCs of 1 female and 1 male cell line were characterized by immunocytochemistry. The PGCs showed positive staining for anti stage-specific embryonic antigen-1 (SSEA-1) and FMA-1 (monoclonal antibody produced against a glycoprotein cell surface antigen of the embryonal carcinoma Nulli SCC1), whereas the reactivity to alkaline phosphatase (AP), an established marker for PGCs in mice, was inconsistent. After differentiation, PGCs lost their positive reaction to SSEA-1, EMA-1 and AP. In conclusion, SSEA-1 and EMA-1 can be used as reliable markers for identifying goat PGCs in addition to morphological criteria. The results indicate that goat PGCs can be kept in long-term culture without losing their morphological characteristics and their positive reaction to SSEA-1 and EMA-1, thus providing a promising source of donor-karyoplasts for nuclear transfer procedures.","['Kuhholzer, B', 'Baguisi, A', 'Overstrom, E W']","['Kuhholzer B', 'Baguisi A', 'Overstrom EW']","['Department of Biomedical Sciences, Tufts University, School of Veterinary Medicine, North Grafton, MA 01536, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Theriogenology,Theriogenology,0421510,IM,"['Alkaline Phosphatase/analysis', 'Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/analysis', '*Calcium-Transporting ATPases', 'Cell Culture Techniques/methods/*veterinary', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cryopreservation/veterinary', 'Female', 'Germ Cells/*cytology/growth & development', 'Goats/embryology/*growth & development', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Karyotyping', 'Lewis X Antigen/analysis', 'Male', 'Molecular Chaperones/immunology', '*Saccharomyces cerevisiae Proteins', 'Vimentin/analysis']",2000/05/08 09:00,2000/07/08 11:00,['2000/05/08 09:00'],"['2000/05/08 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/07/08 11:00 [medline]', '2000/05/08 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0093-691X(00)00253-3 [pii]', '10.1016/S0093-691X(00)00253-3 [doi]']",ppublish,Theriogenology. 2000 Mar 15;53(5):1071-9. doi: 10.1016/S0093-691X(00)00253-3.,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Lewis X Antigen)', '0 (Molecular Chaperones)', '0 (SSC1 protein, S cerevisiae)', '0 (Saccharomyces cerevisiae Proteins)', '0 (Vimentin)', 'EC 3.1.3.1 (Alkaline Phosphatase)', 'EC 7.2.2.10 (Calcium-Transporting ATPases)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Pathol. 1997: 25: 256-263] noticed that there is a negative correlation (anticorrelation) between development of liver tumors and leukemia or lymphomas. If an animal has a lymphoma or leukemia it is less likely to develop liver tumors. These studies noted that this applies to several strains of animals. The anticorrelation appeared in control animals. In this paper we study this anticorrelation in the quarter of a million rodents exposed in the Carcinogenesis Bioassay Database System (CBDS) database of the National Toxicology program in both control and dosed animals. We failed to completely replicate Young and Gries or Haseman et al. However, when benign liver tumors (adenomas or nodules) and malignant liver tumors (carcinomas) are considered separately AND different leukemia and lymphoma types are considered, a strong anticorrelation appears. We identify survival and the time period (in years) during which the bioassay was completed as an important factor in interpreting correlations and anticorrelations. Differences between liver adenomas and carcinomas and lymphoma types contribute to a more general question of grouping of the individual tumor types. In our classification scheme (originally developed about 1986 by Dr. Bailar) an effort is made to distinguish benign and malignant neoplasms, while other investigators group all tumors at a specific site. For many analyses liver adenomas and carcinomas have been lumped together. This is because it is suspected that the diagnoses by pathologists may not distinguish, or ignore the (benign) adenoma when a (malignant) carcinoma is present. Possible biological differences in tumor mechanisms may require separate evaluation of these tumors with all the dangers of ""pathologist bias"" that this introduces.","['Linkov, I', 'Polkanov, M', 'Shagiakhmetov, A', 'Wilson, R', 'Gray, G M']","['Linkov I', 'Polkanov M', 'Shagiakhmetov A', 'Wilson R', 'Gray GM']","['Harvard Center for Risk Analysis, Harvard School of Public Health, Boston, Massachusetts 02115, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Toxicol Ind Health,Toxicology and industrial health,8602702,IM,"['Adenoma/*chemically induced/pathology', 'Animals', 'Carcinogenicity Tests/statistics & numerical data', 'Carcinogens/toxicity', 'Carcinoma/*chemically induced/pathology', 'Female', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*chemically induced/pathology', 'Liver Neoplasms, Experimental/*chemically induced/pathology', 'Lymphoma/*chemically induced/pathology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Rats']",2000/05/08 09:00,2000/07/06 11:00,['2000/05/08 09:00'],"['2000/05/08 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/07/06 11:00 [medline]', '2000/05/08 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1177/074823370001600103 [doi]'],ppublish,Toxicol Ind Health. 2000 Jan;16(1):16-40. doi: 10.1177/074823370001600103.,['0 (Carcinogens)'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although exposure to both 60 Hz electric and magnetic fields can be characterized in many ways, to date, risk assessment has been performed by using only a limited number of exposure indices. METHODS: The associations between adult leukemia and indices of electric and magnetic fields were explored within a nested case-control study of 31,453 Ontario electric utility workers. RESULTS: The percentage of time spent above electric field thresholds of 20 and 39 V/m was predictive of leukemia risk after adjusting for duration of employment and the arithmetic mean exposure to both electric and magnetic fields (P<0.05). Duration of employment was strongly associated with an increased risk of leukemia. Those who had worked for at least 20 years, and were in the highest tertiles of percentage of time spent above 10 and 20 V/m had odds ratios of 10.17 (95% CI = 1.58-65.30) and 8.23 (95% CI = 1. 24-54.43), respectively, when compared to those in the lowest tertile.

Translocation-dependent activation of oncogenes, transcription factors or developmental genes can trigger the development of neoplasia in a lineage-specific fashion. These events are not sufficient for tumorigenesis, however, since some of the most prominent tumor-associated translocations, such as Ig/myc and Ig/bcl-2, have been detected in normal individuals who did not develop tumors. Tumor development must, therefore, require subsequent genetic changes. Among them, the increased expression of genes that protect against apoptosis or, alternatively, mutations that cripple apoptosis-activating genes play a prominent role. Some of the translocations associated with T-cell leukemia, myeloid leukemia, and a variety of sarcomas act by generating fusion proteins. The participating genes encode transcription factors and/or developmental regulators. Fusion protein-expressing cells may serve as targets for specific interference with abnormal signaling pathways or for targeted immune attack. Using PCR to detect cells carrying such translocations is useful for tumor diagnosis, prognosis, and choice of therapy.","['Klein, G']",['Klein G'],"['Microbiology and Tumor Biology Center, Karolinska Institute, S 171 77 Stockholm, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Bioessays,"BioEssays : news and reviews in molecular, cellular and developmental biology",8510851,IM,"['Abelson murine leukemia virus/physiology', 'Animals', 'B-Lymphocytes/*cytology', 'Carcinogenicity Tests', 'Cell Division', '*Gene Rearrangement', 'Herpesvirus 4, Human/physiology', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulins/*genetics', '*Oncogenes', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/genetics', 'T-Lymphocytes/*cytology', '*Translocation, Genetic']",2000/05/08 09:00,2000/07/08 11:00,['2000/05/08 09:00'],"['2000/05/08 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/07/08 11:00 [medline]', '2000/05/08 09:00 [entrez]']","['10.1002/(SICI)1521-1878(200005)22:5<414::AID-BIES3>3.0.CO;2-5 [pii]', '10.1002/(SICI)1521-1878(200005)22:5<414::AID-BIES3>3.0.CO;2-5 [doi]']",ppublish,Bioessays. 2000 May;22(5):414-22. doi: 10.1002/(SICI)1521-1878(200005)22:5<414::AID-BIES3>3.0.CO;2-5.,"['0 (Immunoglobulins)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)']",39,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To study these, we have developed flow cytometry assays of checkpoint function that also allow quantitation of key molecular regulators of apoptosis and cell cycle. We have used three-color (3C) assays, with FITC-labeled anti-BCL-2 and PE-labeled anti-proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) antibodies, and the DNA dye 7-aminoactinomycin, to characterize primary leukemia cells identified in DNA x side light scatter (SSC) histograms. We showed that 3C assays are accurate and reproducible in analyses of leukemia cell lines and of primary AML and normal bone marrow samples (Banker et al.: Blood 89: 243-255, 1997; Banker et al.: Leukemia Res 22: 221-239, 1998; Banker et al.: Clin Cancer Res 4: 3051-3062, 1998). To further confirm the validity of our SSC leukemia cell gating and to address whether immunophenotypic AML subsets might have different biologic properties, we have now designed four-color (4C) flow assays to characterize checkpoint status in leukemic blasts specifically identified by surface immunostaining. In modeling this assay strategy, PE/Cy5-labeled anti-CD34 antibody was used to detect blasts, with FITC-labeled anti-BCL-2, PE-labeled anti-PCNA antibodies, and Hoechst 33342 (H33342) DNA dye. Four-color CD34-gated data was concordant with 3C, SSC-gated data for leukemia cell lines and for most primary AML samples with high and intermediate blast counts. BCL-2 and PCNA immunopositivity and sub-G1 apoptosis determinations were different in the CD34-gated versus SSC-gated blasts in particular samples with smaller CD34(+) subsets, suggesting that leukemia samples can contain blast subsets with different biologic properties. On the other hand, PCNA-gated cell-cycle distributions in untreated cells and G1 versus S phase cell-cycle arrests after cytosine arabinoside treatments were completely concordant in 4C and 3C assays. We conclude that both 3C and 4C assays can be used to characterize protein expression and cell-cycle drug response patterns in leukemia blasts, but that 4C assays may additionally allow discrimination of these properties in immunophenotypic leukemia subsets.","['Garrido, S M', 'Willman, C', 'Appelbaum, F R', 'Banker, D E']","['Garrido SM', 'Willman C', 'Appelbaum FR', 'Banker DE']","['Division of Hematology, University of Washington, School of Medicine, Seattle, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cytometry,Cytometry,8102328,IM,"['Antibodies', 'Antigens, CD34/analysis/immunology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Color', 'Dactinomycin/analogs & derivatives', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Flow Cytometry/*methods', 'Fluorescein-5-isothiocyanate', 'Fluorescent Dyes', 'G1 Phase/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'K562 Cells/chemistry/cytology/drug effects', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*diagnosis/*drug therapy/immunology', 'Proliferating Cell Nuclear Antigen/analysis/immunology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/analysis/immunology', 'S Phase/drug effects']",2000/05/08 09:00,2000/08/19 11:00,['2000/05/08 09:00'],"['2000/05/08 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/08/19 11:00 [medline]', '2000/05/08 09:00 [entrez]']","['10.1002/(SICI)1097-0320(20000415)42:2<83::AID-CYTO1>3.0.CO;2-G [pii]', '10.1002/(sici)1097-0320(20000415)42:2<83::aid-cyto1>3.0.co;2-g [doi]']",ppublish,Cytometry. 2000 Apr 15;42(2):83-94. doi: 10.1002/(sici)1097-0320(20000415)42:2<83::aid-cyto1>3.0.co;2-g.,"['0 (Antibodies)', '0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Fluorescent Dyes)', '0 (Proliferating Cell Nuclear Antigen)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '1CC1JFE158 (Dactinomycin)', '7240-37-1 (7-aminoactinomycin D)', 'I223NX31W9 (Fluorescein-5-isothiocyanate)']",,,"['Copyright 2000 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']","['CA18029/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA18105/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA32102/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study was performed to determine the extent of and factors associated with early death in childhood cancer. PROCEDURE: Patients with of primary cancer, aged <20 years at diagnosis, were identified from the SEER data (n = 23,470) from 1973 to 1995. Early deaths were defined as cases identified by 1) death certificate, 2) autopsy report, or 3) death within 1 month of initial diagnoses (n = 481). Cause of death was determined by ICD-8 and -9 codes. Age at diagnosis, year of diagnosis, morphology, site of disease, race, and gender were evaluated for association with early death. RESULTS: Age <1 year at diagnosis (6.2% early deaths), being diagnosed earlier in the observation period, and a diagnosis of a brain tumor, neuroblastoma, leukemia, or liver tumor were associated with increased early death. Gender and race were not associated with early death. Among the cases for whom the malignant diagnosis was made at the time of death (n = 119), the cause of death was nonmalignant for 36. For 22 of these cases the malignancy was an incidental finding and appeared not to contribute directly to the cause of death. Among these patients, 11 had neuroblastoma, 9 being <1 year of age. CONCLUSIONS: A decrease in the proportion of early deaths associated with childhood cancer has occurred during the past 2 decades. This decrease may reflect earlier diagnosis or improved imaging capabilities, surgical techniques, medical therapy, and supportive care. Awareness among pediatricians, general practitioners, and emergency physicians is warranted, with a focus on high-risk groups for early detection among childhood cancer patients.","['Hamre, M R', 'Williams, J', 'Chuba, P', 'Bhambhani, K', 'Ravindranath, Y', 'Severson, R K']","['Hamre MR', 'Williams J', 'Chuba P', 'Bhambhani K', 'Ravindranath Y', 'Severson RK']","['Department of Pediatrics, Barbara Karmanos Cancer Institute, Wayne State University, Detroit, MI, USA. mhamre@med.wayne.edu']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Med Pediatr Oncol,Medical and pediatric oncology,7506654,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Autopsy', 'Brain Neoplasms/mortality', 'Cause of Death', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Death Certificates', 'Diagnostic Imaging', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia/mortality', 'Liver Neoplasms/mortality', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/diagnosis/*mortality/surgery', 'Neuroblastoma/mortality', 'Racial Groups', 'SEER Program', 'Sex Factors', 'Survival Rate', 'United States/epidemiology']",2000/05/08 09:00,2000/06/08 09:00,['2000/05/08 09:00'],"['2000/05/08 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/06/08 09:00 [medline]', '2000/05/08 09:00 [entrez]']","['10.1002/(SICI)1096-911X(200005)34:5<343::AID-MPO5>3.0.CO;2-B [pii]', '10.1002/(sici)1096-911x(200005)34:5<343::aid-mpo5>3.0.co;2-b [doi]']",ppublish,Med Pediatr Oncol. 2000 May;34(5):343-7. doi: 10.1002/(sici)1096-911x(200005)34:5<343::aid-mpo5>3.0.co;2-b.,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],,,"['Copyright 2000 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PROCEDURE: All children with HR-ALL in Finland during 1990-1996 were included. Two open-label study groups were formed: 1) 34 children diagnosed between January, 1992, and December, 1996, received seven or nine courses (depending on cranial RT or no cranial RT) of GM-CSF at 5 microg/kg s.c. daily until an absolute neutrophil count (ANC) of 1,000 x 10(6)/liter at scheduled places in the protocol and 2) 80 control children, those diagnosed between January, 1990, and December, 1991, plus all with significant coexpression of myeloid markers, did not receive GM-CSF. RESULTS: Dose intensity increased in patients who received regular GM-CSF support. The intensive phase of therapy, including induction, consolidation courses, and delayed intensification, was 33 days shorter (P < 0.001) in children with seven courses and 26 days shorter (P < 0.01) in those with nine courses of GM-CSF compared to controls. The number of infections during the whole ALL therapy was reduced by use of GM-CSF in children aged >5 years (P < 0.001), but not in those aged <5 years. The mean total duration of intravenous antibiotics per child was 39 days in the GM-CSF group and 48 days in the control group (P < 0. 001). Systematic use of GM-CSF was cost-effective. CONCLUSIONS: Systematic use of GM-CSF improved dose intensity by shortening the intensive treatment period by about 4 weeks. Use of GM-CSF reduced the days for inpatient antibiotics by about 1 week per child, which translates into reduced costs.","['Saarinen-Pihkala, U M', 'Lanning, M', 'Perkkio, M', 'Makipernaa, A', 'Salmi, T T', 'Hovi, L', 'Vettenranta, K']","['Saarinen-Pihkala UM', 'Lanning M', 'Perkkio M', 'Makipernaa A', 'Salmi TT', 'Hovi L', 'Vettenranta K']","['Hospital for Children and Adolescents, University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Med Pediatr Oncol,Medical and pediatric oncology,7506654,IM,"['Age Factors', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents/administration & dosage/economics/therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/administration & dosage/*adverse effects', 'Bacterial Infections/prevention & control', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cohort Studies', 'Cost-Benefit Analysis', 'Cranial Irradiation', 'Female', 'Fever/*prevention & control', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/administration & dosage/economics/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Injections, Intravenous', 'Length of Stay/economics', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Linear Models', 'Male', 'Neutropenia/*prevention & control', 'Neutrophils/pathology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/radiotherapy', 'Risk Factors', 'Time Factors', 'Treatment Outcome']",2000/05/08 09:00,2000/06/08 09:00,['2000/05/08 09:00'],"['2000/05/08 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/06/08 09:00 [medline]', '2000/05/08 09:00 [entrez]']","['10.1002/(SICI)1096-911X(200005)34:5<319::AID-MPO2>3.0.CO;2-5 [pii]', '10.1002/(sici)1096-911x(200005)34:5<319::aid-mpo2>3.0.co;2-5 [doi]']",ppublish,Med Pediatr Oncol. 2000 May;34(5):319-27. doi: 10.1002/(sici)1096-911x(200005)34:5<319::aid-mpo2>3.0.co;2-5.,"['0 (Anti-Bacterial Agents)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",,,"['Copyright 2000 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The majority of these patients do not survive. This limited institution study sought to improve event-free survival (EFS) by intensification of chemotherapy. PROCEDURE: Twenty-one patients with either an isolated marrow (n = 16) or a combined marrow and central nervous system relapse (n = 5) received treatment according to Children's Hospital of Philadelphia protocol CHP-540. Six patients had an initial remission of <36 months, and five patients had relapsed within 1 year of completion of phase III therapy. Induction and reinduction therapy consisted of idarubicin, vincristine, dexamethasone, asparaginase, and triple intrathecal chemotherapy. Consolidation and reconsolidation therapy employed high-dose cytarabine, etoposide, and asparaginase given in a sequential manner. Maintenance therapy included courses of high- or low-dose cytarabine followed by sequential etoposide and asparaginase pulse, moderate-dose methotrexate with delayed leukovorin rescue, and vincristine/dexamethasone pulses. Therapy continued for 2 years from the start of interim maintenance in the 16 patients who did not receive a bone marrow transplant (BMT). Two patients underwent an HLA-identical sibling BMT specified by protocol. Four received a nonprotocol-prescribed alternative donor BMT. RESULTS: The complete remission induction rate was 95%. With a median follow-up from date of relapse of 49 months in survivors, the actuarial EFS based on intent to treat is 75%. There were three toxic deaths in patients in CR and two deaths from relapse.

Expression levels of the respective fusion RNAs reflect disease progression as well as remission upon therapeutic intervention in CML patients. However, there is no quick and reliable method that would allow the quantitative routine monitoring of bcr/abl hybrid transcripts. A fluorescent probe-based PCR assay (TaqMan) has been described to quantitfy the exact amount of target sequences. We have established TaqMan real-time RT-PCRs for M-bcr/abl (b2a2, b2a3, b3a2, b3a3) and m-bcr/abl (e1a2) fusion transcripts as well as for beta-actin. All PCRs quantified as little as 10 copies/100 ng total cDNA. In order to investigate whether this procedure is appropriate for routine diagnostic monitoring, we performed retrospective measurements on 9 documented CML disease courses. Our data show that ongoing or relapsing CML is paralleled by increasing peripheral levels of bcr/abl fusion RNAs. Furthermore, sucessful anti-leukemic treatment is reflected by decreasing absolute bcr/abl transcript numbers. In contrast with conventional bcr/abl PCR techniques we could distinguish single positive values and gradually increasing copy numbers.","['Kreuzer, K A', 'Lass, U', 'Nagel, S', 'Ellerbrok, H', 'Pauli, G', 'Pawlaczyk-Peter, B', 'Siegert, W', 'Huhn, D', 'Schmidt, C A']","['Kreuzer KA', 'Lass U', 'Nagel S', 'Ellerbrok H', 'Pauli G', 'Pawlaczyk-Peter B', 'Siegert W', 'Huhn D', 'Schmidt CA']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Division of Hematology and Oncology, Charite-Virchow-Clinic, Humboldt University, Berlin, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,IM,"['Disease Progression', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/genetics/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/genetics/*metabolism', 'Quality Control', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'Reference Standards', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction/*methods']",2000/05/08 09:00,2000/06/10 09:00,['2000/05/08 09:00'],"['2000/05/08 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/06/10 09:00 [medline]', '2000/05/08 09:00 [entrez]']","['10.1002/(SICI)1097-0215(20000601)86:5<741::AID-IJC22>3.0.CO;2-1 [pii]', '10.1002/(sici)1097-0215(20000601)86:5<741::aid-ijc22>3.0.co;2-1 [doi]']",ppublish,Int J Cancer. 2000 Jun 1;86(5):741-6. doi: 10.1002/(sici)1097-0215(20000601)86:5<741::aid-ijc22>3.0.co;2-1.,"['0 (RNA, Messenger)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",,,"['Copyright 2000 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

OBJECTIVES: To study whether nystatin decreases morbidity and mortality when given prophylactically or therapeutically to patients with severe immunodeficiency. SEARCH STRATEGY: MEDLINE and The Cochrane Library using a comprehensive search strategy. Contacted industry and scanned reference lists. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised trials comparing nystatin with placebo, an untreated control group, fluconazole or amphotericin B. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Data on mortality, invasive fungal infection and colonisation were extracted by both authors independently. The outcomes were weighted by the inverse variance. A random effects model was used unless p>0.10 for the test of heterogeneity. MAIN RESULTS: We included 10 trials (1, 122 patients). The drugs were given prophylactically in eight trials and as treatment in two. Six trials were in acute leukaemia, one mainly in cancer, one in liver transplant patients, one in critically ill surgical and trauma patients, and one in AIDS patients. Nystatin had been compared with placebo in three trials and with fluconazole in seven; the dose varied from 1.5 MIE to 72 MIE daily. The effect of nystatin was similar to that of placebo on fungal colonisation (relative risk 0.85, 95% confidence interval 0. 65 to 1.13). There was no difference between fluconazole and nystatin on mortality (relative risk 0.87, 0.52 to 1.44) whereas fluconazole was more effective in preventing invasive fungal infection (relative risk 0.42, 0.16 to 1.12) and colonisation (relative risk 0.50, 0.36 to 0.71).

This review focuses specifically on intercessory prayer, which is organised, regular and committed, and those who practise it will almost inevitably hold some committed belief that they are praying to God. Whilst the outcomes of trials of prayer cannot be interpreted as 'proof/disproof' of God's response to those praying, there may be an effect of prayer not dependent on divine intervention. This may be quantifiable, making this investigation of a most widely used health care intervention both possible and important. OBJECTIVES: To review the effectiveness of prayer as an additional intervention for those with health problems already receiving standard medical care. SEARCH STRATEGY: ATLA (1949-1997), Biological Abstracts (1985-1999), CINAHL (1982-1999), The Cochrane Schizophrenia Group's Register (December 1999), CCTR of the Cochrane Library (Issue 4, 1999), EMBASE (1980-1999), MEDLINE (1966-1999) and PsycLIT (1887-1999), Sociofile (1974-1996) and Sociological Abstracts (1963-1999) were methodically searched. All references of articles selected were searched for further relevant trials. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised trials of personal, focused, committed and organised intercessory prayer on behalf of anyone with a health problem were considered. Outcomes such as achievement of desired goals, death, illness, quality of life and well-being for the recipients of prayer, those praying and the care-givers were sought. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Studies were reliably selected and assessed for methodological quality. Data were extracted by two reviewers working independently. Dichotomous data were analysed on an intention-to-treat basis. MAIN RESULTS: There was no evidence that prayer affected the numbers of people dying from leukaemia or heart disease (OR 1.11, CI 0.79-1.56, n=1424). Intercessory prayer did not clearly decrease the odds of people with heart problems experiencing a bad or intermediate outcome (OR 0.8, CI 0.64-1.00, n=1444) but this finding was moved towards the null by inclusion of a negative assumption for those who were dropped from the analysis in one study. Prayer increased the odds of readmission to the Coronary Care Unit (OR 1.54 CI 1.02-2.33, n=1406) but these results are made significantly negative by the inclusion of an assumption of poor outcome for those not accounted for in the final analyses. REVIEWER'S CONCLUSIONS: Data in this review are too inconclusive to guide those wishing to uphold or refute the effect of intercessory prayer on health care outcomes. In the light of the best available data, there are no grounds to change current practices. There are few completed trials of the value of intercessory prayer, and the evidence presented so far is interesting enough to justify further study. If prayer is seen as a human endeavour it may or may not be beneficial, and further trials could uncover this. It could be the case that any effects are due to elements beyond present scientific understanding that will, in time, be understood. If any benefit derives from God's response to prayer it may be beyond any such trials to prove or disprove.","['Roberts, L', 'Ahmed, I', 'Hall, S']","['Roberts L', 'Ahmed I', 'Hall S']","['Westcott House, Jesus Lane, Cambridge, UK, CB5 8BP. lr226@cam.ac.uk']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review', 'Systematic Review']",England,Cochrane Database Syst Rev,The Cochrane database of systematic reviews,100909747,IM,"['Humans', '*Mental Healing', '*Religion and Medicine']",2000/05/05 09:00,2000/07/08 11:00,['2000/05/05 09:00'],"['2000/05/05 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/07/08 11:00 [medline]', '2000/05/05 09:00 [entrez]']","['CD000368 [pii]', '10.1002/14651858.CD000368 [doi]']",ppublish,Cochrane Database Syst Rev. 2000;(2):CD000368. doi: 10.1002/14651858.CD000368.,,4,,,,,,,,,,['Cochrane Database Syst Rev. 2007;(1):CD000368.

We have previously reported alternative splicing of BCR/ABL, as indicated by the detection of both p190- and p210-encoding transcripts, in about 60% of CML patient samples. These exon-skipping events involved the joining of ABL exon 2 to variable upstream BCR exons. Similarly, ABL exon 2 is alternatively spliced to either of two upstream ABL exons (1a or 1b) in c-ABL. We have constructed BCR and BCR/ABL minigenes to study this phenomenon in more detail. These constructs were transfected into various cell types and splicing was assessed by reverse transcriptase PCR. Whereas the basic BCR minigene expressed exon-inclusive transcripts only, insertion of genomic DNA spanning ABL exon 2 induced exon-skipping but only when expressed in the CML cell lines K562 and EM3. In this study we localized the required sequence element to ABL exon 2 itself. These results mimic the splicing phenotype displayed by most CML patients. We propose a model where a trans-factor present in some CML cells interacts with ABL exon 2 pre-mRNA to promote skipping of upstream BCR exons.","['Lichty, B D', 'Kamel-Reid, S']","['Lichty BD', 'Kamel-Reid S']","['Department of Laboratory Medicine and Pathobiology, University of Toronto, Ontario, Canada.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Biochem J,The Biochemical journal,2984726R,IM,"['Alleles', 'Alternative Splicing', 'Exons/genetics', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*genetics', 'Oncogene Proteins/*genetics', '*Protein-Tyrosine Kinases', '*Proto-Oncogene Proteins', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-abl/*genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcr', 'RNA Precursors/genetics', 'Translocation, Genetic', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2000/05/05 09:00,2000/07/25 11:00,['2000/05/05 09:00'],"['2000/05/05 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/07/25 11:00 [medline]', '2000/05/05 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Biochem J. 2000 May 15;348 Pt 1:63-9.,"['0 (Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (RNA Precursors)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-abl)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (BCR protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcr)']",,PMC1221036,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We find, however, that the suspension-grown cell lines U937, L1210, and MOLT-4 contain exclusively hyperphosphorylated Rb. Furthermore, when adherent NIH3T3 cells are grown at very low densities to avoid overgrowth and contact inhibition, they also contain only hyperphosphorylated Rb. NIH3T3 cells exhibit hypophosphorylation when the cells are grown at moderate to high cell densities. We propose that cultures of adherent cells such as NIH3T3, when grown to moderate cell densities, are made up of two populations of cells: (a) cells that are relatively isolated and therefore growing exponentially without contact inhibition, and (b) cells that are growth-inhibited by local cell density or contact inhibition. The common observation in adherent cell lines, that Rb is both hyper- and hypophosphorylated in the G1-phase and only hyperphosphorylated in the S- and G2-phases, is explained by the effects of cell density and contact inhibition. Thus, phosphorylation-dephosphorylation of Rb protein during the G1 phase is not a necessary process during the NIH3T3, L1210, MOLT-4, and U937 division cycles. We propose that phosphorylation-dephosphorylation of Rb is independent of the division cycle and is primarily determined by growth conditions throughout the division cycle.","['Cooper, S', 'Yu, C', 'Shayman, J A']","['Cooper S', 'Yu C', 'Shayman JA']","['Department of Microbiology and Immunology, University of Michigan Medical School, Ann Arbor 48109-0620, USA. cooper@umich.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,IUBMB Life,IUBMB life,100888706,IM,"['3T3 Cells', 'Animals', 'Cell Count', 'Cell Cycle/*physiology', 'Cell Line', 'G1 Phase/physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia L1210/metabolism/pathology', 'Mice', 'Phosphorylation', 'Retinoblastoma Protein/*metabolism', 'U937 Cells']",2000/05/04 09:00,2000/06/08 09:00,['2000/05/04 09:00'],"['2000/05/04 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/06/08 09:00 [medline]', '2000/05/04 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/713803488 [doi]'],ppublish,IUBMB Life. 1999 Aug;48(2):225-30. doi: 10.1080/713803488.,['0 (Retinoblastoma Protein)'],,,,"['DK39255/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'DK41487/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Pairs of differently colored cosmids were detected on paraformaldehyde-fixed HL60 nuclei, and their relative positions, internal or peripheral, in individual nuclei were scored. Our results suggest that the intranuclear arrangement of human chromosome 12 is not random. Some chromosomal domains, including the centromere, were located in the periphery of the nucleus, while other domains, including the telomeres, were positioned in the internal areas of the nucleus in GO(G1) cells. Based on the replication banding patterns of metaphase spreads, human chromosome 12 was divided roughly into five large domains. Interestingly, the clones in late replicating domains were preferentially localized in the nuclear periphery, whereas clones in early replicating domains were arranged in the internal areas of the nuclei. The DNA replication timing of each cosmid determined by FISH-based assay did not reflect the replication bands, but an overall profile of the replication timing was relatively correlated with these domains on chromosome 12.

However, central nervous system (CNS) relapses frequently occur in patients with ALL who continuously receive anticancer drugs, including 6-MP, during remission maintenance therapy. The cause of such CNS relapse is not well understood. One possible reason may involve the restricted distribution of 6-MP in the brain. This study, therefore, investigates the blood-brain barrier (BBB) transport which largely regulates 6-MP distribution in the brain using a quantitative microdialysis technique and centers on the efflux transport of 6-MP across the BBB. The brain tissue, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), or hippocampal interstitial fluid (ISF) concentration of 6-MP was very low compared with the unbound plasma concentration, suggesting that 6-MP distribution in the brain is highly restricted. Kinetic analyses of this BBB transport showed that the efflux clearance from brain ISF to plasma across the BBB (CLout) is approximately 20-times greater than the influx clearance from plasma to brain (CLin). The CLout was significantly reduced by 1mM N-ethylmaleimide (NEM), a sulfhydryl-modifying agent, suggesting the participation of transport protein in the efflux of 6-MP across the BBB. In addition, efflux transport was inhibited by an intracerebral infusion of probenecid (1.5 mM), p-aminohippuric acid (PAH, 3.0 mM), benzoate (3.6 mM), or salicylate (3.7 mM) administered through a microdialysis probe, but neither choline (0.8 mM) nor tetraethylammonium (TEA, 0.7 mM) had any effect. These data suggest that the restricted 6-MP brain distribution may be ascribed to efficient efflux from the brain, possibly via both the organic anion transport system, shared with probenecid and PAH, and the monocarboxylic acid transport system, shared with benzoate and salicylate.","['Deguchi, Y', 'Yokoyama, Y', 'Sakamoto, T', 'Hayashi, H', 'Naito, T', 'Yamada, S', 'Kimura, R']","['Deguchi Y', 'Yokoyama Y', 'Sakamoto T', 'Hayashi H', 'Naito T', 'Yamada S', 'Kimura R']","['Department of Biopharmacy, School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Shizuoka, Japan. deguchi@ys7.u-shizuoka-ken.ac.jp']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Life Sci,Life sciences,0375521,IM,"['Animals', 'Blood Proteins/metabolism', '*Blood-Brain Barrier', 'Brain/*metabolism', 'Ethylmaleimide/pharmacology', 'Male', 'Mercaptopurine/*pharmacokinetics', 'Metabolic Clearance Rate', 'Microdialysis', 'Probenecid/pharmacology', 'Protein Binding', 'Rats', 'Rats, Wistar']",2000/05/04 09:00,2000/05/16 09:00,['2000/05/04 09:00'],"['2000/05/04 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/05/16 09:00 [medline]', '2000/05/04 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0024320599006372 [pii]', '10.1016/s0024-3205(99)00637-2 [doi]']",ppublish,Life Sci. 2000;66(7):649-62. doi: 10.1016/s0024-3205(99)00637-2.,"['0 (Blood Proteins)', 'E7WED276I5 (Mercaptopurine)', 'O3C74ACM9V (Ethylmaleimide)', 'PO572Z7917 (Probenecid)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

For rapid backbone motions (on a time scale of 10 ps to 100 ns), as probed by 15N relaxation measurements, the dynamics parameters were calculated using the model-free formalism incorporating the model selection approach. The principal components of the inertia tensor of MH35-LIF, as calculated from its NMR structure, were 1:0.98:0.38. The global rotational motion of the molecule was, therefore, assumed to be axially symmetric in the analysis of its relaxation data. This yielded a diffusion anisotropy D(parallel)/D(perpendicular) of 1.31 and an effective correlation time (4D(perpendicular) + 2D(parallel))(-1) of 8.9 ns. The average values of the order parameters (S2) for the four helices, the long interhelical loops, and the N-terminus were 0.91, 0.84, and 0.65, respectively, indicating that LIF is fairly rigid in solution, except at the N-terminus. The S2 values for the long interhelical loops of MH35-LIF were higher than those of their counterparts in short-chain members of the four-helical bundle cytokine family. Residues involved in LIF receptor binding showed no consistent pattern of backbone mobilities, with S2 values ranging from 0.71 to 0.95, but residues contributing to receptor binding site III had relatively lower S2 values, implying higher amplitude motions than for the backbone of sites I and II. In the relatively slow motion regime, backbone amide exchange measurements showed that a number of amides from the helical bundle exchanged extremely slowly, persisting for several months in 2H2O at 37 degrees C. Evidence for local unfolding was considered, and correlations among various structure-related parameters and the backbone amide exchange rates were examined. Both sets of data concur in showing that LIF is one of the most rigid four-helical bundle cytokines.","['Yao, S', 'Smith, D K', 'Hinds, M G', 'Zhang, J G', 'Nicola, N A', 'Norton, R S']","['Yao S', 'Smith DK', 'Hinds MG', 'Zhang JG', 'Nicola NA', 'Norton RS']","['Biomolecular Research Institute, Parkville, Australia.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Protein Sci,Protein science : a publication of the Protein Society,9211750,IM,"['Amides/chemistry', 'Binding Sites', 'Growth Inhibitors/*chemistry', '*Interleukin-6', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Lymphokines/*chemistry', 'Nitrogen Isotopes', 'Protein Conformation']",2000/05/04 09:00,2000/06/17 09:00,['2000/05/04 09:00'],"['2000/05/04 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/06/17 09:00 [medline]', '2000/05/04 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1110/ps.9.4.671 [doi]'],ppublish,Protein Sci. 2000 Apr;9(4):671-82. doi: 10.1110/ps.9.4.671.,"['0 (Amides)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Nitrogen Isotopes)']",,PMC2144613,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: A 61-year-old male presented with a large tumour of the left orbit. Exenteration was performed with subsequent histological analysis of the excised mass. RESULTS: The main tumour showed the characteristic features of a keratoacanthoma. However, the posterior aspect of the tumour disclosed the morphology of a squamous cell carcinoma. Six months later, the patient presented with metastases to lymph nodes, lung and mediastinal tissue. A leukemoid reaction was diagnosed by fine needle biopsy. CONCLUSION: The giant variety of keratoacanthoma may fail to regress and can transform into a squamous cell carcinoma. In our patient, the development of a chronic lymphoid leukemia raises the possibility that it may be the underlying cause for the transformation of the posterior part of the keratoacanthoma into a frank squamous cell carcinoma.","['Alyahya, G A', 'Heegaard, S', 'Prause, J U']","['Alyahya GA', 'Heegaard S', 'Prause JU']","['Eye Pathology Institute, University of Copenhagen, Denmark.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Denmark,Acta Ophthalmol Scand,Acta ophthalmologica Scandinavica,9507578,IM,"['Carcinoma, Squamous Cell/*pathology/secondary', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/*pathology', 'Fatal Outcome', 'Humans', 'Keratoacanthoma/diagnostic imaging/*pathology', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*pathology', 'Lung Neoplasms/secondary', 'Lymphatic Metastasis', 'Male', 'Mediastinal Neoplasms/secondary', 'Middle Aged', 'Orbital Diseases/diagnostic imaging/*pathology', 'Orbital Neoplasms/*pathology', 'Tomography, X-Ray Computed']",2000/05/04 09:00,2000/06/10 09:00,['2000/05/04 09:00'],"['2000/05/04 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/06/10 09:00 [medline]', '2000/05/04 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1034/j.1600-0420.2000.078002223.x [doi]'],ppublish,Acta Ophthalmol Scand. 2000 Apr;78(2):223-5. doi: 10.1034/j.1600-0420.2000.078002223.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Trisomy 12 and deletions of chromosome 13 have been described in small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL). To determine whether chromosomal aberrations could be detected by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) on fine-needle aspiration biopsies (FNABs), we analyzed and compared specimens from seven patients with SLL and nine patients with a history of SLL that had transformed to large cell lymphoma. METHODS: DNA probes specific to chromosome 12 and the chromosome 13/RB-1 gene locus were used for in situ hybridization on interphase cell nuclei. The cytologic features, ploidy, proliferation index, and conventional cytogenetic analysis findings were correlated with the FISH results. RESULTS: Trisomy 12 was detected in 2 (29%) of the 7 cases of SLL and 2 (22%) of the 9 cases of transformed large cell lymphoma. Deletion of chromosome 13/RB-1 was present in 3 (43%) of 7 cases of SLL and 3 (33%) of 9 cases of transformed large cell lymphoma. CONCLUSIONS: This study showed that interphase cytogenetic analysis by FISH is feasible on FNAB specimens. Trisomy 12 and deletions of chromosome 13/RB-1 were present in some cases of SLL and transformed large cell lymphoma, and the presence of these chromosomal abnormalities did not correlate with transformation to a higher grade of lymphoma.","['Caraway, N P', 'Du, Y', 'Zhang, H Z', 'Hayes, K', 'Glassman, A B', 'Katz, R L']","['Caraway NP', 'Du Y', 'Zhang HZ', 'Hayes K', 'Glassman AB', 'Katz RL']","['Department of Pathology, The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston 77030, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Biopsy, Needle', '*Chromosome Aberrations', 'Female', 'Humans', '*In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*genetics/pathology', 'Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse/*genetics/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged']",2000/05/04 09:00,2000/05/16 09:00,['2000/05/04 09:00'],"['2000/05/04 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/05/16 09:00 [medline]', '2000/05/04 09:00 [entrez]']","['10.1002/(SICI)1097-0142(20000425)90:2<126::AID-CNCR8>3.0.CO;2-9 [pii]', '10.1002/(sici)1097-0142(20000425)90:2<126::aid-cncr8>3.0.co;2-9 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer. 2000 Apr 25;90(2):126-32. doi: 10.1002/(sici)1097-0142(20000425)90:2<126::aid-cncr8>3.0.co;2-9.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

(1) In microbial systems, the compounds exerted activity, as assessed in 14 bacterial strains. The effect of canavanine was easily removed by equimolar concentrations of arginine or ornithine, while the effect of CBCH or CPH was abolished by 10-fold excess of arginine or 10- to 100-fold excess of ornithine. (2) In plants, the activity of CH and CBCH were relatively low, whereas the inhibitory potential of CPH was comparable or even superior to that of canavanine, resulting at 1 mM concentration in a nearly complete block of tomato cell growth, and reducing by up to 80% the length of radicles of cress, amaranth, cabbage and pumpkin. (3) In pumpkin seeds, CPH or canavanine induced the synthesis of four small heat shock proteins of hsp-17 family in the pH range of 6 to 7.5. The proteins exhibited in both cases a similar profile, but differed in the timing of their expression and/or accumulation. With canavanine, the highest hsp-17 expression was found after 48 h of drug treatment, while with CPH this maximum was shifted to 24 h. (4) CPH proved to be highly cytotoxic against Friend leukemia cells in culture, exceeding by one order of magnitude the cytotoxicity of canavanine. The effect of canavanine was completely removed in the presence of equimolar amounts of arginine, while a 20-fold excess of arginine failed to abolish the cytotoxicity of CPH. Thus, a proper hydrazide modification of canavanine may lead to a significant increase in its growth-inhibitory activity and to a change in the mode of action of the parent compound.","['Miersch, J', 'Grancharov, K', 'Pajpanova, T', 'Tabakova, S', 'Stoev, S', 'Krauss, G J', 'Golovinsky, E']","['Miersch J', 'Grancharov K', 'Pajpanova T', 'Tabakova S', 'Stoev S', 'Krauss GJ', 'Golovinsky E']","['Institute of Biochemistry, Martin-Luther-University, Halle, Federal Republic of Germany. miersch@biochemtech.uni-halle.de']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Austria,Amino Acids,Amino acids,9200312,IM,"['Animals', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents/metabolism', 'Bacteria/drug effects', 'Canavanine/*analogs & derivatives/*chemical synthesis/metabolism/toxicity', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Electrophoresis, Gel, Two-Dimensional', 'Friend murine leukemia virus/metabolism', 'Hydrazines/*chemical synthesis/*metabolism/toxicity', 'Hydrogen-Ion Concentration', 'Inhibitory Concentration 50', 'Leukemia, Experimental/metabolism', 'Lycopersicon esculentum/drug effects', 'Mice', 'Plants/drug effects', 'Time Factors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2000/05/04 09:00,2000/07/15 11:00,['2000/05/04 09:00'],"['2000/05/04 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/07/15 11:00 [medline]', '2000/05/04 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s007260050004 [doi]'],ppublish,Amino Acids. 2000;18(1):41-59. doi: 10.1007/s007260050004.,"['0 (Anti-Bacterial Agents)', '0 (Hydrazines)', '0 (canavanine phenylhydrazide)', '0 (canavanine-bis-(2-chloroethyl)hydrazide)', '3HZV514J4B (Canavanine)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The extent of methylation of a number of homogenous tRNA species was measured using the purified enzyme from both sources.

INTERVENTION: Conditioning regimen of carmustine, amsacrine, etoposide VP-16, cytarabine, and infusion of unpurged marrow. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Median time taken to reach neutrophil and platelet counts of > or =0.5 x 10(9) /L and > or = x 10(9) /L, respectively; mortality and relapse rates; and follow-up regimens used. RESULTS: Engraftment was successfully achieved in all patients and there were no early procedure-related mortalities. The median times required to reach a neutrophil count of > or =0.5 x 10(9) /L and a platelet count of > or =20 x 10(9) /L were 30 days (range, 18-36 days) and 38 days (range, 15-53 days), respectively.

Two patients experienced relapses: one at 8 months post-transplantation, for which conventional chemotherapy was restarted, and one at 18 months; treatment with all-trans-retinoic acid and conventional chemotherapy achieved a third complete remission in the latter patient, who had acute promyelocytic leukaemia. Continuous remission has been achieved in four of the eight patients after a median follow-up duration of 26 months (range, 6-43 months).

The HTLV-I promoter contains three copies of a Tax-responsive element (TRE-1), each of which possesses a core cAMP response element (CRE). The cAMP response element-binding protein, CREB, binds TRE-1 and mediates Tax association with, and transactivation of, the viral promoter. These activities depend on DNA sequences that flank the core CRE. Although CREs are found in a variety of cellular promoters, cellular CREs vary in sequence from TRE-1, especially in the flanking regions, and are generally not Tax responsive. The molecular basis for differential Tax responsiveness of viral and cellular CREs has not been determined. Here we demonstrate that the conformation of CREB is influenced by the nucleotide sequence of its DNA-binding element. CREB showed altered sensitivity to V8, chymotrypsin, and trypsin proteases when bound to the HTLV-I TRE-1 element as compared to the rat somatostatin CRE element. The phosphorylation state of CREB did not influence its protease sensitivity on either element. Sequences flanking the core CRE-binding site in each element were found to specify protease sensitivity. Since the TRE-1-flanking sequences also modulate Tax association with CREB, and Tax transactivation of CREB-dependent LTR transcription, these results suggest that CREB conformation may determine the ability of Tax to bind CREB.","['Connor, L M', 'Marriott, S J']","['Connor LM', 'Marriott SJ']","['Department of Molecular Virology and Microbiology, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas 77030, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Virology,Virology,0110674,IM,"['Animals', 'Binding Sites/genetics', 'Cyclic AMP Response Element-Binding Protein/chemistry/*genetics/metabolism', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Viral', 'Gene Products, tax/chemistry/*genetics/metabolism', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Conformation', 'Rats']",2000/05/04 09:00,2000/06/17 09:00,['2000/05/04 09:00'],"['2000/05/04 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/06/17 09:00 [medline]', '2000/05/04 09:00 [entrez]']","['10.1006/viro.2000.0262 [doi]', 'S0042-6822(00)90262-9 [pii]']",ppublish,Virology. 2000 May 10;270(2):328-36. doi: 10.1006/viro.2000.0262.,"['0 (Cyclic AMP Response Element-Binding Protein)', '0 (Gene Products, tax)']",,,['Copyright 2000 Academic Press.'],"['CA-55684/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32CA09197/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Tax was demonstrated to bind to topoisomerase I in vitro, and the Tax-topoisomerase I complex was also detected in HTLV-1-infected T-cells by immunoprecipitation. Furthermore, Tax inhibited the catalytic activity of topoisomerase I as measured by relaxation of supercoiled DNA, although complete inhibition was not observed under the conditions used. The binding of topoisomerase I to DNA was inhibited by the addition of the wild type of Tax but not by a mutant of Tax that cannot bind to topoisomerase I. Consistent with these observations, expression of Tax induced an in vivo reduction of the covalent association of topoisomerase I with chromosomal DNA, which accumulates in the presence of camptothecin. These results suggest that Tax has a novel potential to affect various cellular processes such as transcription and maintenance of genomic stability, in which DNA topoisomerase I is involved.","['Suzuki, T', 'Uchida-Toita, M', 'Andoh, T', 'Yoshida, M']","['Suzuki T', 'Uchida-Toita M', 'Andoh T', 'Yoshida M']","['Department of Cellular and Molecular Biology, Institute of Medical Science, Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Virology,Virology,0110674,IM,"['Catalysis', 'DNA Topoisomerases, Type I/genetics/*metabolism', 'DNA, Complementary/genetics/isolation & purification', 'Gene Products, tax/genetics/*metabolism', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/genetics/virology', 'Protein Binding']",2000/05/04 09:00,2000/06/17 09:00,['2000/05/04 09:00'],"['2000/05/04 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/06/17 09:00 [medline]', '2000/05/04 09:00 [entrez]']","['10.1006/viro.2000.0266 [doi]', 'S0042-6822(00)90266-6 [pii]']",ppublish,Virology. 2000 May 10;270(2):291-8. doi: 10.1006/viro.2000.0266.,"['0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (Gene Products, tax)', 'EC 5.99.1.2 (DNA Topoisomerases, Type I)']",,,['Copyright 2000 Academic Press.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We examined here the role of nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) and caspases in the regulation of activation and apoptosis of macrophages. Activation of the human monoblastic leukaemia cell line, U937, by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) increased the expression of CD14/CD86, and cytokine production. PMA stimulation also increased the expression of both pro-caspase-8 and pro-caspase-3 in U937, but not apoptosis or intracellular caspase-3 activity. PMA also increased the expression of X-chromosome-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein (XIAP) in U937, suggesting an inhibitory action for XIAP on the caspase cascade in PMA-stimulated U937. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) showed a significant increase of nuclear NF-kappaB activity in PMA-stimulated U937. When a potent NF-kappaB inhibitor, pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate (PDTC), was added to U937 cell culture in the presence of PMA, apoptosis was triggered by activation of caspase-3, which was induced by caspase-8 activation. XIAP expression was markedly suppressed in PMA-treated U937 in the presence of PDTC. The inhibitors of caspase-8 and caspase-3 mostly inhibited apoptosis of U937 treated with PMA in the presence of PDTC.

In this work we transfected human CD9 into the rat basophilic leukaemia (RBL-2H3) cell line and studied the stimulation of secretion from these cells in response to a panel of anti-CD9 antibodies. Intact immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1) antibodies activated transfected cells whereas F(ab')2 fragments of antibody and an intact IgG2a did not. Stimulation of secretion was inhibited by co-incubation with monomer murine immunoglobulin E (IgE) but not with an IgG1 isotype control, indicating that the response involves the endogenous high-affinity IgE receptor (FcepsilonRI). The anti-CD9 antibody activation curve was biphasic, and supraoptimal antibody concentrations stimulated little or no degranulation, indicating that multivalent binding of human CD9 molecules is necessary for the formation of an active complex with rat FcepsilonRI. Immunoprecipitation of FcepsilonRI under mild detergent conditions co-precipitated CD9, suggesting the presence of pre-existing complexes of CD9 and FcepsilonRI that could be activated by antibody cross-linking. These data are further evidence that tetraspanins are involved in FcepsilonRI signalling and may reflect the participation of tetraspanins in the formation of complexes with other membrane proteins that use components of Fc receptors for signal transduction.","['Higginbottom, A', 'Wilkinson, I', 'McCullough, B', 'Lanza, F', 'Azorsa, D O', 'Partridge, L J', 'Monk, P N']","['Higginbottom A', 'Wilkinson I', 'McCullough B', 'Lanza F', 'Azorsa DO', 'Partridge LJ', 'Monk PN']","['Department of Molecular Biology and Biotechnology, University of Sheffield, Sheffield, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Immunology,Immunology,0374672,IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/*immunology', 'Antigens, CD/genetics/*immunology', 'Cell Line', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin G/*immunology', 'Leukemia, Basophilic, Acute/*immunology', 'Lymphocyte Activation/*immunology', 'Lymphocytes/immunology', '*Membrane Glycoproteins', 'Rats', 'Receptors, IgE/*immunology', 'Tetraspanin 29', 'Transfection']",2000/05/03 09:00,2000/06/03 09:00,['2000/05/03 09:00'],"['2000/05/03 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/06/03 09:00 [medline]', '2000/05/03 09:00 [entrez]']","['imm992 [pii]', '10.1046/j.1365-2567.2000.00992.x [doi]']",ppublish,Immunology. 2000 Apr;99(4):546-52. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2567.2000.00992.x.,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (CD9 protein, human)', '0 (Immunoglobulin G)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Receptors, IgE)', '0 (Tetraspanin 29)']",,PMC2327194,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It has been previously reported that B7.1 gene transfer in a murine leukaemia model induced a potent antileukaemic immunity and that relative expression of B7.1 and B7.2 in human acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) had prognostic significance. As ex vivo engineering of leukaemic cells for immunotherapy protocols would require prior irradiation of these cells before reinjection to the patient, we investigated in murine and leukaemic cell lines and in 20 ex vivo primary cultured acute myeloid leukaemic cells the effect of gamma-irradiation on the expression of B7 molecules. We observed that gamma-irradiation enhanced B7.1 molecule expression in murine leukaemic cell lines and in B7.2 molecules in human HL60 and K562 cell lines. gamma-Irradiation induced B7.1 molecule expression in 90% AML samples but only 21% showed B7.2 molecule expression enhancement. B7.1 expression was increased both at the protein and RNA level in human AML cells but only at the protein level in the DA1-3b murine cell line. Oxidative stress increased B7.1 expression in the murine DA1-3b cell line but human cell lines and AML samples remained unaffected both by heat shock and oxidative stress, suggesting different pathways of B7.1 induction between mouse and human cells.

The use of high-dose single-agent busulphan before allogeneic or autologous SCT may be a reasonable compromise between maintaining cytoreductive efficacy and minimizing toxicity in patients with chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML). Seventy patients with CML have received busulphan as the only cytoreductive therapy before SCT on 79 occasions. The probability of survival of the 14 allogeneic recipients (all of whom were undergoing a second transplant from the original donor) was 78% at 5 years. Sixty-five autologous SCT were performed in 56 patients, of whom 40 were in late chronic phase. The actuarial 3-year post-autograft survival was 54% for these 56 first autografts. For patients in chronic phase, the 3-year survival was 76% compared with 30% at 2 years for those with advanced phase disease. Busulphan therapy was well tolerated, and except for mild mucositis little toxicity was experienced. None of these patients developed hepatic veno-occlusive disease (VOD). Nine patients (one allogeneic and eight autologous recipients) received several doses of an intravenous formulation of busulphan with very low toxicity. High-dose busulphan alone appears sufficient to provide adequate cytoreduction and immunosuppression in second allogeneic transplants and is also effective as cytoreduction before autologous SCT in patients with CML.","['Olavarria, E', 'Kanfer, E', 'Szydlo, R', ""O'Brien, S"", 'Craddock, C', 'Apperley, J', 'Goldman, J']","['Olavarria E', 'Kanfer E', 'Szydlo R', ""O'Brien S"", 'Craddock C', 'Apperley J', 'Goldman J']","['Department of Haematology, Hammersmith Hospital, ICSM, London, UK. e.olavarria@ic.ac.uk']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Busulfan/*administration & dosage', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Female', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*methods', 'Humans', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/*administration & dosage', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/mortality/*therapy', 'Male', 'Recurrence', 'Survival Rate', 'Transplantation Conditioning/*methods', 'Transplantation, Autologous', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",2000/05/03 09:00,2000/06/17 09:00,['2000/05/03 09:00'],"['2000/05/03 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/06/17 09:00 [medline]', '2000/05/03 09:00 [entrez]']","['bjh1905 [pii]', '10.1046/j.1365-2141.2000.01905.x [doi]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2000 Mar;108(4):769-77. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2141.2000.01905.x.,"['0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)', 'G1LN9045DK (Busulfan)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To determine whether the increasing MC in these patients is caused by the reappearance of normal recipient haematopoiesis or by the reoccurrence of malignant cells, we purified different leucocyte subpopulations and analysed these subfractions with regard to their donor-recipient ratio by a PCR-based method for the analysis of minisatellite DNA regions. In 14 patients [eight acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL), three acute myelogenous leukaemia (AML) and three MDS] subfractions were analysed when increasing MC was first noted upon serial analysis of the peripheral blood. In seven of these 14 patients (four ALL, two AML and one MDS), subfractions were characterized at the time of frank haematological relapse. In all 14 patients investigated with increasing MC, recipient cells were detected in different mononuclear cell subpopulations. In patients characterized during frank relapse, two distinct distribution patterns were found. Patients who relapsed before day +300 (one ALL, two AML and one MDS) showed recipient-derived (normal) cells in addition to blast populations in different mononuclear subsets as well as granulocytes. In patients with acute leukaemias who relapsed after day +300 (two ALL and one AML), only leukaemic cells were found that were of recipient origin, whereas all other haematopoietic cell lines were donor derived. These data show that persistent MC in the early post-transplant period is caused predominantly by normal recipient haematopoietic cells. This finding further supports the hypothesis that a state of mixed haematopoietic chimaerism may reduce the clinical graft-versus-leukaemia (GVL) effect of alloreactive donor-derived effector cells in patients with acute leukaemias and MDS, and thus facilitate the proliferation of residual malignant cells that may have survived the preparative regimen.","['Bader, P', 'Stoll, K', 'Huber, S', 'Geiselhart, A', 'Handgretinger, R', 'Niemeyer, C', 'Einsele, H', 'Schlegel, P G', 'Niethammer, D', 'Beck, J', 'Klingebiel, T']","['Bader P', 'Stoll K', 'Huber S', 'Geiselhart A', 'Handgretinger R', 'Niemeyer C', 'Einsele H', 'Schlegel PG', 'Niethammer D', 'Beck J', 'Klingebiel T']","[""University Children's Hospital, Tubingen, Germany. peter.bader@med.uni-tuebingen.de""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Graft vs Host Disease/blood', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/blood/therapy', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/blood/*therapy', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/blood/therapy', 'Recurrence', 'Time Factors', '*Transplantation Chimera', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",2000/05/03 09:00,2000/06/17 09:00,['2000/05/03 09:00'],"['2000/05/03 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/06/17 09:00 [medline]', '2000/05/03 09:00 [entrez]']","['bjh1927 [pii]', '10.1046/j.1365-2141.2000.01927.x [doi]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2000 Mar;108(4):761-8. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2141.2000.01927.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In an attempt to reduce the high procedure-related mortality reported with allografting in lymphoma, we have used BEAM (BCNU, etoposide, cytarabine and melphalan), a standard conditioning regimen for autologous transplantation. As BEAM may be insufficiently immunosuppressive to permit durable engraftment in the allogeneic setting, patients received additional pretransplant immunosuppression with the anti-CD52 antibody CAMPATH-1G from day -5 to day -1. Twelve patients (median age 46 years) underwent allogeneic transplantation for lymphoma (n = 11) or chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (n = 1) from HLA-identical (n = 9) or mismatched (n = 3) sibling donors. Cyclosporin A and methotrexate were used as graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis. One patient died of progressive lymphoma at day +12, the remaining 11 patients engrafted rapidly, with eight demonstrating full donor chimerism. One patient had an episode of rejection and received a further stem cell infusion with sustained recovery. Only one patient developed GVHD (grade I). The low incidence of acute GVHD may be in part related to persisting levels of in vivo CAMPATH-IG at the time of transplantation. Of 11 evaluable patients, nine achieved complete remission (CR), and a further patient achieved CR after donor lymphocyte infusion at 5 months. Our preliminary experience is that this regimen was well tolerated with a low risk of GVHD and appears no more toxic than a BEAM autograft. Further follow-up is required to see whether the low incidence of GVHD impacts upon relapse risk.","['Cull, G M', 'Haynes, A P', 'Byrne, J L', 'Carter, G I', 'Miflin, G', 'Rebello, P', 'Hale, G', 'Waldmann, H', 'Russell, N H']","['Cull GM', 'Haynes AP', 'Byrne JL', 'Carter GI', 'Miflin G', 'Rebello P', 'Hale G', 'Waldmann H', 'Russell NH']","['Division of Haematology, School of Clinical and Laboratory Sciences, University of Nottingham, UK.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,IM,"['Adult', 'Alemtuzumab', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/*administration & dosage', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized', 'Antibodies, Neoplasm', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Carmustine/administration & dosage', 'Cyclosporine/therapeutic use', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease/prevention & control', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*methods', 'Humans', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/*administration & dosage/blood', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/blood/therapy', 'Lymphoma/blood/therapy', 'Lymphoproliferative Disorders/blood/*therapy', 'Male', 'Melphalan/administration & dosage', 'Methotrexate/therapeutic use', 'Middle Aged', 'Podophyllotoxin/administration & dosage', 'Transplantation Conditioning/*methods', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",2000/05/03 09:00,2000/06/17 09:00,['2000/05/03 09:00'],"['2000/05/03 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/06/17 09:00 [medline]', '2000/05/03 09:00 [entrez]']","['bjh1879 [pii]', '10.1046/j.1365-2141.2000.01879.x [doi]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2000 Mar;108(4):754-60. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2141.2000.01879.x.,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized)', '0 (Antibodies, Neoplasm)', '0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '3A189DH42V (Alemtuzumab)', '83HN0GTJ6D (Cyclosporine)', 'L36H50F353 (Podophyllotoxin)', 'Q41OR9510P (Melphalan)', 'U68WG3173Y (Carmustine)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)', 'BEAM protocol']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Patients were randomized to receive chlorambucil 0.1 mg/kg/d or chlorambucil 0.3 mg/kg/d orally for 7 d, repeated every 6 weeks. Criteria for response included 50% or more reduction of serum M-protein, increase in haemoglobin level of 2 g/dl without transfusion, >/= 50% decrease of urine M-protein, or a reduction of 2 cm in the size of the liver, spleen or lymph nodes. Forty-six patients were randomized to continuous chlorambucil (n = 24) or to intermittent chlorambucil (n = 22). Nineteen (79%) (95% CI = 58-93) of the 24 patients given continuous therapy had an objective improvement by either reduction of serum M-protein or increase in haemoglobin.

However, the malignant potentiality of AISA has always been a matter of debate. In different series, median survival and rates of transformation into acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) varied extensively. On cytomorphological grounds, AISA can be divided into pure (dyserythropoietic) sideroblastic anaemia (PSA), in which dysplasia is confined to erythropoietic cells, and a true myelodysplastic form (RARS), which is characterized by additional dysplastic features of granulopoiesis and/or megakaryopoiesis. In a previous study, based on retrospective analysis of 94 patients with AISA, we found that both types of sideroblastic anaemia differed considerably in terms of survival and risk of AML transformation. Almost identical results have now been obtained through a prospective study of 232 new patients with AISA. The difference in survival between PSA and RARS remained significant over the whole period of follow-up (survival after 3 years being 77% vs. 56%; P = 0.003), and the incidence of AML did not increase with time in the PSA group, even in the long term.

We investigated leukaemic cells co-expressing CD15 and CD117 (CD15+CD117+) in 72 adult AML cases at diagnosis. In 22 cases (31%) with various AML subtypes, more than 5% of leukaemic cells showed the CD15+CD117+ phenotype (range 5.22-55.48%). These 22 cases were younger and had a higher complete remission (CR) rate than the other AML cases, but the CD15+CD117+ cell percentage at diagnosis showed no correlation with the CR duration among the 72 cases. The CD15+CD117+ cell percentage showed a range of 0.00-0.08% in bone marrow cells from 10 haematologically normal subjects. We also investigated CD15+CD117+ cells in sequential bone marrow samples from 17 AML patients who achieved CR and who had had more than 5% CD15+CD117+ leukaemic cells at diagnosis. Because the CD15+CD117+ cell percentage varied among these AML cases, we calculated the percentage of MRD inverted question markMRD% = [CD15+CD117+ cells (%) in each sequential marrow sample] / [CD15+CD117+ cells (%) at diagnosis of the corresponding case] x 100 inverted question mark. A high MRD% after 10 months of CR was significantly associated with a short CR duration (P = 0.0004), whereas continuation of a well-reduced MRD% was associated with a long CR duration. The leukaemic cells conserved the CD15+CD117+ phenotype in all of the eight cases who relapsed. Flow cytometric monitoring of CD15+CD117+ cells is simple and can be applied to a substantial fraction of AML cases. This monitoring may be useful for predicting relapse of adult AML.","['Nakamura, K', 'Ogata, K', 'An, E', 'Dan, K']","['Nakamura K', 'Ogata K', 'An E', 'Dan K']","['Third Department of Internal Medicine, Nippon Medical School, Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Bone Marrow Cells/*immunology', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*immunology', 'Lewis X Antigen/*immunology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm, Residual/*diagnosis/immunology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit/*immunology', 'Recurrence']",2000/05/03 09:00,2000/06/17 09:00,['2000/05/03 09:00'],"['2000/05/03 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/06/17 09:00 [medline]', '2000/05/03 09:00 [entrez]']","['bjh1906 [pii]', '10.1046/j.1365-2141.2000.01906.x [doi]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2000 Mar;108(4):710-6. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2141.2000.01906.x.,"['0 (Lewis X Antigen)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Cellular daunorubicin accumulation was also evaluated. At onset, no case had PGP or MRP1 expression that exceeded that of non-multidrug-resistant (MDR) cell lines. Only one case showed LRP overexpression. No peculiar MDR features distinguished the seven patients who relapsed from those who maintained complete remission. In the onset vs. first relapse, only one patient showed an increased (threefold) PGP expression at relapse. At second relapse, three out of four patients showed a PGP expression two- to threefold higher than baseline values. These results are consistent with the view that low PGP, LRP and MRP1 expression and the absence of defects in intracellular drug accumulation may account for the peculiarly high sensitivity of APLs to anthracycline. It does not support the screening of MDR markers in APL patients at onset as predicting factors of early relapse. The results suggest that no significant changes in PGP, LRP or MRP1 expression are likely to occur at first relapse. In contrast, PGP expression is likely to increase later in the patient history as a result of additional chemotherapy courses.","['Michieli, M', 'Damiani, D', 'Ermacora, A', 'Geromin, A', 'Michelutti, A', 'Masolini, P', 'Baccarani, M']","['Michieli M', 'Damiani D', 'Ermacora A', 'Geromin A', 'Michelutti A', 'Masolini P', 'Baccarani M']","['Division of Haematology, Department of Medical and Morphological Research, University Hospital, Udine, Italy.

Molecular studies have shown that histone deacetylase (HDAC) recruited by PLZF-RARalpha is associated with the ATRA resistance. Here, we analysed in vitro the differentiation of APL cells with t(11;17) using ATRA, As203, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), HDAC inhibitor trichostatin A (TSA), or combinations of these. Although 1 microM ATRA, which stimulated the differentiation of APL cells with t(15;17), was insufficient to induce differentiation, 3 microM ATRA induced terminal differentiation into granulocytes. As203 alone or in combination with ATRA induced neither differentiation nor apoptosis. However, the combination of TSA and 1 microM ATRA had a potent differentiating effect, although TSA alone had little effect. The combination of 1 microM ATRA and G-CSF did not induce differentiation. These results indicate that APL cells with t(11;17) need a higher concentration of ATRA than those with t(15;17) to differentiate and suggest that HDAC inhibitor is a promising differentiation enhancer in APL with t(11;17).","['Kitamura, K', 'Hoshi, S', 'Koike, M', 'Kiyoi, H', 'Saito, H', 'Naoe, T']","['Kitamura K', 'Hoshi S', 'Koike M', 'Kiyoi H', 'Saito H', 'Naoe T']","['Department of Infectious Diseases, Nagoya University School of Medicine, Nagoya, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 11', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 17', 'Drug Therapy, Combination', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*therapeutic use', 'Female', '*Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors', 'Humans', 'Hydroxamic Acids/*therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*drug therapy/genetics', 'Male', 'Oxides/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Translocation, Genetic', 'Tretinoin/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects']",2000/05/03 09:00,2000/06/17 09:00,['2000/05/03 09:00'],"['2000/05/03 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/06/17 09:00 [medline]', '2000/05/03 09:00 [entrez]']","['bjh1933 [pii]', '10.1046/j.1365-2141.2000.01933.x [doi]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2000 Mar;108(4):696-702. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2141.2000.01933.x.,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors)', '0 (Hydroxamic Acids)', '0 (Oxides)', '3X2S926L3Z (trichostatin A)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Their age, gender, presenting symptoms, presence of urinary tract abnormalities, radiological imaging and treatment were assessed. RESULTS: All 16 children received intensive intravenous and oral antibiotics. Ten required intervention for predisposing conditions including vesico-ureteric reflux (four), bladder diverticulum (one), renal and peri-rectal abscess (two), ureteric or bladder calculi (two), and renal mass (one). In addition, three children had reflux not requiring surgery; one had multiple renal calyceal diverticula, one had Hinman syndrome and one had leukaemia. CONCLUSION: Acute focal bacterial nephritis is being diagnosed with increasing frequency through increasing awareness and advances in imaging modalities. Active urological evaluation is warranted because of the high incidence of urinary tract abnormalities.

This general pattern can be attributed to an optimal induction of error-free DNA repair in a DR region of minimal mutability (MMDR region). The diminished activation of repair at very low DRs may reflect a low ratio of induced (""signal"") to spontaneous background DNA damage (""noise""). Because two common DNA lesions, 8-oxoguanine and thymine glycol, were already known to activate repair in irradiated mammalian cells, we estimated how their rates of production are altered upon radiation exposure in the MMDR region. For these and other abundant lesions (abasic sites and single-strand breaks), the DNA damage rate increment in the MMDR region is in the range of 10% to 100% (rule 2).

These features suggest that CLL cells may have sustained mutations affecting one or more of the BCR proteins required for receptor surface assembly and signal transduction. Loss of expression and mutations in the critical BCR protein B29 (Igbeta, CD79b), are prevalent in CLL and could produce the hallmark features of these leukemic B cells. Because patient CLL cells are intractable to manipulation, we developed a model system to analyze B29 mutations. Jurkat T cells stably expressing micro, kappa, and mb1 efficiently assembled a functional BCR when infected with recombinant vaccinia virus bearing wild-type B29. In contrast, a B29 CLL mutant protein truncated in the transmembrane domain did not associate with mu or mb1 at the cell surface. Another B29 CLL mutant lacking the C-terminal immunoreceptor tyrosine activation motif tyrosine and distal residues brought the receptor to the surface as well as wild-type B29 but showed significant impairment in anti-IgM-stimulated signaling events including mitogen-activated protein kinase activation. These findings demonstrate that B29 mutations previously identified in CLL patients can affect BCR-dependent signaling and may contribute to the unresponsive B cell phenotype in CLL. Finally, the features of the B29 mutations in CLL predict that they may be generated by somatic hypermutation.","['Gordon, M S', 'Kato, R M', 'Lansigan, F', 'Thompson, A A', 'Wall, R', 'Rawlings, D J']","['Gordon MS', 'Kato RM', 'Lansigan F', 'Thompson AA', 'Wall R', 'Rawlings DJ']","['Molecular Biology Institute, Department of Microbiology, Division of Immunology/Rheumatology, University of California School of Medicine, Los Angeles, CA 90095, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,IM,"['Antigens, CD/*genetics/immunology', 'B-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'CD79 Antigens', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin M/immunology', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*genetics/*immunology', 'Mutagenesis, Site-Directed', '*Mutation', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/*genetics/immunology', 'Signal Transduction/immunology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2000/05/03 09:00,2000/06/17 09:00,['2000/05/03 09:00'],"['2000/05/03 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/06/17 09:00 [medline]', '2000/05/03 09:00 [entrez]']","['10.1073/pnas.090087097 [doi]', '090087097 [pii]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2000 May 9;97(10):5504-9. doi: 10.1073/pnas.090087097.,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (CD79 Antigens)', '0 (CD79B protein, human)', '0 (Immunoglobulin M)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)']",,PMC25858,,"['R01 CA081140/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA12800/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HD037091/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 GM040185/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'GM40185/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'CA85841/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA085841/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The investigation of potentially synergistic effects of combinations therefore is an important issue in toxicology. Combinations of 511 keV gamma-radiation with the chemical alkylating agent ethyl methane-sulfonate were investigated in the in vitro micronucleus test in mouse lymphoma L5178Y cells. With combinations in the low dose linear effect range for the individual agents (0. 25-2 Gy and 0.8-3.2 mM, respectively), supra-additivity by 34-86% was seen. The synergism was more pronounced at the higher dose levels. Supra-additivity was confirmed in experiments using cytochalasin B and analyzing binucleate cells only, to control for putative effects on the cell cycle. Statistical significance was shown by a 2-factor analysis of variance with interaction. The results indicate that damage to DNA by gamma-radiation and alkylation could affect different rate limiting steps in the formation of micronuclei. Further investigations will have to show whether the observations are of general validity, in particular, whether other end-points of genotoxicity produce the same results and whether the degree of supra-additivity is always dose dependent. The latter would have a strong impact on risk assessment for mixtures at low doses.","['Stopper, H', 'Mueller, S O', 'Lutz, W K']","['Stopper H', 'Mueller SO', 'Lutz WK']","['Department of Toxicology, University of W]urzburg, Versbacher Strabetae 9, D-97078 W]urzburg, Germany. stopper@toxi.uni-wuerzburg.de']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Mutagenesis,Mutagenesis,8707812,IM,"['Animals', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Radiation', 'Ethyl Methanesulfonate/*toxicity', '*Gamma Rays', 'Leukemia L5178', 'Mice', 'Micronuclei, Chromosome-Defective/drug effects/radiation effects', 'Micronucleus Tests', 'Mutagens/*toxicity', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2000/05/03 09:00,2000/08/01 11:00,['2000/05/03 09:00'],"['2000/05/03 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/08/01 11:00 [medline]', '2000/05/03 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/mutage/15.3.235 [doi]'],ppublish,Mutagenesis. 2000 May;15(3):235-8. doi: 10.1093/mutage/15.3.235.,"['0 (Mutagens)', '9H154DI0UP (Ethyl Methanesulfonate)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We used hMSC to support retroviral gene transfer of the G156A MGMT (deltaMGMT) gene encoding an alkyltransferase (AGT), which confers drug resistance to a combination of O6-benzylguanine (BG) plus the alkylating agents BCNU and temozolomide (TMZ) in human hematopoietic progenitors. In the presence of IL-3, IL-6, SCF, or leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) and Flt-3 ligand, hMSC facilitated expansion and retroviral transduction of human peripheral blood-mobilized CD34+ cells. Furthermore, the transduced cells expressed AGT in 29% of hematopoietic cells and were 5-fold more resistant to BCNU and TMZ than were untransduced cells. Unirradiated hMSC present as support cells were simultaneously transduced and expressed AGT in 26% of the cells.

The transfer and expression of the MRP1 gene in human hematopoietic stem cells may be a useful alternative to multidrug resistance (MDR1) gene transfer for protection from the myelosuppressive effects of chemotherapy in cancer patients. We constructed a gibbon ape leukemia virus packaging cell line (PG13) using the human MRP1 cDNA in a Moloney murine leukemia virus (MoMuLV) backbone containing a modified LTR. This PG13-based cell line, designated MRP1-PG13, produces retroviral vectors bearing the MRP1 gene at a titer of 1.7x10(5) viral particles/ml. Transduction of the human leukemic cell line K562 showed that viral MRP1-PG13 supernatants routinely transfer the MRP1 gene to approximately 35% of target K562 cells, of which at least one third are capable of proliferating in the presence of otherwise toxic concentrations of etoposide. Southern blot analyses indicated that most clones had only one proviral integration. Northern blot analysis of expanded K562 clones showed the presence of a major full-length approximately 8-kb MRP1 transcript as well as a minor approximately 6-kb transcript in all clones. Flow cytometric analysis of the producer cells and clones of transduced K562 cells demonstrated significantly increased MRP1 expression in these cells (approximately 30-fold increase). Human bone marrow mononuclear cells and CD34+ cells were also transduced with MRP1-PG13 supernatants on fibronectin-coated culture flasks in the presence of SCF, IL-3, and IL-6. PCR analysis of individual hematopoietic colonies in methylcellulose cultures demonstrated proviral DNA in approximately 10% of unselected human hematopoietic progenitor cells cultured from nonsorted mononuclear cell samples and in up to approximately 75% of progenitors when CD34-enriched cell populations were targeted. To assess functional MRP1 gene expression, normal human hematopoietic progenitors and K562 cells were cultured in methylcellulose assays containing vincristine or etoposide. All transduced samples gave rise to approximately 10% drug-resistant colonies, which were shown to be provirus-positive by PCR.

The IFN-alpha gene expression in transduced K562 cells was confirmed by Northern blot, RT-PCR, RIA, and biologic assay. Cell proliferation and cell viability in IFN-alpha-transduced K562 cells were significantly suppressed as compared with control K562 cells. Although the IFN-alpha expression in K562 cells did not affect BCR/ABL expression, it apparently upregulated the production of adhesion molecules (VLA-4 and Mac-1). We evaluated the effect of IFN-alpha gene transfer on human CD34+ cells infected with LSN-IFN-alpha retrovirus with the aid of fibronectin (FN) fragment CH-296 and growth factors. RIA showed that IFN-alpha-transduced CD34+ cells produced 72.2+/-15 U/ml of IFN-alpha compared with 4.3+/-1.2 U/ml in control CD34+ cells.

The polyagglutinable state may be transient or persistent. Transient polyagglutinability results from the exposure of normally cryptic antigens by bacterial enzymatic activity during the course of an infectious process. RBCs are polyagglutinable because most sera from adults contain agglutinins for the exposed antigens. This type of polyagglutination can often be reproduced in vitro with bacterial culture fluids or isolated enzymes. Persistent polyagglutination may be a consequence of somatic mutation leading to a cellular lineage characterized by an enzyme deficiency that results in exposure of a normally cryptic antigen, Tn. Most human sera contain anti-Tn. Tn polyagglutination is regularly accompanied by leukopenia and thrombocytopenia and has been associated with leukemia. Other forms of persistent polyagglutination are due to the inheritance of rare blood groups or are associated with a hematologic dyscrasia.","['Beck, M L']",['Beck ML'],"['Community Blood Center of Greater Kansas City, MO 64111, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Semin Hematol,Seminars in hematology,0404514,IM,"['Animals', 'Bacterial Infections/blood/complications/physiopathology', 'Hemagglutination/*immunology', 'Hematologic Diseases/blood/etiology/physiopathology', 'Humans', 'Isoantigens/adverse effects/blood']",2000/05/03 09:00,2000/06/24 11:00,['2000/05/03 09:00'],"['2000/05/03 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/06/24 11:00 [medline]', '2000/05/03 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0037-1963(00)90043-X [pii]', '10.1016/s0037-1963(00)90043-x [doi]']",ppublish,Semin Hematol. 2000 Apr;37(2):186-96. doi: 10.1016/s0037-1963(00)90043-x.,['0 (Isoantigens)'],92,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Acute Leukaemia Working Party of the European Group for Blood and Marrow Transplantation.,1393-8,"BACKGROUND: There is increasing pressure for the recognition and replication of good clinical practice. We undertook a study to assess the variability in outcome of allogeneic bone-marrow transplantation among major European centres. METHODS: We studied 13 centres, including 522 patients (aged 16-55 years), which had undertaken more than 30 bone-marrow transplantations between Jan 1, 1987, and Dec 31, 1995, for acute myeloid leukaemia in first complete remission. We undertook a (global) multivariate analysis of all factors known previously to influence outcome and a stratified analysis that initially defined, by multivariate analysis, significant variables in this study and then used a proportional-hazard model including centres. FINDINGS: The overall results at 3 years were 57% (95% CI 53-61) for leukaemia-free survival (LFS), 23% (19-27) for relapse incidence (RI), and 26% (22-30) for treatment-related mortality (TRM) with a range for centres of 36-75%, 10-37%, and 8-54%, respectively. Both methods of analysis showed the centre effect to be highly significant for LFS and TRM, but not for RI. Variables associated with a significantly poor outcome were age over 43 years (p=0.01), time from diagnosis to first complete remission longer than 65 days (p=0.02), and centre (p=0.013) for LFS, and age over 43 years (p=0.023), time from first complete remission to transplantation of longer than 93 days (p=0.03), and centre (p=0.001) for TRM. Moreover, different centres had different prognostic criteria for good-risk or bad-risk patients indicating that risk factors do not have the same impact in each individual centre. INTERPRETATION: The outcome of bone-marrow transplantation for acute myeloid leukaemia in first complete remission is influenced by the centre in which the procedure is done, even with adjustment for known prognostic risk factors. Significant prognostic factors vary among centres, which means that the relative risk is not the same in each individual centre. However, centres may treat populations with different risks of as yet unidentified prognostic factors. Experience may partly account for the difference in outcome among centres.","['Frassoni, F', 'Labopin, M', 'Powles, R', 'Mary, J Y', 'Arcese, W', 'Bacigalupo, A', 'Bunjes, D', 'Gluckman, E', 'Ruutu, T', 'Schaefer, U W', 'Sierra, J', 'Vernant, J P', 'Willemze, R', 'de Witte, T', 'Gorin, N C']","['Frassoni F', 'Labopin M', 'Powles R', 'Mary JY', 'Arcese W', 'Bacigalupo A', 'Bunjes D', 'Gluckman E', 'Ruutu T', 'Schaefer UW', 'Sierra J', 'Vernant JP', 'Willemze R', 'de Witte T', 'Gorin NC']","['Divisione Ematologia II, Ospedale San Martino, Genova, Italy. frafrassoni@smartino.ge.it']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Lancet,"Lancet (London, England)",2985213R,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/adverse effects/*methods/*mortality', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Europe', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/complications/mortality/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Prognosis', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'Recurrence', 'Remission Induction/methods', 'Risk Factors']",2000/05/03 09:00,2000/05/16 09:00,['2000/05/03 09:00'],"['2000/05/03 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/05/16 09:00 [medline]', '2000/05/03 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0140673600021371 [pii]', '10.1016/s0140-6736(00)02137-1 [doi]']",ppublish,Lancet. 2000 Apr 22;355(9213):1393-8. doi: 10.1016/s0140-6736(00)02137-1.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

There was no significant difference in histopathological and immunohistochemical findings between the rats within 7 months after the HTLV-I infection and age-matched controls. The first sign of demyelination was the appearance of apoptotic cell death beginning at 7 months after the infection and the apoptotic cell number gradually increased to 12 cells per a whole horizontal section of the spinal cord, in contrast to 5 cells in the control rats. The majority of the apoptotic cells were shown to be oligodendrocytes by immunohistochemical stain with an anti-myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein antibody. Increment of activated microglia/macrophages started at 9 months after the infection and they rapidly increased from 15 months to reach 600 cells per a whole horizontal section, in contrast to 300 cells in the control rats. Rapid increase of gemistocytic astrocytes was found from 20 months after the infection (the late disease stage). Molecular analysis of the spinal cords revealed that HTLV-I provirus DNA was evident as early as 4 months after the infection, and massages of HTLV-I pX and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha began to be expressed at 7 months, just before or at the same time as the appearance of the apoptotic cells. The collective evidence suggests that the apoptotic death of oligodendrocytes, which may be induced either directly by the local expression of HTLV-I or indirectly by upregulated cytotoxic humoral mediators, such as TNF-alpha, through the transactive function of p40 Tax, is the major cause of chronic progressive myelopathy in WKAH rats with HTLV-I infection.","['Ohya, O']",['Ohya O'],"['First Department of Pathology, Hokkaido University School of Medicine, Sapporo, Japan.']",['jpn'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Japan,Hokkaido Igaku Zasshi,[Hokkaido igaku zasshi] The Hokkaido journal of medical science,17410290R,IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis', 'Demyelinating Diseases/pathology/virology', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Genome, Viral', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/genetics', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Oligodendroglia/pathology', 'Paraparesis, Tropical Spastic/*pathology/virology', 'Proviruses/genetics', 'Rats', 'Rats, Inbred Strains', 'Spinal Cord/cytology/*virology', 'Time Factors', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/genetics']",2000/05/03 09:00,2000/07/25 11:00,['2000/05/03 09:00'],"['2000/05/03 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/07/25 11:00 [medline]', '2000/05/03 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Hokkaido Igaku Zasshi. 2000 Mar;75(2):117-34.,['0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The usual practice is to give very low individual fractions (0.1 to 0.25 Gy) several times a week, to a total dose of 1.5 to 2 Gy. Despite this low dose, low-dose TBI can induce long-term remissions in the majority of patients. Immune enhancement, rather than direct radiation cell killing, is one of the suggested mechanisms by which low-dose TBI can exert its effect. Data from animal experiments have shown that low-dose TBI could enhance the immune response through (1) augmenting the proliferative reactive response of the T cells to mitogenic stimulation; (2) altering cytokine release, particularly the activation of interferon gamma and Il2 production; (3) increasing the expression of Il2 receptors on the T-cell surface; (4) facilitating signal transduction in T lymphocytes; (5) increasing splenic catecholamine content and lowering the serum corticosterone level; and (6) eliminating a particularly radiosensitive subset of the suppressor T cells. Data for humans, though scarce, suggest that at least some of these mechanisms occur in patients treated with low-dose TBI. Whether these immunomodulatory effects are responsible for the clinical outcome is not yet clear. Much is still unknown about the immunobiology of low-dose TBI, its clinical potential, and the possible synergism with chemotherapy, biological response modifiers, or immunotherapy. This lack of comprehensive knowledge hampers the optimal and widespread use of this intriguing and potentially useful treatment modality in clinical practice.","['Safwat, A']",['Safwat A'],"['Radiotherapy Department, National Cancer Institute, Fom El-khalig, Cairo, Egypt.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Radiat Res,Radiation research,0401245,IM,"['Animals', 'Cytokines/biosynthesis/immunology/*radiation effects', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/radiotherapy', 'Mice', 'Neoplasms/radiotherapy', '*Radiation Dosage', 'T-Lymphocytes/cytology/immunology/*radiation effects', '*Whole-Body Irradiation']",2000/05/02 09:00,2000/06/10 09:00,['2000/05/02 09:00'],"['2000/05/02 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/06/10 09:00 [medline]', '2000/05/02 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1667/0033-7587(2000)153[0599:tioldt]2.0.co;2 [doi]'],ppublish,Radiat Res. 2000 May;153(5 Pt 1):599-604. doi: 10.1667/0033-7587(2000)153[0599:tioldt]2.0.co;2.,['0 (Cytokines)'],39,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We found that there is no change in expression of E2F-1, bax, bclx(L) or bc12 proteins in both LY sublines after x-irradiation. LY-R cells do not constitutively express bc12, whereas both sublines show high bax content. Radiation induces delayed apoptosis to a greater extent in LY-S than in LY-R cells. The apoptosis can be seen 24 h after irradiation (2 Gy) of LY-S cells, with a maximum at 48 h. LY-R cells need 5 Gy and 72 h post-irradiation incubation to show marked apoptosis (identified by the TUNEL method).

This has led to a frequently exaggerated perception of the potential health effects, and to lasting public controversies. A balanced view requires a critical reassessment of the epidemiological basis of current assumptions. There is reliable quantitative information available on the increase of cancer rates due to moderate and high doses. This provides a firm basis for the derivation of probabilities of causation, e.g. after high radiation exposures. For small doses or dose rates, the situation is entirely different: potential increases of cancer rates remain hidden below the statistical fluctuations of normal rates, and the molecular mechanisms of cancerogenesis are not sufficiently well known to allow numerical predictions. Risk coefficients for radiation protection must, therefore, be based on the uncertain extrapolation of observations obtained at moderate or high doses. While extrapolation is arbitrary, it is, nevertheless, used and mostly with the conservative assumption of a linear dose dependence with no threshold (LNT model). All risk estimates are based on this hypothesis. They are, thus, virtual guidelines, rather than firm numbers. The observations on the A-bomb survivors are still the major source of information on the health effects of comparatively small radiation doses. A fairly direct inspection of the data shows that the solid cancer mortality data of the A-bomb survivors are equally consistent with linearity in dose and with reduced effectiveness at low doses. In the leukemia data a reduction is strongly indicated. With one notable exception -- leukemia after prenatal exposure--these observations are in line with a multitude of observations in groups of persons exposed for medical reasons. The low-dose effects of densely ionizing radiations--such as alpha-particles from radon decay products or high-energy neutrons--are a separate important issue. For neutrons, there is little epidemiological information. This has facilitated exaggerated claims of high neutron effects with reference to alleged dangers from transports of reactor fuel. However, in spite of limited information, it can be shown that the data from Hiroshima exclude the stated claims. New dosimetric information on neutrons may turn out to be highly informative with regard to an upper limit for the potential effects of neutrons and equally with regard to a reassessment--and a possible reduction--of risk estimates for gamma-rays.","['Kellerer, A M']",['Kellerer AM'],"['Radiobiological Institute, Ludwig Maximilians University, Munich, Germany. amk.sbi@lrz.uni-muenchen.de']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Germany,Radiat Environ Biophys,Radiation and environmental biophysics,0415677,IM,"['Breast Neoplasms/*epidemiology/*etiology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Japan', 'Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced/*epidemiology', 'Nuclear Warfare', 'Risk Factors']",2000/05/02 09:00,2000/06/10 09:00,['2000/05/02 09:00'],"['2000/05/02 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/06/10 09:00 [medline]', '2000/05/02 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/pl00007679 [doi]'],ppublish,Radiat Environ Biophys. 2000 Mar;39(1):17-24. doi: 10.1007/pl00007679.,,26,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Knox tests for space-time interactions between cases were applied with fixed thresholds of close in space, <5 km and close in time <1 year apart. Addresses at birth as well as diagnosis were utilized. Tests were repeated replacing geographical distance with distance to the Nth nearest neighbour. N was chosen such that the mean distance was 5 km. Data were also examined by a second order procedure based on K-functions. All methods showed highly significant evidence of space-time clustering based on place of birth and time of diagnosis, particularly for all leukaemias aged 0-14 and 0-4 years, and acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) 0-4 years. Some results based on location at diagnosis were significant but mainly gave larger P-values. The results are consistent with an infectious hypothesis. Furthermore, we found an excess of male cases over females involved in space-time pairs. We suggest this may be related to genetic differences in susceptibility to infection between males and females.

Unlike such steroids as estrone, dexamethasone, testosterone and hydrocortisone, PS showed significant inhibitory effect (I50 = 32.5(M) and noncompetitively (Ki = 25(M) inhibited GST P1-1 isolated from human placenta. Pronounced inhibition of K562 cell proliferation by PS was in inverse correlation with the intracellular activity of GST P1-1. Also, PS injected into culture suppressed GST P1-1 expression in leukemia cells. At concentrations of 10(-8)-10(-5) M, both effects proved dose-dependent. The correlation between PS antiproliferative effect on GST P1-1 activity and expression in K562 cells is discussed in terms of its possible role played in malignant growth regulation.","['Kalinina, E V', 'Novichkova, M D', 'Shcherbak, N P', 'Saprin, A N']","['Kalinina EV', 'Novichkova MD', 'Shcherbak NP', 'Saprin AN']","['N.N.

The Fv1 gene determines the susceptibility to retrovirus replication. We sequenced the open reading frame of the Fv1nr allele of 129/Sv mice. It differs by only one nucleotide, modifying one amino acid in the encoded protein, from the Fv1n allele of susceptible AKR and C58 animals. We excluded that the resistance of 129/Sv mice to LDV-induced polioencephalomyelitis resulted from the absence of endogenous N-tropic retrovirus, by infecting (129/Sv x C58/J) F1 animals.

Although MIC2 has recently been reported in chloroma and rare terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-positive acute myelogenous leukemia (AML), the incidence and the significance of MIC2 (CD99) immunoreactivity in myeloid lesions is not clear. In this study, we evaluated MIC2 positivity in a variety of myeloid diseases and normal marrow to determine its incidence and distribution in myeloid diseases; its correlation with flow cytometric and cytogenetic data in AML; and its association with leukemic transformation, relapse, and chloroma formation. Paraffin sections of 11 chloromas and 94 bone marrow core biopsies from 66 patients were stained with CD99 monoclonal antibody 12E7. Of 94 bone marrow core biopsies, there were 30 AML (fragment antigen binding M0 to M6), 23 remissions, 5 relapses, 12 myeloproliferative disorders, 13 myelodysplastic syndromes, and 11 normal marrows from patients who did not have leukemia. CD99 immunoreactivity was evaluated with light microscopy. MIC2 expression was seen in leukemic blasts in 6 of 11 chloromas (55%) and 13 of 30 AML (43%) but rarely in myeloproliferative disorders, myelodysplastic syndromes, remission, and normal marrow. CD99 tended to be positive in M1-, M3-, and HLA-Dr-negative AML and negative in AML with relapse. MIC2 expression did not correlate with the karyotype independent of French-American-British Cooperative Group classification and the disease remission or occurrence of chloroma in AML. We concluded that MIC2 is commonly expressed in leukemic blasts of AML and is not predictive of leukemic transformation from myeloproliferative disorders and myelodysplastic syndromes or chloroma formation. Caution should be taken when using MIC2 as a marker for Ewing's sarcoma/ primitive neuroectodermal tumor or lymphoblastic lymphoma on paraffin sections of either soft tissue or bone marrow specimens.","['Zhang, P J', 'Barcos, M', 'Stewart, C C', 'Block, A W', 'Sait, S', 'Brooks, J J']","['Zhang PJ', 'Barcos M', 'Stewart CC', 'Block AW', 'Sait S', 'Brooks JJ']","['Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, University of Pennsylvania Medical Center, Philadelphia 19104-4283, USA. pjz@mail.med.upenn.edu']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Mod Pathol,"Modern pathology : an official journal of the United States and Canadian Academy of Pathology, Inc",8806605,IM,"['12E7 Antigen', 'Acute Disease', 'Antigens, CD/*analysis', 'Bone Marrow/chemistry/pathology', 'Cell Adhesion Molecules/*analysis', 'Cytogenetic Analysis', 'Flow Cytometry', 'HLA-DR Antigens/analysis', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/*metabolism/pathology']",2000/04/29 09:00,2000/07/06 11:00,['2000/04/29 09:00'],"['2000/04/29 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/07/06 11:00 [medline]', '2000/04/29 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/modpathol.3880077 [doi]'],ppublish,Mod Pathol. 2000 Apr;13(4):452-8. doi: 10.1038/modpathol.3880077.,"['0 (12E7 Antigen)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (CD99 protein, human)', '0 (Cell Adhesion Molecules)', '0 (HLA-DR Antigens)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Patients with this type of leukemia traditionally have been treated with a standard myeloid protocol, with a wide variation in prognosis between M6a, which has a similar prognosis to acute myelogenous leukemias, and M6b, with an extremely poor outcome despite aggressive therapy. Forty-eight archival cases of acute erythroleukemia, subtypes M6a (the traditional FAB-M6), M6b (pure erythroleukemia), and M6c (>30% myeloblasts and >30% pronormoblasts by FAB exclusion criteria), were evaluated for multidrug resistance gene (MDR-1) status. Findings were correlated with clinical course and karyotypes. Immunohistochemical stain for the protein product of MDR-1, P-glycoprotein, was variably positive in 11 of 23 patients with M6a, as well as in all of the patients with M6b (strongly positive) and M6c (weakly positive). P-glycoprotein expression positively correlated with unfavorable cytogenetic aberrations, poor response to chemotherapeutic agents, and short survival. Most significant was that P-glycoprotein expression demonstrated a negative additive effect on response to treatment and prognosis with unfavorable cytogenetic anomalies. P-glycoprotein expression and multiple cytogenetic anomalies most probably contribute to the resistance to chemotherapy and poor survival characteristic of the patients with M6b (mean survival, 3.15 +/- 4.2 mo) and M6c (mean survival, 10.5 +/- 12.7 mo). Because patients with M6b and M6c have increased numbers of pronormoblasts in their bone marrow and past chemotherapeutic attempts have failed, chemotherapy directed at these cells is appropriate.

Studies on overexpression of Trx and TrxR in human cancers have indicated a role of these proteins in tumor development. In this study, we analyzed the expression of TrxR in peripheral blood cells, tumor-transformed leukemia, and melanoma cells and found, in addition to abundant plasma membrane localization, that TrxR was released from these cells. Secretory cells were observed at the single cell level using a sensitive enzyme-linked immunospot assay. The release was inducible, and physiological stimulation of human monocytes by IFN-gamma, lipopolysaccharide, and interleukin 1alpha significantly increased the number of TrxR-secreting cells (P = 0.004). Secretion of TrxR followed the classical Golgi pathway, and it was confirmed by metabolic labeling using [35S]methionine and [35S]cysteine. TrxR was also detected for the first time in fresh healthy blood donor plasma (n = 21; median concentration, 18.0 ng/ml), with biological activity as determined by insulin reduction assay. These results highlight the role of extracellular Trx and TrxR during inflammation and tumor progression. Released Trx, with its active site motif containing amino acids Cys-X-X-Cys, was recently shown to have chemoattractant properties beside its previously described antioxidant and cocytokine activities. Regeneration of oxidized Trx requires available TrxR outside the cell, the presence and induction of which is described in this paper for normal and transformed cells.","['Soderberg, A', 'Sahaf, B', 'Rosen, A']","['Soderberg A', 'Sahaf B', 'Rosen A']","['Department of Biomedicine and Surgery, University of Linkoping, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,IM,"['Amino Acid Motifs', 'Animals', 'Cell Membrane/enzymology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Golgi Apparatus/drug effects/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Insulin/metabolism', 'Interferon-gamma/pharmacology', 'Interleukin-1/pharmacology', 'Leukemia/*enzymology/metabolism/pathology', 'Lipopolysaccharides/pharmacology', 'Melanoma/*enzymology/pathology', 'Mice', 'Monocytes/cytology/drug effects/*enzymology', 'Oxidation-Reduction', 'Proteins/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism', 'Selenoproteins', 'Sodium Selenite/pharmacology', 'Thioredoxin-Disulfide Reductase/*blood/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Thioredoxins/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2000/04/29 09:00,2000/05/16 09:00,['2000/04/29 09:00'],"['2000/04/29 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/05/16 09:00 [medline]', '2000/04/29 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 2000 Apr 15;60(8):2281-9.,"['0 (Insulin)', '0 (Interleukin-1)', '0 (Lipopolysaccharides)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '0 (Selenoproteins)', '52500-60-4 (Thioredoxins)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)', 'EC 1.8.1.9 (Thioredoxin-Disulfide Reductase)', 'HIW548RQ3W (Sodium Selenite)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In contrast to hChk1, the hChk2 kinase was 100-fold more resistant to inhibition by UCN-01 (IC50, 1040 nM). These results suggest that disruption of the DNA damage-induced G2 checkpoint by UCN-01 is mediated through the inhibition of the Cdc25C kinases, hChk1 and cTAK1, and that hChk2 activity is not sufficient to enforce the G2 checkpoint in cells treated with a pharmacological inhibitor of hChk1.","['Busby, E C', 'Leistritz, D F', 'Abraham, R T', 'Karnitz, L M', 'Sarkaria, J N']","['Busby EC', 'Leistritz DF', 'Abraham RT', 'Karnitz LM', 'Sarkaria JN']","['Division of Oncology Research, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota 55905, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,IM,"['Alkaloids/*pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Cell Cycle Proteins/*metabolism', 'Checkpoint Kinase 1', 'Checkpoint Kinase 2', 'DNA Damage/drug effects/genetics/radiation effects', 'G2 Phase/*drug effects/radiation effects', 'Humans', 'Inhibitory Concentration 50', 'K562 Cells', 'Models, Biological', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Phosphoserine/metabolism', '*Protein Kinase Inhibitors', 'Protein Kinases/metabolism', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Radiation-Sensitizing Agents/*pharmacology', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Staurosporine/analogs & derivatives', 'cdc25 Phosphatases/*metabolism']",2000/04/29 09:00,2000/05/16 09:00,['2000/04/29 09:00'],"['2000/04/29 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/05/16 09:00 [medline]', '2000/04/29 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 2000 Apr 15;60(8):2108-12.,"['0 (Alkaloids)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Radiation-Sensitizing Agents)', '17885-08-4 (Phosphoserine)', '7BU5H4V94A (7-hydroxystaurosporine)', 'EC 2.7.- (Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (MARK3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.1.11 (Checkpoint Kinase 2)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (CHEK1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (CHEK2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Checkpoint Kinase 1)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (CDC25C protein, human)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (cdc25 Phosphatases)', 'H88EPA0A3N (Staurosporine)']",,,,"['CA52995/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA69709/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA80829/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the human hematopoietic system, TCL1 expression is predominantly observed in developing B lymphocytes, whereas its overexpression in T cells causes mature T-cell proliferation in transgenic mice. In this study, using a newly generated monoclonal antibody against recombinant TCL1 protein, we extended our analysis mainly by immunohistochemistry and also by fluorescence-activated cell sorting and Western blot to a large tumor lymphoma data bank including 194 cases of lymphoproliferative disorders of B- and T-cell origin as well as reactive lymphoid tissues. The results obtained show that in reactive lymphoid tissues, TCL1 is strongly expressed by a subset of mantle zone B lymphocytes and is expressed to a lesser extent by follicle center cells and by scattered interfollicular small lymphocytes. In B-cell neoplasia, TCL1 was expressed in the majority of the cases, including lymphoblastic lymphoma, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, mantle cell lymphoma, follicular lymphoma, Burkitt lymphoma, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (60%), and primary cutaneous B cell lymphoma (55%). TCL1 expression was observed in both the cytoplasmic and nuclear compartments, as confirmed by Western blot analysis. Conversely, TCL1 was not expressed in Hodgkin/Reed-Sternberg cells, multiple myelomas, marginal zone B-cell lymphomas, CD30+ anaplastic large cell lymphoma, lymphoblastic T-cell lymphoma, peripheral T-cell lymphoma, and mycosis fungoides. These data indicate that TCL1 is expressed in more differentiated B cells, under both reactive and neoplastic conditions, from antigen committed B cells and in germinal center B cells and is down-regulated in the latest stage of B-cell differentiation.","['Narducci, M G', 'Pescarmona, E', 'Lazzeri, C', 'Signoretti, S', 'Lavinia, A M', 'Remotti, D', 'Scala, E', 'Baroni, C D', 'Stoppacciaro, A', 'Croce, C M', 'Russo, G']","['Narducci MG', 'Pescarmona E', 'Lazzeri C', 'Signoretti S', 'Lavinia AM', 'Remotti D', 'Scala E', 'Baroni CD', 'Stoppacciaro A', 'Croce CM', 'Russo G']","[""Istituto Dermopatico dell'Immacolata, Istituto di Ricovero e Cura a Carattere Scientifico, Rome, Italy.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,IM,"['Aged', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/immunology', 'Antibody Specificity/immunology', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Nucleus/metabolism', 'Cytoplasm/metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/immunology/*metabolism', 'Flow Cytometry', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Hodgkin Disease/metabolism/pathology', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/metabolism/pathology', 'Leukemia, Prolymphocytic/metabolism/pathology', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/metabolism', 'Lymphoid Tissue/metabolism/pathology', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Lymphoma, Large-Cell, Anaplastic/metabolism/pathology', 'Lymphoma, T-Cell/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', '*Proto-Oncogene Proteins', 'Pseudolymphoma/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/immunology/*metabolism']",2000/04/29 09:00,2000/05/16 09:00,['2000/04/29 09:00'],"['2000/04/29 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/05/16 09:00 [medline]', '2000/04/29 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 2000 Apr 15;60(8):2095-100.,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (TCL1A protein, human)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",,,,['D.102/Telethon/Italy'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Topotecan stabilizes the complex formed between topoisomerase I and DNA, leading to DNA strand breakage and cell death. In accordance with preclinical studies, clinical efficacy of topotecan was documented in ovarian carcinoma, in small cell lung cancer and in childhood solid tumors. Myelosuppression is the dose-limiting toxicity and nonhematologic side effects are generally mild. The activity of topotecan against a number of hematological malignancies is now increasingly exploited as well as its role in high-dose chemotherapy programs with stem cell support. In both lymphoblastic and myeloid acute leukemias, topotecan has been widely utilised both as single agent or associated to other cytostatic drugs with proven efficacy in these diseases. Most of the published phase II studies demonstrated that heavily pre-treated, relapsing patients achieve a high percentage of overall responses with manageable toxicity. In myelodisplastic syndromes and acute myelomonocitic leukemias a recently published study shows positive results for the combination of topotecan and cytarabin. Topotecan seems to preferentially affect the abnormal cytogenetic clones and in patients achieving a complete response, a conversion from an aneuploid to a diploid karyotipe was documented. In non-Hodgkin lymphomas, several schedules have been tested in the phase I setting. When utilized alone and at very low dosage, the drug yielded 15% of objective responses and a lack of extrahematologic toxicity. Of particular interest seems to be the association of topotecan with taxanes that needs to be supported by growth factors. In multiple myeloma Topotecan has been utilized as single agent in heavily pre-treated patients. The obtained results show good activity and again myelosuppression as preminent toxicity. The use of topotecan in high-dose chemotherapy regimens for multiple myeloma has been proposed. The utilization of topotecan in high-dose chemotherapy is one of the newer and more interesting applications. Solid tumors (i.e. ovarian cancer and small cell lung cancer) are actually investigated by many authors, who have indicated that this drug can be used preferentially as a part of diversified programs containing overlimit dosages of different cytostatics. Furthermore, topotecan demonstrated to be an effective drug to mobilize CD34+ cells for autografting. A general conclusion is that topotecan is an interesting addition to the actual chemotherapy scenario, both because of its mechanism of action and its toxicity profile. The present review of the new possibility of utilization, give us the idea that topotecan has activity in several hematologic neoplasias; further investigations in these diseases (i.e., induction treatment, combination chemotherapy) are then warranted. The broad spectrum of antitumor activity and the characteristics of toxicity make it also interesting for use in both the circulating progenitor cell mobilization and in the consolidation phase of high-dose chemotherapy programs.","['Ferrari, S', 'Danova, M']","['Ferrari S', 'Danova M']","['Universita e IRCCS Policlinico San Matteo, Pavia.']",['ita'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",United States,Tumori,Tumori,0111356,IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/adverse effects/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Mobilization', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/drug therapy', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/drug therapy', 'Multiple Myeloma/drug therapy', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/drug therapy', 'Topotecan/adverse effects/pharmacology/*therapeutic use']",2000/04/29 09:00,2000/05/20 09:00,['2000/04/29 09:00'],"['2000/04/29 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/05/20 09:00 [medline]', '2000/04/29 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Tumori. 1999 Nov-Dec;85(6 Suppl 1):S23-8.,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '7M7YKX2N15 (Topotecan)']",,,,,,,,Topotecan: i nuovi campi di utilizzo.,,,,,,,,,,,,

The biosynthesis of AEA, PEA, or 2-AG can be induced by stimulation with either Ca(2+) ionophores, lipopolysaccharide, or platelet activating factor in macrophages, and by ionomycin or antigen challenge in rat basophilic leukemia (RBL-2H3) cells (a widely used model for mast cells). These cells also inactivate CFADs through re-uptake and/or hydrolysis and/or esterification processes. AEA and PEA modulate cytokine and/or arachidonate release from macrophages in vitro, regulate serotonin secretion from RBL-2H3 cells, and are analgesic in some animal models of inflammatory pain. However, the involvement of endogenous CFADs and cannabinoid CB(1) and CB(2) receptors in these effects is still controversial. In human breast and prostate cancer cells, AEA and 2-AG, but not PEA, potently inhibit prolactin and/or nerve growth factor (NGF)-induced cell proliferation. Vanillyl-derivatives of anandamide, such as olvanil and arvanil, exhibit even higher anti-proliferative activity.

The aim of the study was to compare the in vitro results of six cytostatic drugs to the clinical outcome in 83 acute non-lymphocytic leukemia (ANLL) patients. The secondary ANLL at diagnosis showed an in vitro resistance to daunorubicin that was significantly higher compared to de novo ANLL at diagnosis (P<0.003). De novo ANLL at diagnosis that achieved complete remission (CR) were significantly more sensitive to daunorubicin compared to those who didn't achieve CR (P<0.05). There was an vitro correlation between topoisomerase II active drugs but not between these drugs and ara-C. In vitro ara-C sensitivity (< or = the median of the de novo ANLL at diagnosis) was correlated to poor overall survival (P = 0.02). In vitro sensitivity to daunorubicin and mitoxantrone was associated with prolonged disease free survival (P = 0.03 and P = 0.04).

Blood or bone marrow samples from patients with acute myelogenous leukemia (AML), acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and mixed leukemia were examined qualitatively and quantitatively for the expression of Fas as well as its function using flow cytometry and the annexin V staining method. Fas expression was flow cytometrically unimodal with heterogeneous density, and showed quantitatively characteristic features in different diseases: undetectable in mixed leukemia, faint to weak in ALL, low in M0 and M1, and variable (low to strong) in M2, M3, M4, and M5. Both the full-length and the alternatively spliced truncated mRNAs were detected constitutively even in acute leukemia cells with qualitatively negative and quantitatively faint Fas, and the band density of the former transcripts detected by RT-PCR was correlated with the level of expression of the Fas protein. Short-term culturing of freshly isolated leukemia cells gave rise to an increase of Fas density. In acute leukemia cells, the apoptosis induced by anti-Fas MoAb was compared with that induced by etoposide (a topoisomerase II inhibitor). We found that fresh ALL and AML cells were resistant to the anti-Fas IgM antibody, while etoposide could trigger apoptosis in all types of leukemia tested. The combined effects of the anti-Fas MoAb and etoposide were not always synergistic. These results suggest that Fas is a biological marker for characterizing ALL and AML cells, and provide insight into creating a new therapeutic modality using cytotoxic drugs and cytokines together with modulation of Fas.","['Li, Q', 'Tsuruda, K', 'Sugahara, K', 'Dateki, N', 'Ohishi, E', 'Yamada, Y', 'Tomonaga, M', 'Moriuchi, H', 'Tsuji, Y', 'Kamihira, S']","['Li Q', 'Tsuruda K', 'Sugahara K', 'Dateki N', 'Ohishi E', 'Yamada Y', 'Tomonaga M', 'Moriuchi H', 'Tsuji Y', 'Kamihira S']","['Department of Laboratory Medicine, Nagasaki University School of Medicine, 1-7-1 Sakamoto, Nagasaki City, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,IM,"['Acute Disease', '*Apoptosis', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*immunology/*pathology', 'fas Receptor/biosynthesis/*immunology']",2000/04/28 09:00,2000/06/24 11:00,['2000/04/28 09:00'],"['2000/04/28 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/06/24 11:00 [medline]', '2000/04/28 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0145-2126(99)00203-9 [pii]', '10.1016/s0145-2126(99)00203-9 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 2000 May;24(5):437-44. doi: 10.1016/s0145-2126(99)00203-9.,['0 (fas Receptor)'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To further evaluate this putative correlation, we assessed the c-mpl mRNA expression in blast samples of 53 AML patients. Overall, c-mpl mRNA expression was observed in 27 (51%) patients. No significant difference between c-mpl(+) and c-mpl(-) patients was found with respect to established prognostic factors such as age (50 vs. 53 years) or karyotype, whereas a significant correlation was observed between c-mpl and CD34 expression (P = 0.026). Among 40 patients who completed standard-/high-dose cytarabine-containing induction/consolidation treatment and were evaluable for treatment response, a higher complete remission (CR) rate was achieved in c-mpl- than in c-mpl(+) patients (95 vs. 68%; P = 0.026). Upon multivariate analysis, this relationship was independent from CD34 expression. CR duration was not significantly longer in c-mpl(-) than in c-mpl(+) patients (median: 14 vs. 10 months, P = 0.262). In conclusion, our data strongly support the previously suggested notion that c-mpl expression is of prognostic relevance for CR induction in de novo AML patients, and suggest determination of c-mpl expression within larger prospective studies in the attempt to develop risk-adapted AML treatment strategies.","['Schroder, J K', 'Kolkenbrock, S', 'Tins, J', 'Kasimir-Bauer, S', 'Seeber, S', 'Schutte, J']","['Schroder JK', 'Kolkenbrock S', 'Tins J', 'Kasimir-Bauer S', 'Seeber S', 'Schutte J']","['Department of Internal Medicine (Cancer Research), University of Essen Medical School, Hufelandstr. 55, D-45122, Essen, Germany. jochen.schuette@uni-essen.de']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Aged', '*Biomarkers, Tumor', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/genetics/*metabolism/physiopathology', 'Middle Aged', '*Neoplasm Proteins', 'Prognosis', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*biosynthesis', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis', 'Receptors, Cytokine/metabolism', 'Receptors, Thrombopoietin', 'Survival Analysis', 'Thrombopoietin/metabolism']",2000/04/28 09:00,2000/06/24 11:00,['2000/04/28 09:00'],"['2000/04/28 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/06/24 11:00 [medline]', '2000/04/28 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0145-2126(99)00201-5 [pii]', '10.1016/s0145-2126(99)00201-5 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 2000 May;24(5):401-9. doi: 10.1016/s0145-2126(99)00201-5.,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Cytokine)', '0 (Receptors, Thrombopoietin)', '143641-95-6 (MPL protein, human)', '9014-42-0 (Thrombopoietin)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

J6-1 leukemic cell line spontaneously forms cell clusters, whose growth depends on the auto-juxtacrine mediated by m-M-CSF and its receptor (M-CSFR). In this study, M-CSFR isolated from J6-1 cells and recombinant human M-CSF soluble receptor (rh-M-CSFsR) were used to study their effects on J6-1 cells. Both receptors inhibited cell proliferation. Use of M-CSFR monoclonal antibodies, M-CSFR or rh-M-CSFsR to block either M-CSFR or m-M-CSF on cell surface inhibited the cluster forming process, while both receptors stimulated cells adhering to culture plate. Furthermore, M-CSFR and/or rh-M-CSFsR caused multiple cellular changes including cytoplasmic pH, multinuclear cell ratio, antigen expression and cell diameter. A [Ca(2+)] rise was induced within 90 s by both receptors. Western blot experiments showed that rh-M-CSFsR caused tyrosine phosphorylation on multiple cytoplasmic proteins of 45 kDa and 55-90 kDa, which could be blocked by H7. These observations suggested that m-M-CSF and M-CSFR mediate J6-1 cell intercellular adhesion with bi-directional signal transduction, and Ca(2+), protein tyrosine kinases, PKC and/or other H7 sensitive kinase(s) involve in the counter-directional signal transduction.","['Zheng, G', 'Rao, Q', 'Wu, K', 'He, Z', 'Geng, Y']","['Zheng G', 'Rao Q', 'Wu K', 'He Z', 'Geng Y']","['National Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College (CAMS & PUMC), Tianjin, PR China. zhengggtj@hotmail.com']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,IM,"['Cell Adhesion', 'Cell Adhesion Molecules/metabolism', 'Cell Communication', 'Cell Membrane/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*metabolism/*pathology', 'Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/*metabolism', 'Receptor, Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2000/04/28 09:00,2000/06/24 11:00,['2000/04/28 09:00'],"['2000/04/28 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/06/24 11:00 [medline]', '2000/04/28 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0145-2126(99)00192-7 [pii]', '10.1016/s0145-2126(99)00192-7 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 2000 May;24(5):375-83. doi: 10.1016/s0145-2126(99)00192-7.,"['0 (Cell Adhesion Molecules)', '81627-83-0 (Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor, Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We sought to identify cytogenetic features that would predict differences in outcome within this low-risk subset of ALL patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: High-hyperdiploid ALL patients (N = 480) were enrolled between 1988 and 1995 on Children's Cancer Group (CCG) trials. Karyotypes were determined by conventional banding. Treatment outcome was analyzed by life-table methods. RESULTS: Patients with 54 to 58 chromosomes had better outcome than patients with 51 to 53 or 59 to 68 chromosomes (P = .0002). Patients with a trisomy of chromosome 10 (P<.0001), chromosome 17 (P = .0002), or chromosome 18 (P = .004) had significantly improved outcome compared with their counterparts who lacked the given trisomy. Patients with a trisomy of chromosome 5 had worse outcome than patients lacking this trisomy (P = .02). Patients with trisomies of both chromosomes 10 and 17 had better outcome than those with a trisomy of chromosome 10 (P = .09), a trisomy of chromosome 17 (P =.01), or neither trisomy (P<.0001). Multivariate analysis indicated that trisomy of chromosome 10 (P = .001) was the most significant prognostic factor for high-hyperdiploid patients, yet trisomy of chromosome 17 (P =.02) or chromosome 5 (P = .01) and modal chromosome number (P = .02) also had significant multivariate effects. CONCLUSION: Trisomy of chromosomes 10 and 17 as well as modal chromosome number 54 to 58 identify subgroups of patients with high-hyperdiploid ALL who have a better outcome than high-hyperdiploid patients who lack these cytogenetic features. Trisomy of chromosome 5 confers poorer outcome among high-hyperdiploid patients.","['Heerema, N A', 'Sather, H N', 'Sensel, M G', 'Zhang, T', 'Hutchinson, R J', 'Nachman, J B', 'Lange, B J', 'Steinherz, P G', 'Bostrom, B C', 'Reaman, G H', 'Gaynon, P S', 'Uckun, F M']","['Heerema NA', 'Sather HN', 'Sensel MG', 'Zhang T', 'Hutchinson RJ', 'Nachman JB', 'Lange BJ', 'Steinherz PG', 'Bostrom BC', 'Reaman GH', 'Gaynon PS', 'Uckun FM']","[""Department of Genetics, Hughes Institute, and Children's Cancer Group Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia Biology Reference Laboratory, St. Paul. nheerema@ih.org""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,IM,"['Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 10/*genetics', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 17/*genetics', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 5/*genetics', '*Diploidy', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Karyotyping', 'Male', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics/pathology', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'Prognosis', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Trisomy/*genetics']",2000/04/28 09:00,2000/06/10 09:00,['2000/04/28 09:00'],"['2000/04/28 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/06/10 09:00 [medline]', '2000/04/28 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1200/JCO.2000.18.9.1876 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2000 May;18(9):1876-87. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2000.18.9.1876.,,,,,"['CA-13539/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-60437/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: MEC therapy consisted of mitoxantrone 6 mg/m(2)/d for 5 days, etoposide 60 mg/m(2)/d for 5 days, and CSA 10 mg/kg for 2 hours followed by 30 mg/kg/d as a continuous infusion for 98 hours. Because of pharmacokinetic interactions, drug doses were decreased to 60% of those found to be effective without coadministration of CSA. MDR1 expression was evaluated by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction, flow cytometry, and the ability of CSA at 2.5 micromol/L to increase intracellular accumulation of (3)H-daunomycin in blasts from bone marrow specimens. RESULTS: The remission rate was 35% (n = 23 of 66). Overall, 35% of patients (n = 23) achieved complete remission (CR), 12% of patients (n = 8) achieved partial remission, and 9% of patients (n = 6) died of infection. Exposure to CSA levels of greater than 2,400 ng/mL was achieved in 95% of patients (n = 56 of 59). Toxicities included infection, cardiotoxicity, myelosuppression, stomatitis, and reversible increases in serum creatinine and bilirubin. In most who had relapsed while receiving therapy or whose induction therapy had failed, response was not significantly different for MDR1-positive and MDR1-negative patients. CONCLUSION: Serum levels of CSA capable of reversing multidrug resistance are achievable in children with acceptable toxicity. The CR rate of 35% achieved in this study is comparable to previously reported results using standard doses of mitoxantrone and etoposide. The use of CSA may have improved the response rate for the MDR1-positive patients so that it was not different from that for the MDR1-negative patients.","['Dahl, G V', 'Lacayo, N J', 'Brophy, N', 'Dunussi-Joannopoulos, K', 'Weinstein, H J', 'Chang, M', 'Sikic, B I', 'Arceci, R J']","['Dahl GV', 'Lacayo NJ', 'Brophy N', 'Dunussi-Joannopoulos K', 'Weinstein HJ', 'Chang M', 'Sikic BI', 'Arceci RJ']","['Division of Pediatric Oncology, Medical Oncology, and Clinical Pharmacology, Stanford University School of Medicine, Palo Alto, USA.

In this report we sought to determine pretransplantation factors that might predict outcome. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Of 67 such patients, 43 had acute lymphocytic leukemia and 24 had acute myelogenous leukemia. At the time of transplantation, 41 patients were in relapse. Donors included 40 parents, 24 siblings, and three cousins. HLA disparity of two to three major antigens was detected in two thirds of the donor-recipient pairs. Conditioning therapy, including total-body irradiation and chemotherapy followed by graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) prophylaxis with partial T-cell depletion of the graft using T10B9 or OKT3, was combined with posttransplantation immunosuppression. RESULTS: Estimated probability (EP) of engraftment was 0.96 and was not affected by donor-antigen mismatch (AgMM; P =.732). EP of grades 2 to 4 acute GvHD was 0.24 and was not affected by recipient AgMM (P =.796). EP of disease-free survival was 0.26 at 3 years but improved to 0.45 when donors were younger than 30 years (P<.001). EP of relapse at 3 years was 0.41 and reduced with younger donors' age. For patients who were in relapse at the time of transplantation, absence of blasts was associated with a lower relapse rate (0.46 v. 0.84; P =. 083), similar to that of patients in remission. CONCLUSION: PMRD-BMT in pediatric leukemia resulted in high engraftment and low GvHD rates.

This study was intended to ascertain the population incidence and rate (infections per 100 patient-days of treatment) of AHS and to identify associated risk factors. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients (n = 874 with 151,350 days of risk) enrolled on the Children's Cancer Group (CCG) protocol for newly diagnosed AML, CCG-2891, which randomly assigned intensity of induction and intensification, were prospectively evaluated for infectious complications. RESULTS: AHS occurred in 21% of patients, was primarily blood borne (86%), made up 21% of bacteremic infections, and had a recurrent incidence of 31% during subsequent therapy. AHS was more often life-threatening (59%) than other infections (41%) (P = .001). AHS rates increased with age less than 10 years (odds ratio [OR], 2.0; P = .007), intensively timed induction (OR, 1.8 to 1.9; P = .02), and high-dose cytarabine intensification (OR, 3.7; P<.0001). Among all courses, the greatest incidence (19%) and rate (0.41) were associated with the use of high-dose cytarabine. Gastrointestinal toxicity correlated significantly with AHS bacteremia (P<.01). Infection with AHS resulted in increased hospital days (P =.0001). Only among bone marrow transplant patients were overall survival (OR, 2.8; P = .0001) and disease-free survival (OR, 2.1; P = .008) decreased after AHS bacteremia. CONCLUSION: This study, the first to prospectively examine AHS incidence among uniformly treated patients in multiple institutions, established that as the intensity of AML therapy has increased, so has the rate of AHS. Young children, those with previous AHS bacteremias, and those receiving high-dose cytarabine are at particularly high risk of AHS bacteremia.","['Gamis, A S', 'Howells, W B', 'DeSwarte-Wallace, J', 'Feusner, J H', 'Buckley, J D', 'Woods, W G']","['Gamis AS', 'Howells WB', 'DeSwarte-Wallace J', 'Feusner JH', 'Buckley JD', 'Woods WG']","[""Children's Mercy Hospital, Kansas City, MO, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Hemolysis', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/complications/*drug therapy/microbiology', 'Male', 'Prospective Studies', 'Risk Factors', 'Streptococcal Infections/*epidemiology/etiology']",2000/04/28 09:00,2000/06/10 09:00,['2000/04/28 09:00'],"['2000/04/28 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/06/10 09:00 [medline]', '2000/04/28 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1200/JCO.2000.18.9.1845 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2000 May;18(9):1845-55. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2000.18.9.1845.,,,,,"['CA 02971/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 13539/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 17829/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Ten patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) were included. Leukemic cells from seven of the patients were P-glycoprotein (Pgp)-positive. dnr 100 mg/m(2) was given as a continuous infusion over 72 hours. After 24 hours, a loading dose of valspodar was given, followed by a 36-hour infusion of 10 mg/kg per 24 hours. Blood samples were drawn at regular intervals, and concentrations of dnr and its main metabolite, daunorubicinol, in plasma and isolated leukemic cells were determined by high-pressure liquid chromatography. RESULTS: The mean dnr concentrations in leukemic cells 24 hours after the start of infusion (before valspodar) were 18.8 micromol/L in Pgp-negative samples and 13.5 micromol/L in Pgp-positive samples. After 8 hours of valspodar infusion, these values were 25.8 and 24.0 micromol/L, respectively. The effect of valspodar was evaluated from the ratio of the area under the curve (AUC) for dnr concentration versus time in leukemic cells to the AUC for dnr concentration against time in the plasma. For the seven patients with Pgp-positive leukemia, the mean ratio increased by 52%, from 545 on day 1 to 830 on day 2 (P<.05) when valspodar was given. In the three patients with Pgp-negative leukemia, no significant difference was observed. CONCLUSION: These results strongly suggest that valspodar, by interacting with Pgp, can increase the cellular uptake of dnr in leukemic blasts in vivo.","['Tidefelt, U', 'Liliemark, J', 'Gruber, A', 'Liliemark, E', 'Sundman-Engberg, B', 'Juliusson, G', 'Stenke, L', 'Elmhorn-Rosenborg, A', 'Mollgard, L', 'Lehman, S', 'Xu, D', 'Covelli, A', 'Gustavsson, B', 'Paul, C']","['Tidefelt U', 'Liliemark J', 'Gruber A', 'Liliemark E', 'Sundman-Engberg B', 'Juliusson G', 'Stenke L', 'Elmhorn-Rosenborg A', 'Mollgard L', 'Lehman S', 'Xu D', 'Covelli A', 'Gustavsson B', 'Paul C']","['Department of Hematology, Orebro Medical Center Hospital, Orebro, Sweden. ulf.tidefelt@orebroll.se']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/*metabolism', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/*pharmacokinetics', 'Cyclosporins/*pharmacology', 'Daunorubicin/*pharmacokinetics', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Interactions', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Male', 'Middle Aged']",2000/04/28 09:00,2000/06/10 09:00,['2000/04/28 09:00'],"['2000/04/28 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/06/10 09:00 [medline]', '2000/04/28 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1200/JCO.2000.18.9.1837 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2000 May;18(9):1837-44. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2000.18.9.1837.,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Cyclosporins)', 'Q7ZP55KF3X (valspodar)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The purpose of this study was to improve the detection of a low frequency of Ph+ cells. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We combined fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) with long-term colcemid exposure, capturing several hundred metaphases in bone marrow cultures (hypermetaphase FISH [HMF]). Using probes that identify Ph+ cells, HMF was compared with CG analysis in the follow-up evaluations of 51 patients with CML at various time points after allogeneic bone marrow transplant (BMT). RESULTS: Thirty-five patients never showed the presence of Ph+ cells by either method. In four patients, high frequencies of Ph+ cells were detected by both methods. In the remaining 12 patients, Ph+ cells were detected by HMF at time points after BMT when they were not detected by CG. In seven of the 12 patients, low but statistically significant frequencies of Ph+ cells (0.37% to 5.20%) were detected 3 months or later after BMT, and when no intervention was initiated, all seven patients later relapsed. Based on those data, an eighth patient with mixed chimerism and a similar HMF-detected Ph+ frequency (1.8% at 27 months after BMT) was reinfused with donor lymphocytes and achieved remission with 0% Ph+ cells studied by HMF (up to 50 months after BMT). Ph+ cells detected by HMF but not by CG less than 3 months after BMT disappeared on later examination in two of four patients. After detection of Ph+ cells by HMF only, the median time to cytogenetic progression (detection of Ph+ cells by CG) was 101 days. CONCLUSION: The results demonstrate the ability of HMF to detect low but clinically relevant levels of leukemic cells not detected by CG in transplant patients. The data indicate that HMF can detect low levels of Ph+ cells before standard cytogenetics at a time that may be useful in monitoring disease status and planning clinical interventions.","['Seong, C M', 'Giralt, S', 'Kantarjian, H', 'Xu, J', 'Swantkowski, J', 'Hayes, K', 'Glassman, A B', 'Khouri, I', 'Korbling, M', 'Thall, P', 'Siciliano, M J', 'Champlin, R E']","['Seong CM', 'Giralt S', 'Kantarjian H', 'Xu J', 'Swantkowski J', 'Hayes K', 'Glassman AB', 'Khouri I', 'Korbling M', 'Thall P', 'Siciliano MJ', 'Champlin RE']","['Department of Blood and Marrow Transplantation, Leukemia, Molecular Genetics, Laboratory Medicine, University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas 77030, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,IM,"['*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'False Negative Reactions', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*genetics/*pathology/therapy', 'Metaphase/genetics', '*Philadelphia Chromosome', 'Recurrence', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",2000/04/28 09:00,2000/06/10 09:00,['2000/04/28 09:00'],"['2000/04/28 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/06/10 09:00 [medline]', '2000/04/28 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1200/JCO.2000.18.9.1831 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2000 May;18(9):1831-6. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2000.18.9.1831.,,,,,"['CA43936/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA49639/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA55164/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A 73 year old woman with chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia had been followed up for one year when unexplained fever occurred.

In contrast, little is known about the physiology and genic structure of this unique enzyme. In some diseases, like hairy cell leukemia, Gaucher's disease and osteoclastoma, cytochemically detected TRAP expression is used as a disease-associated marker. In order to begin to elucidate the regulation of this gene we generated different deletion constructs of the TRAP 5'-flanking region, placed them upstream of the luciferase reporter gene and assayed them for their ability to direct luciferase expression in human 293 cells. Treatment of these cells with the iron-modulating reagents transferrin and hemin causes opposite effects on the TRAP promoter activity. Two regulatory GAGGC tandem repeat sequences (the hemin responsive elements, HRE) within the 5'-flanking region of the human TRAP gene were identified. Studies with specific HRE-deletion constructs of the human TRAP 5'-flanking region upstream of the luciferase reporter gene document the functionality of these HRE-sequences which are apparently responsible for mediating transcriptional inhibition upon exposure to hemin. In addition to the previously published functional characterization of the murine TRAP HRE motifs, these results provide the first description of a new iron/hemin-responsive transcriptional regulation in the human TRAP gene.","['Fleckenstein, E C', 'Dirks, W G', 'Drexler, H G']","['Fleckenstein EC', 'Dirks WG', 'Drexler HG']",['DSMZ-German Collection of Microorganisms and Cell Cultures Department of Human and Animal Cell Cultures Braunschweig.'],['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,IM,"['Acid Phosphatase/*genetics/metabolism', 'Cell Line', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic', 'Hemin/*genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Tartrates', 'Transcription, Genetic']",2000/04/28 09:00,2000/06/17 09:00,['2000/04/28 09:00'],"['2000/04/28 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/06/17 09:00 [medline]', '2000/04/28 09:00 [entrez]']","['I308J991162 [pii]', '10.3109/10428190009148409 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2000 Feb;36(5-6):603-12. doi: 10.3109/10428190009148409.,"['0 (Tartrates)', '743LRP9S7N (Hemin)', 'EC 3.1.3.2 (Acid Phosphatase)', 'W4888I119H (tartaric acid)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Furthermore, activation of the induced trkA receptor by exogenous NGF potentiated the differentiating effects of RA and NaBut.

Aberrant TSG101 transcript have been identified in many types of cancers, and the relaxation of RNA splicing fidelity may be an onco-developmental marker in cancers and could play a general role in tumorigenesis. In our previous study, smaller TSG101 transcripts were found in AML specimens, hematopoietic cell lines and normal controls. The aberrant transcripts occurred more frequently in the AML cases and cell lines. The patients with aberrant TSG101 transcripts had higher initial white cell count, lower LDH level, and lower complete remission rate after induction chemotherapy. However, further multivariate analysis of clinical data revealed that there was no relationship to the TSG101 aberrant transcripts. The clinical significance of TSG101 aberrant transcript in AML needs further evaluation.","['Lin, S F', 'Lin, P M', 'Liu, T C', 'Chang, J G', 'Sue, Y C', 'Chen, T P']","['Lin SF', 'Lin PM', 'Liu TC', 'Chang JG', 'Sue YC', 'Chen TP']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Kaohsiung Medical University Hospital, Taiwan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,IM,"['3T3 Cells', 'Animals', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/*genetics', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics', 'Endosomal Sorting Complexes Required for Transport', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/etiology/*genetics/pathology', 'Mice', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics', 'Transcription, Genetic']",2000/04/28 09:00,2000/06/17 09:00,['2000/04/28 09:00'],"['2000/04/28 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/06/17 09:00 [medline]', '2000/04/28 09:00 [entrez]']","['I308J991147 [pii]', '10.3109/10428190009148393 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2000 Feb;36(5-6):463-6. doi: 10.3109/10428190009148393.,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Endosomal Sorting Complexes Required for Transport)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tsg101 protein)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Leptin stimulates normal myeloid and erythroid development, and is secreted from bone marrow adipocytes, which occupy most of the marrow cavity in humans. Leptin might thus play an important role in the control of the expansion and differentiation of primitive hematopoietic cells through paracrine interaction in the bone marrow microenvironment. Leukemic cells of some patients with acute myeloblastic leukemia, acute lymphoblastic leukemia, and chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) also express the leptin receptor. In cases of CML, higher expression of leptin receptor is observed during blast crisis than in chronic phase. Leptin alone and in combination with other cytokines has stimulative effects on proliferation of leukemia cells as well as anti-apoptotic effects.

The effect and mechanism of FL on the development of the megakaryocytic lineage remain unclear. In this study, we compared the effects of FL and stem cell factor (SCF) in combination with other megakaryocyte-promoting cytokines on the differentiation and proliferation of megakaryocytic progenitors and investigated the expression of flt-3 receptors on megakaryocytic cell lines. In liquid cultures of enriched CD34+ cells from human umbilical cord blood for 14 days, FL plus thrombopoietin (TPO), interleukin-3 (IL-3), and IL-6 promoted the expansion of nucleated cells, CD34+ cells, CD34+ CD38- cells, and megakaryocyte colony-forming units (CFU-MK) by 300 +/- 115-, 23.8 +/- 11.3-, 33.9 +/- 28.6-, and 584 +/- 220-fold, respectively. Replacing FL with SCF significantly decreased the yield of all cell types. Using murine bone marrow (BM) cells, we demonstrated that FL at a range of 0-100 ng/ml had no significant mitogenic effect on CFU-MK formation. TPO increased CFU-MK (p < 0.001) but the effect was not significantly modified by FL. While one human acute lymphoblastic leukemia sample expressed high levels of flt-3 receptor, the four megakaryocytic cell lines (Meg-01, CHRF-288-11, M-07e, and Dami) did not show any positive expression. Our data suggest that the present cytokine combination and expansion conditions provide an effective and potentially useful system for the clinical expansion of cord blood for bone marrow transplantation (BMT). FL alone did not stimulate megakaryocytopoiesis, possibly due to the lack of receptor expression on megakaryocytes. The effect of FL in augmenting the expansion of CFU-MK in liquid culture might be due to the early action of FL at the pluripotent stem cell stage.","['Li, K', 'Yang, M', 'Lam, A C', 'Yau, F W', 'Yuen, P M']","['Li K', 'Yang M', 'Lam AC', 'Yau FW', 'Yuen PM']","['Department of Paediatrics, Prince of Wales Hospital, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shatin, NT. lipang@cuhk.edu.hk']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cell Transplant,Cell transplantation,9208854,IM,"['Adjuvants, Immunologic/*pharmacology', 'Antigens, CD34/analysis', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Graft Survival/drug effects', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-3/pharmacology', 'Interleukin-6/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive', 'Megakaryocytes/chemistry/cytology/*transplantation', 'Membrane Proteins/*pharmacology', 'Stem Cell Factor/pharmacology', 'Thrombopoietin/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2000/04/28 09:00,2000/06/24 11:00,['2000/04/28 09:00'],"['2000/04/28 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/06/24 11:00 [medline]', '2000/04/28 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1177/096368970000900115 [doi]'],ppublish,Cell Transplant. 2000 Jan-Feb;9(1):125-31. doi: 10.1177/096368970000900115.,"['0 (Adjuvants, Immunologic)', '0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Interleukin-3)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Stem Cell Factor)', '0 (flt3 ligand protein)', '9014-42-0 (Thrombopoietin)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A high plasma peak seems to correlate with the liberation of oxygen radicals and cumulative delayed cardiotoxicity, and therefore, should be avoided. On the other hand, its role in attaining the desired therapeutic effect, i.e. induction of apoptosis in tumor cells, has not been clearly elucidated. METHODS: Idarubicin is the only anthracycline that can be applied orally. We measured the DNA-binding of idarubicin and idarubicinol and the induced apoptosis in the human promyelocytic HL-60 leukemia cell line. Various pharmacokinetic profiles, with and without clinically relevant peak concentrations, were simulated in vitro. RESULTS: The concentration necessary for maximal DNA-binding and subsequent induction of apoptosis was 1.5 microg/ml for 20 minutes which is well above the plasma concentration achievable in therapy. A plateau of apoptosis was observed after 90 minutes of incubation; a prolongation above 90 minutes did not increase the rate of apoptosis. We simulated a bolus application and a continuous infusion using two different pharmacokinetic profiles of idarubicin with comparable AUCs (area under the time curve). After 48 hours of total incubation, the viability of HL-60 cells was 56.88% with profile 1 (50 ng/ml idarubicin for 2 hours) and 83.00% with profile 2 (4.25 ng/ml for 24 hours). CONCLUSIONS: Although these in vitro experiments are not directly applicable to the clinical situation, they do indicate that a prolongation of the application time up to at least 90 minutes, either by continuous infusion or by oral application, may be acceptable as a method of increasing apoptosis. On the other hand, the plasma peak seems to be an important factor for the induction of apoptosis. Further studies are in progress to define the minimal plasma peak necessary to induce a maximum of apoptosis.","['Gieseler, F', 'Clark, M', 'Stiebeling, K', 'Puschmann, M', 'Valsamas, S']","['Gieseler F', 'Clark M', 'Stiebeling K', 'Puschmann M', 'Valsamas S']","['Schwerpunkt Hamatologie/Onkologie, Klinik fur Allgemeine Innere Medizin, Christian-Albrechts-Universitat, Kiel, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Int J Clin Pharmacol Ther,International journal of clinical pharmacology and therapeutics,9423309,IM,"['Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/blood/*pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Agents/blood/*pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use', '*Apoptosis', 'Area Under Curve', 'DNA, Neoplasm/metabolism', 'Daunorubicin/analogs & derivatives/blood/pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use', 'HL-60 Cells/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Idarubicin/blood/*pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/drug therapy/pathology']",2000/04/28 09:00,2000/07/06 11:00,['2000/04/28 09:00'],"['2000/04/28 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/07/06 11:00 [medline]', '2000/04/28 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.5414/cpp38217 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Clin Pharmacol Ther. 2000 Apr;38(4):217-21. doi: 10.5414/cpp38217.,"['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '86189-66-4 (idarubicinol)', 'ZRP63D75JW (Idarubicin)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Furthermore, we extended the antisense method to the use of AS-ODNs in the parental drug-sensitive leukemia cells which express mdr1-mRNA at a relative low level and lack P170 expression to evaluate the effectiveness of prophylactic AS-ODN treatment. METHODS: The effect of a 4-day AS-ODN treatment in drug-resistant human leukemia cells which exhibit the classic MDR phenotype at a moderate level was examined. Twenty-four hours after the last ODN administration the cells were analyzed for mdr1-mRNA (quantitative RT-PCR) and P170 expression (FCM), for R123 accumulation/efflux capacity (FCM) and for sensitivity to vincristine (MTT). In the parental drug-sensitive CCRF-CEM cells the mdr1-mRNA expression was assessed 24, 48 and 72 h after AS-ODN treatment administered as free phosphorothioate or conjugated with DMRIE-C. RESULTS: Cationic lipids produced a clear increase in cellular ODN uptake but also caused an increase in variability of uptake rates (30% vs. 10% variability after free phosphorothioates). Both AS-ODNs inhibit P170 expression whereby the antisense effect of the chimeric ODN seems to be stronger compared to the phosphorothioate (30% vs. 22% MRK16 staining). Consistent with the inhibition of P170 expression, an increased sensitivity to vincristine was observed. In parental drug-sensitive cells, AS-ODN treatment caused nearly complete inhibition of mdr1-mRNA expression (5% of control). CONCLUSION: The data demonstrate that it is nearly impossible to achieve a complete reversal of the MDR phenotype in drug-resistant cells using AS-ODNs. A more promising approach seems to be the prophylactic treatment with AS-ODNs.","['Dassow, H', 'Lassner, D', 'Remke, H', 'Preiss, R']","['Dassow H', 'Lassner D', 'Remke H', 'Preiss R']","['Department of Clinical Pharmacology, University of Leipzig, Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Germany,Int J Clin Pharmacol Ther,International journal of clinical pharmacology and therapeutics,9423309,IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/drug effects/*genetics/metabolism', 'DNA Primers', 'Drug Administration Schedule', '*Drug Resistance, Multiple', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Genes, MDR/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*drug therapy', 'Oligonucleotides, Antisense/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'RNA, Messenger/*drug effects', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects']",2000/04/28 09:00,2000/07/06 11:00,['2000/04/28 09:00'],"['2000/04/28 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/07/06 11:00 [medline]', '2000/04/28 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.5414/cpp38209 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Clin Pharmacol Ther. 2000 Apr;38(4):209-16. doi: 10.5414/cpp38209.,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (Oligonucleotides, Antisense)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The novel resistance modifying agents PSC 833, 280-446, and LY 335979 are primarily targeted at inhibition of Pgp, and their MRP inhibitory potential is largely unknown. OBJECTIVE: In the present study we addressed the effect of these agents on MRP-derived drug resistance. MATERIALS: Drug-resistant human leukemia cells with Pgp+/MRP- (KG1a/200, K562/150) and Pgp-/MRP+ (HL60/130) phenotypes were maintained in suspension cultures for experimental studies of drug accumulation and drug sensitization by Pgp inhibitors. METHODS: Intracellular accumulation of the fluorescent anthracycline daunorubicin was measured by flow cytometry and fluorescence detection. Daunorubicin dose-response curves were generated by non-linear regression of electronically measured cell counts of 72- - 96-h cultures. The half-maximal growth inhibitory dose (GI50) was used as measure of growth inhibition. RESULTS: All MDR phenotypes studied exercised significant resistance to daunorubicin. PSC 833, 280-446 and LY335979 were equal in sensitizing Pgp+/MRP- cells to daunorubicin-induced growth inhibition (p < 0.0001). The Pgp-/MRP+ cells responded to PSC 833 and 280-446 by increased accumulation of daunorubicin (p = 0.0022 and p = 0.0005, respectively) and sensitization to the drug (p = 0.0009 and p = 0.0007, respectively). Conversely, LY335979 did not affect accumulation of daunorubicin in Pgp-/MRP+ cells nor sensitize these cells to daunorubicin. CONCLUSION: Pgp inhibitory agents have differential effects on MRP-derived drug resistance which could be exploited in treatment of multidrug resistance in cancer patients.","['Lehne, G', 'Morkrid, L', 'den Boer, M', 'Rugstad, H E']","['Lehne G', 'Morkrid L', 'den Boer M', 'Rugstad HE']","['Department of Clinical Pharmacology, Institute for Surgical Reseach, The National Hospital, Rikshospitalet, University of Oslo, Norway.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Int J Clin Pharmacol Ther,International journal of clinical pharmacology and therapeutics,9423309,IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/*metabolism', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Cyclosporins/pharmacology', 'Daunorubicin/*metabolism', 'Dibenzocycloheptenes/pharmacology', '*Drug Resistance, Multiple', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Fluorescence', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*metabolism/pathology', 'Peptides, Cyclic/pharmacology', 'Quinolines/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects']",2000/04/28 09:00,2000/07/06 11:00,['2000/04/28 09:00'],"['2000/04/28 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/07/06 11:00 [medline]', '2000/04/28 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.5414/cpp38187 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Clin Pharmacol Ther. 2000 Apr;38(4):187-95. doi: 10.5414/cpp38187.,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B)', '0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Cyclosporins)', '0 (Dibenzocycloheptenes)', '0 (Peptides, Cyclic)', '0 (Quinolines)', '129893-84-1 (SDZ 280 446)', '813AGY3126 (zosuquidar trihydrochloride)', 'Q7ZP55KF3X (valspodar)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: The antigen was measured by staining PGP using the monoclonal antibody 4e3 which does not inhibit the function of PGP. The 4e3 antibody binds to an external epitope of PGP and can therefore be used for staining living cells. Drug transport, mediated by PGP, was determined simultaneously by measuring rhodamine 123 (rho123) efflux. The MDR cell lines, CEM/VLB10-2 and CEM/VBL100 are 10-fold and 270-fold resistant to vinblastine (VBL), respectively, compared to the human PGP-negative parent cell line CEM/WT and they express different amounts of PGP. Initially, living cells were stained using the 4e3 antibody and a secondary antibody labeled with 7-amino-4-methylcoumarin-3-acetic acid (AMCA). Cells were then incubated for 60 min with rho123 (10 microM) and analyzed for rhodamine and AMCA-derived fluorescence. The decrease in rho123 fluorescence was determined after a further period of 30 min. RESULTS: CEM/VLB100 cells expressed larger amounts of PGP, and rho123 fluorescence after 30 min was 85% lower than the parent cell line. PGP expression and rho123 efflux were also detected in CEM/VLB10-2 cells which display a low degree of resistance, thus reflecting the high sensitivity of this method. PGP-expressing blasts and moderate rho123 efflux were also observed in a specimen derived from a patient with clinically resistant acute myeloid leukemia (AML). CONCLUSION: A multiparametric approach using flow-cytometry allows the reliable and sensitive measurement of both PGP expression and function simultaneously in single cells.","['Muller, M R', 'Lennartz, K', 'Baack, B', 'Heim, M M', 'Seeber, S', 'Scheulen, M E']","['Muller MR', 'Lennartz K', 'Baack B', 'Heim MM', 'Seeber S', 'Scheulen ME']","['Department of Internal Medicine (Cancer Research), West Germany Cancer Centre Essen, University of Essen Medical School, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Int J Clin Pharmacol Ther,International journal of clinical pharmacology and therapeutics,9423309,IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B/*analysis', 'Acute Disease', 'Drug Resistance, Multiple', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*metabolism/pathology', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2000/04/28 09:00,2000/07/06 11:00,['2000/04/28 09:00'],"['2000/04/28 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/07/06 11:00 [medline]', '2000/04/28 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.5414/cpp38180 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Clin Pharmacol Ther. 2000 Apr;38(4):180-6. doi: 10.5414/cpp38180.,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

All patients but one have received corticosteroid or antineoplastic agents before the occurrence of CMV infection. The types of CMV infections were interstitial pneumonia (23 cases), retinitis (2 cases), enteritis (one case), and persistent pyrexia (one case). Nine cases were diagnosed by histopathology and 5 of these 9 cases were discovered as having a CMV infection at autopsy. 20 cases were treated with ganciclovir for CMV infection, but only 9 cases improved. Of the 9 cases diagnosed by CMV-antigenemia, which had been introduced in the late 1994, 4 cases whose lymphoid tumor had been controlled responded to ganciclovir and survived but others with uncontrollable disease died. The present study indicates that the progress in the treatment of CMV infection was achieved in patients with controllable hematological disease but not in patients with refractory disease even after introduction of CMV-antigenemia.","['Sakai, C', 'Kumagai, K', 'Takagi, T']","['Sakai C', 'Kumagai K', 'Takagi T']","['Division of Hematology & Chemotherapy, Chiba Cancer Center Hospital.']",['jpn'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Japan,Kansenshogaku Zasshi,Kansenshogaku zasshi.

We have established an erythroleukemia cell model to study how Notch regulates cell fate and erythroleukemic cell differentiation. K562 and HEL cells expressed the Notch-1 receptor and the Notch ligand Jagged-1. The stable expression of the constitutively active intracellular domain of Notch-1 (NIC-1) in K562 cells inhibited erythroid without affecting megakaryocytic maturation. Expression of antisense Notch-1 induced spontaneous erythroid maturation. Suppression of erythroid maturation by NIC-1 did not result from down-regulation of GATA-1 and TAL-1, transcription factors necessary for erythroid differentiation. Microarray gene expression analysis identified genes activated during erythroid maturation, and NIC-1 disrupted the maturation-dependent changes in the expression of these genes. These results show that NIC-1 alters the pattern of gene expression in K562 cells leading to a block in erythroid maturation and therefore suggest that Notch signaling may control the developmental potential of normal and malignant erythroid progenitor cells.","['Lam, L T', 'Ronchini, C', 'Norton, J', 'Capobianco, A J', 'Bresnick, E H']","['Lam LT', 'Ronchini C', 'Norton J', 'Capobianco AJ', 'Bresnick EH']","['University of Wisconsin Medical School, Department of Pharmacology, Molecular and Cellular Pharmacology Program, Madison, Wisconsin 53706, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,IM,"['Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors', 'Benzidines/pharmacology', 'Blotting, Western', 'Calcium-Binding Proteins', 'Cell Differentiation/physiology', 'DNA, Antisense/metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/metabolism', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Down-Regulation', 'Erythrocytes/*cytology', 'Erythroid-Specific DNA-Binding Factors', 'GATA1 Transcription Factor', 'Hemin/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins', 'Jagged-1 Protein', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/metabolism', 'Ligands', 'Megakaryocytes/*cytology', 'Membrane Proteins/biosynthesis/*metabolism/physiology', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Plasmids', 'Protein Biosynthesis', 'Proteins/metabolism', '*Proto-Oncogene Proteins', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Receptor, Notch1', '*Receptors, Cell Surface', 'Retroviridae/metabolism', 'Serrate-Jagged Proteins', 'Signal Transduction', 'T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1', 'Time Factors', 'Transcription Factors/metabolism', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2000/04/28 09:00,2000/08/12 11:00,['2000/04/28 09:00'],"['2000/04/28 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/08/12 11:00 [medline]', '2000/04/28 09:00 [entrez]']","['10.1074/jbc.M002866200 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(19)80035-2 [pii]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2000 Jun 30;275(26):19676-84. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M002866200.,"['0 (Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors)', '0 (Benzidines)', '0 (Calcium-Binding Proteins)', '0 (DNA, Antisense)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Erythroid-Specific DNA-Binding Factors)', '0 (GATA1 Transcription Factor)', '0 (GATA1 protein, human)', '0 (Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (JAG1 protein, human)', '0 (Jagged-1 Protein)', '0 (Ligands)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (NOTCH1 protein, human)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptor, Notch1)', '0 (Receptors, Cell Surface)', '0 (Serrate-Jagged Proteins)', '0 (T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '135471-20-4 (TAL1 protein, human)', '2X02101HVF (benzidine)', '743LRP9S7N (Hemin)']",,,,['DK50107/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

TNF-alpha-dependent p38 MAPK activation was detected in both Mo7e and Hut-78 cells and was blocked by the p38 MAPK inhibitor, SB203580. Ablation of p38 MAPK activity by SB203580 abrogated TNF-alpha-induced Mo7e cell proliferation and TNF-alpha-dependent autocrine growth of Hut-78. As we have shown previously that activation of the nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB) is also required for TNF-alpha-induced Mo7e cell proliferation, the involvement of p38 MAPK in NF-kappaB activation was assessed. SB203580 did not affect TNF-alpha-signaled nuclear translocation and DNA-binding activity of NF-kappaB, and inhibition of NF-kappaB function did not affect TNF-alpha-induced p38 MAPK activation, indicating that these events are not dependent on each other. However, SB203580 depressed the expression of NF-kappaB-dependent genes, as monitored by a kappaB-driven reporter gene. Our findings demonstrate that activation of both p38 MAPK and NF-kappaB plays a critical role in TNF-alpha-mediated survival and proliferation of human leukemia and lymphoma cells, and p38 MAPK acts at least in part by facilitating the transcriptional activation function of NF-kappaB.","['Liu, R Y', 'Fan, C', 'Liu, G', 'Olashaw, N E', 'Zuckerman, K S']","['Liu RY', 'Fan C', 'Liu G', 'Olashaw NE', 'Zuckerman KS']","['Departments of Internal Medicine, Biochemistry/Molecular Biology and Anatomy, University of South Florida, and H.

The paucity of agents that can selectively and potently block TNF-alpha processing or its receptors has led us to investigate the role of TNF-alpha in chronic neurodegeneration associated with retroviral infection using mice with targeted deletions of the TNF-alpha gene. Infection of wild-type C57BL/6 mice with the LP-BM5 murine leukemia retrovirus mixture leads to the development of a severe immunodeficiency as well as cognitive deficits and neuronal damage. TNF-alpha-(-/-) mice infected with LP-BM5 developed a systemic immunopathology indistinguishable in severity from that observed in contemporaneously infected wild-type mice. In contrast, the performance of infected TNF-alpha-(-/-) mice in the Y-maze and Morris water maze was not different from that of uninfected TNF-alpha-(-/-) mice. The extent of glial activation in the striatum, as indicated by the increase in density of peripheral benzodiazepine receptors, was equivalent in both groups of LP-BM5-infected mice. However, the decrease in striatal MAP-2 expression, a marker of neurodegeneration observed in infected wild-type mice, was not found in infected TNF-alpha-(-/-) mice. While the loss of TNF-alpha appeared to have no effect on the course or severity of the central or peripheral immunopathology resulting from LP-BM5 infection, the behavioral and biochemical manifestations were substantially curtailed in the TNF-alpha-(-/-) mice. These findings directly support a role for TNF-alpha in the neurodegenerative processes associated with viral infections such as HIV-1.","['Iida, R', 'Saito, K', 'Yamada, K', 'Basile, A S', 'Sekikawa, K', 'Takemura, M', 'Fujii, H', 'Wada, H', 'Seishima, M', 'Nabeshima, T']","['Iida R', 'Saito K', 'Yamada K', 'Basile AS', 'Sekikawa K', 'Takemura M', 'Fujii H', 'Wada H', 'Seishima M', 'Nabeshima T']","['Department of Neuropsychopharmacology and Hospital Pharmacy, Nagoya University Graduate School of Medicine, Nagoya 466-8560, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,FASEB J,FASEB journal : official publication of the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology,8804484,IM,"['Animals', 'CD4-CD8 Ratio', '*Gene Deletion', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*physiology', 'Maze Learning', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Nervous System Diseases/genetics/*prevention & control', 'Retroviridae Infections/immunology/*physiopathology', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/*genetics']",2000/04/27 09:00,2000/06/03 09:00,['2000/04/27 09:00'],"['2000/04/27 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/06/03 09:00 [medline]', '2000/04/27 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1096/fasebj.14.7.1023 [doi]'],ppublish,FASEB J. 2000 May;14(7):1023-31. doi: 10.1096/fasebj.14.7.1023.,['0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Growth studies based on dye exclusion by viable cells while using a sublethal concentration of oxysterols ranked their potency for cell kill as 25OHC > K15 > CK15 > CK7. Both the TUNEL assay (terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP-X nick end labeling), which quantifies the amount of DNA nicks caused by a toxic agent, and the MTT assay, which measures cell metabolism and thus reflects cell viability, substantiated the same rank order. An ELISA assay for evaluating release of DNA fragments into the cytosol after treatment gave a similar potency order. The oncogene c-myc mRNA was suppressed by all three oxysterols, with 25OHC and K15 being the most potent suppressors. Hoechst and Annexin V staining documented that these oxysterols kill cells by an apoptotic pathway as evidenced by condensation of nuclear chromatin and plasma membrane inversion, respectively.

RESULTS: TNF-alpha and HTLV-I tax/rex mRNA were preferentially expressed in CD68+ cells in HAAP synovia. Infection of OA synoviocytes by HTLV-I resulted in preferential expression in CD68+ cells, and these cells produced TNF-alpha. Supernatants of HTLV-I infected synoviocytes significantly enhanced the proliferation of normal synoviocytes through a TNF-alpha dependent pathway.

It has since been identified, however, in a minority of cases of T-lympho-blastic lymphoma/leukemia and other hematopoietic and nonhematopoietic entities. The usual method for the detection of CD10 previously required fresh tissue. A new antibody for CD10 (56C6) in paraffin embedded tissue sections, however, has recently become available. OBJECTIVE: To study the expression of CD10 in paraffin sections of T-lymphoblastic lymphoma/leukemia using monoclonal antibody 56C6. DESIGN: Twenty-four cases of T-lymphoblastic lymphoma/leukemia in various anatomic sites were studied. Immunohistochemical analysis with CD10 and a panel of other hematolymphoid antibodies was performed in all 24 cases. Gene rearrangement studies for the T-cell receptor by the polymerase chain reaction were performed in 18 of 24 cases. RESULTS: All cases were positive with at least 2 T-cell markers. In 15 (63%) of 24 cases CD10 was positive. T-cell receptor gene rearrangement was detected in 10 of 18 cases. CONCLUSIONS: Immunodetection of CD10 in T-lympho-blastic lymphoma/leukemia using monoclonal antibody 56C6 is common. This finding is useful in the evaluation of T-cell neoplasms.","['Conde-Sterling, D A', 'Aguilera, N S', 'Nandedkar, M A', 'Abbondanzo, S L']","['Conde-Sterling DA', 'Aguilera NS', 'Nandedkar MA', 'Abbondanzo SL']","['Armed Forces Institute of Pathology, Department of Hematopathology, Washington, DC 20306-6000, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Arch Pathol Lab Med,Archives of pathology & laboratory medicine,7607091,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/metabolism', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunoenzyme Techniques', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neprilysin/*metabolism', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/genetics']",2000/04/27 09:00,2000/07/06 11:00,['2000/04/27 09:00'],"['2000/04/27 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/07/06 11:00 [medline]', '2000/04/27 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.5858/2000-124-0704-IDOCIP [doi]'],ppublish,Arch Pathol Lab Med. 2000 May;124(5):704-8. doi: 10.5858/2000-124-0704-IDOCIP.,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)', 'EC 3.4.24.11 (Neprilysin)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here we show that U2-OS, a widely used osteoblastic cell line derived from an osteosarcoma, has the capacity to support proliferation of human hematopoietic progenitor cells in vitro. In this study, U2-OS cells are characterized at the molecular level to unravel the molecular mechanisms underlying the support of hematopoiesis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: U2-OS was analyzed in great detail using RT-PCR and flow cytometry. In addition, a cDNA library was constructed and randomly sequenced to obtain insight in the repertoire of expressed molecules. RESULTS: A broad panel of growth factors and cytokines is expressed by U2-OS. TGF-beta, GM-CSF, c-kit ligand, and IL-7 are produced constitutively and IL-1beta, IL-6, IL-8, TNF-alpha, IFN-gamma, and MIP1-alpha are upregulated upon stimulation. In addition to those, mRNAs of the CC chemokine LARC and leukemia inhibitory factor were identified. U2-OS cells express high levels of beta1-integrins at the cell surface: VLA-2, VLA-3, VLA-4, VLA-5, VLA-6, and the integrin alphavbeta3. Besides integrins, ALCAM and NCAM are detected on the cell surface of U2-OS. Interestingly, we show that CD34(+) progenitor cells expressing ALCAM are highly proliferative when compared with CD34(+) ALCAM(low) cells, hinting at a role for ALCAM in anchoring progenitor cells to the bone marrow stroma. Interestingly, random sequencing of an U2-OS cDNA library yielded almost 10% of novel cDNAs with a potential role in hematopoiesis. The involvement of these novel molecules in hematopoiesis is an interesting target for future investigations. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that U2-OS supports outgrowth of hematopoietic progenitor cells and accordingly expresses adhesion molecules and growth factors and a number of novel, as yet uncharacterized potentially interesting genes.","['Nelissen, J M', 'Torensma, R', 'Pluyter, M', 'Adema, G J', 'Raymakers, R A', 'van Kooyk, Y', 'Figdor, C G']","['Nelissen JM', 'Torensma R', 'Pluyter M', 'Adema GJ', 'Raymakers RA', 'van Kooyk Y', 'Figdor CG']","['Department of Tumor Immunology, University Hospital Nijmegen St. Radboud, Nijmegen, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,IM,"['Activated-Leukocyte Cell Adhesion Molecule/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Antigens, CD/biosynthesis', 'Antigens, CD34/biosynthesis', 'Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte/biosynthesis', 'Cell Adhesion Molecules/biosynthesis', 'Cell Division/genetics', 'Cell Membrane/metabolism', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Cytokines/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Gene Library', 'Growth Substances/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Hematopoiesis/*physiology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Hyaluronan Receptors/biosynthesis', 'Integrins/biosynthesis', 'Ionomycin/pharmacology', 'Osteoblasts/*metabolism/pathology', 'Osteosarcoma/*metabolism/pathology', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis', 'Receptors, CXCR3', 'Receptors, Cell Surface/biosynthesis', 'Receptors, Chemokine/biosynthesis', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology']",2000/04/27 09:00,2000/06/08 09:00,['2000/04/27 09:00'],"['2000/04/27 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/06/08 09:00 [medline]', '2000/04/27 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0301-472X(00)00127-2 [pii]', '10.1016/s0301-472x(00)00127-2 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Hematol. 2000 Apr;28(4):422-32. doi: 10.1016/s0301-472x(00)00127-2.,"['0 (Activated-Leukocyte Cell Adhesion Molecule)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte)', '0 (CD6 antigen)', '0 (CXCR3 protein, human)', '0 (Cell Adhesion Molecules)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Growth Substances)', '0 (Hyaluronan Receptors)', '0 (Integrins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, CXCR3)', '0 (Receptors, Cell Surface)', '0 (Receptors, Chemokine)', '56092-81-0 (Ionomycin)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recently, we have shown that ATRA efficiency to differentiate HL-60 cells was enhanced about 30 times after its incorporation into Low Density Lipoprotein (ATRA-LDL). Here, we attempted to differentiate the ATRA-resistant HL-60 cells by ATRA-LDL at high concentrations up to 10 microM. No significant differentiating effect was observed, although the LDL receptor sites were evidenced in these cells. To increase the number of LDL receptors, the cells were pre-incubated in lipoprotein-deprived serum medium and compactin (2 microM), both ATRA and ATRA-LDL induced gradual increase of cell differentiation (35%+/-1 and 51.5%+/-5 at 10 microM of ATRA and ATRA-LDL respectively). At 2 and 8 microM, the intracellular concentrations of ATRA were respectively three and four times higher when incorporated into LDL. In addition, ATRA-LDL, in the medium, was better protected against degradation than ATRA. The surprising restoration of free ATRA sensitivity after treatment with compactin suggested the implication of new mechanisms unrelated to the LDL-receptor endocytosis but involving the non-sterol pathway.","['Gueddari, N', 'Madoulet, C', 'Lefebvre, P', 'Berthou, L', 'Chomienne, C', 'Jardillier, J C']","['Gueddari N', 'Madoulet C', 'Lefebvre P', 'Berthou L', 'Chomienne C', 'Jardillier JC']","['EA2063 TFR53 Biomolecules Laboratoire de Biochimie, U.F.R. de Pharmacie 51 rue Cognacq-Jay 51096, Reims, France.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacokinetics', 'Binding, Competitive', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Drug Interactions', '*Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*metabolism', 'Lovastatin/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Receptors, LDL/metabolism', 'Tretinoin/*pharmacokinetics', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2000/04/27 09:00,2000/07/25 11:00,['2000/04/27 09:00'],"['2000/04/27 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/07/25 11:00 [medline]', '2000/04/27 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0145-2126(00)00019-9 [pii]', '10.1016/s0145-2126(00)00019-9 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 2000 Jun;24(6):543-8. doi: 10.1016/s0145-2126(00)00019-9.,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Receptors, LDL)', '1UQM1K0W9X (mevastatin)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', '9LHU78OQFD (Lovastatin)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The sensitivities of K562/AC to adriamycin (ADR), vincristine (VCR) and etoposide (VP16) were similar to those of parental K562. Gene analysis revealed that this cell line lacked expression of the deoxycytidine kinase (dCK) gene, which was evident in Ara-C-sensitive cells. As in K562 cells, multidrug resistance (MDR-1) and multidrug resistance protein (MRP) genes were not expressed in K562/AC. We also established an in vitro model of Ara-C resistance using phosphorothioate antisense oligonucleotides to dCK (dCK-AS). Treatment of K562 with dCK-AS caused decreased dCK expression and 6- to 10-fold increases in resistance to Ara-C, compared with that in cells treated with sense oligonucleotides to dCK (dCK-S) or in non-transfected cells. The cells described here may contribute to the study of a novel mechanism associated with Ara-C resistance, in which reduced dCK activity may play an important role.","['Funato, T', 'Satou, J', 'Nishiyama, Y', 'Fujimaki, S', 'Miura, T', 'Kaku, M', 'Sasaki, T']","['Funato T', 'Satou J', 'Nishiyama Y', 'Fujimaki S', 'Miura T', 'Kaku M', 'Sasaki T']","['Department of Molecular Genetics, School of Medicine, Tohoku University, Seiryoumachi 1-1, Aoba-ku, Sendai, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,IM,"['Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/*therapeutic use', 'Cytarabine/*therapeutic use', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', '*Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy/genetics', 'Oligodeoxyribonucleotides, Antisense/pharmacology', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2000/04/27 09:00,2000/07/25 11:00,['2000/04/27 09:00'],"['2000/04/27 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/07/25 11:00 [medline]', '2000/04/27 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0145-2126(00)00016-3 [pii]', '10.1016/s0145-2126(00)00016-3 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 2000 Jun;24(6):535-41. doi: 10.1016/s0145-2126(00)00016-3.,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Oligodeoxyribonucleotides, Antisense)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

While most CyD1 levels in MCL varied from 6.5 to 15.6, the median CyD1/BCL1 in CLL was 1.4 with 75th percentile under 2.12. Rare CLL cases (3.5%) showed levels between 4 and 8.83. When divided into two groups at the median level, patients with higher CyD1/BCL1 expression had shorter survival (P = 0.03). This remained true when applied only to the previously untreated patients (P=0.05). Despite the relatively low expression, the CyD1/BCL1 levels in univariate analysis were as good or better predictors of survival than Binet (P = 0.03) or Rai (P = 0.05) staging. Furthermore, CyD1/BCL1 levels correlated with serum beta2-microglobulin (P = 0.001), white blood cell count (P = 0.004) and hemoglobin levels at the time of collection (P = 0.0003) but not with lymphocyte count, platelet count or age. The data demonstrate that CyD1/BCL1 is likely to play a significant role in the biology of CLL and can be used as a prognostic indicator. Further studies to clarify the role of CyD1 in the biology of CLL and its value as a prognostic indicator at the time of diagnosis are encouraged.","['Ravandi-Kashani, F', ""O'Brien, S"", 'Manshouri, T', 'Lerner, S', 'Sim, S', 'Dodd, K', 'Kantarjian, H', 'Freireich, E', 'Keating, M', 'Albitar, M']","['Ravandi-Kashani F', ""O'Brien S"", 'Manshouri T', 'Lerner S', 'Sim S', 'Dodd K', 'Kantarjian H', 'Freireich E', 'Keating M', 'Albitar M']","['Department of Leukemia, Division of Medicine, The University of Texas, M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030-4095, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cyclin D1/*analysis', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*blood/mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Monocytes/chemistry', 'Prognosis', 'Radioimmunoassay', 'Survival Rate']",2000/04/27 09:00,2000/07/25 11:00,['2000/04/27 09:00'],"['2000/04/27 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/07/25 11:00 [medline]', '2000/04/27 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0145-2126(00)00008-4 [pii]', '10.1016/s0145-2126(00)00008-4 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 2000 Jun;24(6):469-74. doi: 10.1016/s0145-2126(00)00008-4.,['136601-57-5 (Cyclin D1)'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the present study, urinary 8-OHdG was examined in 44 patients with hematological disorders (13 malignant lymphoma, 11 adult T cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATL), 10 acute leukemia, and 10 myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS)) by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The pre-therapy level of urinary 8-OHdG in ATL patients was significantly elevated compared with normal controls (25.3+/-12.9 vs. 11.9+/-7.3 ng/mg, P<0.05). Although patients with lymphoma, acute leukemia and MDS also showed higher urinary 8-OHdG levels than normal controls, the differences were not significant. However, two patients with refractory anemia with excess blasts in transformation (RAEB-t) having extreme monocytosis and neutrophilia showed exceptionally high urinary 8-OHdG levels (161.0 and 218.9 ng/mg). Urinary 8-OHdG excretion increased transiently with chemotherapy, and this fluctuation was significant irrespective of the disorder (P<0.05). Interestingly, lymphoma patients with high LDH, advanced stage, poor performance status or International Prognostic Index (IPI) of high/high-intermediate risk had significantly elevated urinary 8-OHdG levels (P<0.05-<0.001). These latter results suggest that urinary 8-OHdG may be a reliable prognostic marker in lymphoma patients and should encourage large scale and long term follow up studies.","['Honda, M', 'Yamada, Y', 'Tomonaga, M', 'Ichinose, H', 'Kamihira, S']","['Honda M', 'Yamada Y', 'Tomonaga M', 'Ichinose H', 'Kamihira S']","['Department of Hematology, Molecular Medicine Unit, Atomic Bomb Disease Institute, Nagasaki, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,IM,"[""8-Hydroxy-2'-Deoxyguanosine"", 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', '*DNA Damage', 'Deoxyguanosine/*analogs & derivatives/urine', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Female', 'Hematologic Diseases/drug therapy/*urine', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Oxidative Stress', 'Pilot Projects']",2000/04/27 09:00,2000/07/25 11:00,['2000/04/27 09:00'],"['2000/04/27 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/07/25 11:00 [medline]', '2000/04/27 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0145-2126(00)00006-0 [pii]', '10.1016/s0145-2126(00)00006-0 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 2000 Jun;24(6):461-8. doi: 10.1016/s0145-2126(00)00006-0.,"[""88847-89-6 (8-Hydroxy-2'-Deoxyguanosine)"", 'G9481N71RO (Deoxyguanosine)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Parvovirus B19 and transfusion transmitted virus (TTV) are two of several non-enveloped viruses that may on rare occasions be present in coagulation factor concentrates. The prevalence of these viruses in the South African Haemophilia population has not previously been studied. Thirty-nine Haemophiliac children were investigated for evidence of parvovirus and TTV infection. 26 boys with Haemophilia A had been treated with cryoprecipitate or intermediate purity factor VIII, and 13 boys with Haemophilia B had received prothrombin complex concentrates. All the plasma products were prepared from South African donors and were virally inactivated by heat or solvent/detergent since 1992. A control group of 32 children who had not been transfused were also studied. IgG antibodies to B19 were present in 29 of the 39 patients (74%), 18/26 (69%) with Haemophilia A and 12 of the 13 (85%) with Haemophilia B. None of the patients was IgM antibody positive but two children were PCR positive for B19 DNA. Of the control children, 47% had IgG antibodies to B19, but none were IgM antibody or B19 DNA positive. TTV viral DNA was found in 10.2% of patients and in 9% of the control group.

Several lines of evidence suggest a critical role for the EZH2 protein during normal and perturbed development of the haematopoietic and central nervous systems. Indeed, the EZH2 protein has been shown to associate with the Vav proto-oncoprotein and with the XNP protein, the product of a mental retardation gene. The EZH2 gene was previously reported to be located on chromosome 21q22 and was proposed as a candidate gene for some characteristics of the Down syndrome phenotype. We report here the genomic structure and fine mapping of the EZH2 gene. We demonstrate that the functional gene actually maps to chromosome 7q35 and that the sequence previously isolated from a chromosome 21 cosmid corresponds to a pseudogene.

In the past, SCID mice have provided a variety of useful XT models for human hematopoietic neoplasms that primarily involve the acute leukemias and some nonhematopoietic tumors, but only rare reports exist on use of the SCID mouse model in the study of primary tumor cells from NHL. Intermediate-grade and low-grade NHL are the most common lymphomas seen in adults. There is no effective therapy for those types of NHL, and they have not been established in an animal model to date. The lack of an animal model has hampered studies that can evaluate the disease process in vivo as well as the definition of therapeutic parameters involved in treatment. We report in this study that primary patient samples of NHL ( intermediate grade and low grade) have been successfully established in SCID mice after XT. NHL include intermediate-grade (mantle cell lymphoma) and low-grade (eg, small lymphocytic lymphoma/chronic lymphocytic lymphoma and marginal zone lymphoma) forms. Studies have been directed toward creating appropriate conditions for the optimal grafting of these NHL in SCID mice so that the disease process in humans could be accurately simulated. These studies indicate that development of XT-human lymphoma cells in SCID mice appear to be linked to their biologic and/or clinical behavior, transplanted lymphoma cell number, and age, as well as to the natural killer cell status of the SCID mouse recipients. Evidence has also shown that NHL cells can exhibit homing or trafficking patterns in SCID recipients that resemble those observed in patients with gastrointestinal lymphomatous involvement (particularly that of mantle cell lymphoma). Our studies also indicate that artefactual influences, such as the outgrowth of Epstein-Barr virus-associated lymphoblastoid lesions, are rare occurrences in the human NHL/SCID models that we have established.","['Bryant, J', 'Pham, L', 'Yoshimura, L', 'Tamayo, A', 'Ordonez, N', 'Ford, R J']","['Bryant J', 'Pham L', 'Yoshimura L', 'Tamayo A', 'Ordonez N', 'Ford RJ']","['Department of Molecular Pathology, The University of Texas, M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston 77030, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Lab Invest,Laboratory investigation; a journal of technical methods and pathology,0376617,IM,"['Adult', 'Animals', '*Disease Models, Animal', 'Humans', '*Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell', '*Lymphoma, Mantle-Cell', 'Mice', 'Mice, SCID', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Transplantation, Heterologous']",2000/04/26 09:00,2000/05/16 09:00,['2000/04/26 09:00'],"['2000/04/26 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/05/16 09:00 [medline]', '2000/04/26 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/labinvest.3780061 [doi]'],ppublish,Lab Invest. 2000 Apr;80(4):557-73. doi: 10.1038/labinvest.3780061.,,,,,"['CA16672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA62594/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA65412/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the functional role of overexpressed PDPK F(A) in cancer remains to be established. In this report, we explore the potential role of PDPK F(A) in leukaemia cell growth by investigating the effects of partial inhibition of this kinase on the malignant phenotype of human chronic myeloid leukaemia cells (K562). Cloning of PDPK F(A) cDNA and its recombinant antisense expression vector and PDPK F(A)-specific antibody were successfully developed. Two stable antisense clones of K562 cells were subcloned which expressed 70% and 45% of PDPK F(A) respectively, compared with control-transfected clone in both immunoprecipitate activity assay and immunoblot analysis. In sharp contrast, these two antisense clones expressed no significant suppression of any other related PDPK family members, indicating the specificity of these two antisense clones. Moreover, these antisense clones proportionally and potentially exhibited cell growth retardation, poor clonogenic growth in soft agar and loss of serum independence. The results demonstrate that specific antisense suppression of PDPK F(A) is sufficient to interfere with the growth of K562 cells, indicating that PDPK F(A) is essential for human chronic myeloid leukaemia cell growth.","['Hsu, C P', 'Hsueh, S F', 'Yang, C C', 'Yang, S D']","['Hsu CP', 'Hsueh SF', 'Yang CC', 'Yang SD']","['Department of Life Science, National Tsing Hua University, Taiwan, Republic of China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Cancer,British journal of cancer,0370635,IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Antibodies/pharmacology', 'Calcium-Calmodulin-Dependent Protein Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors/*genetics/metabolism', '*Cell Division', 'Clone Cells', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'DNA, Antisense', 'Genetic Vectors', 'Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Peptide Fragments/immunology', 'Phosphopeptides/chemistry/metabolism', 'Recombinant Proteins/biosynthesis/metabolism', 'Substrate Specificity', 'Suppression, Genetic', 'Transfection']",2000/04/26 09:00,2000/05/16 09:00,['2000/04/26 09:00'],"['2000/04/26 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/05/16 09:00 [medline]', '2000/04/26 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0007092099911333 [pii]', '10.1054/bjoc.1999.1133 [doi]']",ppublish,Br J Cancer. 2000 Apr;82(8):1480-4. doi: 10.1054/bjoc.1999.1133.,"['0 (Antibodies)', '0 (DNA, Antisense)', '0 (Peptide Fragments)', '0 (Phosphopeptides)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.11.17 (Calcium-Calmodulin-Dependent Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.26 (Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3)']",,PMC2363367,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The authors present a case of t-AML that developed in a child with metastatic neuroblastoma 18 months after he received oral etoposide, given for palliation purpose. The leukemic blasts were examined by morphological, immunohistochemical, cytogenetic, and molecular genetic analyses. Although the t-AML developed following oral etoposide therapy, the child had previously received high-dose, multiagent chemotherapy, and rearrangement of the MLL gene was not demonstrated. The use of modern multiagent therapy often makes it difficult to appropriately apportion blame for causation of specific side effects. Moreover, the etiology of t-AML and mechanism of leukemogenesis are likely to be multifactorial and complex. Further studies on the precise association with different therapies are thus needed.

Accordingly, L5178Y (LY) mouse lymphoma cell lines, which display a unique inverse cross-sensitivity to ionizing radiation (IR) and hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)), are a suitable model for the study of possible differences in the constitutive control of intracellular iron availability. We report here that the level of iron in the cytosolic labile iron pool (LIP), ie, potentially active in the Fenton reaction, is more than 3-fold higher in IR-resistant, H(2)O(2)-sensitive (LY-R) cells than in IR-sensitive, H(2)O(2)-resistant (LY-S) cells. This difference is associated with markedly greater content of ferritin H-subunits (H-Ft) in LY-S than in LY-R cells. Our results show that different expression of H-Ft in LY cells is a consequence of an up-regulation of H-Ft mRNA in the LY-S mutant cell line. In contrast, posttranscriptional control of iron metabolism mediated by iron-responsive element-iron regulatory proteins (IRPs) interaction is similar in the 2 cell lines, although IRP1 protein levels in iron-rich LY-R cells are twice those in iron-deficient LY-S cells. In showing that LY cell lines exhibit 2 different patterns of intracellular iron regulation, our results highlight both the role of high LIP in the establishment of pro-oxidant status in mammalian cells and the antioxidant role of ferritin.

A newly described 230-kd form of Bcr-Abl has been associated with an indolent myeloproliferative syndrome referred to as chronic neutrophilic leukemia. We have cloned the corresponding gene and examined the biologic and biochemical properties of p230 Bcr-Abl after retroviral-mediated gene transfer into hematopoietic cell lines and primary bone marrow cells. p230 Bcr-Abl-expressing 32D myeloid cells were fully growth factor-independent and activated similar signal transduction pathways as the well-characterized p210 and p185 forms of Bcr-Abl. In contrast, primary mouse bone marrow cells expressing p230 required exogenous hematopoietic growth factors for optimal growth, whereas p185- and p210-expressing cells were independent of growth factors. The 3 Bcr-Abl proteins exerted different effects on differentiation of bone marrow cells. p185 induced outgrowth of lymphoid precursors capable of tumor formation in immunodeficient mice. In contrast, p210- and p230-expressing bone marrow cells caused limited outgrowth of lymphoid precursors that failed to form tumors in immunodeficient mice. Removal of cytokines and autologous stroma from Bcr-Abl-expressing bone marrow cultures produced the expansion of distinct lineages by the various Bcr-Abl proteins. p185 drove expansion of cytokine-independent lymphoid progenitors, while p210 and p230 generated cytokine-independent monocyte/myeloid cells. These findings suggest that the different Bcr-Abl fusion proteins drive the expansion of different hematopoietic populations, which may explain the association of the various Bcr-Abl oncoproteins with different spectra of human leukemias.

To study the role of pgp in mediating apoptosis resistance in AML cells deprived of serum and growth factors, apoptosis was quantified by flow cytometry using uptake of the dye 7-amino-actinomycin D (7-AAD) alongside low forward scatter. In pgp+ve primary AML samples, there was a significant increase in apoptosis in the presence of the pgp-specific antibody UIC2 (mean increase: 58%; range: 11%-95%; P <. 05). Likewise, apoptosis in growth factor-deprived TF1 cells cultured for 30 hours increased 2.5-fold in the presence of 25 microg/mL UIC2. The pgp reversal agent PSC-833 (1 micromol/L) augmented in vitro apoptosis by a median of 52% in pgp+ve patient samples and to a comparable degree in 6 pgp-ve samples. To determine whether the sphingomyelin-ceramide (SM-ceramide) pathway of apoptosis occurs in AML blasts in response to cytotoxic drugs, cells were incubated with daunorubicin at the patient-specific IC(30) (the concentration of daunorubicin that caused apoptotic cell death in 30% of cells) in the presence of the ceramide synthase inhibitor fumonisin B1, which inhibited apoptosis by 18%-81% (median: 40%). Exogenous SM failed to augment apoptosis induced by growth factor withdrawal in pgp+ve TF1 cells and was significantly more effective at augmenting apoptosis in pgp-ve patient blasts (median increase in cell death: 33%; range: 19%-88%) than in pgp+ve samples (median: 7%; range: 0%-27%; P =.028). Cellular accumulation of exogenous SM was associated with apoptosis and also occurred in nonapoptotic patient cells treated with PSC-833. However, this effect was not seen following treatment with the UIC2 antibody. These results indicate that pgp is able to exert a protective effect on AML cell viability and that this is associated with a reduced effect of exogenous SM on apoptosis. The pgp reversal agent PSC-833 acts, at least in part, by a pgp independent mechanism to alter SM distribution and to augment apoptosis induced in AML cells by serum and growth factor withdrawal.

Several were identified as derivatives of the defensin family. Defensins (or human neutrophil peptides [HNP]) are antimicrobial, cationic peptides of 29 to 35 amino acids in length and are the major constituents of the azurophilic granules of human neutrophils. Using peripheral blood cells from leukapheresis, containing about 90% of polymorphonuclear cells, we could identify HNP-1, -2, and -4 and propeptides of up to 49 amino acids in length, eluted from HLA class II molecules. Binding of isolated and synthetic defensin peptides to various HLA-DR alleles using an in vitro binding/competition assay based on size exclusion chromatography revealed that defensin may bind into the peptide-binding groove. In a T-cell competition assay, defensins were able to reduce the proliferation of an HLA-DR-restricted T-cell line after preincubation of stimulating cells (CHO-DRB1*0401 transfectants) with defensin. Therefore, binding of defensins might prevent T-cell recognition of HLA class II molecules expressed on different blood precursor cells (all of which are ""nonprofessional"" antigen-presenting cells) by blocking the HLA peptide-binding groove or, alternatively, might protect defensin-expressing cells from self-destruction.

Nineteen were observed at the time of CLL diagnosis and 33 during the clinical follow-up. Ninety percent of the patients with CLL/AHA showed active CLL and 25% had been treated previously. The antierythrocyte autoantibody (AeAb) was an IgG in 87% of cases and an IgM in 13%. A lymphocyte count more than 60 x 10(9)/L (P <.00001), age above 65 years (P <.01), and male gender (P <.01) emerged as independent parameters that correlated significantly with an increased rate of AHA at CLL diagnosis. Patients previously treated with chlorambucil (CB) plus prednisone (PDN) and with fludarabine plus PDN showed a similar rate of AHA (1.8% and 2.5%, respectively). After steroid therapy associated with CB in case of active CLL, 70% of patients achieved the complete disappearance of the AeAb. The actuarial AHA relapse-free survival probability was 54% at 5 years and the median survival probability after AHA was 41 months. Infections represented the main cause of morbidity and mortality. IgG AHA and the occurrence of AHA at the same time of CLL diagnosis emerged as independent factors significantly correlated with a better survival probability of AHA/CLL patients. Taken together, this study indicates that in CLL, AHA is a rare event with no independent effect on survival for which steroids, associated with CB if required, and a careful management of infections may successfully control the 2 conditions. Cooperative studies are needed to better define the optimal steroid schedule and the therapeutic role of other immunosuppressive agents and splenectomy.

To evaluate the rate and type of SNs after Berlin-Frankfurt-Munster (BFM) treatment in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), we analyzed the data from the BFM database and the German Childhood Cancer Registry (GCCR). Between April 1979 and April 1995, 5006 children with B-precursor or T-ALL were enrolled in 5 ALL-BFM multicenter trials. The median follow-up time from diagnosis was 5.7 years (range 1.5-18 years). By December 1997, 52 SNs were documented, including 16 acute myeloid leukemias (AMLs), 13 neoplasms of the central nervous system (CNS), and 23 other neoplasms. Compared with the expected numbers estimated from incidence rates derived from the GCCR, this represented a 14-fold increase for all cancers and a 19-fold increase for CNS tumors. SNs developed 0.9 to 15 years (median: 6 years) after the diagnosis of ALL; 46 patients were in first complete remission (CR). The overall cumulative risk of SNs at 15 years was 3.3% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.6%-5.1%) and 2.9% (95% CI: 1.6%-4.2%) in first CR. The risk was 3.5% (95% CI: 1.5%-5. 5%) after treatment, including cranial irradiation and significantly lower in nonirradiated patients: 1.2% (95% CI: 0.2%-2.3%; P =.048). The development of secondary AML was not associated with the use of any specific cytotoxic agent. Considering the high-survival rate of this large unselected ALL cohort, the risk of SN is relatively low, though higher, especially after cranial irradiation, than in the general population. Long-term follow-up is mandatory, and further SNs with longer latency periods are to be expected.

To evaluate the reciprocal influence of HTLV-II and HIV-1 infection, primary peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) cultures from coinfected individuals were established in the presence of interleukin 2 (IL-2). In these cultures, the kinetics of HTLV-II replication always preceded those of HIV-1. Noteworthy, the kinetics of HIV-1 production were inversely correlated to the HTLV-II proviral load in vivo and its replication ex vivo. These observations suggested a potential interaction between the 2 retroviruses. In this regard, the levels of IL-2, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) were measured in the same coinfected PBMC cultures. Endogenous IL-2 was not produced, whereas IL-6 and TNF-alpha were secreted at levels compatible with their known ability to up-regulate HIV-1 expression. The HIV-suppressive CC-chemokines RANTES, macrophage inflammatory protein-1alpha (MIP-1alpha), and MIP-1beta were also determined in IL-2-stimulated PBMC cultures. Of interest, their kinetics and concentrations were inversely related to those of HIV-1 replication. Experiments were performed in which CD8(+) T cells or PBMCs from HTLV-II monoinfected individuals were cocultivated with CD4(+) T cells from HIV-1 monoinfected individuals separated by a semipermeable membrane in the presence or absence of antichemokine neutralizing antibodies. The results indicate that HTLV-II can interfere with the replicative potential of HIV-1 by up-regulating viral suppressive CC-chemokines and, in particular, MIP-1alpha. This study is the first report indicating that HTLV-II can influence HIV replication, at least in vitro, via up-regulation of HIV-suppressive chemokines.

Studies of inflammatory pathways involved in GVHD in animals have shown that the gastrointestinal (GI) tract plays a major role in the amplification of systemic disease. Damage to the GI tract increases the translocation of inflammatory stimuli such as endotoxin, which promotes further inflammation and additional GI tract damage. The GI tract is therefore critical to the propagation of the ""cytokine storm"" characteristic of acute GVHD. Experimental approaches to the prevention of GVHD include reducing the damage to the GI tract by fortification of the GI mucosal barrier through novel ""cytokine shields"" such as IL-11 or keratinocyte growth factor. Such strategies have reduced GVHD while preserving a graft-versus-leukemia effect in animal models, and they now deserve formal testing in carefully designed clinical trials.

PML is delocalized from NBs in APL cells and is degraded in cells infected by several viruses. In these cells, NBs are disrupted, leading to the aberrant localization of NB proteins. These results have suggested a critical role for the NB in immune response and tumor suppression and raised the question of whether PML is crucial for the formation or stability of NB. In addition, PML is, among other proteins, covalently modified by SUMO-1. However, the functional relevance of this modification is unclear. Here, we show in primary PML(-/-) cells of various histologic origins, that in the absence of PML, several NB proteins such as Sp100, CBP, ISG20, Daxx, and SUMO-1 fail to accumulate in the NB and acquire aberrant localization patterns. Transfection of PML in PML(-/-) cells causes the relocalization of NB proteins. By contrast, a PML mutant that can no longer be modified by SUMO-1 fails to do so and displays an aberrant nuclear localization pattern. Therefore, PML is required for the proper formation of the NB. Conjugation to SUMO-1 is a prerequisite for PML to exert this function. These data shed new light on both the mechanisms underlying the formation of the NBs and the pathogenesis of APL.

Each TxRE contains nucleotide sequences corresponding to imperfect cyclic AMP response elements (CRE). In this study, we demonstrate that the bZIP transcriptional factor CREB-2 is able to bind in vitro to the TxREs and that CREB-2 binding to each of the 21-bp motifs is enhanced by Tax. We also demonstrate that Tax can weakly interact with CREB-2 bound to a cellular palindromic CRE motif such as that found in the somatostatin promoter. Mutagenesis of Tax and CREB-2 demonstrates that both N- and C-terminal domains of Tax and the C-terminal region of CREB-2 are required for direct interaction between the two proteins. In addition, the Tax mutant M47, defective for HTLV-1 activation, is unable to form in vitro a ternary complex with CREB-2 and TxRE.

We demonstrate that both TLS and the TLS-ERG leukemia fusion protein bind to RNA polymerase II through the TLS N-terminal domain, which is retained in the fusion protein; however, TLS recruits members of the serine-arginine (SR) family of splicing factors through its C-terminal domain, whereas the TLS-ERG fusion protein lacks the ability to recruit SR proteins due to replacement of the C-terminal domain by the fusion partner ERG. In transient-transfection assays, the TLS-ERG fusion protein inhibits E1A pre-mRNA splicing mediated by these TLS-associated SR proteins (TASR), and stable expression of the TLS-ERG fusion protein in K562 cells alters the splicing profile of CD44 mRNA.

Early detection and prompt therapy have the potential to reduce mortality. Leukemias, lymphomas and central nervous system tumors account for more than one half of new cancer cases in children. Early in the disease, leukemia may cause nonspecific symptoms similar to those of a viral infection. Leukemia should be suspected if persistent vague symptoms are accompanied by evidence of abnormal bleeding, bone pain, lymphadenopathy or hepatosplenomegaly. The presenting symptoms of a brain tumor may include elevated intracranial pressure, nerve abnormalities and seizures. A spinal tumor often presents with signs and symptoms of spinal cord compression. In children, lymphoma may present as one or more painless masses, often in the neck, accompanied by signs and symptoms resulting from local compression, as well as signs and symptoms of systemic disturbances, such as fever and weight loss. A neuroblastoma may arise from sympathetic nervous tissue anywhere in the body, but this tumor most often develops in the abdomen. The presentation depends on the local effects of the solid tumor and any metastases. An abdominal mass in a child may also be due to Wilms' tumor. This neoplasm may present with renal signs and symptoms, such as hypertension, hematuria and abdominal pain. A tumor of the musculoskeletal system is often first detected when trauma appears to cause pain and dysfunction out of proportion to the injury. Primary care physicians should be alert for possible presenting signs and symptoms of childhood malignancy, particularly in patients with Down syndrome or other congenital and familial conditions associated with an increased risk of cancer.","['Young, G', 'Toretsky, J A', 'Campbell, A B', 'Eskenazi, A E']","['Young G', 'Toretsky JA', 'Campbell AB', 'Eskenazi AE']","['University of Maryland School of Medicine, Baltimore 21201, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Am Fam Physician,American family physician,1272646,IM,"['Bone Neoplasms/diagnosis', 'Central Nervous System Neoplasms/diagnosis', 'Child', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Humans', 'Kidney Neoplasms/diagnosis', 'Leukemia/diagnosis', 'Lymphoma/diagnosis', 'Neoplasms/complications/*diagnosis', 'Neoplasms, Muscle Tissue/diagnosis', 'Neuroblastoma/diagnosis', 'Wilms Tumor/diagnosis']",2000/04/25 09:00,2000/05/20 09:00,['2000/04/25 09:00'],"['2000/04/25 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/05/20 09:00 [medline]', '2000/04/25 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Am Fam Physician. 2000 Apr 1;61(7):2144-54.,,18,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The observation that transfection of a GaLV envelope glycoprotein lacking an R peptide into human cells results in considerable cell-cell fusion and subsequent cell death prompted us to explore the potential for using this fusogenic membrane glycoprotein (FMG) as a targeted cytotoxic gene. As proof of principle, we therefore displayed epidermal growth factor (EGF) on the N terminus of GaLV envelope glycoproteins both with and without an R peptide (GaLV R+ and GaLV R-). Transfection of the GaLVR+ envelope expression plasmids did not cause cell-cell fusion. The GaLV R+ envelopes were incorporated into retroviral vectors whose infectivity was investigated on EGF receptor-positive and -negative cells. The vector incorporating an N-terminally unmodified envelope was able to infect all human cell lines tested. Infectivity of the vector incorporating an envelope on which EGF was displayed was restricted on EGF receptor-positive cells (but not on EGF receptor-negative cells) and could be restored by protease cleavage of the displayed domain or competition with exogenous ligand. The cell-cell fusion capacity of the GaLV R- envelope glycoproteins (N-terminally unmodified and with N-terminal display of both EGF and insulin-like growth factor I [IGF-I]) was investigated by plasmid DNA transfection. While the N-terminally unmodified GaLV R- fused all human cell types tested, fusogenicity of GaLV R- on which EGF or IGF-I was displayed was considerably restricted on receptor-positive cells. ""Reciprocal"" competition experiments showed that fusogenicity could be restored by competition only with the relevant exogenous ligand. Thus the specificity of cell-cell fusion by a hyperfusogenic GaLV envelope glycoprotein can be regulated by N-terminal display of growth factor ligands. There is therefore significant potential for further development of the targeting of the cell-killing capability of this fusogenic viral glycoprotein by using strategies similar to those we have developed for the targeting of retroviral vectors.","['Fielding, A K', 'Chapel-Fernandes, S', 'Chadwick, M P', 'Bullough, F J', 'Cosset, F L', 'Russell, S J']","['Fielding AK', 'Chapel-Fernandes S', 'Chadwick MP', 'Bullough FJ', 'Cosset FL', 'Russell SJ']","['Hematology and Molecular Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN 55902, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Hum Gene Ther,Human gene therapy,9008950,IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Cell Death', 'Cell Fusion', 'Epidermal Growth Factor/genetics/*metabolism', 'ErbB Receptors/metabolism', '*Gene Transfer Techniques', 'Genetic Vectors', 'Glycoproteins/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Insulin-Like Growth Factor I/genetics', 'Leukemia Virus, Gibbon Ape/*genetics', 'Ligands', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Oligopeptides/genetics', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/*genetics', 'Viral Envelope Proteins/*genetics']",2000/04/25 09:00,2000/07/08 11:00,['2000/04/25 09:00'],"['2000/04/25 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/07/08 11:00 [medline]', '2000/04/25 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1089/10430340050015437 [doi]'],ppublish,Hum Gene Ther. 2000 Apr 10;11(6):817-26. doi: 10.1089/10430340050015437.,"['0 (Glycoproteins)', '0 (Ligands)', '0 (Oligopeptides)', '0 (R peptide)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)', '62229-50-9 (Epidermal Growth Factor)', '67763-96-6 (Insulin-Like Growth Factor I)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (ErbB Receptors)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Several studies have been conducted on the efficacy and safety of different schedules of VP-16 both in adults and in children, but the optimal schedule has not been determined. METHODS: In the current study, the feasibility and effectiveness of prolonged oral VP-16 in children with high-risk malignancies were evaluated. Between April 1995 and February 1999, 15 pretreated patients with high-risk tumors received oral VP-16. The schedule of therapy was oral VP-16 50 mg/m2/day for 10 consecutive days and 1-week interval between cycles. Therapy was stopped after 1 year of treatment or at time of progressive disease or possible surgery. All patients had received parenteral VP-16 in their earlier chemotherapy. RESULTS: Twelve patients were evaluable for tumor response. After 2 to 4 months of treatment, one patient had complete remission (CR), two had partial response (PR), two had minor response (MR), two had mixed response (MxR), three had stable disease (SD), and two had progressive disease (PD). A useful palliative effect was noted in patients with stable disease. In three patients, oral VP-16 was administered for maintenance therapy. After an average follow-up of 27.5 months (range, 7-41 months), five patients are alive without disease (in three, total surgery was performed after VP-16 therapy) and three patients are alive with disease. Six patients died of progressive disease, and one died of promyelocytic leukemia. One patient had Grade 34 thrombocytopenia; in the remaining patients, no acute toxicity was observed during treatment. CONCLUSIONS: This schedule of oral VP-16 produced CRs, PRs, and MRs in medulloblastoma, neuroblastoma, teratocarcinoma, and ependymoma. Stable disease was observed in three patients, one with an Askin tumor, one with medulloblastoma, and one with hepatoblastoma. Given the possible leukemogenic risk, this schedule should be used as a palliative form of therapy or in patients with poor prognosis..","['Schiavetti, A', 'Varrasso, G', 'Maurizi, P', 'Cappelli, C', 'Clerico, A', 'Properzi, E', 'Castello, M A']","['Schiavetti A', 'Varrasso G', 'Maurizi P', 'Cappelli C', 'Clerico A', 'Properzi E', 'Castello MA']","['Department of Pediatrics, University La Sapienza, Rome, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article']",United States,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol,Journal of pediatric hematology/oncology,9505928,IM,"['Administration, Oral', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Disease Progression', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Etoposide/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/*drug therapy', 'Patient Compliance', 'Treatment Outcome']",2000/04/25 00:00,2000/04/25 00:01,['2000/04/25 00:00'],"['2000/04/25 00:00 [pubmed]', '2000/04/25 00:01 [medline]', '2000/04/25 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/00043426-200003000-00008 [doi]'],ppublish,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol. 2000 Mar-Apr;22(2):119-24. doi: 10.1097/00043426-200003000-00008.,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Double-staining immunohistochemistry with microtubule-associated protein-2 (MAP2), glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), lectin histochemistry, and interleukin (IL) 6 was also performed.

Definite LIF immunoreactivity was first detected after 12 hours of reperfusion in each of the brain regions examined: ischemic core, periinfarct region, and contralateral cortex. However, expression of LIF was most prominent in the periinfarct region at each time point, peaked at 24 hours, and then gradually declined until 96 hours of reperfusion. Some LIF-positive neurons in the periinfarct region expressed IL-6. At 96 hours of reperfusion, GFAP-labeled astrocytes around the infarct core also expressed LIF protein. Induction of LIF mRNA and protein was also confirmed by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and western blot analysis, respectively.

Overexpression of E2F-1 has been shown to induce apoptosis in several cancer cell types. In the present study, the effect of adenovirus-mediated E2F-1 overexpression on human esophageal cancer cell lines Yes-4 and Yes-6 was evaluated. Cells were treated by mock infection, infection with an adenoviral vector expressing beta-galactosidase (Ad5CMV-LacZ), or E2F-1 (Ad5CMVE2F-1). Western blot analysis confirmed marked overexpression of E2F-1 in Ad5CMVE2F-1-infected cells. Overexpression of E2F-1 resulted in marked growth inhibition and rapid loss of cell viability due to apoptosis, although Yes-6 cells were somewhat more resistant to E2F-1-mediated growth inhibition than Yes-4 cells. Cell cycle analysis revealed that overexpression of E2F-1 led to G2 arrest, followed by apoptotic cell death. p53 expression remained undetectable in both cell lines after E2F-1 overexpression. The apoptosis inhibitor proteins of the Bcl-2 gene family, Bcl-2, Mcl-1, and BcI-XL, decreased at 48 h after infection in Yes-4 cells, but remained unchanged in Yes-6 cells. Levels of retinoblastoma gene product (pRb) declined at 48 h after E2F-1 infection in Yes-4 cells, at which apoptosis predominated, whereas pRb expression remained constant in Yes-6 cells. Expression of p14ARF did not change after E2F-1 infection in either cell line. Involvement of caspase 3 and caspase 6 in E2F-1-mediated apoptosis was demonstrated by cleavage of caspase 3/CPP32 and poly-ADP-ribose polymerase, as well as fragmentation of the caspase 6 substrate, lamin B. These results indicate that the sensitivity of esophageal cancer cells to E2F-1-mediated apoptosis may be related to differential expression of Bcl-2 family member proteins and suggest that the adenovirus-mediated E2F-1 gene therapy may be a promising treatment strategy for the treatment of this disease.","['Yang, H L', 'Dong, Y B', 'Elliott, M J', 'Liu, T J', 'McMasters, K M']","['Yang HL', 'Dong YB', 'Elliott MJ', 'Liu TJ', 'McMasters KM']","['Department of Surgery, University of Louisville, James Graham Brown Cancer Center, Kentucky 40202, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,IM,"['Adenoviridae/genetics', '*Apoptosis', '*Carrier Proteins', 'Caspases/*metabolism', 'Cell Cycle', '*Cell Cycle Proteins', 'Cell Death', 'Cell Division', 'Cell Survival', 'DNA, Recombinant/genetics', '*DNA-Binding Proteins', 'E2F Transcription Factors', 'E2F1 Transcription Factor', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Esophageal Neoplasms/genetics/metabolism/*pathology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Genetic Vectors', 'Humans', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Neoplasm Proteins/biosynthesis', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*biosynthesis', 'Retinoblastoma Protein/biosynthesis', 'Retinoblastoma-Binding Protein 1', 'Transcription Factor DP1', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/*physiology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/genetics', 'bcl-X Protein']",2000/04/25 09:00,2000/08/06 11:00,['2000/04/25 09:00'],"['2000/04/25 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/08/06 11:00 [medline]', '2000/04/25 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2000 Apr;6(4):1579-89.,"['0 (BCL2L1 protein, human)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (DNA, Recombinant)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (E2F Transcription Factors)', '0 (E2F1 Transcription Factor)', '0 (E2F1 protein, human)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Retinoblastoma Protein)', '0 (Retinoblastoma-Binding Protein 1)', '0 (Transcription Factor DP1)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '0 (bcl-X Protein)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A new anti-CD22 recombinant immunotoxin RFB4(dsFv)-PE38, composed of the Fv portion of the monoclonal antibody RFB4 fused to a truncated form of Pseudomonas exotoxin A, is being developed to target CD22+ tumor cells. To explore the potential clinical utility of this recombinant toxin in treating patients with B-cell malignancies, the fresh cells of patients were incubated ex vivo with RFB4(dsFv)-PE38. Specific cytotoxicity was demonstrated in the malignant cells of 25 of 28 patients with a variety of B-cell malignancies, including acute and chronic lymphocytic leukemias and large cell, mantle cell, and follicular lymphomas. The IC50S, the concentrations necessary for 50% inhibition of protein synthesis, were 3-10 ng/ml in five patients and 10-50 ng/ml in seven patients. Cytotoxicity correlated with cell death upon direct examination of the malignant cells. Significant cytotoxicity was observed with cells containing as few as 350 CD22 sites/cell. A more active derivative of RFB4(dsFv)-PE38, RFB4(dsFv)-PE38KDEL, was produced and was slightly to more than 10-fold more cytotoxic toward patient cells and about twice as toxic to mice. Thus, RFB4(dsFv)-PE38 was specifically cytotoxic toward malignant cells from patients with B-cell leukemias. These data support the testing of RFB4(dsFv)-PE38 in patients with CD22+ leukemias and lymphomas, which is presently under way.","['Kreitman, R J', 'Margulies, I', 'Stetler-Stevenson, M', 'Wang, Q C', 'FitzGerald, D J', 'Pastan, I']","['Kreitman RJ', 'Margulies I', 'Stetler-Stevenson M', 'Wang QC', 'FitzGerald DJ', 'Pastan I']","['Laboratory of Molecular Biology, Division of Cancer Biology, National Cancer Institute, NIH, Bethesda, Maryland 20892, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/genetics/*pharmacology', 'Antibody Specificity', 'Antigens, CD/*immunology', 'Antigens, Differentiation, B-Lymphocyte/*immunology', 'Binding Sites', '*Cell Adhesion Molecules', 'Cell Death/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'DNA, Recombinant/genetics', 'Disulfides/chemistry', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Fragments/genetics/pharmacology', 'Immunotoxins/genetics/immunology/*pharmacology', 'Inhibitory Concentration 50', '*Lectins', 'Leukemia, B-Cell/*drug therapy/immunology/pathology', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/cytology/drug effects', 'Mutation', 'Plasmids', 'Protein Biosynthesis', 'Proteins/drug effects', 'Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 2', 'Time Factors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/cytology/drug effects']",2000/04/25 09:00,2000/08/06 11:00,['2000/04/25 09:00'],"['2000/04/25 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/08/06 11:00 [medline]', '2000/04/25 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2000 Apr;6(4):1476-87.,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, B-Lymphocyte)', '0 (CD22 protein, human)', '0 (Cell Adhesion Molecules)', '0 (DNA, Recombinant)', '0 (Disulfides)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Fragments)', '0 (Immunotoxins)', '0 (Lectins)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 2)', '0 (immunoglobulin Fv)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

High levels of BCL2 correlate with an adverse outcome when associated with favorable and intermediate prognosis cytogenetics (FIPC), whereas low levels portend an adverse outcome when associated with unfavorable cytogenetics (UC). Because BCL2 function can be modulated by dimerization with family members, like BAX, or by phosphorylation by protein kinase C alpha (PKCalpha), we hypothesize that the relative expression of these proteins in primary leukemic cells might alter the prognostic impact of BCL2 expression. We therefore measured BAX and PKCalpha protein levels in peripheral blood mononuclear cell lysates from 165 newly diagnosed AML patients and correlated the expression of these proteins with BCL2 expression, patient survival, and remission induction success. Expression levels of BAX and PKCalpha were normalized against a control cell line, K562. BAX and PKCalpha expression levels were heterogeneous and did not correlate with the percentage of blasts in the sample (R2 = 0.01 and <0.01). The median expression of both was similar across FAB groups but the range was greater for M4. A similar distribution of expression was observed in all cytogenetic groups, except that patients with inversion 16 demonstrated lower levels of BAX. Individually, neither PKCalpha nor BAX expression was prognostic of response to induction therapy or survival. A similar outcome was obtained when patients were stratified by cytogenetics into FIPC and UC groups. However, the ratio of either BCL2:BAX (B2:BX) or PKCalpha*B2:BX (PK*B2:BX) was highly prognostic. Patients with FIPC and a lower ratio (less than median) of either B2:BX or PK*B2:BX had a significantly higher remission induction rate (88 versus 69%, P = 0.04) and longer survival (median: 141 versus 80.5 weeks, P = 0.007) compared with those with ratios more than median. For patients with UC, values of either B2:BX or PK*B2:BX below the median had an inferior response rate to induction therapy (35 versus 78%, P = 0.0006) and inferior survival outcomes (median survival: 11 versus 53 weeks, P = 0.00002). Interestingly, FIPC and UC patients with antiapoptotic ratios (defined as B2:BX or PK*B2:BX more than median) had identical response rates and survival outcomes. In multivariate analyses, the compound variables of cytogenetics and B2:BX, or PK*B2:BX were independent predictors of survival. These results suggest that expression levels of proteins that affect the functional status of BCL2 modify the prognostic impact of BCL2 and suggest that the role of apoptosis in different cases of AML varies independently in the different cytogenetic subgroups.","['Kornblau, S M', 'Vu, H T', 'Ruvolo, P', 'Estrov, Z', ""O'Brien, S"", 'Cortes, J', 'Kantarjian, H', 'Andreeff, M', 'May, W S']","['Kornblau SM', 'Vu HT', 'Ruvolo P', 'Estrov Z', ""O'Brien S"", 'Cortes J', 'Kantarjian H', 'Andreeff M', 'May WS']","['Section of Molecular Hematology and Therapy, The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, 77030-4095, USA. skornblau@mdacc.tmc.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Apoptosis', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cytogenetic Analysis', 'Female', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Isoenzymes/metabolism', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*metabolism/pathology/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases/metabolism', 'Prognosis', 'Protein Kinase C/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*metabolism', 'Remission Induction', 'Survival Analysis', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein']",2000/04/25 09:00,2000/08/06 11:00,['2000/04/25 09:00'],"['2000/04/25 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/08/06 11:00 [medline]', '2000/04/25 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2000 Apr;6(4):1401-9.,"['0 (BAX protein, human)', '0 (Isoenzymes)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', 'EC 2.4.2.30 (Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)']",,,,['P01 55164-04/PHS HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The purine analogue 2-chlorodeoxyadenosine (2-CdA) exhibits enhanced activity in patients with hairy cell leukemia compared to those with CLL. Here we present a case report of a patient diagnosed with resistant CLL and treated sequentially with Bryo-1 followed by 2-CdA for three cycles. Molecular and biochemical parameters relative to the sequential treatment with these agents in vivo were comparable to those found in the WSU-CLL cell line in vitro (R. M. Mohammad et al., Clin. Cancer Res., 4: 445-453, 1998; R. M. Mohammad et al., Biol. Chem., 379: 1253-1261, 1998). There was a significant reduction of lymphocyte count from 37.1 x 10(3)/microl before the treatment to 3.4 x 10(3)/microl after treatment, and partial remission was achieved 2 months after the treatment. The percentage of morphologically differentiated lymphocytes was increased from 3% before treatment to 92% with the first cycle of Bryo-1. Similarly, expression of CD22, a marker of differentiation, increased from 38% to 97% and was maintained at a high level for the duration of the treatment. Analysis of the molecular markers of apoptosis in isolated peripheral blood lymphocytes revealed an increase in the Bax:Bcl-2 ratio after treatment with Bryo-1 in cycles 2 and 3, with associated poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase cleavage after Bryo-1 and 2-CdA treatment. The deoxycytidine kinase: cytosolic 5'-nucleotidase activity ratio increased modestly after Bryo-1 treatment, indicating increased sensitivity of the peripheral blood lymphocytes to 2-CdA. In summary, we found that sequential treatment with Bryo-1 and 2-CdA caused a significant reduction in peripheral blood lymphocytes (CLL cells) with simultaneous induction of differentiation and the initiation of the Bax: Bcl-2 apoptotic pathway.","['Ahmad, I', 'Al-Katib, A M', 'Beck, F W', 'Mohammad, R M']","['Ahmad I', 'Al-Katib AM', 'Beck FW', 'Mohammad RM']","['Department of Medicine, Karmanos Cancer Institute, Wayne State University School of Medicine, Detroit, Michigan 48201, USA.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,IM,"[""5'-Nucleotidase/drug effects/metabolism"", 'Aged', 'Antigens, CD/analysis', 'Antigens, Differentiation, B-Lymphocyte/analysis', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Blotting, Western', 'Bryostatins', '*Cell Adhesion Molecules', 'Cladribine/administration & dosage', 'Clinical Trials, Phase I as Topic', 'Deoxycytidine Kinase/drug effects/metabolism', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Integrin alphaXbeta2/analysis', 'Lactones/administration & dosage', '*Lectins', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy', 'Lymphocytes/cytology/drug effects/immunology', 'Macrolides', 'Male', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/drug effects/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/drug effects/metabolism', 'Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 2', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein']",2000/04/25 09:00,2000/08/06 11:00,['2000/04/25 09:00'],"['2000/04/25 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/08/06 11:00 [medline]', '2000/04/25 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2000 Apr;6(4):1328-32.,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, B-Lymphocyte)', '0 (BAX protein, human)', '0 (Bryostatins)', '0 (CD22 protein, human)', '0 (Cell Adhesion Molecules)', '0 (Integrin alphaXbeta2)', '0 (Lactones)', '0 (Lectins)', '0 (Macrolides)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 2)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', '37O2X55Y9E (bryostatin 1)', '47M74X9YT5 (Cladribine)', 'EC 2.7.1.74 (Deoxycytidine Kinase)', ""EC 3.1.3.5 (5'-Nucleotidase)""]",,,,"['CA79837/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30-CA22453-20/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We reported previously that in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL), p16 and p15 were frequently (approximately 70%) inactivated at the DNA level by deletion, mutation, or hypermethylation. Therefore, we hypothesize that inactivation of the cell cycle regulatory pathway may be essential in the pathogenesis of T-ALL, and that the remaining T-ALL with a wild-type p16/p15 gene likely harbor inactivation of these genes at RNA or protein levels. Alternatively, the downstream components of the pathway including CDK4/6, cyclin Ds, and pRb may be deregulated. In 124 primary T-ALLs, we found inactivation of the p16 and p15 genes at the DNA level in 79 (64%) and 64 (52%) samples, respectively. Only 9 of the 45 samples with wild-type p16 expressed p16 protein, whereas the remaining 36 lacked p16 expression at the RNA or protein level. In the 60 samples with an intact p15 gene, only 2 expressed p15 mRNA, and the only one analyzed lacked p15 protein. Overall, the abrogation rates for p16 and p15 at DNA/RNA/protein levels were 93% (115 of 124) and 99% (123 of 124), respectively. Although no alterations were evident in cyclin Ds or CDK4/6, pRb was hyperphosphorylated in the majority of samples investigated. These findings strongly support that both p16 and p15 are specific targets in the deregulation of the cell cycle pathway in T-ALL and that the inactivation of these genes is most likely essential in the pathogenesis of this disease.","['Omura-Minamisawa, M', 'Diccianni, M B', 'Batova, A', 'Chang, R C', 'Bridgeman, L J', 'Yu, J', 'Pullen, J', 'Bowman, W P', 'Yu, A L']","['Omura-Minamisawa M', 'Diccianni MB', 'Batova A', 'Chang RC', 'Bridgeman LJ', 'Yu J', 'Pullen J', 'Bowman WP', 'Yu AL']","['Department of Pediatrics/Hematology-Oncology, University of California, San Diego 92103, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,IM,"['Blotting, Western', 'Carrier Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Cell Cycle/genetics/physiology', '*Cell Cycle Proteins', 'Child', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p15', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p16/*genetics/metabolism', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', 'DNA, Neoplasm/chemistry/genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*genetics/metabolism', 'Mutation', 'Phosphorylation', 'Polymorphism, Single-Stranded Conformational', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'Retinoblastoma Protein/metabolism', '*Tumor Suppressor Proteins']",2000/04/25 09:00,2000/08/06 11:00,['2000/04/25 09:00'],"['2000/04/25 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/08/06 11:00 [medline]', '2000/04/25 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2000 Apr;6(4):1219-28.,"['0 (CDKN2B protein, human)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p15)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p16)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Retinoblastoma Protein)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)']",,,,"['CA70391/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA79951/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'LSA6124/SA/BHP HRSA HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: From 1991 to March 1998, a total of 27 consecutive Ph+ CML patients received busulfan 4 mg/kg/day over 4 days and cyclophosphamide 60 mg/kg/day over 2 days followed by infusion of HLA-identical sibling haematopoietic stem cells. All except one (who received peripheral blood stem cells) were given donor bone marrow cells. Post-transplant graft versus host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis included a short course of methotrexate (on days +1, +3, +6 and +11) and cyclosporine till day +180. RESULTS: With a median follow-up of 30.5 months (1-55+ months), 14 patients (52%) are alive free from relapse. Early mortality was relatively high with 10 patients (37%) dying within first 100 days post-transplant. Acute GVHD developed in 14 patients (52%) inspite of GVHD prophylaxis with methotrexate and cyclosporine; six had grade I/II and eight grade III/IV.

METHODS: The study was carried out in a total of 50 subjects (mean age 34 +/- 8.86 years; 25 were proved cases of CML and 25 were healthy controls. Vitamin E level was measured by spectrofluorometeric method. In patients of CML vitamin E level was estimated twice i.e. once when their total leucocyte count (TLC) was raised (i.e. before treatment) and then after treatment after bringing the TLC near normal. RESULTS: The mean serum vitamin E level in 25 normal healthy controls was 7.19 micrograms/ml and that in 25 patients of CML at presentation (before treatment) was 2.67 micrograms/ml. It increased to 3.61 micrograms/ml after treatment. CONCLUSION: The results show that patients of CML have a significantly lower (p < 0.001) level of serum vitamin E as compared to normal healthy adults and that the level of vitamin E increased significantly (p < 0.001) after treatment even without supplementing vitamin E.,"['Ghalaut, P S', 'Singh, V', 'Gupta, S']","['Ghalaut PS', 'Singh V', 'Gupta S']","['Dept of Medicine (Unit-VI) and Haematology, Pt BD Sharma Post Graduate Institute of Medical Sciences, Rohtak.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],India,J Assoc Physicians India,The Journal of the Association of Physicians of India,7505585,IM,"['Adult', 'Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating/therapeutic use', 'Busulfan/therapeutic use', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Humans', 'Hydroxyurea/therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*blood/*drug therapy', 'Spectrometry, Fluorescence', 'Vitamin E/*blood']",2000/04/25 09:00,2000/06/10 09:00,['2000/04/25 09:00'],"['2000/04/25 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/06/10 09:00 [medline]', '2000/04/25 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Assoc Physicians India. 1999 Jul;47(7):703-4.,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating)', '1406-18-4 (Vitamin E)', 'G1LN9045DK (Busulfan)', 'X6Q56QN5QC (Hydroxyurea)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Lipid peroxidation product malonyldialdehyde (MDA) was estimated in serum from 30 patients of leukaemia by thio-barbituric acid reaction before and after chemotherapy. There were 10 patients of acute myeloid leukaemia (AML), 5 with acute lymphocytic leukaemia (ALL), 15 with chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) of which 10 were in chronic stable phase and 5 in blast crisis. Twenty healthy age and sex matched individuals served as control. RESULTS: There was a significant increase in MDA levels in AML and ALL patients and serum MDA levels were higher in the active phase of disease than in remission. We observed a direct correlation between peripheral leucocyte counts and MDA levels. In CML, MDA levels were higher, more so in the patients who were in blast crisis. Patients of CML blast crisis who achieved remission showed a significant decrease in MDA levels as compared to those without remission. CONCLUSION: We observed a significant increase in MDA levels in active phase of acute as well as chronic leukaemia than those in remission. The proposed mechanism for high MDA is that myeloid cells are a major source of superoxide and other oxygen metabolites which lead to lipid peroxidation. MDA estimation in leukaemia can be of help in detecting type of leukaemia, response of therapy, and to predict the chances of relapse.","['Ghalaut, V S', 'Ghalaut, P S', 'Singh, S']","['Ghalaut VS', 'Ghalaut PS', 'Singh S']","['Dept of General Medicine, Pt BD Sharma PGIMS, Rohtak, Haryana, India.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],India,J Assoc Physicians India,The Journal of the Association of Physicians of India,7505585,IM,"['Case-Control Studies', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/diagnosis/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/diagnosis/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/diagnosis/metabolism', 'Lipid Peroxidation/*physiology', 'Male', 'Malondialdehyde/blood', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/diagnosis/metabolism', 'Predictive Value of Tests']",2000/04/25 09:00,2000/06/08 09:00,['2000/04/25 09:00'],"['2000/04/25 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/06/08 09:00 [medline]', '2000/04/25 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Assoc Physicians India. 1999 Apr;47(4):403-5.,['4Y8F71G49Q (Malondialdehyde)'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

RT-PCR analysis showed the existence of SNARE proteins, including syntaxin-2, -3, -4, SNAP-23, VAMP-2, and VAMP-7. Experiments using GFP-conjugated proteins revealed that VAMP-7 was localized only in granule membranes, whereas syntaxin-3 was in both the plasma and granule membranes.

Increases in both the synthesis and degradation of Topo I were previously shown to accompany phytohemagglutinin stimulation of proliferation in human peripheral T lymphocytes. The mechanism of this degradation of Topo I has now been investigated with both in vivo and in vitro assays. The activity of a nuclear protease that specifically degrades Topo I was induced in proliferating T lymphocytes. The full-length Topo I protein (100 kDa) was sequentially degraded to 97- and 82-kDa fragments both in vivo and in vitro. The initial site of proteolytic cleavage was mapped to the NH(2)-terminal region of the enzyme. The degradation of Topo I in vitro was inhibited by aprotinin or soybean trypsin inhibitor, suggesting that the enzyme responsible is a trypsin-like serine protease. Furthermore, Topo I degradation by this protease was Mg(2+)-dependent. The Topo I-specific protease activity induced during T lymphocytes proliferation was not detected in Jurkat (human T cell leukemia) cells and various other tested human cancer cell lines, possibly explaining why the abundance of Topo I is increased in tumor cells.","['Chen, H J', 'Hwong, C L', 'Wang, C H', 'Hwang, J']","['Chen HJ', 'Hwong CL', 'Wang CH', 'Hwang J']","['Institute of Biochemistry, School of Life Science, National Yang-Ming University, Taipei 112, Taiwan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,IM,"['Acetylcysteine/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Apyrase/pharmacology', 'Cell Division', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Nucleus/metabolism', 'Cysteine Proteinase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Cytosol/metabolism', 'DNA Topoisomerases, Type I/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Immunoblotting', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Magnesium/metabolism', 'Microfilament Proteins/metabolism', '*Muscle Proteins', 'Phytohemagglutinins/pharmacology', 'Protein Biosynthesis', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/metabolism', 'Serine Endopeptidases/*metabolism', 'T-Lymphocytes/cytology/*enzymology', 'Temperature', 'Trypsin/*metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/metabolism']",2000/04/25 09:00,2000/06/10 09:00,['2000/04/25 09:00'],"['2000/04/25 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/06/10 09:00 [medline]', '2000/04/25 09:00 [entrez]']","['10.1074/jbc.275.17.13109 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(19)83429-4 [pii]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2000 Apr 28;275(17):13109-17. doi: 10.1074/jbc.275.17.13109.,"['0 (Cysteine Proteinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Microfilament Proteins)', '0 (Muscle Proteins)', '0 (Phytohemagglutinins)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Tagln protein, mouse)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '133343-34-7 (lactacystin)', 'EC 3.4.21.- (Serine Endopeptidases)', 'EC 3.4.21.4 (Trypsin)', 'EC 3.6.1.5 (Apyrase)', 'EC 5.99.1.2 (DNA Topoisomerases, Type I)', 'I38ZP9992A (Magnesium)', 'WYQ7N0BPYC (Acetylcysteine)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Specific initiation of plus strand synthesis from this polypurine tract (PPT) RNA is essential for the subsequent integration of the linear viral DNA product. Based on current models, it is predicted that priming from sites upstream of the PPT may be tolerated by the virus, whereas efficient extension from RNA primers located downstream from the PPT is predicted to generate dead-end products. By using hybrid duplex substrates derived from the Moloney murine leukemia virus long terminal repeat, we investigated the extent to which RNase H degrades the viral RNA during time course cleavage assays, and we tested the capacity of the polymerase activity of RT to use the resulting cleavage products as primers. We find that the majority of the RNA fragments generated by RNase H are 2-25 nucleotides in length, and only following extensive degradation are most fragments reduced to 10 nucleotides or smaller. Although extensive RNA degradation by RNase H likely eliminates many potential RNA primers, based on thermostability predictions it appears that some RNA fragments remain stably annealed to the DNA template. RNA primers generated by RNase H within the long terminal repeat sequence are found to have the capacity to initiate DNA synthesis by RT; however, the priming efficiency is significantly less than that observed with the PPT primer.

Expression in antifolate-sensitive and -resistant human cell lines.,13012-6,"Folylpolyglutamate synthetase (FPGS) activity in CCRF-CEM human leukemia cells was found in the cytosolic ( approximately 67% of total) and mitochondrial ( approximately 22%) fractions. A polyclonal antipeptide antibody (430Ab) to human FPGS specifically recognized distinct immunoreactive bands ( approximately 60 kDa) present in each subcellular fraction. Human cytosolic FPGS (hcFPGS) migrated more rapidly than mitochondrial FPGS (hmFPGS); their estimated difference in molecular mass was 1 kDa. The human K562 acute nonlymphocytic leukemia and the A253 and FaDu head and neck cancer cell lines also expressed the two FPGS isoforms, and the ratio of hcFPGS to hmFPGS protein in each cell line was similar. Since K562 and A253 cells are intrinsically resistant to pulse methotrexate (MTX) exposure relative to CCRF-CEM and FaDu cells, respectively, because of decreased MTX polyglutamate synthesis (despite having similar levels of total FPGS activity expression), these data suggest that the natural difference in drug sensitivity cannot be explained by compartmentalization of FPGS activity. Higher expression of hmFPGS relative to hcFPGS was observed in some sublines of CCRF-CEM with acquired MTX resistance suggesting that differential expression of the hmFPGS isoform may contribute to MTX resistance caused by decreased FPGS activity.","['McGuire, J J', 'Russell, C A', 'Balinska, M']","['McGuire JJ', 'Russell CA', 'Balinska M']","['Grace Cancer Drug Center, Roswell Park Cancer Institute, Buffalo, New York 14263, USA. mcguire@sc3101.med.buffalo.edu']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,IM,"['Animals', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cattle', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Nucleus/enzymology', 'Cytosol/*enzymology', 'Electrophoresis', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Isoenzymes/chemistry', 'Methotrexate/pharmacology', 'Mitochondria/*enzymology', 'Peptide Synthases/*chemistry', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2000/04/25 09:00,2000/06/10 09:00,['2000/04/25 09:00'],"['2000/04/25 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/06/10 09:00 [medline]', '2000/04/25 09:00 [entrez]']","['10.1074/jbc.275.17.13012 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(19)83417-8 [pii]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2000 Apr 28;275(17):13012-6. doi: 10.1074/jbc.275.17.13012.,"['0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Isoenzymes)', 'EC 6.3.2.- (Peptide Synthases)', 'EC 6.3.2.17 (folylpolyglutamate synthetase)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",,,,"['CA16056/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA43500/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Usually AP site repair involves cleavage on the 5' side of the deoxyribose phosphate by AP endonuclease. Previous experiments suggested that DNA pol gamma acts to catalyze the removal of a 5'-deoxyribose phosphate (dRP) group in addition to playing the conventional role of a DNA polymerase. We confirm that DNA pol gamma is an active dRP lyase and show that other members of the family A of DNA polymerases including Escherichia coli DNA pol I also possess this activity. The dRP lyase reaction proceeds by formation of a covalent enzyme-DNA intermediate that is converted to an enzyme-dRP intermediate following elimination of the DNA. Both intermediates can be cross-linked with NaBH(4). For both DNA pol gamma and the Klenow fragment of pol I, the enzyme-dRP intermediate is extremely stable. This limits the overall catalytic rate of the dRP lyase, so that family A DNA polymerases, unlike pol beta, may only be able to act as dRP lyases in repair of AP sites when they occur at low frequency in DNA.","['Pinz, K G', 'Bogenhagen, D F']","['Pinz KG', 'Bogenhagen DF']","['Department of Pharmacological Sciences State University of New York at Stony Brook, Stony Brook, New York 11794-8651, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Carbon-Oxygen Lyases/*metabolism', 'Catalysis', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Chromatography, Ion Exchange', 'DNA Polymerase I/metabolism', 'DNA Polymerase gamma', 'DNA Repair', 'DNA-(Apurinic or Apyrimidinic Site) Lyase', 'DNA-Directed DNA Polymerase/*metabolism', 'Deoxyribonuclease IV (Phage T4-Induced)', '*Escherichia coli Proteins', 'Mitochondria/enzymology', 'Models, Chemical', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/enzymology', 'RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase/metabolism', 'Temperature', 'Time Factors']",2000/04/25 09:00,2000/06/10 09:00,['2000/04/25 09:00'],"['2000/04/25 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/06/10 09:00 [medline]', '2000/04/25 09:00 [entrez]']","['10.1074/jbc.275.17.12509 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(19)83351-3 [pii]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2000 Apr 28;275(17):12509-14. doi: 10.1074/jbc.275.17.12509.,"['0 (Escherichia coli Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.7.- (bacteriophage T7 induced DNA polymerase)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase)', 'EC 2.7.7.7 (DNA Polymerase I)', 'EC 2.7.7.7 (DNA Polymerase gamma)', 'EC 2.7.7.7 (DNA-Directed DNA Polymerase)', 'EC 3.1.21.2 (Deoxyribonuclease IV (Phage T4-Induced))', 'EC 3.1.21.2 (endonuclease IV, E coli)', 'EC 4.2.- (Carbon-Oxygen Lyases)', 'EC 4.2.99.18 (DNA-(Apurinic or Apyrimidinic Site) Lyase)']",,,,['P01-ES04068/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In a Burkitt lymphoma cell line, both types of agents likewise stimulated phosphorylation of myeloid cell leukemia 1 (MCL1), another viability-promoting BCL2 family member. However, while MCL1 phosphorylation induced by the protein kinase C activator, 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA), did not affect its electrophoretic mobility, microtubule-damaging agents, such as taxol, induced MCL1 phosphorylation associated with a band shift to decreased mobility. Inhibitors of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) activation blocked TPA-induced MCL1 phosphorylation but not the taxol-induced band shift. TPA-induced MCL1 phosphorylation occurred rapidly and was not associated with decreased viability, while the taxol-induced band shift occurred upon extended exposure as cells accumulated in G(2)/M followed by cell death.

The interaction of ENL and ABI1 could be verified in vitro by far-Western blot assays and GST-pulldown studies as well as in vivo by co-immunoprecipitation experiments. A structure-function analysis identified an internal region of ENL and a composite motif of ABI1 including an SH3 domain as mutual binding partners.

The drug is used to reduce the risk of life-threatening infection in patients with neutropenia, particularly after cytotoxic chemotherapy. Lenograstim accelerates neutrophil recovery significantly after chemotherapy, with beneficial effects on clinical end-points such as incidence of laboratory-confirmed infection and length of hospital stay. Chemotherapy dose intensity has also been increased in patients receiving lenograstim, notably those with breast or small cell lung cancer, although improvements in tumour response and survival have not been demonstrated. Lenograstim also assists neutrophil recovery in patients undergoing bone marrow transplantation, and stimulates the production of peripheral blood stem cells (PBSCs) for autologous transfusion after aggressive chemotherapy. Lenograstim also mobilises CD34+ cells more efficiently in unit dose terms than filgrastim and has been used successfully to mobilise PBSCs from healthy donors for allogeneic transplantation. Randomised trials have shown increases in rates of disease remission after lenograstim therapy in patients with acute myeloid leukaemia, with no evidence of stimulation of malignant blasts. The drug has also shown potential in the mobilisation of nonmalignant PBSCs for autotransplantation in patients with chronic myeloid leukaemia. Other studies show efficacy of lenograstim in patients with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia, aplastic anaemia, in children with severe chronic neutropenia and in the reversal of neutropenia related to antiviral therapy in patients with AIDS, although data are not extensive. Cost analyses of lenograstim have been carried out from a hospital perspective, although results have been inconclusive. Cost-effectiveness or cost-benefit data are lacking at present. Lenograstim is well tolerated, with bone pain and injection site reactions being reported most frequently in clinical trials. CONCLUSIONS: Lenograstim has been confirmed as a valuable adjunct to minimise the haematological toxicity of myelosuppressive chemotherapy in patients with malignant disease. The drug also enhances neutrophil recovery in patients undergoing stem cell rescue, and assists PBSC mobilisation. Data indicate clinical benefit with lenograstim in myeloid disorders, with no evidence of malignant blast cell proliferation. Further studies are required to assess more fully the pharmacoeconomic implications of the use of lenograstim and other recombinant growth factors, to provide more data on the efficacy of the drug in the management of disease-related neutropenia, and to clarify fully its position relative to filgrastim.","['Dunn, C J', 'Goa, K L']","['Dunn CJ', 'Goa KL']","['Adis International Limited, Mairangi Bay, Auckland, New Zealand. demail@adis.co.nz']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",New Zealand,Drugs,Drugs,7600076,IM,"['*Adjuvants, Immunologic/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*adverse effects', 'CHO Cells', 'Cricetinae', 'Economics, Pharmaceutical', '*Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Hematopoiesis', 'Humans', 'Lenograstim', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Neoplasms/*drug therapy', 'Neutropenia/*chemically induced/prevention & control', 'Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic', 'Recombinant Proteins/pharmacology/therapeutic use']",2000/04/25 09:00,2000/06/24 11:00,['2000/04/25 09:00'],"['2000/04/25 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/06/24 11:00 [medline]', '2000/04/25 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.2165/00003495-200059030-00017 [doi]'],ppublish,Drugs. 2000 Mar;59(3):681-717. doi: 10.2165/00003495-200059030-00017.,"['0 (Adjuvants, Immunologic)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '6WS4C399GB (Lenograstim)']",158,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We did a controlled study of psychosocial outcomes in adult survivors of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) and Wilms' tumour to address previous methods limitations. METHODS: We assessed 102 survivors of childhood ALL and Wilms' tumour, who had been free from relapse for 5 years and were aged 19-30 years, and 102 unrelated healthy controls. We used standard measures of adult psychiatric disorder, interpersonal and social-role performance, and intellectual ability to assess past and current functioning. FINDINGS: Cancer survivors had no increased rates of psychiatric disorder. Mean scores of cancer survivors were significantly higher (indicating poorer functioning) than those of controls for love/sex relationships (mean difference 0.87 [95% CI 0.53-1.22]), friendships (0.37 [0.07-0.67]), non-specific social contacts (0.40 [0.20-0.60]), and day-to-day coping (0.35 [0.14-0.57]). Cancer survivors were more likely than controls to have a combination of deficits in love/sex relationships and friendships (ALL survivors odds ratio 10.83 [95% CI 3.87-30.82], Wilms' tumour survivors 4.85 [1.43-16.47]), which was associated with more recent treatment (p=0.005). Poor coping was associated with lower intellectual ability scores (p=0.018). INTERPRETATION: Childhood ALL and Wilms' tumour have long-term effects on interpersonal functioning and coping, probably mediated by different mechanisms.

In a review of the literature we have identified 14 cases of APL in pregnancy treated with ATRA alone or in combination with chemotherapy. ATRA has been used as early as in the 3rd week of gestation and in no case have malformations or other teratogenic effects occurred. Side-effects, however, ranged from fetal cardiac arrhythmias to induction of labour. Although known to exhibit severe teratogenic effects during the first trimester of pregnancy, ATRA seems to be reasonably safe during the second and third trimesters in the treatment of APL.

The ratio of the absolute copy number of a target gene (AML1-ETO) to a control gene (glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, GAPDH) was calculated by using a fluorescence curve prepared from amplicons of serially diluted standard RNA. The relative points of MRD in bone marrow (BM) of 8 patients in the acute phase of the disease was from 0.85 to 3.0, whereas those of MRD in complete remission (CR) decreased to below 6.4 x 10(-3). This method was also applied to evaluate chimeric transcripts in peripheral blood (PB) samples. The values in patients with t(8;21) AML were from 0.97 to 2.0 in the acute phase, whereas those in CR showed less than 2.2 x 10(-4). There was 10(-5)-fold difference in AML1-ETO mRNA expression between PB samples in the acute phase and those in CR.

We have monitored changes in the growth factor signalling molecule MAPKinase, in the cytoprotective protein Bcl-2 and in the cell death protein Bax, during maturation of proliferating and non-proliferating AML blasts in vitro. Eighteen AML samples were cultured for 7 d in serum-free medium with or without a supplement of recombinant cytokines comprising c-kit ligand, IL3 and GMCSF. Maturation of AML blasts, as assessed by morphology on Romanowsky-stained slides of 7/18 samples and by changes in surface CD markers on all 18 leukemias, occurred in both the absence and presence of cytokines. Cell numbers decreased to a mean of 71% after 7 d of cytokine-free culture, but increased to 210% in cytokine-supplemented cultures. The proportion of CD15-positive cells, assessed by flow cytometry, increased over 7 d in 17/18 samples, from a mean of 22% to 68% in cytokine-free cultures and to 72% in cytokine-supplemented cultures (p = < 0.0001 for both). By immunofluorescence/flow cytometry, there was no significant change in Bcl-2 over 7 d of culture, while Bax increased, particularly in cytokine-free cultures (2.2-fold), which led to a significant decrease in the Bcl-2/Bax ratio. Immunoblotting demonstrated that ERK was briefly phosphorylated after seeding AML blasts into culture. PD98059, an inhibitor of MAPKinase kinase (MEK) which activates MAPKinase, inhibited this transient ERK phosphorylation but was unable to block maturation as measured by acquisition of CD15 in samples from 12 patients with low starting numbers of CD15-positive cells. PD98059, however, reduced cell numbers in 7-d liquid culture and, in cytokine-supplemented cultures, this was associated with a 1.3-fold increase in Bcl-2 (p = 0.012) and a 1.4-fold increase in Bax (p = 0.02). Overall, these data demonstrate that most leukemic populations can partially differentiate in vitro without the need for cytokines or inducers. The MAPKinase pathway is not required for this maturation, but it does maintain cell viability in the absence or presence of cytokines. A rise in Bcl-2 may not protect AML blasts in the face of elevated Bax.","['Baines, P', 'Fisher, J', 'Truran, L', 'Davies, E', 'Hallett, M', 'Hoy, T', 'Burnett, A K']","['Baines P', 'Fisher J', 'Truran L', 'Davies E', 'Hallett M', 'Hoy T', 'Burnett AK']","['Haematology Department, University Hospital of Wales and University of Wales College of Medicine, Cardiff, UK.

Upon phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) treatment, cells from the three lineages (HL-60, U937 and K562) differentiated and expressed specific surface antigens. All cell lines analyzed were growth inhibited by PMA and the doubling time was increased, mainly due to an increased fraction of cells in the G0/G1 phase, as determined by flow cytometry measurements of incorporated bromodeoxyuridine and cell DNA content. C-myc mRNA expression was down-regulated and closely correlated to cell growth arrest. However, VDR expression in leukemic cell lines, as determined by immunofluorescence and Northern blot assays, was not consistently changed upon inhibition of cell proliferation since VDR levels were down-regulated only in HL-60 cells.

Analysis of the immune responses elicited by direct DNA injection of pCMV-NL(Deltapol) and pAKV-NL(Deltapol) in macaques indicated that generation of the humoral and T-cell proliferative responses correlated directly with the promoter strength of the vaccine DNAs. In Macaca mulatta, pCMV-NL(Deltapol) generated stronger humoral responses and T-cell proliferative responses to Gag and Env using less DNA and fewer number of injections than pAKV-NL(Deltapol). Similarly, in Macaca nemestrina pCMV-NL(Deltapol) elicited high humoral responses, which persisted long-term and were boostable. Injection of large amounts of pAKV-NL(Deltapol), in general, failed to produce antibody levels comparable to pCMV-NL(Deltapol). However, injection of a control animal with large amounts of vector DNA produced a generalized enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) reactivity to HIV-1. The results indicated that generation of high immune responses to HIV-1 cannot be achieved by increasing the vaccine DNA dose and may require high protein expression from the DNA by including a strong promoter or by the use of other boosting agents. Furthermore, safety concerns may arise with increasing the DNA dose that could need additional investigation.","['Galvin, T A', 'Muller, J', 'Khan, A S']","['Galvin TA', 'Muller J', 'Khan AS']","['Laboratory of Retrovirus Research, Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, US Food and Drug Administration, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",Netherlands,Vaccine,Vaccine,8406899,IM,"['3T3 Cells', 'AIDS Vaccines/*immunology', 'AKR murine leukemia virus/*genetics', 'Animals', 'Antigens, Viral/*genetics', 'Base Sequence', 'Chloramphenicol O-Acetyltransferase/analysis', 'Chlorocebus aethiops', 'Cytomegalovirus/*genetics', 'Enhancer Elements, Genetic/genetics', 'Genes, Reporter', '*Genes, Viral', '*Genes, env', '*Genes, gag', 'HIV Antibodies/biosynthesis/immunology', 'HIV Core Protein p24/biosynthesis/*immunology', 'HIV Envelope Protein gp120/biosynthesis/*immunology', 'HIV Envelope Protein gp160/biosynthesis/immunology', 'HIV Envelope Protein gp41/biosynthesis/*immunology', 'HIV-1/genetics/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Immediate-Early Proteins/*genetics', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Macaca mulatta', 'Macaca nemestrina', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', '*Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/genetics/immunology', 'Rhabdomyosarcoma/pathology', 'Safety', 'Species Specificity', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/immunology', '*Terminal Repeat Sequences', 'Transfection', 'Vaccines, DNA/*immunology', 'Vero Cells']",2000/04/25 09:00,2000/08/29 11:01,['2000/04/25 09:00'],"['2000/04/25 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/08/29 11:01 [medline]', '2000/04/25 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0264-410X(99)00569-1 [pii]', '10.1016/s0264-410x(99)00569-1 [doi]']",ppublish,Vaccine. 2000 May 22;18(23):2566-83. doi: 10.1016/s0264-410x(99)00569-1.,"['0 (AIDS Vaccines)', '0 (Antigens, Viral)', '0 (HIV Antibodies)', '0 (HIV Core Protein p24)', '0 (HIV Envelope Protein gp120)', '0 (HIV Envelope Protein gp160)', '0 (HIV Envelope Protein gp41)', '0 (Immediate-Early Proteins)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Vaccines, DNA)', '0 (immediate-early proteins, cytomegalovirus)', 'EC 2.3.1.28 (Chloramphenicol O-Acetyltransferase)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The codon usage is particularly marked for the gag, pol, and env genes. Interestingly, the expression of these genes is dependent on the presence of the Rev/Rev-responsive element (RRE) regulatory system, even in contexts other than the HIV genome. The Rev dependency has been explained in part by the presence of RNA instability sequences residing in these coding regions. The requirement for Rev also places a limitation on the development of HIV-based vectors, because of the requirement to provide an accessory factor. We have now synthesized a complete codon-optimized HIV-1 gag-pol gene. We show that expression levels are high and that expression is Rev independent. This effect is due to an increase in the amount of gag-pol mRNA. Provision of the RRE in cis did not lower protein or RNA levels or stimulate a Rev response. Furthermore we have used this synthetic gag-pol gene to produce HIV vectors that now lack all of the accessory proteins. These vectors should now be safer than murine leukemia virus-based vectors.","['Kotsopoulou, E', 'Kim, V N', 'Kingsman, A J', 'Kingsman, S M', 'Mitrophanous, K A']","['Kotsopoulou E', 'Kim VN', 'Kingsman AJ', 'Kingsman SM', 'Mitrophanous KA']","['Retrovirus Molecular Biology Group, Department of Biochemistry, University of Oxford, Oxford OX1 3QU, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Nucleus/metabolism', 'Codon/*genetics', 'Cytoplasm/metabolism', 'Fusion Proteins, gag-pol/*genetics/metabolism', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes, env/genetics', 'Genes, gag/*genetics', 'Genes, pol/*genetics', '*Genetic Vectors', 'HIV-1/*genetics/physiology', 'Humans', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Trans-Activators/metabolism', 'Transduction, Genetic', 'Transfection']",2000/04/25 09:00,2000/05/16 09:00,['2000/04/25 09:00'],"['2000/04/25 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/05/16 09:00 [medline]', '2000/04/25 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/jvi.74.10.4839-4852.2000 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 2000 May;74(10):4839-52. doi: 10.1128/jvi.74.10.4839-4852.2000.,"['0 (Codon)', '0 (Fusion Proteins, gag-pol)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Trans-Activators)']",,PMC112007,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A mutant virus carrying a deletion of this sequence (Mo-MuLVDelta28) replicated more slowly than wild-type (wt) virus and reverted by recombination with endogenous sequences during growth in NIH 3T3 cells. We show that this deletion did not affect the level of viral protein expression or genomic RNA packaging. Mo-MuLVDelta28 served as a helper virus as efficiently as the wt virus; in contrast, a retroviral vector harboring this mutation exhibited reduced transduction efficiency, indicating that the mutation acts not in trans but in cis. Analysis of acutely infected cells revealed that reduced levels of viral DNA were generated by reverse transcription of the Mo-MuLVDelta28 RNA as compared to the wt RNA. Analysis of DNA circle junctions revealed that plus-strand DNA of Mo-MuLVDelta28 but not wt virus often retained the PPT and additional upstream sequences. These structures suggest that aberrant 5' ends of plus-strand DNA were generated by a failure to remove the PPT RNA primer and/or by mispriming at sites upstream of the PPT. These data demonstrate that the major role of the sequences immediately upstream of the PPT is specifying efficient and accurate plus-strand DNA synthesis.","['Bacharach, E', 'Gonsky, J', 'Lim, D', 'Goff, S P']","['Bacharach E', 'Gonsky J', 'Lim D', 'Goff SP']","['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biophysics, Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, New York 10032, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,IM,"['3T3 Cells', ""5' Untranslated Regions/genetics"", 'Animals', 'COS Cells', 'DNA, Viral/chemistry/*genetics/metabolism', 'Genes, env/genetics', 'Genome, Viral', 'Mice', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/*genetics/metabolism/pathogenicity', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Purines/*chemistry', 'RNA, Viral/metabolism', '*Sequence Deletion', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Untranslated Regions/*genetics', 'Virion/metabolism', 'Virus Replication']",2000/04/25 09:00,2000/05/16 09:00,['2000/04/25 09:00'],"['2000/04/25 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/05/16 09:00 [medline]', '2000/04/25 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/jvi.74.10.4755-4764.2000 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 2000 May;74(10):4755-64. doi: 10.1128/jvi.74.10.4755-4764.2000.,"[""0 (5' Untranslated Regions)"", '0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (Purines)', '0 (RNA, Viral)', '0 (Untranslated Regions)']",,PMC111998,,"['R01 CA030488/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA 30488/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Other than sheep, JSRV is known to infect goats, but there is no evidence of human infection. Until now it has not been possible to study the host range for JSRV because of the inability to grow this virus in culture. Here we show that the JSRV envelope protein (Env) can be used to pseudotype Moloney murine leukemia virus (MoMLV)-based retrovirus vectors and that such vectors can transduce human cells in culture. We constructed hybrid retrovirus packaging cells that express the JSRV Env and the MoMLV Gag-Pol proteins and can produce JSRV-pseudotype vectors at titers of up to 10(6) alkaline phosphatase-positive focus-forming units/ml. Using this high-titer virus, we have studied the host range for JSRV, which includes sheep, human, monkey, bovine, dog, and rabbit cells but not mouse, rat, or hamster cells. Considering the inability of the JSRV-pseudotype vector to transduce hamster cells, we used the hamster cell line-based Stanford G3 panel of whole human genome radiation hybrids to phenotypically map the JSRV receptor (JVR) gene within the p21.3 region of human chromosome 3. JVR is likely a new retrovirus receptor, as none of the previously identified retrovirus receptors localizes to the same position. Several chemokine receptors that have been shown to serve as coreceptors for lentivirus infection are clustered in the same region of chromosome 3; however, careful examination shows that the JSRV receptor does not colocalize with any of these genes.","['Rai, S K', 'DeMartini, J C', 'Miller, A D']","['Rai SK', 'DeMartini JC', 'Miller AD']","['Division of Human Biology, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, Washington 98109, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,IM,"['Animals', 'Betaretrovirus/*genetics/metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Chromosome Mapping', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 3', 'Genetic Vectors', 'Humans', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/*genetics', 'Pulmonary Adenomatosis, Ovine/virology', 'Receptors, Virus/*genetics', 'Retroviridae Infections/veterinary/virology', 'Sheep', '*Transduction, Genetic', 'Viral Envelope Proteins/*genetics']",2000/04/25 09:00,2000/05/16 09:00,['2000/04/25 09:00'],"['2000/04/25 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/05/16 09:00 [medline]', '2000/04/25 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/jvi.74.10.4698-4704.2000 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 2000 May;74(10):4698-704. doi: 10.1128/jvi.74.10.4698-4704.2000.,"['0 (Receptors, Virus)', '0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)']",,PMC111991,,"['P30 DK047754/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'HL54881/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA59116/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'DK47754/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'P50 HL054881/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These phenomena hamper the use of recombinant retroviruses as stable gene delivery vectors. As insulators are able to block promoter-enhancer interactions and reduce position effects in some transgenic animals, we examined the effect of an insulator on the expression and structure of randomly integrated recombinant retroviruses. We used the cHS4 element, an insulator from the chicken beta-like globin gene cluster, which has been shown to reduce position effects in transgenic Drosophila. A large panel of mouse erythroleukemia cells that bear a single copy of integrated recombinant retroviruses was generated without using drug selection. We show that the cHS4 increases the probability that integrated proviruses will express and dramatically decreases the level of de novo methylation of the 5' long terminal repeat. These findings support a primary role of methylation in the silencing of retroviruses and suggest that cHS4 could be useful in gene therapy applications to overcome silencing of retroviral vectors.","['Rivella, S', 'Callegari, J A', 'May, C', 'Tan, C W', 'Sadelain, M']","['Rivella S', 'Callegari JA', 'May C', 'Tan CW', 'Sadelain M']","['Department of Human Genetics, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York 10021, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,IM,"[""3' Untranslated Regions/genetics"", '3T3 Cells', ""5' Untranslated Regions/genetics"", 'Animals', 'Cell Line', 'DNA Methylation', 'Deoxyribonuclease I/metabolism', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Gene Silencing', 'Gene Transfer Techniques', '*Genetic Vectors', 'Globins/genetics', 'Mice', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/*genetics/physiology', '*Regulatory Sequences, Nucleic Acid', 'Terminal Repeat Sequences', 'Transgenes', 'Viral Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', '*Virus Integration', 'Virus Replication']",2000/04/25 09:00,2000/05/16 09:00,['2000/04/25 09:00'],"['2000/04/25 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/05/16 09:00 [medline]', '2000/04/25 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/jvi.74.10.4679-4687.2000 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 2000 May;74(10):4679-87. doi: 10.1128/jvi.74.10.4679-4687.2000.,"[""0 (3' Untranslated Regions)"", ""0 (5' Untranslated Regions)"", '0 (Viral Proteins)', '9004-22-2 (Globins)', 'EC 3.1.21.1 (Deoxyribonuclease I)']",,PMC111989,,"['P01 CA059350/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL057612/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA-59350/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL57612/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although the enzymatic activity of this molecule is absolutely required for transformation, other regions of the protein are also important for this response. Among these are the SH2 domain, involved in phosphotyrosine-dependent protein-protein interactions, and the long carboxyl terminus, which plays an important role in transformation of hematopoietic cells. Important signals are sent from each of these regions, and transformation is most likely orchestrated by the concerted action of these different parts of the protein. To explore this idea, we compared the ability of the v-Src SH2 domain to substitute for that of v-Abl in the full-length P120 v-Abl protein and in P70 v-Abl, a protein that lacks the carboxyl terminus characteristic of Abl family members. Ab-MLV strains expressing P70/S2 failed to transform NIH 3T3 cells and demonstrated a greatly reduced capacity to mediate signaling events associated with the Ras-dependent mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase pathway. In contrast, Ab-MLV strains expressing P120/S2 were indistinguishable from P120 with respect to these features. Analyses of additional mutants demonstrated that the last 162 amino acids of the carboxyl terminus were sufficient to restore transformation. These data demonstrate that an SH2 domain with v-Abl substrate specificity is required for NIH 3T3 transformation in the absence of the carboxyl terminus and suggest that cooperativity between the extreme carboxyl terminus and the SH2 domain facilitates the transmission of transforming signals via the MAP kinase pathway.","['Warren, D', 'Heilpern, A J', 'Berg, K', 'Rosenberg, N']","['Warren D', 'Heilpern AJ', 'Berg K', 'Rosenberg N']","['Department of Molecular Biology and Microbiology, Tufts University School of Medicine, Boston, Massachusetts 02111, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,IM,"['3T3 Cells', 'Abelson murine leukemia virus/chemistry/genetics/*physiology', '*Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing', '*Adaptor Proteins, Vesicular Transport', 'Animals', 'Cell Line', '*Cell Transformation, Viral', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/metabolism', 'Enzyme Activation', '*Fungal Proteins', 'GATA Transcription Factors', 'GRB2 Adaptor Protein', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Viral', 'Genes, fos', 'Genetic Complementation Test', 'Humans', 'JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases', 'Mice', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/metabolism', 'Oncogene Proteins v-abl/*chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/metabolism', 'Shc Signaling Adaptor Proteins', 'Src Homology 2 Domain-Containing, Transforming Protein 1', 'ras Proteins/metabolism', '*src Homology Domains/genetics']",2000/04/25 09:00,2000/05/16 09:00,['2000/04/25 09:00'],"['2000/04/25 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/05/16 09:00 [medline]', '2000/04/25 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/jvi.74.10.4495-4504.2000 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 2000 May;74(10):4495-504. doi: 10.1128/jvi.74.10.4495-4504.2000.,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (Adaptor Proteins, Vesicular Transport)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Fungal Proteins)', '0 (GATA Transcription Factors)', '0 (GRB2 Adaptor Protein)', '0 (GRB2 protein, human)', '0 (Grb2 protein, mouse)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins v-abl)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (SHC1 protein, human)', '0 (Shc Signaling Adaptor Proteins)', '0 (Shc1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Src Homology 2 Domain-Containing, Transforming Protein 1)', '0 (Sre protein, Neurospora crassa)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (ras Proteins)']",,PMC111963,,"['T35 HL007785/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA22440/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T35 HL07785/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, there are relatively few reports concerning cell differentiation being mediated by MAPK. The effect of phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) on cell differentiation and signal transduction in a human myeloid leukemia cell line, TF-1a, was investigated. When TF-1a cells were treated with 10(-6), 10(-7), 10(-8), and 10(-9) M PMA for 24 h, they underwent 98, 93, 91, and 51% macrophage-like differentiation, respectively. PMA treatment rapidly (10 min) induced phosphorylation of MAPK kinase (MEK and p44/42 MAPK), which persisted for at least 24 h. p44/42 MAPK immunoprecipitates from lysates of PMA-treated cells had increased ability to phosphorylate the transcription factor Elk-1. This is important because phosphorylated Elk-1 can be considered an ""end-product"" of the MAPK pathway. In contrast, treatment of TF-1a cells with granulocyte/macrophage-colony stimulating factor induced only transient activation of MEK and p44/42 MAPK (10-20 min) and an increase (approximately 50%) in cell proliferation, without any change in cellular differentiation. These results suggest that macrophage-like differentiation may be dependent on prolonged activation of the MAPK pathway. Additional support for this conclusion was obtained from experiments showing that treatment of TF-1a cells with antisense oligonucleotides for MEK1 coding sequences prior to adding PMA inhibited macrophage-like differentiation. Furthermore, transient transfection with an inactive, dominant-negative MEK mutant also inhibited PMA-induced differentiation, whereas transient transfection with a plasmid coding for constitutively activated MEK led to macrophage-like differentiation in the absence of PMA.","['Hu, X', 'Moscinski, L C', 'Valkov, N I', 'Fisher, A B', 'Hill, B J', 'Zuckerman, K S']","['Hu X', 'Moscinski LC', 'Valkov NI', 'Fisher AB', 'Hill BJ', 'Zuckerman KS']","['Department of Internal Medicine, University of South Florida and H.

We established a nested-reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (nested-RT-PCR) technique for the detection of the TEL-AML1 transcript, and used this to investigate the incidence of the rearrangement, and to characterize the disease present in TEL-AML1-positive B-lineage ALL patients. The TEL-AML1 fusion transcript was detected in nine of fourteen patients.

Furthermore, we could detect the TEL-AML1 transcript in the peripheral blood of t(12;21)-positive patients and we used this to assess minimal residual disease (MRD) in patients during chemotherapy.

For this, PQ-resistant AML sublines, AML-2/PQ100 and AML-2/PQ400, were selected in the presence of PQ concentrations of 100 microg/ml and 400 microg/ml, respectively. They showed a moderate level of cross resistance to cisplatin and doxorubicin. They were also slightly more resistant than the parental cell (AML-2/WT) to etoposide, camptothecin and daunorubicin. The resistance of PQ-resistant AML-2 sublines to cisplatin seemed to be due to increased amounts of metallothionein, which was not only supported by reversal of resistance to cisplatin by propargylglycin (an inhibitor of metallothionein synthesis) but also confirmed by Western blot analysis and reverse transcription-PCR assay. In addition, both AML-PQ100 and /PQ400 sublines showed increased activities of Cu-, Zn-containing superoxide dismutase (Cu,Zn-SOD) and Mn-containing superoxide dismutase (Mn-SOD), whereas AML-2/PQ400, but not AML-2/PQ100, showed increased glutathione S-transferase activity as compared to that of AML-2/WT. However, there was no difference in other ROS-related cellular antioxidants between AML-2/WT and its PQ-resistant sublines. Taken together, these results strongly suggest that increases in levels of metallothionein, glutathione S-transferase, Cu,Zn-SOD and Mn-SOD play important roles in protective mechanisms against toxicity of PQ or ROS in AML cells.","['Choi, C H', 'Kim, H S', 'Kweon, O S', 'Lee, T B', 'You, H J', 'Rha, H S', 'Jeong, J H', 'Lim, D Y', 'Min, Y D', 'Kim, M S', 'Chung, M H']","['Choi CH', 'Kim HS', 'Kweon OS', 'Lee TB', 'You HJ', 'Rha HS', 'Jeong JH', 'Lim DY', 'Min YD', 'Kim MS', 'Chung MH']","['Department of Pharmacology, Chosun University Medical School, Kwangju, Korea. chchoi@mail.chosun.ac.kr']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Korea (South),Mol Cells,Molecules and cells,9610936,IM,"['Alkynes/pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Camptothecin/pharmacology', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cisplatin/pharmacology', 'Daunorubicin/pharmacology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Doxorubicin/pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance, Multiple', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Etoposide/pharmacology', 'Glutathione Transferase/metabolism', 'Glycine/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/*metabolism/pathology', 'Metallothionein/metabolism', 'Paraquat/*pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/*metabolism', 'Superoxide Dismutase/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Vincristine/pharmacology']",2000/04/25 09:00,2000/07/06 11:00,['2000/04/25 09:00'],"['2000/04/25 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/07/06 11:00 [medline]', '2000/04/25 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s10059-000-0038-0 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Cells. 2000 Feb 29;10(1):38-46. doi: 10.1007/s10059-000-0038-0.,"['0 (Alkynes)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '64165-64-6 (propargylglycine)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', '9038-94-2 (Metallothionein)', 'EC 1.15.1.1 (Superoxide Dismutase)', 'EC 2.5.1.18 (Glutathione Transferase)', 'PLG39H7695 (Paraquat)', 'Q20Q21Q62J (Cisplatin)', 'TE7660XO1C (Glycine)', 'XT3Z54Z28A (Camptothecin)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This prompted us to perform both assays in parallel to monitor a group of APL. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The study included 56 APL patients mainly treated according with the PETHEMA LPA-96 protocol. The PML/RAR alpha was detected according with Biondi's et al method and the RAR alpha/PML following the Grimwade's et al RT-PCR method (Human Press Inc.). RESULTS: RAR alpha/PML rearrangement was detected in 90% (20/22) of the patients at diagnosis positives for PML/RAR alpha. RAR alpha/PML was detected in 74% (14/19) of post-induction samples versus 37% (7/19) of positives for PML/RAR alpha. Likewise RAR alpha/PML rearrangement was detected in some post-consolidation samples (2/11) that all were PMI/RAR alpha negatives. In patients in maintenance regimen a greater proportion of RAR alpha/PML positives (6/28) versus PML/RAR alpha (2/28) were observed. In a patient in complete remission RAR alpha/PML preceded the positivity of PML/RAR alpha and persisted after PMI/RAR alpha negativization. The results of the patients monitored since the diagnosis showed that RAR alpha/PML revert to negative one month after PML/RAR alpha negativization. CONCLUSIONS: RAR alpha/PML rearrangement is not expressed in the totality of the APL patients, but in only a 90% of them. RAR alpha/PML rearrangement was detected in a greater proportion of samples than PML/RAR alpha. RAR alpha/PML rearrangement lasted longer than PML/RAR alpha after treatment.","['Bolufer, P', 'Barragan, E', 'Sanz, M A', 'Martin, G', 'Lerma, E', 'Afan de Ribera, E']","['Bolufer P', 'Barragan E', 'Sanz MA', 'Martin G', 'Lerma E', 'Afan de Ribera E']","['Departamento de Biopatologia Clinica, Hospital Universitario La Fe, Valencia. boluferpas@gva.es']",['spa'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Spain,Med Clin (Barc),Medicina clinica,0376377,IM,"['Gene Rearrangement/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*genetics', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*genetics', 'Neoplasm, Residual', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*genetics', 'Sensitivity and Specificity']",2000/04/25 09:00,2000/06/08 09:00,['2000/04/25 09:00'],"['2000/04/25 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/06/08 09:00 [medline]', '2000/04/25 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0025-7753(00)71270-X [pii]', '10.1016/s0025-7753(00)71270-x [doi]']",ppublish,Med Clin (Barc). 2000 Mar 4;114(8):281-5. doi: 10.1016/s0025-7753(00)71270-x.,"['0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (promyelocytic leukemia-retinoic acid receptor alpha fusion oncoprotein)']",,,,,,,,Monitorizacion de la enfermedad minima residual mediante deteccion conjunta de los reordenamientos PML/RAR alpha y RAR alpha/PML en la leucemia promielocitica aguda.,,,,,,,,,,,,

Prevention is better than cure. Recent studies into the causes of childhood malignancy are reviewed. The incidence of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) is steadily increasing. The cause for this may be increasing social and economic development. Exposure to electromagnetic fields has been a cause of concern for almost 20 years. A recent large case control study has shown no increased risk of cancer or leukaemia in those who have measurably increased exposure to electromagnetic fields. Leukaemia which has the cytogenetic abnormality 11q23 or MLL gene rearrangement characteristically occurs as a second malignancy after exposure to epipodophyllotoxins which act by inhibiting topoisomerase. Infant leukaemia has the same cytogenetic profile. Mothers of babies who develop infant leukaemia have high exposure to potential dietary inhibitors of topoisomerase during pregnancy. Clusters of leukaemia can probably best be accounted for by population mixing.

A newborn girl presented with widespread dusky red and yellowish cutaneous nodules and papules. Bone marrow morphology was consistent with the diagnosis of acute monocytic leukemia of the FAB M5 type. Skin biopsy specimens confirmed the presence of a leukemic infiltrate and revealed calcium salt deposition in the papillary and reticular dermis. Calcinosis was diffuse in the whole skin but spared other organs. Vascular calcification was not present. Serum calcium levels oscillated between 2.5 and 2.86 mmol/l, and phosphorus, parathyroid hormone and 25-hydroxyvitamin D(3) levels were normal. There were diffuse osteoporosis and spontaneous fractures of small tubular bones. The patient responded to chemotherapy but, following consolidation treatment, developed sepsis and died at 120 days of age. Congenital leukemia is rare and LC is uncommon. Hypercalcemia may be a complication of leukemia, which leads to multiorgan metastatic calcification. Despite the absence of frank hypercalcemia, the presence of bone lesions suggests that the patient's calcinosis cutis was of the metastatic type.

Different transcriptional and post-transcriptional mechanisms were found to contribute to the heterogeneity of the chimeric transcripts. Multiple splice variants are generated by utilizing alternative splice sites that result in the joining of different MLL-exons within the breakpoint cluster region to one of three exons in the AF4 fusion partner. To address the question of how splice site selection occurs during RNA processing, we investigated der(11) transcripts in 10 infants with t(4;11) positive ALL. Specific RT-PCR products were analyzed by Southern blot hybridization, SSCP, endonuclease digestion, cloning and sequencing. In patients co-expressing as many as six different chimeric mRNA species, activation of cryptic splice sites has been detected in MLL-exons 8 and 10. This led to the formation of four novel transcript variants, three of which maintained open reading frames (ORFs). Patients with cryptic donor site activation in MLL-exon 8 did not have any MLL-exon 8/AF4 transcripts using the authentic 5' splice site, although this site is 100% homologous to the consensus sequence. However, since MLL-exon 8 does not end in-phase, the use of the authentic splice site would result in loss of the ORF of the fusion message. The activated cryptic splicing sites are located in the vicinity of the polypurine stretches present in MLL-exons 8 and 10, which are known to function as splicing enhancers recognized by SR proteins. We postulate that both the nonsense-mediated decay eliminating correctly spliced MLL-exon 8/AF4 mRNAs and activation of suboptimal splicing sites contribute to the diversity of MLL/AF4 RNA species.","['Divoky, V', 'Trka, J M', 'Watzinger, F', 'Lion, T']","['Divoky V', 'Trka JM', 'Watzinger F', 'Lion T']","[""Children's Cancer Research Institute (CCRI), St. Anna Children's Hospital, Kinderspitalgasse 6, A-1090, Wien, Austria.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Gene,Gene,7706761,IM,"['Alternative Splicing/*genetics', 'Binding Sites', 'Chromosome Breakage', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 11/*genetics', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 4/*genetics', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics', 'Exons', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Genetic Heterogeneity', 'Genetic Variation', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Introns', 'Mutation', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*genetics', 'Open Reading Frames', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics', '*Proto-Oncogenes', 'RNA Processing, Post-Transcriptional', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', '*Transcription Factors', 'Transcription, Genetic', '*Translocation, Genetic', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2000/04/25 09:00,2000/07/15 11:00,['2000/04/25 09:00'],"['2000/04/25 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/07/15 11:00 [medline]', '2000/04/25 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0378-1119(00)00111-6 [pii]', '10.1016/s0378-1119(00)00111-6 [doi]']",ppublish,Gene. 2000 Apr 18;247(1-2):111-8. doi: 10.1016/s0378-1119(00)00111-6.,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (KMT2A protein, human)', '0 (MLL-AF4 fusion protein, human)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These results suggest that activin promotes astrocyte differentiation of CNS neural progenitors, and the competence to activin is different between multipotent stem cells and unipotent astrocyte progenitor cells.","['Satoh, M', 'Sugino, H', 'Yoshida, T']","['Satoh M', 'Sugino H', 'Yoshida T']","['Animal Cell Bank, Institute for Fermentation, Osaka (IFO), 2-17-85 Juso-honmachi, Yodogawa-ku, Osaka, Japan. satoh-motonobu@ifo.or.jp']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Ireland,Neurosci Lett,Neuroscience letters,7600130,IM,"['Activin Receptors, Type I', 'Activin Receptors, Type II', 'Activins', 'Animals', 'Astrocytes/cytology/*drug effects', 'Cell Differentiation/*drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Central Nervous System/*cytology/drug effects', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics', 'Glial Fibrillary Acidic Protein/metabolism', 'Growth Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Inhibins/*pharmacology', '*Interleukin-6', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Lymphokines/pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C3H', 'Neurons/cytology/*drug effects', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis/genetics', 'Receptors, Growth Factor/genetics', 'Smad2 Protein', 'Smad3 Protein', 'Smad4 Protein', 'Stem Cells/cytology/*drug effects', 'Trans-Activators/genetics']",2000/04/25 09:00,2000/06/17 09:00,['2000/04/25 09:00'],"['2000/04/25 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/06/17 09:00 [medline]', '2000/04/25 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0304394000009812 [pii]', '10.1016/s0304-3940(00)00981-2 [doi]']",ppublish,Neurosci Lett. 2000 Apr 28;284(3):143-6. doi: 10.1016/s0304-3940(00)00981-2.,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Glial Fibrillary Acidic Protein)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Growth Factor)', '0 (Smad2 Protein)', '0 (Smad2 protein, mouse)', '0 (Smad3 Protein)', '0 (Smad3 protein, mouse)', '0 (Smad4 Protein)', '0 (Smad4 protein, mouse)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '104625-48-1 (Activins)', '57285-09-3 (Inhibins)', 'EC 2.7.11.30 (Activin Receptors, Type I)', 'EC 2.7.11.30 (Activin Receptors, Type II)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Poly(ethylene carbonate) is a new polymer of high molecular weight (MW) and forms polymer matrices that are exclusively surface bioerodible. In the frame of this study, the influence of the polymer molecular weight and the polymer concentration in the organic phase on the physico-chemical characteristics of the microspheres were investigated. Ninety percent of the microspheres had a diameter ranging between 4 and 136 microm, with a mean value of 30 microm. The encapsulation ratios ranged from 2.22 to 2.51% (w/w) depending on the molecular weight of the polymer corresponding to an encapsulation efficiency of 70 to 100%, respectively. Independent of the polymer molecular weight used, the in vitro drug release was very low, ranging from 5.61 to less than 1% of the total encapsulated GM-CSF amount. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analysis showed microparticles with spherical shapes and smooth surfaces containing a few small globules. The inner structure of the microspheres appeared to consist of a polymeric matrix surrounding numerous globules. These globules have different sizes, shape and distribution in the polymeric matrix, depending on the concentration of the polymer solution and on the polymer molecular weight. In addition, it was demonstrated that the GM-CSF lowered the interfacial tension between the GM-CSF aqueous solution and the methylene chloride organic phase. The active critical concentration was as low as 0.008 mg/ml. It was therefore suggested that this particular behavior contributed to the stabilization of the primary emulsion during the formation of the microspheres, leading to rather high encapsulation efficiency.","['Lambert, O', 'Nagele, O', 'Loux, V', 'Bonny, J D', 'Marchal-Heussler, L']","['Lambert O', 'Nagele O', 'Loux V', 'Bonny JD', 'Marchal-Heussler L']","['Novartis Pharma AG, Pharmaceutical Development, CH-4002, Basel, Switzerland.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Netherlands,J Control Release,Journal of controlled release : official journal of the Controlled Release Society,8607908,IM,"['Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Drug Compounding', 'Drug Stability', 'Emulsions', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/*administration & dosage/chemistry/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/blood', 'Microspheres', 'Molecular Weight', 'Particle Size', 'Polyethylenes/*chemistry', 'Solutions', 'Surface Tension', 'Viscosity']",2000/04/25 09:00,2000/07/08 11:00,['2000/04/25 09:00'],"['2000/04/25 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/07/08 11:00 [medline]', '2000/04/25 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0168-3659(00)00198-X [pii]', '10.1016/s0168-3659(00)00198-x [doi]']",ppublish,J Control Release. 2000 Jun 15;67(1):89-99. doi: 10.1016/s0168-3659(00)00198-x.,"['0 (Emulsions)', '0 (Polyethylenes)', '0 (Solutions)', '25718-55-2 (polyethylene carbonate)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

After treatment with phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate (PMA) or 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D(3) [1,25(OH)(2)D(3)], HL-60 cells differentiate into cells with the phenotype of monocytes/macrophages. We previously showed that peripheral blood monocytes and the murine J774 monocytic cell line express the CaR, and myeloid progenitors in the bone marrow and myeloid cells in peripheral blood other than monocytes express lower levels of the CaR. Therefore, we investigated whether undifferentiated HL-60 cells express a functional G protein-coupled, extracellular calcium (Ca(2+)(o))-sensing receptor (CaR) and if the expression of the CaR increases as these cells differentiate along the monocytic lineage. The use of reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) with CaR-specific primers, followed by sequencing of the amplified products, identified an authentic CaR transcript in undifferentiated HL-60 cells. Both immunocytochemistry and Western blot analysis using a CaR-specific antiserum detected low levels of CaR protein expression in undifferentiated HL-60 cells. The levels of CaR protein increased considerably following treatment of the cells with PMA (50 nM) or 1,25(OH)(2)D(3) (100 nM) for 5 days. Northern analysis using a CaR-specific riboprobe identified CaR transcripts in undifferentiated HL-60 cells, but CaR mRNA levels did not change appreciably after treatment with either agent, suggesting that upregulation of CaR protein occurs at a translational level. PMA-treated HL-60 cells expressed a nonselective cation channel (NCC), and the calcimimetic CaR activator, NPS R-467, but not its less active stereoisomer, NPS S-467, as well as the polycationic CaR agonist, neomycin, activated this NCC, demonstrating that the CaR expressed in these cells is functionally active. Therefore, HL-60 cells exhibit an increase in CaR protein expression, occurring at a translational level during their differentiation into cells with a monocyte/macrophage phenotype in response to treatment with PMA or 1, 25(OH)(2)D(3), which is functionally linked to activation of a nonselective cation channel.","['Yamaguchi, T', 'Ye, C', 'Chattopadhyay, N', 'Sanders, J L', 'Vassilev, P M', 'Brown, E M']","['Yamaguchi T', 'Ye C', 'Chattopadhyay N', 'Sanders JL', 'Vassilev PM', 'Brown EM']","[""Endocrine-Hypertension Division, Department of Medicine, Brigham and Women's Hospital, 221 Longwood Ave., and Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts 02115, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Calcif Tissue Int,Calcified tissue international,7905481,IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Calcium/*metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'DNA Primers/genetics', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Ion Channels/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Monocytes/cytology/drug effects/*metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'Receptors, Calcium-Sensing', 'Receptors, Cell Surface/genetics/*metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology']",2000/04/25 09:00,2000/06/24 11:00,['2000/04/25 09:00'],"['2000/04/25 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/06/24 11:00 [medline]', '2000/04/25 09:00 [entrez]']","['CT253-98 [pii]', '10.1007/s002230010076 [doi]']",ppublish,Calcif Tissue Int. 2000 May;66(5):375-82. doi: 10.1007/s002230010076.,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (Ion Channels)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Calcium-Sensing)', '0 (Receptors, Cell Surface)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",,,,"['DK41415/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'DK48330/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'DK52005/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,['NASA'],"['NASA Discipline Musculoskeletal', 'Non-NASA Center']","[""O'Malley BW""]","[""O'Malley, B W""]","['Baylor Coll Med, Houston, TX']",,,

The present study examined the effect of ALDH-1 antisense RNA expression on ALDH-1 activity and sensitivity to 4-HC toxicity. Three different ALDH-1 cDNAs were synthesized that are either missing the N terminus (N), C terminus (C), or both (NC) and subcloned into the BamHI cloning site of pLXSN retroviral vector in the antisense (AS) orientation (AS-N, AS-C, and AS-NC, respectively). It was demonstrated that the overexpression of each of the AS constructs in K562 leukemic cells and A549 lung cancer cells results in suppression of ALDH-1 mRNA and enzymatic activity. Furthermore, the AS-N and AS-NC were generally more effective than AS-C in reducing the ALDH-1 activity. Both K562 and A549 cells expressing the ALDH-1 AS became significantly more sensitive to 4-HC toxicity as demonstrated by clonogenic and liquid culture assays. The increase in 4-HC sensitivity was in correlation with the degree of suppression of ALDH-1 activity. Moreover, such increase in 4-HC sensitivity, especially with AS-N and AS-NC, was to a similar degree seen with the use of diethylaminobenzaldehyde, a specific inhibitor of ALDH-1. These results indicate that ALDH-1 expression and activity can be specifically and effectively suppressed by AS RNA and lead to increased sensitivity to 4-HC.","['Moreb, J S', 'Maccow, C', 'Schweder, M', 'Hecomovich, J']","['Moreb JS', 'Maccow C', 'Schweder M', 'Hecomovich J']","['Division of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Medicine, University of Florida, Gainesville, Florida32610-0277, USA. morebjs@medicine.ufl.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Pharmacol Exp Ther,The Journal of pharmacology and experimental therapeutics,0376362,IM,"['Aldehyde Dehydrogenase/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Blotting, Northern', 'Blotting, Southern', 'Blotting, Western', 'Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung/metabolism', 'Cyclophosphamide/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'DNA, Neoplasm/biosynthesis', 'Genetic Vectors', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Experimental/metabolism', 'Lung Neoplasms/metabolism', 'RNA, Antisense/*biosynthesis', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis', 'Transfection/genetics', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2000/04/25 09:00,2000/06/24 11:00,['2000/04/25 09:00'],"['2000/04/25 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/06/24 11:00 [medline]', '2000/04/25 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Pharmacol Exp Ther. 2000 May;293(2):390-6.,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (RNA, Antisense)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'EC 1.2.1.3 (Aldehyde Dehydrogenase)', 'U880A4FUDA (perfosfamide)']",,,,['R29-CA59684/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Quantitative binding in both matrices increased with higher microsomal protein concentrations (free fractions 0.88-0.32 at 100-500 microg protein/ml in human liver microsomes and 0.82-0.26 at 250-1000 microg protein/ml in microsomes from B-lymphoblastoid cells) and was independent of amitriptyline concentration over a concentration range of 0.2 to 200 microM. Addition of heat-inactivated microsomal protein (50-450 microg/ml) to native human liver microsomes (50 microg/ml) reduced the amitriptyline N-demethylation rate in a protein concentration dependent manner. This effect was greater at lower substrate concentrations and was overcome by saturating concentrations of substrate, thereby decreasing the apparent affinities of the high- and low-affinity components of the N-demethylation process, with minimal effect on the net V(max). Addition of metabolically inactive microsomes from untransfected human lymphoblastoid cells (750 microg/ml) to CYP2C19 (250 microg/ml protein) increased the apparent K(m) value for amitriptyline N-demethylation by 3.5-fold and increased the uncompetitive substrate inhibition constant (K(s)) by 2.2-fold, making substrate inhibition essentially undetectable. A similar effect was seen with CYP3A4, with a 1.8-fold increase in the S(50) (substrate concentration at which half-maximal velocity of a Hill enzyme is achieved). Microsomal binding did not alter the V(max) of either CYP isoform to any appreciable extent.

Based on these findings, we proposed that, upon ""enforced aggregation,"" both Bcl-2 and Bcl-2/Delta34 can form ""pores"" in membranes, which may contribute to the release of cytochrome c in apoptosis.","['Chen, C', 'Lin, H', 'Chen, B D']","['Chen C', 'Lin H', 'Chen BD']","['Division of Hematology-Oncology, Barbara Ann Karmanos Cancer Institute, Detroit, Michigan 48201, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Biochem Biophys Res Commun,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,0372516,IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis', 'Caspase 3', 'Caspases/*metabolism', 'Cytosol/metabolism', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Erythrocytes/*physiology', 'Hemoglobins/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia', 'Mitochondria/*metabolism', 'Protein Biosynthesis', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/genetics/immunology/*metabolism', 'Sheep', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2000/04/25 09:00,2000/06/08 09:00,['2000/04/25 09:00'],"['2000/04/25 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/06/08 09:00 [medline]', '2000/04/25 09:00 [entrez]']","['10.1006/bbrc.2000.2520 [doi]', 'S0006291X00925208 [pii]']",ppublish,Biochem Biophys Res Commun. 2000 Apr 21;270(3):816-20. doi: 10.1006/bbrc.2000.2520.,"['0 (Antibodies)', '0 (Hemoglobins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",,,['Copyright 2000 Academic Press.'],['CA 73212/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Following immunofluorescence, the MCR appeared to be primarily nuclear whereas the ENaC was almost exclusively membrane-bound. Paradoxically, the MCR-specific antagonist ZK 91587 actually stimulated the multiplication of human erythroblastic leukemia cells, contrary to the inhibitory effect of the antagonist RU 26752 on the multiplication of corneal fibroblasts; both effects were opposed by aldosterone. In quantitative PCR, both basal and aldosterone-induced levels of ENaC were diminished by ZK 91587 in the corneal fibroblast, in contrast to the stimulation observed in the retinal pigmentary epithelium.

We analyzed the expression of VEGF mRNA levels in human breast-tumor derived GI-101A cells and in human promyelocytic leukemia derived HL-60 cells using RT-PCR technique. During our RT-PCR analysis we detected the expression of three splice variants of VEGF mRNA at 400, 520 and, 650 bp lengths, which were amplified by a single set of VEGF specific forward and reverse primers. The three RT-PCR products detected by us in these cells correspond to the mRNA splice variants coding for the three isoforms of VEGF respectively, VEGF(121), VEGF(165), and VEGF(189). Treatment of GI-101A and HL-60 cells with phorbol 12, 13-dibutyrate (PDB) or diethylstilbestrol (DES) resulted in a significant increase of VEGF mRNA levels in a dose dependent manner. Both treatments increased the levels of all three splice variants of VEGF mRNA and a maximum increase was detected with 10 microM concentrations of PDB or DES treatments after 2 h. Interestingly, both PDB and DES mediated stimulation of VEGF mRNA expression was completely blocked by the PKC inhibitor chelerythrine. Quantitation of VEGF levels by ELISA technique confirmed that changes seen in mRNA levels following different treatments altered the release of VEGF. Our results suggest that PDB and DES mediated effects on VEGF expression in GI-101A and HL-60 cells occur at the gene transcription level.","['Ramakrishnan, R', 'Zell, J A', 'Malave, A', 'Rathinavelu, A']","['Ramakrishnan R', 'Zell JA', 'Malave A', 'Rathinavelu A']","['Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, College of Pharmacy, Ft.

The Epo-induced kinetics and dose response on phosphorylated Jak2 in anti-SHP-1 precipitates of UT-7/Epo cell lysates were similar to those in direct anti-Jak2 precipitates, suggesting that Jak2 coprecipitated with SHP-1. Furthermore, immunoblotting with anti-Jak2 and anti-SHP-1 antibodies indicated that SHP-1 appeared to be constitutively associated with non-tyrosine-phosphorylated Jak2 in UT-7/Epo cells in the absence of Epo and without phosphorylation of the Epo receptor (EpoR). Competition studies with C-terminal SHP-1 and Jak2 peptides decreased the amounts of SHP-1 and Jak2 detected in immunoprecipitates supporting the specific coprecipitation of SHP-1 and Jak2. In the presence of a recombinant GST-fusion protein containing both the N-terminal and C-terminal SH2 domains of SHP-1, anti-GST precipitated the fusion protein but not cellular Jak2. These studies suggest that SHP-1 and Jak2 are constitutively associated in UT-7/EPO cells. The association is not dependent upon Epo and is not mediated via SHP-1 SH2 binding. Sequential double immunoprecipitation demonstrated that only a small portion of intracellular Jak2 and SHP-1 molecules are constitutively associated. This partial association pattern may allow a more flexible and diverse regulation of Jak2 and SHP-1 activities. Whether Jak2 and SHP-1 are directly associated with each other or are part of a larger complex needs further investigation.","['Wu, D W', 'Stark, K C', 'Dunnington, D', 'Dillon, S B', 'Yi, T', 'Jones, C', 'Pelus, L M']","['Wu DW', 'Stark KC', 'Dunnington D', 'Dillon SB', 'Yi T', 'Jones C', 'Pelus LM']","['Department of Molecular Virology and Host Defense, SmithKline Beecham Pharmaceuticals, Collegeville, Pennsylvania, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Blood Cells Mol Dis,"Blood cells, molecules & diseases",9509932,IM,"['Antibodies', 'Binding, Competitive', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Erythropoietin/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Immunoblotting', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins', 'Janus Kinase 2', 'Kinetics', 'Peptides', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Precipitin Tests', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Phosphatase 1', 'Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 11', 'Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 6', 'Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases/immunology/*metabolism', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/immunology/*metabolism', '*Proto-Oncogene Proteins', 'Receptors, Erythropoietin', 'SH2 Domain-Containing Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases', 'Signal Transduction', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'src Homology Domains']",2000/04/25 09:00,2000/07/15 11:00,['2000/04/25 09:00'],"['2000/04/25 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/07/15 11:00 [medline]', '2000/04/25 09:00 [entrez]']","['10.1006/bcmd.2000.0273 [doi]', 'S1079-9796(00)90273-0 [pii]']",ppublish,Blood Cells Mol Dis. 2000 Feb;26(1):15-24. doi: 10.1006/bcmd.2000.0273.,"['0 (Antibodies)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Peptides)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Erythropoietin)', '11096-26-7 (Erythropoietin)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (JAK2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 2)', 'EC 3.1.3.16 (Protein Phosphatase 1)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (PTPN11 protein, human)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (PTPN6 protein, human)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 11)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 6)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (SH2 Domain-Containing Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases)']",,,['Copyright 2000 Academic Press.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Retinoids, potent immune modulators, were shown to inhibit the activation-induced apoptosis of immature thymocytes and T-cell hybridomas. To illustrate the mechanism of the inhibition, we examined the effects of retinoic acid (RA) on the expression and transactivation functions of Nur77 in the human peripheral blood mononuclear cells and the human T-cell leukemia, Jurkat. All-trans-RA remarkably repressed the DNA binding and transcriptional induction of Nur77. Among the two potential trans-acting factors that activate Nur77 gene promoter, i.e., AP-1 and related serum response factor (RSRF), all-trans-RA repressed DNA binding and reporter gene activity of AP-1 but not that of RSRF, suggesting that the inhibition may be mediated through AP-1. We also demonstrated a posttranscriptional regulation of Nur77 function by retinoid receptors by showing that transactivation activity of Nur77 was significantly inhibited by cotransfection of RARalpha or RXRalpha. Nur77 bound RARalpha or RXRalpha in both yeast and mammalian two-hybrid tests, suggesting that direct protein-protein interaction between these receptors may mediate the inhibition. Taken all together, we demonstrated that RA repressed Nur77 function through multiple mechanisms that may provide the basis for RA inhibition on the apoptosis of activated T-lymphocytes.","['Kang, H J', 'Song, M R', 'Lee, S K', 'Shin, E C', 'Choi, Y H', 'Kim, S J', 'Lee, J W', 'Lee, M O']","['Kang HJ', 'Song MR', 'Lee SK', 'Shin EC', 'Choi YH', 'Kim SJ', 'Lee JW', 'Lee MO']","['Department of Microbiology, Yonsei University College of Medicine, Seoul, 120-752, Korea.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Exp Cell Res,Experimental cell research,0373226,IM,"['Amino Acid Motifs', 'Apoptosis/*physiology', 'DNA/metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Nuclear Receptor Subfamily 4, Group A, Member 1', 'Protein Binding', 'Receptors, Cytoplasmic and Nuclear/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Retinoic Acid/metabolism/*physiology', 'Receptors, Steroid', 'T-Lymphocytes/*cytology', 'Transcription Factors/*metabolism', 'Transfection', 'Tretinoin/metabolism/pharmacology/*physiology', 'Two-Hybrid System Techniques']",2000/04/25 09:00,2000/05/20 09:00,['2000/04/25 09:00'],"['2000/04/25 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/05/20 09:00 [medline]', '2000/04/25 09:00 [entrez]']","['10.1006/excr.2000.4832 [doi]', 'S0014-4827(00)94832-8 [pii]']",ppublish,Exp Cell Res. 2000 May 1;256(2):545-54. doi: 10.1006/excr.2000.4832.,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (NR4A1 protein, human)', '0 (Nuclear Receptor Subfamily 4, Group A, Member 1)', '0 (Receptors, Cytoplasmic and Nuclear)', '0 (Receptors, Retinoic Acid)', '0 (Receptors, Steroid)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",,,['Copyright 2000 Academic Press.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this review, progress toward that goal is evaluated by using as examples well-studied environmental exposures-i.e., tobacco smoke, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, aflatoxin B(1), benzene, and hepatitis B virus-and their roles in lung, breast, and liver cancers and leukemia. The contributions of molecular epidemiology discussed here include providing evidence that environmental agents pose carcinogenic risks, helping establish the causal roles of environmental factors in cancer, identifying environment-susceptibility interactions and populations at greatest risk, and developing new intervention strategies. Molecular epidemiologic and other data indicate that assessment of carcinogenic risks should address both the range of risk across the population and the risk to subgroups who may be at high risk because of genetic or acquired susceptibilities, including young children. However, for the most part, research results have not yet been effectively translated into risk assessments and preventive health policies. An infrastructure linking scientists, policy makers, and other constituencies is needed to facilitate this process. To extend our knowledge, the second generation of molecular epidemiologic research should include large-scale, collaborative studies incorporating validated biomarkers and automated technologies.

In order to confirm and expand these studies, we have compared several H1-blockers and the H2-blocker ranitidine for their effect on TNF-alpha, IL-3, 6, 8 and GM-CSF release from human leukemic mast (HMC-1) and basophilic (KU812) cells, compared to dexamethasone. Cells were stimulated for 24 h with phorbol myristate acetate (25 ng/ml) and calcium ionophore A 23187 (2.5x10(-7) M) alone or with the drugs added at 10(-4) to 10(-15) M, and production of cytokines was measured by ELISA. All antihistamines caused a dose-dependent inhibition of TNF-alpha release from HMC-1 cells, with maximal effects at 10(-12) M for azelastine, 10(-9) M for loratadine and cetirizine, and 10(-8) M for ranitidine. The inhibitory potency of H1-blockers on cytokines from HMC-1 cells was TNF-alpha >IL-8> or =IL-6> or =IL-3, with no significant effects on GM-CSF. In KU812 cells which failed to secrete TNF-alpha and GM-CSF, the sequence was IL-6 >IL-8 after preincubation. Dexamethasone inhibited all cytokines, but ranitidine only TNF-alpha and IL-3. Antihistamines had no effect on calcium flux in resting or stimulated cells. At the mRNA level, inhibition was only seen with KU812 cells and IL-8 in the presence of azelastine at 10-(10) M. These data show thus distinct inhibitory patterns for different antihistamines during cytokine production from human mast cells and basophils which may contribute to the anti-inflammatory effects of these drugs during treatment of allergic diseases.","['Lippert, U', 'Moller, A', 'Welker, P', 'Artuc, M', 'Henz, B M']","['Lippert U', 'Moller A', 'Welker P', 'Artuc M', 'Henz BM']","['Department of Dermatology, Charite, Humboldt University, Berlin, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Denmark,Exp Dermatol,Experimental dermatology,9301549,IM,"['Basophils/*metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Cytokines/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Dexamethasone/pharmacology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Glucocorticoids/pharmacology', 'Histamine H1 Antagonists/*pharmacology', 'Histamine H2 Antagonists/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*metabolism', 'Mast Cells/*metabolism']",2000/04/20 09:00,2000/06/10 09:00,['2000/04/20 09:00'],"['2000/04/20 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/06/10 09:00 [medline]', '2000/04/20 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1034/j.1600-0625.2000.009002118.x [doi]'],ppublish,Exp Dermatol. 2000 Apr;9(2):118-24. doi: 10.1034/j.1600-0625.2000.009002118.x.,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Glucocorticoids)', '0 (Histamine H1 Antagonists)', '0 (Histamine H2 Antagonists)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)']",,,,,,,['Exp Dermatol. 2002 Aug;11(4):386.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Using several New York HGE isolates, we show that the HGE agent-elicited apoptosis is accompanied by increased processing of nuclear enzyme poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP), concurrent with a noticeable increase in caspase 3 activities. A marked increase in the amounts of the signaling molecule ceramide but not of diacylglycerol was also observed in HGE agent-infected HL-60 cells, compared with the amounts in uninfected controls. Simultaneous or prior treatment of infected HL-60 cells with the ceramide synthase inhibitor fumonisin B1 did not affect the magnitude of infection by the intracellular pathogen, as determined by both the presence of morulae and the expression of its outer surface membrane protein, p44. These results suggest that the observed changes in ceramide are generated through the sphingomyelinase pathway and not by way of de novo synthesis of ceramide. We also assayed for changes in intracellular hydrogen peroxide and show that the HGE agent causes a decrease in its concentrations in infected cells.","['DiPietrantonio, A M', 'Hsieh, T C', 'Wu, J M']","['DiPietrantonio AM', 'Hsieh TC', 'Wu JM']","['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, New York Medical College, Valhalla 10595, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,IUBMB Life,IUBMB life,100888706,IM,"['*Apoptosis', 'Blotting, Western', 'Carboxylic Acids/pharmacology', 'Caspase 3', 'Caspases/*metabolism', 'Ceramides/*metabolism', 'Diglycerides/metabolism', 'Ehrlichiosis/*metabolism/*microbiology', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', '*Fumonisins', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Hydrogen Peroxide/*metabolism', 'Poly (ADP-Ribose) Polymerase-1', 'Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases/*metabolism', 'Proteins/metabolism', 'Reactive Oxygen Species', 'Signal Transduction', 'Time Factors']",2000/04/20 09:00,2000/07/06 11:00,['2000/04/20 09:00'],"['2000/04/20 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/07/06 11:00 [medline]', '2000/04/20 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/713803590 [doi]'],ppublish,IUBMB Life. 2000 Jan;49(1):49-55. doi: 10.1080/713803590.,"['0 (Carboxylic Acids)', '0 (Ceramides)', '0 (Diglycerides)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Fumonisins)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '3ZZM97XZ32 (fumonisin B1)', 'BBX060AN9V (Hydrogen Peroxide)', 'EC 2.4.2.30 (PARP1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.4.2.30 (Poly (ADP-Ribose) Polymerase-1)', 'EC 2.4.2.30 (Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Patients received 30 g of oral glutamine or placebo daily. RESULTS: The trends of decreased median length of stay and the median number of days of total parenteral nutrition (TPN) were seen in the group supplemented with the >0.285-g/kg (the recommended dosage) dose of glutamine; however, there was no statistically significant difference in the nutritional status and overall patient outcome as assessed by days receiving TPN, number of days required until oral intake resumed, length of hospitalization, number of days and highest grade of mucositis, and quantity and number of days of diarrhea.

The exact mechanism by which patients with DS are predisposed to develop malignancies is unclear.

We have investigated the growth-inhibitory properties of this compound alone and in combination with ionizing radiation in a panel of established human melanoma cell lines as well as in normal human melanocytes. Betulinic acid strongly and consistently suppressed the growth and colony-forming ability of all human melanoma cell lines investigated. In combination with ionizing radiation the effect of betulinic acid on growth inhibition was additive in colony-forming assays. Betulinic acid also induced apoptosis in human melanoma cells as demonstrated by Annexin V binding and by the emergence of cells with apoptotic morphology. The growth-inhibitory action of betulinic acid was more pronounced in human melanoma cell lines than in normal human melanocytes. Notably, despite the induction of apoptosis, analysis of the expression of Bcl-2 family members in betulinic-acid-treated cells revealed that expression of the anti-apoptotic protein Mcl-1 was induced. Furthermore, the antiproliferative action of betulinic acid seemed to be independent of the p53 status. The properties of betulinic acid make it an interesting candidate, not only as a single agent but also in combination with radiotherapy. We conclude that the strictly additive mode of growth inhibition in combination with irradiation suggests that the two treatment modalities may function by inducing different cell death pathways or by affecting different target cell populations.","['Selzer, E', 'Pimentel, E', 'Wacheck, V', 'Schlegel, W', 'Pehamberger, H', 'Jansen, B', 'Kodym, R']","['Selzer E', 'Pimentel E', 'Wacheck V', 'Schlegel W', 'Pehamberger H', 'Jansen B', 'Kodym R']","['Department of Radiotherapy and Radiobiology, University Hospital, Vienna, Austria.

The gene expression of FEN-1 was higher in mitotic cells than in resting cells, and was markedly decreased, especially, when terminal differentiation was induced in promyelocytic leukemia cells (HL-60 cells). The decline correlated substantially with the ceasing of DNA synthesis. In the examination of tissue-specific gene expression, the human testis, spleen, thymus and mucosal lining of colon tissues expressed this gene actively, whereas the prostate, ovary, small intestine and peripheral blood leukocyte hardly expressed it. In addition, FEN-1 was co-localized with the proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) in young rat kidney according to immunohistochemistry.

A lymphoblastic T-cell line, ST4, obtained from a patient in long-lasting complete remission, was retrovirally engineered with the IL-2, IL-7, and IL-7 plus IL-2 genes; in addition, clones releasing different amounts of the cytokines were obtained by limiting dilution. Mixed lymphocyte-tumor cultures (MLTCs) were set up with parental or transduced leukemic cells as stimulators and with autologous or allogeneic lymphocytes as responders. When nonirradiated ST4 parental cells or clones producing <50 international units (IU)/mL/10(6) cells/72 hours of IL-2 were used as stimulators, leukemic overgrowth was observed in MLTCs within 16 days of culture. When clones producing >80 IU/mL/10(6) cells/72 hours of IL-2 were used as stimulators, the proliferation of leukemic cells was blocked and the transduced leukemic cells were completely cleared from the cultures by day 16; repeated restimulations with IL-2-producing leukemic cells were required to sustain long-term lymphocyte survival. On the contrary, when IL-7- or IL-7-IL-2-producing cells were used as stimulators, only a delay in leukemic cell overgrowth was observed, and lymphocytes were completely cleared from the cultures after day 60. IL-7 production by the different clones ranged between 11 and 36 ng/mL/10(6) cells/72 hours, whereas the highest IL-2-producing IL-7-IL-2 clone released 50 IU/mL/10(6) cells/72 hours of IL-2. When the stimulator efficacy of the highest IL-2-producing clone (ST4/IL-2#A7) was compared with that of exogenous IL-2 plus parental cells, a 7-fold higher amount of exogenous IL-2 was required to achieve the same results obtained with IL-2-producing leukemic cells. Autologous and allogeneic long-term MLTCs (up to 35 days) with ST4/IL-2#A7 as the stimulator were capable of generating cytotoxic effectors equally endowed with both major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I-unrestricted and -restricted activity against parental ST4 cells. By day 18 of both autologous and allogeneic cultures, a substantial proportion of CD56+ cells was consistently recorded; this was coupled to a predominantly MHC-unrestricted cytotoxic activity directed against parental ST4 cells. CD56+ cells decreased considerably at the end of the different MLTCs, together with the unrestricted cytotoxic activity. At this time, >50% of the cells were CD8+, and 55% of the activity could be blocked by an anti-MHC class I monoclonal antibody. The results of this study demonstrate that IL-2 gene-transduced human acute leukemia cells cocultured with both autologous and allogeneic lymphocytes are capable of inducing a strong MHC-unrestricted anti-leukemic activity and subsequently ""educating"" MHC class I-restricted anti-leukemic effectors. The evidence that the immunogenic potential of human leukemic blasts can be boosted after transfer of the IL-2 gene suggests that the possibility of using leukemic cells engineered to release IL-2 as a therapeutic vaccine needs to be explored further.","['Cignetti, A', 'Guarini, A', 'Gillio Tos, A', 'Reato, G', 'Foa, R']","['Cignetti A', 'Guarini A', 'Gillio Tos A', 'Reato G', 'Foa R']","['Dipartimento di Scienze Biomediche ed Oncologia Umana, University of Torino, Italy. acignetti@ircc.unito.it']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Cancer Gene Ther,Cancer gene therapy,9432230,IM,"['Cancer Vaccines/immunology/pharmacology', 'Cell Division/genetics/immunology', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/genetics/immunology', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic/genetics', 'Gene Transfer Techniques', 'Genetic Therapy', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-2/*genetics/therapeutic use', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/*genetics/immunology/pathology/*therapy', 'Lymphocyte Culture Test, Mixed', 'Major Histocompatibility Complex/*genetics/*immunology', 'Transforming Growth Factor beta/biosynthesis', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Vaccines, DNA/immunology/pharmacology']",2000/04/19 09:00,2000/08/12 11:00,['2000/04/19 09:00'],"['2000/04/19 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/08/12 11:00 [medline]', '2000/04/19 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.cgt.7700107 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Gene Ther. 2000 Feb;7(2):167-76. doi: 10.1038/sj.cgt.7700107.,"['0 (Cancer Vaccines)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Transforming Growth Factor beta)', '0 (Vaccines, DNA)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We prospectively compared bone marrow and PBSC for allogeneic transplantation. METHODS: Adult HLA-identical sibling donors provided bone marrow and lenograstim-mobilised PBSC. 39 patients with malignant haematological disorders were infused with either bone marrow (n=19) or PBSC (n=20) after standard conditioning regimens in a double-blind, randomised fashion. The identity of the infused products for all patients remained masked until 1 year after the last patient had received transplantation. FINDINGS: The PBSC group had significantly faster neutrophil recovery to 0.5x10(9)/L (median 17.5 vs 23 days, p=0.002), and platelet recovery to 20x10(9)/L (median 11 vs 18 days, p<0.0001) and to 50x10(9)/L (median 20.5 vs 27 days, p=0.02) than the bone-marrow group. PBSC patients were discharged from hospital earlier than were bone-marrow patients (median 26 vs 31 days, p=0.01). At 4 weeks after transplantation, absolute lymphocytes (0.48 vs 0.63, p=0.08) and CD25 cells (0.04 vs 0.08, p=0.007) were higher in the PBSC group, and the proportion of patients with absolute lymphopenia (74% vs 33%, p=0.03) and CD4 lymphopenia (59% vs 24%, p=0.05) was significantly higher in the bone-marrow group. There was no significant difference in the occurrence of acute or chronic graft-versus-host disease and overall survival. The probability of relapse was significantly higher in the bone-marrow group than in the PBSC group (p=0.01); all five relapses occurred among bone-marrow recipients. INTERPRETATION: Our small study indicates that PBSCs are better than bone marrow for allogeneic transplantation from HLA-identical siblings in terms of faster haematopoietic and immune recovery, and have the potential to reduce disease recurrence.","['Powles, R', 'Mehta, J', 'Kulkarni, S', 'Treleaven, J', 'Millar, B', 'Marsden, J', 'Shepherd, V', 'Rowland, A', 'Sirohi, B', 'Tait, D', 'Horton, C', 'Long, S', 'Singhal, S']","['Powles R', 'Mehta J', 'Kulkarni S', 'Treleaven J', 'Millar B', 'Marsden J', 'Shepherd V', 'Rowland A', 'Sirohi B', 'Tait D', 'Horton C', 'Long S', 'Singhal S']","['Leukaemia Unit, Royal Marsden Hospital, and Institute of Cancer Research, Sutton, Surrey, UK. leukaemia@clara.net']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Lancet,"Lancet (London, England)",2985213R,IM,"['Adult', 'Blood Platelets/metabolism', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Double-Blind Method', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease/*prevention & control', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*prevention & control/*therapy', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neutrophils/metabolism', 'Prospective Studies', 'Recurrence', '*Stem Cell Transplantation']",2000/04/19 00:00,2000/04/19 00:01,['2000/04/19 00:00'],"['2000/04/19 00:00 [pubmed]', '2000/04/19 00:01 [medline]', '2000/04/19 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0140-6736(00)02090-0 [pii]', '10.1016/S0140-6736(00)02090-0 [doi]']",ppublish,Lancet. 2000 Apr 8;355(9211):1231-7. doi: 10.1016/S0140-6736(00)02090-0.,,,,,,['Lancet. 2000 Apr 8;355(9211):1199-200.

It is recognized that differentiation results from an interaction of environmental cues, such as cytokines and hormones, with internal cellular programs, but the precise mechanisms are not entirely clear. HL60 cells, a human acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cell line with promyelocytic features, provide a model for such studies because they behave like stem cells, which can differentiate into two different lineages, granulocytic or monocytic/macrophage, depending on the inducer. Protein levels and kinase activity of cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (Cdk5) were reported [F. Chen and G. P. Studzinski (1999) Exp. Cell Res. 249, 422, 1999] to increase in HL60 cells induced to monocytic differentiation by 1alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25D3), but the specificity of the association of Cdk5 with the monocytic phenotype has not been established. We show here that up-regulation of Cdk5 does not occur in granulocytic differentiation, whereas inhibition of Cdk5 activity by olomoucine, or its expression by a plasmid construct expressing antisense Cdk5, switches the 1,25D3-induced monocytic phenotype (a combination of positive nonspecific esterase reaction, expression of the CD14 marker, and morphology) to general myeloid phenotype (positive nitro-blue tetrazolium reaction, CD11b marker and morphology). The transcriptional up-regulation of Cdk5 by 1,25D3 was not inhibited by olomoucine. These findings show that in human myeloid cells up-regulation of Cdk5 is specifically associated with the monocytic phenotype.","['Chen, F', 'Rao, J', 'Studzinski, G P']","['Chen F', 'Rao J', 'Studzinski GP']","['Department of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine, UMD-New Jersey Medical School, Newark 07103-2714, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Leukoc Biol,Journal of leukocyte biology,8405628,IM,"['Biomarkers', 'Calcitriol/pharmacology', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', '*Cell Lineage', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 5', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinases/*biosynthesis', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Monocytes/enzymology/*pathology', 'Up-Regulation/drug effects']",2000/04/19 00:00,2000/04/19 00:01,['2000/04/19 00:00'],"['2000/04/19 00:00 [pubmed]', '2000/04/19 00:01 [medline]', '2000/04/19 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/jlb.67.4.559 [doi]'],ppublish,J Leukoc Biol. 2000 Apr;67(4):559-66. doi: 10.1002/jlb.67.4.559.,"['0 (Biomarkers)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 5)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (CDK5 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinases)', 'FXC9231JVH (Calcitriol)']",,,,['2 RO1-CA44722/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To better understand the phenomenon of cross-resistance, we developed seven CEM/ara-C-resistant leukemic clones from the CEM/0 (wt) cell line. These clones ranged from 4- to 3.5 x 10(8)-fold more resistant to ara-C than the wt CEM/0 cell line. Using this model, we determined IC50 concentrations to several chemotherapeutic agents and gamma radiation, and we also studied pro- (p53) and anti-apoptotic (bcl-2) proteins, as well as P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and multidrug resistance related protein (MRP). The cell viability assays showed that these clones were cross-resistant to 6-thioguanine (6-TG) or 6-mercaptoguanosine (6-TGuo) from 1.1- to 8.8-fold with ara-C; cross-resistance to vincristine (VCR) was from 200- to 1 x 10(4)-fold with ara-C. Taxotere (TXR) showed cross-resistance with ara-C from 1.39- to 3.03 x 10(3)-fold; dexamethasone (DEX) also showed a significant degree of cross-resistance from 27.4- to 3.87 x 10(7)-fold. Gamma radiation treatments from 0.77 Gy to 12.3 Gy showed a radiation dose-dependent cross-resistance with ara-C from 1.43- to 2.93-fold. Idarubicin was collaterally sensitive with ara-C from 4.6- to 1 x 10(9)-fold in these cell lines. The CEM/ara-C/G resistant cell line was 3-fold more sensitive to 6-TG or VCR than CEM/0 (wt), and 5-fold more sensitive to 6-TGuo. This cell clone expressed p53 and did not overexpress bcl-2 protein. All of the cell lines studied, CEM/0 (wt) and the ara-C resistant clones, showed functional p53 protein. The cell treatment with 0.1, 1 and 10 microM ara-C for 48 hours showed increased p53 protein expression in most of these lines. No increase in bcl-2 protein expression was seen in the wt cell line after ara-C treatment for 48 hours. Three cell lines resistant to ara-C (CEM/ara-C/B, CEM/ara-C/D and CEM/ara-C/I) showed an important increased expression of bcl-2 protein after treatment with 1 microM ara-C, but not after 10 microM. This alteration may lead to resistance to apoptosis and enhanced cell survival. The ratio of bcl-2 to p53 was increased significantly in these three clones, thus favoring an anti-apoptotic drive. All of the cell lines examined were negative for MRP expression and only two, CEM/ara-C/B and CEM/ara-C/J, were positive for MRP functional activity. However, three ara-C resistant cell clones, CEM/ara-C/7A, CEM/ara-C/B and CEM/ara-C/G, were positive for P-gp expression and functional activity. It is apparent that selection for ara-C resistance confers cross-resistance to many other classes of drugs and gamma radiation, probably due to bcl-2 protein overexpression or P-gp and MRP expression, as independent mechanisms.","['Martin-Aragon, S', 'Mukherjee, S K', 'Taylor, B J', 'Ivy, S P', 'Fu, C H', 'Ardi, V C', 'Avramis, V I']","['Martin-Aragon S', 'Mukherjee SK', 'Taylor BJ', 'Ivy SP', 'Fu CH', 'Ardi VC', 'Avramis VI']","['Department of Pediatrics, USC School of Medicine, Childrens Hospital Los Angeles 90027, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Greece,Anticancer Res,Anticancer research,8102988,IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/analysis', 'ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters/analysis', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/*pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/*pharmacology', 'Cytarabine/*pharmacology', 'Dexamethasone/pharmacology', 'Docetaxel', '*Drug Resistance, Multiple', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Gamma Rays', 'Guanosine/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/metabolism/*pathology', 'Multidrug Resistance-Associated Proteins', 'Neoplasm Proteins/analysis', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/chemistry/*drug effects/radiation effects', 'Paclitaxel/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/analysis', '*Taxoids', 'Thioguanine/*pharmacology', 'Thionucleosides/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/chemistry/drug effects/radiation effects', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/analysis', 'Vincristine/*pharmacology']",2000/04/19 09:00,2000/05/16 09:00,['2000/04/19 09:00'],"['2000/04/19 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/05/16 09:00 [medline]', '2000/04/19 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Anticancer Res. 2000 Jan-Feb;20(1A):139-50.,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters)', '0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Multidrug Resistance-Associated Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Taxoids)', '0 (Thionucleosides)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '12133JR80S (Guanosine)', '15H5577CQD (Docetaxel)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)', 'C558LI0K8P (6-thioguanosine)', 'FTK8U1GZNX (Thioguanine)', 'P88XT4IS4D (Paclitaxel)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The inhibitory activity of the conjugates was evaluated on bovine liver DHFR. The in vitro growth inhibitory effect against MTX-sensitive human lymphoblastoid CCRF-CEM cells and an MTX-resistant sub-line (CEM/MTX), which displays defective intracellular transport of MTX, was determined under short-term and continuous (120-h incubation) exposure conditions. The alpha, gamma, or alpha,gamma amide conjugates showed different activity in inhibiting the growth of parent cells. CEM/MTX cells were much less susceptible than CCRF-CEM cells to inhibition by alpha or alpha,gamma-substituted lipoamino acid conjugates, whereas both cell lines were almost equally sensitive to the MTX-gamma conjugates. Although less potent than MTX, they could partially circumvent the impaired transport system. These findings confirm that lipophilic MTX conjugates may be good lead compounds on the drug development for the treatment of some MTX-resistant tumors. Ester-type conjugates displayed an interesting activity against parent CCRF-CEM cells, although they were less potent against the transport-resistant sub-line. Stability studies on these molecules indicated that they are not degraded into MTX in the culture medium, thus suggesting that they are not able to over-cross cell resistance despite of their lipophilicity.","['Pignatello, R', 'Spampinato, G', 'Sorrenti, V', 'Di Giacomo, C', 'Vicari, L', 'McGuire, J J', 'Russell, C A', 'Puglisi, G', 'Toth, I']","['Pignatello R', 'Spampinato G', 'Sorrenti V', 'Di Giacomo C', 'Vicari L', 'McGuire JJ', 'Russell CA', 'Puglisi G', 'Toth I']","['Department of Pharmaceutical and Biological Chemistry, The School of Pharmacy, University of London, UK. pignatel@mbox.unict.it']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Eur J Pharm Sci,European journal of pharmaceutical sciences : official journal of the European Federation for Pharmaceutical Sciences,9317982,IM,"['Animals', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/administration & dosage/*chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Cattle', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Chemical Phenomena', 'Chemistry, Physical', 'Excipients', 'Folic Acid Antagonists/administration & dosage/*chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/drug therapy/pathology', 'Lipids/chemistry', 'Liver/drug effects/enzymology', 'Mass Spectrometry', 'Methotrexate/administration & dosage/*chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Spectrophotometry, Infrared', 'Tetrahydrofolate Dehydrogenase/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2000/04/18 09:00,2000/08/01 11:00,['2000/04/18 09:00'],"['2000/04/18 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/08/01 11:00 [medline]', '2000/04/18 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0928-0987(00)00062-2 [pii]', '10.1016/s0928-0987(00)00062-2 [doi]']",ppublish,Eur J Pharm Sci. 2000 May;10(3):237-45. doi: 10.1016/s0928-0987(00)00062-2.,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Excipients)', '0 (Folic Acid Antagonists)', '0 (Lipids)', 'EC 1.5.1.3 (Tetrahydrofolate Dehydrogenase)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A 37-year-old married woman, G3P2, underwent high-dose cyclophosphamide accompanied by high dose (1575 cGy) total body irradiation (TBI) as part of her treatment for acute myeloid leukemia (AML: m1) when she was 35 years of age. After TBI, the patient developed ovarian failure and amenorrhea, which was confirmed by hormonal evaluation. Nevertheless, she did not receive any hormonal replacement therapy and stopped her sexual life for two years. Fortunately, no recurrence of AML was noted. The patient visited our clinic due to difficulty in performing coitus. Physical examination showed a 2-cm short and blinded vaginal pouch. She initially received hormonal replacement therapy followed by surgical correction via vaginoplasty and two months of dilatory replacement and frequent coitus with satisfactory result. To our limited knowledge, vaginal obliteration as a complication of condition regimen has never been reported before. In the present case report, it is unclear whether spontaneous vaginal obliteration resulted from chemotherapy, total body irradiation, or another unknown cause such as a concomitant leukemic infiltration of the vaginal wall, severe bacterial and fungal infection before treatment, or from any combination of the above. However, due to this case presentation, we suggest that such patients must receive hormonal replacement therapy and be encouraged to have a normal sexual life to avoid this possible problem.","['Lee, W L', 'Yuan, C C', 'Chao, H T', 'Chen, P M', 'Lin, H D', 'Wang, P H']","['Lee WL', 'Yuan CC', 'Chao HT', 'Chen PM', 'Lin HD', 'Wang PH']","['Division of Metabolism and Endocrinology, Department of Medicine, Veterans General Hospital, Taipei, 201, Section 2, Shih-Pai Road, and National Yang-Ming University School of Medicine, Taipei, Taiwan.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Ireland,Eur J Obstet Gynecol Reprod Biol,"European journal of obstetrics, gynecology, and reproductive biology",0375672,IM,"['Adult', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*adverse effects', 'Coitus', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Cyclophosphamide/*adverse effects', 'Female', 'Hormone Replacement Therapy', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*drug therapy/pathology/*radiotherapy', 'Leukemic Infiltration', 'Sexual Abstinence', 'Vagina/drug effects/*pathology/radiation effects', 'Whole-Body Irradiation/*adverse effects']",2000/04/18 09:00,2000/07/06 11:00,['2000/04/18 09:00'],"['2000/04/18 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/07/06 11:00 [medline]', '2000/04/18 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0301211599001943 [pii]', '10.1016/s0301-2115(99)00194-3 [doi]']",ppublish,Eur J Obstet Gynecol Reprod Biol. 2000 May;90(1):77-9. doi: 10.1016/s0301-2115(99)00194-3.,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Our objective was to evaluate antibody response and safety of the live varicella vaccine in both healthy and immunocompromised Mexican children. METHODS: One hundred children with no history of varicella/zoster were vaccinated with a live attenuated varicella vaccine. According to their immune status, patients were divided into either a compromised (leukemia, solid tumors, chronic renal failure, and cirrhosis) or a healthy children group. Serum IgG antibodies against VZV were measured by ELISA at baseline and at 3 and 6 months after vaccination. RESULTS: A positive VZV-ELISA at baseline was detected in 36 of 67 (53.7%) immunocompromised children and in 22 of 33 (66%) healthy children. Among VZV-seronegative children, seroconversion at 6 months post-vaccination was observed in 90.3% of compromised children and in 100% of healthy children.

The present study was undertaken to evaluate and compare bone marrow aspiration and unilateral biopsy to detect bone marrow metastases in pediatric patients, using bilateral biopsy as the gold standard. METHODS: During a 6-month period, 63 consecutive newly diagnosed children with confirmed malignant diseases other than leukemia were evaluated for bone marrow metastases or infiltration. Biopsies were obtained from both right and left posterior iliac crests whereas aspiration was performed only at the right crest. Interpretation to the right-side biopsy was considered as the unilateral biopsy result, whereas the bilateral biopsy result was as follows: positively was accepted if one or both of the two-side samples were qualified as positive, while a negative result was considered only if both sides were negative. The bilateral biopsy was considered the gold standard, and sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive value, and false positive and negative rates were computed for the unilateral biopsy and aspiration procedure. RESULTS: We identified bone marrow metastases in 11 (17.5%) patients. The sensitivity was the only significant difference (p <0.05) observed between unilateral biopsy and aspiration. Finally, of the 63 patients, unilateral biopsy was reported as inadequate in one patient (1.6%), while aspiration was inadequate in two (3.2%). CONCLUSION: Unilateral biopsy was better than bone marrow aspiration. However, because bilateral biopsy is the gold standard, we recommend using this and bone marrow aspiration simultaneously to evaluate a pediatric patient with any malignancy potentially infiltrating bone marrow.","['Valdes-Sanchez, M', 'Nava-Ocampo, A A', 'Palacios-Gonzalez, R V', 'Perales-Arroyo, A', 'Medina-Sanson, A', 'Martinez-Avalos, A']","['Valdes-Sanchez M', 'Nava-Ocampo AA', 'Palacios-Gonzalez RV', 'Perales-Arroyo A', 'Medina-Sanson A', 'Martinez-Avalos A']","['Department of Oncology, Hospital de Pediatria, Mexico D.F., Mexico.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Arch Med Res,Archives of medical research,9312706,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Biopsy/*methods', 'Bone Marrow Neoplasms/*diagnosis/pathology/secondary', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Lymphoma/*pathology', 'Neoplasms/*pathology']",2000/04/18 09:00,2000/05/20 09:00,['2000/04/18 09:00'],"['2000/04/18 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/05/20 09:00 [medline]', '2000/04/18 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0188-4409(00)00042-4 [pii]', '10.1016/s0188-4409(00)00042-4 [doi]']",ppublish,Arch Med Res. 2000 Jan-Feb;31(1):58-61. doi: 10.1016/s0188-4409(00)00042-4.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As reported here, the human Mcl-1 gene can also undergo differential splicing, which yields an internally deleted, death-inducing gene product, Mcl-1(s/Delta)(TM). Whereas full-length Mcl-1 derives from three coding exons (instead of the two present in Bcl-2 and other anti-apoptotic members of this family), the Mcl-1(s/Delta)(TM) splice variant results from the joining of the first and third exons with skipping of the central exon. Because of the skipped exon and a shift in the reading frame downstream, the Bcl-2 homology domain (BH3) remains intact, whereas the BH1-, BH2-, and transmembrane-encoding domains do not. Mcl-1(s/Delta)(TM) thus has features similar to BH3 only, pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family members and, accordingly, was found to promote cell death. In addition to a variety of other types of regulation, the Mcl-1 gene appears ideally designed for the generation of either a Bcl-2-like viability promoting or, as reported here, a BH3 only death-inducing gene product.","['Bingle, C D', 'Craig, R W', 'Swales, B M', 'Singleton, V', 'Zhou, P', 'Whyte, M K']","['Bingle CD', 'Craig RW', 'Swales BM', 'Singleton V', 'Zhou P', 'Whyte MK']","['Respiratory Cell and Molecular Biology Laboratory, Division of Molecular and Genetic Medicine, The University of Sheffield Medical School, Sheffield, S10 2RX, United Kingdom. c.d.bingle@sheffield.ac.uk']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Apoptosis/*genetics', 'Cell Death/genetics', 'Cell Line', 'Exons/genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation', '*Genes, bcl-2', 'Humans', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/genetics', 'Sequence Alignment']",2000/04/15 09:00,2000/08/29 11:01,['2000/04/15 09:00'],"['2000/04/15 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/08/29 11:01 [medline]', '2000/04/15 09:00 [entrez]']","['10.1074/jbc.M909572199 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(19)79647-1 [pii]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2000 Jul 21;275(29):22136-46. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M909572199.,"['0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)']",,,,['CA57359/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,['GENBANK/AF198614'],,,,,,,,,,

A consensus sequence for Pbx1-HoxA10 DNA binding has been derived, but genuine target genes have not been identified. We noted that the derived Pbx-HoxA10 DNA-binding consensus is similar to a repressor element in the CYBB promoter. The CYBB gene, which encodes the respiratory burst oxidase component gp91(phox), is expressed only in myeloid cells that have differentiated beyond the promyelocyte stage. In these studies, we demonstrate that interferon gamma (IFN-gamma)-induced differentiation of myeloid cell lines abolishes in vitro Pbx-HoxA10 binding to either the derived consensus or the similar CYBB sequence. We also demonstrate that HoxA10, overexpressed in myeloid cell lines, represses reporter gene expression from artificial promoter constructs with Pbx-HoxA10 binding sites. We determine that HoxA10 has endogenous repression domains that are not functionally altered by IFN-gamma treatment. However, IFN-gamma-induced differentiation of myeloid cell lines leads to HoxA10 tyrosine phosphorylation, which decreases in vitro DNA binding to Pbx-HoxA10 binding sites. Therefore, these investigations identify the CYBB gene as a potential target for HoxA10 and define repression of genes expressed in mature myeloid cells as a novel role for HoxA10 during myeloid differentiation.","['Eklund, E A', 'Jalava, A', 'Kakar, R']","['Eklund EA', 'Jalava A', 'Kakar R']","['Lurleen B.

Although tumor Ags can be identified based on cytotoxic T-cell activation, this approach is not readily accomplished for many tumor types. We applied an alternative strategy based on a humoral immune response, SEREX, to the identification of tumor Ags in the murine colon adenocarcinoma cell line MC38. Immunization of syngeneic C57BL/6 mice with MC38 cells by three different methods induced a protective immune response with concomitant production of anti-MC38 antibodies. Immunoscreening of an MC38-derived expression library resulted in the identification of the endogenous ecotropic leukemia virus envelope (env) protein and the murine ATRX protein as candidate tumor Ags. Northern blot analysis demonstrated high levels of expression of the env transcript in MC38 cells and in several other murine tumor cell lines, whereas expression in normal colonic epithelium was absent. ATRX was found to be variably expressed in tumor cell lines and in normal tissue. Further analysis of the expressed env sequence indicated that it represents a nonmutated tumor Ag. Polynucleotide immunization with DNA encoding the env polypeptide resulted in strong and specific antibody responses to this self Ag in all immunized mice. Thus, SEREX offers a rapid means of identifying tumor Ags in murine cancer models.","['Hampton, T A', 'Conry, R M', 'Khazaeli, M B', 'Shaw, D R', 'Curiel, D T', 'LoBuglio, A F', 'Strong, T V']","['Hampton TA', 'Conry RM', 'Khazaeli MB', 'Shaw DR', 'Curiel DT', 'LoBuglio AF', 'Strong TV']","['Gene Therapy Center, and Department of Medicine, University of Alabama at Birmingham, 35294, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Cancer Gene Ther,Cancer gene therapy,9432230,IM,"['Adenocarcinoma/chemistry/*immunology', 'Animals', 'Antibodies, Neoplasm/biosynthesis', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/administration & dosage/immunology/*isolation & purification', 'Base Sequence', 'Blotting, Southern', '*DNA Helicases', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Gene Products, env/biosynthesis/genetics/immunology/isolation & purification', 'Hemolytic Plaque Technique', 'Injections, Subcutaneous', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Inbred DBA', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', '*Nuclear Proteins', 'Polynucleotides/administration & dosage/immunology', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA', 'Transcription Factors/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/transplantation', 'X-linked Nuclear Protein']",2000/04/15 09:00,2000/08/12 11:00,['2000/04/15 09:00'],"['2000/04/15 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/08/12 11:00 [medline]', '2000/04/15 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.cgt.7700124 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Gene Ther. 2000 Mar;7(3):446-55. doi: 10.1038/sj.cgt.7700124.,"['0 (Antibodies, Neoplasm)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Gene Products, env)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Polynucleotides)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', 'EC 3.6.4.- (DNA Helicases)', 'EC 3.6.4.12 (Atrx protein, mouse)', 'EC 3.6.4.12 (X-linked Nuclear Protein)']",,,,['R01CA71386/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have broadened the search for more potent inhibitors and evaluated a large range of mono- and bis-disulfide compounds, prepared using parallel syntheses. Reaction of isothioisourea-HCI salts (R') or bis-salts (R) with aromatic or aryl thiols (R"") in wells of 96-well plates produced >450 derivatives with the structures R""SSR' and R""SSRSSR"". The excellent yield and purity of the disulfides provided sufficient material for evaluations of enzyme inhibition and cytotoxicity. Selection criteria based on the IC50 values for hTrx/TR inhibition and for cytotoxicities of the disulfides identified agents for subsequent scale-up syntheses and in vivo evaluations of antitumor activity. These scale-up studies confirmed the original activities of agents synthesized in the plates and validated the parallel synthetic approach. Structure-activity information derived from the hTrx/TR IC50 data allow for a number of generalizations. The most potent inhibitors of the Trx system contained two heteroatoms ortho to the disulfide moiety in an aromatic functionality. The thioalkylating moieties had greatest activity with one branch point alpha to the disulfide. In the absence of branching, more potent inhibition was observed with the electron withdrawing functionalities. Bis-disulfides showed patterns of activity which depended on chain length, with optimum activity observed when the disulfide units were separated by 3.9 A, a similar distance to that separating the thioredoxin active site cysteine residues. From the agents selected for scale-up syntheses, three disulfide compounds were studied for their antitumor activity in vivo against human tumor xenografts in scid mice. One of the analogues discovered through the combinatorial syntheses/screening for Trx inhibition, 1-phenylethyl 2-imidazolyl disulfide, N1 (ProlX agent PX-C5), has demonstrated excellent in vivo activity against the MCF-7 human breast cancer and the HL-60 human leukemia, thus validating this approach for novel drug discovery.","['Kirkpatrick, D L', 'Watson, S', 'Kunkel, M', 'Fletcher, S', 'Ulhaq, S', 'Powis, G']","['Kirkpatrick DL', 'Watson S', 'Kunkel M', 'Fletcher S', 'Ulhaq S', 'Powis G']","['Department of Chemistry, University of Regina, Canada. kirkpaly@leroy.cc.uregina.ca.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Anticancer Drug Des,Anti-cancer drug design,8603523,IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/chemical synthesis/*pharmacology', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Combinatorial Chemistry Techniques', 'Disulfides/chemical synthesis/*pharmacology', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Mice, SCID', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Thioredoxins/*antagonists & inhibitors/chemistry', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2000/04/15 09:00,2000/04/29 09:00,['2000/04/15 09:00'],"['2000/04/15 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/04/29 09:00 [medline]', '2000/04/15 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Anticancer Drug Des. 1999 Oct;14(5):421-32.,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Disulfides)', '52500-60-4 (Thioredoxins)']",,,,"['CA 78277/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA48725/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA77204/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A mutation (L753F), which renders the human glucocorticoid receptor (hGR) gene functionally hemizygous, was identified in all CEM-derived cell lines analyzed. Allele-specific PCR identified the same mutation in lymph node biopsy material from patient CEM cells. Given the correlation between hGR concentration and glucocorticoid sensitivity, this suggests that loss of functional heterozygosity may result in resistance to glucocorticoid-based chemotherapy. The L753F mutation was probably not responsible for the ontogeny of the disease because it did not appear to be present in all leukemic cells. Thus, it is unlikely that hGR mutations would be detected in leukemic patients at presentation, but they may occur, and be selected for, during treatment. Deletions and point mutations in the hGR gene of cells selected for steroid resistance in vitro were investigated by PCR-single strand conformation polymorphism analysis.

There is compelling evidence that malignant transformation by BCR-ABL is critically dependent on its protein tyrosine kinase (PTK) activity. As a result, multiple signaling pathways are activated in a kinase-dependent manner, and thus the activation of such pathways may affect the expression of genes that confer the malignant phenotype. In this study, we used differential display to investigate the alterations of gene expression in BV173, a CML cell line derived from lymphoid blast crisis, after exposure to ST1571, which selectively inhibits ABL PTK activity. We show that the expression of a set of 12 genes is correlated with the kinase activity and that the profile of these genes reflects mechanisms implicated in the pathogenesis of CML. Several of the genes show a consistent pattern of altered regulation in all Ph-positive lymphoid cell lines, whereas others appear to be unique to BV173 cells. We conclude that BCR-ABL PTK activity drives the expression of specific target genes that contribute to the malignant transformation of Ph-positive cells. The identification of downstream molecules with a consistent regulation pattern may provide suitable targets for therapeutic intervention in the future.","['Deininger, M W', 'Vieira, S', 'Mendiola, R', 'Schultheis, B', 'Goldman, J M', 'Melo, J V']","['Deininger MW', 'Vieira S', 'Mendiola R', 'Schultheis B', 'Goldman JM', 'Melo JV']","['Department of Haematology, Imperial College School of Medicine, Hammersmith Hospital, London, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/toxicity', 'Blast Crisis/genetics', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*metabolism', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*genetics/pathology', 'Philadelphia Chromosome', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Pyrimidines/toxicity', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Signal Transduction', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2000/04/15 00:00,2000/04/15 00:01,['2000/04/15 00:00'],"['2000/04/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '2000/04/15 00:01 [medline]', '2000/04/15 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 2000 Apr 1;60(7):2049-55.,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In our previous study (H. Ohguro et al., Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis.

Therefore, we suggested that autoimmune reactions against both recoverin and hsc 70 might be involved in the pathogenesis of CAR. To elucidate the initial step of the molecular pathology of CAR, we examined the expression of recoverin and hsc 70 by reverse transcription-PCR and Western blot using cell lines of several kinds of cancers, including lung small cell carcinoma, lung adenocarcinoma, gastric cancer, pancreatic cancer, breast cancer, uterine cervical cancer, endometrial cancer, and leukemia. Recoverin was expressed in 21 of the 31 cancer cell lines. The expression levels of hsc 70 were significantly higher in cancer cell lines than in noncancerous cell lines. However, no difference in the expression levels of hsc 70 was observed between recoverin-positive and -negative cell lines. Immunofluorescence labeling by the affinity-purified recoverin antibody revealed the immunoreactivity to recoverin as a granular pattern within the cancer cells. Lung adenocarcinoma A549 cells, which did not express recoverin, exhibited a significant reduction in cell proliferation upon transfection with human recoverin cDNA. Taken together, our present data suggest that the retina-specific calcium-binding protein recoverin is expressed in more than 50% of a variety of cancer cells and may play a significant role in the cell proliferation of these tumor cells.","['Maeda, A', 'Ohguro, H', 'Maeda, T', 'Wada, I', 'Sato, N', 'Kuroki, Y', 'Nakagawa, T']","['Maeda A', 'Ohguro H', 'Maeda T', 'Wada I', 'Sato N', 'Kuroki Y', 'Nakagawa T']","['Department of Ophthalmology, Sapporo Medical University School of Medicine, Japan. ooguro@sapmed.ac.jp']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,IM,"['Antigens, Neoplasm/*genetics', 'Base Sequence', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/genetics', 'Calcium-Binding Proteins/*genetics', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Line, Transformed', '*Eye Proteins', 'Female', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'HSP70 Heat-Shock Proteins/genetics', 'Hippocalcin', 'Humans', '*Lipoproteins', 'Molecular Sequence Data', '*Nerve Tissue Proteins', 'Recombinant Proteins/biosynthesis', 'Recoverin', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2000/04/15 00:00,2000/04/15 00:01,['2000/04/15 00:00'],"['2000/04/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '2000/04/15 00:01 [medline]', '2000/04/15 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 2000 Apr 1;60(7):1914-20.,"['0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Calcium-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Eye Proteins)', '0 (HSP70 Heat-Shock Proteins)', '0 (Lipoproteins)', '0 (Nerve Tissue Proteins)', '0 (RCVRN protein, human)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '135844-11-0 (Recoverin)', '149223-81-4 (Hippocalcin)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Flt3-L is a trans-membrane protein (tm) but can be proteolytically cleaved to a soluble form, which is also biologically active. In this study, the antitumor effect of both soluble and tmFlt3-L was evaluated in a mouse leukemia model. To mimic the multiorgan involvement characteristic of human leukemia, a factor-dependent cell line FDC.P1 was made leukemogenic by transfection with the human BCR/ABL gene. The resulting cell line, AW, expresses BCR/ABL RNA and protein. It maintains a similar in vitro growth rate as the parent cell line, but unlike the parent cell line, AW cells are factor independent and tumorigenic. Growth of FDC.P1 and AW cells are unaffected by the addition of soluble human Flt3-L to the culture medium. Also, AW growth is unaltered after transduction with a retroviral vector expressing the tm isoform of human Flt3-L (AW/tmFlt3-L). When 10(5) AW cells were i.v. injected into syngeneic DBA/2 mice, fatal leukemia developed in nine of nine (100%) mice within 4-6 weeks with involvement of the blood, bone marrow, spleen, and thymus. Systematic administration of soluble human Flt3-L (500 microg/kg/day) for 10 days protected mice from leukemia, with 11 of 17 mice tumor free at week 8 (64.7%) The tm isoform of Flt3-L also was protective. When 10(4) AW/tmFlt3-L cells were injected i.v. into mice, only 35.7% (5 of 14) developed leukemia versus 100% in control groups. Adoptive transfer of immunity was also demonstrated; T cells obtained from tumor-free animals conferred protection to 87% (seven of eight) naive mice challenged with AW cells. These results demonstrate that both soluble and membrane-bound human Flt3-L has antitumor activity in this leukemia model.","['Wang, A', 'Braun, S E', 'Sonpavde, G', 'Cornetta, K']","['Wang A', 'Braun SE', 'Sonpavde G', 'Cornetta K']","['Department of Microbiology/Immunology, Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis 46202, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,IM,"['Animals', 'Anticarcinogenic Agents/therapeutic use/*toxicity', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'Female', '*Genes, abl', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Experimental/pathology/*prevention & control', 'Membrane Proteins/*genetics/therapeutic use/*toxicity', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred DBA', 'Protein Isoforms/genetics/therapeutic use/toxicity', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/drug effects/physiology', 'Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/drug effects/physiology', 'Recombinant Proteins/metabolism/therapeutic use/toxicity', 'Transfection', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3']",2000/04/15 00:00,2000/04/15 00:01,['2000/04/15 00:00'],"['2000/04/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '2000/04/15 00:01 [medline]', '2000/04/15 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 2000 Apr 1;60(7):1895-900.,"['0 (Anticarcinogenic Agents)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Protein Isoforms)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (flt3 ligand protein)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Flt3 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)']",,,,['P50 DK49218/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We show here that this antiangiogenic schedule avoided drug resistance and eradicated Lewis lung carcinoma and L1210 leukemia, an outcome not possible with the conventional schedule. When Lewis lung carcinoma and EMT-6 breast cancer were made drug resistant before therapy, the antiangiogenic schedule suppressed tumor growth 3-fold more effectively than the conventional schedule. When another angiogenesis inhibitor, TNP-470, was added to the antiangiogenic schedule of cyclophosphamide, drug-resistant Lewis lung carcinomas were eradicated. Each dose of the antiangiogenic schedule of cyclophosphamide induced the apoptosis of endothelial cells within tumors, and endothelial cell apoptosis preceded the apoptosis of drug-resistant tumor cells. This antiangiogenic effect was more pronounced in p53-null mice in which the apoptosis of p53-null endothelial cells induced by cyclophosphamide was so vigorous that drug-resistant tumors comprising 4.5% of body weight were eradicated. Thus, by using a dosing schedule of cyclophosphamide that provided more sustained apoptosis of endothelial cells within the vascular bed of a tumor, we show that a chemotherapeutic agent can more effectively control tumor growth in mice, regardless of whether the tumor cells are drug resistant.","['Browder, T', 'Butterfield, C E', 'Kraling, B M', 'Shi, B', 'Marshall, B', ""O'Reilly, M S"", 'Folkman, J']","['Browder T', 'Butterfield CE', 'Kraling BM', 'Shi B', 'Marshall B', ""O'Reilly MS"", 'Folkman J']","[""Children's Hospital, Department of Pediatric Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, Massachusetts 02115, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cornea/blood supply', 'Cyclophosphamide/administration & dosage/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Drug Carriers', 'Drug Resistance, Multiple', 'Female', 'Fluorouracil/therapeutic use', 'Genes, p53', 'Leukemia L1210/*drug therapy', 'Liposomes', 'Lung Neoplasms/blood supply/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Male', 'Mammary Neoplasms, Experimental/blood supply/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred Strains', 'Neovascularization, Pathologic/*prevention & control', 'Neovascularization, Physiologic/*drug effects', 'Thioinosine/administration & dosage/therapeutic use']",2000/04/15 00:00,2000/04/15 00:01,['2000/04/15 00:00'],"['2000/04/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '2000/04/15 00:01 [medline]', '2000/04/15 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 2000 Apr 1;60(7):1878-86.,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Drug Carriers)', '0 (Liposomes)', '46S541971T (Thioinosine)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'U3P01618RT (Fluorouracil)']",,,,['P01 CA45548/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The purpose of this study was to identify genes that are regulated in a PML-RARalpha-dependent fashion by retinoic acid (RA), because such genes may be integrally involved in APL pathogenesis and/or myeloid differentiation. A cDNA microarray approach was used to identify genes induced in response to RA in TF1 myeloid leukemia cells expressing PML-RARalpha (TF1-PR cells). The B94 gene (TNFAIP2; Unigene Hs.101382), originally identified as a tumor necrosis factor alpha-inducible gene in endothelial cells, was one of several genes found to be induced by RA specifically in TF1-PR cells, but not in TF1-neo (control) cells. The induction of B94 was most pronounced in cells expressing the PML-RARalpha short isoform and was negligible in cells that expressed a mutant PML-RARalpha protein containing a deletion of the PML coiled-coil domain. B94 induction by RA occurred within 1 h, did not require new protein synthesis, and was inhibited by actinomycin D, suggesting rapid transcriptional activation. B94 was also induced by RA in NB4, UF1, and HL-60 cells, but not in other hematopoietic cell lines tested, suggesting that its up-regulation by RA may be specific to cells that express PML-RARalpha or are at the late myeloblast or promyelocyte stage of myeloid development. A screen of bone marrow cells from normal donors or patients with acute myelogenous leukemia showed that B94 was highly expressed in normal marrow and in marrow from patients with acute myelogenous leukemia French-American-British subtypes M0-M2, but was repressed in marrow cells from APL patients. Treatment of APL blasts in vitro with all-trans-RA resulted in up-regulation of B94 mRNA. These results suggest that B94 plays a role in myeloid development and support the hypothesis that B94 is a target gene of PML-RARalpha in APL.","['Rusiniak, M E', 'Yu, M', 'Ross, D T', 'Tolhurst, E C', 'Slack, J L']","['Rusiniak ME', 'Yu M', 'Ross DT', 'Tolhurst EC', 'Slack JL']","['Department of Medicine, Roswell Park Cancer Institute, Buffalo, New York 14263, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,IM,"['Bone Marrow Cells/pathology', 'Cytokines/*genetics', 'Female', 'Fetus', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/pathology', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/blood/*genetics/pathology', 'Male', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/genetics', 'Tretinoin/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/pharmacology']",2000/04/15 00:00,2000/04/15 00:01,['2000/04/15 00:00'],"['2000/04/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '2000/04/15 00:01 [medline]', '2000/04/15 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 2000 Apr 1;60(7):1824-9.,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (TNFAIP2 protein, human)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '0 (promyelocytic leukemia-retinoic acid receptor alpha fusion oncoprotein)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)']",,,,['CA75049/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Six FS patients, 5 LGL syndrome patients, and 13 elderly controls were studied. CD8+,CD57+ T cells were cocultured with cord blood-derived stem cells, and percentage inhibition was calculated. Recombinant chemokines and Fas-stimulating molecules were used in separate cultures to address possible mechanisms of suppression. Proliferation after stimulation with interleukin-2 (IL-2) and anti-CD3 was assessed. RESULTS: Significant (79%) suppression of colony-forming unit-granulocyte-macrophage (CFU-GM) by the CD8+,CD57+ subset was shown by 1 FS patient. None of the CD8+,CD57+ cells from LGL syndrome patients had any effect. Six of 13 controls studied showed >40% inhibition of CFU-GM, and all but 2 showed at least some suppression. The suppressive effect was not mediated by Fas/Fas ligand interactions or by the chemokines macrophage inhibitory protein 1alpha or IL-8. LGL from both patients and controls were largely CD28- and had reduced proliferative capacity. CONCLUSION: In a subset of FS patients, expansion of CD8+,CD57+ T cells in the bone marrow may be responsible for neutropenia by suppressing neutrophil precursors. This effect is also seen with normal LGL, which are likely to have an important function in neutrophil homeostasis.","['Coakley, G', 'Iqbal, M', 'Brooks, D', 'Panayi, G S', 'Lanchbury, J S']","['Coakley G', 'Iqbal M', 'Brooks D', 'Panayi GS', 'Lanchbury JS']","[""Guy's, King's and St. Thomas' Hospitals School of Medicine, London, UK.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Arthritis Rheum,Arthritis and rheumatism,0370605,IM,"['Aged/*physiology', 'CD57 Antigens/*blood', '*CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/physiology', 'Cell Division', 'Felty Syndrome/complications', 'Fetal Blood/cytology', 'Granulocytes/cytology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/complications', 'Macrophages/cytology', 'Neutropenia/etiology', 'Neutrophils/*cytology', 'Stem Cells', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology']",2000/04/15 09:00,2000/05/20 09:00,['2000/04/15 09:00'],"['2000/04/15 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/05/20 09:00 [medline]', '2000/04/15 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/1529-0131(200004)43:4<834::AID-ANR14>3.0.CO;2-H [doi]'],ppublish,Arthritis Rheum. 2000 Apr;43(4):834-43. doi: 10.1002/1529-0131(200004)43:4<834::AID-ANR14>3.0.CO;2-H.,['0 (CD57 Antigens)'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In tandem with the new scientific understanding, there have been evolutionary changes in regulatory risk assessment guidelines, that encourage flexibility and greater use of scientific information. The results of an updated meta-analysis of the findings from 10 unique EO study cohorts from five countries, including nearly 33,000 workers, and over 800 cancers are presented, indicating that EO does not cause increased risk of cancers overall or of brain, stomach or pancreatic cancers. The findings for leukemia and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) are inconclusive. Two studies with the requisite attributes of size, individual exposure estimates and follow up are the basis for dose-response modeling and added lifetime risk predictions under environmental and occupational exposure scenarios and a variety of plausible alternative assumptions. A point of departure analysis, with various margins of exposure, is also illustrated using human data. The two datasets produce remarkably similar leukemia added risk predictions, orders of magnitude lower than prior animal-based predictions under conservative, default assumptions, with risks on the order of 1 x 10(-6) or lower for exposures in the low ppb range. Inconsistent results for ""lymphoid"" tumors, a non-standard grouping using histologic information from death certificates, are discussed. This assessment demonstrates the applicability of the current risk assessment paradigm to epidemiological data.","['Teta, M J', 'Sielken, R L Jr', 'Valdez-Flores, C']","['Teta MJ', 'Sielken RL Jr', 'Valdez-Flores C']","['Union Carbide Corporation, Danbury, CT 06817-0001, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Meta-Analysis', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Risk Anal,Risk analysis : an official publication of the Society for Risk Analysis,8109978,IM,"['Animals', 'Carcinogens/administration & dosage/*adverse effects', 'Cohort Studies', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Ethylene Oxide/administration & dosage/*adverse effects', 'Guidelines as Topic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/chemically induced/epidemiology', 'Mutagens/adverse effects', 'Neoplasms/*chemically induced/*epidemiology', 'Occupational Exposure', 'Risk Assessment']",2000/04/15 09:00,2000/05/20 09:00,['2000/04/15 09:00'],"['2000/04/15 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/05/20 09:00 [medline]', '2000/04/15 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1023/a:1007086728854 [doi]'],ppublish,Risk Anal. 1999 Dec;19(6):1135-55. doi: 10.1023/a:1007086728854.,"['0 (Carcinogens)', '0 (Mutagens)', 'JJH7GNN18P (Ethylene Oxide)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Following tyrosine phosphorylation, STAT proteins dimerize, translocate into the nucleus, and activate specific target genes. Activation is transient, and down-regulation of STAT signaling occurs within a few hours. In the present study, we show that the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21(WAF1/CIP1/SDI1) inhibits STAT3 transcriptional activation. Following leukemia inhibitory factor stimulation, p21(WAF1/CIP1/SDI1) was found to associate with STAT3 proteins in coimmunoprecipitation and pull down assays. In vivo, overexpression of p21(WAF1/CIP1/SDI1) reduced transcriptional activation by STAT3 proteins but did not modify DNA binding activity. Interestingly, pull down experiments showed that p21(WAF1/CIP1/SDI1) could interact with the CREB-binding coactivator protein, and inhibition of STAT3 activity by p21(WAF1/CIP1/SDI1) did not occur when CREB-binding protein was overexpressed. These results suggest a model by which p21(WAF1/CIP1/SDI1) functions as an inhibitor of STAT3 signaling and highlight a new activity for this cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor.","['Coqueret, O', 'Gascan, H']","['Coqueret O', 'Gascan H']","['INSERM E-9928, 4 Rue Larrey, CHU Angers, 49033 Angers Cedex, France. oliver.coqueret@univ-angers.fr']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'COS Cells', 'CREB-Binding Protein', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21', 'Cyclins/*metabolism/physiology', 'DNA Primers', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*metabolism', 'Nuclear Proteins/physiology', 'Protein Binding', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor', 'Trans-Activators/*metabolism/physiology', 'Transcription, Genetic/physiology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2000/04/15 09:00,2000/08/19 11:00,['2000/04/15 09:00'],"['2000/04/15 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/08/19 11:00 [medline]', '2000/04/15 09:00 [entrez]']","['10.1074/jbc.M001601200 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(19)80135-7 [pii]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2000 Jun 23;275(25):18794-800. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M001601200.,"['0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21)', '0 (Cyclins)', '0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', 'EC 2.3.1.48 (CREB-Binding Protein)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

STUDY DESIGN: In a population of 631 unselected women seeking treatment at an obstetrics and gynecology outpatient clinic, vaginal fluid was obtained by wooden Ayre spatula for wet mounting and pH measurement, by high vaginal swab for culture, and by standardized vaginal rinsing with 2 mL 0.9% sodium chloride solution for measurements of lactate, succinate, interleukin 1beta, interleukin 8, leukemia inhibitory factor, and interleukin 1 receptor antagonist concentrations. Lactate and succinate levels were measured by gas-liquid chromatography and the cytokine concentrations were measured by specific immunoassays. Both univariate analysis (Student t test, Welch test, chi(2) test, and Fisher exact test) and multivariate regression analysis (Cox analysis) were used. RESULTS: Increasing disturbance of the lactobacillary flora (lactobacillary grades I, IIa, IIb, and III) was highly correlated with the presence of Gardnerella vaginalis, Trichomonas vaginalis, enterococci, group B streptococci, and Escherichia coli. Vaginal pH and interleukin 8 and interleukin 1beta concentrations increased linearly with increasing lactobacillary grade, whereas lactate concentrations and the presence of epithelial cell lysis decreased. A similar pattern of associations with increasing leukocyte count was clear, but in addition there was an increase in leukemia inhibitory factor concentration. Multivariate analysis of vaginal leukocytosis, lactobacillary grades, and the presence of positive vaginal culture results showed that interleukin 1beta concentration was most closely related to the lactobacillary grade, leukemia inhibitory factor concentration was most closely related to the lactobacillary grade and positive culture results, interleukin 8 concentration was most closely related to positive culture results, and interleukin 1 receptor antagonist concentration was most closely related to vaginal leukocytosis and positive culture results. The concentration ratio of interleukin 1beta to interleukin 1 receptor antagonist remained stable, except when vaginal leukocytosis increased. In its most severe form, with >10 leukocytes per epithelial cell present, a decompensation of the vaginal flora with a collapse in interleukin 1beta and interleukin 1 receptor antagonist concentrations was seen, but there was a concurrent sharp increase in leukemia inhibitory factor concentration. This pattern was completely different from the course of the cytokine concentrations associated with a lactobacillary grade increase. CONCLUSION: Both disturbed lactobacillary grade and the presence of increasing vaginal leukocytosis were correlated with lactobacillary substrate (lactate) concentration, pH, and the concentrations of a variety of cytokines. There was a remarkably linear increase in these cytokines as either leukocytosis or lactobacillary grade became more severe. In circumstances in which leukocytosis was extreme, however, interleukin 1beta was no longer produced but leukemia inhibitory factor concentrations increased. We speculate that in extreme inflammation the body tries to limit the damage that can be done by exaggerated cytokine production.","['Donders, G G', 'Bosmans, E', 'Dekeersmaecker, A', 'Vereecken, A', 'Van Bulck, B', 'Spitz, B']","['Donders GG', 'Bosmans E', 'Dekeersmaecker A', 'Vereecken A', 'Van Bulck B', 'Spitz B']","['Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Gasthuisberg Hospital, Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, Belgium.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Am J Obstet Gynecol,American journal of obstetrics and gynecology,0370476,IM,"['Animals', 'Bacteria/*isolation & purification', 'Cytokines/metabolism', 'Female', 'Growth Inhibitors/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Hydrogen-Ion Concentration', 'Interleukin 1 Receptor Antagonist Protein', 'Interleukin-1/metabolism', '*Interleukin-6', 'Lactic Acid/metabolism', 'Lactobacillus/classification/isolation & purification', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Leukocytosis/metabolism/pathology', 'Lymphokines/metabolism', 'Osmolar Concentration', 'Sialoglycoproteins/metabolism', 'Vagina/metabolism/*microbiology/pathology']",2000/04/14 09:00,2000/05/16 09:00,['2000/04/14 09:00'],"['2000/04/14 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/05/16 09:00 [medline]', '2000/04/14 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0002-9378(00)70338-3 [pii]', '10.1016/s0002-9378(00)70338-3 [doi]']",ppublish,Am J Obstet Gynecol. 2000 Apr;182(4):872-8. doi: 10.1016/s0002-9378(00)70338-3.,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (IL1RN protein, human)', '0 (Interleukin 1 Receptor Antagonist Protein)', '0 (Interleukin-1)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Sialoglycoproteins)', '33X04XA5AT (Lactic Acid)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with CD25(+) hematologic malignancies for whom standard and salvage therapies failed were treated with LMB-2 at dose levels that ranged from 2 to 63 microg/kg administered intravenously over 30 minutes on alternate days for three doses (QOD x 3). RESULTS: LMB-2 was administered to 35 patients for a total of 59 cycles. Dose-limiting toxicity at the 63 microg/kg level was reversible and included transaminase elevations in one patient and diarrhea and cardiomyopathy in another. LMB-2 was well tolerated in nine patients at the maximum-tolerated dose (40 microg/kg QOD x 3); toxicity was transient and most commonly included transaminase elevations (eight patients) and fever (seven patients). Only six of 35 patients developed significant neutralizing antibodies after the first cycle. The median half-life was 4 hours. One hairy cell leukemia (HCL) patient achieved a complete remission, which is ongoing at 20 months. Seven partial responses were observed in cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (one patient), HCL (three patients), chronic lymphocytic leukemia (one patient), Hodgkin's disease (one patient), and adult T-cell leukemia (one patient). Responding patients had 2 to 5 log reductions of circulating malignant cells, improvement in skin lesions, and regression of lymphomatous masses and splenomegaly. All four patients with HCL responded to treatment. CONCLUSION: LMB-2 has clinical activity in CD25(+) hematologic malignancies and is relatively nonimmunogenic. It is the first recombinant immunotoxin to induce major responses in cancer. LMB-2 and similar agents that target other cancer antigens merit further clinical development.","['Kreitman, R J', 'Wilson, W H', 'White, J D', 'Stetler-Stevenson, M', 'Jaffe, E S', 'Giardina, S', 'Waldmann, T A', 'Pastan, I']","['Kreitman RJ', 'Wilson WH', 'White JD', 'Stetler-Stevenson M', 'Jaffe ES', 'Giardina S', 'Waldmann TA', 'Pastan I']","['Laboratory of Clinical Pathology, Metabolism Branch, Medicine Branch, and Biopharmaceutical Development Program, Science Applications International Corporation Frederick, National Cancer Institute, National Institute of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Clinical Trial, Phase I', 'Journal Article']",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antibodies/analysis', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Exotoxins', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunotoxins/adverse effects/immunology/pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy/immunology', 'Lymphoma/*drug therapy/immunology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Receptors, Interleukin-2/analysis']",2000/04/14 09:00,2000/05/20 09:00,['2000/04/14 09:00'],"['2000/04/14 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/05/20 09:00 [medline]', '2000/04/14 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1200/JCO.2000.18.8.1622 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2000 Apr;18(8):1622-36. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2000.18.8.1622.,"['0 (Antibodies)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (B3(Fv)-PE38KDEL recombinant immunotoxin)', '0 (Exotoxins)', '0 (Immunotoxins)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-2)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

One of these factors, leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), a member of the interleukin-6 family of cytokines, is expressed in embryonic and neonatal cardiomyocytes and induces cardiomyocyte hypertrophy. Many aspects of embryogenesis are faithfully recapitulated during in vitro differentiation of embryonic stem cells in embryoid bodies. We exploited this model to study effects of growth factors on commitment and differentiation of cardiomyocytes and on maintenance of their phenotype. We identified LIF as a factor affecting commitment and differentiation of cardiomyocytes in an opposite manner. Diffusible LIF inhibited mesoderm formation and hampered commitment of cardiomyocytes. Lack of both the diffusible and matrix-bound isoforms of LIF in lif-/- embryoid bodies did not interfere with commitment, but it severely suppressed early differentiation of cardiomyocytes. Onset of differentiation was rescued by very low concentrations of diffusible LIF; however, consecutive differentiation was attenuated in a concentration-dependent manner by diffusible LIF both in wild-type and lif-/- cardiomyocytes. Differentiation of cardiomyocytes was severely hampered but not completely blocked in lifr-/- embryoid bodies, suggesting additional, LIF-receptor ligand independent pathways for commitment and differentiation of cardiomyocytes. At the fully differentiated state, both paracrine and autocrine LIF promoted proliferation and increased longevity of cardiomyocytes. These findings suggest that both paracrine and autocrine and both diffusible and matrix-bound isoforms of LIF contribute to the modulation of cardiogenesis in a subtle, opposite, and developmental stage-dependent manner and control proliferation and maintenance of the differentiated state of cardiomyocytes.","['Bader, A', 'Al-Dubai, H', 'Weitzer, G']","['Bader A', 'Al-Dubai H', 'Weitzer G']","['Institute of Biochemistry, Medical Faculty, University of Vienna, Austria.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Circ Res,Circulation research,0047103,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Aggregation/drug effects', '*Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Fibroblasts/cytology/physiology', 'Growth Inhibitors/genetics/pharmacology/*physiology', 'Heart/*embryology', '*Interleukin-6', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Lymphokines/genetics/pharmacology/*physiology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Myocardium/*cytology', 'Stem Cells/*cytology/drug effects/physiology', 'Time Factors']",2000/04/14 00:00,2000/05/20 00:00,['2000/04/14 00:00'],"['2000/04/14 00:00 [pubmed]', '2000/05/20 00:00 [medline]', '2000/04/14 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1161/01.res.86.7.787 [doi]'],ppublish,Circ Res. 2000 Apr 14;86(7):787-94. doi: 10.1161/01.res.86.7.787.,"['0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', '0 (Lymphokines)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In parallel with new therapeutic modalities, more sensitive diagnostic methods are needed. These methods should be highly sensitive in detecting very low amounts of malignant cells and should be specific for the malignant clone. In addition, these methods should allow the quantification of residual tumor cells. In this study a new real-time polymerase chain reaction (LightCycler) was evaluated to quantify residual tumor cells in monoclonal B cell malignancies. This technology combines the advantages of rapid cycling PCR with the online detection of PCR products using fluorescent dyes. Our assay is based on immunoglobulin heavy chain (IgVH)-specific PCR with allele-specific primers complementary to hypervariable CDRII and CDRIII regions. A set of framework region III (FRIII)-specific hybridization probes was used for detection of the specific amplification product, and IgVH copy number was quantified with the cloned IgVH sequence as an external standard. The approach was evaluated with the Hodgkin lymphoma cell line L428 in order to quantify L428 dilutions. L428 cells mixed with peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMNCs) were detected and quantified with a sensitivity of one cell within 1 x 10(5) PBMNCs. Sample DNA from the peripheral blood and from the bone marrow of two patients with B-CLL was analyzed in the new set up at different time points before and after therapy.

A 'three disease' model for HD that incorporates the EBV association, histological subtype of HD and age has recently been proposed. In this model, Hodgkin's disease of childhood and older adults is commonly EBV-associated and of mixed cellularity type, whereas young adult HD is generally not EBV-associated and is usually characterised by nodular sclerosis disease. A case series of HD diagnosed in the West Midlands between 1981 and 1997, inclusive, was used to investigate the applicability of the 'three disease' model. In situ hybridisation for the EBV early RNAs (EBERs) was used to determine the presence of EBV in the malignant Hodgkin/Reed-Sternberg cells. In contrast to the 'three disease' model, nodular sclerosis was the predominant subtype in each of the age groups within the case series. In addition, overall there was little variation in EBV-positive rates across the age ranges examined. However, when females were analysed separately, older women (45+ years) were significantly more likely to have EBV-positive disease than their younger counterparts (<45 years). In summary our results do not generally support the 'three disease' model.","['Flavell, K J', 'Biddulph, J P', 'Constandinou, C M', 'Lowe, D', 'Scott, K', 'Crocker, J', 'Young, L S', 'Murray, P G']","['Flavell KJ', 'Biddulph JP', 'Constandinou CM', 'Lowe D', 'Scott K', 'Crocker J', 'Young LS', 'Murray PG']","['School of Health Sciences, University of Wolverhampton, UK.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age Distribution', 'Aged', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Epstein-Barr Virus Infections/*epidemiology', 'Female', '*Herpesvirus 4, Human/isolation & purification', 'Hodgkin Disease/classification/*epidemiology/pathology/virology', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Registries', 'Retrospective Studies', 'United Kingdom/epidemiology']",2000/04/14 09:00,2000/05/08 09:00,['2000/04/14 09:00'],"['2000/04/14 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/05/08 09:00 [medline]', '2000/04/14 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2401724 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 2000 Apr;14(4):748-53. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2401724.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Seventeen patients had small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL), 29 had follicular lymphoma (FL), 10 of them with histologic transformation. I-HDS included: (1) tumor debulking, by 2 APO+2 DHAP courses; (2) sequential administration of high-dose (hd) etoposide, methotrexate, and cyclophosphamide, followed by peripheral blood progenitor cell (PBPC) harvest; (3) hd-mitoxantrone + melphalan with PBPC autograft. Ten FL patients had their PBPC immunologically purged ex vivo. There were two treatment-related deaths; five FL patients had short-lasting response followed by disease progression, five SLL reached a stable PR; overall, 34 patients (74%) reached CR. At a median follow-up of 4.3 years, the estimated 9-year OS and EFS were 84% and 45%, respectively. No significant differences were observed in the OS among patients at low, intermediate or high IPI score, with an estimated OS projection of 95%, 78%, and 75%, respectively. FL had longer survival without evidence of residual disease (9-year EFS: 59%) as compared to SLL patients (8.8-year EFS: 17%); however, both groups had prolonged survival and no need of salvage treatment, as shown by the time to disease progression curve, projected to 66% and 62% for SLL and FL, respectively. The results indicate that hd-approach in low-grade lymphoma: (1) is associated with longer progression-free survival as compared to conventional therapies; (2) may imply higher tumor mass reduction in FL as compared to SLL patients; (3) offers long life expectancy, with potential survival benefits at least for patients at intermediate/high IPI score.","['Tarella, C', 'Caracciolo, D', 'Corradini, P', 'Zallio, F', 'Ladetto, M', 'Cuttica, A', 'Rossi, G', 'Novero, D', 'Gavarotti, P', 'Pileri, A']","['Tarella C', 'Caracciolo D', 'Corradini P', 'Zallio F', 'Ladetto M', 'Cuttica A', 'Rossi G', 'Novero D', 'Gavarotti P', 'Pileri A']","['Dipartimento di Medicina e Oncologia Sperimentale, Azienda Ospedaliera S Giovanni Battista di Torino, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Adult', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Cisplatin/administration & dosage', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Cyclophosphamide/administration & dosage', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage', 'Dexamethasone/administration & dosage', 'Disease Progression', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Doxorubicin/administration & dosage', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Etoposide/administration & dosage', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/drug therapy/mortality/*therapy', 'Lymphoma, Follicular/drug therapy/mortality/*therapy', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/drug therapy/mortality/*therapy', 'Male', 'Melphalan/administration & dosage', 'Methotrexate/administration & dosage', 'Middle Aged', 'Mitoxantrone/administration & dosage', 'Remission Induction', 'Survival Analysis', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Vincristine/administration & dosage']",2000/04/14 09:00,2000/05/08 09:00,['2000/04/14 09:00'],"['2000/04/14 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/05/08 09:00 [medline]', '2000/04/14 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2401737 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 2000 Apr;14(4):740-7. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2401737.,"['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'BZ114NVM5P (Mitoxantrone)', 'Q20Q21Q62J (Cisplatin)', 'Q41OR9510P (Melphalan)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)', 'APO protocol 2', 'DHAP protocol']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The maintenance in hypoxic cultures of progenitors detectable by marrow-repopulating ability (MRA) assay was 18% for MRAcell progenitors and 69% for MRACFU progenitors. Thus, the repopulation of hypoxic cultures with cells or CFU-GM closely reflected the presence of progenitors capable of repopulating, with cells or CFU-GM, the bone marrow of lethally irradiated syngeneic animals. Progenitors repopulating hypoxic cultures were, like MRA progenitors, significantly resistant to 5-fluorouracil, progenitors repopulating cultures with CFU-GM being two-fold more resistant than those repopulating cultures with cells. We concluded that the repopulation of day-14 hypoxic cultures occurring after their transfer to air is to be considered an indicator of the maintenance of MRA progenitors in hypoxia.

Single human cord blood CD34+CD38- cells were individually cultured by micromanipulation with interleukin (IL)-3, stem cell factor (SCF), fIt3 ligand (FL), IL-6 and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF). About 10% of the cells formed primary colonies, which were individually tested for myeloid and B-lymphoid potentials by reculturing aliquots of the primary colony cells into secondary myeloid and B-lymphoid cultures. One third of the primary colonies proved capable of differentiation into CD19+IgM+ cells, as well as into myeloid lineage cells. RT-PCR analyses revealed that some cells in the primary culture had already matured to express B cell-specific transcripts. Thus, the combination of IL-3, SCF, FL, IL-6 and G-CSF supported the differentiation of CD34+CD38- lymphohematopoietic progenitors toward B cell lineage in addition to myeloid lineages. Screening of cytokines to identify the minimum requirement of cytokines in the primary culture revealed that IL-3 and SCF were essential and that the addition of FL, and to a lesser extent IL-6 or G-CSF, to the combination of IL3 and SCF remarkably enhanced the primary colony formation and the generation of CD19+ cells in the secondary B-lymphoid culture.","['Yoshikawa, Y', 'Hirayama, F', 'Kanai, M', 'Nakajo, S', 'Ohkawara, J', 'Fujihara, M', 'Yamaguchi, M', 'Sato, N', 'Kasai, M', 'Sekiguchi, S', 'Ikebuchi, K']","['Yoshikawa Y', 'Hirayama F', 'Kanai M', 'Nakajo S', 'Ohkawara J', 'Fujihara M', 'Yamaguchi M', 'Sato N', 'Kasai M', 'Sekiguchi S', 'Ikebuchi K']","['Hokkaido Red Cross Blood Center, Sapporo, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Antigens, CD34/analysis', 'B-Lymphocytes/*cytology', 'Biomarkers', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Lineage', 'Fetal Blood/*cytology', 'Gene Rearrangement, B-Lymphocyte, Heavy Chain', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/pharmacology', '*Hematopoiesis/drug effects', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*cytology/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin mu-Chains/genetics', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Interleukin-3/pharmacology', 'Interleukin-6/pharmacology', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Recombinant Proteins/pharmacology', 'Stem Cell Factor/pharmacology', 'Stromal Cells/cytology']",2000/04/14 09:00,2000/05/08 09:00,['2000/04/14 09:00'],"['2000/04/14 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/05/08 09:00 [medline]', '2000/04/14 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2401713 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 2000 Apr;14(4):727-34. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2401713.,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (Immunoglobulin mu-Chains)', '0 (Interleukin-3)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Stem Cell Factor)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

By reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), these cells were found to spontaneously express inducible NOS (iNOS)-specific mRNA, but not endothelial constitutive NOS (ecNOS) mRNA. The iNOS protein was detected by immunofluorescence in the cytoplasm of permeabilized leukemic cells and ESKOL cells, using different anti-iNOS monoclonal antibodies. A protein of 135 kDa was identified by Western blotting in ESKOL and HCL lysates, confirming the presence of an iNOS in these cells. Cytosolic homogenates displayed NOS catalytic activity, as measured by the conversion of 14C-labelled L-arginine into 14C L-citrulline and by detection in situ using the DAF-2DA (diaminofluorescein diacetate) NO-sensitive fluorescent probe. Ligation of CD23 (low affinity IgE receptor) was found to increase iNOS expression in ESKOL and conversely to decrease the percentage of cells undergoing apoptosis, as measured by the percentage of cells expressing annexin V. These results indicate that, as in chronic B cell lymphocytic leukemia cells (B-CLL) a functional iNOS is expressed constitutively in hairy cells that contributes to protecting these tumoral cells from apoptosis.","['Roman, V', 'Zhao, H', 'Fourneau, J M', 'Marconi, A', 'Dugas, N', 'Dugas, B', 'Sigaux, F', 'Kolb, J P']","['Roman V', 'Zhao H', 'Fourneau JM', 'Marconi A', 'Dugas N', 'Dugas B', 'Sigaux F', 'Kolb JP']","['INSERM U365, Institut Curie, Paris, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Amidines/pharmacology', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/immunology/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis', 'Arginine/metabolism', 'Benzylamines/pharmacology', 'Blotting, Western', 'Enzyme Induction', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Fluorescent Dyes', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Hairy Cell/enzymology/pathology', 'Microscopy, Fluorescence', 'Neoplasm Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*enzymology/pathology', 'Nitric Oxide/physiology', 'Nitric Oxide Synthase/analysis/antagonists & inhibitors/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Nitric Oxide Synthase Type II', 'Nitric Oxide Synthase Type III', 'Nitrites/analysis', 'Receptors, IgE/immunology/physiology', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/enzymology/pathology', 'omega-N-Methylarginine/pharmacology']",2000/04/14 09:00,2000/05/08 09:00,['2000/04/14 09:00'],"['2000/04/14 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/05/08 09:00 [medline]', '2000/04/14 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2401702 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 2000 Apr;14(4):696-705. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2401702.,"['0 (Amidines)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Benzylamines)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Fluorescent Dyes)', '0 (N-(3-(aminomethyl)benzyl)acetamidine)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nitrites)', '0 (Receptors, IgE)', '27JT06E6GR (omega-N-Methylarginine)', '31C4KY9ESH (Nitric Oxide)', '94ZLA3W45F (Arginine)', 'EC 1.14.13.39 (NOS2 protein, human)', 'EC 1.14.13.39 (NOS3 protein, human)', 'EC 1.14.13.39 (Nitric Oxide Synthase)', 'EC 1.14.13.39 (Nitric Oxide Synthase Type II)', 'EC 1.14.13.39 (Nitric Oxide Synthase Type III)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Over a period of 15 years, we studied the regeneration of CD10+, TdT+, and CD10+/TdT+ cells in BM of children with (CD10+) precursor-B-ALL during and after treatment according to three different treatment protocols of the Dutch Childhood Leukemia Study Group (DCLSG) which differed both in medication and time schedule. This study included a total of 634 BM samples from 46 patients who remained in continuous complete remission (CCR) after treatment according to DCLSG protocols VI (1984-1988; n = 8), VII (1988-1991; n = 10) and VIII (1991-1997; n = 28). After the cytomorphologically defined state of complete remission with CD10+ and CD10+/TdT+ frequencies generally below 1% of total BM cells, a 10-fold increase in precursor-B-cells was observed in protocol VII and protocol VIII, but not in protocol VI. At first sight this precursor-B-cell regeneration during treatment resembled the massive regeneration of the precursor-B-cell compartment after maintenance treatment, and appeared to be related to the post-induction or post-central nervous system (CNS) therapy stops in protocols VII and VIII. However, careful evaluation of the distribution between the 'more mature' (CD10+/TdT-) and the 'immature' (CD10+/TdT+) precursor-B-cells revealed major differences between the post-induction/post-re-induction precursor-B-cell regeneration (low 'mature/immature' ratio: generally <1.0), the post-CNS treatment regeneration (moderate 'mature/immature' ratio: 1.2-2.8), and the post-maintenance regeneration (high 'mature/ immature' ratio: 5.7-7.6). We conclude that a therapy stop of approximately 2 weeks is already sufficient to induce significant precursor-B-cell regeneration even from aplastic BM after induction treatment. Moreover, differences in precursor-B-cell regeneration patterns are related to the intensity of the preceding treatment block, with lower 'mature/immature' ratios after the highly intensive treatment blocks. This information is essential for a correct interpretation of flow cytometric immunophenotyping results of BM samples during follow-up of leukemia patients. Particularly in precursor-B-ALL patients, regeneration of normal precursor-B-cells should not be mistaken for a relapse.","['van Lochem, E G', 'Wiegers, Y M', 'van den Beemd, R', 'Hahlen, K', 'van Dongen, J J', 'Hooijkaas, H']","['van Lochem EG', 'Wiegers YM', 'van den Beemd R', 'Hahlen K', 'van Dongen JJ', 'Hooijkaas H']","['Department of Immunology, University Hospital Rotterdam/Erasmus University Rotterdam, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Asparaginase/administration & dosage/pharmacology', 'B-Lymphocytes/*drug effects/pathology', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/analysis', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Child', 'DNA Nucleotidylexotransferase/analysis', 'Dexamethasone/administration & dosage/pharmacology', 'Drug Evaluation', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Hematopoiesis/*drug effects', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Male', 'Microscopy', 'Neoplasm Proteins/analysis', 'Neoplasm, Residual', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/drug effects/pathology', 'Neprilysin/analysis', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/*pathology', 'Vincristine/administration & dosage/pharmacology']",2000/04/14 09:00,2000/05/08 09:00,['2000/04/14 09:00'],"['2000/04/14 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/05/08 09:00 [medline]', '2000/04/14 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2401749 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 2000 Apr;14(4):688-95. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2401749.,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)', 'EC 2.7.7.31 (DNA Nucleotidylexotransferase)', 'EC 3.4.24.11 (Neprilysin)', 'EC 3.5.1.1 (Asparaginase)', 'ALL-VI protocol']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Differences in presenting features, as well as treatment outcome, were compared between children aged 12 months or less (n = 28) or 13 to 24 months (n = 28) and those more than 24 months of age (n = 243). Children in the two youngest groups (24 months of age or less) had similar presenting features and treatment outcome.

Leukocyte count and 11q23 translocations other than the t(9;11) lacked prognostic significance.

In this study we compared 18 samples with FIt3/ITDs and 63 AML samples without these mutations with respect to clinical prognosis, cytokine responsiveness, progenitor cell content and repopulation in the NOD/SCID mouse. We found that in patients with a mutation CR rates are reduced (P=0.03) and relapse rates are increased (P=0.01), indicating the prognostic importance of FIt3/ITDs. This is also emphasized by the finding that in patients under the age of 60 years, as well as in older patients the event-free survival was more unfavorable for the mutant patients (P=0.003 and P=0.03, respectively). At diagnosis FIt3/ITD and non-mutant AML bone marrow samples did not differ in their progenitor/stem cell frequencies. Cobblestone area forming cell (CAFC) subsets showed a similar frequency distribution in mutant and non-mutant samples. In 7-day liquid cultures, FIt3/ITD samples showed a reduced growth in response to a variety of myeloid growth factors. In contrast, FIt3/ITD samples displayed a higher ability to engraft the NOD/SCID bone marrow with leukemic cells. Together these data show that the FIt3/ITD represents an important diagnostic marker for patient prognosis, and that the presence of these mutations is associated with altered proliferative ability of progenitors in vivo and in vitro.","['Rombouts, W J', 'Blokland, I', 'Lowenberg, B', 'Ploemacher, R E']","['Rombouts WJ', 'Blokland I', 'Lowenberg B', 'Ploemacher RE']","['Dept of Haematology, Erasmus University, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/administration & dosage/therapeutic use', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Cell Count', 'Cell Division/genetics', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', '*Gene Duplication', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/pathology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*genetics/mortality/pathology/therapy', 'Life Tables', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mice, SCID', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*genetics', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/pathology', 'Prognosis', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*genetics', 'Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*genetics', 'Survival Analysis', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Tumor Stem Cell Assay', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3']",2000/04/14 09:00,2000/05/08 09:00,['2000/04/14 09:00'],"['2000/04/14 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/05/08 09:00 [medline]', '2000/04/14 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2401731 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 2000 Apr;14(4):675-83. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2401731.,"['0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Flt3 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To study comparatively the proliferative, differentiative and anti-apoptotic actions of different levels of BCR-ABL proteins in the context of the same cellular background, we have introduced the BCR-ABL gene into the GM-CSF-dependent pluripotent human cell line UT-7. Individual clones expressing BCR-ABL were analyzed by Western blots. After normalization to equivalent levels of endogenous ABL protein, 14 clones always grown in GM-CSF were found to express low but variable levels of BCR-ABL whereas two clones selected in the absence of GM-CSF expressed very high levels of BCR-ABL. All low-level BCR-ABL expressing clones exhibited a behavior similar to that of the GM-CSF-dependent parental cells as they ceased to proliferate upon growth factor deprivation and showed a strong proliferative response upon GM-CSF addition. One out of 14 clones showed progressive GM-CSF independence during culture over several weeks and was found to have a significant increase of BCR-ABL expression at that time. The resistance of this clone (E8-2) to different apoptotic stimuli was found to be increased as compared to its low BCR-ABL-expressing counterpart (E8-1) and similar to that observed in clones with very high levels of BCR-ABL (UT-7/9 and UT-7/11) which were totally resistant to apoptotic stimuli. When injected into nude mice, parental UT-7 cells and clones with low-level of BCR-ABL were not tumorigenic over 10 weeks of observation whereas UT-7 clones with high levels of BCR-ABL (UT-7/9, UT-7/11 and UT-7/E8-2) induced aggressive tumors in 2-4 weeks with a significant correlation between the amount of BCR-ABL protein and the rate of tumor growth. In conclusion, the establishment of an in vitro and in vivo CML model using UT-7 cells suggests for the first time in human cells, that the fully transformed phenotype induced by BCR-ABL requires high levels of BCR-ABL expression. These findings suggest that variable levels of BCR-ABL in primary patient cells could also be responsible for the different phenotypic features seen in chronic and acute phases of CML, such as the differentiation ability induced by growth factors.","['Issaad, C', 'Ahmed, M', 'Novault, S', 'Bonnet, M L', 'Bennardo, T', 'Varet, B', 'Vainchenker, W', 'Turhan, A G']","['Issaad C', 'Ahmed M', 'Novault S', 'Bonnet ML', 'Bennardo T', 'Varet B', 'Vainchenker W', 'Turhan AG']","['INSERM U362, Institut Gustave-Roussy, Villejuif, France.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Division', 'Cell Survival', 'Clone Cells', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/biosynthesis/genetics/*physiology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/pharmacology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/drug effects/metabolism/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Nude', 'Neoplasm Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/physiology', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2000/04/14 09:00,2000/05/08 09:00,['2000/04/14 09:00'],"['2000/04/14 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/05/08 09:00 [medline]', '2000/04/14 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2401730 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 2000 Apr;14(4):662-70. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2401730.,"['0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Increased spleen size in mice injected with G-CSF is a complex genetic trait amenable to investigation in experimental inter-strain crosses by quantitative trait analysis.

Inheritance of a C57BL/6 haplotype in this region was associated with a greater spleen weight.

The constitutively active forms (delta) of all three Raf kinases were fused to the hormone-binding domain of the estrogen receptor (ER), rendering their activities conditionally dependent upon exogenous beta-estradiol. The vast majority of deltaRaf:ER-infected FDC-P1 cells remained cytokine-dependent; however, cells were obtained at low frequency in which expression of deltaRaf:ER abrogated cytokine dependency. Isoform specific differences between the Raf kinases were observed as cytokine-independent cells were obtained more frequently from deltaA-Raf:ER than either deltaRaf-1:ER or deltaB-Raf:ER infected cells. To determine whether the regulatory phosphorylation sites in the Raf proteins were necessary for abrogation of cytokine dependency, they were changed by site-directed mutagenesis. Substitution with phenylalanine eliminated the transforming ability of the deltaB-Raf:ER and deltaRaf-1:ER kinases. However, a similar substitution in A-Raf did not extinguish its transforming activity. The activated Raf proteins induced essential downstream MEK1 activity as treatment with the MEK1 inhibitor, PD98059, suppressed Raf-mediated growth. Activated MAP kinases (ERK1 and ERK2) were detected in deltaRaf:ER-transformed cells, and their presence was dependent upon a functional MEK1 protein. The cytokine-independent phenotype required the continued activity of the deltaRaf:ER proteins as removal of beta-estradiol caused the cells to stop growing and undergo apoptosis. The Raf-responsive cells were found to express autocrine growth factors, which promoted their growth. Constitutive activation of the Raf-1 oncogene resulted in malignant transformation as cytokine-independent FDC-P1 cells infected with a retrovirus encoding an activated Raf-1 protein formed tumors upon injection of immunocompromised mice. In summary, Raf kinases can abrogate cytokine dependency, prevent apoptosis and induce the tumorigenicity of a certain subpopulation of FDC-P1 cells by a MEK1-dependent mechanism.","['Hoyle, P E', 'Moye, P W', 'Steelman, L S', 'Blalock, W L', 'Franklin, R A', 'Pearce, M', 'Cherwinski, H', 'Bosch, E', 'McMahon, M', 'McCubrey, J A']","['Hoyle PE', 'Moye PW', 'Steelman LS', 'Blalock WL', 'Franklin RA', 'Pearce M', 'Cherwinski H', 'Bosch E', 'McMahon M', 'McCubrey JA']","['Department of Microbiology and Immunology, East Carolina University School of Medicine, Greenville, NC 27858, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/*physiology', 'Autocrine Communication', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Line, Transformed', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/genetics', 'Dimethyl Sulfoxide/pharmacology', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Estradiol/pharmacology', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/biosynthesis/genetics/*pharmacology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*cytology', 'Interleukin-3/*pharmacology', 'MAP Kinase Kinase 1', 'MAP Kinase Signaling System/*physiology', 'Mice', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1/metabolism', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 3', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinases/*physiology', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/metabolism', '*Multigene Family', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Isoforms/genetics/*physiology', 'Protein Processing, Post-Translational', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/*physiology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-raf/genetics/*physiology', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/physiology', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Transfection']",2000/04/14 09:00,2000/05/08 09:00,['2000/04/14 09:00'],"['2000/04/14 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/05/08 09:00 [medline]', '2000/04/14 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2401720 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 2000 Apr;14(4):642-56. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2401720.,"['0 (Interleukin-3)', '0 (Protein Isoforms)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '4TI98Z838E (Estradiol)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-raf)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 3)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.12.2 (MAP Kinase Kinase 1)', 'EC 2.7.12.2 (Map2k1 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.12.2 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinases)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)', 'YOW8V9698H (Dimethyl Sulfoxide)']",,,,['R01CA51025/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recently, cytogenetic similarities were noted between elderly de novo AML and secondary AML, suggesting common etiopathogenetic mechanisms. In the present study we analyzed the cytogenetic similarities between patients with AML of different age and patients with MDS consecutively diagnosed during a 5-year period at a single, primary referral, hematologic center. Of 246 patients aged <86 years, 195 (80%) had a cytogenetic study at diagnosis. Informative metaphases were obtained in 182 cases (93%), including 17 (9.3%) with secondary MDS/AML. Patients were classified according to FAB criteria and were subdivided into four groups: (1) 'early MDS': 42 patients with MDS of FAB subtypes other than refractory anemia with excess of blasts (RAEB) or RAEB in transformation (RAEB-T); (2) 'late MDS': 35 patients with RAEB and RAEB-T; (3) 'old AML': 48 patients with AML aged 65 to 85 years; (4) 'young AML': 57 patients with AML aged <65 years. Results showed that 'late MDS' and 'old AML' had striking cytogenetic similarities both in the frequency of normal karyotypes (31% and 27%), single abnormalities (14% and 13%), double abnormalities (17% and 14%), complex karyotypes (37% and 46%), and numerical abnormalities (89% and 93%), as well as in the frequency of rearrangements involving chromosome 5 (20% and 31%) and 7 (27% and 27%). The only difference between the two groups was found in the median number of chromosomes involved in complex karyotypes (5 vs 8; P=0.03). 'Early MDS' had significantly less complex karyotypes (21%; P<0.05), but its cytogenetic features resembled otherwise those of 'late MDS' and 'old AML', and any significant difference disappeared when patients with chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) were excluded. CMML markedly differed from other MDS subtypes in the frequency of normal (57%) and of complex karyotypes (6%). Secondary MDS/AML and AML with trilineage dysplasia shared the same cytogenetic features of 'late MDS' and 'old AML'. 'Young AML' strikingly differed from all other groups, particularly in the higher frequency of balanced translocations (29%; P<0.001) and single karyotype abnormalities (32%; P<0.02), and in the lower frequency of complex karyotypes (19%; P<0.01) and of chromosome 5 (2%; P<0.001) and 7 (9%; P<0.01) involvement. We conclude that in a population-based series of patients, the cytogenetic profile of MDS, particularly of RAEB/RAEB-T, was nearly identical to that of elderly patients with AML both in the frequency and in the type of chromosomal abnormalities. These results support the possibility that MDS and AML of elderly patients may represent the same disease seen at different stages of evolution.","['Rossi, G', 'Pelizzari, A M', 'Bellotti, D', 'Tonelli, M', 'Barlati, S']","['Rossi G', 'Pelizzari AM', 'Bellotti D', 'Tonelli M', 'Barlati S']","['Sezione Ematologia, Spedali Civili, Brescia, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Aging/genetics', 'Anemia, Refractory, with Excess of Blasts/genetics', '*Aneuploidy', 'Cell Lineage', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/genetics', '*Chromosome Aberrations', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*genetics/mortality/pathology', 'Life Tables', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*genetics/mortality/pathology', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/genetics/mortality/pathology', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Analysis']",2000/04/14 09:00,2000/05/08 09:00,['2000/04/14 09:00'],"['2000/04/14 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/05/08 09:00 [medline]', '2000/04/14 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2401711 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 2000 Apr;14(4):636-41. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2401711.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Expression of the IL-4 gene is tightly controlled at the level of gene transcription, and many positive regulatory cis-elements have been identified in the proximal IL-4 promoter region. Relatively little is known about factors that downregulate IL-4 transcription. We performed a detailed deletional analysis of the proximal human IL-4 promoter and studied reporter gene activity in transiently transfected Jurkat T lymphoblasts. In this report, we characterize a novel negative regulatory element (termed P2 NRE) that is adjacent to a binding site for nuclear factor of activated T cells. Mutation of P2 NRE significantly enhanced the activity of a 175 base pair IL-4 promoter construct in transiently transfected Jurkat T lymphoblasts. Using nuclear extracts from Jurkat cells, we identify a candidate factor (termed Rep-1) that binds uniquely to the P2 NRE in DNA-binding assays. Rep-1 is not related to other factors previously shown to interact with the IL-4 promoter, and by UV cross-linking and SDS-PAGE analysis, we found that it migrates with a molecular mass of approximately 150 kDa. Characterizing the molecular mechanisms responsible for downregulating the IL-4 promoter should enhance our understanding of IL-4-gene dysregulation in disease states.","['Georas, S', 'Cumberland, J', 'Burke, T', 'Park, E', 'Ono, S', 'Casolaro, V']","['Georas S', 'Cumberland J', 'Burke T', 'Park E', 'Ono S', 'Casolaro V']","['Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Johns Hopkins University Asthma and Allergy Center, Baltimore, MD 21224, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Binding Sites', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', 'DNA, Neoplasm/genetics/metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/metabolism', '*Gene Expression Regulation', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Genes, Reporter', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-4/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Macromolecular Substances', 'Molecular Weight', 'NFATC Transcription Factors', 'Neoplasm Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics', '*Nuclear Proteins', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/*genetics', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Repressor Proteins/isolation & purification/*metabolism', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Sequence Deletion', 'Sequence Homology, Nucleic Acid', 'Transcription Factors/metabolism', 'Transcriptional Activation', 'Transfection']",2000/04/14 09:00,2000/05/08 09:00,['2000/04/14 09:00'],"['2000/04/14 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/05/08 09:00 [medline]', '2000/04/14 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2401712 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 2000 Apr;14(4):629-35. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2401712.,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Macromolecular Substances)', '0 (NFATC Transcription Factors)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '207137-56-2 (Interleukin-4)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Quiescence can be induced by the differentiation of myeloid cells, and this led us to investigate whether the modulation of drug-induced apoptosis associated with differentiation might be a model for quiescence-associated resistance generally. We have demonstrated that resistance to idarubicin-induced apoptosis increased with greater duration of incubation of HL60 and U937 cells with ATRA and 1,25(OH)2 D3 and that this protective effect correlated with the degree of G0/G1 accumulation. In addition, the cytoprotective effects held for other classes of cytotoxic drugs with different mechanisms of action to idarubicin. Prolonged exposure to idarubicin or vinblastine was associated with diminution of the protective effect and re-entry of cells into cycle. The full cytoprotective effect was restored by resupplementation with ATRA or 1,25(OH)2 D3 during exposure to idarubicin, with concomitant persistence of G0/G1 accumulation. Differentiating agents prevented the accumulation of leukaemic cells at the G2/M checkpoint in response to low concentrations of idarubicin. Understanding how differentiating agents modulate these cell-cycle checkpoints, and how quiescent cells evade apoptosis, may allow the development of therapeutic strategies to limit such apoptosis-inhibiting effects and maximise cell kill from chemotherapy.","['Ketley, N J', 'Allen, P D', 'Kelsey, S M', 'Newland, A C']","['Ketley NJ', 'Allen PD', 'Kelsey SM', 'Newland AC']","['Department of Haematology, St Bartholomews and the Royal London School of Medicine and Dentistry, UK.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Calcitriol/pharmacology', 'Cell Cycle/*drug effects', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*physiology', 'G1 Phase/drug effects', 'HL-60 Cells/drug effects/pathology', 'Humans', 'Idarubicin/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*pathology', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*drug effects/pathology', 'Resting Phase, Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Tretinoin/pharmacology', 'U937 Cells/drug effects/pathology', 'Vinblastine/*pharmacology']",2000/04/14 09:00,2000/05/08 09:00,['2000/04/14 09:00'],"['2000/04/14 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/05/08 09:00 [medline]', '2000/04/14 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2401715 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 2000 Apr;14(4):620-8. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2401715.,"['5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', '5V9KLZ54CY (Vinblastine)', 'FXC9231JVH (Calcitriol)', 'ZRP63D75JW (Idarubicin)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Amount of immunoreactive cleaved forms of caspase 3 recognized by specific antibody was completely dissociated with its enzymatic activity when the cells were stimulated with GM-CSF, but not with TNF.

Using specific kinase inhibitors, this study has investigated the contribution of the Ras/PI3-kinase regulated survival pathways to drug resistance and suppression of apoptosis in a cell line derived from AML (HL60). Inhibition of the Raf/MAP-kinase (ERK) pathway with a specific MAP-kinase inhibitor, apigenin did not sensitise HL60 cells to drug-induced apoptosis, indicating a lack of involvement in chemoresistance. In contrast, the PI3-kinase inhibitors, LY294002 and wortmannin, did induce a significant increase in apoptosis in combination with cytotoxic drugs. The contribution of downstream mediators of PI3-kinase, p70S6-kinase and PKB/Akt were then investigated. While inhibition of p70S6-kinase with rapamycin did not increase drug-induced apoptosis, PI3-kinase inhibition resulted in notable dephosphorylation of PKB, suggesting that the PI3-kinase/PKB survival pathway may play a major role in chemoresistance in AML. This pathway has been reported to mediate heterodimer interactions with the proapoptotic regulator, Bad. In contrast to previous studies, we found no evidence of Bad binding to anti-apoptotic Bcl-2, Bcl-XL or McI-1, or of alterations in Bax heterodimers.

Expression studies show that synaptojanin is strongly expressed in bone marrow and immature leukaemic cell lines, very weakly in peripheral blood leukocytes and absent in Raji, a mature B cell line. We found that the SH3 domains of EEN and Abi-1 interact with different proline-rich domains of synaptojanin while the EH domains of Eps15 interact with the NPF motifs of synaptojanin. In vitro competitive binding assays demonstrate that EEN displays stronger binding affinity than Abi-1 and may compete with it for synaptojanin. These findings suggest a potential link between MLL fusion-mediated leukaemogenesis and the inositol-signalling pathway.","['So, C W', 'So, C K', 'Cheung, N', 'Chew, S L', 'Sham, M H', 'Chan, L C']","['So CW', 'So CK', 'Cheung N', 'Chew SL', 'Sham MH', 'Chan LC']","['Department of Pathology, The University of Hong Kong, Queen Mary Hospital, Pokfulam, China.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['*Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing', 'Binding Sites', 'Binding, Competitive', 'Blood Cells/metabolism', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/*genetics', '*Cytoskeletal Proteins', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics', 'Dynamins', 'GTP Phosphohydrolases/*metabolism', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase', 'Homeodomain Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins', 'Leukemia/*etiology/genetics', 'Macromolecular Substances', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Multigene Family', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein', 'Nerve Tissue Proteins/*metabolism', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*genetics', 'Organ Specificity', 'Phosphoric Monoester Hydrolases/*metabolism', 'Protein Binding', 'Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', '*Proto-Oncogenes', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis/isolation & purification', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', '*Transcription Factors', 'Translocation, Genetic', 'Two-Hybrid System Techniques', 'src Homology Domains']",2000/04/14 09:00,2000/05/08 09:00,['2000/04/14 09:00'],"['2000/04/14 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/05/08 09:00 [medline]', '2000/04/14 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2401692 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 2000 Apr;14(4):594-601. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2401692.,"['0 (ABI1 protein, human)', '0 (Abi1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (Cytoskeletal Proteins)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (KMT2A protein, human)', '0 (Macromolecular Substances)', '0 (Nerve Tissue Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (SH3GL1 protein, human)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)', 'EC 3.1.3.- (synaptojanin)', 'EC 3.1.3.2 (Phosphoric Monoester Hydrolases)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (GTP Phosphohydrolases)', 'EC 3.6.5.5 (Dynamins)']",,,,,,,,,,"['GENBANK/AF036268', 'GENBANK/AF036269']",,,,,,,,,,

An unanswered question is whether p15INK4B gene methylation is restricted to undifferentiated blastic cells, or whether differentiated cells such as granulocytes or erythrocytes of MDS origin also harbor this epigenetic alteration. In this study, we analyzed the methylation status of the p15INK4B gene in MDS by the methylation-specific PCR (MSP) method, which is more sensitive than Southern blotting. The bone marrow mononuclear cells (BM-MNCs) of 23 MDS patients were analyzed, and six of them showed p15INK4B methylation. Progenitor assay with methylcellulose medium was also performed in all patients. In two of the six patients with p15INK4B-methylated BM-MNCs, erythroid and/or non-erythroid colonies formed were subjected to molecular analysis. Colonies with and without p15INK4B methylation were detected in both patients. Furthermore, X-chromosome inactivation (XCI) pattern of each colony was simultaneously determined by MSP-based human androgen receptor gene analysis (HUMARA-MSP), and all p15INK4B-methylated colonies showed the same XCI pattern, which was dominant among the colonies, while p15INK4B-unmethylated colonies showed both patterns of XCI, in each of the two patients. We then examined the methylation status of the p15INK4B gene of granulocyte (PB-PMN) fractions from 10 patients with available peripheral blood cells. In all four patients with p15INK4B-methylated BM-MNCs, their PB-PMNs showed p15INK4B methylation. These results suggest that p15INK4B methylation in hematopoietic cells in MDS patients is restricted to the MDS clone but not necessarily to blast cells.","['Aoki, E', 'Uchida, T', 'Ohashi, H', 'Nagai, H', 'Murase, T', 'Ichikawa, A', 'Yamao, K', 'Hotta, T', 'Kinoshita, T', 'Saito, H', 'Murate, T']","['Aoki E', 'Uchida T', 'Ohashi H', 'Nagai H', 'Murase T', 'Ichikawa A', 'Yamao K', 'Hotta T', 'Kinoshita T', 'Saito H', 'Murate T']","['The First Department of Internal Medicine, Nagoya University School of Medicine, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Blood Cells/*chemistry', 'Blotting, Southern', 'Bone Marrow Cells/*chemistry', 'Carrier Proteins/*genetics', '*Cell Cycle Proteins', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p15', '*Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p16', 'DNA/chemistry', '*DNA Methylation', 'DNA, Neoplasm/chemistry/genetics', 'Dosage Compensation, Genetic', 'Female', '*Genes, Tumor Suppressor', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/chemistry', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*genetics/pathology', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*chemistry', 'Receptors, Androgen/genetics', '*Tumor Suppressor Proteins']",2000/04/14 09:00,2000/05/08 09:00,['2000/04/14 09:00'],"['2000/04/14 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/05/08 09:00 [medline]', '2000/04/14 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2401719 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 2000 Apr;14(4):586-93. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2401719.,"['0 (CDKN2B protein, human)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p15)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p16)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Receptors, Androgen)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

TPMT activity exhibits genetic polymorphism, with about 1/300 inheriting TPMT deficiency as an autosomal recessive trait. If treated with standard doses of thiopurines, TPMTdeficient patients accumulate excessive thioguanine nucleotides in hematopoietic tissues, leading to severe hematological toxicity that can be fatal. However, TPMT-deficient patients can be successfully treated with a 10- to 15-fold lower dosage of these medications. The molecular basis for altered TPMT activity has been defined, with rapid and inexpensive assays available for the three signature mutations which account for the majority of mutant alleles. TPMT genotype correlates well with in vivo enzyme activity within erythrocytes and leukemic blast cells and is clearly associated with risk of toxicity. The impact of 6-mercaptopurine dose intensity is also being clarified as an important determinate of event-free survival in childhood leukemia. In addition, there are emerging data that TPMT genotype may influence the risk of secondary malignancies, including brain tumors and acute myelogenous leukemia. Ongoing studies aim to clarify the influence of TPMT on thiopurine efficacy, acute toxicity, and risk for delayed toxicity.

Genotypic markers of B cell histogenesis are represented by mutations of IgV and BCL-6 genes, which are somatically acquired at the time of B cell transit through the germinal center (GC). Phenotypic markers are represented by BCL-6 and CD138/syndecan-1 protein expression and allow the distinction between GC and post-GC B cells. On this basis, lymphomas may be histogenetically distinguished into: (1) lymphomas devoid of somatic IgV and BCL-6 hypermutation, which derive from pre-germinal center B cells; (2) lymphomas associated with somatic IgV and/or BCL-6 hypermutation and BCL-6 expression, which closely reflect germinal center B cells; and (3) lymphomas associated with somatic IgV and/or BCL-6 hypermutation, as well as CD138/syndecan-1 positivity, representing lymphomas of post-germinal center B cells. In the March issue of Leukemia, Tsuboi et al report on the expression pattern of MUM1 in normal lymphoid tissues and in lymphoma. Because expression of MUM1 protein appears to be strictly regulated during lymphoid differentiation, and because expression of the molecule is retained upon neoplastic transformation, MUM1 may be added to the panel of phenotypic markers of B cell lymphoma histogenesis. In particular, MUM1 may provide a marker for the identification of transition from BCL-6 positivity (GC B cells) to CD138 expression (immunoblasts and plasma cells). These studies are of potential clinical value, since in some B cell malignancies, histogenesis may influence prognosis.","['Gaidano, G', 'Carbone, A']","['Gaidano G', 'Carbone A']",,['eng'],"['Editorial', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Biomarkers, Tumor/*analysis/genetics', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/genetics', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*analysis/genetics', 'Genes, Immunoglobulin', 'Germinal Center/pathology', 'Humans', 'Interferon Regulatory Factors', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/classification/genetics/*pathology', 'Models, Biological', 'Mutation', 'Phenotype', 'Plasma Cells/pathology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-6', 'Transcription Factors/*analysis/genetics']",2000/04/14 09:00,2000/05/08 09:00,['2000/04/14 09:00'],"['2000/04/14 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/05/08 09:00 [medline]', '2000/04/14 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2401748 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 2000 Apr;14(4):563-6. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2401748.,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Interferon Regulatory Factors)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-6)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (interferon regulatory factor-4)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In addition to mitogenic ability, we demonstrate in this report that EGF protects a human esophageal carcinoma (CE) cell line, CE81T/VGH, from staurosporine-induced apoptosis. The anti-apoptotic signal of EGF is alleviated by a MEK inhibitor PD98059 or an ERK2 dominant negative mutant but not by a phosphatidylinositol-3'-kinase (PI-3K) inhibitor wortmannin. Furthermore, v-raf blocks apoptosis induced by staurosporine. This evidence implies that the survival signal of EGF is mediated via the Raf-MEK-ERK pathway but not the PI3-K pathway. The survival effect of EGF is coincident with the induction of mcl-1, an antiapoptotic gene in the bcl-2 family. PD98059 also suppresses the induction of Mcl-1 by EGF, implying that EGF may up-regulate Mcl-1 via the MAP kinase pathway. Overexpression of mcl-1 is sufficient to protect against apoptosis, while transfection of a mcl-1 antisense plasmid causes cell death. The expression of mcl-1 antisense plasmid also suppresses the anti-apoptotic effect of EGF.

PML nuclear bodies are found in nearly all cells yet their function remains unknown. Here, we demonstrate that PML and the eukaryotic initiation factor 4E (elF-4E) co-localize and co-immunopurify. eIF-4E is involved in nucleocytoplasmic transport of specific mRNAs including cyclin D1. eIF-4E overexpression leads to increased cyclin D1 protein levels; whereas, overexpression of PML leads to decreased cyclin D1 levels. Neither PML nor eIF-4E cause significant changes in cyclin D1 mRNA levels. The association with eIF-4E led us to investigate if PML could alter mRNA distribution as a possible post-transcriptional mechanism for suppressing cyclin D1 production. We show that overexpression of PML results in nuclear retention of cyclin D1 mRNA and that intact PML nuclear bodies are required. Addition of eIF-4E overcomes PML induced retention and alters the morphology of PML bodies suggesting a mechanism by which eIF-4E can modulate PML function. These results raise the possibility that PML nuclear bodies may participate in the regulation of nucleocytoplasmic transport of specific mRNAs.","['Lai, H K', 'Borden, K L']","['Lai HK', 'Borden KL']","['Department of Physiology & Biophysics, Mount Sinai School of Medicine, New York, NY 10029, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,IM,"['3T3 Cells', 'Animals', 'Biological Transport', 'Cell Line', 'Cyclin D1/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Cytoplasm/*chemistry', 'Eukaryotic Initiation Factor-4E', 'Fibroblasts', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Macromolecular Substances', 'Mice', 'Neoplasm Proteins/biosynthesis/chemistry/genetics/isolation & purification/*physiology', '*Nuclear Proteins', 'Organelles/chemistry/physiology', 'Peptide Initiation Factors/analysis/isolation & purification', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'RNA, Messenger/*metabolism', 'RNA, Neoplasm/*metabolism', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/physiology', 'Subcellular Fractions/chemistry', 'Transcription Factors/chemistry/isolation & purification/*physiology', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins']",2000/04/14 09:00,2000/05/08 09:00,['2000/04/14 09:00'],"['2000/04/14 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/05/08 09:00 [medline]', '2000/04/14 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.onc.1203473 [doi]'],ppublish,Oncogene. 2000 Mar 23;19(13):1623-34. doi: 10.1038/sj.onc.1203473.,"['0 (Eukaryotic Initiation Factor-4E)', '0 (Macromolecular Substances)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Peptide Initiation Factors)', '0 (Pml protein, mouse)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '136601-57-5 (Cyclin D1)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)']",,,,['R01 CA80728/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Cells were separated from peripheral blood of healthy cattle and colleagues infected with bovine leukaemia virus (BLV). BLV-infected animals comprised lymphocytotic and non-lymphocytotic cows. L-selectin was expressed on 90-98% of granulocytes in all tested animals. The percentage of PBMC expressing L-selectin was lower in cattle with persistent lymphocytosis than in non-lymphocytotic or BLV-free cattle, and inversely correlated with lymphocyte counts. The ratio of B lymphocytes stained for L-selectin was significantly decreased from 60.2 +/- 1.9% in BLV-free cattle to 43.8 +/- 3.6 and 22.5 +/- 5.7% in non-lymphocytotic and lymphocytotic cattle, respectively. B-lymphocytes stained for L-selectin exhibited about 50% reduction in L-selectin expression in BLV-infected cattle compared with BLV-free cattle, as judged by the mean fluorescence intensity (MFI). The percentage of L-selectin-positive PBMC not bearing surface immunoglobulin M (predominantly T lymphocytes) was comparable in BLV-free and BLV-infected cattle. However, L-selectin expression on T lymphocytes was reduced (about 50%) in BLV-infected cattle, as judged by the MFI. We suppose that BLV infection results in a decreased L-selectin expression on lymphocytes, and accordingly, it may contribute to deregulation of the host immune system.","['Dusinsky, R', 'Bardotti, M', 'Ponti, W']","['Dusinsky R', 'Bardotti M', 'Ponti W']","['Institute of Veterinary Microbiology and Immunology, University of Milan, Italy. dusinsky@ubgz.savba.sk']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,J Vet Med B Infect Dis Vet Public Health,"Journal of veterinary medicine.

The last 10 years have been devoted to the location of oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes altered as a consequence of those changes. New molecular methodology has helped speed this process, which has resulted in DNA sequencing of many of the genes involved, permitting molecular detection of abnormal clones. METHODS: This review examines the most common alteration-based subgroups of cytogenetics and molecular genetics in hematologic disorders with the exclusion of lymphoma. Prognosis has been updated to reflect improving treatment protocols. RESULTS: The versatility of cytogenetics for delineating genetic changes is difficult to match by molecular testing. Once a clonal anomaly is identified, molecular methodology can detect residual disease with far greater sensitivity than cytogenetics, but relies on translocation junction targets that exclude clones characterized by deletion or trisomy. CONCLUSIONS: Cytogenetic and molecular testing offers independent diagnostic and prognostic evaluation for most patients with hematologic malignancy.","['Papenhausen', 'Moscinski', 'Binnie']","['Papenhausen PR', 'Moscinski LC', 'Binnie CG']","['Center for Molecular Biology and Pathology, Triangle Park, NC 27709, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Cancer Control,Cancer control : journal of the Moffitt Cancer Center,9438457,,,2000/04/14 00:00,2000/04/14 00:01,['2000/04/14 00:00'],"['2000/04/14 00:00 [pubmed]', '2000/04/14 00:01 [medline]', '2000/04/14 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1177/107327489700400501 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Control. 1997 Oct;4(5):389-398. doi: 10.1177/107327489700400501.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Detection of angiostatin and its precursor proteins in urine from cancer patients has not been reported. Now, we report the development of an antibody-based analysis system that allows us to detect angiostatin and plasminogen/plasmin (Pgn/plasmin) in the urine of cancer patients. The detection system is a combination of a novel lysine-ELISA assay and Western immunoblot analysis using a specific antibody to human angiostatin and Pgn/plasmin. High levels of Pgn/plasmin were detected in the urine from various cancer patients, whereas healthy individuals showed relatively low levels of urine Pgn/plasmin. Of interest, angiostatin is detectable in urine samples of patients with various cancers, including acute lymphoblastic leukemia, suggesting that angiogenesis may play an important role in the development and progression of leukemia. Our data for the first time show that angiostatin and Pgn/plasmin are present at relatively high levels in the urine of human cancer patients. Detection of urine angiostatin in cancer patients helps us not only to understand the role of this angiogenesis inhibitor in cancer development and progression but also allows us to develop tools of cancer diagnosis and prognosis.

We undertook a study to characterize the identity of this protein and its possible role in the hyperproliferative phenotypes observed. Using immunoblot and immunoprecipitation techniques, this protein was characterized as the p85 regulatory subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase. Cell proliferation and p85 tyrosine phosphorylation was not affected by tyrphostin AG-490, an inhibitor of Jak kinases, wortmannin or LY294002, inhibitors of the activity of the catalytic phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase subunit. Herbimycin-A and PPI, inhibitors of src-like protein tyrosine kinases, and genistein, a general tyrosine kinase inhibitor, inhibited p85 tyrosine phosphorylation and induced cell death in the sublines. PD98059, an inhibitor of Mek, inhibited cell growth of the sublines, but not that of the parental cells. It was concluded that tyrosine phosphorylation of p85 is associated with highly proliferative tumoral phenotypes, at least in T cell leukemias, independent of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase activity of the catalytic subunit.","['Martinez-Lorenzo, M J', 'Anel, A', 'Monleon, I', 'Sierra, J J', 'Pineiro, A', 'Naval, J', 'Alava, M A']","['Martinez-Lorenzo MJ', 'Anel A', 'Monleon I', 'Sierra JJ', 'Pineiro A', 'Naval J', 'Alava MA']","['Departamento de Bioquimica y Biologia Molecular y Celular, Facultad de Ciencias, Universidad de Zaragoza, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Int J Biochem Cell Biol,The international journal of biochemistry & cell biology,9508482,IM,"['Cell Division/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Lymphocyte Specific Protein Tyrosine Kinase p56(lck)/metabolism', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/*metabolism', 'Phosphoinositide-3 Kinase Inhibitors', 'Phosphorylation', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-fyn', 'Tyrosine/*metabolism']",2000/04/13 09:00,2000/06/08 09:00,['2000/04/13 09:00'],"['2000/04/13 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/06/08 09:00 [medline]', '2000/04/13 09:00 [entrez]']","['S1357-2725(99)00142-9 [pii]', '10.1016/s1357-2725(99)00142-9 [doi]']",ppublish,Int J Biochem Cell Biol. 2000 Apr;32(4):435-45. doi: 10.1016/s1357-2725(99)00142-9.,"['0 (Phosphoinositide-3 Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '42HK56048U (Tyrosine)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (FYN protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Lymphocyte Specific Protein Tyrosine Kinase p56(lck))', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-fyn)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In order to understand the functional relationship between the anti- and pro-apoptotic regulatory proteins in the cells under oxidant stress, we have studied the level of expression of apoptosis regulatory proteins, bcl-2 and bax, in human leukemia HL-60 cells. The exposure of HL-60 cells to different concentrations of H2O2 for 6 h resulted in a typical apoptosis of the cells as characterized by flow cytometry, cell cycle analysis, and DNA fragmantation. There was a block in G1 to S transition and apoptotic cells were mainly derived from S and G2 cells. Kinetic study demonstrated that the levels of both bcl-2-mRNA and -protein expression were decreased with the progression of cellular apoptosis whereas the level of bax-mRNA was unchanged but the expressed bax-protein was not detectable. Cycloheximide, a nonspecific translation inhibitor, did not prevent the hydrogen peroxide-mediated apoptosis in HL-60 cells. These results suggest that the regulation of bcl-2, but not of bax are important factor in the oxidative stress-induced apoptosis in HL-60 cells.","['Lee, J E', 'Sohn, J', 'Lee, J H', 'Lee, K C', 'Son, C S', 'Tockgo, Y C']","['Lee JE', 'Sohn J', 'Lee JH', 'Lee KC', 'Son CS', 'Tockgo YC']","['Department of Pediatrics, Korea University, Seoul.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Exp Mol Med,Experimental & molecular medicine,9607880,IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cycloheximide/pharmacology', 'DNA Fragmentation', 'DNA, Neoplasm/drug effects/genetics/metabolism', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Hydrogen Peroxide/*pharmacology', 'Oxidants/*pharmacology', 'Protein Synthesis Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*genetics/metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/drug effects/genetics/metabolism', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein']",2000/04/13 09:00,2000/06/03 09:00,['2000/04/13 09:00'],"['2000/04/13 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/06/03 09:00 [medline]', '2000/04/13 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/emm.2000.8 [doi]'],ppublish,Exp Mol Med. 2000 Mar 31;32(1):42-6. doi: 10.1038/emm.2000.8.,"['0 (BAX protein, human)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Oxidants)', '0 (Protein Synthesis Inhibitors)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', '98600C0908 (Cycloheximide)', 'BBX060AN9V (Hydrogen Peroxide)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: We report on the cases of two HIV-infected men, one with AML and one with myeloid blast crisis after polycythaemia vera (PV). A comprehensive review of the available literature will be presented. RESULTS: Patient 1, a 57-year-old bisexual man known to be HIV seropositive for more than four years (CDC-category A1), presented with a pulmonary infiltrate. On admission WBC showed leukocytes 5.6 x 10(9)/l and the differential revealed 80% blasts. A diagnosis of AML FAB M0 was made. Pneumonia resolved under antibiotic treatment and the patient received induction chemotherapy. However, he once more developed multiple pulmonary infiltrates and died of respiratory failure despite broad spectrum antibiotic and antimycotic therapy. Autopsy revealed pulmonary aspergillosis. Patient 2 was a 63-year old HIV-positive hemophiliac (CDC A3) with a 10-year history of PV. On admission his white cell count showed leukocytes 256.6 x 10(9)/l with 82% blasts. Cytochemistry revealed myelomonocytic differentiation. The patient died of tumor lysis syndrome with renal and cardio-pulmonary failure two days later. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first report of an HIV-infected individual with AML M0. The literature describes the cases of 39 HIV+ patients with AML and only one further case with PV. The association of both, myeloproliferative disease and AML with HIV infection is coincidental. However, the proportion of FAB type M4/5 appears to be higher than in the general population. Despite a high risk of treatment associated mortality durable remissions can be achieved in a small proportion of HIV-infected patients with AML.","['Hentrich, M', 'Rockstroh, J', 'Sandner, R', 'Brack, N', 'Hartenstein, R']","['Hentrich M', 'Rockstroh J', 'Sandner R', 'Brack N', 'Hartenstein R']","['Department of Medicine IV, Munich-Harlaching City Hospital, Academic Teaching Hospital of the Ludwig-Maximilians University of Munich, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Ann Oncol,Annals of oncology : official journal of the European Society for Medical Oncology,9007735,IM,"['Anti-HIV Agents/administration & dosage', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/administration & dosage', 'Blast Crisis/*diagnosis/drug therapy/etiology', 'Disease Progression', 'Fatal Outcome', 'HIV Infections/complications/*diagnosis/drug therapy/virology', 'HIV Seropositivity', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/complications/*diagnosis/drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Polycythemia Vera/diagnosis/drug therapy/*pathology', 'Viral Load']",2000/04/13 09:00,2000/06/24 11:00,['2000/04/13 09:00'],"['2000/04/13 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/06/24 11:00 [medline]', '2000/04/13 09:00 [entrez]']","['10.1023/a:1008304401661 [doi]', 'S0923-7534(19)54904-3 [pii]']",ppublish,Ann Oncol. 2000 Feb;11(2):195-200. doi: 10.1023/a:1008304401661.,['0 (Anti-HIV Agents)'],39,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: During the induction treatment of the AIEOP ALL 95 study, 62 patients were treated with either Erwinase (n = 15), or E. coli medac (n = 47) L-ASE products, given either i.m. or i.v., at the standard dosage of 10,000 IU/m2, q 3 days x 8 (first exposure). RESULTS: Plasma and CSF L-ASN trough levels were undetectable in all cases, including those with L-ASE trough activity < 50 mU/ml. L-ASE trough activity during the administration of medac was however significantly higher when compared with that of Erwinase. CONCLUSIONS: L-ASN depletion after a first exposure to standard doses of Erwinase or medac is obtained in virtually all patients. No differences are seen between the I.M. or I.V. administration routes but the medac product is associated with a significantly higher enzyme activity in respect of Erwinase. L-ASN levels may be undetectable also in patients with L-ASE trough activity levels < 50 mU/ml, challenging the current opinion that an activity level of 100 mU/ml is needed to obtain L-ASN depletion.","['Rizzari, C', 'Zucchetti, M', 'Conter, V', 'Diomede, L', 'Bruno, A', 'Gavazzi, L', 'Paganini, M', 'Sparano, P', 'Lo Nigro, L', 'Arico, M', 'Milani, M', ""D'Incalci, M""]","['Rizzari C', 'Zucchetti M', 'Conter V', 'Diomede L', 'Bruno A', 'Gavazzi L', 'Paganini M', 'Sparano P', 'Lo Nigro L', 'Arico M', 'Milani M', ""D'Incalci M""]","['Department of Pediatrics, San Gerardo Hospital, Monza, Italy. masera@xquasar.it']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Ann Oncol,Annals of oncology : official journal of the European Society for Medical Oncology,9007735,IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*administration & dosage', 'Asparaginase/*administration & dosage/blood/cerebrospinal fluid', 'Asparagine/*drug effects/*metabolism', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Escherichia coli/enzymology', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Injections, Intramuscular', 'Injections, Intravenous', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/diagnosis/*drug therapy/*enzymology', 'Treatment Outcome']",2000/04/13 09:00,2000/06/24 11:00,['2000/04/13 09:00'],"['2000/04/13 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/06/24 11:00 [medline]', '2000/04/13 09:00 [entrez]']","['10.1023/a:1008368916800 [doi]', 'S0923-7534(19)54903-1 [pii]']",ppublish,Ann Oncol. 2000 Feb;11(2):189-93. doi: 10.1023/a:1008368916800.,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '7006-34-0 (Asparagine)', 'EC 3.5.1.1 (Asparaginase)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The low density lipoprotein (LDL) element of the terplex gene carrier is shown to be efficient in delivery to smooth muscle cells as well as inducing minimal toxicity to A7R5 cells in culture. The terplex system condensed plasmid DNA into polyplex sizes ranging from 100 to 400 nm. Terplex demonstrated higher transfection efficacy than Lipofectin. Lactose was conjugated through a poly(ethyl glycol) (PEG) spacer to poly(L-lysine) (PLL) to tailor a gene carrier capable of condensing plasmid DNA. This cationic polymer targeted Hep G2 cells preferentially in culture. The inclusion of a lactose targeting moiety greatly increased the efficacy of the gene carrier over PEG-PLL and Lipofectin. A biodegradable nanoparticle gene carrier, polysaccharide-graft-PLL and poly(D,L-lactic acid), was synthesized and characterized. The nanoparticle size was controllable by changing the copolymer concentration, where the particles could be as small as 60 nm. When polysaccharide was used in the copolymer, the nanoparticle became more DNA adsorbent. The JLI mAb was linked to PLL. This gene carrier targets the antigen confined to stage II immature cortical thymocytes for leukemia therapy. A 20,000 mw PLL backbone was sufficient for compaction of DNA. Folic acid linked to PLL through a PEG spacer is currently being studied for DNA condensation and delivery to membrane associated folate binding protein positive endothelial cancer cells.","['Benns, J M', 'Kim, S W']","['Benns JM', 'Kim SW']","['Department of Pharmaceutics and Pharmaceutical Chemistry, Center for Controlled Chemical Delivery, University of Utah, Salt Lake City 84112, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,J Drug Target,Journal of drug targeting,9312476,IM,"['*Endocytosis/drug effects/physiology', 'Gene Targeting/*methods', '*Genetic Vectors', 'Humans', 'Technology, Pharmaceutical', '*Transfection']",2000/04/13 09:00,2000/06/24 11:00,['2000/04/13 09:00'],"['2000/04/13 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/06/24 11:00 [medline]', '2000/04/13 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.3109/10611860009009205 [doi]'],ppublish,J Drug Target. 2000;8(1):1-12. doi: 10.3109/10611860009009205.,,52,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

CD3+ LGL leukemia is the most frequent form of LGL leukemia and is a distinct entity by FAB and REAL classifications. METHODS: The clinical course, biological features, and recent data on pathogenesis of CD3+ LGL leukemia are reviewed. The spectrum of differential diagnosis is described. RESULTS: T-LGL leukemia affects elderly people. Approximately 60% of patients are symptomatic; recurrent infections secondary to chronic neutropenia, anemia, and rheumatoid arthritis are the main clinical features. The most common phenotype is CD3+, CD8+, CD57+. Clonality is detected by clonal rearrangement of the T-cell receptor gene. Clinical and molecular remission can be obtained with oral low-dose methotrexate. Serologic findings show frequent reactivity to the BA21 epitope of HTLV-I env p21e, suggesting that a cellular or retroviral protein with homology to BA21 may be important in pathogenesis. Clonal expansion may be facilitated by IL-12 and IL-15 lymphokines. Constitutive expression of Fas ligand by leukemic LGLs support the hypothesis that leukemic cells arise from antigen-activated cytotoxic T cells. Leukemic LGLs express a multidrug-resistance phenotype that could partly explain the chemoresistance observed in aggressive cases. CONCLUSIONS: CD3+ LGL leukemia is a distinct lymphoproliferative T-cell disorder with specific clinicobiological aspects. The clinical spectrum of LGL proliferations is wide and immunophenotypic, and genotypic studies are needed to establish the diagnosis.","['Lamy', 'Loughran']","['Lamy T', 'Loughran TP']","['Division of Medical Oncology and Hematology, H.

Although T-PLL has been referred to under different designations, it is a distinct clinico-biological entity and should be distinguished from other T-cell disorders. METHODS: The literature on T-PLL is reviewed. Experience on the clinical and laboratory features, differential diagnosis, and therapy on a large series of T-PLL patients is presented. RESULTS: T-PLL affects adults and occurs more frequently in men. The principal disease characteristics are organomegaly, skin lesions, and a raised lymphocyte count. Immunological markers show a post-thymic T-cell phenotype (TdT- CD2+ CD5+ CD3n) with strong expression of CD7. A CD4+ CD8- phenotype is seen in two thirds of cases. CD4 and CD8 are coexpressed in 25%, and a CD4- CD8+ phenotype is rare. Cytogenetics show a recurrent abnormality inv(14)(q11;q32) that is always associated to other aberrations (particularly iso8q or trisomy 8). Differential diagnosis between T-PLL and other T-cell malignancies is based on a constellation of clinical and laboratory features. Generally, T-PLL patients are refractory to the therapy used in lymphoid disorders. Median survival is short but is improving with the use of 2'-deoxycoformycin and the humanized monoclonal antibody, anti-CDw52 (Campath-1H).

Myeloid leukemia cells were derived from regenerated hematopoietic cells damaged by sublethal doses of X radiation in C3H/He inbred mice. We previously found that within the genome of the myeloid leukemia cells, a retrotransposon, the intracisternal A-particle (IAP) element, is integrated. Levels of IAP RNA, the source of cDNA for the integration, were analyzed quantitatively in C3H mice. Higher levels of IAP transcripts were observed in normal cells, particularly in hematopoietic cells, from C3H/He mice, than in those from C57BL/6J and STS/A mice. In the C3H/He mice, an approximately twofold increase in IAP RNA was found in the regenerated spleen and bone marrow cells at 5 days and from 12 to 90 days after whole-body X irradiation. In addition, an increased level of IAP RNA was observed in all the myeloid leukemia cells derived from C3H/He mice. This suggests that the elevated levels of IAP RNA in the regenerated hematopoietic cells after irradiation contribute to the increase in retrotransposition of IAP found in myeloid leukemia cells from C3H/He mice.","['Ishihara, H', 'Tanaka, I', 'Furuse, M', 'Tsuneoka, K']","['Ishihara H', 'Tanaka I', 'Furuse M', 'Tsuneoka K']","['First Research Group, National Institute of Radiological Sciences, Anagawa 4-9-1, Inage-ku, Chiba-shi, Chiba 263-8555, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Radiat Res,Radiation research,0401245,IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Blotting, Northern', 'Bone Marrow Cells/metabolism/pathology/*radiation effects', 'Cell Division', 'DNA Primers', 'Gene Expression Regulation/*radiation effects', 'Genes, Intracisternal A-Particle/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*pathology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C3H', 'Mice, Inbred Strains', 'RNA/genetics/*radiation effects']",2000/04/13 09:00,2000/05/08 09:00,['2000/04/13 09:00'],"['2000/04/13 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/05/08 09:00 [medline]', '2000/04/13 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1667/0033-7587(2000)153[0392:ieoiap]2.0.co;2 [doi]'],ppublish,Radiat Res. 2000 Apr;153(4):392-7. doi: 10.1667/0033-7587(2000)153[0392:ieoiap]2.0.co;2.,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '63231-63-0 (RNA)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

For these reasons, long-term survival and causes of death were evaluated in a cohort of subjects treated for childhood cancer who reached the elective end of therapy in continuous remission and were registered until 1992 in the Italian Registry of off-therapy subjects (OTR). The vital status of OTR subjects was ascertained in 1996 by a postal survey through census bureaux; for deceased subjects, the cause of death was defined and compared with the expected rates in the general population. At follow-up, out of 6402 eligible and evaluable subjects, 890 were found to have died; the estimated overall survival at 20 years was 80.7% (95% CI 79.3-82.1). Most of the patients (84.6%) died due to recurrence of the primary cancer, usually within the first 5 years after the OT. The cumulative incidence of death due to recurrence of the primary tumor was greater among subjects treated for solid tumor than among those treated for leukemia/lymphoma (p = 0.0001); in contrast, OT subjects after leukemia and lymphoma were more likely to die due to of medical complications of therapy (p < 0.02). Second cancers were the second most frequent cause of death, with a 12-fold risk compared with the general population; the figures were similar in the 2 cancer groups. Compared with the general population, OT subjects were 32 times more likely than same-age subjects to die. The SMR decreased to 6.1 when only non-cancer deaths were considered. Deaths due to external or avoidable causes occurred among survivors at a rate similar to that of the general population.","['Haupt, R', 'Valsecchi, M G', 'Silvestri, D', 'De Lorenzo, P', 'Napoli, S', 'Masera, G', 'Terracini, B', 'Jankovic, M']","['Haupt R', 'Valsecchi MG', 'Silvestri D', 'De Lorenzo P', 'Napoli S', 'Masera G', 'Terracini B', 'Jankovic M']","[""Scientific Directorate, G.

This observation prompted the authors to examine more cases of AML with t(16;21)(p11;q22) for this morphology. METHODS: The authors reviewed bone marrow smears for the presence of hemophagocytosis in 7 patients with AML identified as having t(16;21)(p11;q22). RESULTS: The leukemias belonged to the FAB-M1/M7 (n = 5), M5b (n = 2), and contained phagocytic blasts in various percentages (< 0.2-36.7%). The blasts contained either single or multiple cytoplasmic vacuoles, in some of which the phagosomes were visible. The engulfed hemopoietic cells (red cells, erythroblasts, lymphocytes, and thrombocytes) were also noted in their cytoplasm. These observations confirmed that hemophagocytosis by leukemic blasts is a common and characteristic feature of this type of leukemia. CONCLUSIONS: The study of 12 cases (the 7 cases described here and the previous 5 cases) strongly supports the hypothesis that hemophagocytosis by leukemic blasts is common and characteristic in this type of leukemia, which may be related to the specific chromosome aberration of t(16;21)(p11;q22).","['Imashuku, S', 'Hibi, S', 'Sako, M', 'Lin, Y W', 'Ikuta, K', 'Nakata, Y', 'Mori, T', 'Iizuka, S', 'Horibe, K', 'Tsunematsu, Y']","['Imashuku S', 'Hibi S', 'Sako M', 'Lin YW', 'Ikuta K', 'Nakata Y', 'Mori T', 'Iizuka S', 'Horibe K', 'Tsunematsu Y']","[""Division of Pediatrics, Children's Research Hospital, Kyoto Prefectural University of Medicine, Kyoto, Japan.""]",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Blast Crisis/*pathology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 16/*genetics', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 21/*genetics', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/blood/*genetics/pathology', 'Male', '*Phagocytosis', '*Translocation, Genetic']",2000/04/13 09:00,2000/05/16 09:00,['2000/04/13 09:00'],"['2000/04/13 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/05/16 09:00 [medline]', '2000/04/13 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/(SICI)1097-0142(20000415)88:8<1970::AID-CNCR28>3.0.CO;2-9 [pii]'],ppublish,Cancer. 2000 Apr 15;88(8):1970-5.,,,,['Copyright 2000 American Cancer Society.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: The frequency of septic deaths among 38 children who received multiagent remission induction therapy, including dexamethasone (6 mg/m(2)) daily for 28 days (pilot protocol 91-01P), was compared with the frequency of septic deaths among children previously treated (protocol 87-01) and subsequently treated (protocol 91-01) in consecutive Dana-Farber Cancer Institute (DFCI) ALL trials with induction therapy that included 21 and 28 days of prednisone (40 mg/m(2)), respectively. Except for dexamethasone in protocol 91-01P, the remission induction agents used were identical in substance to those used in protocol 87-01. Protocol 91-01, the successor 91-01P, was also similar, with the exception of the deletion of a single dose of L-asparaginase. RESULTS: Sixteen of the 38 children (42%) treated on the DFCI 91-01P had documented gram positive or gram negative sepsis (17 episodes) during remission induction, including 4 toxic deaths (11%). In contrast, there were 4 induction deaths among 369 children (1%) treated on protocol 87-01 (P = 0.0035) and 1 induction death among 377 children (<1%) treated on protocol 91-01 (P = 0.0003). CONCLUSIONS: Substitution of dexamethasone for prednisone or methylprednisolone in an otherwise intensive conventional induction regimen for previously untreated children with ALL resulted in an alarmingly high incidence of septic episodes and toxic deaths. Awareness of this complication, considering that the substitution has no apparent benefit in the efficacy of remission induction, argues against its routine use in intensive induction regimens for children with ALL.","['Hurwitz, C A', 'Silverman, L B', 'Schorin, M A', 'Clavell, L A', 'Dalton, V K', 'Glick, K M', 'Gelber, R D', 'Sallan, S E']","['Hurwitz CA', 'Silverman LB', 'Schorin MA', 'Clavell LA', 'Dalton VK', 'Glick KM', 'Gelber RD', 'Sallan SE']","[""Maine Children's Cancer Program, The Barbara Bush Children's Hospital at Maine Medical Center, Scarborough, ME 04074-9308, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents, Hormonal/administration & dosage/*adverse effects', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Dexamethasone/administration & dosage/*adverse effects', 'Fatal Outcome', 'Female', 'Gram-Negative Bacterial Infections/chemically induced/mortality', 'Gram-Positive Bacterial Infections/chemically induced/mortality', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Methylprednisolone/*administration & dosage', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy', 'Prednisone/*administration & dosage', 'Sepsis/*chemically induced/mortality']",2000/04/13 09:00,2000/05/16 09:00,['2000/04/13 09:00'],"['2000/04/13 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/05/16 09:00 [medline]', '2000/04/13 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/(SICI)1097-0142(20000415)88:8<1964::AID-CNCR27>3.0.CO;2-1 [pii]'],ppublish,Cancer. 2000 Apr 15;88(8):1964-9.,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Hormonal)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)', 'VB0R961HZT (Prednisone)', 'X4W7ZR7023 (Methylprednisolone)']",,,['Copyright 2000 American Cancer Society.'],['CA68484/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: The presence of an abnormal 12p was identified among 1880 children with newly diagnosed ALL; outcome was assessed by standard life table methods. RESULTS: A total of 174 cases (9%) had cytogenetically detectable 12p abnormalities; the majority of cases had a balanced translocation, a del(12p), or an add(12p). In the overall cohort, event free survival (EFS) at 6 years was similar for patients with or without a 12p abnormality (76%, SD = 6%, vs. 75%, SD = 2%, respectively; P = 0.60). Among patients with pseudodiploidy, an abnormal 12p conferred improved outcome (P = 0.008; relative risk = 0.51; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.31-0.85). There was a trend for improved EFS for those with abnormalities in both chromosome 12 homologues (P = 0.16; relative risk = 0.39; 95% CI, 0.10-1.55) and those with low hyperdiploidy (P = 0.07; relative risk = 0.44; 95% CI, 0.18-1.09). Among T-lineage ALL patients, there was a trend for worse outcome for abnormal versus normal 12p (P = 0.14; relative risk = 1.97; 95% CI, 0.78-4.93). There was no difference in EFS for the 12 patients with a dic(9;12) compared with patients lacking an abnormal 12p. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that although a cytogenetically detectable 12p aberration is a favorable risk factor for children with ALL and pseudodiploidy, it is not prognostic for the overall group of pediatric ALL patients treated with contemporary therapies of the CCG.","['Heerema, N A', 'Sather, H N', 'Sensel, M G', 'Lee, M K', 'Hutchinson, R', 'Nachman, J B', 'Lange, B J', 'Steinherz, P G', 'Bostrom, B', 'Gaynon, P S', 'Uckun, F M']","['Heerema NA', 'Sather HN', 'Sensel MG', 'Lee MK', 'Hutchinson R', 'Nachman JB', 'Lange BJ', 'Steinherz PG', 'Bostrom B', 'Gaynon PS', 'Uckun FM']","['Department of Genetics, Hughes Institute, St. Paul, MN, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', '*Chromosome Aberrations', '*Chromosome Disorders', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 12/*genetics', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/*genetics/pathology', 'Prognosis', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Assessment']",2000/04/13 09:00,2000/05/16 09:00,['2000/04/13 09:00'],"['2000/04/13 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/05/16 09:00 [medline]', '2000/04/13 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/(SICI)1097-0142(20000415)88:8<1945::AID-CNCR25>3.0.CO;2-6 [pii]'],ppublish,Cancer. 2000 Apr 15;88(8):1945-54.,,,,['Copyright 2000 American Cancer Society.'],"['CA-13539/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-60437/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Between January 1990 and July 1999 174 children with acute myeloid leukemia were admitted to the study institution. Translocation (8;21) was identified in 20 patients (11.5%). Eighteen patients were evaluable for the current study and 8 presented with GS at the time of diagnosis (GS+). RESULTS: The authors defined two groups of patients: those who were GS+ and those who were GS-. One patient in the GS+ group and two patients in the GS- group died during the induction phase of the study. Complete remission was achieved in seven patients in the GS+ group and eight patients in the GS- group. Two patients developed a recurrence in the GS+ group as did one patient in the GS- group. The event free-survival probability (the standard error) was 58% (18%) in the GS+ group and 70% (14%) in the GS- group. Localization of GS was in only one site in seven patients and at multiple sites in one patient. Patients with an epidural mass received local radiotherapy (one patient) or surgery (two patients). Two of these patients developed paraplegia as sequelae: one patient after surgery and one patient after radiotherapy. One patient with orbital GS received local radiotherapy because of progressive proptosis. The remaining four patients had a complete resolution of the GS with chemotherapy only. CONCLUSIONS: In the current study of patients with t(8;21)(q22;q22), the presence of granulocytic sarcoma was not found to be an adverse prognostic factor. However, careful attention should be paid, especially to patients with an epidural site, to avoid sequelae.

This double-blind, randomized study was designed to evaluate the hypothesis that polyunsaturated n-3 fatty acids can improve metabolic parameters, decrease chemical indices of inflammation, enhance quality of life, and extend disease free interval and survival time for dogs treated for lymphoblastic lymphoma with doxorubicin chemotherapy. METHODS: Thirty-two dogs with lymphoma were randomized to receive one of two diets supplemented with menhaden fish oil and arginine (experimental diet) or an otherwise identical diet supplemented with soybean oil (control diet). Diets were fed before and after remission was attained with up to five dosages of doxorubicin. Parameters examined included blood concentrations of glucose, lactic acid, and insulin in response to glucose and diet tolerance tests; alpha-1 acid glycoprotein; tumor necrosis factor; interleukin-6; body weight; amino acid profiles; resting energy expenditure; disease free interval (DFI); survival time (ST); and clinical performance scores. RESULTS: Dogs fed the experimental diet had significantly (P < 0.05) higher mean serum levels of the n-3 fatty acids docosahexaenoic acid (C22:6) and eicosapentaenoic acid (C20:5) compared with controls. Higher serum levels of C22:6 and C20:5 were associated with lesser (P < 0.05) plasma lactic acid responses to intravenous glucose and diet tolerance testing. Increasing C22:6 levels were significantly (P < 0.05) associated with longer DFI and ST for dogs with Stage III lymphoma fed the experimental diet. CONCLUSIONS: Fatty acids of the n-3 series normalize elevated blood lactic acid in a dose-dependent manner, resulting in an increase in DFI and ST for dogs with lymphoma.","['Ogilvie, G K', 'Fettman, M J', 'Mallinckrodt, C H', 'Walton, J A', 'Hansen, R A', 'Davenport, D J', 'Gross, K L', 'Richardson, K L', 'Rogers, Q', 'Hand, M S']","['Ogilvie GK', 'Fettman MJ', 'Mallinckrodt CH', 'Walton JA', 'Hansen RA', 'Davenport DJ', 'Gross KL', 'Richardson KL', 'Rogers Q', 'Hand MS']","['Comparative Oncology Unit, Departments of Clinical Sciences, College of Veterinary Medicine and Biomedical Sciences, Colorado State University, Fort Collins, CO 80523, USA.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Arginine/*therapeutic use', 'Cachexia/*prevention & control', 'Diet', 'Dietary Supplements', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Docosahexaenoic Acids/administration & dosage', 'Dogs', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Double-Blind Method', 'Doxorubicin/*therapeutic use', 'Eicosapentaenoic Acid/administration & dosage', 'Fatty Acids/*pharmacology', 'Fish Oils/*pharmacology', 'Lactic Acid/blood', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/metabolism/*veterinary', 'Survival Analysis']",2000/04/13 09:00,2000/05/16 09:00,['2000/04/13 09:00'],"['2000/04/13 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/05/16 09:00 [medline]', '2000/04/13 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/(SICI)1097-0142(20000415)88:8<1916::AID-CNCR22>3.0.CO;2-F [pii]'],ppublish,Cancer. 2000 Apr 15;88(8):1916-28.,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Fatty Acids)', '0 (Fish Oils)', '25167-62-8 (Docosahexaenoic Acids)', '33X04XA5AT (Lactic Acid)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', '94ZLA3W45F (Arginine)', 'AAN7QOV9EA (Eicosapentaenoic Acid)']",,,['Copyright 2000 American Cancer Society.'],['2 CA 29582/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To examine changes in the lipid composition induced by Mas-7, we carried out systemic lipid analysis of L1210 cells after Mas-7 treatment. The total lipid was determined by HPLC, gas-liquid chromatography, and electrospray ionization mass spectrometry in conjunction with differential radiolabelling with [(32)P]orthophosphate, [(3)H]myristic acid, and [(3)H]arachidonic acid. The lipid analysis revealed multiple changes in more than 10 lipid classes. Free fatty acids (FFAs) and phosphatidylethanol (PEt), the phospholipase D product in the presence of ethanol, were increased significantly and phosphatidylcholine (PC) was decreased. Digitonin, a membrane permeabilizing reagent, similarly affected the lipid composition of L1210. The FFA released showed a very broad distribution of saturated, monounsaturated, and polyunsaturated fatty acids, implying that phospholipase A(2) alone could not account for all of the FFAs released. By comparing the molecular species of PEt with those of endogenous PC, we showed that phospholipase D in L1210 cells appeared to act selectively on diacyl-PC. The perturbation-induced alterations in the lipid composition brought about by Mas-7 might play a crucial role in the physiology of the affected cells.","['Park, H S', 'Lee, S Y', 'Kim, Y H', 'Kim, J Y', 'Lee, S J', 'Choi, M']","['Park HS', 'Lee SY', 'Kim YH', 'Kim JY', 'Lee SJ', 'Choi M']","['Department of Chemistry and Center for Molecular Catalysis, Seoul National University, Seoul, South Korea.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Biochim Biophys Acta,Biochimica et biophysica acta,0217513,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Membrane/*drug effects', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Digitonin/pharmacology', 'Fatty Acids, Nonesterified/analysis', 'Glycerophospholipids/analysis', 'Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins', 'Leukemia L1210', 'Mass Spectrometry', 'Membrane Lipids/*chemistry', 'Peptides/*pharmacology', 'Phosphatidylcholines/analysis', 'Phospholipids/*analysis', 'Phosphorus Radioisotopes', 'Tritium', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Wasp Venoms/pharmacology']",2000/04/13 09:00,2000/07/06 11:00,['2000/04/13 09:00'],"['2000/04/13 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/07/06 11:00 [medline]', '2000/04/13 09:00 [entrez]']","['S1388198100000020 [pii]', '10.1016/s1388-1981(00)00002-0 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochim Biophys Acta. 2000 Apr 12;1484(2-3):151-62. doi: 10.1016/s1388-1981(00)00002-0.,"['0 (Fatty Acids, Nonesterified)', '0 (Glycerophospholipids)', '0 (Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Mas7 protein, synthetic)', '0 (Membrane Lipids)', '0 (Peptides)', '0 (Phosphatidylcholines)', '0 (Phospholipids)', '0 (Phosphorus Radioisotopes)', '0 (Wasp Venoms)', '0 (phosphatidylethanol)', '10028-17-8 (Tritium)', '72093-21-1 (mastoparan)', 'KOO5CM684H (Digitonin)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Therefore it seems reasonable to speculate that neoplasms derived from this particular T-cell subset display distinct features. Indeed, the prototype gammadelta T-cell lymphoma, hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma constitutes a unique clinicopathological entitity which is intimately associated with a gammadelta T-cell phenotype. However, gammadelta T-cell lymphomas have also been described in other extranodal sites where, unlike reactive gammadelta T-cells and hepatosplenic gammadelta T-cell lymphomas, they display an important morphological heterogeneity. Moreover, these nonhepatosplenic gammadelta T-cell lymphomas are essentially not that different from their alphabeta T-cell receptor for antigen (TCR)-expressing counterparts and thus may be incorporated in the established T-cell lymphoma subclasses. However, subtle differences regarding their histopathological appearance as well as their biological behaviour indicate that further studies to determine the exact significance of TCR expression are required. Such inquiries may contribute to the general understanding of T-cell lymphomagenesis in general, which is still obscure.","['de Wolf-Peeters, C', 'Achten, R']","['de Wolf-Peeters C', 'Achten R']","['Department of Pathology, K.U.

The aim of this study was to examine the presence and nature of the enzyme responsible for final activation of the molecule, 1-alpha-hydroxylase, in murine macrophages and to analyse its regulation and possible role in the immune system. Peritoneal macrophages from C57Bl/6 mice were incubated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS; 100 microg/ml), interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma; 500 U/ml) or a combination of both. By quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction, using primers based on the murine renal cDNA sequence, low levels of 1-alpha-hydroxylase mRNA were detected in freshly isolated cells (18 +/- 7 x 10-6 copies/beta-actin copies). Analysis of the cDNA sequence of the gene revealed identical coding sequences for the macrophage and renal enzymes. mRNA levels rose three-fold with LPS (NS), but a six-fold increase was seen after IFN-gamma stimulation (P < 0.05). Combining LPS and IFN-gamma did not result in a major additional increase, but addition of cyclosporin A further increased levels 2.5-fold both in IFN-gamma- and combination-stimulated cells (P < 0.05). Time course analysis revealed that up-regulation of 1-alpha-hydroxylase was a late phenomenon, preceded by the up-regulation of activating macrophage products such as IL-1 and tumour necrosis factor-alpha. Finally, a defect in 1-alpha-hydroxylase up-regulation by immune stimuli was found in autoimmune non-obese diabetic mice. In conclusion, we propose that the up-regulation of 1-alpha-hydroxylase in activated macrophages, resulting in the synthesis of 1,25(OH)2D3, might be a negative feedback loop in inflammation. A defect in this system might be an additional element in tipping the balance towards autoimmunity.","['Overbergh, L', 'Decallonne, B', 'Valckx, D', 'Verstuyf, A', 'Depovere, J', 'Laureys, J', 'Rutgeerts, O', 'Saint-Arnaud, R', 'Bouillon, R', 'Mathieu, C']","['Overbergh L', 'Decallonne B', 'Valckx D', 'Verstuyf A', 'Depovere J', 'Laureys J', 'Rutgeerts O', 'Saint-Arnaud R', 'Bouillon R', 'Mathieu C']","['Laboratorium voor experimentele geneeskunde en endocrinologie (LEGENDO), Catholic University of Leuven, Belgium.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Clin Exp Immunol,Clinical and experimental immunology,0057202,IM,"['Animals', 'Autoimmune Diseases/enzymology/genetics', 'Cell Line', 'Cholestanetriol 26-Monooxygenase', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Cyclosporine/pharmacology', 'Cytokines/genetics', 'Female', 'Kidney/cytology/enzymology/immunology', 'Leukemia P388', 'Macrophage Activation/drug effects', 'Macrophages, Peritoneal/*enzymology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA', 'Steroid Hydroxylases/biosynthesis/genetics/*metabolism', 'Time Factors', 'Transcription, Genetic/immunology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Up-Regulation/drug effects/immunology']",2000/04/12 09:00,2000/05/16 09:00,['2000/04/12 09:00'],"['2000/04/12 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/05/16 09:00 [medline]', '2000/04/12 09:00 [entrez]']","['cei1204 [pii]', '10.1046/j.1365-2249.2000.01204.x [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Exp Immunol. 2000 Apr;120(1):139-46. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2249.2000.01204.x.,"['0 (Cytokines)', '83HN0GTJ6D (Cyclosporine)', 'EC 1.14.- (Steroid Hydroxylases)', 'EC 1.14.15.15 (Cholestanetriol 26-Monooxygenase)', 'EC 1.14.15.15 (Cyp27a1 protein, mouse)']",,PMC1905630,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A total of 101 leucaphereses from 29 patients was performed. The median cell numbers collected were: CD34+ cells, 2.2 x 106/kg (0.1-15.3); granulocyte-macrophage colony-forming units (GM-CFU), 4.29 x 104/kg (0.4-177); and mononuclear cells, 6.4 x 108/kg (1.3-63). In univariate and multivariate analyses, the numbers of cells collected were not significantly influenced by the nature of mobilizing regimen and there was a trend towards the collection of a higher number of CD34+ cells from patients who received fludarabine only before mobilization. There was a significant correlation between the median number of CD34+ cells collected and the number of courses of fludarabine (higher CD34+ cell numbers were related to more than six courses) and the interval between the last dose of fludarabine and the start of mobilizing therapy (higher CD34+ cell numbers were related to a delay > or = 2 months). Sixteen patients have subsequently undergone autologous transplantation and showed rapid engraftment. In conclusion, the results reported favour early stem cell mobilization in CLL patients who are in remission after first-line therapy. However, attention should be given to the timing of mobilization with respect to the time since the last dose of fludarabine.","['Michallet, M', 'Thiebaut, A', 'Dreger, P', 'Remes, K', 'Milpied, N', 'Santini, G', 'Hamon, M', 'Bjorkstrand, B', 'Kimby, E', 'Belhabri, A', 'Tanguy, M L', 'Apperley, J F']","['Michallet M', 'Thiebaut A', 'Dreger P', 'Remes K', 'Milpied N', 'Santini G', 'Hamon M', 'Bjorkstrand B', 'Kimby E', 'Belhabri A', 'Tanguy ML', 'Apperley JF']","[""Service d'Hematologie, Hopital Edouard Herriot, Lyon, France. mauricette.michallet@chu-lyon.fr""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Mobilization/*methods', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*methods', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/drug therapy/*therapy', 'Time Factors', 'Transplantation Conditioning/methods', 'Transplantation, Autologous', 'Vidarabine/*analogs & derivatives/therapeutic use']",2000/04/12 09:00,2000/06/10 09:00,['2000/04/12 09:00'],"['2000/04/12 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/06/10 09:00 [medline]', '2000/04/12 09:00 [entrez]']","['bjh1900 [pii]', '10.1046/j.1365-2141.2000.01900.x [doi]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2000 Mar;108(3):595-601. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2141.2000.01900.x.,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'P2K93U8740 (fludarabine)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Cell death after 24 h exposure to 10 micromol/l etoposide was about 60% and 70% in the ES subclone and about 20% and 25% in the ER subclone, when analysed by trypan blue and annexin V respectively. Cytochrome c efflux from mitochondria to cytosol was observed after 4 h of exposure in both subclones, whereas the activation of caspase-3 was not detectable until after 12 h of exposure in the ES subclone and 24 h of exposure in the ER subclone, using Western blotting. The decrease in mitochondrial membrane potential, when analysed by the JC-1 probe fluorocytometrically, also appeared to take place later in the ER than in the ES subclone. Both subclones showed evident basal expression of MnSOD and bcl-2 by Western blotting. Etoposide caused a potent induction of MnSOD, more than 400% at 12 h, in the ER but not in the ES subclone. No significant change in bcl-2 expression could be observed in either of the subclones during exposure to etoposide when analysed by Western blotting or flow cytometry. In conclusion, we suggest that MnSOD might have a special role in the protection of AML cells against etoposide-induced cell death. Although unable to influence the cytochrome c efflux to cytosol, MnSOD might prevent the disruption of mitochondrial membrane potential, which evidently leads to cell death by releasing various activators of apoptosis.","['Mantymaa, P', 'Siitonen, T', 'Guttorm, T', 'Saily, M', 'Kinnula, V', 'Savolainen, E R', 'Koistinen, P']","['Mantymaa P', 'Siitonen T', 'Guttorm T', 'Saily M', 'Kinnula V', 'Savolainen ER', 'Koistinen P']","['Department of Clinical Chemistry, University of Oulu, Finland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/*therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Blotting, Western', 'Caspase 3', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Cytochrome c Group/metabolism', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Enzyme Induction/drug effects', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/therapeutic use', 'Etoposide/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/*enzymology/metabolism', 'Membrane Potentials/drug effects', 'Mitochondria/*enzymology/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'Superoxide Dismutase/*biosynthesis/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2000/04/12 09:00,2000/06/10 09:00,['2000/04/12 09:00'],"['2000/04/12 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/06/10 09:00 [medline]', '2000/04/12 09:00 [entrez]']","['bjh1852 [pii]', '10.1046/j.1365-2141.2000.01852.x [doi]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2000 Mar;108(3):574-81. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2141.2000.01852.x.,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Cytochrome c Group)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', 'EC 1.15.1.1 (Superoxide Dismutase)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It may also regulate the multidrug resistance (MDR) phenotype in leukaemic cells. These data showed that MDR1+ K/Dau600 cells exhibited a higher basal level of PKA activity than MDR- parental cells. The significance of this on tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha)-induced apoptosis and cytostasis was investigated further. In comparison with MDR1- parental cells, K/Dau600 cells had a higher expression of PKA regulatory subunit RIalpha and nuclear catalytic subunit PKAcalpha. They were also more susceptible to inhibition of proliferation and induction of apoptosis by TNFalpha and/or forskolin, but this could be attenuated by H89. An increase in cAMP was associated with the apoptosis in the K/Dau600 cell line. Forskolin inactivated NF-kappaB in K/Dau600 cells but not in K562 cl. 6 cells, whereas TNF activated NF-kappaB in K562 cl.6 cells but not in K/Dau600 cells. 8-Cl-cAMP exhibited similar inhibitory effects on the proliferation of all of the cell lines used via its metabolite 8-Cl-adenosine, which indicates that these effects were independent of residual PKA or cAMP.

We have reviewed our hospital's experience with Fusarium between 1985 and 1995. Fusarium species were isolated from 22 specimens, representing 11 patients. Cases were not clustered by time period. The median age of the patients was 36.5 years (range 17-69 years). The sources of the organism were 12 skin lesions from eight patients, seven blood cultures from two patients and one specimen each from a Hickman catheter tip, nail clippings and a bronchoalveolar lavage. Seven of the patients had chemotherapy-induced neutropenia when the Fusarium was isolated. Five of them developed invasive fusarosis during acute leukaemia induction treatment. They remained neutropenic, and none survived. The other two patients recovered from neutropenia and were treated successfully for this infection. The remaining four patients were not neutropenic or immunocompromised. Three grew Fusarium from skin or nail clippings and one from bronchial alveolar lavage (BAL). There was no evidence of invasive disease in any of the four. None of them received antifungal therapy, and they were all alive at last follow-up. We conclude that Fusarium is a newly emerging infection in neutropenic patients. A high index of suspicion, especially for skin lesions, will help in early diagnosis before systemic and visceral dissemination. Excision of the initial focus of infection and antifungal therapy, aided by speedy neutrophil recovery, are likely to protect patients threatened with these fatal infections. Fusarium isolated from non-neutropenic, non-immunosuppressed patients is not significant and does not merit systemic antifungal treatment.","['Musa, M O', 'Al Eisa, A', 'Halim, M', 'Sahovic, E', 'Gyger, M', 'Chaudhri, N', 'Al Mohareb, F', 'Seth, P', 'Aslam, M', 'Aljurf, M']","['Musa MO', 'Al Eisa A', 'Halim M', 'Sahovic E', 'Gyger M', 'Chaudhri N', 'Al Mohareb F', 'Seth P', 'Aslam M', 'Aljurf M']","['Section of Adult Haematology/BMT, King Faisal Specialist Hospital and Research Centre, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Amphotericin B/therapeutic use', 'Antifungal Agents/therapeutic use', 'Dermatomycoses/drug therapy/*immunology/pathology', 'Female', 'Foot Dermatoses/drug therapy/*immunology/pathology', 'Fusarium/*isolation & purification', 'Humans', '*Immunocompromised Host', 'Leukemia/immunology/microbiology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Necrosis', 'Neutropenia/immunology/microbiology', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Skin/microbiology/pathology']",2000/04/12 09:00,2000/06/10 09:00,['2000/04/12 09:00'],"['2000/04/12 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/06/10 09:00 [medline]', '2000/04/12 09:00 [entrez]']","['bjh1856 [pii]', '10.1046/j.1365-2141.2000.01856.x [doi]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2000 Mar;108(3):544-8. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2141.2000.01856.x.,"['0 (Antifungal Agents)', '7XU7A7DROE (Amphotericin B)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Second remission was achieved in over 95% of patients. Two patients died during induction and seven patients died of resistant disease. The overall actuarial event-free survival (EFS) at 5 years for all patients experiencing a first relapse was 46% (95% CI 40-52). Duration of first remission, site of relapse, age at diagnosis and sex emerged as factors of prognostic significance. Five-year EFS was only 7% for children relapsing in the bone marrow within 2 years of diagnosis, but was 77% for those relapsing without bone marrow involvement > 2.5 years from diagnosis. All analyses in this report are by treatment received. For those receiving chemotherapy alone, the 5-year EFS was 48%; for autologous bone marrow transplantation (BMT), the 5-year EFS was 47%; for unrelated donor BMT, it was 52%; and for related donor BMT, the 5-year EFS was 45%. The groups, however, were not comparable with respect to risk factor profile, and therefore direct comparison of EFS is misleading. Adjustment for time to transplant and prognostic factors was used to reduce the effects of biases between treatment groups, but did not suggest benefit for any particular treatment. There was failure of our planned randomization scheme in this trial with only 9% of those eligible being randomized, which highlights the difficulties in running randomized trials especially in patients who have relapsed from a previous trial. The optimal treatment for relapsed ALL therefore remains uncertain. Alternative approaches are clearly needed for those with early bone marrow relapse if outcome is to improve.","['Lawson, S E', 'Harrison, G', 'Richards, S', 'Oakhill, A', 'Stevens, R', 'Eden, O B', 'Darbyshire, P J']","['Lawson SE', 'Harrison G', 'Richards S', 'Oakhill A', 'Stevens R', 'Eden OB', 'Darbyshire PJ']","[""Department of Haematology, Birmingham Children's Hospital, Birmingham, UK. isaac.lawson@btinternet.com""]",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Controlled Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article']",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Asparaginase/administration & dosage', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/methods', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Cyclophosphamide/therapeutic use', 'Cytarabine/therapeutic use', 'Dexamethasone/administration & dosage', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Epirubicin/administration & dosage', 'Humans', 'Hydrocortisone/therapeutic use', 'Infant', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/mortality/surgery', 'Prognosis', 'Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic', 'Recurrence', 'Statistics, Nonparametric', 'Thioguanine/administration & dosage', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Treatment Outcome', 'United Kingdom', 'Vincristine/administration & dosage']",2000/04/12 00:00,2000/06/10 00:00,['2000/04/12 00:00'],"['2000/04/12 00:00 [pubmed]', '2000/06/10 00:00 [medline]', '2000/04/12 00:00 [entrez]']","['bjh1891 [pii]', '10.1046/j.1365-2141.2000.01891.x [doi]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2000 Mar;108(3):531-43. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2141.2000.01891.x.,"['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '3Z8479ZZ5X (Epirubicin)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'EC 3.5.1.1 (Asparaginase)', 'FTK8U1GZNX (Thioguanine)', 'WI4X0X7BPJ (Hydrocortisone)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Several processes are involved, such as disseminated intravascular coagulation and hyperfibrinolysis. Recently, TAFI (thrombin-activatable fibrinolysis inhibitor) was identified as a link between coagulation and fibrinolysis. TAFI can be activated by thrombin, and in its activated form potently attenuates fibrinolysis by removing C-terminal lysine and arginine residues that are important for the binding and activation of plasminogen. Activation of TAFI by the coagulation system results in a down-regulation of fibrinolytic activity and, thereby, prevents a rapid dissolution of the fibrin clot. To establish whether TAFI was involved in the severity of the bleeding complications in APL, the TAFI antigen and activity levels were determined in a group of 15 patients. The TAFI antigen concentration was normal, but the activity of TAFI was severely reduced in APL by approximately 60%. The reduction of TAFI activity was most probably caused by the action of plasmin on TAFI because in vitro experiments revealed that plasmin slightly reduced antigen levels but severely reduced TAFI activity. The acquired functional TAFI deficiency in APL may contribute to the severity of the haemorrhagic diathesis because of the impaired capacity of the coagulation system to protect the fibrin clot from fibrinolysis.","['Meijers, J C', 'Oudijk, E J', 'Mosnier, L O', 'Bos, R', 'Bouma, B N', 'Nieuwenhuis, H K', 'Fijnheer, R']","['Meijers JC', 'Oudijk EJ', 'Mosnier LO', 'Bos R', 'Bouma BN', 'Nieuwenhuis HK', 'Fijnheer R']","['The Department of Haematology, University Medical Centre, Utrecht, The Netherlands. j.meijers@lab.azu.nl']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antigens/blood', 'Carboxypeptidase B2', 'Carboxypeptidases/*deficiency/immunology/metabolism', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Clinical Enzyme Tests', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Female', 'Fibrinolysin/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*enzymology/immunology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Thrombin/pharmacology']",2000/04/12 09:00,2000/06/10 09:00,['2000/04/12 09:00'],"['2000/04/12 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/06/10 09:00 [medline]', '2000/04/12 09:00 [entrez]']","['bjh1890 [pii]', '10.1046/j.1365-2141.2000.01890.x [doi]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2000 Mar;108(3):518-23. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2141.2000.01890.x.,"['0 (Antigens)', 'EC 3.4.- (Carboxypeptidases)', 'EC 3.4.17.20 (Carboxypeptidase B2)', 'EC 3.4.21.5 (Thrombin)', 'EC 3.4.21.7 (Fibrinolysin)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

BACKGROUND: Closure of a PFO has been proposed as an alternative to anticoagulation in patients with presumed paradoxical emboli. METHODS: Data were collected for patients following PFO closure with the Clamshell, CardioSEAL or Buttoned Devices at two institutions. RESULTS: There were 63 patients (46 +/- 18 years) with a follow-up of 2.6 +/- 2.4 years. Fifty-four (86%) had effective closure of the foramen ovale (trivial or no residual shunt by echocardiography) while seven (11%) had mild and two (3%) had moderate residual shunting. There were four deaths (leukemia, pulmonary embolism, sepsis following a hip fracture and lung cancer). There were four recurrent embolic neurological events following device placement: one stroke and three transient events. The stroke occurred in a 56-year-old patient six months following device placement. A follow-up transesophageal echocardiogram showed a well seated device without residual shunting. Two of the four events were associated with suboptimal device performance (one patient had a significant residual shunt and a second patient had a ""friction lesion"" in the left atrial wall associated with a displaced fractured device arm). The risk of recurrent stroke or transient neurological event following device placement was 3.2% per year for all patients. CONCLUSION: Transcatheter closure of PFO is an alternative therapy for paradoxical emboli in selected patients. Improved device performance may reduce the risk of recurrent neurological events. Further studies are needed to identify patients most likely to benefit from this intervention.","['Hung, J', 'Landzberg, M J', 'Jenkins, K J', 'King, M E', 'Lock, J E', 'Palacios, I F', 'Lang, P']","['Hung J', 'Landzberg MJ', 'Jenkins KJ', 'King ME', 'Lock JE', 'Palacios IF', 'Lang P']","['Cardiac Unit, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Am Coll Cardiol,Journal of the American College of Cardiology,8301365,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Catheterization/*adverse effects/instrumentation/*methods', 'Echocardiography, Transesophageal', 'Embolism, Paradoxical/*etiology', 'Equipment Failure', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Heart Septal Defects, Atrial/*complications/diagnostic imaging/physiopathology/*therapy', 'Humans', 'Ischemic Attack, Transient/*etiology', 'Life Tables', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'Recurrence', 'Risk Factors', 'Stroke/*etiology', 'Survival Analysis', 'Treatment Outcome']",2000/04/12 09:00,2000/04/25 09:00,['2000/04/12 09:00'],"['2000/04/12 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/04/25 09:00 [medline]', '2000/04/12 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0735-1097(00)00514-3 [pii]', '10.1016/s0735-1097(00)00514-3 [doi]']",ppublish,J Am Coll Cardiol. 2000 Apr;35(5):1311-6. doi: 10.1016/s0735-1097(00)00514-3.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the search for possible agents inducing infant leukemia, we identified bioflavonoids, natural substances in food as well as in dietary supplements, that cause site-specific DNA cleavage in the MLL breakpoint cluster region (BCR) in vivo. The MLL BCR DNA cleavage was shown in primary progenitor hematopoietic cells from healthy newborns and adults as well as in cell lines; it colocalized with the MLL BCR cleavage site induced by chemotherapeutic agents, such as etoposide (VP16) and doxorubicin (Dox). Both in vivo and additional in vitro experiments demonstrated topoisomerase II (topo II) as the target of bioflavonoids similar to VP16 and Dox. Based on 20 bioflavonoids tested, we identified a common structure essential for topo II-induced DNA cleavage. Reversibility experiments demonstrated a religation of the bioflavonoid as well as the VP16-induced MLL cleavage site. Our observations support a two-stage model of cellular processing of topo II inhibitors: The first and reversible stage of topo II-induced DNA cleavage results in DNA repair, but also rarely in chromosome translocations; whereas the second, nonreversible stage leads to cell death because of an accumulation of DNA damage. These results suggest that maternal ingestion of bioflavonoids may induce MLL breaks and potentially translocations in utero leading to infant and early childhood leukemia.","['Strick, R', 'Strissel, P L', 'Borgers, S', 'Smith, S L', 'Rowley, J D']","['Strick R', 'Strissel PL', 'Borgers S', 'Smith SL', 'Rowley JD']","['University of Chicago, Department of Medicine, Section of Hematology/Oncology, Chicago, IL 60637, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,IM,"['Adult', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cells, Cultured', 'DNA Topoisomerases, Type II/metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/drug effects/*genetics', '*Diet', 'Exons', 'Fetal Blood/cytology', 'Flavonoids/*adverse effects/pharmacology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*cytology', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/epidemiology/*genetics', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/epidemiology/*genetics', '*Proto-Oncogenes', '*Transcription Factors', '*Translocation, Genetic']",2000/04/12 09:00,2000/06/08 09:00,['2000/04/12 09:00'],"['2000/04/12 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/06/08 09:00 [medline]', '2000/04/12 09:00 [entrez]']","['10.1073/pnas.070061297 [doi]', '070061297 [pii]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2000 Apr 25;97(9):4790-5. doi: 10.1073/pnas.070061297.,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Flavonoids)', '0 (KMT2A protein, human)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)', 'EC 5.99.1.3 (DNA Topoisomerases, Type II)']",,PMC18311,,"['P01 CA040046/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-40046/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-42557/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",['Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2000 Apr 25;97(9):4411-3.

In marrow reconstitution experiments, coexpression of both genes produces rapid AML, while neither gene alone generates overt leukemia. Although Hoxa9 and Meis1 can bind DNA as heterodimers, both can also heterodimerize with Pbx proteins. Thus, while their coactivation may result from the necessity to bind promoters as heterodimers, it may also result from the necessity of altering independent biochemical pathways that cooperate to generate AML, either as monomers or as heterodimers with Pbx proteins. Here we demonstrate that constitutive expression of Hoxa9 in primary murine marrow immortalizes a late myelomonocytic progenitor, preventing it from executing terminal differentiation to granulocytes or monocytes in the presence of granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) or interleukin-3. This immortalized phenotype is achieved in the absence of endogenous or exogenous Meis gene expression. The Hoxa9-immortalized progenitor exhibited a promyelocytic transcriptional profile, expressing PU.1, AML1, c-Myb, C/EBP alpha, and C/EBP epsilon as well as their target genes, the receptors for GM-CSF, G-CSF, and M-CSF and the primary granule proteins myeloperoxidase and neutrophil elastase. G-CSF obviated the differentiation block of Hoxa9, inducing neutrophilic differentiation with accompanying expression of neutrophil gelatinase B and upregulation of gp91phox. M-CSF also obviated the differentiation block, inducing monocytic differentiation with accompanying expression of the macrophage acetyl-low-density lipoprotein scavenger receptor and F4/80 antigen. Versions of Hoxa9 lacking the ANWL Pbx interaction motif (PIM) also immortalized a promyelocytic progenitor with intrinsic biphenotypic differentiation potential. Therefore, Hoxa9 evokes a cytokine-selective block in differentiation by a mechanism that does not require Meis gene expression or interaction with Pbx through the PIM.","['Calvo, K R', 'Sykes, D B', 'Pasillas, M', 'Kamps, M P']","['Calvo KR', 'Sykes DB', 'Pasillas M', 'Kamps MP']","['Department of Pathology, School of Medicine, University of California San Diego, La Jolla, California 92093-0612, USA. krcalvo@ucsd.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,IM,"['Animals', 'Blotting, Northern', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Estrogens/metabolism', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/*metabolism', 'Granulocytes/*metabolism', 'Homeodomain Proteins/genetics/*metabolism/*physiology', 'Immunoblotting', 'Macrophages/*cytology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mutation', 'Myeloid Ecotropic Viral Integration Site 1 Protein', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*metabolism', 'Neutrophils/*cytology', 'Phenotype', 'Plasmids', 'Recombinant Proteins/metabolism', 'Retroviridae/genetics', 'Time Factors', 'Transcriptional Activation']",2000/04/11 09:00,2000/05/20 09:00,['2000/04/11 09:00'],"['2000/04/11 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/05/20 09:00 [medline]', '2000/04/11 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/MCB.20.9.3274-3285.2000 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 2000 May;20(9):3274-85. doi: 10.1128/MCB.20.9.3274-3285.2000.,"['0 (Estrogens)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (Meis1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Myeloid Ecotropic Viral Integration Site 1 Protein)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (homeobox protein HOXA9)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",,PMC85621,,"['T32 CA077109/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA56876/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA77109-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', '5P0CA23100-16/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA023100/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA056876/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here we show that Evi9 encodes a novel zinc finger protein with three tissue-specific isoforms: Evi9a (773 amino acids [aa]) contains two C(2)H(2)-type zinc finger motifs, a proline-rich region, and an acidic domain; Evi9b (486 aa) lacks the first zinc finger motif and part of the proline-rich region; Evi9c (239 aa) lacks all but the first zinc finger motif. Proviral integration sites are located in the first intron of the gene and lead to increased gene expression. Evi9a and Evi9c, but not Evi9b, show transforming activity for NIH 3T3 cells, suggesting that Evi9 is a dominantly acting proto-oncogene. Immunolocalization studies show that Evi9c is restricted to the cytoplasm whereas Evi9a and Evi9b are located in the nucleus, where they form a speckled localization pattern identical to that observed for BCL6, a human B-cell proto-oncogene product. Coimmunoprecipitation and glutathione S-transferase pull-down experiments show that Evi9a and Evi9b, but not Evi9c, physically interact with BCL6, while deletion mutagenesis localized the interaction domains in or near the second zinc finger and POZ domains of Evi9 and BCL6, respectively. These results suggest that Evi9 is a leukemia disease gene that functions, in part, through its interaction with BCL6.","['Nakamura, T', 'Yamazaki, Y', 'Saiki, Y', 'Moriyama, M', 'Largaespada, D A', 'Jenkins, N A', 'Copeland, N G']","['Nakamura T', 'Yamazaki Y', 'Saiki Y', 'Moriyama M', 'Largaespada DA', 'Jenkins NA', 'Copeland NG']","['The Cancer Institute, Japanese Foundation for Cancer Research, Toshima-ku, Tokyo 170-8455, Japan. takuro-ind@umin.u-tokyo,ac.jp']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,IM,"['3T3 Cells', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'COS Cells', 'Carrier Proteins/*chemistry/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'DNA, Complementary/metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*metabolism', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', '*Nuclear Proteins', 'Plasmids', 'Precipitin Tests', 'Protein Isoforms', 'Proto-Oncogene Mas', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-6', 'Repressor Proteins', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Transcription Factors/*metabolism', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', '*Zinc Fingers']",2000/04/11 09:00,2000/05/20 09:00,['2000/04/11 09:00'],"['2000/04/11 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/05/20 09:00 [medline]', '2000/04/11 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/MCB.20.9.3178-3186.2000 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 2000 May;20(9):3178-86. doi: 10.1128/MCB.20.9.3178-3186.2000.,"['0 (BCL11A protein, human)', '0 (Bcl11a protein, mouse)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (MAS1 protein, human)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Protein Isoforms)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Mas)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-6)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",,PMC85612,,,,,,,,"['GENBANK/AF169036', 'GENBANK/AF169037']",,,,,,,,,,

BM stromal cells were transduced with an intron-based Moloney murine leukemia virus (Mo-MuLV) retroviral vector that contained the B domain-deleted human factor VIII (FVIIIdeltaB) cDNA. This FVIII-retroviral vector was pseudotyped with the gibbon ape leukemia virus envelope (GALV-env) to attain higher transduction efficiencies. Using optimized transduction methods, high in vitro FVIII expression levels of 700 to 2500 mU of FVIII/10(6) cells per 24 hr were achieved without selective enrichment of the transduced BM stromal cells. After xenografting of 1.5-3 x 106 engineered BM stromal cells into the spleen of nonobese diabetic severe combined immunodeficient (NOD-SCID) mice, human plasma FVIII levels rose to 13 +/- 4 ng/ml but declined to basal levels by 3 weeks postinjection because of promoter inactivation. About 10% of these stromal cells engrafted in the spleen and persisted for at least 4 months after transplantation in the absence of myeloablative conditioning. No human BM stromal cells could be detected in other organs. These findings indicate that retroviral vector-mediated gene therapy using engineered BM stromal cells may lead to therapeutic levels of FVIII in vivo and that long-term engraftment of human BM stromal cells was achieved in the absence of myeloablative conditioning and without neo-organs. Hence, BM stromal cells may be useful for gene therapy of hemophilia A, provided prolonged expression can be achieved by using alternative promoters.","['Chuah, M K', 'Van Damme, A', 'Zwinnen, H', 'Goovaerts, I', 'Vanslembrouck, V', 'Collen, D', 'VandenDriessche, T']","['Chuah MK', 'Van Damme A', 'Zwinnen H', 'Goovaerts I', 'Vanslembrouck V', 'Collen D', 'VandenDriessche T']","['Center for Transgene Technology and Gene Therapy, Flanders Interuniversity Institute for Biotechnology, University of Leuven, Belgium.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Hum Gene Ther,Human gene therapy,9008950,IM,"['Animals', 'Bone Marrow Cells/*physiology/virology', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Factor VIII/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mice, SCID', 'Recombinant Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Retroviridae/*genetics', 'Stromal Cells/*physiology/virology']",2000/04/11 09:00,2000/06/08 09:00,['2000/04/11 09:00'],"['2000/04/11 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/06/08 09:00 [medline]', '2000/04/11 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1089/10430340050015626 [doi]'],ppublish,Hum Gene Ther. 2000 Mar 20;11(5):729-38. doi: 10.1089/10430340050015626.,"['0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '9001-27-8 (Factor VIII)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study examines how large tumors might suppress the T cell functions and escape from the immune responses elicited by a granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF)-secreting tumor vaccine. According to our results, the T cells isolated from the tumor-bearing mice treated late with the vaccine failed to confer protective activity on naive mice against a wild-type tumor challenge, unlike those isolated from the early-treated group. Nevertheless, the antitumor activity of the inactive T cells could be restored on in vitro stimulation. Expression of transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta) and interleukin 10 (IL-10), the potent immunosuppressive factors, was detected in the parental tumor cell line RLmale 1 (a murine T leukemia cell line), as well as in the tumor region, the levels of which correlated with tumor progression. An in vitro assay of T cell functions revealed that the TGF-beta in the conditioned medium of RLmale 1 cells mainly affected the activation, whereas the IL-1male affected the activation to a lesser extent, but significantly affected the cytolytic activity, of tumor-specific T cells. The immunosuppressive activity of IL-10 was also signified by the findings that administration of the conditioned medium of RLmale 1 cultured in a serum-free medium, in which the TGF-beta activity was then lost while the IL-10 activity still remained, or of recombinant IL-10 to the early-treated group of mice abrogated the known efficacy of tumor vaccine on the small tumors. These data suggested that the efficacy of cytokine-secreting tumor vaccine was blocked by the immunosuppressive factors secreted from the large tumors. The results have important implications for the clinical design of immunotherapeutic strategies for advanced cancer patients.","['Hsieh, C L', 'Chen, D S', 'Hwang, L H']","['Hsieh CL', 'Chen DS', 'Hwang LH']","['Graduate Institute of Microbiology, College of Medicine, National Taiwan University, Taipei.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Hum Gene Ther,Human gene therapy,9008950,IM,"['Animals', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/drug effects/immunology', 'Cancer Vaccines/*immunology/pharmacology', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Culture Media, Conditioned/pharmacology', 'Cytokines/*metabolism', 'Immunosuppression Therapy', 'Immunotherapy/methods', 'Interleukin-10/immunology/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Experimental/immunology/therapy', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Neoplasms, Experimental/*immunology/pathology/therapy', 'Recombinant Proteins/pharmacology', 'T-Lymphocytes/drug effects/immunology', 'Transforming Growth Factor beta/metabolism']",2000/04/11 09:00,2000/06/08 09:00,['2000/04/11 09:00'],"['2000/04/11 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/06/08 09:00 [medline]', '2000/04/11 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1089/10430340050015581 [doi]'],ppublish,Hum Gene Ther. 2000 Mar 20;11(5):681-92. doi: 10.1089/10430340050015581.,"['0 (Cancer Vaccines)', '0 (Culture Media, Conditioned)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Transforming Growth Factor beta)', '130068-27-8 (Interleukin-10)']",,,,,['Hum Gene Ther. 2000 Mar 20;11(5):657-8.

In this study, we have re-evaluated the anti-leukemic effects of natural human IFN-gamma (nHuIFN-gamma) using an established human myelogenous leukemia model in SCID mice. MATERIALS AND METHODS: SCID mice transplanted with human myelogenous leukemia cell line ML-2S received subcutaneously 5 x 10(4) IU/mouse of nHuIFN-gamma at 5 times/week for 5 weeks. RESULT: nHuIFN-gamma significantly prolonged the lifespan of SCID mice in leukemic crisis. Percentages of ML-2S cells in the peripheral blood were also significantly decreased by the IFN-gamma treatment. Histopathological examination revealed that IFN-gamma treatment suppressed the replacement of pancreatic cells by tumor cells and the formation of tumor masses in the intestine. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that IFN-gamma is effective against human myeloid leukemia, especially extramedullary tumor mass-forming type in the peritoneal organs. Our results further suggest that studies employing SCID mice leukemia model would help in devising appropriate therapeutic strategies of IFN-gamma based on the specific characteristics of each leukemia subtype.","['Arai, C', 'Tsuzaki, Y', 'Nagano, Y']","['Arai C', 'Tsuzaki Y', 'Nagano Y']","['Nagano Laboratory, Hayashibara Biochemical Labs, Inc., Okayama, Japan. fujisaki@hayashibara.co.jp']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Greece,In Vivo,"In vivo (Athens, Greece)",8806809,IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', '*Disease Models, Animal', 'Humans', 'Interferon-gamma/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Longevity/drug effects', 'Male', 'Mice', '*Mice, SCID', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2000/04/11 09:00,2000/06/24 11:00,['2000/04/11 09:00'],"['2000/04/11 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/06/24 11:00 [medline]', '2000/04/11 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,In Vivo. 1999 Nov-Dec;13(6):445-51.,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The aim of the present study was to analyze Spanish experience regarding the incidence and characteristics of sMDS and sAML following autologous transplantation. DESIGN AND METHODS: We obtained information from 7 institutions which perform autologous transplantation in Spain. Data from 1,081 and 1,411 patients who had received allogeneic and autologous transplantation, respectively, were available. RESULTS: None of the allografted patients had developed a sMDS/sAML so far. Thirteen cases of sMDS/sAML following autologous transplantation were reported. The mean age of these 13 patients at the time of transplantation was 40 years (range 16-58). Five had non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, 6 had Hodgkin's disease, 1 had acute myeloblastic leukemia and 1 had multiple myeloma. The crude overall incidence of sMDS/sAML was 0.9%. The incidence did not differ according to the source of progenitor cells (1% and 0.8% for bone marrow and peripheral blood, respectively). Cytogenetic analysis showed clonal abnormalities in 11 of the 13 cases. Patients with sMDS/sAML had received more doses of alkylating agents than non-sMDS patients (p = 0.0015). The median time between transplantation and diagnosis of sMDS/sAML was 28 months (range 1.5-63). This time was significantly longer for patients who received bone marrow than for those who received peripheral blood (45 versus 18 months, p = 0.01). Median overall survival after diagnosis of sMDS/sAML was 13 months. INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: The crude incidence of sMDS/sAML in our series was similar to other published incidences. We did not find any difference in incidence between patients who had received bone marrow or peripheral blood; however, the medi an time elapsed between transplantation and sMDS diagnosis was shorter when peripheral blood was infused. Higher doses of alkylating agents were associated with the appearance of sMDS/AML.","['Del Canizo, M f', 'Amigo, M f', 'Hernandez, J M', 'Sanz, G', 'Nunez, R', 'Carreras, E', 'Alegre, A', 'Cuesta, B', 'Mataix, R']","['Del Canizo Mf', 'Amigo Mf', 'Hernandez JM', 'Sanz G', 'Nunez R', 'Carreras E', 'Alegre A', 'Cuesta B', 'Mataix R']","['Servicio de Hematologia, Hospital Universitario de Salamanca, P masculine de San Vicente, 58-182, 37007-Salamanca, Spain. concarol@gugu.usal.es.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating/administration & dosage/toxicity', 'Cytogenetics', 'Female', 'Hodgkin Disease/complications/therapy', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*etiology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/complications/therapy', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/complications/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multiple Myeloma/complications/therapy', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*etiology', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/*etiology', 'Spain', 'Transplantation, Autologous/*adverse effects', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",2000/04/11 09:00,2000/07/06 11:00,['2000/04/11 09:00'],"['2000/04/11 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/07/06 11:00 [medline]', '2000/04/11 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Haematologica. 2000 Apr;85(4):403-9.,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The same region harbors the AML1 gene. The aim of the present study was to investigate whether AML1 is a target gene in these amplifications. DESIGN AND METHODS: Bone marrow samples were obtained from 112 childhood ALL patients. The copy number of AML1 was studied using fluorescent in situ hybridization with a dual color DNA probe specific for the AML1 and TEL genes. RESULTS: Three of the patients had 3-to-8 fold amplification of AML1 and showed a high-level amplification of 21q22 by comparative genomic hybridization. In two of them the extra copies were shown to be located tandemly in a derivative of chromosome 21. Thirty-seven of the patients (33%) had 1-to-2 extra copies of AML1, most probably reflecting the incidence of trisomy 21 and tetrasomy 21. The TEL-AML1 fusion was less frequent in the patients with extra copies of AML1 (7/40; 18%) than in the patients with no extra copy (24/72; 33%). None of the three patients with 3-to-8 fold amplification of AML1 showed the fusion or loss of TEL. INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that the AML1 gene is a target gene in the 21q22 amplicon in childhood ALL. To understand the role, if any, of the AML1 amplification in leukemogenesis, further studies are needed.","['Niini, T', 'Kanerva, J', 'Vettenranta, K', 'Saarinen-Pihkala, U M', 'Knuutila, S']","['Niini T', 'Kanerva J', 'Vettenranta K', 'Saarinen-Pihkala UM', 'Knuutila S']","['Department of Medical Genetics, Haartman Institute and Helsinki University Central Hospital, University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Bone Marrow Cells/metabolism', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 21', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics', 'Female', 'Gene Amplification/genetics', 'Gene Dosage', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics', '*Proto-Oncogene Proteins', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics']",2000/04/11 09:00,2000/07/06 11:00,['2000/04/11 09:00'],"['2000/04/11 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/07/06 11:00 [medline]', '2000/04/11 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Haematologica. 2000 Apr;85(4):362-6.,"['0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (RUNX1 protein, human)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Preliminary experiments were performed to compare avidin endocytosis into cells incubated with biotinylated antibodies. Antibody biotinylation resulted in the endocytosis of avidin-FITC into nearly 100% of cells compared with no detectable binding or entry into unbiotinylated cells. Gene transfer was accomplished with avidin conjugated to polyethylenimine (PEI) at a molar ratio of 4:1 (PA4). Plasmid DNA encoding the green fluorescent protein (GFP) gene was condensed on the PA4, and transfection efficiencies were measured by flow cytometry as the percentage of cells that fluoresced at levels greater than two standard deviations above the negative control. Gene transfer efficiencies were compared among K562, HEL, and Jurkat leukemia cell lines. Control transfections with DNA alone or untargeted PEI-DNA resulted in </=2% GFP positive cells. Targeting PEI-avidin-DNA to antibody biotinylated cells increased transfection efficiency several fold over untargeted PEI. For each cell type, the increase in transfection efficiency was not significantly different among four biotinylated antibodies tested (antiCD55, antiCD59, antiCD71, and antiCD98). These data suggest biotinylated antibodies may be useful for targeting polyethylenimine-avidin mediated gene transfer.","['Wojda, U', 'Miller, J L']","['Wojda U', 'Miller JL']","['Laboratory of Chemical Biology, National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, National Institutes of Health, 9000 Rockville Pike, Bethesda, Maryland 20892, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Pharm Sci,Journal of pharmaceutical sciences,2985195R,IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/*metabolism', 'Antigens, Surface', 'Avidin/*metabolism', 'Biotinylation', 'CD59 Antigens/immunology', 'DNA/*metabolism', 'Endocytosis', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Transfer Techniques', 'Genetic Vectors', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Polyethyleneimine/*metabolism', 'Transfection/methods']",2000/04/11 09:00,2000/08/06 11:00,['2000/04/11 09:00'],"['2000/04/11 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/08/06 11:00 [medline]', '2000/04/11 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0022-3549(16)30590-1 [pii]', '10.1002/(SICI)1520-6017(200005)89:5<674::AID-JPS13>3.0.CO;2-3 [doi]']",ppublish,J Pharm Sci. 2000 May;89(5):674-81. doi: 10.1002/(SICI)1520-6017(200005)89:5<674::AID-JPS13>3.0.CO;2-3.,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, Surface)', '0 (CD59 Antigens)', '1405-69-2 (Avidin)', '9002-98-6 (Polyethyleneimine)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",,,"['Copyright 2000 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A previous study localized the breakpoints of two acquired isodicentric X chromosomes associated with myelodysplasia to a 450-kb region proximal to the XIST gene. Here we report the construction and extensive characterization of a reliable 1-Mb P1 artificial chromosome and bacterial artificial chromosome contig covering a highly problematic region in Xq13 that includes the previously described isodicentric breakpoint region. In addition to mapping of the brain-specific gene (NAP1L2) and the phosphoglyceryl kinase alpha subunit 1 gene (PHKA1) and generation and mapping of a large number of STSs throughout the contig, we have mapped a putative transcriptional regulatory protein (HDACL1), and 35 ESTs. Sequencing data, Southern blot analysis, and fiber-FISH analysis have permitted characterization of extensive region-specific duplications and triplications in addition to an unusually high concentration of long interspersed repeat elements, both of which could be implicated in isodicentric chromosome formation and other Xq13 chromosome aberrations. FISH analysis of metaphase chromosomes from two previously unpublished AML patients and one preleukemic patient using cosmid clones and selected subclones allowed mapping of the idic(X)(q13) breakpoints to a 100-kb interval, consistent with the involvement of an X-linked gene in the genesis of this form of preleukemia, disruption of which may represent a preliminary step in progression to AML. Assembly and physical mapping of this complex 1-Mb contig establish a foundation for ongoing sequencing and gene identification projects in the region.","['McDonell, N', 'Ramser, J', 'Francis, F', 'Vinet, M C', 'Rider, S', 'Sudbrak, R', 'Riesselman, L', 'Yaspo, M L', 'Reinhardt, R', 'Monaco, A P', 'Ross, F', 'Kahn, A', 'Kearney, L', 'Buckle, V', 'Chelly, J']","['McDonell N', 'Ramser J', 'Francis F', 'Vinet MC', 'Rider S', 'Sudbrak R', 'Riesselman L', 'Yaspo ML', 'Reinhardt R', 'Monaco AP', 'Ross F', 'Kahn A', 'Kearney L', 'Buckle V', 'Chelly J']","['Institut Cochin de Genetique Moleculaire, INSERM Unite 129, CHU Cochin-Port-Royal, 24 Rue du Faubourg Saint Jacques, Paris, 75014, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Genomics,Genomics,8800135,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Aged', 'Blotting, Southern', 'Centromere', '*Chromosome Breakage', 'Chromosomes, Artificial, Yeast', 'Chromosomes, Bacterial', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Contig Mapping', 'Cosmids', 'Expressed Sequence Tags', 'Female', 'Gene Duplication', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*genetics', 'Long Interspersed Nucleotide Elements', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/genetics', 'Preleukemia/*genetics', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA', 'Sex Chromosome Aberrations/*genetics', '*X Chromosome']",2000/04/11 09:00,2000/06/03 09:00,['2000/04/11 09:00'],"['2000/04/11 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/06/03 09:00 [medline]', '2000/04/11 09:00 [entrez]']","['10.1006/geno.2000.6128 [doi]', 'S0888-7543(00)96128-7 [pii]']",ppublish,Genomics. 2000 Mar 15;64(3):221-9. doi: 10.1006/geno.2000.6128.,,,,['Copyright 2000 Academic Press.'],,,,,,,['GENBANK/AJ239200'],,,,,,,,,,

Southern blot analysis of koala tissue genomic DNA using labelled KoRV probes demonstrated banding consistent with an endogenous retrovirus. Complete and apparently truncated proviruses were detected in DNA of both clinically normal koalas and those with hematopoietic disease. KoRV-related viruses were not detected in other marsupials, and phylogenetic analysis showed that KoRV paradoxically clusters with gibbon ape leukemia virus (GALV).

The mechanisms of virus pathogenesis are still obscure. The occurrence of defective proviruses in HTLV-1-infected cell lines and the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) of infected individuals is a frequent feature of virus infection. We detected defective proviruses with large internal deletions in PBMC from ATLL and HAM/TSP patients and in asymptomatic HTLV-1 carriers. Seventeen PCR-amplified defective proviruses were sequenced, and three types of deletions were found. Besides truncated MA and the 5' end of the genome, truncated CA, truncated SU, and more frequently truncated TM linked to the pX region were detected. Reverse transcription-PCR analysis of PBMC from ATLL patients and asymptomatic carriers also revealed RNA transcripts with large internal deletions. Analysis of two RT-PCR cDNA clones confirmed a Gag-TM-pX structure of the transcripts. Most defective proviruses contained numerous internal stop codons, but some were capable of coding for the truncated MA linked to a variable out-of-frame peptide. Cloned defective proviruses with long open reading frames were subjected to in vitro transcription-translation followed by radioimmunoprecipitation, which showed expression of chimeric proteins between 8 and 12 kDa. Possible roles of defective proviruses and chimeric proteins are discussed, although there is no firm association with pathogenesis.","['Morozov, V A', 'Lagaye, S', 'Taylor, G P', 'Matutes, E', 'Weiss, R A']","['Morozov VA', 'Lagaye S', 'Taylor GP', 'Matutes E', 'Weiss RA']","['Institute of Cancer Research and Royal Marsden Hospital, London SW3 6JB, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,IM,"[""5' Untranslated Regions"", 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Base Sequence', 'Blotting, Southern/methods', 'Cell Line, Transformed', 'DNA, Viral', 'Defective Viruses/*genetics', 'Gene Products, gag/*genetics', 'Genome, Viral', 'HTLV-I Infections/*virology', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/virology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction/methods', 'Proviruses/*genetics', 'Retroviridae Proteins, Oncogenic/*genetics', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction/methods', '*Sequence Deletion', '*Transcription Factors', 'Viral Envelope Proteins/*genetics', 'Viral Matrix Proteins/genetics', 'Viral Regulatory and Accessory Proteins']",2001/02/07 11:00,2001/02/07 11:01,['2001/02/07 11:00'],"['2001/02/07 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/07 11:01 [medline]', '2001/02/07 11:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/jvi.74.9.3933-3940.2000 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 2000 May;74(9):3933-40. doi: 10.1128/jvi.74.9.3933-3940.2000.,"[""0 (5' Untranslated Regions)"", '0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (Gene Products, gag)', '0 (Retroviridae Proteins, Oncogenic)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)', '0 (Viral Matrix Proteins)', '0 (Viral Regulatory and Accessory Proteins)', '0 (pX protein, Human T-lymphotropic virus 1)']",,PMC111906,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we report the molecular cloning of a GATA-3 interacting protein, repressor of GATA (ROG). ROG is a lymphoid-specific gene and is rapidly induced in Th cells upon stimulation with anti-CD3. In in vitro assays, ROG represses the GATA-3-induced transactivation. Furthermore, overexpression of ROG in Th clones inhibits the production of Th cytokines.

To broaden our understanding of the inflammatory mediators involved in IRI, we used multi-probe RNase protection assays to examine the expression of 26 different cytokine genes in a murine model of renal IRI. We observed that, in addition to up-regulation of IL-1beta and to a lesser extent TNF-alpha, IRI was associated with an intense and sustained up-regulation of three gp130-signaling cytokines, IL-6, IL-11, and leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), as well as with up-regulation of the neutrophil chemotactic and activating mediator macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)-2. Macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF) and monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP)-1 were also moderately up-regulated after IRI, whereas mRNA levels of several other inflammatory mediators including IL-1alpha, IL-2, IL-4, interferon (IFN)-gamma, GM-CSF, and RANTES were minimally increased or remained undetectable.

Cancer incidence among the offspring was compared with that in the corresponding childhood population of Denmark.

The SIR for myeloid leukaemia was 0.78 (95% CI 0.28-1.69). The increases in melanoma of the skin and cancer of the lip and tongue among patients with NHL strongly suggest sunlight exposure as a shared causal agent. The increase in soft tissue sarcomas might be due to shared effects of exposure to chemicals such as phenoxy acid herbicides. The increases in bladder and thyroid cancers are likely to be explained by effects of treatment for NHL.

However, its prevalence in individuals infected with human T-cell leukaemia virus type I (HTLV-I), another important member of the human retrovirus family, has not been previously investigated. OBJECTIVE: To establish the prevalence of H. pylori in HTLV-I-positive individuals in the Nagasaki Prefecture, which is an area endemic for HTLV-I. METHODS: We examined sera from 146 HTLV-I-positive individuals with a mean age of 56.7 years, consisting of 45 adult T-cell leukaemia (ATL) patients, 13 HTLV-I-associated myelopathy (HAM) patients and 88 healthy carriers. Serum samples of 292 age- and sex-matched HTLV-I-negative controls were also examined. Serum anti-H. pylori immunoglobulin (Ig) G antibody was examined using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit. Twenty-eight HTLV-I-positive patients were examined endoscopically, assessed for H. pylori by culture, histology and CLO test using gastric biopsy specimens, and gastritis in these patients was also graded histologically. RESULTS: The seroprevalence of H. pylori was 48% in HTLV-I-positive individuals versus 64% in HTLV-I-negative controls (P < 0.01). In the three HTLV-I-positive groups, ATL patients and carriers had significantly lower seroprevalence of H. pylori than the HTLV-I-negative controls (P < 0.05). Assessment of H. pylori using gastric biopsy specimens also showed a significantly lower prevalence of H. pylori infection in HTLV-I-positive patients than controls (46% versus 70%, P < 0.05). Histological examination showed a significantly higher degree of activity, inflammation and glandular atrophy in the antrum and corpus in H. pylori-positive patients compared to H. pylori-negative patients. H. pylori-positive patients with HTLV-I infection had a more severe degree of glandular atrophy in the corpus than H. pylori-positive controls without HTLV-I infection. CONCLUSION: We have found a reduced prevalence of H. pylori in HTLV-I-positive individuals. Whatever the explanation, infection with HTLV-I does not predispose to the risk of H. pylori infection.","['Isomoto, H', 'Mizuta, Y', 'Fukushima, K', 'Takeshima, F', 'Miyazaki, M', 'Murase, K', 'Omagari, K', 'Maeda, T', 'Kamihira, S', 'Tomonaga, M', 'Kohno, S']","['Isomoto H', 'Mizuta Y', 'Fukushima K', 'Takeshima F', 'Miyazaki M', 'Murase K', 'Omagari K', 'Maeda T', 'Kamihira S', 'Tomonaga M', 'Kohno S']","['Second Department of Internal Medicine, Nagasaki University School of Medicine, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Eur J Gastroenterol Hepatol,European journal of gastroenterology & hepatology,9000874,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Comorbidity', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Female', 'HTLV-I Infections/*epidemiology', 'Helicobacter Infections/*epidemiology', '*Helicobacter pylori', 'Humans', 'Japan/epidemiology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prevalence', 'Sensitivity and Specificity']",2001/02/07 11:00,2001/02/07 11:01,['2001/02/07 11:00'],"['2001/02/07 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/07 11:01 [medline]', '2001/02/07 11:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/00042737-199905000-00006 [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Gastroenterol Hepatol. 1999 May;11(5):497-502. doi: 10.1097/00042737-199905000-00006.,,,,,,['Eur J Gastroenterol Hepatol. 1999 May;11(5):481-3.

Currently, ex vivo survival of leukemic cell survival is measured by coculture on stromal cell monolayers. In these assays, we postulated that two important sources of error might be introduced through either variations in flow volume or in donor stromal cells. METHODS: A previously reported coculture assay that maintains leukemic cells on bone marrow stromal cells was employed. RESULTS: We identified two means of optimizing the coculture assay. First, biologically inert beads having well-characterized fluorescent properties were added to each sample to mathematically adjust for flow-based variations in volume acquisition. The inclusion of fluorescent beads to the basic stromal cell assay showed a significantly lower coefficient of variation as compared to samples analyzed without beads or manually counted using a hemacytometer. Second, in order to minimize variability in bone marrow hematopoietic function between donors, an adherent stromal cell line known to support hematopoiesis (HS-5) was used. When normal human donor stromal cells were used, variability in the survival of leukemic cells was observed on stromal cells derived from different donors. In contrast, statistically significant variability in survival of leukemic cells was not seen on HS-5 monolayers. Finally, we demonstrate that patient-derived leukemic samples may be examined for cell survival using these modifications. CONCLUSIONS: The novel use of fluorescent beads and a hematopoietic-supportive stromal cell line together makes the quantification of stroma-supported cell survival more reproducible, accurate, and amenable to patient-derived samples. These improvements in flow cytometry-based cell quantification are an important step in establishing a role for stromal cell assays in the study of leukemia biology and therapy.","['Winter, S S', 'Sweatman, J J', 'Larson, R S']","['Winter SS', 'Sweatman JJ', 'Larson RS']","['Department of Pediatrics, University of New Mexico Health Sciences Center, Albuquerque, NM 87131, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cytometry,Cytometry,8102328,IM,"['Bone Marrow Cells/*cytology', 'Cell Culture Techniques/*methods', 'Cell Line, Transformed/cytology', 'Cell Survival/physiology', 'Flow Cytometry/*methods/standards', 'Fluorescent Dyes', 'Hematopoiesis/physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell', 'Microspheres', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Stromal Cells/*cytology']",2000/04/08 09:00,2000/06/03 09:00,['2000/04/08 09:00'],"['2000/04/08 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/06/03 09:00 [medline]', '2000/04/08 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/(SICI)1097-0320(20000501)40:1<26::AID-CYTO4>3.0.CO;2-0 [pii]'],ppublish,Cytometry. 2000 May 1;40(1):26-31.,['0 (Fluorescent Dyes)'],,,"['Copyright 2000 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Late apoptotic events such as DNA-strand breaks can be assayed by in situ end labeling (ISEL) and DNA measurement (sub G1) using flow cytometry. Phosphatidylserine (PS) redistribution from the inner plasma membrane leaflet to the outer leaflet, an early event in PCD, can be detected by annexin V (AxV) binding to PS. AxV-fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) fluorescence intensity is variable and characterizes different cell populations, denoted here as AxV-negative (AxV(neg)), AxV-low-positive (AxV(lo)), and AxV-high-positive (AxV(hi)). METHODS: We investigate the correlation of three methods (ISEL, sub G1 DNA content, and AxV assay) for detecting apoptosis with focus on differences between populations with different levels of PS. We also examined the expression of PCD-regulating Bcl-2 family members in these cell populations by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) cells exposed to fludarabine (FAMP) were used as an in vitro model. Cells with different PS/AxV levels were separated using fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS). RESULTS: Only purified AxV(hi) cells had high positivity in the ISEL and sub G1 assays (94 +/- 0.6%, 88.6 +/- 6.6%, and 98.6 +/- 0.6%, respectively), indicating that late apoptotic cells are detected equally by all three methods. In the AxV(lo) population, ISEL was positive in 21% +/- 13% and DNA sub G1 in 20% +/- 6.6% of cells, suggesting that AxV identifies early apoptotic cells better than the other assays. Anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 and Bcl-X(L) were upregulated by FAMP when cells entered apoptosis (AxV(lo)), as was pro-apo- ptotic Bcl-X(S), which was undetectable in nonapoptotic AxV(neg) cells. Pro-apoptotic Bax was only expressed in AxV(neg) and AxV(lo) cells. Late apoptotic AxV(hi) cells did not express Bcl-X(S) or Bax. RESULTS: (1) AxV staining is more sensitive than sub G1 or ISEL in detecting early apoptotic cells; (2) only late apoptotic cells are equally detected by all assays; (3) AxV is a valuable tool in the detection and isolation of apoptotic cells at different stages of PCD; and (4) pro-apoptotic Bcl-X(S) and Bax are expressed at early, not late, stages of apoptosis.","['Clodi, K', 'Kliche, K O', 'Zhao, S', 'Weidner, D', 'Schenk, T', 'Consoli, U', 'Jiang, S', 'Snell, V', 'Andreeff, M']","['Clodi K', 'Kliche KO', 'Zhao S', 'Weidner D', 'Schenk T', 'Consoli U', 'Jiang S', 'Snell V', 'Andreeff M']","['Department of Molecular Hematology and Therapy, The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cytometry,Cytometry,8102328,IM,"['Annexin A5/analysis', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects/genetics', 'Cell Membrane/chemistry/metabolism', 'DNA Fragmentation', 'Flow Cytometry', 'G1 Phase/drug effects/genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects/immunology', 'Humans', 'In Situ Nick-End Labeling', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/genetics/*metabolism', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/chemistry/*cytology/metabolism', 'Phosphatidylserines/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'Vidarabine/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology']",2000/04/08 09:00,2000/06/03 09:00,['2000/04/08 09:00'],"['2000/04/08 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/06/03 09:00 [medline]', '2000/04/08 09:00 [entrez]']","['10.1002/(SICI)1097-0320(20000501)40:1<19::AID-CYTO3>3.0.CO;2-3 [pii]', '10.1002/(sici)1097-0320(20000501)40:1<19::aid-cyto3>3.0.co;2-3 [doi]']",ppublish,Cytometry. 2000 May 1;40(1):19-25. doi: 10.1002/(sici)1097-0320(20000501)40:1<19::aid-cyto3>3.0.co;2-3.,"['0 (Annexin A5)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Phosphatidylserines)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'P2K93U8740 (fludarabine)']",,,"['Copyright 2000 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']","['CA 16672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 49639/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P0 1 CA 55164/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A newly identified CX3C chemokine, fractalkine, expressed on activated endothelial cells, plays an important role in leukocyte adhesion and migration. We examined the functional effects of fractalkine on beta1 and beta2 integrin-mediated adhesion using a macrophage-like cell line, THP-1 cells. In this study, we report that THP-1 cells express mRNA encoding a receptor for fractalkine, CX3CR1, determined by Northern blotting. Scatchard analysis using fractalkine-SEAP (secreted form of placental alkaline phosphatase) chimeric proteins revealed that THP-1 cells express a single class of CX3CR1 with a dissociation constant of 30 pM and a mean expression of 440 sites per cell. THP-1 cells efficiently adhered, in a fractalkine-dependent manner, to full-length of fractalkine immobilized onto plastic and to the membrane-bound form of fractalkine expressed on ECV304 cells or TNF-alpha-activated HUVECs. Moreover, soluble-fractalkine enhanced adhesion of THP-1 cells to fibronectin and ICAM-1 in a dose-dependent manner. Pertussis toxin, an inhibitor of Gi, inhibited the fractalkine-mediated enhancement of THP-1 cell adhesion to fibronectin and ICAM-1. Finally, we found that soluble-fractalkine also enhanced adhesion of freshly separated monocytes to fibronectin and ICAM-1. These results indicate that fractalkine may induce firm adhesion between monocytes and endothelial cells not only through an intrinsic adhesion function itself, but also through activation of integrin avidity for their ligands.","['Goda, S', 'Imai, T', 'Yoshie, O', 'Yoneda, O', 'Inoue, H', 'Nagano, Y', 'Okazaki, T', 'Imai, H', 'Bloom, E T', 'Domae, N', 'Umehara, H']","['Goda S', 'Imai T', 'Yoshie O', 'Yoneda O', 'Inoue H', 'Nagano Y', 'Okazaki T', 'Imai H', 'Bloom ET', 'Domae N', 'Umehara H']","['Departments ofInternal Medicine and Periodontology, Osaka Dental University, Hanazono-cho, Hirakata-shi, Osaka, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,IM,"['Adjuvants, Immunologic/biosynthesis/genetics/physiology', 'Alkaline Phosphatase/genetics/metabolism', 'Cell Adhesion/genetics/immunology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chemokine CX3CL1', '*Chemokines, CX3C', 'Chemokines, CXC/biosynthesis/genetics/*physiology', 'Endothelium/cytology/*immunology/metabolism', 'Endothelium, Vascular/cytology/immunology/metabolism', 'Enzymes, Immobilized/genetics', 'Fibronectins/metabolism', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/immunology/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Integrins/*physiology', 'Intercellular Adhesion Molecule-1/metabolism', 'Isoenzymes/genetics/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid', 'Membrane Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics/*physiology', 'Monocytes/immunology', 'Pertussis Toxin', 'Protein Binding/immunology', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/metabolism', 'Solubility', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/physiology', 'Virulence Factors, Bordetella/pharmacology']",2001/02/07 11:00,2001/02/07 11:01,['2001/02/07 11:00'],"['2001/02/07 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/07 11:01 [medline]', '2001/02/07 11:00 [entrez]']","['ji_v164n8p4313 [pii]', '10.4049/jimmunol.164.8.4313 [doi]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 2000 Apr 15;164(8):4313-20. doi: 10.4049/jimmunol.164.8.4313.,"['0 (Adjuvants, Immunologic)', '0 (CX3CL1 protein, human)', '0 (Chemokine CX3CL1)', '0 (Chemokines, CX3C)', '0 (Chemokines, CXC)', '0 (Enzymes, Immobilized)', '0 (Fibronectins)', '0 (Integrins)', '0 (Isoenzymes)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '0 (Virulence Factors, Bordetella)', '0 (germ-cell AP isoenzyme)', '126547-89-5 (Intercellular Adhesion Molecule-1)', 'EC 2.4.2.31 (Pertussis Toxin)', 'EC 3.1.3.1 (Alkaline Phosphatase)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although signal ends can be directly ligated to form signal joints, hairpin coding ends need to be opened and subsequently processed before being joined. However, the underlying mechanism of coding end resolution remains undefined. The current study attempts to delineate this process by analyzing various structures of coding ends made in situ from recombination-inducible pre-B cell lines of both normal and scid mice. These cell lines were derived by transformation of B cell precursors with the temperature-sensitive Abelson murine leukemia virus. Our kinetic analysis revealed that under conditions permissive to scid transformants, hairpin coding ends could be nicked to generate 3' overhangs and then processed into blunt ends. The final joining of these blunt ends followed the same kinetics as signal joint formation. The course of this process is in sharp contrast to coding end resolution in scid heterozygous transformants that express the catalytic subunit of DNA-dependent protein kinase, in which hairpin end opening, processing, and joining proceeded very rapidly and appeared to be closely linked. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the opening of hairpin ends in scid cells could be manipulated by different culture conditions, which ultimately influenced not only the level and integrity of the newly formed coding joints, but also the extent of microhomology at the coding junctions. These results are discussed in the context of scid leaky recombination.","['Brown, M L', 'Chang, Y']","['Brown ML', 'Chang Y']","['Department of Microbiology, Arizona State University, Tempe, AZ 85287, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Culture Techniques/methods', 'Cell Line, Transformed', 'Codon/genetics/*immunology/*metabolism', 'DNA Repair Enzymes', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Gene Rearrangement, B-Lymphocyte/*immunology', 'Immunoglobulin J-Chains/genetics', 'Immunoglobulin kappa-Chains/genetics', 'Kinetics', 'MRE11 Homologue Protein', 'Mice', 'Mice, SCID', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Recombination, Genetic/*immunology', 'Temperature', 'Time Factors', 'Transposases/biosynthesis/genetics']",2001/02/07 11:00,2001/02/07 11:01,['2001/02/07 11:00'],"['2001/02/07 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/07 11:01 [medline]', '2001/02/07 11:00 [entrez]']","['ji_v164n8p4135 [pii]', '10.4049/jimmunol.164.8.4135 [doi]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 2000 Apr 15;164(8):4135-42. doi: 10.4049/jimmunol.164.8.4135.,"['0 (Codon)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Immunoglobulin J-Chains)', '0 (Immunoglobulin kappa-Chains)', '0 (Mre11a protein, mouse)', '0 (Rag2 protein, mouse)', '0 (V(D)J recombination activating protein 2)', 'EC 2.7.7.- (Transposases)', 'EC 3.1.- (MRE11 Homologue Protein)', 'EC 6.5.1.- (DNA Repair Enzymes)']",,,,['CA73857/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The molecular mechanism of leukemogenesis induced by Tax has yet to be elucidated. We analyzed Tax function in the cell cycle using an interleukin-2 (IL-2)-dependent human T-cell line (Kit 225) that can undergo cell cycle arrest at G(0)/G(1) phase by deprivation of IL-2. Tax activated endogenous E2F activity in IL-2-starved Kit 225 cells, resulting in activation of E2F site-carrying promoters of genes involved in G(1) to S phase transition in a cell type-dependent and p16(INK4a)-independent manner. The ability of Tax mutants to activate E2F coincided with that to activate nuclear factors kappaB and AT, sole expression of which, however, did not activate E2F, suggesting involvement of another pathway in activation of E2F. Introduction of Tax by a recombinant adenovirus induced cell cycle progression to G(2)/M phase in resting Kit 225 cells accompanied by endogenous cyclin D2 gene expression. Similarly, Tax-induced cell cycle progression was seen with peripheral blood lymphocytes prestimulated with phytohemagglutinin. Analyses with Tax mutants did not allow Tax-induced cell cycle progression to be differentiated from Tax-dependent activation of E2F, suggesting that Tax induces cell cycle progression presumably through activation of E2F. Nevertheless, infection with an E2F1-expressing virus, which is sufficient for induction of S phase in serum-starved fibroblasts, was not sufficient for either E2F activation or cell cycle progression in IL-2-starved Kit 225 cells, implying differential regulation of E2F activation and cell cycle progression in T-cells that is activated by Tax.","['Ohtani, K', 'Iwanaga, R', 'Arai, M', 'Huang, Y', 'Matsumura, Y', 'Nakamura, M']","['Ohtani K', 'Iwanaga R', 'Arai M', 'Huang Y', 'Matsumura Y', 'Nakamura M']","['Human Gene Sciences Center, School of Medicine, Tokyo Medical and Dental University, 1-5-45 Yushima, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo 113-8510, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,IM,"['Binding Sites', '*Carrier Proteins', 'Cell Cycle', '*Cell Cycle Proteins', 'Cell Line', 'Cyclin D2', 'Cyclins/genetics', '*DNA-Binding Proteins', 'E2F Transcription Factors', 'E2F1 Transcription Factor', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Gene Products, tax/*physiology', 'Genes, p16/physiology', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-2/physiology', 'NF-kappa B/physiology', 'Retinoblastoma-Binding Protein 1', 'Transcription Factor DP1', 'Transcription Factors/*physiology']",2001/02/07 11:00,2001/02/07 11:01,['2001/02/07 11:00'],"['2001/02/07 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/07 11:01 [medline]', '2001/02/07 11:00 [entrez]']","['10.1074/jbc.275.15.11154 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(19)80961-4 [pii]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2000 Apr 14;275(15):11154-63. doi: 10.1074/jbc.275.15.11154.,"['0 (CCND2 protein, human)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (Cyclin D2)', '0 (Cyclins)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (E2F Transcription Factors)', '0 (E2F1 Transcription Factor)', '0 (E2F1 protein, human)', '0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Retinoblastoma-Binding Protein 1)', '0 (Transcription Factor DP1)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Two NPM-RAR molecules are expressed as a result of alternative RNA splicing. Both contain RARalpha sequences that encode the DNA binding, heterodimerization, and ligand activation domains of RARalpha. This study was designed to test the ability of these fusion proteins to act as transcriptional activators of retinoic acid responsive promoters. The NPM-RAR fusion proteins bind to retinoic acid response element sequences as either homodimers or as heterodimers with RXR. Transcription of retinoic acid-inducible promoters is activated by the fusion proteins in the presence of retinoic acid. The level of transactivation induced by the NPM-RAR fusions differs from the level of transactivation induced by wild-type RARalpha in both a promoter and cell specific fashion, and more closely parallels the pattern of activation of the PML-RAR fusion than wild-type RARalpha. In addition, NPM-RAR decreases basal transcription from some promoters and acts in a dominant-negative fashion when co-transfected with wild-type RARalpha. Both NPM-RAR and PML-RAR interact with the co-repressor protein SMRTe in a manner that is less sensitive than RARalpha to dissociation by retinoic acid. Retinoic acid induces binding of the co-activator protein RAC3. These data indicate that the NPM-RAR fusion proteins can modulate expression of retinoid-responsive genes in a positive or negative manner, depending on context of the promoter, and lend support to the hypothesis that aberrant transcriptional activation underlies the APL phenotype.

In this article, using SCID mice xenografted with APL-derived NB4 cells, we demonstrate that CD437 has significant antileukemic activity in vivo. In addition, we report on the isolation and characterization of an APL cell line (NB4.437r) resistant to CD437. The cell line retains expression of PML-RARalpha and is approximately 33-fold more resistant than the parental counterpart to the apoptogenic effects of the retinoid. Resistance is relatively specific to CD437 and structural congeners because the NB4.437r cell line is still sensitive to various types of apoptogenic compounds. The CD437-resistant cell line maintains sensitivity to the antiproliferative and apoptotic action of all-trans-retinoic acid, AM580, and fenretinide, though it shows partial resistance to the cytodifferentiating effects of the first 2 compounds. Resistance to CD437 lays upstream of the CD437-induced release of cytochrome c from the mitochondria and the activation of caspase-3, -7, -8, and -9. Furthermore, NB4.437r cells are deficient in the CD437-dependent activation of nuclear NFkb and AP1-binding activities and in the phosphorylation of the protein kinase Akt. In the case of AP1, deficient assembly of the complex is not caused by the lack of activation of the Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) family of kinases. The novel cell line will be useful in the elucidation of the molecular mechanisms underlying the apoptogenic action of CD437 and structurally related retinoids.

Chimerism was assessed by polymerase chain reaction (VNTR [variable number of tandem repeats]-PCR) analysis in highly purified CD19+, CD3+, CD15+, and CD56+ cell fractions, whereas MRD was investigated in whole blood by reverse transcriptase-PCR (RT-PCR) of both p210(BCR-ABL) and p190(BCR-ABL) hybrid transcripts. Of 55 patients, 14 (including 6 T-cell-depleted patients) had cytogenetic relapse at 5-80 months and progressed to hematologic relapse, while 41 patients remained in prolonged cytogenetic remission 12-107 months post-BMT. Before leukemia recurrence, patients in the relapse group showed a consistent evolution pattern sequentially featured by persistent p210(BCR-ABL) positivity, increasing mixed chimerism (MC) in myeloid cells, p190(BCR-ABL) positivity, and, finally, cytogenetic relapse. Myeloid MC preceded cytogenetic relapse by 2-12 months, whereas p190(BCR/ABL) was detected 1-6 months prior to cytogenetic relapse in 11 patients and concomitant with cytogenetic relapse in 3 patients. In the remission group, all patients invariably tested negative for p190(BCR-ABL); 10 patients tested positive for p210(BCR-ABL) at variable time-points but showed persistent full donor chimerism (DC), whereas 31 patients tested p210(BCR-ABL) negative and displayed full DC or transient MC due to the persistence of recipient T cells. Two patients in the relapse group were successfully reinduced into molecular remission with donor lymphocyte infusion. Sequential molecular analysis after such treatment showed the inverse pattern to that observed prior to relapse, ie, progressive disappearance of p190(BCR-ABL) transcripts, conversion of myeloid chimerism to donor type, and, finally, p210(BCR-ABL) negativity. We conclude that lineage-specific chimerism and p190(BCR-ABL) messenger RNA (mRNA) analyses contribute a better characterization of CML evolution after BMT and enable early identification of patients at the highest risk of relapse.

Nested PCR with patient IgH allele-specific oligonucleotide primers can detect 1 tumor cell in 10(4) to 10(6) normal cells. In childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), persistence of PCR-detectable disease is associated with increased risk of relapse. The clinical significance of qualitative PCR data can be limited, however, because patients can harbor detectable MRD for prolonged periods without relapse. Recent studies indicate that a quantitative rise in tumor burden identifies patients who are at high risk for relapse. Therefore, an efficient and reliable PCR method for MRD quantification is needed for ALL patients. We have developed a real-time PCR method to quantify MRD with IgH V(H) gene family consensus fluorogenically labeled probes. With this method, a small number of probes can be used to quantify MRD in a large number of different patients. The assay was found to be both accurate and reproducible over a wide range and capable of detecting approximately 1 tumor cell in 5 x 10(4) normal cells.

In contrast, only few data are available for hematologic neoplasms. To investigate the role of angiogenesis in acute myeloid leukemia (AML), bone marrow biopsies from 62 adults with newly diagnosed, untreated AML (day 0) were evaluated. Further studies were done after the completion of remission induction chemotherapy (day 16 of induction chemotherapy, n = 21; complete remission, n = 20). Microvessels were scored in at least 3 areas (x500 field, 0.126 mm(2)) of the highest microvessel density in representative sections of each bone marrow specimen using immunohistochemistry for von Willebrand factor and thrombomodulin. Microvessel counts were significantly higher in patients with AML (n = 62) compared with control patients (n = 22): median (interquartile range) 24.0 (21.0-27.8)/x500 field vs 11.2 (10. 0-12.0)/x500 field, respectively (P <.001). On day 16 of induction chemotherapy, microvessel density was reduced by 60% (44-66) (P <. 001) in hypoplastic marrows without residual blasts, in contrast to only 17% (0-37) reduction in hypoplastic marrows with >/= 5% residual blasts (P <.001 for the difference between both groups). Bone marrow biopsies taken at the time of complete remission displayed a microvessel density in the same range as the controls. In conclusion, there is evidence of increased microvessel density in the bone marrow of patients with AML, which supports the hypothesis of an important role of angiogenesis in AML. Furthermore, these findings suggest that antiangiogenic therapy might constitute a novel strategy for the treatment of AML.

We previously showed that ubiquitin (Ub) secreted from hairy cell leukemia cells had inhibitory effects on clonogenic growth of normal hematopoietic progenitor cells. In this study, we examined the effects of exogenous Ub on the growth and survival of a series of human hematopoietic cells, including myeloid cell lines (HL-60 and U937), a B-cell line (Daudi), and T-cell lines (KT-3, MT-4, YTC-3, and MOLT-4). Exogenous Ub inhibited the growth of various hematopoietic cell lines tested, especially of KT-3 and HL-60 cells. The growth-suppressive effects of Ub on KT-3 and HL-60 cells were almost completely abrogated by the proteasome inhibitor PSI or MG132, suggesting the involvement of the proteasome pathway in this process. Furthermore, exogenous Ub evoked severe apoptosis of KT-3 and HL-60 cells through the activation of caspase-3. In interleukin-6 (IL-6)-dependent KT-3 cells, STAT3 was found to be conjugated by exogenous biotinylated Ub and to be degraded in a proteasome-dependent manner, whereas expression levels of STAT1, STAT5, or mitogen-activated protein kinase were not affected. Moreover, IL-6-induced the up-regulation of Bcl-2 and c-myc, and JunB was impaired in Ub-treated KT-3 cells, suggesting that the anti-apoptotic and mitogenic effects of IL-6 were disrupted by Ub. These results suggest that extracellular Ub was incorporated into hematopoietic cells and mediated their growth suppression and apoptosis through proteasome-dependent degradation of selective cellular proteins such as STAT3.

Although it has been shown that progenitor cells of patients with PV are hypersensitive to several growth factors, the molecular pathogenesis of this disease remains unknown. To investigate the molecular defects underlying PV, we used subtractive hybridization to isolate complementary DNAs (cDNAs) differentially expressed in patients with PV versus normal controls. We isolated a novel gene, subsequently named PRV-1, which is highly expressed in granulocytes from patients with PV (n = 19), but not detectable in normal control granulocytes (n = 21). Moreover, PRV-1 is not expressed in mononuclear cells from patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia (n = 4) or acute myelogenous leukemia (n = 5) or in granulocytes from patients with essential thrombocythemia (n = 4) or secondary erythrocytosis (n = 4). Northern blot analysis showed that PRV-1 is highly expressed in normal human bone marrow and to a much lesser degree in fetal liver. It is not expressed in a variety of other tissues tested. Although PRV-1 is not expressed in resting granulocytes from normal controls, stimulation of these cells with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor induces PRV-1 expression. The PRV-1 cDNA encodes an open reading frame of 437 amino acids, which contains a signal peptide at the N-terminus and a hydrophobic segment at the C-terminus. In addition, PRV-1 contains 2 cysteine-rich domains homologous to those found in the uPAR/Ly6/CD59/snake toxin-receptor superfamily. We therefore propose that PRV-1 represents a novel hematopoietic receptor.

The study evaluated the toxicity of PEG-rHuMGDF and any effect on the duration of thrombocytopenia. Each of 35 patients under 60 years of age received the following therapy: 45 mg/m(2) daunorubicin on days 1-3, 100 mg/m(2) cytarabine (ARA-C) for 7 days, and 2 gm/m(2) high-dose ARA-C (HIDAC) for 6 doses on days 8-10. The 22 patients 60 years or older received standard daunorubicin and ARA-C without HIDAC. PEG-rHuMGDF was well tolerated, and no specific toxicities could be attributed to its use. There was no difference in the time to achieve a platelet count of at least 20 x 10(9)/L among the 3 groups (median 28-30 days for patients less than 60 years old and 21-23 days for patients 60 years or older). Patients receiving PEG-rHuMGDF achieved higher platelet counts after remission. However there was no significant difference in the number of days on which platelet transfusions were administered among the 3 groups. The complete remission rate was 71% for patients less than 60 years and 64% for those 60 years or older, with no significant difference among the 3 groups. Postremission consolidation chemotherapy with either placebo or PEG-rHuMGDF was given to 28 patients beginning the day after completion of chemotherapy. There was no apparent difference in the time that was necessary to reach a platelet count of at least 20 or 50 x 10(9)/L or more platelets or in the number of platelet transfusions received. In summary, PEG-rHuMGDF was well tolerated by patients receiving induction and consolidation therapy for AML; however, there was no effect on the duration of severe thrombocytopenia or the platelet transfusion requirement.

The compounds were evaluated for growth inhibitory activity in a panel of tumor cell lines, including P388 leukemia, Lewis lung carcinoma, and wild-type (JL(C)) and mutant (JL(A) and JL(D)) forms of human Jurkat leukemia. The latter mutant lines are resistant to topoisomerase (topo) II targeted agents because of lower levels of the enzyme. Analogues with small, lipophilic substituents (e.g., Me, Cl) at the 9-position were the most potent inhibitors, superior to the corresponding dimeric bis(acridine-4-carboxamides) (bis-DACA analogues). Several of the compounds were preferentially (up to 2-fold) more cytotoxic toward the mutant Jurkat lines than the wild-type. To test whether this selectivity was related to topoisomerase action, the most potent of the compounds (9-methyl) was evaluated in a cell-free system. It poisoned topo I at drug concentrations of 0.25 and 0.5 microM and inhibited the catalytic activity of both topo I and topo II at concentrations of 1 and 5 microM, respectively. Results from the NCI human tumor cell line panel showed the compounds had preferential activity toward colon tumor lines (on average 9.5-fold more active in the HT29 line than in the cell line panel as a whole). Several analogues produced significant growth delays in the relatively refractory subcutaneous colon 38 tumor model in vivo. In particular, the 9-methyl compound was substantially more potent in this tumor model than the clinical dual topo I/II poison DACA (total dose 90 versus 400 mg/kg) with comparable activity.

Determination Of optimal bioreaction mode and harvest strategy.,213-21,"Although retroviruses are a promising tool for gene therapy, there are two major problems limiting the establishment of viable industrial processes: retrovirus stability and low final yield in the supernatant. This fact emphasizes the need for an effective process optimization, not only at a genetic level but also at a bioprocess engineering level. In part 1 of this paper a mathematical model was developed to optimize the bioreaction yield by determining the best retrovirus harvest strategy in perfusion cultures. PA317 cells producing recombinant retroviruses were used to develop and test this model. Cell culture was performed in stirred tanks using porous supports. The parameters of the proposed model were experimentally determined for batch and perfusion cultures at 32 and 37 degrees C both with and without additives to enhance production; the model was then validated. This model allowed the determination of the optimal values of all operational variables included: batch and perfusion duration and perfusion rate. The highest productivity (2682 virus cm(-)(3) h(-)(1)) was obtained under the following conditions: batch at 37 degrees C for 53 h followed by perfusion at 32 degrees C for 23 h with a perfusion rate of 0.107 h(-)(1). This value was 3.5-fold higher than the best result obtained in batch cultures for the same conditions of titer and quality. A sensitivity analysis of the parameters showed that the parameters that affect most the final productivity depend on the bioreaction phase: cell growth in batch culture and production and product degradation in perfusion culture. In part 2 of this paper, this model is extended to the first step of downstream processing, and the addition of further steps to the process is discussed in order to achieve global process optimization.","['Cruz, P E', 'Almeida, J S', 'Murphy, P N', 'Moreira, J L', 'Carrondo, M J']","['Cruz PE', 'Almeida JS', 'Murphy PN', 'Moreira JL', 'Carrondo MJ']","['Instituto de Biologia Experimental e Tecnologica/Instituto de Tecnologia Quimica e Biologica IBET/ITQB, Apartado 12, P-2780 Oeiras, Instituto de Tecnologia Quimica e Biologica ITQB, Apartado 127, P-2780 Oeiras, Portugal.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Biotechnol Prog,Biotechnology progress,8506292,IM,"['Animals', '*Bioreactors', 'Biotechnology/*methods', 'Butyrates/pharmacology', 'Cell Culture Techniques/methods', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured/virology', 'Dexamethasone/pharmacology', 'Genetic Therapy/methods', 'Half-Life', '*Models, Biological', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/genetics/growth & development', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Retroviridae/genetics/*growth & development', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Temperature']",2000/04/08 09:00,2000/08/06 11:00,['2000/04/08 09:00'],"['2000/04/08 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/08/06 11:00 [medline]', '2000/04/08 09:00 [entrez]']","['bp9901466 [pii]', '10.1021/bp9901466 [doi]']",ppublish,Biotechnol Prog. 2000 Mar-Apr;16(2):213-21. doi: 10.1021/bp9901466.,"['0 (Butyrates)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Maximal increases in activity at 24 h post-irradiation were approximately three times control unirradiated cell levels. These maxima were reached at between 3-5 Gy depending upon cell line. Peak activity was reached at 8h, remained elevated to 24 h and returned to control levels by 48 h. In contrast, X-irradiation did not activate telomerase in a telomerase-negative human fibroblast line, while in cultured normal mouse bone marrow cells irradiation appeared to reduce activities. No simple relationship between radiation-induced increases in telomerase activity in the myeloid leukaemia lines and the proportions of cells in the S or M phases of the cell cycle was apparent. Radiation-induced increases in activity were significantly reduced by inhibitors of transcription (actinomycin D, alpha-amanatin) and protein synthesis (cycloheximide). These data are consistent with two possibilities: (i) X-irradiation leads to increased transcription and/or translation of a component of telomerase, thus increasing activities; or (ii) X-irradiation induces the transcription of a positive regulator of telomerase activity. Northern blot analysis did not indicate that transcription of mTert, the catalytic subunit of telomerase, or mTerc, the RNA component, was elevated after irradiation. Similarly, no significant changes in the expression of Myc or Tnks, the tankyrase gene, two suspected telomerase regulators, were detected. These data are therefore consistent with the induction by X-irradiation of a positive regulator of telomerase activity other than Tnks or Myc or the core protein and RNA components of the enzyme.","['Finnon, P', 'Silver, A R', 'Bouffler, S D']","['Finnon P', 'Silver AR', 'Bouffler SD']","['Radiation Effects Department, National Radiological Protection Board, Chilton, Didcot, Oxon OX11 ORQ, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Carcinogenesis,Carcinogenesis,8008055,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Cycle/radiation effects', 'Cycloheximide/pharmacology', 'DNA-Binding Proteins', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Radiation', 'Enzyme Induction/drug effects', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*enzymology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred CBA', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc/genetics/*physiology', '*RNA', 'Telomerase/antagonists & inhibitors/*biosynthesis/genetics/*physiology', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Up-Regulation', 'X-Rays']",2000/04/07 09:00,2000/06/08 09:00,['2000/04/07 09:00'],"['2000/04/07 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/06/08 09:00 [medline]', '2000/04/07 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/carcin/21.4.573 [doi]'],ppublish,Carcinogenesis. 2000 Apr;21(4):573-8. doi: 10.1093/carcin/21.4.573.,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc)', '0 (telomerase RNA)', '63231-63-0 (RNA)', '98600C0908 (Cycloheximide)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (TERT protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (Telomerase)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (Tert protein, mouse)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The transcription factor Lz (Lozenge), which resembles human AML1 (acute myeloid leukemia- 1) protein, is necessary for the development of crystal cells during embryonic and larval hematopoiesis. Another transcription factor, Gcm (glial cells missing), has previously been shown to be required for plasmatocyte development. Misexpression of Gcm causes crystal cells to be transformed into plasmatocytes. The Drosophila GATA protein Srp (Serpent) is required for both Lz and Gcm expression and is necessary for the development of both classes of hemocytes, whereas Lz and Gcm are required in a lineage-specific manner.

By combining epidemiologic data on the health effects of smoking with risk assessment techniques for low-dose extrapolation, we assessed the proportion of smoking-induced total leukemia and acute myeloid leukemia (AML) attributable to the benzene in cigarette smoke. We fit both linear and quadratic models to data from two benzene-exposed occupational cohorts to estimate the leukemogenic potency of benzene. Using multiple-decrement life tables, we calculated lifetime risks of total leukemia and AML deaths for never, light, and heavy smokers. We repeated these calculations, removing the effect of benzene in cigarettes based on the estimated potencies. From these life tables we determined smoking-attributable risks and benzene-attributable risks. The ratio of the latter to the former constitutes the proportion of smoking-induced cases attributable to benzene. Based on linear potency models, the benzene in cigarette smoke contributed from 8 to 48% of smoking-induced total leukemia deaths [95% upper confidence limit (UCL), 20-66%], and from 12 to 58% of smoking-induced AML deaths (95% UCL, 19-121%). The inclusion of a quadratic term yielded results that were comparable; however, potency models with only quadratic terms resulted in much lower attributable fractions--all < 1%. Thus, benzene is estimated to be responsible for approximately one-tenth to one-half of smoking-induced total leukemia mortality and up to three-fifths of smoking-related AML mortality. In contrast to theoretical arguments that linear models substantially overestimate low-dose risk, linear extrapolations from empirical data over a dose range of 10- to 100-fold resulted in plausible predictions.","['Korte, J E', 'Hertz-Picciotto, I', 'Schulz, M R', 'Ball, L M', 'Duell, E J']","['Korte JE', 'Hertz-Picciotto I', 'Schulz MR', 'Ball LM', 'Duell EJ']","['Department of Epidemiology, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, NC 27599-7400, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Environ Health Perspect,Environmental health perspectives,0330411,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Animals', 'Benzene/*adverse effects', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cohort Studies', 'Dogs', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Leukemia/*etiology/mortality', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*etiology/mortality', 'Life Tables', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Occupational Exposure', 'Risk Assessment', 'Smoking/*adverse effects', 'Tobacco Smoke Pollution/adverse effects/analysis']",2000/04/07 09:00,2000/07/06 11:00,['2000/04/07 09:00'],"['2000/04/07 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/07/06 11:00 [medline]', '2000/04/07 09:00 [entrez]']","['sc271_5_1835 [pii]', '10.1289/ehp.00108333 [doi]']",ppublish,Environ Health Perspect. 2000 Apr;108(4):333-9. doi: 10.1289/ehp.00108333.,"['0 (Tobacco Smoke Pollution)', 'J64922108F (Benzene)']",,PMC1638019,,['P42-ES05948/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The rationale for studying MK expression is based on previous reports showing that it transforms 3T3 cells, and that it acts as an autocrine growth factor in Wilm's tumors, and that its overexpression has been associated with worse outcome in bladder carcinoma. Besides bladder carcinoma, its expression was reported in various solid tumors. We investigated the expression of MK protein and/or MK gene in biopsied specimens from 40 patients with primary malignant lymphoma, 21 with Hodgkin's disease (HD) and 19 with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL). Reed-Sternberg (R-S) cells were stained positive in 10 of 16 HD cases evaluated by immunohistochemical method, whereas 18 of 19 NHL cases did not stain, and one B-cell NHL stained weakly positive. Immunostaining analysis was extended to established cell lines and to normal lymphocytes with or without lectin stimulation or with EB virus transformation. Among hematopoietic cells examined, erythro- or megakaryoblastic leukemia cell lines (K562, MEG-01 and UT7) were positive, while normal lymphocytes (except the EB virus-transformed one) and most myeloid and lymphoid cell lines (except Raji cells) were negative. On the contrary, solid tumor cell lines showed high and strongly positive staining including cell lines derived from of lung gastric, colon, and a pancreatic cancer. Using semi-quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), which is suitable for the detection of weakly expressed mRNA, the relative ratio of MK mRNA to beta-actin mRNA of samples was measured and compared in cases where RNA was available. The mean values of relative ratio (MK/beta-actin) of HD were almost twice as those of NHL samples, peripheral blood T cells, and spleen B cells.

Due to conservation of the reading frame, but depending on the site of the breakpoint in the BCR gene, two alternatively spliced variants of the p210BCR-ABL mRNA (known as b2-a2 and b3-a2) are produced. To investigate whether there are any biological differences between these splice variants we have transfected the b3-a2 or b2-a2 cDNA into a murine myeloid cell line, 32D. We have also included the previously prepared 32Dp210 cell line (which expresses the b3-a2 transcript) in all of our comparisons. RT-PCR analysis indicated that transcription levels were comparable between the variants. Morphological examination of the cells expressing either of the BCR-ABL transcripts indicated that these cells were more mature with increased cytoplasm:nuclear ratios compared to the 32D parental and 32Dneo vector control cells. However, the 32Dp210 cells had a very different appearance from the other panel members and flow karyotyping indicated a clonal evolution and cytogenetic instability in these cells alone. At 10(6) and 10(7) cell doses all 32D cells expressing BCR-ABL caused ill health and tissue infiltration in SCID mice with such rapidity that statistical analysis was not informative. However, at the 10(5) and 10(4) dosage levels there were similar survival rates between mice injected with 32Db2-a2 or 32Db3-a2 while mice injected with 32Dp210 had a significantly shorter survival time. The study of this 32D cell line panel indicated that there were no overt differences in the biological properties conferred by the b3-a2 or b2-a2 transcripts to the 32D cells although these transcripts were able to confer in vitro and in vivo biological effects. This panel of BCR-ABL expressing 32D cells provides a useful model for CML disease progression studies.","['Guinn, B A', 'Evely, R S', 'Walsh, V', 'Gilkes, A F', 'Burnett, A K', 'Mills, K I']","['Guinn BA', 'Evely RS', 'Walsh V', 'Gilkes AF', 'Burnett AK', 'Mills KI']","['Department of Haematology, University of Wales College of Medicine, Cardiff, United Kingdom. barbara.guinn@kcl.ac.uk']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,IM,"['Alternative Splicing/*genetics', 'Animals', 'Cell Division', 'Cell Line/transplantation', 'Cell Movement', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*administration & dosage/*genetics', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology', 'Injections, Intravenous', 'Karyotyping', 'Mice', 'Mice, SCID', 'Protein Isoforms/administration & dosage/genetics', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Transcription, Genetic']",2000/04/07 09:00,2000/08/06 11:00,['2000/04/07 09:00'],"['2000/04/07 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/08/06 11:00 [medline]', '2000/04/07 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.3109/10428190009089440 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2000 Apr;37(3-4):393-404. doi: 10.3109/10428190009089440.,"['0 (Protein Isoforms)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Cytotoxic drugs are mostly used in patients at high risk for thrombotic complications, while their use is still debated in low risk patients because of the risk of leukemia or secondary neoplasm. We discuss the leukemic risk of available treatment strategies in a large cohort of patients. Over a 12 years period we treated 23 patients with busulfan (BU), 1 with pipobroman (Pi), 6 with 32P, 48 with hydroxyurea (HU) in 62 cases associated with acetyl salicylic acid (ASA) while 77 patients received ASA alone and 33 did not receive any therapy. We observed 2 cases of acute leukemia (AL) and 1 of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). One of these patients had been treated with 32P and Pi these after with and the other two with BU and HU. They represented 23% of all patients treated with more than 1 cytotoxic agent, 16.6% of 32P treated subjects, 4% of those with HU and 6.4% of those with BU. The case of MDS occurred in a 81 years old female and represents 4% of cases of ET over the 70 years of age. No cases of AL or MDS were observed in patients not receiving cytotoxic therapy (with or without ASA). According to our experience the use of more than one cytotoxic agent in ET confirms the increase in the risk of leukemia in these cases. However, none of the patients treated with HU alone, even for more than 10 years (12 cases) developed AL. No treatment or therapy with ASA alone may be the best choice in young patients with ET with a low risk of thrombotic complications.","['Randi, M L', 'Fabris, F', 'Girolami, A']","['Randi ML', 'Fabris F', 'Girolami A']","['Department of Medical and Surgical Sciences, University of Padua Medical School, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/*adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Busulfan/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Fatal Outcome', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Hydroxyurea/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Leukemia/*chemically induced', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*chemically induced', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/*chemically induced', 'Phosphorus Radioisotopes/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Pipobroman/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Thrombocythemia, Essential/*drug therapy']",2000/04/07 09:00,2000/08/06 11:00,['2000/04/07 09:00'],"['2000/04/07 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/08/06 11:00 [medline]', '2000/04/07 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.3109/10428190009089438 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2000 Apr;37(3-4):379-85. doi: 10.3109/10428190009089438.,"['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Phosphorus Radioisotopes)', '6Q99RDT97R (Pipobroman)', 'G1LN9045DK (Busulfan)', 'X6Q56QN5QC (Hydroxyurea)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Therefore, we studied TdT expression by flow cytometry in 120 previously untreated patients with AML or myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) to determine the distribution of TdT-positive blasts and the intensity of TdT expression and to seek clinically significant associations. TdT expression measured by flow cytometry (flow TdT%) was heterogeneous, ranging from 0.1% to 87% (median, 8.5%), and 74 patients (62%) had at least 5% TdT-positive blasts. TdT positivity was associated with the M0 or M1 subtype and with expression of CD34 and CD7. No significant correlation was found between TdT expression and type of cytogenetic abnormality or rearrangement of immunoglobulin or T-cell receptor genes. Remission lasted longer in patients with a flow TdT% < 5 than in patients with a flow TdT% > 5 (median, 95 weeks vs 55 weeks, p = 0.02); however, complete remission rates did not differ when patients were classified by initial flow TdT%.

The understanding of these mechanisms could facilitate development of innovative therapeutic approaches. Due to bcr-abl translocation, CML cells carry an intrinsic resistance to apoptotic signals. However, resistance to apoptosis is not absolute and can be overcome through enhancement of immune-mediated pathways, e.g., during graft vs. leukemia reaction after allogeneic bone marrow transplantation, or during interferon-alpha (IFN-alpha) therapy. Among the effector mechanisms, T-lymphocyte-mediated killing of target cells via Fas-receptor (Fas-R) triggering plays an important role in the elimination of malignant cells, including CML cells. Although CML Ph+ progenitor cells express Fas-R, the expression levels are variable and do not correlate with clinical parameters. In addition, CML progenitor cells also express functional Fas-ligand (Fas-L), which may be an important immune surveillance escape factor. IFN-alpha can greatly upmodulate Fas-R expression, an effect that seems to be more pronounced in CML compared to normal cells, while Fas-L expression levels are not affected by IFN-alpha, thereby improving their susceptibility to elimination by the immune system. Responsiveness to Fas-induced apoptosis following stimulation with IFN-alpha correlates with the clinical effects of IFN-alpha therapy. This effect seems to be associated with decreased bcr-abl protein levels, which are influenced by Fas via posttranscriptional modulation. In comparison to the chronic phase, CML cells derived from patients in blast crisis are refractory to Fas-mediated apoptosis, regardless of the expression levels of Fas, suggesting that an immune-mediated selection pressure could result in acquisition of Fas-resistance. In the future, enhancement of immunological recognition and elimination of CML cells may prove to be an effective therapeutic approach directed towards the cure of CML.","['Selleri, C', 'Maciejewski, J P']","['Selleri C', 'Maciejewski JP']","['Division of Hematology, Federico II University of Naples, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*immunology/*pathology', 'fas Receptor/*physiology']",2000/04/07 09:00,2000/08/06 11:00,['2000/04/07 09:00'],"['2000/04/07 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/08/06 11:00 [medline]', '2000/04/07 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.3109/10428190009089429 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2000 Apr;37(3-4):283-97. doi: 10.3109/10428190009089429.,['0 (fas Receptor)'],98,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This paper presents results from a population-based case-control interview study of parents of children less than 15 years of age, which was conducted in the states of West Germany from 1993 to 1997. Cases were 1,184 children with leukemia, 234 with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, and 940 with a solid tumor; 2,588 controls were also included. Parental occupational exposures were found to be related to childhood cancer regardless of the time period of exposure and the type of cancer. This finding might partially be explained by different recall of past exposures by the parents of cases and controls. Residential use of insecticides was associated with childhood lymphoma: both extermination of insects by professional pest controllers (odds ratio (OR) = 2.6, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.2, 5.7) and frequency of parental use of household insecticides (p for trend = 0.02) were significant risk factors for this diagnosis. The use of pesticides on farms was weakly related to childhood leukemia (OR = 1.5, 95% CI: 1.0, 2.2), while their use in gardens was not associated with childhood leukemia (OR = 1.0, 95% CI: 0.8, 1.2). The major strengths of this study were the population base and the large number of cases and controls included; a drawback was assessment of exposure on the basis of parental interviews. The data provide some evidence for an increased leukemia risk for children living on farms and for an association between use of household pesticides and risk of childhood leukemia or lymphoma.","['Meinert, R', 'Schuz, J', 'Kaletsch, U', 'Kaatsch, P', 'Michaelis, J']","['Meinert R', 'Schuz J', 'Kaletsch U', 'Kaatsch P', 'Michaelis J']","['Institute of Medical Statistics and Documentation, Johannes Gutenberg-University of Mainz, Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Am J Epidemiol,American journal of epidemiology,7910653,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Confounding Factors, Epidemiologic', 'Female', 'Germany', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Insecticides/adverse effects', 'Leukemia/*chemically induced', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/*chemically induced', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/chemically induced', 'Occupational Exposure/*adverse effects', 'Odds Ratio', '*Parents', 'Pesticides/*adverse effects', 'Registries', 'Research Design', 'Risk', 'Rural Health/statistics & numerical data', 'Surveys and Questionnaires', 'Urban Health/statistics & numerical data']",2001/02/07 11:00,2001/02/07 11:01,['2001/02/07 11:00'],"['2001/02/07 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/07 11:01 [medline]', '2001/02/07 11:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/oxfordjournals.aje.a010256 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Epidemiol. 2000 Apr 1;151(7):639-46; discussion 647-50. doi: 10.1093/oxfordjournals.aje.a010256.,"['0 (Insecticides)', '0 (Pesticides)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These include bystander effects on non-transduced tumor cells, lower systemic toxicity, and the possibility of inducing immunity against the tumor. Previously we have demonstrated the ability of the grp78 stress-inducible promoter to stimulate expression of reporter genes within the tumor microenvironment. However, experimental evidence demonstrating the ability of this promoter to activate therapeutic agents within the breast cancer environment causing tumor eradication is needed prior to clinical trials. In this report, we test the efficacy of the grp78 promoter in a retroviral system to drive the expression of the HSVtk suicide gene in a murine mammary adenocarcinoma cell line (TSA) in syngeneic, immune-competent hosts. Our results show that under glucose-starvation conditions in vitro, the expression of HSVtk and GCV induced cell death are enhanced in tumor cells in which the HSVtk gene is driven by the internal grp78 promoter compared to cells in which the Moloney murine leukemia virus LTR drives HSVtk. In in vivo studies, in tumors in which the HSVtk gene is driven by the grp78 promoter, GCV treatment causes complete tumor eradication, whereas tumors persist when the HSVtk gene is driven by the retroviral LTR. Our study suggests that the grp78 promoter may be useful to enhance the effectivity of therapeutic agents within a breast tumor. In addition, it is shown that immune memory is induced in syngeneic, immune-competent hosts. This new retroviral vector might therefore be useful for breast cancer gene therapy.","['Chen, X', 'Zhang, D', 'Dennert, G', 'Hung, G', 'Lee, A S']","['Chen X', 'Zhang D', 'Dennert G', 'Hung G', 'Lee AS']","['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, USC/Norris Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of Southlern California Keck School of Medicine, Los Angeles 90089-9176, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Netherlands,Breast Cancer Res Treat,Breast cancer research and treatment,8111104,IM,"['Adenocarcinoma/*genetics/pathology', 'Animals', '*Apoptosis', 'Carrier Proteins/*genetics', 'Endoplasmic Reticulum Chaperone BiP', 'Female', 'Ganciclovir/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Genetic Therapy', 'Glucose/metabolism', '*Heat-Shock Proteins', 'Immunocompetence', 'Mammary Neoplasms, Animal/*genetics/pathology', 'Mice', 'Molecular Chaperones/*genetics', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/*genetics', 'Retroviridae', 'Simplexvirus/*genetics', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2000/04/07 09:00,2000/07/06 11:00,['2000/04/07 09:00'],"['2000/04/07 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/07/06 11:00 [medline]', '2000/04/07 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1023/a:1006398918227 [doi]'],ppublish,Breast Cancer Res Treat. 2000 Jan;59(1):81-90. doi: 10.1023/a:1006398918227.,"['0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Endoplasmic Reticulum Chaperone BiP)', '0 (Heat-Shock Proteins)', '0 (Hspa5 protein, mouse)', '0 (Molecular Chaperones)', 'IY9XDZ35W2 (Glucose)', 'P9G3CKZ4P5 (Ganciclovir)']",,,,"['CA27607/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA59318/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In one approach the genes already shown to be involved in other tumors, such as p53 and Her2neu, were examined. A second approach examined genes detected through genetic screening of families with a high incidence of breast cancer, for example, BRCA-1 and BRCA-2. We used a third approach, subtractive hybridization, to identify and clone genes that were preferentially expressed in breast cancer cells compared to normal mammary epithelium. Instead of analyzing breast cancer cell lines, we examined fresh human breast cancer specimens. By subtracting normal mammary epithelial cDNA from breast cancer cDNA, we were able to clone several genes overexpressed in breast cancer. Two of these genes, L19 and MLN70, were previously reported to be overexpressed in breast cancer. Three of these genes, L19, L34, and MLN70, were localized to a region on chromosome 17 where Her2/neu and BRCA-1 are found. In addition, we isolated a gene we call breast cancer associated gene-1 that was expressed almost exclusively in fresh breast cancer tissue and not in normal mammary epithelium or breast cancer cell lines.

The current study was conducted to investigate the possible mechanism underlying the low myelosuppression. To mimic the clinical situation, peripheral blood progenitor cells collected from 12 patients were used for colony forming unit-granulocyte and monocyte clonogenic assay; and 2 representative modes of 5-fluorouracil exposure (30 min. versus 24 hr) were examined for cytotoxic effects on human myeloid progenitor cells. Previous pharmacokinetic studies have estimated the concentrations of 5-fluorouracil in the bone marrow to be 200-400 microM and 1-2 microM for the 30 min. infusion (600-900 mg/m2) and the 24 hr-infusion (1000-2000 mg/m2) regimens, respectively. The results of our colony-forming unit-granulocyte and monocyte clonogenic assay showed that 24-hr exposure to 5-fluorouracil (2 microM) and 30 min. exposure to 5-fluorouracil (100 microM) resulted in 27.2% and 78.2% inhibition of the colony formation, respectively. Our data provided direct evidence which may explain why myelotoxicity is significantly less in weekly 24 hr infusion of fluorouracil than in the conventional bolus regimens.","['Yeh, K H', 'Yeh, S H', 'Chang, Y S', 'Cheng, A L']","['Yeh KH', 'Yeh SH', 'Chang YS', 'Cheng AL']","['Department of Oncology, National Taiwan University Hospital, Taipei.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Denmark,Pharmacol Toxicol,Pharmacology & toxicology,8702180,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/administration & dosage/*toxicity', 'Breast Neoplasms/blood', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Female', 'Fluorouracil/administration & dosage/*toxicity', 'Granulocytes/*drug effects', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/blood', 'Lymphoma/blood', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Monocytes/*drug effects']",2001/02/07 11:00,2001/02/07 11:01,['2001/02/07 11:00'],"['2001/02/07 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/07 11:01 [medline]', '2001/02/07 11:00 [entrez]']",['10.1034/j.1600-0773.2000.d01-22.x [doi]'],ppublish,Pharmacol Toxicol. 2000 Mar;86(3):122-4. doi: 10.1034/j.1600-0773.2000.d01-22.x.,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', 'U3P01618RT (Fluorouracil)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Among these, the decreased expression of the sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium ATPase (SERCA2) has been described. Elevated levels of cytokines in particular, Leukemia Inhibitory Factor (LIF) and Interleukin-6 (IL-6) have been shown to have the capacity to elicit hypertrophic responses in cultured cardiac myocytes. In this study, we investigated the effects of these cytokines (LIF & IL-6) on the regulation of SERCA2 levels in cardiac myocytes. Cultured neonatal rat ventricular myocytes were transfected with a 3.2 kb promoter plasmid construct containing the SERCA2 promoter linked to a chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) reporter gene, and subsequently treated with 10 ng/ml LIF or 10 ng/ml IL-6. LIF and IL-6 independently caused a significant (p < or = 0.05) 23-36% inhibition in SERCA2 promoter activity. LIF and IL-6 induced inhibition was also evident in SERCA2 mRNA levels as assessed by Northern analysis. Time course of inhibition of SERCA2 mRNA levels showed the most prominent decrease occurring after 48 hours of treatment, with both cytokines having a dose dependent effect on the inhibitory response. Western analysis using a polyclonal antibody to SERCA2 protein indicate a significant, 60% decrease in the amount of total SERCA2 protein in cultured myocytes treated with 10 ng/ml LIF or IL-6. In conclusion, the cytokines LIF and IL-6 downregulate SERCA2 gene expression and protein levels. The molecular mechanism responsible for cytokine induced downregulation of SERCA2 is at least partly transcriptional.","['Villegas, S', 'Villarreal, F J', 'Dillmann, W H']","['Villegas S', 'Villarreal FJ', 'Dillmann WH']","['University of California, San Diego, La Jolla 92103-0618, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Germany,Basic Res Cardiol,Basic research in cardiology,0360342,IM,"['Animals', 'Animals, Newborn', 'Calcium-Transporting ATPases/*physiology', 'Cation Transport Proteins', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Down-Regulation/*physiology', 'Interleukin-6/*physiology', 'Myocardium/*cytology', 'Plasma Membrane Calcium-Transporting ATPases', 'Rats', 'Sarcoplasmic Reticulum/*enzymology']",2000/04/07 09:00,2000/06/08 09:00,['2000/04/07 09:00'],"['2000/04/07 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/06/08 09:00 [medline]', '2000/04/07 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s003950050007 [doi]'],ppublish,Basic Res Cardiol. 2000 Feb;95(1):47-54. doi: 10.1007/s003950050007.,"['0 (Cation Transport Proteins)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', 'EC 3.6.3.8 (Plasma Membrane Calcium-Transporting ATPases)', 'EC 7.2.2.10 (Calcium-Transporting ATPases)']",,,,['HL-25022/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A clinical pathologic and molecular study of 26 patients].,935-44,"BACKGROUND: Adult T cell leukemia lymphoma is a lymphoproliferative syndrome etiologically associated to human T cell lymphotropic virus type I. AIM: To describe the clinical and laboratory features of 26 Caucasian Chilean patients, with HTLV-I positive adult T-cell leukemia lymphoma (ATLL). MATERIAL AND METHODS: Diagnostic criteria included clinical features, cell morphology, immunophenotype, HTLV-I serology and/or DNA analysis by Southern blot or PCR. RESULTS: According to the clinical presentation, 12 cases had the acute ATLL form, 6 had a lymphoma, 4 the chronic form and 4 had smoldering ATLL. The median presentation age was 50 years, younger than the Japanese patients, but significantly older than patients from other South American countries (e.g. Brasil, Jamaica, Colombia). The main clinical features: lymphadenopathy, skin lesions and hepatosplenomegaly, were similar in frequency to those of patients from other countries, except for the high incidence of associated neurological disease. Tropical Spastic Paraparesis (TSP) in our series of ATLL, was seen in one third of the patients (8/26). A T-cell immunophenotype was shown in all 26 cases and HTLV-I serology was positive in 25/26 patients. Molecular analysis on the seronegative patient showed clonal integration of proviral HTLV-I DNA into the lymphocytes DNA, and thus he may have been a poor responder to the retroviral infection. Proviral DNA integration was also demonstrated in 15/16 patients being clonal in 10, polyclonal in 3 (all smoldering cases) and oligoclonal in one. CONCLUSIONS: ATLL in Chile has similar clinical and laboratory features than the disease in other parts of the world, except for a younger age than Japanese patients but older than those from other Latin American countries and a high incidence of patients with associated TSP. Detailed morphological and immunophenotypic analysis of the abnormal circulating lymphocytes, together with the documentation of HTLV-I by serology and/or DNA analysis are key tests for the identification of this disease.","['Cabrera, M E', 'Labra, S', 'Meneses, P', 'Matutes, E', 'Cartier, L', 'Ford, A M', 'Greaves, M F']","['Cabrera ME', 'Labra S', 'Meneses P', 'Matutes E', 'Cartier L', 'Ford AM', 'Greaves MF']","['Seccion Hematologia, Facultad de Medicina, Universidad de Chile, Hospital del Salvador, Santiago de Chile.']",['spa'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Chile,Rev Med Chil,Revista medica de Chile,0404312,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Blotting, Southern', 'Chile', 'Chronic Disease', 'DNA, Viral/analysis', 'Female', 'HTLV-I Antibodies/analysis', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Incidence', '*Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/epidemiology/genetics/immunology/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Prognosis']",2001/02/07 11:00,2001/02/07 11:01,['2001/02/07 11:00'],"['2001/02/07 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/07 11:01 [medline]', '2001/02/07 11:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Rev Med Chil. 1999 Aug;127(8):935-44.,"['0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (HTLV-I Antibodies)']",,,,,,,,Leucemia linfoma T del adulto en Chile.

As part of an international collaborative study devoted to explore the clustering of HTVL-I carriers in different countries, the aim of this paper was to evaluate the seroprevalence of HTLV-I/II virus in the native population of Puna Argentina in Jujuy. Blood samples of individuals of three populations of Puna Jujena (Susques, Rinconada, Cochinoca) were screened with particle agglutination (PA), immunofluorescence (IF) and western immunoblotting analysis (WB) tests. Two out 86 (2.32%) individuals examined in the Puna Jujena showed positive results for HTLV-I antibodies. It is concluded that the Province of Jujuy, in particular its less miscegenated highest altitude areas, constitute the northern and southern Andean natural geographical clustering of HTLV-I. This distribution is probably linked both to a history of prehistoric human dispersal in the Andes and to high mother- to-child transmission of the virus under close conditions of each group.","['Dipierri, J E', 'Tajima, K', 'Cartier Robirosa, L', 'Sonoda, S']","['Dipierri JE', 'Tajima K', 'Cartier Robirosa L', 'Sonoda S']","['Instituto de Biologia de la Altura, Universidad Nacional de Jujuy, Argentina. dipierri@inbial.unju.edu.ar']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Argentina,Medicina (B Aires),Medicina,0204271,IM,"['Adult', 'Argentina/epidemiology', 'Blood Banks', 'Blotting, Western', 'Carrier State/blood/*epidemiology', 'Female', 'HTLV-I Antibodies/*blood', 'HTLV-I Infections/*epidemiology', 'HTLV-II Antibodies/*blood', 'HTLV-II Infections/*epidemiology', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Seroepidemiologic Studies']",2001/02/07 11:00,2001/02/07 11:01,['2001/02/07 11:00'],"['2001/02/07 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/07 11:01 [medline]', '2001/02/07 11:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Medicina (B Aires). 1999;59(6):717-20.,"['0 (HTLV-I Antibodies)', '0 (HTLV-II Antibodies)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Since the enzymes involved in the hydrolysis step of PAF biosynthesis have relative selectivity for arachidonic acid (AA), the fatty acid composition of PAF precursors might modulate PAF production. We studied the effect of AA and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) incorporation on PAF biosynthesis, by measuring the incorporation of [(3)H]acetate, in Ca(2+) ionophore (A23187)-stimulated human leukemic monocyte-like cells, THP-1. Supplementation of THP-1 with AA (25 microM, 1 week) or EPA (25 microM, 1 week) led to their efficient incorporation, in comparable quantities and with similar distributions, into phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylethanolamine, and to a lesser extent into phosphatidylinositol. THP-1 cells supplemented with AA or with EPA synthetized similar amounts of PAF and of acyl analog of PAF under resting condition. However, AA-supplemented cells responded to A23187 stimulation by important raises of PAF (+125.71%) and of acyl analog of PAF (+381.75%) productions, whereas the same stimulation had little effect or no effect at all in cells supplemented with EPA. These results show that both EPA and AA may influence PAF production through their incorporation into PAF precursors, indicating that PAF production might be modulated by the fatty acid composition of its precursors.","['Martin-Chouly, C A', 'Menier, V', 'Hichami, A', 'Youmine, H', 'Noel, F', 'Pedrono, F', 'Legrand, A B']","['Martin-Chouly CA', 'Menier V', 'Hichami A', 'Youmine H', 'Noel F', 'Pedrono F', 'Legrand AB']","['Laboratoire de Pharmacologie Moleculaire, Faculte de Pharmacie, Universite de Rennes I, 2 Avenue du Pr Leon Bernard, 35043, Rennes, France. corinne.chouly@univ-rennes1.fr']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Prostaglandins Other Lipid Mediat,Prostaglandins & other lipid mediators,9808648,IM,"['Acetates/metabolism', 'Arachidonic Acid/*metabolism', 'Calcimycin/pharmacology', 'Eicosapentaenoic Acid/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Ionophores/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Monocytic, Acute', 'Phospholipids/*metabolism', 'Platelet Activating Factor/*biosynthesis', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2001/02/07 11:00,2001/02/07 11:01,['2001/02/07 11:00'],"['2001/02/07 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/07 11:01 [medline]', '2001/02/07 11:00 [entrez]']","['S0090698099000581 [pii]', '10.1016/s0090-6980(99)00058-1 [doi]']",ppublish,Prostaglandins Other Lipid Mediat. 2000 Mar;60(4-6):127-35. doi: 10.1016/s0090-6980(99)00058-1.,"['0 (Acetates)', '0 (Ionophores)', '0 (Phospholipids)', '0 (Platelet Activating Factor)', '27YG812J1I (Arachidonic Acid)', '37H9VM9WZL (Calcimycin)', 'AAN7QOV9EA (Eicosapentaenoic Acid)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Biochemistry 36, 9429-9437). Also, 1alpha,23(S),25(OH)(3)-24-oxo-D(3) has been shown to possess only weak in vivo calcemic actions. Thus, vitamin D(3) analogs structurally related to 1alpha,23(S),25(OH)(3)-24-oxo-D(3) may have therapeutic value. Furthermore, biologic activity studies of various synthetic analogs of 1alpha,25(OH)(2)D(3) showed that the removal of carbon-19 (C-19) reduces the calcemic activity of 1alpha, 25(OH)(2)D(3.) Therefore, in an attempt to produce vitamin D(3) analogs with a better therapeutic index, we synthesized C(23) epimers of 1alpha,23,25(OH)(3)-24-oxo-19-nor-vitamin D(3) [1alpha,23, 25(OH)(3)-24-oxo-19-nor-D(3)]. The two epimers were compared to 1alpha,25(OH)(2)-19-nor-D(3) and 1alpha,25(OH)(2)D(3) in their ability to generate biologic activities in several in vitro assay systems. In the assay measuring the suppression of parathyroid hormone (PTH) secretion in bovine parathyroid cells, 1alpha,23(S), 25(OH)(3)-24-oxo-19-nor-D(3) was as potent as 1alpha, 25(OH)(2)-19-nor-D(3) but was less potent than 1alpha,25(OH)(2)D(3). In the same assay 1alpha,23(R),25(OH)(3)-24-oxo-19-nor-D(3) exhibited greater potency than 1alpha,23(S), 25(OH)(3)-24-oxo-19-nor-D(3). In the assays measuring the ability of vitamin D compounds to inhibit clonal growth and to induce differentiation of human promyelocytic leukemia (HL-60) cells, 1alpha,23(S),25(OH)(3)-24-oxo-19-nor-D(3) was less potent than 1alpha,25(OH)(2)-19-nor-D(3) but was equipotent to 1alpha, 25(OH)(2)D(3). More importantly, in the same assays, 1alpha,23(R), 25(OH)(3)-24-oxo-19-nor-D(3) was more potent than 1alpha,23(S), 25(OH)(3)-24-oxo-19-nor-D(3) and was equipotent to 1alpha, 25(OH)(2)-19-nor-D(3). Also, the vitamin D receptor-mediated transcriptional activity of 1alpha,23(R), 25(OH)(3)-24-oxo-19-nor-D(3) was almost equal to that of 1alpha, 25(OH)(2)-19-nor-D(3), but higher than that of 1alpha,23(S), 25(OH)(3)-24-oxo-19-nor-D(3).

The cells were isolated by density gradient centrifugation from peripheral blood of patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and from healthy study subjects. The cytotoxicity of UV irradiation was determined in vitro in peripheral blood mononuclear lymphocytes from 36 CLL patients and from eight healthy donors using the incorporation of radioactive leucine in 4-day cultures. A remarkable difference in excision repair capability was observed between normal and leukemic lymphocytes. In contrast to normal lymphocytes, there was always a subpopulation of CLL cells that did not complete the repair of UV-induced DNA damage during the 24-h repair period. Furthermore, differences were also recorded between UV-sensitive and UV-resistant CLL cases. The differences in DNA migration between the maximum increase (59-77 microm) and that at 24 h after irradiation (21-66 microm) was statistically significant in two of three patients exhibiting UV-resistance. Correspondingly, only in one of three patients exhibiting UV-sensitivity was the difference in DNA migration statistically significant (maximum increase: 44-107 microm, vs. 24 h after: 42-100 microm). Our results confirm an abnormal pattern of the CLL cell response to UV irradiation. Furthermore, we identified defective processing of UV-induced DNA damage in CLL versus normal lymphocytes, particularly in UV-sensitive cases.","['Myllyperkio, M H', 'Koski, T R', 'Vilpo, L M', 'Vilpo, J A']","['Myllyperkio MH', 'Koski TR', 'Vilpo LM', 'Vilpo JA']","['Laboratory of Molecular Hematology, Department of Clinical Chemistry, Tampere University Hospital, P.O.

METHODS: A total of 6000 cases of hematologic malignancies from our hospital and near regions in China were investigated between October 1985 and November 1998. Chromosome preparations were made on bone marrow cells by using direct method and/or unstimulated short-term cultures. Karyotypes were analyzed by R-banding technique and expressed according to ISCN(1995). RESULTS: 11q23 abnormalities were found in 28 of 6000 cases with hematologic malignancies(0.47%). It may be separated into seven cytonetic categories: t(4;11)(q21;q23)(ten cases), t(11;19)(q23;p13)(five cases), t(9;11)(p12;q23)(two cases), t(10;11)(p15;q23)(two cases), t(6;11)(q27;q23) (one case), del(11)(q23)(seven cases), and t(11;?)(q23;?)(one case). The diagnoses included acute myeloid leukemia in 14 cases (M(2a), three; M(4), two; M(5a), one; M(5b), eight), acute lymphoblastic leukemia(ALL) in 10 cases, myelodysplastic syndrome in three cases and malignant histiocytosis in one case. All 10 cases with t(4;11) anomaly were ALL. Follow-up data were available for 22 of them. Their median survival was 113 days. The patients may be grouped according to the presence or absence of additional abnormalities and/or normal karyotype. The median survival was 75 days for five patients with 11q23 anomaly only, 18 days for two patients with 11q23 and additional abnormalities, 135 days for 10 patients with 11q23 anomaly, additional abnormalities and normal karyotype, and 150 days for 5 patients with 11q23 anomaly and normal karyotype. CONCLUSION: 11q23 abnormalities were mainly seen in ALL and acute monocytic leukemia. Their prognosis was very poor. Both additional abnormalities and lack of normal karyotype had adverse effects on the survival of patients.

Cytokine inhibition of SERCA2 transcriptional activity was also evident when a 0.6-kb SERCA2 mutant, T(3)-unresponsive promoter construct was used. Treatment with T(3) and cytokines showed a significant decrease in transcription when a reporter construct was used that was comprised of direct repeats of SERCA2 thyroid response element I.

The lack of genetic determination implicates environmental factors in this selection and specification process. We analysed, in organotypic visual cortex cultures, the specification of neurons expressing neuropeptide Y (NPY), a potent anticonvulsant. Endogenous brain-derived neurotrophic factor and neurotrophin 4/5 play no role in early NPY phenotype specification. Rather, the decision to express NPY is made during a period of molecular plasticity during which differentiating neurons with the potential to express NPY compete for the cytokine leukemia inhibitory factor which is produced in the cortex, but is negatively regulated by thalamic afferences. The neurons that fail in this competition are parvalbuminergic basket and chandelier neurons, which express NPY transiently, but will not acquire a permanent NPY expression. They switch into a facultative NPY expression mode, and remain responsive to the neurotrophins which modulate NPY expression later in development.","['Wahle, P', 'Gorba, T', 'Wirth, M J', 'Obst-Pernberg, K']","['Wahle P', 'Gorba T', 'Wirth MJ', 'Obst-Pernberg K']","['AG Entwicklungsneurobiologie, Ruhr-Universitat, ND 7/31, Germany. wahle@neurobiologie.ruhr-uni-bochum.de']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Development,"Development (Cambridge, England)",8701744,IM,"['Animals', 'Biolistics', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental', 'Growth Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'In Situ Hybridization', '*Interleukin-6', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor Receptor alpha Subunit', 'Lymphokines/*pharmacology', 'Neurons/classification/*metabolism', 'Neuropeptide Y/*metabolism', 'Phenotype', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Rats', 'Rats, Long-Evans', 'Receptor, trkB/metabolism', 'Receptors, Cytokine/metabolism', 'Receptors, OSM-LIF', 'Transfection', 'Visual Cortex/*cytology']",2000/04/06 09:00,2000/06/17 09:00,['2000/04/06 09:00'],"['2000/04/06 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/06/17 09:00 [medline]', '2000/04/06 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Development. 2000 May;127(9):1943-51.,"['0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor Receptor alpha Subunit)', '0 (Lifr protein, rat)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Neuropeptide Y)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Cytokine)', '0 (Receptors, OSM-LIF)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor, trkB)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

MDS has been recognized as a stem-cell disease, and hemopoietic stem-cell transplantation is currently the only potentially curative therapy. In patients with less advanced MDS (<5% blasts in the marrow), 3-year survival rates of 70% and 65% can be achieved with HLA-identical related and HLA-matched unrelated donors, respectively. The overall probability of disease recurrence in these patients is less than 5%. Of patients with advanced disease (5% marrow blasts or more), about 40% to 45% and 25% to 30% are surviving in remission after transplantation from a related or an unrelated donor, respectively. This inferior outcome is largely due to a higher incidence of post-transplantation relapse (20% to 30%). Inclusion of the International Prognostic Scoring System criteria into outcome analyses shows an inverse correlation between overall risk category and relapse-free survival after transplantation. Future trials should explore the usefulness of different transplantation regimens for different risk categories. Among patients with less advanced disease, use of a conditioning regimen that combines cyclophosphamide and busulfan, dose adjusted to reach target plasma levels, has been associated with improved survival in recipients of transplants from related and unrelated donors. It has also permitted successful hemopoietic stem-cell transplantation in patients as old as 66 years of age. Improved survival with transplants from unrelated volunteer donors has been achieved with selection of donors based on high-resolution HLA typing. Autologous stem-cell transplantation may provide excellent consolidation for selected patients who have obtained complete remission with conventional chemotherapy. High treatment-related morbidity and mortality rates, particularly after allogeneic transplantation, remain challenges that must be addressed with innovative approaches.","['Deeg, H J', 'Appelbaum, F R']","['Deeg HJ', 'Appelbaum FR']","['Clinical Research Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, Washington 98109-1024, USA. jdeeg@fhcrc.org']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",United States,Curr Opin Oncol,Current opinion in oncology,9007265,IM,"['Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*therapy', 'Prognosis', 'Transplantation, Autologous', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",2000/04/06 09:00,2000/05/20 09:00,['2000/04/06 09:00'],"['2000/04/06 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/05/20 09:00 [medline]', '2000/04/06 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/00001622-200003000-00003 [doi]'],ppublish,Curr Opin Oncol. 2000 Mar;12(2):116-20. doi: 10.1097/00001622-200003000-00003.,,31,,,"['CA15704/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA18029/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL36444/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These efforts have been able, more precisely, to quantitate the degree to which patients who receive transplantation are a selected group. There has been a trend in recent years to increase the intensity of chemotherapy, which has improved treatment results, and the factors which determine the risk of relapse have become more widely acknowledged. These developments have made the appropriate choice of consolidation treatment less clear. Transplantation significantly reduces the risk of relapse and in some trials has improved the disease-free survival. However, a clear benefit in overall survival has been less clear and more difficult to demonstrate, partly because some patients who fail first-line chemotherapy can be salvaged in second remission.

METHODS: One hundred twenty-five consecutive patients who underwent bone marrow transplantation (BMT) at the Leiden University Medical Centre between 1987 and 1992 filled in questionnaires measuring quality of life, functional limitations, psychological distress, anxiety, depression, self-esteem, and health locus of control. Measurements were taken before the BMT; 1 month after discharge; and 6 months, 1 year, and 3 years after the BMT. RESULTS: Three years after BMT, a quarter of the patients continued to experience serious functional limitations. Thirteen percent of the patients scored >4 on the General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12), a percentage comparable to general population prevalence. Quality of life was reported to be good to excellent by almost 90% of the patients at three years. Changes in quality of life could be explained entirely by changes in functional limitations and somatic symptoms. Changes in psychological distress were also related to these measures, and furthermore to baseline psychological functioning. CONCLUSION: Although patients were doing well three years after BMT, there was a group of patients needing help. In interventions special attention should be given to patients with ongoing psychological problems. Emphasis should be on coping with physical limitations.","['Broers, S', 'Kaptein, A A', 'Le Cessie, S', 'Fibbe, W', 'Hengeveld, M W']","['Broers S', 'Kaptein AA', 'Le Cessie S', 'Fibbe W', 'Hengeveld MW']","['Department of Psychiatry, Leiden University Medical Centre, Oegstgeest, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",England,J Psychosom Res,Journal of psychosomatic research,0376333,IM,"['*Adaptation, Psychological', 'Adult', 'Analysis of Variance', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/*psychology', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', '*Health Status', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/psychology', 'Lymphoma/psychology', 'Male', 'Netherlands', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/psychology', 'Prospective Studies', 'Quality of Life/*psychology', 'Stress, Psychological/*psychology', 'Survival Analysis']",2000/04/06 09:00,2000/04/29 09:00,['2000/04/06 09:00'],"['2000/04/06 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/04/29 09:00 [medline]', '2000/04/06 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0022-3999(99)00059-8 [pii]', '10.1016/s0022-3999(99)00059-8 [doi]']",ppublish,J Psychosom Res. 2000 Jan;48(1):11-21. doi: 10.1016/s0022-3999(99)00059-8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: We reviewed the medical records of patients with Ph-positive ALL who were treated with intensive chemotherapy, with or without bone marrow transplantation, by 10 study groups or large single institutions from 1986 to 1996. Data on 326 children and young adults, who ranged in age from 0.4 to 19.9 years (median, 8.1), were analyzed to determine the rate of complete remission and the probability of event-free, disease-free and overall survival according to standard prognostic factors and type of treatment. RESULTS: The 267 patients who achieved a complete remission after induction chemotherapy (82 percent) were stratified into three subgroups according to the age and leukocyte count at the time of diagnosis: those with the best prognosis (a leukocyte count of less than 50,000 per cubic millimeter and an age of less than 10 years; 95 patients); those with an intermediate prognosis (intermediate-risk features; 92 patients); and those with the worst prognosis (a leukocyte count of more than 100,000 per cubic millimeter; 80 patients). The estimates of disease-free survival at five years (+/-SE) were 49+/-5 percent) for patients with the best prognosis), 30+/-5 percent (for those with an intermediate prognosis), and 20+/-5 percent (for those with the worst prognosis) (P<0.001 for the overall comparison). We also found that transplantation of bone marrow from an HLA-matched related donor offered significantly greater benefit than intensive chemotherapy alone in terms of protecting patients from relapse or other adverse events (relative risk, 0.3; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.2 to 0.5; P<0.001). This finding was consistent in all three groups. CONCLUSIONS: Unlike the usual type of all, Ph-positive ALL is associated with a poor prognosis. Nevertheless, in some patients with favorable prognosis features, the disease can be be controlled by intensive chemotherapy. Transplantation of bone marrow from an HLA-matched related donor is superior to other types of transplantation and to intensive chemotherapy alone in prolonging initial complete remissions.","['Arico, M', 'Valsecchi, M G', 'Camitta, B', 'Schrappe, M', 'Chessells, J', 'Baruchel, A', 'Gaynon, P', 'Silverman, L', 'Janka-Schaub, G', 'Kamps, W', 'Pui, C H', 'Masera, G']","['Arico M', 'Valsecchi MG', 'Camitta B', 'Schrappe M', 'Chessells J', 'Baruchel A', 'Gaynon P', 'Silverman L', 'Janka-Schaub G', 'Kamps W', 'Pui CH', 'Masera G']","['Department of Pediatrics, Instituto Ricovero e Cura a Carattere Scientifico, Policlinico San Matteo, Pavia, Italy. aricom@unipv.it']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,N Engl J Med,The New England journal of medicine,0255562,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/mortality/therapy', 'Prognosis', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'Remission Induction', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Analysis', 'Treatment Outcome']",2000/04/06 00:00,2000/04/11 00:00,['2000/04/06 00:00'],"['2000/04/06 00:00 [pubmed]', '2000/04/11 00:00 [medline]', '2000/04/06 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1056/NEJM200004063421402 [doi]'],ppublish,N Engl J Med. 2000 Apr 6;342(14):998-1006. doi: 10.1056/NEJM200004063421402.,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],,,,"['E.0755/Telethon/Italy', 'CA 36401/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 51001/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA21765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['N Engl J Med. 2000 Oct 5;343(14):1043; author reply 1043-4.

Relevant to this observation, we found that the trans-sialidase (TS) of Trypanosoma cruzi, the etiologic agent of Chagas' disease, induces neurite outgrowth and rescues PC12 cells from apoptotic death caused by growth factor deprivation. These properties, novel for a parasite protein, were independent of catalytic activity and were mapped to the C terminus of the catalytic domain of TS. TS activated protein kinase Akt in a phosphoinositide-3 kinase-inhibitable manner, suggesting a molecular mechanism for the TS-induced neuroprotection. TS also triggered bcl-2 gene expression in growth factor-deprived cells, an effect consistent with TS protecting against apoptosis. Ciliary neurotrophic factor and leukemia inhibitory factor, two cytokines critical to the repair of injured motor neurons, specifically potentiated the TS action.

The cytokine leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) provides a tractable experimental system to investigate this problem, because translation of alternatively spliced transcripts results in the production of differentially localized LIF proteins, one secreted from the cell and acting via cell surface receptors and the other localized within the cell. We have used overexpression analysis to demonstrate that extracellular and intracellular LIF proteins can have distinct cellular activities. Intracellular LIF protein is localized to both nucleus and cytoplasm and when overexpressed induces apoptosis that is inhibited by CrmA but not Bcl-2 expression. Mutational analysis revealed that the intracellular activity was independent of receptor interaction and activation and reliant on a conserved leucine-rich motif that was not required for activation of cell surface receptors by extracellular protein. This provides the first report of alternate intracellular and extracellular cytokine activities that result from differential cellular localization of the protein and are mediated by spatially distinct motifs.","['Haines, B P', 'Voyle, R B', 'Rathjen, P D']","['Haines BP', 'Voyle RB', 'Rathjen PD']","['Department of Biochemistry, University of Adelaide, Adelaide, South Australia 5005, Australia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Mol Biol Cell,Molecular biology of the cell,9201390,IM,"['Amino Acid Motifs', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Apoptosis/physiology', 'COS Cells', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Nucleus/metabolism', 'Cytoplasm/metabolism', 'Extracellular Space/metabolism', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Growth Inhibitors/chemistry/*metabolism', '*Interleukin-6', 'Leucine/chemistry', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Lymphokines/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'Receptors, Cell Surface/physiology', 'Sequence Analysis, Protein', 'Serpins/metabolism', 'Transfection', '*Viral Proteins']",2000/04/06 09:00,2000/07/15 11:00,['2000/04/06 09:00'],"['2000/04/06 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/07/15 11:00 [medline]', '2000/04/06 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1091/mbc.11.4.1369 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Biol Cell. 2000 Apr;11(4):1369-83. doi: 10.1091/mbc.11.4.1369.,"['0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Receptors, Cell Surface)', '0 (Serpins)', '0 (Viral Proteins)', '96282-35-8 (interleukin-1beta-converting enzyme inhibitor)', 'GMW67QNF9C (Leucine)']",,PMC14853,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Another lymphoid cultures (MT-4, CEM, CEM-ss, AdCEM) similarly treated were infected with either HIV-1/RF or IIIB. Specificity of HIV-1 was compared to the effects of vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV). Unlike other cultures, HIV-1/RF infected C8166 cells in Eagle s MEM exhibited surface projections resembling hairy leukemia cells, which was followed by balloon degeneration and apoptosis. Immobilized HIV-1 infected cultures formed flat syncytia with several interdigitating dendritic projections. Syncytia shrunk with condensed nuclear material and axon-like filaments characteristic for infected macrophages. VSV induced enlargement and necrotic lysis of all cell types. Early postinfection with HIV-1, electron microscopy revealed irreversible membrane fusion above cell nuclei, and transient fusion between filaments. Transient presence of coated vesicles containing intact HIV-1 particles, Birbeck granule-like structures of Langerhans cells, fibrillar-lamellar structures resembling hairy leukemia or Sezary cells were detected.

Perkins et al., Cancer Res., 58: 4561-4566, 1998). In this report, we demonstrate that in HL-60/Apaf-1 cells, the activity of caspase-9 and -3 induced by Apaf-1 overexpression was associated with a significant increase (5-fold) in the cytosolic accumulation of cytochrome c (cyt c), loss of mitochondrial membrane potential (deltapsim), and an increase in the reactive oxygen species. These were also associated with the processing of procaspase-8 and Bid (cytosolic, proapoptotic BH3 domain containing protein). Transient transfection of Apaf-1 into the Apaf-1-containing mouse embryogenic fibroblasts (MEFs; Apaf-1+/- MEFs) or Apaf-1-/- MEFs also induced the processing of procaspase-9 and procaspase-8, Bid cleavage, and apoptosis. These events were secondary to the activity of the downstream caspases induced by Apaf-1. This conclusion is supported by the observation that in HL-60/Apaf-1 cells, ectopic expression of dominant negative caspase-9, its inhibitory short isoform caspase-9b, or XIAP or treatment with the caspase inhibitor zVAD (50 microM) inhibited Apaf-1-induced caspase-8 and Bid cleavage, mitochondrial deltapsim, release of cyt c, and apoptosis. In contrast, a transient transfection of dominant negative caspase-8 or CrmA or exposure to caspase-8 inhibitor zIETD-fmk inhibited the processing of procaspase-8 and Bid but did not inhibit the cytosolic accumulation of cyt c in either the untreated HL-60/Apaf-1 cells or the etoposide-treated HL-60/Apaf-1 and HL-60/neo cells. These results indicate that Apaf-1 overexpression lowers the apoptotic threshold by activating caspase-9 and caspase-3. This triggers the mitochondrial deltapsim and cyt c release into the cytosol through a predominant mechanism other than cleavage of caspase-8 and/or Bid. This mechanism may involve a cytosolic mitochondrial permeability transition factor, which may be processed and activated by the downstream effector caspases, thereby completing an amplifying feedback loop, which triggers the mitochondrial events during apoptosis.","['Perkins, C L', 'Fang, G', 'Kim, C N', 'Bhalla, K N']","['Perkins CL', 'Fang G', 'Kim CN', 'Bhalla KN']","['Division of Clinical and Translational Research, Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of Miami School of Medicine, Florida 33136, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects/genetics', 'Apoptotic Protease-Activating Factor 1', 'BH3 Interacting Domain Death Agonist Protein', 'Carrier Proteins/metabolism/physiology', 'Caspase 3', 'Caspase 8', 'Caspase 9', 'Caspases/metabolism/physiology', 'Cytochrome c Group/drug effects/metabolism', 'Cytosol/drug effects/metabolism', 'Enzyme Precursors/metabolism', 'Etoposide/*pharmacology', 'Fibroblasts/cytology/drug effects/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'HL-60 Cells/cytology/drug effects/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Intracellular Membranes/drug effects/physiology', 'Membrane Potentials/drug effects', 'Mice', 'Mitochondria/*drug effects/metabolism/physiology', 'Paclitaxel/*pharmacology', 'Proteins/genetics/*physiology', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/genetics/physiology']",2000/04/05 09:00,2000/05/08 09:00,['2000/04/05 09:00'],"['2000/04/05 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/05/08 09:00 [medline]', '2000/04/05 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 2000 Mar 15;60(6):1645-53.,"['0 (APAF1 protein, human)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Apaf1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Apoptotic Protease-Activating Factor 1)', '0 (BH3 Interacting Domain Death Agonist Protein)', '0 (BID protein, human)', '0 (Bid protein, mouse)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Cytochrome c Group)', '0 (Enzyme Precursors)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP8 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP9 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Casp3 protein, mouse)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Casp8 protein, mouse)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Casp9 protein, mouse)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 8)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 9)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'P88XT4IS4D (Paclitaxel)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This suggests a positive effect of sodium ions on such restoration capacity. Stability was high in different diluents used as parenteral solutions and in recipients used in medical practice without significant loss of activity for at least 7 days. These results lead us to conclude that the enzyme has a high stability after the lyophilized form has been reconstituted (at least 7 days), since the necessary precautions are taken in terms of sterile manipulation and if it is stored in a suitable parenteral vehicle under low temperature (about 8 degrees C).","['Stecher, A L', 'de Deus, P M', 'Polikarpov, I', 'Abrahao-Neto, J']","['Stecher AL', 'de Deus PM', 'Polikarpov I', 'Abrahao-Neto J']","['Department of Biochemical and Pharmaceutical Technology, Pharmaceutical Sciences School, University of Sao Paulo, Brazil.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Switzerland,Pharm Acta Helv,Pharmaceutica acta Helvetiae,0401134,IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*chemistry', 'Asparaginase/*chemistry', 'Enzyme Stability', 'Humans', 'Hydrogen-Ion Concentration', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy']",2000/04/05 09:00,2000/04/25 09:00,['2000/04/05 09:00'],"['2000/04/05 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/04/25 09:00 [medline]', '2000/04/05 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0031686599000096 [pii]', '10.1016/s0031-6865(99)00009-6 [doi]']",ppublish,Pharm Acta Helv. 1999 Dec;74(1):1-9. doi: 10.1016/s0031-6865(99)00009-6.,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', 'EC 3.5.1.1 (Asparaginase)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Dual-color fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) assay using two probes (BAC92 and YAC412A4) convincingly demonstrated that the chromosomal material from 8q was translocated onto 19q rather than 19p in case 2. Thus, we consider t(8;19)(q22;q13) a true ""simple"" variant of t(8;21), and assume that a fusion gene resulting from the t(8;19) may contain the ETO gene located at 8q22 and an unknown partner gene from 19q13, which probably is a new transcription factor, whose molecular entity warrants further study.","['Xue, Y', 'Niu, C', 'Chen, S', 'Wang, Y', 'Guo, Y', 'Xie, X', 'Lu, D', 'Li, P']","['Xue Y', 'Niu C', 'Chen S', 'Wang Y', 'Guo Y', 'Xie X', 'Lu D', 'Li P']","[""Jiangsu Institute of Hematology, Leukemia Research Unit, First Affiliated Hospital of Suzhou Medical College, Suzhou, People's Republic of China.""]",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",United States,Cancer Genet Cytogenet,Cancer genetics and cytogenetics,7909240,IM,"['Adolescent', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 19', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 8', 'Female', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Translocation, Genetic']",2000/04/05 09:00,2000/05/08 09:00,['2000/04/05 09:00'],"['2000/04/05 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/05/08 09:00 [medline]', '2000/04/05 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0165-4608(99)00185-5 [pii]', '10.1016/s0165-4608(99)00185-5 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Genet Cytogenet. 2000 Apr 15;118(2):154-8. doi: 10.1016/s0165-4608(99)00185-5.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Proper assignment of chromosome number or aberration or both can be difficult. Specific identification of chromosomal abnormalities aids in the diagnosis and selection of treatment of patients. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) has been applied to the identification of translocations, markers, and other chromosomal abnormalities in clinical cytogenetics. However, the standard FISH technique is unable to detect the entire genome in a single experiment. This report presents the use of a cross-species comparative genomic hybridization color-banding technique (RxFISH) that permits examination of an entire karyotype at one time. Specimens from two patients, one with acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) and the other with multiple myeloma (MM), were studied. Metaphases were prepared by standard culture techniques. Conventional cytogenetic analysis (GTG banding) showed multiple clones in each of the cases. These clones were hyperdiploid metaphases with complex chromosomal abnormalities and multiple markers. The slides were then hybridized with FITC-, Cy-3-, and Cy-5-labeled RxFISH probes; the results were analyzed by a digital imaging system. The RxFISH color banding confirmed the hyperdiploid metaphases and identified multiple chromosomal abnormalities. In the specimen from the patient with ALL, several chromosomes, which had been classified as markers by G-banding, were found to be specific chromosomes. This study suggests that RxFISH can provide more accurate and specific identification of complex chromosomal abnormalities.

Relatively little is known about the structure of CBP, but it has been noted that it contains three domains that are rich in cysteine and histidine (CH1, CH2, and CH3). The sequence of CH2 conforms to that of a leukemia-associated protein domain (PHD finger), and it has been postulated that this and both CH1 and CH3 may be zinc finger domains. This has not, however, been demonstrated experimentally. We have studied CH1 and show that it is composed of two novel zinc-binding modules, which we term ""zinc bundles."" Each bundle contains the sequence Cys-X(4)-Cys-X(8)-His-X(3)-Cys, and we show that a synthetic peptide comprising one zinc bundle from CH1 can fold in a zinc-dependent manner. CH3 also appears to contain two zinc bundles, one with the variant sequence Cys-X(2)-Cys-X(9)-His-X(3)-Cys, and we demonstrate that this variant motif also undergoes Zn(II)-induced folding. CH1 acts as a transcriptional activation domain in cellular assays. We show that mutations in any of the four zinc-chelating residues in either zinc bundle of CH1 significantly impair this activity and that these mutations also interfere with certain protein-protein interactions mediated by CH1. Our results indicate that CBP is a genuine zinc-binding protein and introduce zinc bundles as novel protein interaction domains.","['Newton, A L', 'Sharpe, B K', 'Kwan, A', 'Mackay, J P', 'Crossley, M']","['Newton AL', 'Sharpe BK', 'Kwan A', 'Mackay JP', 'Crossley M']","['Department of Biochemistry, G08, University of Sydney, Sydney, New South Wales 2006, Australia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Arabidopsis', 'Binding Sites', 'CREB-Binding Protein', 'Caenorhabditis elegans', 'Circular Dichroism', 'Cysteine', 'Drosophila melanogaster', 'Histidine', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Nuclear Proteins/*chemistry/metabolism', 'Plants, Toxic', 'Protein Folding', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid', 'Tobacco', 'Trans-Activators/*chemistry/metabolism', 'Transcriptional Activation', 'Zinc/metabolism', 'Zinc Fingers']",2000/04/05 09:00,2000/06/24 11:00,['2000/04/05 09:00'],"['2000/04/05 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/06/24 11:00 [medline]', '2000/04/05 09:00 [entrez]']","['10.1074/jbc.M910396199 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(19)80495-7 [pii]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2000 May 19;275(20):15128-34. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M910396199.,"['0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '4QD397987E (Histidine)', 'EC 2.3.1.48 (CREB-Binding Protein)', 'EC 2.3.1.48 (CREBBP protein, human)', 'EC 2.3.1.48 (Crebbp protein, mouse)', 'J41CSQ7QDS (Zinc)', 'K848JZ4886 (Cysteine)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

DNA binding assays and cell transfection experiments revealed that the bipartite core sequence of FPB (5'-ATCAATCA-3') binds the PBX1/2, PREP1, and HOXB1 proteins, and this in turn leads to promoter transactivation. In the presence of all three nuclear factors, cooperative interactions between recombinant PBX1 and PREP1 or PBX1 and HOXB1 result in binding of the heterodimers to FPB in vitro. Similarly, overexpression of different combinations of PBX1, PREP1, and HOXB1 transactivates FPB-driven transcription. In contrast to the composition of the FPB complex purified from COL5A2-positive cells, the FPB complex from COL5A2-negative cells contains PBX2 and PREP1 but lacks PBX1. However, PBX1 exogenously introduced into COL5A2-negative cells cannot stimulate FPB-driven transcription unless co-expressed with PREP1.

This process involves functional cross-talk of Smads with transcription factors at responsive DNA elements to achieve maximal transcription activation and specificity. TGF-beta has been shown to induce transcription of the germ line (GL) Ig alpha constant region gene and to direct class switching to IgA antibodies. It has been shown that acute myeloid leukemia (AML) transcription factors cooperate with Smad3 to stimulate transcription from the GL Ig alpha constant region gene promoter. We report here that the TGF-beta-induced transcription from this promoter requires DNA binding of cAMP-response element-binding protein (CREB) to the nearby ATF/cAMP-response element site and of Smads to a nearby Smad binding sequence. At these sites, Smad3/4 cooperates with CREB to activate transcription in response to TGF-beta, and disruption of either binding sequence abolished TGF-beta-induced transcription. In addition, AML1 or AML2 also binds to the promoter and cooperates with Smad3/4, and in this way further enhances the TGF-beta-induced transcriptional activation of the GL Ig alpha promoter. Thus, whereas Smad3/4, CREB, and AML family members bind independently to the respective DNA sequences in the GL Ig alpha promoter, functional synergy of Smads with CREB and AML proteins results in maximal TGF-beta-induced transcription.","['Zhang, Y', 'Derynck, R']","['Zhang Y', 'Derynck R']","['Departments of Growth and Development and Anatomy, Programs in Cell Biology and Developmental Biology, University of California at San Francisco, San Francisco, California 94143-0640, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'DNA/metabolism', 'DNA Primers', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental/*physiology', 'Immunoglobulin A/*genetics', 'Mice', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Protein Binding', 'Transcription Factors/metabolism/*physiology', 'Transcription, Genetic/*physiology', 'Transforming Growth Factor beta/*physiology']",2000/04/05 09:00,2000/07/15 11:00,['2000/04/05 09:00'],"['2000/04/05 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/07/15 11:00 [medline]', '2000/04/05 09:00 [entrez]']","['10.1074/jbc.M001526200 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(19)80301-0 [pii]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2000 Jun 2;275(22):16979-85. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M001526200.,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (Immunoglobulin A)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Transforming Growth Factor beta)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",,,,['CA63101/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Unlike wild-type RNase A, the G88R variant is toxic to cancer cells. Here, variants in which disulfide bonds were removed from or added to G88R RNase A were used to probe the relationship between conformational stability and cytotoxicity in a methodical manner. The conformational stability of the C40A/G88R/C95A and C65A/C72A/G88R variants is less than that of G88R RNase A. In contrast, a new disulfide bond that links the N and C termini (residues 4 and 118) increases the conformational stability of G88R RNase A and C65A/C72A/G88R RNase A. These changes have little effect on the ribonucleolytic activity of the enzyme or on its ability to evade the cytosolic ribonuclease inhibitor protein. The changes do, however, have a substantial effect on toxicity toward human erythroleukemia cells. Specifically, conformational stability correlates directly with cytotoxicity as well as with resistance to proteolysis. These data indicate that conformational stability is a key determinant of RNase A cytotoxicity and suggest that cytotoxicity relies on avoiding proteolysis. This finding suggests a means to produce new cancer chemotherapeutic agents based on mammalian ribonucleases.","['Klink, T A', 'Raines, R T']","['Klink TA', 'Raines RT']","['Department of Biochemistry and Department of Chemistry, University of Wisconsin, Madison, Wisconsin 53706, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,IM,"['Amino Acid Substitution', 'Animals', 'Cattle', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Egg Proteins/*chemistry/metabolism/*toxicity', 'Enzyme Stability', 'Genetic Variation', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute', 'Models, Molecular', 'Mutagenesis, Site-Directed', 'Protein Conformation', 'Protein Structure, Secondary', 'Recombinant Proteins/chemistry/metabolism/toxicity', 'Ribonuclease, Pancreatic/*chemistry/metabolism/toxicity', 'Ribonucleases/*chemistry/metabolism/*toxicity', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2000/04/05 09:00,2000/07/25 11:00,['2000/04/05 09:00'],"['2000/04/05 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/07/25 11:00 [medline]', '2000/04/05 09:00 [entrez]']","['10.1074/jbc.M001132200 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(19)83264-7 [pii]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2000 Jun 9;275(23):17463-7. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M001132200.,"['0 (Egg Proteins)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', 'EC 3.1.- (Ribonucleases)', 'EC 3.1.27.5 (Ribonuclease, Pancreatic)', 'ZE15FIT23E (ranpirnase)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Since the malignant aggregates are monoclonal B-cell proliferations, we sought to determine whether performing polymerase chain reaction for the immunoglobulin heavy-chain locus would be helpful in distinguishing these 2 entities. METHODS AND RESULTS: Scrapings from unstained bone marrow aspirate smears or touch preparations of bone marrow biopsies from 15 patients with benign bone marrow lymphoid aggregates and 18 patients with malignant lymphoid infiltrates were analyzed for rearrangements of the FR3 region of the immunoglobulin heavy-chain gene locus by a heminested polymerase chain reaction procedure. All specimens had amplifiable DNA, as shown by amplification of the ras proto-oncogene. None of the 15 cases of benign bone marrow lymphoid aggregates demonstrated clonality upon amplification of the immunoglobulin heavy-chain gene locus. In contrast, 8 of the 18 malignant samples were positive (P =.01 by chi(2) test; sensitivity, 44%; specificity, 100%; positive predictive value, 100%; negative predictive value, 60%). There was a tendency for there to be more lymphocytes in stained bone marrow aspirate smears from the cases of malignant lymphoid aggregates with a positive polymerase chain reaction result than in those without demonstrable clonality (36.0 +/- 35.4% vs 9.8 +/- 8.0%, P =.13). CONCLUSIONS: Polymerase chain reaction for the immunoglobulin heavy-chain gene locus may help distinguish benign from malignant bone marrow lymphoid aggregates. Although the presence of false-negative samples may be related to the relative lack of lymphocytes in the bone marrow aspirates, other factors, such as the lack of amplification of the FR3 region of the immunoglobulin heavy-chain gene locus in particular tumors, cannot be ruled out with certainty.","['Ben-Ezra, J', 'Hazelgrove, K', 'Ferreira-Gonzalez, A', 'Garrett, C T']","['Ben-Ezra J', 'Hazelgrove K', 'Ferreira-Gonzalez A', 'Garrett CT']","['Department of Pathology, Medical College of Virginia Campus of Virginia Commonwealth University, Richmond, VA 23298-0250, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Arch Pathol Lab Med,Archives of pathology & laboratory medicine,7607091,IM,"['Biopsy', 'Bone Marrow/immunology/*pathology', 'Breast Neoplasms/pathology', 'Carcinoma, Small Cell/pathology', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Female', 'Fever of Unknown Origin/pathology', 'Gene Rearrangement, B-Lymphocyte, Heavy Chain', 'Genes, Immunoglobulin', 'HIV Infections/pathology', 'Humans', 'Hypergammaglobulinemia/pathology', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/pathology', 'Lung Neoplasms/pathology', 'Lymphoid Tissue/immunology/*pathology', 'Lymphoma/genetics/immunology/*pathology', 'Lymphoma, Follicular/pathology', 'Neoplasms/*pathology', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction/*methods', 'Proto-Oncogene Mas', 'Thrombocytopenia/pathology']",2000/04/04 09:00,2000/06/03 09:00,['2000/04/04 09:00'],"['2000/04/04 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/06/03 09:00 [medline]', '2000/04/04 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.5858/2000-124-0511-CPCRHD [doi]'],ppublish,Arch Pathol Lab Med. 2000 Apr;124(4):511-5. doi: 10.5858/2000-124-0511-CPCRHD.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Moreover, a positive reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) of PML-RAR alpha is reported to be a sensitive predictor of relapse in APL. This prompted us to use RT-PCR for rapid diagnosis and monitoring of minimal residual disease in APL patients. METHODS: A nested RT-PCR technique was applied to detect the unique PML-RAR alpha fusion transcript in 13 APL patients. The test was applied to help clarify the diagnosis and monitor minimal residual disease after treatment. RESULTS: All 13 APL patients had a positive test result: five patients with the S-form, seven patients with the L-form and one patient with the V-form of mRNA fusion transcripts. Minimal residual disease was prospectively monitored using this technique in six patients. Although in clinical remission, all four patients treated with ATRA alone were persistently PCR positive. Of the six patients receiving various forms of consolidation chemotherapy, one was persistently PCR positive while in remission and relapsed four months after the positive PCR test. Five patients were PCR negative. One of the five negative patients relapsed six months after a negative PCR test. The other four patients remained in remission, with a follow-up period of 25 to 46 months after the negative test. PCR was performed in two patients who had been in continuous remission for 3.5 and seven years, respectively. They both had negative PCR tests. CONCLUSIONS: Nested RT-PCR is valuable for confirming the diagnosis of APL and in monitoring minimal residual disease. However, we found that negative test cannot absolutely exclude the possibility of future relapse.","['Gau, J P', 'Young, J H', 'Lin, T H', 'Yang, Y S']","['Gau JP', 'Young JH', 'Lin TH', 'Yang YS']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Taichung Veterans General Hospital, Taiwan, ROC.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],China (Republic : 1949- ),Zhonghua Yi Xue Za Zhi (Taipei),Zhonghua yi xue za zhi = Chinese medical journal; Free China ed,0005327,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Child', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', '*Gene Rearrangement', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*diagnosis/drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*genetics', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*genetics', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Tretinoin/therapeutic use']",2000/04/04 09:00,2000/04/29 09:00,['2000/04/04 09:00'],"['2000/04/04 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/04/29 09:00 [medline]', '2000/04/04 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Zhonghua Yi Xue Za Zhi (Taipei). 2000 Mar;63(3):175-81.,"['0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (promyelocytic leukemia-retinoic acid receptor alpha fusion oncoprotein)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Electric tractions and transmission lines of high voltage are their major sources, however, household appliances are also involved in generating EMFs. Although their biological effect has not as yet been well documented, they evoke an increasing concern as being suspected of their carcinogenic effect. This concern arises mainly from epidemiological studies, which indicate an increased risk for leukemia in children living in the vicinity of transmission lines of high voltage. The author presents a review of epidemiological and experimental studies on a possible effect of power-line frequency EMFs on the development of neoplastic diseases. Epidemiological data obtained to date shows that power-line frequency EMFs do not induce cancer risk and if this is the case the risk is marginal (relevant risk of 1-4 order). Nevertheless, this risk seems to be more evident in occupational than in environmental exposure. The results of experimental studies carried out on animals disclose a possible effect of EMFs as a factor contributing to the development of cancer induced by a known carcinogen. In order to answer the question put in the title it is necessary to continue a large scale investigations especially experimental ones.","['Sliwinska-Kowalska, M']",['Sliwinska-Kowalska M'],"['Zakladu Zagrozen Fizycznych, Instytutu Medycyny Pracy, Lodzi.']",['pol'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",Poland,Med Pr,Medycyna pracy,0376642,IM,"['Electromagnetic Fields/*adverse effects', '*Environment', 'Environmental Exposure/*adverse effects', 'Humans', 'Neoplasms/*etiology', 'Risk Factors']",2000/04/04 09:00,2000/05/08 09:00,['2000/04/04 09:00'],"['2000/04/04 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/05/08 09:00 [medline]', '2000/04/04 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Med Pr. 1999;50(6):581-91.,,74,,,,,,,Ekspozycja srodowiskowa na pola elektromagnetyczne a ryzyko rozwoju chorob nowotworowych.,,,,,,,,,,,,

The electrocardiographic changes and arrhythmia improved after correction of the hypokalemia. An inverse correlation between leukocyte count and hypokalemia was observed. The patient died from pulmonary hemorrhage. Autopsy examination demonstrated myocardial degeneration consistent with damage induced by antineoplastic antibiotics. The cumulative dose of anthracycline and anthraquinone was less than the conventional dose limit associated with chronic cardiotoxicity, even for children who are more sensitive to anthracyclines.

Two of the patients presented with grand mal seizures and one presented with a headache.

In two of the patients computed tomography (CT) of the brain was normal and in the third showed non-specific abnormalities. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with MR angiography (MRA) demonstrated cerebral venous sinus thrombosis in all three patients.

We reviewed our recent experience with two dual-lumen, large-bore, Silastic multi-purpose ('hybrid') catheters, each of which can be used as a single device for both leukapheresis and long-term supportive care throughout the transplant process. Quinton-Raaf PermCath and Bard-Hickman hemodialysis/apheresis dual-lumen catheters were used as the sole venous access device in 112 consecutive patients who underwent autologous PBPC collection and transplantation. The catheter exit site was monitored three times a week, and lumen patency was assessed using clinical and radiologic techniques. Catheters were removed prematurely for persistent thrombus, positive blood cultures despite appropriate antibiotics, or mechanical dysfunction. There were no intra-operative or immediate post-operative complications relating to insertion. Thirty-two patients experienced catheter occlusion necessitating urokinase instillation. Persistent occlusive problems were noted in 16 patients, and in 10 patients the catheter had to be removed. Two exit site infections and 17 bacteremias occurred. Catheters had to be removed for persistent infection in two subjects and for mechanical problems in five others. Cost analysis comparing the hybrid catheters alone vs conventional devices revealed a charge of $4230 in patients with hybrid catheters vs. $7530 in those requiring a temporary non-Silastic dialysis catheter in addition to a flexible, long-term Silastic catheter. Hybrid, Silastic, dual-lumen, large-bore central venous catheters are safe, cost-effective and convenient multi-purpose venous access devices that may be used in the setting of autologous PBPC collection and transplantation.

We firstly demonstrated that although the CCR and MCR groups were clinically, cytogenetically and molecularly indistinguishable at diagnosis, the two groups could be recognized successfully during interferon therapy based on the level of bcr-abl transcript.","['Martinelli, G', 'Testoni, N', 'Amabile, M', 'Bonifazi, F', 'De Vivo, A', 'Farabegoli, P', 'Terragna, C', 'Montefusco, V', 'Ottaviani, E', 'Saglio, G', 'Russo, D', 'Baccarani, M', 'Rosti, G', 'Tura, S']","['Martinelli G', 'Testoni N', 'Amabile M', 'Bonifazi F', 'De Vivo A', 'Farabegoli P', 'Terragna C', 'Montefusco V', 'Ottaviani E', 'Saglio G', 'Russo D', 'Baccarani M', 'Rosti G', 'Tura S']","[""Institute of Haematology and Medical Oncology 'Seragnoli', University of Bologna, Italy.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Bone Marrow Transplant,Bone marrow transplantation,8702459,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Bone Marrow Cells/*pathology', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Cytarabine/*therapeutic use', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*genetics', 'Genes, abl', 'Humans', 'Interferon alpha-2', 'Interferon-alpha/*therapeutic use', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/*genetics/pathology/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Recombinant Proteins', 'Remission Induction', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Time Factors', '*Transcription, Genetic', 'Transplantation, Autologous']",2000/04/04 09:00,2000/05/20 09:00,['2000/04/04 09:00'],"['2000/04/04 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/05/20 09:00 [medline]', '2000/04/04 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.bmt.1702207 [doi]'],ppublish,Bone Marrow Transplant. 2000 Apr;25(7):729-36. doi: 10.1038/sj.bmt.1702207.,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Interferon alpha-2)', '0 (Interferon-alpha)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Twenty-three B-CLL patients were transplanted between 1988 and 1997 using stem cells from a related (n = 20) or an unrelated donor (n = 3). The median age of the patients was 46 years, and the median number of prior chemotherapy regimens received was two. At transplantation, 14 patients had chemorefractory disease and 12 of these were refractory to fludarabine. The preparative regimens included total body irradiation (TBI) in 22 of the 23 cases. All patients received graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis with cyclosporine and methotrexate. Twenty patients (87%) achieved a complete remission (CR). The incidence of grade II-IV acute GVHD was 54%. Fourteen (61%) patients are alive and disease-free, including two with unrelated donors, at a median of 26 months (range, 9-115 months). Nine patients (39%) have died, one of whom had progressive B-CLL. The only favorable prognostic factor for failure-free survival (FFS) and overall survival (OS) after alloSCT was the use of a cyclophosphamide/TBI rather than an etoposide/cyclophosphamide/TBI regimen (P = 0.03). The projected 5-year FFS, OS, and relapse rates after alloSCT were 65% (95% CI, 48-88%), 62% (95% CI, 43-88%), and 5% (95%, CI 0-13%), respectively. These findings demonstrate the potential of high-dose therapy and alloSCT for inducing and maintaining a remission in patients with advanced or chemorefractory B-CLL. The low relapse rate may be due to an allogeneic graft-versus-leukemia effect.","['Pavletic, Z S', 'Arrowsmith, E R', 'Bierman, P J', 'Goodman, S A', 'Vose, J M', 'Tarantolo, S R', 'Stein, R S', 'Bociek, G', 'Greer, J P', 'Wu, C D', 'Kollath, J P', 'Weisenburger, D D', 'Kessinger, A', 'Wolff, S N', 'Armitage, J O', 'Bishop, M R']","['Pavletic ZS', 'Arrowsmith ER', 'Bierman PJ', 'Goodman SA', 'Vose JM', 'Tarantolo SR', 'Stein RS', 'Bociek G', 'Greer JP', 'Wu CD', 'Kollath JP', 'Weisenburger DD', 'Kessinger A', 'Wolff SN', 'Armitage JO', 'Bishop MR']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Section of Oncology and Hematology, University of Nebraska Medical Center, Omaha, Nebraska 68198-3330, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Bone Marrow Transplant,Bone marrow transplantation,8702459,IM,"['Adult', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Cohort Studies', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease/epidemiology', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/mortality/pathology/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Recurrence', 'Remission Induction', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Analysis', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Treatment Outcome']",2000/04/04 09:00,2000/05/20 09:00,['2000/04/04 09:00'],"['2000/04/04 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/05/20 09:00 [medline]', '2000/04/04 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.bmt.1702237 [doi]'],ppublish,Bone Marrow Transplant. 2000 Apr;25(7):717-22. doi: 10.1038/sj.bmt.1702237.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Both mean TPO and IL-6 levels showed a marked rise and later fall preceding or coincident with the platelet nadir and recovery, suggesting their potential role as circulating regulators or stimulators of thrombopoiesis. In contrast, IL-11 levels remained remarkably constant through the whole course suggesting that this cytokine, though capable of stimulating thrombopoiesis, does not serve as a circulating regulator of platelet production. Additionally, we assayed the levels of these three cytokines following initial platelet transfusion to assess the capacity of transfused platelets to adsorb these thrombopoietic cytokines from the plasma and reduce their circulating levels, thus potentially modifying their availability for stimulating megakaryocyte proliferation. No consistent falls in TPO, IL-6 or IL-11 levels were observed following the initial two platelet transfusions. These data support the importance of circulating TPO and IL-6 as hormones capable of stimulating platelet production. Their physiologic relevance as in vivo regulators of thrombopoiesis and clinical utility for therapy of thrombocytopenia need further investigation.","['Weisdorf, D J', 'DeFor, T', 'Nichol, J', 'Panoskaltsis-Mortari, A', 'Blazar, B R']","['Weisdorf DJ', 'DeFor T', 'Nichol J', 'Panoskaltsis-Mortari A', 'Blazar BR']","['Blood and Marrow Transplant Program, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Bone Marrow Transplant,Bone marrow transplantation,8702459,IM,"['Adult', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/*physiology', 'Breast Neoplasms/therapy', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-11/blood', 'Interleukin-6/*blood', 'Leukemia/therapy', 'Lymphoma/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Platelet Count', 'Platelet Transfusion', 'Thrombopoietin/*blood', 'Time Factors', 'Transplantation, Autologous', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",2000/04/04 09:00,2000/05/20 09:00,['2000/04/04 09:00'],"['2000/04/04 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/05/20 09:00 [medline]', '2000/04/04 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.bmt.1702221 [doi]'],ppublish,Bone Marrow Transplant. 2000 Apr;25(7):711-5. doi: 10.1038/sj.bmt.1702221.,"['0 (Interleukin-11)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '9014-42-0 (Thrombopoietin)']",,,,"['CA65493/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL49997/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The peptide (Phe-Arg-Pro-Arg-Ile-Met-Thr-Pro) originally isolated from the culture medium of porcine bone marrow cell culture was examined for its ability to induce differentiation in two human myeloid leukemia cell lines, HL-60 and K-562. Agents with well-known differentiation-inducing activity, such as phorbol myristate acetate, dimethylsulfoxide and the lymphokines were used as a reference. It has been shown that MP-4 significantly influences the integral characteristics of metabolism, expression of surface antigens and morphology of these cells. It decreased the level of chromosomal DNA synthesis and, in parallel, increased the total protein synthesis in both HL-60 and K-562 cells. MP-4 induced the expression of CD14 monocyte-specific surface antigen and the appearance of mature monocytes/macrophages in HL-60 cell cultures. There was a good correlation of cell metabolic/morphological changes and the CD14 marker expression for HL-60 cells. A similar phenomenon was observed in K-562 cells treated with MP-4 when the levels of hemoglobin synthesis were detected in their cytoplasm. Thus, we consider MP-4 as a new endogenous differentiating factor for myeloid cells.","['Strelkov, L A', 'Mikhailova, A A', 'Fonina, L A', 'Petrov, R V']","['Strelkov LA', 'Mikhailova AA', 'Fonina LA', 'Petrov RV']","['Shemyakin-Ovchinnikov Institute of Bioorganic Chemistry, 16/10 Miklukho-Maklaya, 117871, Moscow, Russia. stas@ibch.siobc.ras.ru']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,FEBS Lett,FEBS letters,0155157,IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Cell Differentiation/*drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Size/drug effects', 'Culture Media, Conditioned/pharmacology', 'DNA/biosynthesis', 'Dimethyl Sulfoxide/pharmacology', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Hemoglobins/biosynthesis', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Lipopolysaccharide Receptors/metabolism', 'Lymphokines/immunology/pharmacology', 'Macrophages/cytology/drug effects/metabolism', 'Monocytes/*cytology/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Oligopeptides/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Protein Biosynthesis', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Up-Regulation/drug effects']",2000/04/04 09:00,2000/05/08 09:00,['2000/04/04 09:00'],"['2000/04/04 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/05/08 09:00 [medline]', '2000/04/04 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0014-5793(00)01344-2 [pii]', '10.1016/s0014-5793(00)01344-2 [doi]']",ppublish,FEBS Lett. 2000 Mar 31;470(3):281-4. doi: 10.1016/s0014-5793(00)01344-2.,"['0 (Culture Media, Conditioned)', '0 (Hemoglobins)', '0 (Lipopolysaccharide Receptors)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Oligopeptides)', '137833-32-0 (myelopeptides)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)', 'YOW8V9698H (Dimethyl Sulfoxide)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The PUFA-sensitive cell lines Raji and Ramos, which die by necrosis and apoptosis upon incubation with EPA respectively, had 2- to 3-fold higher uptake rate of EPA than the PUFA-resistant U-698 cell line. Furthermore, Ramos cells contained more lipid bodies and 3-fold more triacylglycerol than U-698 cells after 24 h incubation with 60 microm EPA. The mechanism behind the increased rate of EPA uptake in the PUFA-sensitive cell lines was examined by comparing the expression of 6 different fatty acid binding proteins (FABPs) and 3 acyl-CoA synthetases (ACSs) in U-698 and Ramos cells. Moreover, enzymatic activity of ACS and acyl-CoA:1,2-diacylglycerol acyltransferase (ADGAT) was investigated. The protein expression level of CD36 and p-FABPpm, the mRNA level of FABP, liver-FABP, heart-FABP, intestinal-FABP, ACS1, ACS2, and enzymatic ADGAT activity were similar in the two cell lines. However, an mRNA signal observed with a probe for ACS3 was 1.7 times higher in Ramos than in U-698 cells, and lysate from Ramos cells had a higher capacity to activate EPA to EPA-CoA than U-698 cell lysate. In conclusion, the present findings indicate that cellular uptake, activation and incorporation of EPA into lipids may be related to induction of cell death in leukemia cell lines.","['Finstad, H S', 'Dyrendal, H', 'Myhrstad, M C', 'Heimli, H', 'Drevon, C A']","['Finstad HS', 'Dyrendal H', 'Myhrstad MC', 'Heimli H', 'Drevon CA']","['Institute for Nutrition Research, University of Oslo, P.O.

In the present study, we have demonstrated that signals through gp130 increase the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in cardiac myocytes via the signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) 3 pathway. After activation of gp130 with leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), expression of VEGF mRNA rapidly increased with a peak at 3 h in cultured cardiac myocytes. Cardiotrophin-1 also enhanced VEGF mRNA expression in a dose-dependent manner. VEGF protein production and secretion to the medium were also enhanced by LIF and cardiotrophin-1 but not by interleukin-6. Adenovirus transfer of the dominant-negative form of STAT3 to cultured cardiac myocytes inhibited induction of VEGF expression induced by LIF, but neither PD98059 nor wortmannin was affected. In murine hearts, intravenous administration of LIF augmented expression of VEGF mRNA; however, the hearts of transgenic mice overexpressing dominant-negative STAT3 showed reduced expression of VEGF mRNA that was not induced after LIF stimulation.

A potential mechanism for Tax-mediated repression of the transcriptional activity of basic helix-loop-helix factors.,10551-60,"The human T cell leukemia/lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-1) Tax protein strongly activates viral and cellular gene transcription. It mainly functions by interacting with cellular transcription factors and the KIX domain of the p300/CBP coactivators. Tax can also repress the transcription of cellular genes through the basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) protein family. To investigate the molecular mechanisms of this Tax-mediated inhibition, we analyzed its effect on the transcriptional activity of the myogenic MyoD protein, which was used as a paradigm of bHLH factors. In this study, we show that overexpression of the p300 coactivator in transient transfection assays was sufficient to rescue MyoD repression by Tax. Furthermore, an N-terminal domain of p300 (amino acids 379-654) containing the region of KIX serving as the Tax binding site was found, when overexpressed, to potentiate Tax-mediated transactivation of HTLV-1 proviral as well as MyoD-dependent transcription, and to antagonize the inhibition by Tax of the transcriptional activity of MyoD. These results revealing the presence of an N-terminal MyoD binding site were confirmed by in vitro protein-protein interaction assays that demonstrate that MyoD binds to the KIX domain of p300 and that Tax competes with MyoD binding in a nonreciprocal manner. These observations provide evidence that Tax binding to the KIX domain of p300 prevents bHLH proteins from contacting this N-terminal domain of the coactivator, thus resulting in their transcriptional repression. As bHLH proteins are implicated in many developmental fate decisions, especially during thymopoiesis, Tax-mediated inhibition of their transcriptional activity may contribute to the induction of HTLV-1-linked leukemogenesis.","['Riou, P', 'Bex, F', 'Gazzolo, L']","['Riou P', 'Bex F', 'Gazzolo L']","['Immuno-Virologie Moleculaire et Cellulaire, Unite Mixte de Recherche 5537, CNRS-Universite Claude Bernard Lyon I, Faculte de Medecine Lyon Laennec, 69372 Lyon Cedex 8, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,IM,"['Animals', 'Binding Sites', 'CREB-Binding Protein', 'Cell Line', 'Chloramphenicol O-Acetyltransferase/genetics', 'Gene Products, tax/*metabolism', 'Helix-Loop-Helix Motifs', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'MyoD Protein/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Nuclear Proteins/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Recombinant Proteins/metabolism', 'Trans-Activators/chemistry/*metabolism', '*Transcription, Genetic', 'Transcriptional Activation', 'Transfection']",2000/04/01 09:00,2000/05/16 09:00,['2000/04/01 09:00'],"['2000/04/01 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/05/16 09:00 [medline]', '2000/04/01 09:00 [entrez]']","['10.1074/jbc.275.14.10551 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(19)89944-1 [pii]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2000 Apr 7;275(14):10551-60. doi: 10.1074/jbc.275.14.10551.,"['0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (MyoD Protein)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', 'EC 2.3.1.28 (Chloramphenicol O-Acetyltransferase)', 'EC 2.3.1.48 (CREB-Binding Protein)', 'EC 2.3.1.48 (CREBBP protein, human)', 'EC 2.3.1.48 (Crebbp protein, mouse)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The antibody binds to CD52, a highly glycosylated molecule attached to the membrane by a glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchor. Cross-linked Campath-1H is known to activate T cells in vitro. We have investigated the molecular basis for these effects by comparing the protein tyrosine phosphorylation signals induced by Campath-1H and the CD3 mAb OKT3 in primary T cells, and in CD45(+)TCR(+), CD45(-)TCR(+) and CD45(+)TCR(-) Jurkat subclones transfected with CD52. Our results show that Campath-1H triggers similar tyrosine phosphorylation events as OKT3 in both primary T cells and in the CD45(+)TCR(+) Jurkat sub-clone, albeit at quantitatively lower levels. However, no phospholipase C gamma 1 activation nor calcium signals were detected in response to CD52 ligation. The CD52-mediated induction of protein tyrosine phosphorylation was absolutely dependent upon the expression of both the TCR and the CD45 phosphotyrosine phosphatase at the cell surface. Cross-linking of Campath-1H was essential for signal transduction in all cells investigated. Fluorescence resonance energy transfer was used to demonstrate CD52 homo-association at the cell surface in Jurkat T cells in a TCR- and CD45-independent manner, and CD52-TCR association in CD45(+)TCR(+) cells. We propose a model to explain the activating effects of Campath-1H in which CD52 mAb cross-linking causes the trapping of TCR polypeptides within molecular complexes at the cell surface, thereby inducing signals via the TCR by a process which depends on the CD45-mediated regulation of the p56(lck) and p59(fyn) tyrosine kinases.","['Hederer, R A', 'Guntermann, C', 'Miller, N', 'Nagy, P', 'Szollosi, J', 'Damjanovich, S', 'Hale, G', 'Alexander, D R']","['Hederer RA', 'Guntermann C', 'Miller N', 'Nagy P', 'Szollosi J', 'Damjanovich S', 'Hale G', 'Alexander DR']","['Laboratory of Lymphocyte Signalling and Development, Molecular Immunology Programme, The Babraham Institute, Cambridge CB2 4AT, UK.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Int Immunol,International immunology,8916182,IM,"['Alemtuzumab', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/*physiology', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized', 'Antibodies, Neoplasm/*physiology', 'Antigens, CD/metabolism/*physiology', '*Antigens, Neoplasm', 'CD52 Antigen', 'Calcium/physiology', 'Calcium Signaling/immunology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Glycoproteins/metabolism/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Inositol 1,4,5-Trisphosphate/immunology', 'Isoenzymes/immunology', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Leukocyte Common Antigens/*physiology', 'Phospholipase C gamma', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/metabolism/*physiology', 'Signal Transduction/genetics/*immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes/*enzymology/*immunology/metabolism', 'Transfection', 'Type C Phospholipases/immunology']",2000/04/01 09:00,2000/08/01 11:00,['2000/04/01 09:00'],"['2000/04/01 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/08/01 11:00 [medline]', '2000/04/01 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/intimm/12.4.505 [doi]'],ppublish,Int Immunol. 2000 Apr;12(4):505-16. doi: 10.1093/intimm/12.4.505.,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized)', '0 (Antibodies, Neoplasm)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (CD52 Antigen)', '0 (CD52 protein, human)', '0 (Glycoproteins)', '0 (Isoenzymes)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)', '3A189DH42V (Alemtuzumab)', '85166-31-0 (Inositol 1,4,5-Trisphosphate)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Leukocyte Common Antigens)', 'EC 3.1.4.- (Type C Phospholipases)', 'EC 3.1.4.3 (Phospholipase C gamma)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In order to examine the tumor-suppressing activity of TEA against adult T-cell leukemia (ATL), we cultivated peripheral blood T lymphocytes of ATL patients (ATL PBLs), an HTLV-I-infected T-cell line (KODV) and healthy controls (normal PBLs) for 3 days in the presence of TEA and its main constituent, epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCg), to measure cell proliferation and apoptosis, and to quantitate mRNAs of HTLV-I pX and beta-actin genes of the cultured cells. Growth of ATL PBLs was significantly inhibited by 9-27 microg/ml of TEA and EGCg, in contrast to minimal growth inhibition of T cells of normal PBLs. Inhibition of KODV was intermediate between ATL PBLs and normal PBLs. The ATL PBLs and KODV treated with 27 microg/ml of either TEA or EGCg induced apoptotic DNA fragmentation, producing terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP-biotin nick end labeling (TUNEL)-positive cells, while the normal PBLs treated with the same concentration of TEA or EGCg produced a negligibly small number of TUNEL-positive cells, in which apoptotic DNA fragmentation was not detectable. Expression of HTLV-I pX mRNA was suppressed more than 90% in ATL PBLs by treatment with 3-27 microg/ml of either TEA or EGCg, while expression of beta-actin mRNA was much less suppressed by treatment with the same concentration of TEA or EGCg. These results indicate that TEA and EGCg inhibit growth of ATL PBLs, as well as HTLV-I-infected T-cells, by suppressing HTLV-I pX gene expression and inducing apoptotic cell death.","['Li, H C', 'Yashiki, S', 'Sonoda, J', 'Lou, H', 'Ghosh, S K', 'Byrnes, J J', 'Lema, C', 'Fujiyoshi, T', 'Karasuyama, M', 'Sonoda, S']","['Li HC', 'Yashiki S', 'Sonoda J', 'Lou H', 'Ghosh SK', 'Byrnes JJ', 'Lema C', 'Fujiyoshi T', 'Karasuyama M', 'Sonoda S']","['Department of Virology, Faculty of Medicine, Kagoshima University, Sakuragaoka.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Japan,Jpn J Cancer Res,Japanese journal of cancer research : Gann,8509412,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Anticarcinogenic Agents/pharmacology', '*Apoptosis', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Catechin/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Cell Division', 'DNA Fragmentation/drug effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Female', '*Flavonoids', 'Gene Expression/drug effects', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'In Situ Nick-End Labeling', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/*blood/*pathology', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*blood/*pathology', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/cytology/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Phenols/*pharmacology', '*Phytotherapy', 'Polymers/*pharmacology', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'T-Lymphocytes/drug effects/*pathology', 'Tea/*therapeutic use', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2000/04/01 09:00,2000/04/25 09:00,['2000/04/01 09:00'],"['2000/04/01 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/04/25 09:00 [medline]', '2000/04/01 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1349-7006.2000.tb00857.x [doi]'],ppublish,Jpn J Cancer Res. 2000 Jan;91(1):34-40. doi: 10.1111/j.1349-7006.2000.tb00857.x.,"['0 (Anticarcinogenic Agents)', '0 (Flavonoids)', '0 (Phenols)', '0 (Polymers)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Tea)', '8R1V1STN48 (Catechin)', 'BQM438CTEL (epigallocatechin gallate)']",,PMC5926221,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The present study was performed to evaluate in vitro the expression of Fas-L in human microglial cells both unstimulated and after stimulation with IFN-gamma, beta-IFN-1b and beta-IFN-1b+IFN-gamma. Cells were stimulated for 6,12, 24 and 48 h. Surface Fas-L was evaluated by flow cytometry, total Fas-L by Western blot, whereas mRNA for Fas-L was measured by RT-PCR. We also evaluated the capacity of microglial cells to induce, in vitro, apoptosis on Fas-positive T leukemia Jurkat cells. Our results showed a constitutive expression of Fas-L on microglia. IFN-gamma downregulated the expression of the molecule, while beta-IFN-1b and beta-IFN-1b+IFN- gamma did not. The amount of surface Fas-L was related to the ability of microglial cells to induce apoptosis in Fas-positive target cells, which was partly inhibited by blockade of the Fas-Fas-L pathway.","['Frigerio, S', 'Silei, V', 'Ciusani, E', 'Massa, G', 'Lauro, G M', 'Salmaggi, A']","['Frigerio S', 'Silei V', 'Ciusani E', 'Massa G', 'Lauro GM', 'Salmaggi A']","[""Istituto Nazionale Neurologico 'C.

Cytokine-supplemented suspension cultures of leukemic blasts in 98 patients with AML and five patients with ALL (normal karyotype, n = 2; BCR/ABL, n = 3) were performed. Mononuclear cells out of peripheral blood or bone marrow containing between 60% and 90% leukemic blasts were cultured for eight days using different growth factor combinations. The highest yield of CD1a(+)/CD14(-) cells could be obtained with stem cell factor, transforming growth factor-beta, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, GM-CSF, and FLT-3-ligand. In the AML samples the median content of CD1a(+)/CD14(-) cells after eight days of culture was 3.5% (r = 0%-82%). In five informed patients CD1a(+)/CD14(-) cells were sorted by fluorescence-activated cell sorting or immunomagnetic separation. Cytogenetic and polymerase chain reaction analyses showed known primary chromosomal aberrations (monosomy 7 and inversion 16) in the sorted fractions, respectively. Dendritic cells (DC) could be generated out of leukemic blasts in 68% of AML patients. Leukemic DC showed no phagocytosis of latex beads, but stimulated allogeneic naive cord blood-derived T cells more efficiently than did uncultured blasts. In ALL patients the median percentage of CD1a(+)/CD14(-) cells was 1.2% (r = 0.7%-3.8%) after culture. The sorted CD1(+)/CD14(-) fractions were BCR/ABL-negative when analyzed with fluorescence in situ hybridization, indicating their nonleukemic origin. Leukemic DC can be generated out of leukemic progenitors in patients with AML. These cells might become relevant for autologous and allogeneic immunotherapy in selected patients. BCR/ABL-positive lymphoblasts could not be transformed into cells with an early dendritic phenotype with the cytokines used in our experiments.","['Kohler, T', 'Plettig, R', 'Wetzstein, W', 'Schmitz, M', 'Ritter, M', 'Mohr, B', 'Schaekel, U', 'Ehninger, G', 'Bornhauser, M']","['Kohler T', 'Plettig R', 'Wetzstein W', 'Schmitz M', 'Ritter M', 'Mohr B', 'Schaekel U', 'Ehninger G', 'Bornhauser M']","['Medizinische Klinik und Poliklinik I, Institute for Immunology, Universitatsklinikum Carl Gustav Carus, Dresden, Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Stem Cells,"Stem cells (Dayton, Ohio)",9304532,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antigens, CD1/analysis', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cytokines/*pharmacology', 'Dendritic Cells/classification/cytology/*drug effects/immunology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', '*Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute', 'Lipopolysaccharide Receptors/analysis', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2000/04/01 09:00,2000/07/06 11:00,['2000/04/01 09:00'],"['2000/04/01 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/07/06 11:00 [medline]', '2000/04/01 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1634/stemcells.18-2-139 [doi]'],ppublish,Stem Cells. 2000;18(2):139-47. doi: 10.1634/stemcells.18-2-139.,"['0 (Antigens, CD1)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Lipopolysaccharide Receptors)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, it has been unclear whether TPO stimulates proliferation of MDS blasts, as observed in de novo acute myeloid leukemia. This study examined this concern. When marrow cells from 37 MDS cases were cultured with or without recombinant human PEGylated TPO, TPO increased the blast number (stimulation index > or =1.5) in 9 of 16 high-risk MDS cases (refractory anemia with excess blasts [RAEB] and RAEB in transformation) and 4 of 10 cases with MDS transformed to acute leukemia (MDS-AL), but none of 11 cases with low-risk MDS (RA and RA with ringed sideroblasts). When the cell cycle of cultured cells was determined by three-color flow cytometry, TPO activated the cell cycle of MDS cells (causing a decrease in G(0)-phase cells) in most of the cases whose blast number increased in response to TPO. Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction analysis detected TPO receptor messenger RNA in purified blasts from all six cases examined, irrespective of the response of their blasts to TPO in culture. Analysis of the patients' characteristics identified a high-serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) value as being associated with blast proliferation in high-risk MDS cases (p = 0.0036). We conclude that TPO stimulates in vitro proliferation of blasts from a fraction of MDS patients. High-risk MDS patients, especially those who have a high-serum LDH value, and MDS-AL patients should be monitored with particular care in clinical trials of TPO for MDS.","['Luo, S S', 'Ogata, K', 'Yokose, N', 'Kato, T', 'Dan, K']","['Luo SS', 'Ogata K', 'Yokose N', 'Kato T', 'Dan K']","['Third Department of Internal Medicine, Nippon Medical School, Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Stem Cells,"Stem cells (Dayton, Ohio)",9304532,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Bone Marrow Cells/*drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Female', 'Gene Expression', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Myelodysplastic Syndromes', '*Neoplasm Proteins', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics', 'RNA, Messenger', '*Receptors, Cytokine', 'Receptors, Thrombopoietin', 'Thrombopoietin/*pharmacology']",2000/04/01 09:00,2000/07/06 11:00,['2000/04/01 09:00'],"['2000/04/01 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/07/06 11:00 [medline]', '2000/04/01 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1634/stemcells.18-2-112 [doi]'],ppublish,Stem Cells. 2000;18(2):112-9. doi: 10.1634/stemcells.18-2-112.,"['0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Cytokine)', '0 (Receptors, Thrombopoietin)', '143641-95-6 (MPL protein, human)', '9014-42-0 (Thrombopoietin)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PROCEDURE: By employing the cases of the Registry of Childhood Malignancies in Hokkaido Prefecture, Japan, from 1969 to 1996, the numbers of malignancies in cases (diagnosis at 0-14 years of age) with Down syndrome (DS), mental retardation (MR) excluding DS, luxatio coxae congenita (LCC), congenital heart disease (CHD) excluding DS, undescended testicle (UT), and cleft palate-lip (CPL) were calculated. Using the percentages of malignancies in the 2,349 cases without malformation, expected numbers of malignancies in the cases with the malformations were calculated. The observed numbers were statistically compared to expected ones. RESULTS: In the DS cases, leukemia developed with a significantly high frequency, but no UT cases developed leukemia. No brain tumor was preceded by DS. This could not be explained only by early death from coexisting diseases such as CHD, insofar as the CHD cases without DS developed brain tumors more frequently than expected. The ratio of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) to acute nonlymphoblastic leukemia (ANLL) was different among the malformations. The MR cases developed ANLL more frequently than expected, whereas the CPL cases developed ALL more frequently. The distribution of the age at diagnosis for Wilms' tumor was different according to the underlying malformation. CONCLUSIONS: Malformations might have some factors that inhibit or delay as well as promote the development of certain malignancies.","['Nishi, M', 'Miyake, H', 'Takeda, T', 'Hatae, Y']","['Nishi M', 'Miyake H', 'Takeda T', 'Hatae Y']","['Department of Public Health, Sapporo Medical University, Sapporo, Hokkaido, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,Med Pediatr Oncol,Medical and pediatric oncology,7506654,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Age Factors', 'Brain Neoplasms/epidemiology', 'Chi-Square Distribution', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cleft Lip/epidemiology', 'Cleft Palate/epidemiology', 'Congenital Abnormalities/*epidemiology', 'Cryptorchidism/epidemiology', 'Down Syndrome/epidemiology', 'Heart Defects, Congenital/epidemiology', 'Hip Dislocation, Congenital/epidemiology', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Intellectual Disability/epidemiology', 'Japan/epidemiology', 'Kidney Neoplasms/epidemiology', 'Leukemia/epidemiology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/epidemiology', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/*epidemiology', 'Poisson Distribution', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/epidemiology', 'Registries', 'Wilms Tumor/epidemiology']",2000/03/31 09:00,2000/04/29 09:00,['2000/03/31 09:00'],"['2000/03/31 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/04/29 09:00 [medline]', '2000/03/31 09:00 [entrez]']","['10.1002/(SICI)1096-911X(200004)34:4<250::AID-MPO3>3.0.CO;2-W [pii]', '10.1002/(sici)1096-911x(200004)34:4<250::aid-mpo3>3.0.co;2-w [doi]']",ppublish,Med Pediatr Oncol. 2000 Apr;34(4):250-4. doi: 10.1002/(sici)1096-911x(200004)34:4<250::aid-mpo3>3.0.co;2-w.,,,,"['Copyright 2000 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Examinations of the peripheral blood, bone marrow, and cerebrospinal fluid showed no recurrent leukemic cells. Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging of the brain disclosed unexpected CDST at the left transverse sinus, which was seen only on the fast fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) sequence. His symptoms were relieved soon after treatment with heparin. MR imaging with FLAIR performed a second time 7 days later showed complete disappearance of the thrombosis. The patient was treated continuously with oral anticoagulant therapy and the symptoms did not recur. CDST can be diagnosed in its early phase by MR studies with FLAIR images.

CD3+ LGL leukemia is the most frequent form of LGL leukemia. T-LGL leukemia usually affects elderly people. Approximately 60% of patients are symptomatic; recurrent infections secondary to chonic neutropenia, anemia, and rheumatoid arthrititis are the main clinical manifestations. The most common phenotype is CD3+, alphabeta+, CD8+, CD57+. Clonality is detected by clonal rearrangement of the T-cell receptor gene. NK-cell LGL proliferative disorders include NK LGL leukemia which is a very aggressive disease and NK chronic lymphocytosis. Serologic findings show frequent reactivity to the BA21 epitope of HTLV-I env p21e, suggesting that a cellular or retroviral protein with homology to BA21 may be important in pathogenesis of these diseases. Clonal expansion may be facilitated by IL12 and IL15 cytokines expressed by leukemic LGL, and also by a defective Fas (CD95) apoptotic pathway. Leukemic LGL constitutively express Fas and Fas-Ligand but they are resistant to Fas-induced apotosis. Neutropenia could be due to soluble Fas-Ligand which is highly secreted in the patient's sera. Clinical and molecular remission can be obtained with oral low-dose methotrexate. Leukemic LGL express a multi-drug resistance phenotype (PgP+/LRP+) that could partly explain the chemoresistance observed in aggressive cases. It is suggested that LGL leukemia can serve as a useful model of dysregulated apoptosis as an underlying mechanism for both malignancy and autoimmune disease.","['Lamy, T', 'Loughran, T P Jr']","['Lamy T', 'Loughran TP Jr']","[""H.

We have devised an efficient and effective method for purification of the chaperone proteins grp94/gp96, HSP90, HSP70, and calreticulin from harvested A20 murine leukemia/lymphoma tumor material. We have demonstrated that these purified proteins, when used as vaccines, can induce potent and specific immunity against a lethal tumor challenge. Individual chaperone proteins were differentially effective in their abilities to provide immune protection. The increase in survival generated by the most effective chaperone vaccine, HSP70, resulted from at least a 2-log reduction in tumor burden. Syngeneic granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor producing fibroblasts were injected at the site of vaccination in an attempt to augment the immune response. Surprisingly, localized granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor production inhibited the protective effects of chaperone vaccination. These studies provide evidence that chaperone proteins can be isolated from B-cell tumors and used effectively to immunize against disseminated lymphoid malignancies.","['Graner, M', 'Raymond, A', 'Romney, D', 'He, L', 'Whitesell, L', 'Katsanis, E']","['Graner M', 'Raymond A', 'Romney D', 'He L', 'Whitesell L', 'Katsanis E']","[""Department of Pediatrics, Steele Memorial Children's Research Center, University of Arizona, Tucson 85724-5073, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,IM,"['3T3 Cells', 'Animals', 'Calcium-Binding Proteins/isolation & purification/therapeutic use', 'Calreticulin', 'Cancer Vaccines/isolation & purification/therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/genetics/physiology', 'HSP70 Heat-Shock Proteins/isolation & purification/therapeutic use', 'HSP90 Heat-Shock Proteins/isolation & purification/therapeutic use', 'Immunity', 'Immunization', 'Leukemia, B-Cell/immunology/*prevention & control', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/immunology/*prevention & control', 'Membrane Proteins/isolation & purification/therapeutic use', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Molecular Chaperones/isolation & purification/*therapeutic use', 'Ribonucleoproteins/isolation & purification/therapeutic use', 'Survival Analysis', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2000/03/31 09:00,2000/06/03 09:00,['2000/03/31 09:00'],"['2000/03/31 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/06/03 09:00 [medline]', '2000/03/31 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2000 Mar;6(3):909-15.,"['0 (Calcium-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Calreticulin)', '0 (Cancer Vaccines)', '0 (HSP70 Heat-Shock Proteins)', '0 (HSP90 Heat-Shock Proteins)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Molecular Chaperones)', '0 (Ribonucleoproteins)', '0 (glucose-regulated proteins)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the functional significance of these variations in textural features remains sometimes unclear. Several drugs have been shown to be able to modulate chromatin structure. Among them, the phosphatase inhibitor okadaic acid at low concentration can increase accessibility to DNA in chromatin of carcinoma cells. This paper demonstrates that short exposures (0-3 h) to a 10-nM dose of okadaic acid induced an increased sensitivity to DNase I digestion in human CEM leukaemic cell nuclei and that this sensitization was associated to variations of nuclear texture characteristics, as evaluated by image cytometry. CEM cells treated with okadaic acid for 0-3h displayed changes in chromatin supraorganization with a more homogeneous and fine chromatin texture, as compared to control cells. This suggests that the appearance of an open configuration of chromatin structure as evaluated by biochemical methods corresponds to a more decondensed texture of nuclei measured by image cytometry. Longer exposures (6-24h) of CEM cells to 10 nM okadaic acid lead to apoptosis. As reported previously for camptothecin-treated HL60 cells, okadaic acid-treated CEM cells display biphasic nuclear chromatin texture changes, i.e. a decondensation phase followed by the appearance of typical apoptotic cells with a smaller nuclear area and a highly condensed chromatin. Finally, using the multidrug-resistant CEM-VLB cell line, it was confirmed that these multidrug-resistant cells also display cross-resistance to okadaic acid, as this compound was unable to induce either increased DNase I sensitivity, apoptosis, or altered nuclear texture in this particular cell line.","['Yatouji, S', 'Liautaud-Roger, F', 'Dufer, J']","['Yatouji S', 'Liautaud-Roger F', 'Dufer J']","['Unite Median, Faculte de Pharmacie, Universite de Reims, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Cell Prolif,Cell proliferation,9105195,IM,"['Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Chromatin/*chemistry/*drug effects', 'Deoxyribonuclease I/*pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance, Multiple', 'Humans', 'Image Cytometry', 'Leukemia/drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Okadaic Acid/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2000/03/31 09:00,2000/04/15 09:00,['2000/03/31 09:00'],"['2000/03/31 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/04/15 09:00 [medline]', '2000/03/31 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1046/j.1365-2184.2000.00163.x [doi]'],ppublish,Cell Prolif. 2000 Feb;33(1):51-62. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2184.2000.00163.x.,"['0 (Chromatin)', '1W21G5Q4N2 (Okadaic Acid)', 'EC 3.1.21.1 (Deoxyribonuclease I)']",,PMC6496830,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The current study evaluated patterns of infection and 100-day transplant-related mortality in 288 patients with myelodysplasia and leukemia transplanted without isolation. Patients were allowed out of hospital at any time within constraints of the medication schedule. Fever, foci of infection, and positive cultures within 28 days and death within 100 days because of the transplant procedure were recorded. Fever occurred in 57% of patients, and 10% had a clinical or radiographic focus of infection. Most infections were apparently endogenous; blood cultures from 24% of recipients grew organisms, 87% of which were gram-positive bacteria. Four patients (1%) died with aspergillus infection in circumstances indicating that isolation would not have been helpful. Twenty percent of patients remained without evidence of infection throughout. Transplant-related mortality at 100 days was 1% for 108 patients with early leukemia receiving transplants from matched siblings. For patients at higher risk, by virtue of donor and/or disease status, mortality was 21%. These figures compare favorably with those reported to the International Bone Marrow Transplant Registry, the majority of patients having been subjected to some form of isolation.

These findings suggest that the flow cytometry is of adjunctive importance in making a diagnosis of the lymphoma.","['Kaneita, Y', 'Yasukawa, K', 'Kura, Y', 'Yamazaki, T', 'Sawada, U']","['Kaneita Y', 'Yasukawa K', 'Kura Y', 'Yamazaki T', 'Sawada U']","['First Department of Internal Medicine, Nihon University School of Medicine.']",['jpn'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",Japan,Nihon Rinsho,Nihon rinsho.

Reversible chemical reactions showing Scatchard-type binding are exemplified by CO, CN- and cyclodiene neurotoxin insecticide intoxications, and by antigen-antibody complex formation. Haemoglobin (Hb) molecular biology accounts for the allosteric co-operativity and other characteristics of CO poisoning, CN- acts as a powerful cytochrome oxidase inhibitor, and antigen binding in a deep antibody cleft between two domains equipped with epitopes for antigen-binding groups explains hapten-specific immune reactions. Covalent chemical reactions with second-order (SN2) kinetics characterize Hg and Cd poisonings, the reactions of organophosphates and phosphonates with acetylcholinesterase and neurotoxic esterase and the reaction sequence whereby Paraquat accepts electrons and generates superoxide under aerobic conditions. Indirect carcinogens require cytochrome P450 activation to form DNA adducts in target-organ DNA and cause cancer, but a battery of detoxifying enzymes clustered with the P450 system must be overcome. Thus, S-metabolism competes ineffectively with target DNA for reactive vinyl chloride (VC) metabolites, epoxide hydrolase is important to the metabolism and carcinogenicity of alfatoxins and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (benzo[a]pyrene, etc.), and the non-toxic 2-naphthylhydroxylamine N-glucuronide acts as a transport form in 2-naphthylamine bladder cancer. VC liver-cancer pathogenesis is explicable in terms of the presence of the glutathione S-transferase detoxifying system in hepatocytes and its absence from the fibroblastic elements, and of the VC concentrations reaching the liver by different administrative routes. In VC carcinogenicity, chemical reactions give imidazo-cyclization products with nucleoside residues of target DNA, and in benzene leukaemia, Z,Z-muconaldehyde forms cyclic products containing a pyrrole residue linked to purine. Increased HbCO concentrations reduce the O2-carrying capacity of the blood, and the changed shape of the O2-Hb dissociation curve parallels disturbance in O2 unloading. CN- acts on electron transport and paralyses respiration. In telodrin poisoning, preconvulsive glutamine formation abstracts tricarboxylic acid intermediates incommensurately with normal cerebral respiration. Antigen-antibody complexing depletes the antibody titre, available against infection. At high doses of Cd, Cd-thionein filtered through the kidneys is reabsorbed and tubular lesions produced. Some organophosphate insecticides promote irreversible acetylcholinesterase phosphorylation and blockade nerve function, and others react with neurotoxic esterase to cause delayed neuropathy. The evidence for Paraquat pulmonary poisoning suggests a radical mechanism involving three interrelated cyclic reaction stages. The action of N- and O8 (O substituent in 6-position of the purine) demethylases explains deletion mechanisms for DNA-alkyl adducts. DNA-directed synthesis in the presence of ultimate carcinogens provides for an estimation of misincorporations, which implicate the same transversions as those found by direct mutagenicity testing. Chemical carcinogens recognize tissue-sensitive cells and modify their heritable genetic complement. Oncoproteins encoded by activated oncogenes signal the transformation of normal cells into cancer cells. The importance of the H-ras oncogene and p53 tumour-suppressor gene is stressed. Antidotal action is analysed; for example, parenteral glutamine administration to telodrin-intoxicated rats restores the depleted cerebral glutamate level and prevents seizures. Glutamate acts as anticonvulsant in petit mal epilepsy. In general, therefore, the reaction of the toxicant-related substance with the relevant target-tissue macromolecule accounts for the biochemical/biological events at a cellular level a","['Hathway, D E']",['Hathway DE'],"['Hatfield College, University of Durham.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Biol Rev Camb Philos Soc,Biological reviews of the Cambridge Philosophical Society,0414576,IM,"['Animals', 'Humans', 'Models, Chemical', '*Poisoning', '*Toxicology']",2000/03/31 09:00,2000/05/20 09:00,['2000/03/31 09:00'],"['2000/03/31 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/05/20 09:00 [medline]', '2000/03/31 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1017/s0006323199005447 [doi]'],ppublish,Biol Rev Camb Philos Soc. 2000 Feb;75(1):95-127. doi: 10.1017/s0006323199005447.,,298,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

HTLV-I encodes a 40 kDa phosphoprotein, Tax, which has been implicated in cellular transformation. In similarity with several other oncoproteins such as Myc, Jun, and Fos, Tax is a transcriptional activator. How Tax mechanistically dysregulates the cell cycle remains unclear. Recent findings from us and others have shown that Tax targets key regulators of G1/S and M progression such as p16INK4a, cyclin D1, cyclin D3-cdk, and the mitotic spindle checkpoint apparatus. Thus, Tax influences the progression of cells in various phases of the cell cycle. In this regard, we will discuss three distinct mechanisms through which Tax affects cell-cycling: a) through direct association Tax can abrogate the inhibitory function of p16INK4a on the G1-cdks, b) Tax can also directly influence cyclin D-cdk activities by a protein-protein interaction, and c) Tax targets the HsMAD1 mitotic spindle-assembly checkpoint protein. Through these varied routes, the HTLV-I oncoprotein dysregulates cellular growth controls and engenders a proclivity of cells toward a loss of DNA-damage surveillance.","['Neuveut, C', 'Jeang, K T']","['Neuveut C', 'Jeang KT']","['Laboratoire de Recombinaison et Expression Genetique, Institut Pasteur, Paris, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",France,Prog Cell Cycle Res,Progress in cell cycle research,9609058,IM,"['Animals', 'Carrier Proteins/metabolism', 'Cell Cycle/*physiology', 'Cyclin D1/metabolism', 'Cyclin D3', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p16', 'Cyclins/metabolism', 'Gene Products, tax/*metabolism', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Mitosis/physiology', 'Signal Transduction/physiology']",2000/03/31 09:00,2000/06/17 09:00,['2000/03/31 09:00'],"['2000/03/31 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/06/17 09:00 [medline]', '2000/03/31 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/978-1-4615-4253-7_14 [doi]'],ppublish,Prog Cell Cycle Res. 2000;4:157-62. doi: 10.1007/978-1-4615-4253-7_14.,"['0 (CCND3 protein, human)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Cyclin D3)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p16)', '0 (Cyclins)', '0 (Gene Products, tax)', '136601-57-5 (Cyclin D1)']",83,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
