A new family of cell-survival regulators expressed in lymphocytes, termed immune-associated nucleotide-binding proteins (IANs) [also known as GTPase of immunity-associated proteins (GIMAPs)], has been described. The IAN/GIMAP family consists of GTP-binding proteins that share a unique primary structure and whose expression is finely regulated by T-cell receptor signals. Recent studies have shown that IAN/GIMAP family proteins crucially regulate the survival of T cells during development, selection and homeostasis, and are possibly linked to the onset of T-lymphopenia, leukemia and autoimmunity. IAN/GIMAP family proteins might also take part in mitochondrial regulation of lymphocyte apoptosis by interacting with Bcl-2 family proteins.","['Nitta, Takeshi', 'Takahama, Yousuke']","['Nitta T', 'Takahama Y']","['Division of Experimental Immunology, Institute for Genome Research, University of Tokushima, 3-18-15 Kuramoto, Tokushima 770-8503, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20061228,England,Trends Immunol,Trends in immunology,100966032,"['0 (Antigens)', '0 (Receptors, Immunologic)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (GTP-Binding Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens/immunology', 'Cell Survival', 'GTP-Binding Proteins/classification/genetics/*metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Humans', 'Lymphocytes/*cytology/immunology/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Immunologic/immunology']",66,2007/01/02 09:00,2007/04/20 09:00,['2007/01/02 09:00'],"['2006/09/19 00:00 [received]', '2006/11/13 00:00 [revised]', '2006/12/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/01/02 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/04/20 09:00 [medline]', '2007/01/02 09:00 [entrez]']","['S1471-4906(06)00331-0 [pii]', '10.1016/j.it.2006.12.002 [doi]']",ppublish,Trends Immunol. 2007 Feb;28(2):58-65. doi: 10.1016/j.it.2006.12.002.

METHODS: Seventy-nine children were enrolled in this study; they received 1-4 courses of chemotherapy. MTX was administered at a dose of 5 g/m2. MTX population parameters were estimated from 61 patients (231 courses; age range: 2-16 years). The data were analyzed by nonlinear mixed-effect modeling with use of a two-compartment structural model. The interoccasion variability was taken into account in the model. Eighteen additional patients (70 courses) were used to evaluate the predictive performances of the Bayesian approach and to devise a limited sampling strategy. RESULTS: The following population parameters were obtained: total clearance (CL) = 8.8 l/h (inter-individual variability: 43%), initial volume of distribution (V1) = 17.3 l (48%), k12 = 0.0225 h(-1) (41%), and k21 = 0.0629 h(-1) (24%). The inter-individual variability in the initial volume of distribution was partially explained by the fact that this parameter was weight-dependent. Intercourse variability was limited, with a mean variation of 13.2%. The protocol involving two sampling times, 24 and 48 h after the beginning of infusion, allows precise and accurate determination of individual pharmacokinetic parameters and consequently, it was possible to predict the time at which the MTX concentration reached the predicted threshold (0.2 microM) below which the administration of folinic acid could be stopped. CONCLUSION: The results of this study combine the relationships between the pharmacokinetic parameters of MTX and patient covariates that may be useful for dose adjustment, with a convenient sampling procedure that may aid in optimizing pediatric patient care.","['Plard, Christine', 'Bressolle, Francoise', 'Fakhoury, May', 'Zhang, Daolun', 'Yacouben, Karina', 'Rieutord, Andre', 'Jacqz-Aigrain, Evelyne']","['Plard C', 'Bressolle F', 'Fakhoury M', 'Zhang D', 'Yacouben K', 'Rieutord A', 'Jacqz-Aigrain E']","['Department of Paediatric Pharmacology and Pharmacogenetics, Robert Debre Hospital, Paris, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Validation Study']",20061229,Germany,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol,Cancer chemotherapy and pharmacology,7806519,['YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Bayes Theorem', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Methotrexate/*pharmacokinetics', 'Models, Theoretical', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/*metabolism', 'Sampling Studies']",,2006/12/30 09:00,2007/09/20 09:00,['2006/12/30 09:00'],"['2006/07/10 00:00 [received]', '2006/11/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2006/12/30 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/09/20 09:00 [medline]', '2006/12/30 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s00280-006-0394-3 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol. 2007 Sep;60(4):609-20. doi: 10.1007/s00280-006-0394-3.

This randomized trial compared three options of postremission therapy: chemotherapy and allogeneic or autologous stem-cell transplantation (SCT). PATIENTS AND METHODS: All 106 VHR-ALL patients received induction with five drugs followed by intensification with three cycles of chemotherapy. Patients in complete remission (CR) with an HLA-identical family donor were assigned to allogeneic SCT (n = 24) and the remaining were randomly assigned to autologous SCT (n = 38) or to delayed intensification followed by maintenance chemotherapy up to 2 years in CR (n = 38). RESULTS: Overall, 100 patients achieved CR (94%). With a median follow-up of 6.5 years, 5-year disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) probabilities were 45% (95% CI, 37% to 54%) and 48% (95% CI, 40% to 57%), respectively. The three groups were comparable in the main pretreatment ALL characteristics. Intention-to-treat analysis showed no differences for donor versus no donor in DFS (45%; 95% CI, 27% to 65% v 45%; 95% CI, 37% to 55%) and OS (48%; 95% CI, 30% to 67% v 51%; 95% CI, 43% to 61%), as well as for autologous SCT versus chemotherapy comparisons (DFS: 44%; 95% CI, 29% to 60% v 46%; 95% CI, 32% to 62%; OS: 45%; 95% CI, 31% to 62% v 57%; 95% CI, 43% to 73%). No differences were found within the different subgroups of ALL and neither were differences observed when the analysis was made by treatment actually performed. CONCLUSION: This study failed to prove that, when a family donor is available, allogeneic SCT produces a better outcome than autologous SCT or chemotherapy in children with VHR-ALL.","['Ribera, Jose-Maria', 'Ortega, Juan-Jose', 'Oriol, Albert', 'Bastida, Pilar', 'Calvo, Carlota', 'Perez-Hurtado, Jose-Maria', 'Gonzalez-Valentin, Maria-Elvira', 'Martin-Reina, Victoria', 'Molines, Antonio', 'Ortega-Rivas, Fernando', 'Moreno, Maria-Jose', 'Rivas, Concepcion', 'Egurbide, Izaskun', 'Heras, Inmaculada', 'Poderos, Concepcion', 'Martinez-Revuelta, Eva', 'Guinea, Jose-Maria', 'del Potro, Eloy', 'Deben, Guillermo']","['Ribera JM', 'Ortega JJ', 'Oriol A', 'Bastida P', 'Calvo C', 'Perez-Hurtado JM', 'Gonzalez-Valentin ME', 'Martin-Reina V', 'Molines A', 'Ortega-Rivas F', 'Moreno MJ', 'Rivas C', 'Egurbide I', 'Heras I', 'Poderos C', 'Martinez-Revuelta E', 'Guinea JM', 'del Potro E', 'Deben G']","[""Servicio de Hematologia Clinica, Institut Catala d'Oncologia-Hospital Universitari Germans Trias i Pujol, Badalona, Spain. jribera@iconcologia.net""]",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*therapy', 'Remission Induction', 'Risk', 'Stem Cell Transplantation/*methods', 'Transplantation, Autologous', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Treatment Outcome']",,2006/12/30 09:00,2007/01/30 09:00,['2006/12/30 09:00'],"['2006/12/30 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/01/30 09:00 [medline]', '2006/12/30 09:00 [entrez]']","['25/1/16 [pii]', '10.1200/JCO.2006.06.8312 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2007 Jan 1;25(1):16-24. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2006.06.8312.,,['J Clin Oncol. 2007 Jun 20;25(18):2625-6; author reply 2627-8.

Expression of GABPalpha was restricted to undifferentiated ES cells and controlled by STAT3. We found that the expression level of Oct-3/4 is reduced by knockdown of GABPalpha. On the other hand, GABPalpha-overexpressing ES cells maintained the expression level of Oct-3/4 even in the absence of LIF. Moreover, the induction of Oct-3/4 repressors Cdx-2, Coup-tf1, and GCNF was stimulated by GABPalpha knockdown. These data suggest that GABPalpha upregulates the expression of Oct-3/4 via downregulation of Oct-3/4 repressors.","['Kinoshita, Keita', 'Ura, Hiroki', 'Akagi, Tadayuki', 'Usuda, Masayuki', 'Koide, Hiroshi', 'Yokota, Takashi']","['Kinoshita K', 'Ura H', 'Akagi T', 'Usuda M', 'Koide H', 'Yokota T']","['Department of Stem Cell Biology, Graduate School of Medical Science, Kanazawa University, 13-1 Takara-machi, Kanazawa, Ishikawa 920-8640, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20061219,United States,Biochem Biophys Res Commun,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,0372516,"['0 (GA-Binding Protein Transcription Factor)', '0 (Gabpa protein, mouse)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Octamer Transcription Factor-3)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Stat3 protein, mouse)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Down-Regulation/drug effects', 'Embryonic Stem Cells/*physiology', 'GA-Binding Protein Transcription Factor/*physiology', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/physiology', 'Mice', 'Octamer Transcription Factor-3/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'RNA Interference', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor/genetics/physiology', 'Up-Regulation']",,2006/12/30 09:00,2007/03/14 09:00,['2006/12/30 09:00'],"['2006/11/22 00:00 [received]', '2006/12/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2006/12/30 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/03/14 09:00 [medline]', '2006/12/30 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-291X(06)02745-8 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bbrc.2006.12.071 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Biophys Res Commun. 2007 Feb 16;353(3):686-91. doi: 10.1016/j.bbrc.2006.12.071.

OBJECTIVES: To describe the neoplasms diagnosed and treated in newborns (</= 28 days of life) in the Hospital Universitario de Canarias and their association with congenital abnormalities and to evaluate prenatal diagnosis of these tumors. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The medical records of patients with neoplasms diagnosed during the neonatal period in the previous 25 years in our hospital were retrospectively reviewed. The variables analyzed were the percentage of neonatal neoplasms among the total number of cancer cases in children aged less than 14 years, their incidence among all the newborns in our hospital, sex, year of diagnosis, age at clinical diagnosis, the presence or absence of prenatal diagnosis, type of tumor (histologic diagnosis), association with syndromes or other congenital anomalies, treatment, and long-term outcome. RESULTS: Of 260 neoplasms diagnosed in our unit from 1980, 16 (6.1 %) were diagnosed in the neonatal period. The incidence of neonatal neoplasms was estimated to be 276.5 per million live births. Males accounted for 43.8 % and females for 56.2 %, with a mean age at diagnosis of 5.5 days (range 1-28 days). Five neonates (31.2 %) had a prenatal diagnosis, 60 % of which were made in the last 7 years of the study period. A further five newborns were diagnosed at the initial neonatal examination. Histologic diagnoses were neuroblastoma (n = 5; 31.2 %), teratoma/ germ cell tumor (n = 4; 25 %), soft tissue sarcoma (one fibrosarcoma of the thigh and two hemangiopericytoma of the back and heart; 18.8 %), and one case each of mesoblastic nephroma, cerebral tumor (ependymoblastoma), melanoma (associated with giant congenital melanocytic nevi), and acute leukemia (associated with Down syndrome). Treatment consisted of surgery alone (n = 10; 62.5 %) and surgery plus chemotherapy (n = 5; 31.2 %); one patient received no treatment. The overall actuarial survival rate was 87.5 %. Sequelae were observed in 33.3 % of survivors. CONCLUSIONS: The neoplasms most frequently diagnosed in the neonatal period were solid tumors, mainly neuroblastoma and teratomas/germ cell tumors; 12.5 % were associated with syndromes or congenital anomalies. In the last 7 years, the prenatal diagnosis of these entities has improved. Most of the neoplasms responded to therapy, mainly surgery, and long-term outcome was favorable.","['Lopez Almaraz, R', 'Villafruela Alvarez, C', 'Rodriguez Luis, J', 'Domenech Martinez, E']","['Lopez Almaraz R', 'Villafruela Alvarez C', 'Rodriguez Luis J', 'Domenech Martinez E']","['Servicio de Pediatria, Unidad de Oncohematologia Pediatrica, Hospital Universitario de Canarias, La Laguna, Tenerife, Espana.']",['spa'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",,Spain,An Pediatr (Barc),"Anales de pediatria (Barcelona, Spain : 2003)",101162596,,IM,"['Female', 'Humans', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Male', '*Neoplasms/diagnosis/epidemiology/therapy', 'Retrospective Studies']",,2006/12/30 09:00,2007/05/26 09:00,['2006/12/30 09:00'],"['2006/12/30 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/05/26 09:00 [medline]', '2006/12/30 09:00 [entrez]']","['13095844 [pii]', '10.1157/13095844 [doi]']",ppublish,An Pediatr (Barc). 2006 Dec;65(6):529-35. doi: 10.1157/13095844.,,['An Pediatr (Barc). 2007 Jul;67(1):85-6.

This was performed in cells that were synchronized by nocodazole and treated with TPA in the presence of a protein synthesis inhibitor, cycloheximide, to prevent activation of secondary targets and therefore increase the probability of early transcripts in total RNA pool. The expression alteration was analyzed by microarray and the selection criteria of candidate genes were adjusted by real-time PCR validation to increase its reliability. Finally, 56 genes were identified as early TPA-responsive genes in this multiscreening step approach. Furthermore, upregulation of three candidate genes (NFIL3, SKIL, and JMJD3) was shown to be dosage and time dependent with TPA treatment and was found to be directly regulated by TPA through PKC-dependent signaling.

In this regard, GISTs may coexist with different types of cancer, either synchronously or metachronously. The frequency of this association and the spectrum of neoplasms involved have not been sufficiently analyzed. We conducted a review of the literature and our own records for cases with sporadic GISTs and other malignancies, with emphasis on solid tumors. Neurofibromatosis 1 and Carney triad-associated tumors were excluded. Based on these data, there were 518 cancers in 486 GIST patients among 4813 cases with informative data. The overall frequency of second tumors in different series varied from 4.5% to 33% (mean, 13%). A total of 29 patients had multiple malignancies. GISTs of gastric location were most commonly involved with other neoplasms, reflecting their overall high frequency (60%) of all GISTs. The major types of GIST-associated cancers were gastrointestinal carcinomas (n=228; 47%), lymphoma/leukemia, (n=36; 7%), and carcinomas of prostate (n=43; 9%), breast (n=34; 7%), kidney (n=27; 6%), lung (n=26; 5%), female genital tract (n=25; 5%), and carcinoid tumors (n=13; 3%). Other cancers included soft tissue and bone sarcomas (n=15; 3%), malignant melanoma (n=12; 2%), and seminoma (n=6; 1%). Occurrence of collision tumors and metastases of carcinoma or sarcoma into a GIST (the latter noted in 4 cases) can be challenging diagnostic problems.

The mechanism underlying this resistance to cell death is still largely unknown. Tumour necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) effectively kills tumour cells but not normal cells, and thus represents an attractive tool for the treatment of cancer. Unfortunately, lymphocytes from B-CLL patients are resistant to TRAIL-mediated apoptosis. Thus, we aimed to study the involvement of PED, a DED-family member with a broad antiapoptotic action, in this resistance. We demonstrate that B lymphocytes obtained from patients with B-CLL express high levels of PED. Treatment of B-CLL cells with specific PED antisense oligonucleotides, a protein synthesis inhibitor or HDAC inhibitors, induced a significant downregulation of PED and sensitized these cells to TRAIL-induced cell death. These findings suggest a direct involvement of PED in resistance to TRAIL-induced apoptosis in B-CLL. It also identifies this DED-family member as a potential therapeutic target for this form of leukaemia.","['Garofalo, Michela', 'Romano, Giulia', 'Quintavalle, Cristina', 'Romano, Maria Fiammetta', 'Chiurazzi, Federico', 'Zanca, Ciro', 'Condorelli, Gerolama']","['Garofalo M', 'Romano G', 'Quintavalle C', 'Romano MF', 'Chiurazzi F', 'Zanca C', 'Condorelli G']","['Department of Cellular and Molecular Biology and Pathology, University of Naples Federico II, Via Pansini 5, 80131-Naples, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,"['0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Oligonucleotides, Antisense)', '0 (PEA15 protein, human)', '0 (Phosphoproteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand)']",IM,"['*Apoptosis', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins', 'Down-Regulation', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Enzyme Inhibitors', 'Female', 'Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors', 'Humans', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/genetics/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Oligonucleotides, Antisense/pharmacology', 'Phosphoproteins/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis/metabolism', 'TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand/*pharmacology']",,2006/12/29 09:00,2007/04/25 09:00,['2006/12/29 09:00'],"['2006/12/29 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/04/25 09:00 [medline]', '2006/12/29 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ijc.22495 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Cancer. 2007 Mar 15;120(6):1215-22. doi: 10.1002/ijc.22495.,['Int J Cancer. 2019 Mar 1;144(5):E1.

These alloreactions are predicted by the absence of recipient HLA class I ligands for donor inhibitory killer Ig-like receptors (KIR). We hypothesized that donor NK cell alloreactions against recipient cells may affect the development of T and B-cell functions and incidence of GVHD in infants with severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID). Of the 156 patients with SCID who had received related bone marrow transplants without pretransplant chemotherapy or posttransplant GVHD prophylaxis, 137 patient-donor pairs were evaluated for the absence of recipient HLA class I ligands for donor inhibitory KIR. Analysis showed that the absence of a KIR ligand had no effect on the incidence or severity of GVHD (RR [corrected] = 0.95, p = 0.84), development of T-cell function (RR [corrected] = 1.05, p = 0.69), production of IgA (p = 0.46) or IgM (p = 0.33), or on 5-year survival (RR [corrected] = 1.21, p = 0.10). Further, in patients possessing native NK cells, the absence of KIR ligands in donors for recipient-inhibitory KIR did not alter transplantation outcomes.

A limitation of these vectors, however, is the difficulty in generating stable vector producer cell (VPC) lines when the vectors encode cytotoxic proteins. We developed a series of Moloney murine leukemia virus-based vectors encoding a reverse transcription-activated transgene. These vectors preclude gene expression in the producer cells, yet allow lines for transgene expression in target cells. The vectors were generated by cloning the gene of interest in reverse orientation either just upstream of the viral 3' long terminal repeat (LTR) or in the U3 region of the 3'LTR. An exogenous promoter was inserted, also in reverse orientation, at the R-U5 border of the viral 5'LTR. Upon transduction of target cells, the inserted promoter is copied to the 3'LTR during reverse transcription of the vector genomic RNA, where it then drives transgene expression. We tested this system using a green fluorescent protein (GFP) gene and the SV40 promoter. Reverse transcription-activated retroviral vectors may allow for the generation of stable retroviral VPC lines encoding cytotoxic or inhibitory genes.","['Burke, John Douglas', 'Morris, John C']","['Burke JD', 'Morris JC']","['Metabolism Branch, Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20061226,United States,Mol Ther,Molecular therapy : the journal of the American Society of Gene Therapy,100890581,"['0 (RNA, Messenger)']",IM,"['Cell Line', 'Gene Expression/*genetics', 'Gene Silencing', 'Genes, Reporter/genetics', 'Genetic Vectors/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Retroviridae/*genetics', 'Reverse Transcription/*genetics', 'Transgenes/*genetics']",,2006/12/28 09:00,2008/04/02 09:00,['2006/12/28 09:00'],"['2006/12/28 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/04/02 09:00 [medline]', '2006/12/28 09:00 [entrez]']","['S1525-0016(16)31315-6 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.mt.6300062 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Ther. 2007 Mar;15(3):552-9. doi: 10.1038/sj.mt.6300062.

Although it was considered to be a poor prognostic disease, modern treatment protocols (aggressive chemotherapy and prophylactic cranial irradiation) have resulted in dramatically improved survival rates. In a group of low-risk ALL patients, the 5-year survival rate is estimated to be 85%. However, ALL patients who undergo this treatment are at risk of developing secondary neoplasms related to treatment, which has become an increasingly recognized problem. CASE DESCRIPTION: A 3-year-old boy with ALL was successfully treated with chemotherapy (vincristine, prednisolone, mercaptopurine and methotrexate) and prophylactic cranial irradiation (total 18 Gy). At the age of 23, he was admitted to our hospital for weakness in the right leg. Computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging revealed a parasagittal tumor of the left frontoparietal lobe with perifocal edema. The tumor was completely removed surgically and pathohistologically diagnosed as atypical meningioma. CONCLUSION: Long-term survivors who received radiotherapy for ALL in childhood are at risk for late complications, including radiation-induced meningioma. Therefore, careful follow-up neurological examinations, for example magnetic resonance imaging, are indicated in these patients. In addition, late complications should be taken into account during the initial planning of prophylactic radiotheraphy dosage, which has implications for informed consent of the patient.","['Kawahara, Ichiro', 'Masui, Kenta', 'Horie, Nobutaka', 'Matsuo, Takayuki', 'Kitagawa, Naoki', 'Tsutsumi, Keisuke', 'Nagata, Izumi', 'Morikawa, Minoru', 'Hayashi, Tomayoshi']","['Kawahara I', 'Masui K', 'Horie N', 'Matsuo T', 'Kitagawa N', 'Tsutsumi K', 'Nagata I', 'Morikawa M', 'Hayashi T']","['Department of Neurosurgery, Nagasaki University School of Medicine, Nagasaki-City, Nagasaki, Japan. i-kwhr@umin.ac.jp']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",,Switzerland,Pediatr Neurosurg,Pediatric neurosurgery,9114967,,IM,"['Adult', 'Child, Preschool', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Meningeal Neoplasms/*diagnosis/*etiology/surgery', 'Meningioma/*diagnosis/*etiology/surgery', 'Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced/*diagnosis/surgery', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*radiotherapy', 'Radiotherapy/adverse effects', 'Time Factors']",,2006/12/28 09:00,2007/03/17 09:00,['2006/12/28 09:00'],"['2005/09/21 00:00 [received]', '2006/02/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2006/12/28 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/03/17 09:00 [medline]', '2006/12/28 09:00 [entrez]']","['000097524 [pii]', '10.1159/000097524 [doi]']",ppublish,Pediatr Neurosurg. 2007;43(1):36-41. doi: 10.1159/000097524.,,,,,,"['Copyright (c) 2007 S.

When overexpressed in mice, APRIL induces B-cell neoplasia, reminiscent of human B-cell chronic lymphoid leukemia (B-CLL). We analyzed APRIL expression in situ in human non-Hodgkin lymphomas. APRIL up-regulation was only observed in high-grade B-cell lymphomas, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), and Burkitt lymphoma (BL). Up-regulation was seen in 46% and 20% of DLBCL and BL, respectively. In DLBCL, neutrophils, constitutively producing APRIL and infiltrating the tumor tissue, were the main cellular source of APRIL. Rare DLBCL cases showed a predominance of histiocytes or mesenchymal cells as APRIL source. APRIL secreted by neutrophils accumulated on tumor cells via proteoglycan binding. In addition to proteoglycans, DLBCL tumor cells expressed the APRIL signaling receptor, TACI and/or BCMA, indicating that these tumor cells are fully equipped to respond to APRIL. A retrospective clinical analysis revealed a significant correlation between high expression of APRIL in tumor lesions and decreased overall patient survival rate. Hence, APRIL produced by inflammatory cells infiltrating lymphoma lesions may increase tumor aggressiveness and affect disease outcome.","['Schwaller, Juerg', 'Schneider, Pascal', 'Mhawech-Fauceglia, Paulette', 'McKee, Thomas', 'Myit, Samir', 'Matthes, Thomas', 'Tschopp, Jurg', 'Donze, Olivier', 'Le Gal, Frederique-Anne', 'Huard, Bertrand']","['Schwaller J', 'Schneider P', 'Mhawech-Fauceglia P', 'McKee T', 'Myit S', 'Matthes T', 'Tschopp J', 'Donze O', 'Le Gal FA', 'Huard B']","['Department of Research, University Hospital, Basel, Switzerland.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (B-Cell Maturation Antigen)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proteoglycans)', '0 (TNFRSF13B protein, human)', '0 (TNFRSF17 protein, human)', '0 (TNFSF13 protein, human)', '0 (Transmembrane Activator and CAML Interactor Protein)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor Ligand Superfamily Member 13)']",IM,"['B-Cell Maturation Antigen/metabolism', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/*metabolism/mortality/pathology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/*metabolism/mortality/pathology', 'Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse/*metabolism/mortality/pathology', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/*metabolism/mortality/pathology', 'Neoplasm Invasiveness', 'Neoplasm Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics/*physiology', 'Neutrophils/*metabolism', 'Prognosis', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Proteoglycans/*metabolism', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Analysis', 'Transmembrane Activator and CAML Interactor Protein/metabolism', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor Ligand Superfamily Member 13/biosynthesis/genetics/*physiology', 'Up-Regulation']",,2006/12/28 09:00,2007/02/21 09:00,['2006/12/28 09:00'],"['2006/12/28 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/02/21 09:00 [medline]', '2006/12/28 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)52161-7 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2006-02-001800 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2007 Jan 1;109(1):331-8. doi: 10.1182/blood-2006-02-001800.,['Blood. 2007 Sep 1;110(5):1474'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

CASE SUMMARY: In the first case, a 74-year-old male diagnosed with Philadelphia chromosome-positive (Ph+) chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), treated with imatinib 400 mg/day, developed a skin eruption with a livedoid pattern. Systemic corticosteroids were started, and skin lesions improved. The second case involved a 66-year-old male with Ph+ CML who was treated with imatinib 600 mg/day. After initiation of this treatment, he developed a skin rash with a livedoid pattern. The drug treatment was discontinued and then reintroduced. Topical corticosteroid treatment was started, resulting in total remission of the skin lesions. When the imatinib dose was progressively reintroduced, the skin lesions recurred. The patient died as a result of the progression of his disease. In the third case, a 43-year-old male with Ph+ acute lymphoblastic leukemia was treated with imatinib 600 mg/day. After a few days of treatment, the patient developed a skin rash with a livedoid pattern. He died as a result of probable septic shock. DISCUSSION: Imatinib is a tyrosine kinase receptor inhibitor that inhibits BCR/ABL tyrosine kinase. There have been several published articles on cutaneous adverse reactions related to imatinib therapy. The most common cutaneous adverse event of imatinib is a rash with variable clinical presentation. The Naranjo probability scale indicated a probable relationship between imatinib and the rash in all 3 cases reported here. CONCLUSIONS: Adverse reactions to imatinib that affect the skin occur frequently. They are strongly dose dependent, self-limiting, or easily managed by lowering the dose of imatinib and, if necessary, prescribing short-term therapy with a systemic corticosteroid. Clinicians should monitor patients taking imatinib and institute treatment quickly if a rash develops.","['Martinez-Gonzalez, M Covadonga', 'del Pozo, Jesus', 'Yebra-Pimentel, Maria Teresa', 'Perez, Monica', 'Almagro, Manuel', 'Fonseca, Eduardo']","['Martinez-Gonzalez MC', 'del Pozo J', 'Yebra-Pimentel MT', 'Perez M', 'Almagro M', 'Fonseca E']","['Dermatology Department, Juan Canalejo Hospital, A Coruna, Spain. covadie@yahoo.es']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",20061226,United States,Ann Pharmacother,The Annals of pharmacotherapy,9203131,"['0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Benzamides', 'Drug Eruptions/diagnosis/pathology', 'Exanthema/*chemically induced/diagnosis/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Male', 'Piperazines/*adverse effects', 'Pyrimidines/*adverse effects']",,2006/12/28 09:00,2007/03/24 09:00,['2006/12/28 09:00'],"['2006/12/28 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/03/24 09:00 [medline]', '2006/12/28 09:00 [entrez]']","['aph.1H304 [pii]', '10.1345/aph.1H304 [doi]']",ppublish,Ann Pharmacother. 2007 Jan;41(1):148-52. doi: 10.1345/aph.1H304.

Our aim was to study the microbiological changes in the oral cavity of children with newly diagnosed cancer. The study group consisted of 30 consecutive children and adolescents, 16 with acute lymphoblastic leukemia and 14 with solid tumors. Oral cultures to detect fungi and bacteria were conducted for all patients before treatment, during and after neutropenic episodes. In 23 patients developing fever simultaneous throat, urine and blood sampling was carried out. No pathogens were found in the cultures taken before the outset (30 cultures) or after recovery from (30 cultures) the neutropenic episodes. In the 45 oral cultures taken during the neutropenic episodes 38 (84.4%) proved positive. Fungi were the most frequently isolated oral pathogens: 33/38 yeast and 6/38 bacterial infections were identified. There was no association between the underlying malignancy and the occurrence of the positive cultures. Of the 30 patients, all 23 (76.7%) who have developed moderate-to-severe neutropenia, developed oral fungal colonization or clinically obvious fungal infection at least on one occasion during the study. In addition to oral samples, fungi were identified in 9/23 pharyngeal swabs, 6/23 urine and 1/23 blood cultures. The initial fungal pathogen was exclusively (33/33) Candida albicans. In extended severe neutropenic states, C. albicans was replaced by non-albicans species (C. kefyr, C. lusitaniae, C. sake, C. tropicalis) in 5 patients between 4 to 6 days of the neutropenic episodes. Four of the nonalbicans Candida strains were resistant to azole-type antifungal agents. Neutropenic episodes of children with cancer are associated with an increased risk of developing oral and even systemic infections with C. albicans that can be replaced by azole-resistant nonalbicans strains in prolonged neutropenia contributing to morbidity of these patients.","['Alberth, Marta', 'Majoros, Laszlo', 'Kovalecz, Gabriella', 'Borbas, Emese', 'Szegedi, Istvan', 'J Marton, Ildiko', 'Kiss, Csongor']","['Alberth M', 'Majoros L', 'Kovalecz G', 'Borbas E', 'Szegedi I', 'J Marton I', 'Kiss C']","['Faculty of Dentistry, Medical and Health Science Center, University of Debrecen, Debrecen, Hungary.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20061225,Switzerland,Pathol Oncol Res,Pathology oncology research : POR,9706087,['0 (Antifungal Agents)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antifungal Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Candida albicans/drug effects/pathogenicity', 'Candidiasis, Oral/drug therapy/*etiology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Drug Resistance, Microbial', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Microbial Sensitivity Tests', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*complications/drug therapy', 'Risk Factors']",,2006/12/27 09:00,2007/03/30 09:00,['2006/12/27 09:00'],"['2006/05/05 00:00 [received]', '2006/09/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2006/12/27 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/03/30 09:00 [medline]', '2006/12/27 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF02893420 [doi]'],ppublish,Pathol Oncol Res. 2006;12(4):237-41. doi: 10.1007/BF02893420.

This study aims to validate a new measure of looming, the looming cancer, and explore its clinical correlates in a chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) cohort. METHODS: In a cross-sectional design, 105 CLL patients completed the Looming Cancer Scale, Looming Cognitive Style Questionnaire (LCSQ), SF-36, Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI) and Beck Depression Inventory II (BDI-II). RESULTS: Exploratory factor analysis reduced the 20-item Looming Cancer Scale to a 10-item version, which demonstrated good psychometric properties (Cronbach's alpha=.926). Convergent validity was demonstrated by Pearson correlation with the LCSQ (0.418), BAI (0.380), BDI-II (0.336) and the mental component score of the SF-36 (-0.434) (all P<.001). Divergent validity was demonstrated by a lack of correlation with the SF-36 physical component score and cross tabulation frequencies of high and low loomers. High vs. low loomers showed significantly more anxiety (31% vs. 13%), depression (23% vs. 2%) and mixed anxiety-depression (18% vs. 2%). An area under the receiver operating characteristic curve analysis revealed high sensitivity (82%) and specificity (69%) in detecting mixed anxiety-depression using a cutoff score of >/=20/30. CONCLUSIONS: The Looming Cancer Scale is a valid measurement of looming cognitive style and is the first time that the looming construct has been studied in a cancer cohort. The importance of this research lies in its potential to identify populations vulnerable to developing anxiety, depression and mixed anxiety-depression symptoms.","['Levin, Tomer T', 'Riskind, John H', 'Li, Yuelin']","['Levin TT', 'Riskind JH', 'Li Y']","['Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY 10022, USA. levint@mskcc.org']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Gen Hosp Psychiatry,General hospital psychiatry,7905527,,IM,"['Adult', '*Affect', 'Anxiety Disorders/diagnosis/epidemiology', '*Cognition', 'Demography', 'Depressive Disorder, Major/diagnosis/*epidemiology/*etiology', 'Factor Analysis, Statistical', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*epidemiology/*psychology', 'Male', 'Psychometrics/statistics & numerical data', 'Surveys and Questionnaires']",,2006/12/27 09:00,2007/03/03 09:00,['2006/12/27 09:00'],"['2006/06/09 00:00 [received]', '2006/10/04 00:00 [revised]', '2006/10/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2006/12/27 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/03/03 09:00 [medline]', '2006/12/27 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0163-8343(06)00177-0 [pii]', '10.1016/j.genhosppsych.2006.10.005 [doi]']",ppublish,Gen Hosp Psychiatry. 2007 Jan-Feb;29(1):32-8. doi: 10.1016/j.genhosppsych.2006.10.005.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Among these compounds, 1-benzyl-3-(5-hydroxymethyl-2-furyl)-5-methylfuro[3,2-c]pyrazole (1) showed more potency than YC-1. Through investigation of action mechanism, it was found that compound 1 induced terminal differentiation of HL-60 cells toward granulocyte lineage and promoted HL-60 cell differentiation by regulation of Bcl-2 and c-Myc proteins. Meanwhile, compound 1 also demonstrated apoptosis inducing effect. Such anti-leukemia mechanism of action is apparently different from that of YC-1 which mainly works by inducing apoptosis, but not cell differentiation. Therefore, compound 1 is identified here as a new lead compound of cell differentiating agent and apoptosis inducer for further development of new anti-leukemia agents.","['Chou, Li-Chen', 'Huang, Li-Jiau', 'Yang, Jai-Sing', 'Lee, Fang-Yu', 'Teng, Che-Ming', 'Kuo, Sheng-Chu']","['Chou LC', 'Huang LJ', 'Yang JS', 'Lee FY', 'Teng CM', 'Kuo SC']","['Graduate Institute of Pharmaceutical Chemistry, China Medical University, Taichung, Taiwan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20061206,England,Bioorg Med Chem,Bioorganic & medicinal chemistry,9413298,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Indazoles)', '0 (MYC protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc)', '0 (Pyrazoles)', ""154453-18-6 (3-(5'-hydroxymethyl-2'-furyl)-1-benzylindazole)""]",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*chemical synthesis/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Granulocytes', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Indazoles', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc', 'Pyrazoles/chemical synthesis/*pharmacology']",,2006/12/27 09:00,2007/04/04 09:00,['2006/12/27 09:00'],"['2006/09/01 00:00 [received]', '2006/12/01 00:00 [revised]', '2006/12/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2006/12/27 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/04/04 09:00 [medline]', '2006/12/27 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0968-0896(06)00987-4 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bmc.2006.12.001 [doi]']",ppublish,Bioorg Med Chem. 2007 Feb 15;15(4):1732-40. doi: 10.1016/j.bmc.2006.12.001.

SUMMARY: A 23-year-old white male patient was originally admitted to receive intravenous chemotherapy for acute myelogenous leukemia. He had a history of intravenous amphetamine abuse, hepatitis B virus infection, hepatitis C virus infection, depression, and bipolar disorder. The patient's routine medications before admission included methadone, fluoxetine, voriconazole, transdermal nicotine patch, lorazepam, and quetiapine. The patient developed persistent neutropenia and complications from chemotherapy, including mild mucositis. Despite treatment with levofloxacin, acyclovir, and voriconazole, the patient developed high fevers. Levofloxacin was discontinued and aztreonam and vancomycin were started. After a blood culture revealed that the bacteria were likely vancomycin resistant, vancomycin was discontinued and linezolid was initiated. Nine hours later, the patient began complaining of severe pain in his abdomen. After a total of four doses of linezolid, the patient reported further discomfort. Two days after linezolid initiation, a health care team member identified the interaction between fluoxetine and linezolid as the cause of the patient's symptoms, and linezolid was discontinued. All symptoms resolved within 48 hours. While resolution generally occurs within 24-48 hours after discontinuing the offending agent, the time to resolution may be delayed if the agent has a long half-life or active metabolites, in which case admission to an intensive care unit is recommended. Cyproheptadine and chlorpromazine may also be used to treat symptoms. CONCLUSION: Serotonin syndrome developed in a patient taking concurrent linezolid and fluoxetine.","['Steinberg, Michael', 'Morin, Anna K']","['Steinberg M', 'Morin AK']","['Massachusetts College of Pharmacy and Health Sciences, Worcester, Massachusetts 01608, USA. michael.steinberg@wor.mcphs.edu']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",,England,Am J Health Syst Pharm,American journal of health-system pharmacy : AJHP : official journal of the American Society of Health-System Pharmacists,9503023,"['0 (Acetamides)', '0 (Anti-Infective Agents)', '0 (Oxazolidinones)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', 'ISQ9I6J12J (Linezolid)', 'XB4K113EL0 (fluoxydine)']",IM,"['Acetamides/administration & dosage/*adverse effects/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Adult', 'Anti-Infective Agents/administration & dosage/*adverse effects/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Drug Interactions', 'Drug Therapy, Combination', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy', 'Linezolid', 'Male', 'Oxazolidinones/administration & dosage/*adverse effects/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Pyrimidines/administration & dosage/*adverse effects/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Serotonin Syndrome/*chemically induced/physiopathology', 'United States']",,2006/12/26 09:00,2007/05/11 09:00,['2006/12/26 09:00'],"['2006/12/26 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/05/11 09:00 [medline]', '2006/12/26 09:00 [entrez]']","['64/1/59 [pii]', '10.2146/ajhp060227 [doi]']",ppublish,Am J Health Syst Pharm. 2007 Jan 1;64(1):59-62. doi: 10.2146/ajhp060227.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The aim of this study was to apply a modified reverse immunology strategy to identify immunogenic epitopes of WT1 which could be useful for immunotherapy. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Potential HLA-A*01 epitopes predicted by a MHC binding algorithm were screened for recognition by peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from patients with spontaneous T cell responses using intracellular cytokine cytometry. Epitope processing was shown by proteasomal cleavage. Epitope-specific T cells were generated from CD4+CD25+ regulatory T cell-depleted PBMC. RESULTS: One of five predicted HLA-A*01-binding candidate epitopes showed high immunogenicity as 5 of 14 patients with hematologic malignancies had WT1.317-327-reactive T cells ranging from 0.4% to 1.5% of CD3+CD8+ T cells. Proteasomal degradation assays indicated the cleavage of WT1.317-327. The depletion of regulatory T cells from PBMCs enabled the rapid expansion of WT1.317-327-specific CTL, whereas no CTL could be generated from unfractionated PBMC. WT1.317-327-specific CTL efficiently lysed an autologous WT1-expressing tumor cell line but not HLA-A*01-negative WT1-expressing tumor cells. Immunogenicity of the epitope across histologies was verified by the demonstration of spontaneous ex vivo WT1.317-327-specific T cell responses in two of six patients with HLA-A*01-positive melanoma or lung cancer. CONCLUSION: In this study, a modified reverse immunology strategy was employed to identify a first immunogenic HLA-A*01-restricted T cell epitope of the tumor antigen WT1, which is of considerable interest for use in vaccination trials.","['Asemissen, Anne Marie', 'Keilholz, Ulrich', 'Tenzer, Stefan', 'Muller, Margret', 'Walter, Steffen', 'Stevanovic, Stefan', 'Schild, Hansjorg', 'Letsch, Anne', 'Thiel, Eckhard', 'Rammensee, Hans-Georg', 'Scheibenbogen, Carmen']","['Asemissen AM', 'Keilholz U', 'Tenzer S', 'Muller M', 'Walter S', 'Stevanovic S', 'Schild H', 'Letsch A', 'Thiel E', 'Rammensee HG', 'Scheibenbogen C']","['Medizinische Klinik III, Hematology, Oncology, and Transfusion Medicine, Charite Campus Benjamin Franklin, Berlin, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,"['0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Epitopes, T-Lymphocyte)', '0 (HLA-A Antigens)', '0 (HLA-A1 Antigen)', '0 (Peptide Fragments)', '0 (WT1 Proteins)', 'EC 3.4.25.1 (Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex)']",IM,"['Antigens, Neoplasm/isolation & purification', 'Carcinoma/immunology', 'Epitopes, T-Lymphocyte/*isolation & purification/*metabolism', 'HLA-A Antigens/*metabolism', 'HLA-A1 Antigen', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/immunology', 'Leukocytes/immunology', 'Lung Neoplasms/immunology', 'Lymphocyte Activation/physiology', 'Melanoma/immunology', 'Peptide Fragments/immunology/metabolism', 'Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex/metabolism', 'Protein Binding', 'Skin Neoplasms/immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/immunology', 'WT1 Proteins/*immunology/metabolism']",,2006/12/26 09:00,2007/03/16 09:00,['2006/12/26 09:00'],"['2006/12/26 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/03/16 09:00 [medline]', '2006/12/26 09:00 [entrez]']","['12/24/7476 [pii]', '10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-06-1337 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2006 Dec 15;12(24):7476-82. doi: 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-06-1337.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Using denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography and sequencing, we screened for ABL kinase domain mutations in 370 Ph+ patients with evidence of hematologic or cytogenetic resistance to imatinib. RESULTS: Mutations were found in 127 of 297 (43%) evaluable patients. Mutations were found in 27% of chronic-phase patients (14% treated with imatinib frontline; 31% treated with imatinib post-IFN failure), 52% of accelerated-phase patients, 75% of myeloid blast crisis patients, and 83% of lymphoid blast crisis/Ph+ acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) patients. Mutations were associated in 30% of patients with primary resistance (44% hematologic and 28% cytogenetic) and in 57% of patients with acquired resistance (23% patients who lost cytogenetic response; 55% patients who lost hematologic response; and 87% patients who progressed to accelerated phase/blast crisis). P-loop and T315I mutations were particularly frequent in advanced-phase chronic myeloid leukemia and Ph+ ALL patients, and often accompanied progression from chronic phase to accelerated phase/blast crisis. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that (a) amino acid substitutions at seven residues (M244V, G250E, Y253F/H, E255K/V, T315I, M351T, and F359V) account for 85% of all resistance-associated mutations; (b) the search for mutations is important both in case of imatinib failure and in case of loss of response at the hematologic or cytogenetic level; (c) advanced-phase chronic myeloid leukemia and Ph+ ALL patients have a higher likelihood of developing imatinib-resistant mutations; and (d) the presence of either P-loop or T315I mutations in imatinib-treated patients should warn the clinician to reconsider the therapeutic strategy.","['Soverini, Simona', 'Colarossi, Sabrina', 'Gnani, Alessandra', 'Rosti, Gianantonio', 'Castagnetti, Fausto', 'Poerio, Angela', 'Iacobucci, Ilaria', 'Amabile, Marilina', 'Abruzzese, Elisabetta', 'Orlandi, Ester', 'Radaelli, Franca', 'Ciccone, Fabrizio', 'Tiribelli, Mario', 'di Lorenzo, Roberto', 'Caracciolo, Clementina', 'Izzo, Barbara', 'Pane, Fabrizio', 'Saglio, Giuseppe', 'Baccarani, Michele', 'Martinelli, Giovanni']","['Soverini S', 'Colarossi S', 'Gnani A', 'Rosti G', 'Castagnetti F', 'Poerio A', 'Iacobucci I', 'Amabile M', 'Abruzzese E', 'Orlandi E', 'Radaelli F', 'Ciccone F', 'Tiribelli M', 'di Lorenzo R', 'Caracciolo C', 'Izzo B', 'Pane F', 'Saglio G', 'Baccarani M', 'Martinelli G']","['Department of Hematology/Oncology L. and A.

Tie2 receptor tyrosine kinase is a specific endothelial cell receptor whose function is positively regulated by angiopoietin 1 (Ang1). Recently, Tie2 has also been found in the nonvascular compartment of several tumors, including leukemia as well as breast, gastric, and thyroid cancers. There is, however, little information on the function of the Ang1/Tie2 pathway in the non-stromal cells within human tumors. We found that surgical glioblastoma specimens contained a subpopulation of Tie2+/CD31- and Tie2+/GFAP+ cells, suggesting that Tie2 is indeed expressed outside the vascular compartment of gliomas. Furthermore, analysis of a tissue array consisting of 116 human glioma samples showed that Tie2 expression in the neoplastic glial cells was significantly associated with progression from a lower to higher grade. Importantly, Ang1 stimulation of Tie2+ glioma cells resulted in increased adherence of the cells to collagen I and IV, suggesting that Tie2 regulates glioma cell adhesion to the extracellular matrix. Conversely, the down-regulation of Tie2 levels by small interference RNA or the addition of soluble Tie2 abrogated the Ang1-mediated effect on cell adhesion. In studying the expression of cell adhesion molecules, we found that Tie2 activation was related to the up-regulation of integrin beta1 levels and the formation of focal adhesions. These results, together with the reported fact that malignant gliomas express high levels of Ang1, suggest the existence of an autocrine loop in malignant gliomas and that a Tie2-dependent pathway modulates cell-to-extracellular matrix adhesion, providing new insights into the highly infiltrative phenotype of human gliomas.","['Lee, Ok-Hee', 'Xu, Jing', 'Fueyo, Juan', 'Fuller, Gregory N', 'Aldape, Kenneth D', 'Alonso, Marta M', 'Piao, Yuji', 'Liu, Ta-Jen', 'Lang, Frederick F', 'Bekele, B Nebiyou', 'Gomez-Manzano, Candelaria']","['Lee OH', 'Xu J', 'Fueyo J', 'Fuller GN', 'Aldape KD', 'Alonso MM', 'Piao Y', 'Liu TJ', 'Lang FF', 'Bekele BN', 'Gomez-Manzano C']","['Department of Neuro-Oncology, The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Mol Cancer Res,Molecular cancer research : MCR,101150042,"['0 (Integrin beta1)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor, TIE-2)']",IM,"['Cell Adhesion/*physiology', 'Extracellular Matrix/*physiology', 'Gene Expression', 'Glioma/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Integrin beta1/*physiology', 'Neovascularization, Pathologic', 'Neuroglia/*metabolism', 'Receptor, TIE-2/genetics/*metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,2006/12/26 09:00,2007/01/24 09:00,['2006/12/26 09:00'],"['2006/12/26 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/01/24 09:00 [medline]', '2006/12/26 09:00 [entrez]']","['4/12/915 [pii]', '10.1158/1541-7786.MCR-06-0184 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Cancer Res. 2006 Dec;4(12):915-26. doi: 10.1158/1541-7786.MCR-06-0184.,,,,,,,['CA-93127/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,

Mice with null mutation in IRF-8 are defective in the ability of myeloid progenitor cells to mature toward macrophage lineage. Accordingly, these mice develop chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML). We demonstrate here that IRF-8 is an obligatory regulator of the promyelocytic leukemia (PML) gene in activated macrophages, leading to the expression of the PML-I isoform. This regulation is most effective together with two other transcription factors, IRF-1 and PU.1. PML is a tumor suppressor gene that serves as a scaffold protein for nuclear bodies. IRF-8 is not only essential for the IFN-gamma-induced expression of PML in activated macrophages but also for the formation of nuclear bodies. Reduced IRF-8 transcript levels were reported in CML patients, and a recovery to normal levels was observed in patients in remission following treatment with IFN-alpha. We demonstrate a significant correlation between the levels of IRF-8 and PML in these CML patients. Together, our results indicate that some of the myeloleukemia suppressor activities of IRF-8 are mediated through the regulation of PML. When IRF-8 levels are compromised, the reduced PML expression may lead to genome instability and eventually to the leukemic phenotype.","['Dror, Natalie', 'Rave-Harel, Naama', 'Burchert, Andreas', 'Azriel, Aviva', 'Tamura, Tomohiko', 'Tailor, Prafullakumar', 'Neubauer, Andreas', 'Ozato, Keiko', 'Levi, Ben-Zion']","['Dror N', 'Rave-Harel N', 'Burchert A', 'Azriel A', 'Tamura T', 'Tailor P', 'Neubauer A', 'Ozato K', 'Levi BZ']","['Department of Biotechnology and Food Engineering, Technion-Israel Institute of Technology, Haifa 32000, Israel.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20061222,United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Interferon Regulatory Factor-1)', '0 (Interferon Regulatory Factors)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Pml protein, mouse)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (Protein Isoforms)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '0 (interferon regulatory factor-8)', '0 (proto-oncogene protein Spi-1)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Female', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/genetics', '*Genomic Instability/genetics', 'Humans', 'Interferon Regulatory Factor-1/genetics/metabolism', 'Interferon Regulatory Factors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Intranuclear Inclusion Bodies/genetics/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Macrophages/metabolism/pathology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Mutant Strains', 'Myeloid Progenitor Cells/*metabolism/pathology', 'NIH 3T3 Cells', 'Neoplasm Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Nuclear Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'Protein Isoforms', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Trans-Activators/genetics/metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics']",,2006/12/26 09:00,2007/04/18 09:00,['2006/12/26 09:00'],"['2006/12/26 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/04/18 09:00 [medline]', '2006/12/26 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0021-9258(20)68859-7 [pii]', '10.1074/jbc.M607825200 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2007 Feb 23;282(8):5633-40. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M607825200.

However, leukemia patients after SCT are usually immunocompromised and immunologically tolerant to leukemia cells. We investigated whether the use of dendritic cells (DCs) in combination with HSP70 enhances cytotoxicity against B-cell leukemia cell line A20 in mice after syngeneic SCT. All unimmunized mice died of leukemia early after A20 cell inoculation, whereas mice immunized with HSP70 or HSP70-pulsed DCs survived significantly longer. Although only 60% of the HSP70-immunized mice survived, all mice immunized with HSP70-pulsed DCs survived without MRD. In addition, the cytotoxicities against A20 cells for splenocytes from mice immunized with HSP70-pulsed DCs were significantly higher than those of HSP70-immunized mice, and the cytotoxicities against A20 cells were significantly blocked by anti-CD8 antibody and by major histocompatibility complex class I antibody, but not by anti-CD4 antibody. Moreover, abnormalities were detected in neither the biochemical data nor the histopathologic findings. These findings indicate that the combined use of DCs and leukemia cell-derived HSP70 enhances the antileukemia effect by inducing the specific cytotoxicities of CD8+ cytotoxic T-cells, thereby eradicating MRD effectively and safely, even in an immunocompromised state after syngeneic SCT. This approach may thus be useful for further application of HSP in leukemia patients after autologous SCT.","['Iuchi, Yasuyuki', 'Torimoto, Yoshihiro', 'Sato, Kazuya', 'Tamura, Yasuaki', 'Jimbo, Junko', 'Inamura, Junki', 'Shindo, Motohiro', 'Ikuta, Katsuya', 'Ohnishi, Kouhei', 'Kohgo, Yutaka']","['Iuchi Y', 'Torimoto Y', 'Sato K', 'Tamura Y', 'Jimbo J', 'Inamura J', 'Shindo M', 'Ikuta K', 'Ohnishi K', 'Kohgo Y']","['Division of Gastroenterology and Hematology/Oncology, Department of Medicine Asahikawa Medical College, Asahikawa, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",,Japan,Int J Hematol,International journal of hematology,9111627,"['0 (Cancer Vaccines)', '0 (HSP70 Heat-Shock Proteins)', '0 (Histocompatibility Antigens Class I)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Cancer Vaccines/*immunology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Dendritic Cells/*immunology/transplantation', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Female', 'HSP70 Heat-Shock Proteins/*immunology', 'Histocompatibility Antigens Class I/immunology', 'Immunity, Cellular', 'Leukemia, B-Cell/immunology/*therapy', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*immunology', 'Neoplasm, Residual', '*Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Transplantation, Autologous', 'Transplantation, Isogeneic', 'Vaccination']",,2006/12/26 09:00,2007/02/22 09:00,['2006/12/26 09:00'],"['2006/12/26 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/02/22 09:00 [medline]', '2006/12/26 09:00 [entrez]']","['3642952514171182 [pii]', '10.1532/IJH97.06003 [doi]']",ppublish,Int J Hematol. 2006 Dec;84(5):449-58. doi: 10.1532/IJH97.06003.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Fourteen months after CBT, the patient developed pancytopenia and hepatic dysfunction with persistent high-grade fever. The bone marrow was hypocellular with increased numbers of macrophages and hemophagocytes. The numbers of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) copies in peripheral blood samples were remarkably high. Although the patient showed complete donor-type hematopoiesis, the titer of viral capsid antigen immunoglobulin G was low, and the results of a test for EBV nuclear antigen were negative. There was no clinical response to the reduction of immunosuppressive therapy or to the administration of high-dose methylprednisolone, human immunoglobulin, or acyclovir. The patient died 466 days after CBT of massive gastrointestinal hemorrhage due to bone marrow and hepatic failures.

Nineteen patients were evaluated every 2 to 4 weeks, and their levels of JunB expression before therapy were significantly decreased compared with those of healthy individuals. After imatinib therapy, an increase in JunB expression was found in 5 patients, all of whom achieved a complete cytogenetic response (CCR) and molecular response (MR), with a decrease in BCR-ABL expression. JunB expression decreased to a very low level in 2 patients, both of whom showed progression to blast crisis. Variable JunB expression was found in the other 12 patients, and their outcomes were mostly driven by BCR-ABL levels. The patients with an increase in JunB expression were statistically more likely to achieve a major cytogenetic response (P = .045), CCR (P = .033), and MR (P = .033) than the group with no increase in JunB expression, and a durable response was observed.

Although she attained complete remission (CR) immediately after induction therapy, the disease recurred 1 year after the completion of consolidation therapies. She underwent HLA-matched unrelated allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (UBMT), together with a myeloablative conditioning regimen, after achieving a second CR and has survived without a recurrence for more than 24 months since UBMT. In general, certain secondary chromosomal abnormalities are associated with the phenotype of the disease, which retains its essential biologic characteristics established by the primary abnormality. Accordingly, the primary nature of the leukemic cells in this case differs from the findings for core-binding factor AML with inv(16)(p13q22). We believe this report is the first of de novo AMML Eo with t(5; 17)(q13;q11) showing as a secondary chromosomal aberration with inv(16)(p13q22).","['Sakai, Rika', 'Fujimaki, Katsumichi', 'Yamazaki, Etsuko', 'Sakamoto, Hiroshi', 'Kanamori, Heiwa', 'Miura, Ikuo', 'Ishigatsubo, Yoshiaki']","['Sakai R', 'Fujimaki K', 'Yamazaki E', 'Sakamoto H', 'Kanamori H', 'Miura I', 'Ishigatsubo Y']","['Department of Hematology and Immunology, Fujisawa City Hospital, Fujisawa Department of Hematology, Kanagawa Cancer Center, Yokohama, Japan. sakarika@kcch.jp']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",,Japan,Int J Hematol,International journal of hematology,9111627,,IM,"['Adult', 'Bone Marrow Cells/*pathology', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', '*Chromosome Inversion', 'Chromosomes, Human/*genetics', 'Eosinophils/*pathology', 'Female', 'Humans', '*Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Acute/genetics/pathology/therapy', 'Recurrence', 'Remission Induction', '*Translocation, Genetic', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",,2006/12/26 09:00,2007/02/22 09:00,['2006/12/26 09:00'],"['2006/12/26 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/02/22 09:00 [medline]', '2006/12/26 09:00 [entrez]']","['0477474167715N24 [pii]', '10.1532/IJH97.06054 [doi]']",ppublish,Int J Hematol. 2006 Dec;84(5):417-20. doi: 10.1532/IJH97.06054.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

She was treated with low-dose prednisolone. In January 2005, she experienced left hip joint pain, and magnetic resonance scanning showed a tumoral lesion in the femoral head. Histological diagnosis of the biopsied mass revealed that it was a granulocytic sarcoma, and radiotherapy was performed. In April 2005, bone scintigraphy showed multiple lesions. She became febrile and red blood cell transfusion-dependent with hepatosplenomegaly and a small number of circulating blasts.

We report our experience in treating VRE BSI in febrile, neutropenic patients with daptomycin, a recently licensed lipopeptide with bactericidal activity against VRE. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with fever, neutropenia and VRE BSI were treated with more than one dose of daptomycin (either 6 mg/kg/day or 4 mg/kg/day) in an open label, emergency-use trial. Patients were then assessed for clinical and microbiological cures and survival. MIC's of isolates to daptomycin were determined. RESULTS: Nine febrile, neutropenic patients with VRE BSI received daptomycin. Four of 9 courses (44%) had clinical and/or microbiologic cure. Two of the 5 who failed cure died within 3 days of initiation of daptomycin. Five subjects survived to 30 days after the onset of BSI. CONCLUSIONS: Use of daptomycin in neutropenic patients with VRE BSI deserves further study as a treatment for VRE BSI in neutropenic patients.","['Poutsiaka, Debra D', 'Skiffington, Serena', 'Miller, Kenneth B', 'Hadley, Susan', 'Snydman, David R']","['Poutsiaka DD', 'Skiffington S', 'Miller KB', 'Hadley S', 'Snydman DR']","['Division of Geographic Medicine and Infectious Diseases, Box 041, Tufts-New England Medical Center, 750 Washington Street, Boston, MA 02111, USA. dpoutsiaka@tufts-nemc.org <dpoutsiaka@tufts-nemc.org>']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20061226,England,J Infect,The Journal of infection,7908424,"['0 (Anti-Bacterial Agents)', 'NWQ5N31VKK (Daptomycin)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Bacteremia/complications/*drug therapy', 'Daptomycin/*therapeutic use', 'Enterococcus faecium/isolation & purification/*pathogenicity', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/surgery', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/surgery', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neutropenia/*complications', 'Stem Cell Transplantation', '*Vancomycin Resistance']",,2006/12/26 09:00,2007/06/01 09:00,['2006/12/26 09:00'],"['2006/08/29 00:00 [received]', '2006/10/30 00:00 [revised]', '2006/11/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2006/12/26 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/06/01 09:00 [medline]', '2006/12/26 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0163-4453(06)00389-6 [pii]', '10.1016/j.jinf.2006.11.007 [doi]']",ppublish,J Infect. 2007 Jun;54(6):567-71. doi: 10.1016/j.jinf.2006.11.007.

Non-radioactive methods e.g. MTT, Hoechst 22147 staining, have also been used. Though CRA has the benefit of being reproducible, it has several drawbacks e.g. spontaneous release and radioactivity. The basic strategy of this new flow cytometric assay involves labeling target cells with DIOC18, in addition to staining with propidium iodide to identify dead cells. 8-week-old human MCs were used as effectors. Human LAK-sensitive K-562; and LAK-resistant myeloid leukemia cell lines (DAMI, HL-60 and Meg-01) as well as 6 LAK-resistant myeloid leukemia patient samples were utilized. MCs/targets were co-incubated in certain ratios for short/long-term. Although there was some insignificant killing at 2 h/18 h, probably due to small sample size, significant killing in Meg-01 and HL-60 cells (27% and 39%; respectively) was observed at 48 h.

DESIGN: Retrospective small case series. PARTICIPANTS: Three patients who underwent HSCT and 4 age- and gender-matched controls for cytokine analysis in ocular fluid. METHODS: Interventional study of patients who underwent HSCT. Screening for evidence of infectious causes and immunological analysis of ocular fluid samples. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Clinical features of uveitis and results of aqueous analysis. RESULTS: Anterior uveitis developed during an exacerbation of chronic GVHD in 3 patients after allogeneic HSCT for hematologic malignancies. Patients exhibited no abnormalities on extensive uveitis screening, and in addition, serologic and wide-ranging aqueous analysis showed no evidence of recent infections. We observed signs of inflammation in the ocular fluid in 2 of 3 patients by the determination of different cytokines. No other explanation for uveitis was found except the exacerbation of GVHD. Treatment, both systemic and topical, directed to chronic GVHD induced remission of uveitis in all patients along with amelioration of other signs of GVHD.

Currently, the most effective treatment of CML is the inhibition of Bcr-Abl activity by imatinib mesylate (Gleevec). Imatinib efficacy is limited by development of resistance through either expression of Bcr-Abl variants that bind imatinib less avidly, increased expression of Bcr-Abl, or expression of multidrug transport proteins. N-Benzyladriamycin-14-valerate (AD 198) is a novel antitumor PKC activating agent that triggers rapid apoptosis through PKC-delta activation and mitochondrial depolarization in a manner that is unaffected by Bcl-2 expression. We demonstrate that Bcr-Abl expression does not confer resistance to AD 198. Further, AD 198 rapidly induces Erk1/2 and STAT5 phosphorylation prior to cytochrome c release from mitochondria, indicating that proliferative pathways are active even as drug-treated cells undergo apoptosis. At sub-cytotoxic doses, AD 198 and its cellular metabolite, N-benzyladriamycin (AD 288) sensitize CML cells to imatinib through a supra-additive reduction in the level of Bcr-Abl protein expression. These results suggest that AD 198 is an effective treatment for CML both in combination with imatinib and alone against imatinib-resistant CML cells.","['Lothstein, Leonard', 'Savranskaya, Luydmila', 'Sweatman, Trevor W']","['Lothstein L', 'Savranskaya L', 'Sweatman TW']","['Department of Pharmacology and The UT Cancer Institute, The University of Tennessee Health Science Center, Memphis, TN 38163, USA. llothstein@utmem.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20061221,England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,"['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (STAT5 Transcription Factor)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', '9007-43-6 (Cytochromes c)', '98983-21-2 (N-benzyladriamycin-14-valerate)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 3)']",IM,"['Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/*therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Benzamides', 'Cytochromes c/metabolism', 'Doxorubicin/analogs & derivatives/therapeutic use', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Drug Synergism', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/genetics/*metabolism', 'HL-60 Cells/drug effects/metabolism/pathology', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Immunoblotting', 'K562 Cells/drug effects/metabolism/pathology', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1/metabolism', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 3/metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Piperazines/*therapeutic use', 'Protein Kinase C/metabolism', 'Pyrimidines/*therapeutic use', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'STAT5 Transcription Factor/metabolism']",,2006/12/26 09:00,2007/08/23 09:00,['2006/12/26 09:00'],"['2006/08/07 00:00 [received]', '2006/10/26 00:00 [revised]', '2006/11/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2006/12/26 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/08/23 09:00 [medline]', '2006/12/26 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0145-2126(06)00446-2 [pii]', '10.1016/j.leukres.2006.11.003 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 2007 Aug;31(8):1085-95. doi: 10.1016/j.leukres.2006.11.003.

Leg pain was accompanied by a numbness and muscle weakness which was clearly assigned to the L5 dermatome.

One day after admission of the patient to the hospital a typical zoster exanthema involving the L5 dermatome appeared. Varicella-zoster virus (VZV) was detected in the fluid of the vesicular skin lesions by polymerase chain reaction. Intravenous administration of aciclovir lead to rapid decrease of pain and exanthema. A few months later the patient died because of an acute myeloid leukemia as a complication of the known osteomyelofibrosis. This case report shows that a herpes zoster infection can imitate a radicular spine syndrome usually caused by degenerative changes. Especially in immunocompromised patients, a zoster radiculitis should be included in the differential diagnosis of radiculopathy.

UnSUMOylated Tr2 activates Oct4, enhancing embryonal carcinoma-cell proliferation, and is localized to the promyelocytic leukemia (Pml) nuclear bodies. When its abundance is elevated, Tr2 is SUMOylated at Lys238 and seems to be released from the nuclear bodies to act as a repressor. SUMOylation of Tr2 induces an exchange of its coregulators: corepressor Rip140 replaces coactivator Pcaf, which switches Tr2 from an activator to a repressor. This involves dynamic partitioning of Tr2 into Pml-containing and Pml-free pools. These results support a model where SUMOylation-dependent partitioning and differential coregulator recruitment contribute to the maintenance of a homeostatic supply of activating, as opposed to repressive, Tr2, thus fine-tuning Oct4 expression and regulating stem-cell proliferation.","['Park, Sung Wook', 'Hu, Xinli', 'Gupta, Pawan', 'Lin, Ya-Ping', 'Ha, Sung Gil', 'Wei, Li-Na']","['Park SW', 'Hu X', 'Gupta P', 'Lin YP', 'Ha SG', 'Wei LN']","['Department of Pharmacology, University of Minnesota Medical School, Minneapolis, Minnesota 55455, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20061224,United States,Nat Struct Mol Biol,Nature structural & molecular biology,101186374,"['0 (Nr2c1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Nuclear Receptor Subfamily 2, Group C, Member 1)', '0 (Octamer Transcription Factor-3)', '0 (Pias1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Pou5f1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Protein Inhibitors of Activated STAT)', '0 (Receptors, Thyroid Hormone)', '0 (Small Ubiquitin-Related Modifier Proteins)', 'EC 2.3.2.23 (Ubiquitin-Conjugating Enzymes)', 'EC 6.3.2.- (ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme UBC9)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Nucleus Structures/*metabolism', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Embryonal Carcinoma Stem Cells', 'Mice', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/cytology', 'Nuclear Receptor Subfamily 2, Group C, Member 1', 'Octamer Transcription Factor-3/*genetics', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Protein Inhibitors of Activated STAT/metabolism', 'Receptors, Thyroid Hormone/*metabolism', 'Small Ubiquitin-Related Modifier Proteins/*metabolism', 'Stem Cells/*cytology/metabolism', 'Ubiquitin-Conjugating Enzymes/metabolism']",,2006/12/26 09:00,2007/03/09 09:00,['2006/12/26 09:00'],"['2006/05/06 00:00 [received]', '2006/11/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2006/12/26 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/03/09 09:00 [medline]', '2006/12/26 09:00 [entrez]']","['nsmb1185 [pii]', '10.1038/nsmb1185 [doi]']",ppublish,Nat Struct Mol Biol. 2007 Jan;14(1):68-75. doi: 10.1038/nsmb1185.

Published case reports describe a diversity of clinical presentations with confusing terminology and diagnostic criteria as a consequence of the assumption that MRD in cats are analogous to those in dogs or humans. OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to describe clinical, clinicopathologic and imaging findings, response to treatment, survival and possible associations with other diseases or vaccination in a large case series. A priori hypotheses were that cats with MRD commonly present with extramedullary involvement and uncommonly have radiographic bone lesions, in contrast to human patients. ANIMALS: Twenty-four cats with MRD confirmed by cytology or histopathology and immunohistochemistry. METHOD: A multicenter retrospective study was performed. RESULTS: Two types of clinical presentation were observed. The first group (n = 17) had neoplasia involving abdominal organs, bone marrow, or both. All developed systemic clinical signs and paraproteinemia. Five of 7 cats that received chemotherapy improved clinically or had decreased serum globulin concentration (median survival, 12.3 months; range, 8.5-22 months). The second group comprised 7 cats with skin masses, 2 of which were paraproteinemic and developed rapidly worsening systemic signs. In cats without systemic signs, excision of the skin masses appeared to be associated with prolonged survival (up to 2.4 years). Cats with MRD commonly presented with extramedullary involvement (67%), versus humans with MRD (5%) (P < .001), and uncommonly presented with radiographic bone lesions (8%) versus humans with MRD (80%) (P < .001). CONCLUSIONS: Radiographic bone lesions are uncommon in cats with MRD and extramedullary presentation is common, relative to human myeloma.","['Mellor, Paul J', 'Haugland, Sean', 'Murphy, Sue', 'Smith, Ken C', 'Holloway, Andrew', 'Archer, Joy', 'Powell, Roger M', 'Polton, Gerry A', 'Tasker, Severine', 'McCormick, David', 'Tempest, Michelle E', 'McNeil, Pauline E', 'Scase, Timothy J', 'Knott, Chris D', 'Bonfanti, Ugo', 'Villiers, Elizabeth J', 'Argyle, David J', 'Herrtage, Michael E', 'Day, Michael J']","['Mellor PJ', 'Haugland S', 'Murphy S', 'Smith KC', 'Holloway A', 'Archer J', 'Powell RM', 'Polton GA', 'Tasker S', 'McCormick D', 'Tempest ME', 'McNeil PE', 'Scase TJ', 'Knott CD', 'Bonfanti U', 'Villiers EJ', 'Argyle DJ', 'Herrtage ME', 'Day MJ']","['Department of Veterinary Medicine, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK. p.j.mellor.02@cantab.net']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,J Vet Intern Med,Journal of veterinary internal medicine,8708660,,IM,"['Animals', 'Bone and Bones/diagnostic imaging/pathology', 'Cat Diseases/*diagnosis/pathology', 'Cats', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Dogs', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Multiple Myeloma/diagnosis/pathology/*veterinary', 'Organ Specificity', 'Radiography', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Sarcoma, Myeloid/diagnosis/pathology/*veterinary', 'Species Specificity', 'Survival Analysis']",,2006/12/26 09:00,2007/01/11 09:00,['2006/12/26 09:00'],"['2006/12/26 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/01/11 09:00 [medline]', '2006/12/26 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1892/0891-6640(2006)20[1376:mdiccp]2.0.co;2 [doi]'],ppublish,J Vet Intern Med. 2006 Nov-Dec;20(6):1376-83. doi: 10.1892/0891-6640(2006)20[1376:mdiccp]2.0.co;2.,,,,,PMC7166647,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We observed that murine erythroleukemia (MEL) cells arrested in phase G(1) undergo transcriptional activation of Prn-p gene. Here, we explored the potential role of activation of Prn-p gene and cytosolic accumulation of PrP(C) in growth arrest, differentiation, and apoptotic DNA fragmentation by stably transfecting MEL and N2a cells with Prn-p cDNA. Stably transfected MEL cells (clones # 6, 12, 20, 38, and 42) were assessed for growth and differentiation, while clones N2a13 and N2a8 of N2a cells for growth and apoptosis by flow cytometry using Annexin V and propidium iodide (PI). Our results indicate that (a) Induction of terminal differentiation of stably transfected MEL cells led to growth arrest, activation of Prn-p gene, concomitant expression of transfected Prn-p cDNA, suppression of bax gene, cytosolic accumulation of PrP(C), and DNA fragmentation. The latter was also induced in non-differentiated MEL cells growing under serum-free conditions; (b) similarly, serum deprivation promoted growth arrest, apoptosis/necrosis associated with DNA fragmentation in parental N2a and N2a13 cells that produced relative high level of PrP(C) and not PrP(SC). These data indicate that activation of Prn-p gene and expression of transfected Prn-p cDNA in cells of both hematopoietic and neuronal origin occurred concomitantly, and led to cytosolic accumulation of PrP(C) and DNA damage induced by serum deprivation. PrP(C) production failed to protect DNA fragmentation induced by serum deprivation. The question how does PrP(C) contribute to growth arrest and DNA fragmentation is discussed.","['Gougoumas, Dimitrios D', 'Vizirianakis, Ioannis S', 'Triviai, Ioanna N', 'Tsiftsoglou, Asterios S']","['Gougoumas DD', 'Vizirianakis IS', 'Triviai IN', 'Tsiftsoglou AS']","['Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Laboratory of Pharmacology, Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, Thessaloniki, Greece.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,J Cell Physiol,Journal of cellular physiology,0050222,"['0 (Bax protein, mouse)', '0 (Culture Media, Serum-Free)', '0 (PrPC Proteins)', '0 (Prion Proteins)', '0 (Prions)', '0 (Prnp protein, mouse)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', 'YOW8V9698H (Dimethyl Sulfoxide)']",IM,"['Animals', '*Apoptosis', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Culture Media, Serum-Free/metabolism', 'Cytosol/metabolism', '*DNA Fragmentation', 'Dimethyl Sulfoxide/pharmacology', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/genetics/*metabolism/pathology/physiopathology', 'Mice', 'Neuroblastoma/genetics/*metabolism/pathology/physiopathology', 'PrPC Proteins/*biosynthesis', 'Prion Proteins', 'Prions/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis', 'Time Factors', '*Transcriptional Activation', 'Transfection', 'Up-Regulation', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein/genetics/metabolism']",,2006/12/23 09:00,2007/05/16 09:00,['2006/12/23 09:00'],"['2006/12/23 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/05/16 09:00 [medline]', '2006/12/23 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/jcp.20969 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cell Physiol. 2007 May;211(2):551-9. doi: 10.1002/jcp.20969.,,,,,,"['(c) 2007 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Using the positional candidate approach, we have identified a C-->T substitution in a novel gene, Rd3, that encodes an evolutionarily conserved protein of 195 amino acids. The rd3 mutation results in a predicted stop codon after residue 106. This change is observed in four rd3 lines derived from the original collected mice but not in the nine wild-type mouse strains that were examined. Rd3 is preferentially expressed in the retina and exhibits increasing expression through early postnatal development. In transiently transfected COS-1 cells, the RD3-fusion protein shows subnuclear localization adjacent to promyelocytic leukemia-gene-product bodies. The truncated mutant RD3 protein is detectable in COS-1 cells but appears to get degraded rapidly. To explore potential association of the human RD3 gene at chromosome 1q32 with retinopathies, we performed a mutation screen of 881 probands from North America, India, and Europe. In addition to several alterations of uncertain significance, we identified a homozygous alteration in the invariant G nucleotide of the RD3 exon 2 donor splice site in two siblings with Leber congenital amaurosis. This mutation is predicted to result in premature truncation of the RD3 protein, segregates with the disease, and is not detected in 121 ethnically matched control individuals. We suggest that the retinopathy-associated RD3 protein is part of subnuclear protein complexes involved in diverse processes, such as transcription and splicing.","['Friedman, James S', 'Chang, Bo', 'Kannabiran, Chitra', 'Chakarova, Christina', 'Singh, Hardeep P', 'Jalali, Subhadra', 'Hawes, Norman L', 'Branham, Kari', 'Othman, Mohammad', 'Filippova, Elena', 'Thompson, Debra A', 'Webster, Andrew R', 'Andreasson, Sten', 'Jacobson, Samuel G', 'Bhattacharya, Shomi S', 'Heckenlively, John R', 'Swaroop, Anand']","['Friedman JS', 'Chang B', 'Kannabiran C', 'Chakarova C', 'Singh HP', 'Jalali S', 'Hawes NL', 'Branham K', 'Othman M', 'Filippova E', 'Thompson DA', 'Webster AR', 'Andreasson S', 'Jacobson SG', 'Bhattacharya SS', 'Heckenlively JR', 'Swaroop A']","['Department of Ophthalmology, W.

In solid tumors, the NS is most often due to membranous glomerulonephropathy, whereas in common hematological malignancies, minimal-change disease predominates. Focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) is among the least frequently reported renal lesion associated with malignancy. METHODS: We report a case of the simultaneous diagnoses of FSGS and Hodgkin's lymphoma, and review the literature on various nephrotic glomerulonephropathies associated with common leukemia and lymphoma. RESULTS: Although nephrotic glomerulonephropathies rarely occur in association with acute leukemia, they have often been described in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Membranoproliferative glomerulonephropathy and membranous glomerulonephropathy are the most common lesions observed in CLL. Nephrotic glomerulonephropathies have also been well documented among patients with lymphomas, in particular, Hodgkin's lymphoma. While minimal-change disease is most commonly found in association with Hodgkin's lymphoma, more diverse and complex renal lesions are associated with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. FSGS remains a rare association with hematological malignancies. CONCLUSIONS: Nephrotic glomerulonephropathies are not only linked to solid-organ tumors, but also to hematological malignancies. A thorough evaluation, including a physical examination for lymphadenopathy and organomegaly, as well as a hematological evaluation, must be performed in all patients presenting with nephrotic glomerulonephropathies.","['Mallouk, Abdalla', 'Pham, Phuong-Thu T', 'Pham, Phuong-Chi T']","['Mallouk A', 'Pham PT', 'Pham PC']","['Olive View-UCLA Medical Center, Department of Medicine, Nephrology Division, 14445 Olive View Drive, Sylmar, CA 91342, USA.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",20061220,Japan,Clin Exp Nephrol,Clinical and experimental nephrology,9709923,,IM,"['Adult', 'Glomerulonephritis/etiology', 'Glomerulosclerosis, Focal Segmental/*complications', 'Hodgkin Disease/*complications', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/complications', 'Lymphoma/complications', 'Male', 'Nephrotic Syndrome/etiology']",31,2006/12/23 09:00,2007/01/26 09:00,['2006/12/23 09:00'],"['2006/01/26 00:00 [received]', '2006/08/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2006/12/23 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/01/26 09:00 [medline]', '2006/12/23 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s10157-006-0437-4 [doi]'],ppublish,Clin Exp Nephrol. 2006 Dec;10(4):284-9. doi: 10.1007/s10157-006-0437-4.

SDX-308 and SDX-309 are more potent, structurally related indole-pyran analogues of SDX-101. The current study was performed to investigate and quantify the cytotoxic potentiating effects resulting from a combination of either SDX-101, SDX-308 or SDX-309 with standard cytotoxic agents used in the CLL treatment today. METHODS: The lymphoma cell line U937-gtb was used, together with primary tumour cells isolated from seven CLL patients. Combinations between chlorambucil and each one of the agents etodolac, SDX-101, SDX-308 and SDX-309 were studied. In addition, SDX-309 was combined with fludarabine, doxorubicin or vincristine. Both simultaneous and sequential exposures were explored using the median-effect method. RESULTS: Most combinations were additive, which could be of clinical benefit since SDX-101 has been shown to be well tolerated. At the 70% effect level, synergy was observed between SDX-308 and chlorambucil in U937-gtb cells and in two-third of the CLL samples. Since chlorambucil is the most important drug in CLL therapy today and SDX-308 is presently targeted as the lead clinical candidate, this combination would be interesting for further studies. Vincristine and SDX-309 were synergistic in two-fourth of CLL samples. CONCLUSIONS: To conclude, the non-COX-inhibiting etodolac-derivatives SDX-101, SDX-308 and SDX-309 are potential candidates for combination treatment of CLL. Especially, SDX-308 in combination with chlorambucil warrants further evaluation.","['Lindhagen, Elin', 'Nissle, Sara', 'Leoni, Lorenzo', 'Elliott, Gary', 'Chao, Qi', 'Larsson, Rolf', 'Aleskog, Anna']","['Lindhagen E', 'Nissle S', 'Leoni L', 'Elliott G', 'Chao Q', 'Larsson R', 'Aleskog A']","['Division of Clinical Pharmacology, Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden. elin.lindhagen@medsci.uu.se']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20061222,Germany,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol,Cancer chemotherapy and pharmacology,7806519,"['0 (Heterocyclic Compounds, 3-Ring)', '0 (SDX 308)', '0 (SDX 309)', '18D0SL7309 (Chlorambucil)', '2M36281008 (Etodolac)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Chlorambucil/administration & dosage', 'Doxorubicin/administration & dosage', 'Drug Synergism', 'Etodolac/*pharmacology', 'Female', 'Heterocyclic Compounds, 3-Ring/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy', 'Lymphoma/drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Vincristine/administration & dosage']",,2006/12/23 09:00,2007/09/20 09:00,['2006/12/23 09:00'],"['2006/09/15 00:00 [received]', '2006/11/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2006/12/23 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/09/20 09:00 [medline]', '2006/12/23 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s00280-006-0400-9 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol. 2007 Sep;60(4):545-53. doi: 10.1007/s00280-006-0400-9.

A few authors have reported the extremely rare occurrence of multiple lesions. Triggering or enhancing factors have been occasionally described such as an underlying immunosuppression or associated inflammatory mucous or skin diseases. We report, to the best of our knowledge, the first case report of multiple verruciform xanthomas of the oral mucosa in a patient with graft-versus-host disease with specific oral lesions. CASE REPORT: A 57 year-old man presented with an 8-year history of chronic myeloid leukemia. He was considered in complete remission for leukemia after allogenic bone marrow transplantation. Nevertheless, he was still treated with immunosuppressive drugs for oral and cutaneous lesions of chronic graft-versus-host disease. In this context, the patient presented two symmetric lesions of the gingiva. These lesions had progressed over several months. The clinical presentation was similar, with a yellowish and verrucous aspect and a sessile base. Histologic and immunohistochemical analysis led to the diagnosis of multiple verruciform xanthomas. DISCUSSION: The occurrence of multiple lesions of this rare tumour in our patient was probably not fortuitous. Immunosuppression associated with oral chronic inflammatory lesions are certainly involved in the pathogenesis of these two verruciform xanthomas, for example following degeneration of epithelial cells after local chronic irritation and/or reduction of Langerhans cells.

However, the pattern of NHL heritability remains poorly understood. We conducted a pooled analysis of 10 211 NHL cases and 11 905 controls from the International Lymphoma Epidemiology Consortium (InterLymph) to evaluate NHL risk among those with hematopoietic malignancies in first-degree relatives. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of NHL and its subtypes were estimated from unconditional logistic regression models with adjustment for confounders. NHL risk was elevated for individuals who reported first-degree relatives with NHL (OR = 1.5; 95% CI = 1.2-1.9), Hodgkin lymphoma (OR = 1.6; 95% CI = 1.1-2.3), and leukemia (OR = 1.4; 95% CI = 1.2-2.7). Risk was highest among individuals who reported a brother with NHL (OR = 2.8; 95% CI = 1.6-4.8) and was consistent for all NHL subtypes evaluated. If a first-degree relative had Hodgkin lymphoma, NHL risk was highest if the relative was a parent (OR = 1.7; 95% CI = 1.0-2.9). If a first-degree relative had leukemia, NHL risk was highest among women who reported a sister with leukemia (OR = 3.0; 95% CI = 1.6-5.6). The pattern of NHL heritability appeared to be uniform across NHL subtypes, but risk patterns differed by specific hematopoietic malignancies and the sex of the relative, revealing critical clues to disease etiology.","['Wang, Sophia S', 'Slager, Susan L', 'Brennan, Paul', 'Holly, Elizabeth A', 'De Sanjose, Silvia', 'Bernstein, Leslie', 'Boffetta, Paolo', 'Cerhan, James R', 'Maynadie, Marc', 'Spinelli, John J', 'Chiu, Brian C H', 'Cocco, Pier Luigi', 'Mensah, Fiona', 'Zhang, Yawei', 'Nieters, Alexandra', 'Dal Maso, Luigino', 'Bracci, Paige M', 'Costantini, Adele Seniori', 'Vineis, Paolo', 'Severson, Richard K', 'Roman, Eve', 'Cozen, Wendy', 'Weisenburger, Dennis', 'Davis, Scott', 'Franceschi, Silvia', 'La Vecchia, Carlo', 'Foretova, Lenka', 'Becker, Nikolaus', 'Staines, Anthony', 'Vornanen, Martine', 'Zheng, Tongzhang', 'Hartge, Patricia']","['Wang SS', 'Slager SL', 'Brennan P', 'Holly EA', 'De Sanjose S', 'Bernstein L', 'Boffetta P', 'Cerhan JR', 'Maynadie M', 'Spinelli JJ', 'Chiu BC', 'Cocco PL', 'Mensah F', 'Zhang Y', 'Nieters A', 'Dal Maso L', 'Bracci PM', 'Costantini AS', 'Vineis P', 'Severson RK', 'Roman E', 'Cozen W', 'Weisenburger D', 'Davis S', 'Franceschi S', 'La Vecchia C', 'Foretova L', 'Becker N', 'Staines A', 'Vornanen M', 'Zheng T', 'Hartge P']","['Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, 6120 Executive Boulevard, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA. wangso@mail.nih.gov']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20061221,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,,IM,"['Case-Control Studies', 'Control Groups', 'Family', 'Female', '*Hematologic Neoplasms/epidemiology/etiology/genetics', 'Humans', 'International Cooperation', 'Logistic Models', '*Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/epidemiology/etiology/genetics', 'Male', 'Pedigree', 'Risk Factors', 'Sex Factors']",,2006/12/23 09:00,2007/05/24 09:00,['2006/12/23 09:00'],"['2006/12/23 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/05/24 09:00 [medline]', '2006/12/23 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)41725-2 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2006-06-031948 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2007 Apr 15;109(8):3479-88. doi: 10.1182/blood-2006-06-031948.

Dasatinib is a novel, oral, multitargeted kinase inhibitor of BCR-ABL and SRC family kinases. After promising phase 1 results, we report the results of phase 2 clinical trials of dasatinib in patients with imatinib-resistant or -intolerant blast crisis CML (MBC, n = 74; LBC, n = 42). At the 8-month follow-up, dasatinib induced major hematologic responses (MaHRs) in 34% and 31% of MBC- and LBC-CML patients and major cytogenetic responses (MCyRs) in 31% and 50% of these patients, respectively. Most (86%) of these MCyRs were complete cytogenetic responses (CCyRs). Responses were rapid and durable: 88% and 46%, respectively, of MBC- and LBC-CML patients achieving MaHR had not experienced disease progression at the 8-month follow-up. Response rates were similar in patients with and without BCR-ABL mutations known to confer resistance to imatinib. Dasatinib was well tolerated. Nonhematologic adverse events were mild to moderate. Cytopenias were common and could be managed by dose modification. Dasatinib is highly active and produces hematologic and cytogenetic responses in a significant number of patients with imatinib-resistant or -intolerant MBC- and LBC-CML.

If this is the case, it is of interest to know the effects of the resulting fusion gene, CBFB-MYH11, on other lineages. Here we studied T-cell development in mice expressing Cbfb-MYH11 and compared them with mice compound-heterozygous for a Cbfb null and a hypomorphic GFP knock-in allele (Cbfb(-/GFP)), which had severe Cbfb deficiency. We found a differentiation block at the DN1 stage of thymocyte development in Cbfb-MYH11 knock-in chimeras. In a conditional knock-in model in which Cbfb-MYH11 expression was activated by Lck-Cre, there was a 10-fold reduction in thymocyte numbers in adult thymus, resulting mainly from impaired survival of CD4+CD8+ thymocytes. Although Cbfb-MYH11 derepressed CD4 expression efficiently in reporter assays, such derepression was less pronounced in vivo. On the other hand, CD4 expression was derepressed and thymocyte development was blocked at DN1 and DN2 stages in E17.5 Cbfb(-/GFP) thymus, with a 20-fold reduction of total thymocyte numbers. Our data suggest that Cbfb-MYH11 suppressed Cbfb in several stages of T-cell development and provide a mechanism for CBFB-MYH11 association with myeloid but not lymphoid leukemia.","['Zhao, Ling', 'Cannons, Jennifer L', 'Anderson, Stacie', 'Kirby, Martha', 'Xu, Liping', 'Castilla, Lucio H', 'Schwartzberg, Pamela L', 'Bosselut, Remy', 'Liu, P Paul']","['Zhao L', 'Cannons JL', 'Anderson S', 'Kirby M', 'Xu L', 'Castilla LH', 'Schwartzberg PL', 'Bosselut R', 'Liu PP']","['Genetics and Molecular Biology Branch, National Human Genome Research Institute, National Institutes of Health, 49 Convent Drive, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural']",20061221,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (CD4 Antigens)', '0 (CD8 Antigens)', '0 (Cbfb protein, mouse)', '0 (Core Binding Factor beta Subunit)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', 'EC 3.6.4.1 (Myosin Heavy Chains)']",IM,"['Animals', 'CD4 Antigens/biosynthesis', 'CD8 Antigens/immunology', 'Cell Death/genetics', 'Cell Survival/genetics', '*Chromosome Inversion', 'Core Binding Factor beta Subunit/*biosynthesis/deficiency', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Myosin Heavy Chains/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'T-Lymphocytes/*metabolism/pathology', 'Thymus Gland/*metabolism/pathology']",,2006/12/23 09:00,2007/05/24 09:00,['2006/12/23 09:00'],"['2006/12/23 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/05/24 09:00 [medline]', '2006/12/23 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)41720-3 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2006-10-051508 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2007 Apr 15;109(8):3432-40. doi: 10.1182/blood-2006-10-051508.

In this article, we provide evidence indicating that ZAP recruits the RNA processing exosome to degrade the target RNA. ZAP comigrated with the exosome in sucrose or glycerol velocity gradient centrifugation. Immunoprecipitation of ZAP coprecipitated the exosome components. In vitro pull-down assays indicated that ZAP directly interacted with the exosome component hRrp46p and that the binding region of ZAP was mapped to amino acids 224-254. Depletion of the exosome component hRrp41p or hRrp46p with small interfering RNA significantly reduced ZAP's destabilizing activity.

METHODS: We developed an optimized procedure for gene expression analysis based on a microarray containing 538 oligonucleotides and used this procedure to analyze neoplastic cell lines and whole-blood samples from healthy individuals and patients with different hematologic neoplasias. Hierarchical clustering and the Welch t-test with adjusted P values were used for data analysis. RESULTS: This procedure detects 0.2 fmol of mRNA and generates a linear response of 2 orders of magnitude, with CV values of <20% for hybridization and label replicates. We found statistically significant differences between Jurkat and U937 cell lines, between blood samples from 15 healthy donors and 59 chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) samples, and between 6 acute myeloid leukemia patients and 4 myelodysplastic syndrome patients. A classification system constructed from the expression data predicted healthy or CLL status from a whole-blood sample with a 97% success rate. CONCLUSION: Transcriptional profiling of whole-blood samples was carried out without any cellular or sample manipulation before RNA extraction.

A previous investigation in this cohort linked exposure to the organophosphate fonofos with incident prostate cancer in subjects with family history of prostate cancer. OBJECTIVES: This finding along with findings of associations between organophosphate pesticides and cancer more broadly led to this study of fonofos and risk of any cancers among 45,372 pesticide applicators enrolled in the AHS. METHODS: Pesticide exposure and other data were collected using self-administered questionnaires. Poisson regression was used to calculate rate ratios (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) while controlling for potential confounders. RESULTS: Relative to the unexposed, leukemia risk was elevated in the highest category of lifetime (RR = 2.24; 95% CI, 0.94-5.34, Ptrend = 0.07) and intensity-weighted exposure-days (RR = 2.67; 95% CI, 1.06-6.70, Ptrend = 0.04), a measure that takes into account factors that modify pesticide exposure. Although prostate cancer risk was unrelated to fonofos use overall, among applicators with a family history of prostate cancer, we observed a significant dose-response trend for lifetime exposure-days (Ptrend = 0.02, RR highest tertile vs. unexposed = 1.77, 95% CI, 1.03-3.05; RRinteraction = 1.28, 95% CI, 1.07-1.54).

This study analyzed the types of cancer, timing of collection, sperm quality, and utilization for reproductive services by patients during a 10-year period at a medical center in Taiwan. A total of 75 oncology patients elected to freeze sperm for fertility preservation at our medical center during the initial 10 years of the availability of this service. The mean age of the patients was 25.7 years. Storage was discontinued in 13 (17%) patients and their survival duration was 13.1 +/- 11.1 months. The utilization rate of sperm cryopreservation was 2.8% (75/2642). The types of cancer varied, with leukemia (35%), lymphoma (25%), and testicular cancer (13%) comprising the largest groups. A significantly lower sperm count was found in patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia, suggesting the need for earlier sperm collection after initiation of cancer treatment. Only three (4%) patients utilized their specimens for reproductive purposes. There was no clinical pregnancy during the study period, although one biochemical pregnancy was achieved. The low rates of sperm cryostorage for fertility preservation in cancer patients in this study suggest that there is a need for greater emphasis of this option for male oncology patients whose fertility is likely to be affected by chemotherapeutic treatment.","['Chang, Hong-Chiang', 'Chen, Shyh-Chyan', 'Chen, Jun', 'Hsieh, Ju-Ton']","['Chang HC', 'Chen SC', 'Chen J', 'Hsieh JT']","['Department of Urology, College of Medicine, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Singapore,J Formos Med Assoc,Journal of the Formosan Medical Association = Taiwan yi zhi,9214933,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', '*Cryopreservation', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms/*complications', '*Semen Preservation', 'Taiwan']",,2006/12/23 09:00,2007/02/09 09:00,['2006/12/23 09:00'],"['2006/12/23 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/02/09 09:00 [medline]', '2006/12/23 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0929-6646(09)60288-6 [pii]', '10.1016/S0929-6646(09)60288-6 [doi]']",ppublish,J Formos Med Assoc. 2006 Dec;105(12):1022-6. doi: 10.1016/S0929-6646(09)60288-6.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In vitro experiments show an adenylated sulfoximine to be a slow-onset, tight-binding inhibitor of hASNS with nanomolar affinity. This binding affinity represents a 10-fold improvement over that reported for the only other well-characterized hASNS inhibitor. The adenylated sulfoximine has a cytostatic effect on L-asparaginase-resistant MOLT-4 cells cultured in the presence of L-asparaginase, an enzyme that depletes L-asparagine in the growth medium.

METHODS: The K562 cell line was used as a P210( bcr/abl )-positive cell model in vitro and was exposed to different concentrations of PS-ASODN (0-20 micromol/L), cur (0-20 micromol/L), or a combination of both. Growth inhibition and apoptosis of K562 cells were assessed by MTT assay and AO/EB fluorescent staining, respectively. The expression levels of P210( bcr/abl ), NF-kappaB and heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) were assessed by Western blot. RESULTS: Exposure to cur (5-20 micromol/L) and PSASODN (5-20 micromol/L) resulted in a synergistic inhibitory effect on cell growth. Growth inhibition was associated with the inhibition of the proliferation and induction of apoptosis. Western blot analysis showed that the drugs synergistically downregulated the level of P210( bcr/abl ) and NF-kappaB. Cur downregulated Hsp90, whereas no synergism was observed when cur was combined with PS-ASODN. CONCLUSION: PS-ASODN and cur exhibited a synergistic inhibitory effect on the cell growth of K562.

WHO classification of leukemias was formulated in 1997 with a purpose of further enhancing the objectivity. However, the requirement of cytogenetics and immunophenotyping makes it difficult for many countries like India to put WHO classification in routine use. This study was carried to know the effectiveness of FAB classification in an era of technical advancement. A retrospective analysis of all acute leukemias over a period of 2 years was done. Out of total of 469 cases of acute leukemias, 193 were diagnosed as Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL), 200 as Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML), and 76 cases diagnosed as Acute Leukemia, cytochemically undifferentiated. Hence, only 16% of all leukemias remained unclassifiable. Subclassification of AML cases revealed a much higher percentage of AML-M3, as compared to western literature.

However, the precise mechanism underlying Hoxa9 regulation is not clear. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Here, we show that the expression level of Hoxa9 is correlated with the location of increased trimethylated histone 3 lysine 4 (H3K4M3). The active and repressive histone modifications co-exist along the Hoxa9 regulatory region. We further demonstrate that both Cdx4 and menin bind to the same regulatory region at the Hoxa9 locus in vivo, and co-activate the reporter gene driven by the Hoxa9 cis-elements that contain Cdx4 binding sites. Ablation of menin abrogates Cdx4 access to the chromatin target and significantly reduces both active and repressive histone H3 modifications in the Hoxa9 locus. CONCLUSION: These results suggest a functional link among Cdx4, menin and histone modifications in Hoxa9 regulation in hematopoietic cells.","['Yan, Jizhou', 'Chen, Ya-Xiong', 'Desmond, Angela', 'Silva, Albert', 'Yang, Yuqing', 'Wang, Haoren', 'Hua, Xianxin']","['Yan J', 'Chen YX', 'Desmond A', 'Silva A', 'Yang Y', 'Wang H', 'Hua X']","['Abramson Family Cancer Research Institute, Department of Cancer Biology, Abramson Cancer Center, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States of America.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20061220,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (Cdx4 protein, mouse)', '0 (Chromatin)', '0 (Histones)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (Men1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (homeobox protein HOXA9)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Kmt2a protein, mouse)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Binding Sites/genetics', 'Cell Line, Transformed', 'Chromatin/genetics/metabolism', 'DNA/genetics/metabolism', 'Genes, Reporter', 'Hematopoiesis/*genetics/physiology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*metabolism', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase', 'Histones/chemistry/metabolism', 'Homeodomain Proteins/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Experimental/genetics', 'Mice', 'Multigene Family', 'Mutagenesis, Site-Directed', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*metabolism', 'Regulatory Sequences, Nucleic Acid', 'Transcriptional Activation']",,2006/12/22 09:00,2006/12/22 09:01,['2006/12/22 09:00'],"['2006/09/26 00:00 [received]', '2006/10/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2006/12/22 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/12/22 09:01 [medline]', '2006/12/22 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1371/journal.pone.0000047 [doi]'],epublish,PLoS One. 2006 Dec 20;1:e47. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0000047.,,,,,PMC1762371,,"['R01 CA100912/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA100912/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,['NLM: Original DateCompleted: 20070801'],,,,,,,,,

However, their use is limited by cardiomyopathy, which occurs in children already at cumulative doses of 300 mg/m(2) (given as daunorubicin equivalent). PROCEDURE: To evaluate anthracycline-associated cardiomyopathy in pediatric AML-patients, the incidence of early and late (>1 year after intensive AML chemotherapy) clinical and subclinical cardiotoxicity was analyzed out of a total of 1,207 patients <18 years treated between 1993 and 2003 in trials AML-BFM93/98: 1,010 protocol patients with de novo AML, 121 with Down syndrome (DS)-AML, and 76 with secondary AML. The cumulative dose of anthracyclines was generally risk-adapted: 300-450 mg/m(2) using 1-4-hr infusions of anthracyclines with the assumed lowest cardiotoxic potential. Eight hundred eighty-five patients (73%) were eligible for the analysis of early and 547 (45%) of late cardiotoxicity (1,399 follow-up data). RESULTS: Thirty-eight patients (4.3%), including 3 DS-AML and 1 secondary AML, suffered from early cardiomyopathy. After 5 years, four patients showed temporarily or persistently a reduced shortening fraction, which led to death in one DS-AML patient. Including these 4 patients, late cardiomyopathy was seen in 16 patients (cumulative incidence after 11 years: 5% +/- 1%). Nine patients (2.5 +/- 1%) showed clinical symptoms, five of them had persistent abnormal shortening fraction. Late subclinical cardiomyopathy occurred temporarily in seven patients. Late clinical cardiomyopathy mainly affected patients with a second anthracycline therapy (secondary malignancy) and those with early cardiotoxicity. CONCLUSION: In spite of a highly intensive and effective treatment, the frequency of anthracycline-associated cardiomyopathy was low in the AML-BFM studies.","['Creutzig, Ursula', 'Diekamp, Sylke', 'Zimmermann, Martin', 'Reinhardt, Dirk']","['Creutzig U', 'Diekamp S', 'Zimmermann M', 'Reinhardt D']","[""Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, University Children's Hospital, Muenster, Germany. ursula@creutzig.de""]",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,['0 (Anthracyclines)'],IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Anthracyclines/administration & dosage/*adverse effects', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug-Related Side Effects and Adverse Reactions', 'Echocardiography/methods', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Heart/*drug effects', 'Heart Diseases/*chemically induced/diagnostic imaging', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/diagnosis/*drug therapy', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Male', 'Pilot Projects', 'Risk Factors', 'Survivors', 'Time', 'Treatment Outcome']",,2006/12/22 09:00,2007/10/11 09:00,['2006/12/22 09:00'],"['2006/12/22 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/10/11 09:00 [medline]', '2006/12/22 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/pbc.21105 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2007 Jun 15;48(7):651-62. doi: 10.1002/pbc.21105.,,['Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2007 Jun 15;48(7):649-50.

To clarify the clinical characteristics, mechanisms of hypercalcemia, response to management for hypercalcemia, incidence of t(17;19) and final outcome of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) accompanied by hypercalcemia, clinical data of 22 cases of childhood ALL accompanied by hypercalcemia (>12 mg/dl) reported in Japan from 1990 to 2005 were retrospectively analyzed. Eleven patients were 10 years and older. Twenty patients had low white blood cell count (<20 x 10(9)/l), 15 showed hemoglobin> or =8 g/dl and 14 showed platelet count > or =100 x 10(9)/l. Parathyroid hormone-related peptide (PTHrP)-mediated hypercalcemia was confirmed in 11 of the 16 patients in whom elevated-serum level or positive immunohistochemistry of PTHrP was observed. Hypercalcemia and accompanying renal insufficiency resolved quickly, particularly in patients treated with bisphosphonate. t(17;19) or add(19)(p13) was detected in five patients among 17 patients in whom karyotypic data were available, and the presence of E2A-HLF was confirmed in these five patients. All five patients with t(17;19)-ALL relapsed very early. Excluding the t(17;19)-ALL patients, the final outcome of ALL accompanied by hypercalcemia was similar to that of all childhood ALL patients, indicating that the development of hypercalcemia itself is not a poor prognostic factor.","['Inukai, T', 'Hirose, K', 'Inaba, T', 'Kurosawa, H', 'Hama, A', 'Inada, H', 'Chin, M', 'Nagatoshi, Y', 'Ohtsuka, Y', 'Oda, M', 'Goto, H', 'Endo, M', 'Morimoto, A', 'Imaizumi, M', 'Kawamura, N', 'Miyajima, Y', 'Ohtake, M', 'Miyaji, R', 'Saito, M', 'Tawa, A', 'Yanai, F', 'Goi, K', 'Nakazawa, S', 'Sugita, K']","['Inukai T', 'Hirose K', 'Inaba T', 'Kurosawa H', 'Hama A', 'Inada H', 'Chin M', 'Nagatoshi Y', 'Ohtsuka Y', 'Oda M', 'Goto H', 'Endo M', 'Morimoto A', 'Imaizumi M', 'Kawamura N', 'Miyajima Y', 'Ohtake M', 'Miyaji R', 'Saito M', 'Tawa A', 'Yanai F', 'Goi K', 'Nakazawa S', 'Sugita K']","['Department of Pediatrics, University of Yamanashi, School of Medicine, Yamanashi, Japan. tinukai@yamanashi.ac.jp']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",20061221,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (E2a-Hlf fusion protein, human)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Parathyroid Hormone-Related Protein)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Calcium/blood', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 17', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 19', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Hypercalcemia/*complications/*genetics', 'Male', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*genetics', 'Parathyroid Hormone-Related Protein/*genetics', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/blood/complications/*genetics', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics', '*Translocation, Genetic']",,2006/12/22 09:00,2007/09/26 09:00,['2006/12/22 09:00'],"['2006/12/22 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/09/26 09:00 [medline]', '2006/12/22 09:00 [entrez]']","['2404496 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.leu.2404496 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2007 Feb;21(2):288-96. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2404496.

The authors analyzed the relation between diagnosis (1991-1996) of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) at ages 2-5 years and clinically diagnosed infections in infancy. Almost all study children (96% of both cases and controls) were taken to a general practitioner for a non-immunization-associated visit at least once before their first birthday. Children diagnosed with ALL had significantly more clinically diagnosed infectious episodes in infancy than did controls; the average number of episodes was 3.6 (95% confidence interval (CI): 3.3, 3.9) versus 3.1 (95% CI: 2.9, 3.2). This case-control difference was most apparent in the neonatal period (< or =1 month); 18% of controls and 24% of ALL cases were diagnosed with at least one infection (odds ratio = 1.4, 95% CI: 1.1, 1.9; p < 0.05). Cases who had more than one neonatal infectious episode tended to be diagnosed with ALL at a comparatively young age; the mean age at ALL diagnosis was 37.7 months for cases with two or more episodes versus 45.3 months for cases with only one episode or none (p < 0.01). These findings support the hypothesis that a dysregulated immune response to infection in the first few months of life promotes transition to overt ALL later in childhood.","['Roman, E', 'Simpson, J', 'Ansell, P', 'Kinsey, S', 'Mitchell, C D', 'McKinney, P A', 'Birch, J M', 'Greaves, M', 'Eden, T']","['Roman E', 'Simpson J', 'Ansell P', 'Kinsey S', 'Mitchell CD', 'McKinney PA', 'Birch JM', 'Greaves M', 'Eden T']","['Epidemiology and Genetics Unit, Department of Health Sciences, University of York, York, United Kingdom. eve.roman@egu.york.ac.uk']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20061220,United States,Am J Epidemiol,American journal of epidemiology,7910653,,IM,"['Age of Onset', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Child, Preschool', 'Confidence Intervals', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Infections/*epidemiology', 'Male', 'Odds Ratio', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*epidemiology', 'Risk Factors', 'United Kingdom/epidemiology']",,2006/12/22 09:00,2007/04/04 09:00,['2006/12/22 09:00'],"['2006/12/22 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/04/04 09:00 [medline]', '2006/12/22 09:00 [entrez]']","['kwk039 [pii]', '10.1093/aje/kwk039 [doi]']",ppublish,Am J Epidemiol. 2007 Mar 1;165(5):496-504. doi: 10.1093/aje/kwk039.

We tested whether ZAP also acts against Ebola virus (EBOV) and Marburg virus (MARV). Antiviral effects were observed after infection of cells expressing the N-terminal part of ZAP fused to the product of the zeocin resistance gene (NZAP-Zeo) as well as after infection of cells inducibly expressing full-length ZAP. EBOV was inhibited by up to 4 log units, whereas MARV was inhibited between 1 to 2 log units. The activity of ZAP was dependent on the integrity of the second and fourth zinc finger motif, as tested with cell lines expressing NZAP-Zeo mutants. Heterologous expression of EBOV- and MARV-specific sequences fused to a reporter gene suggest that ZAP specifically targets L gene sequences. The activity of NZAP-Zeo in this assay was also dependent on the integrity of the second and fourth zinc finger motif. Time-course experiments with infectious EBOV showed that ZAP reduces the level of L mRNA before the level of genomic or antigenomic RNA is affected. Transient expression of ZAP decreased the activity of an EBOV replicon system by up to 95%. This inhibitory effect could be partially compensated for by overexpression of L protein. In conclusion, the data demonstrate that ZAP exhibits antiviral activity against filoviruses, presumably by decreasing the level of viral mRNA.","['Muller, Stefanie', 'Moller, Peggy', 'Bick, Matthew J', 'Wurr, Stephanie', 'Becker, Stephan', 'Gunther, Stephan', 'Kummerer, Beate M']","['Muller S', 'Moller P', 'Bick MJ', 'Wurr S', 'Becker S', 'Gunther S', 'Kummerer BM']","['Department of Virology, Bernhard-Nocht-Strasse 74, Bernhard-Nocht-Institute for Tropical Medicine, 20359 Hamburg, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20061220,United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Viral)', '0 (RNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Viral Proteins)', '0 (Zc3hav1 protein, rat)', '11056-06-7 (Bleomycin)', '181494-14-4 (Zeocin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Bleomycin/pharmacology', 'Carrier Proteins/genetics/*physiology', 'Cell Line', 'Chlorocebus aethiops', 'DNA, Viral/genetics', 'Drug Resistance, Viral/genetics', 'Ebolavirus/drug effects/genetics/pathogenicity/physiology', 'Filoviridae/drug effects/genetics/pathogenicity/*physiology', 'Genes, Viral', 'Marburgvirus/drug effects/genetics/pathogenicity/physiology', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'RNA, Viral/genetics/metabolism', 'RNA-Binding Proteins', 'Rats', 'Replicon', 'Vero Cells', 'Viral Proteins/genetics', 'Virus Replication/drug effects/genetics/physiology', 'Zinc Fingers/genetics/physiology']",,2006/12/22 09:00,2007/03/28 09:00,['2006/12/22 09:00'],"['2006/12/22 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/03/28 09:00 [medline]', '2006/12/22 09:00 [entrez]']","['JVI.01601-06 [pii]', '10.1128/JVI.01601-06 [doi]']",ppublish,J Virol. 2007 Mar;81(5):2391-400. doi: 10.1128/JVI.01601-06.

In uninfected cells, the Hrs protein recruits the ESCRT-I complex to the endosome, also through an interaction with Tsg101, to promote the sorting of host proteins into endosomal vesicles and multivesicular bodies.

Expression of the dFYVE or ASAA mutants of Hrs had no effect on the release of Moloney murine leukemia virus. Coimmunoprecipitation analysis showed that the expression of Hrs mutant dFYVE or ASAA significantly reduced or abolished the HIV-1 Gag-Tsg101 interaction. Yeast-two hybrid assays were used to identify two new and independent Tsg101 binding sites, one in the Hrs coiled-coil domain and one in the proline/glutamic acid-rich domain. Scanning electron microscopy of HeLa cells expressing HIV-1 Gag and the Hrs ASAA mutant showed viral particles arrested in ""lump-like"" structures that remained attached to the cell surface.

Considering the critical role of BORIS in cancerogenesis and the fact that its expression pattern may preclude thymic tolerance, we generated DNA- and protein-based mouse BORIS antitumor vaccines using a non-DNA-binding version of the BORIS molecule. Clinical use of BORIS as a vaccine Ag would require that certain safety concerns be met. Specifically, administration of the functional BORIS protein would hypothetically pose a risk of BORIS accelerating the progression of cancer. To alleviate such safety concerns, we have developed vaccines based on the BORIS molecule lacking the DNA-binding zinc fingers domain. To enhance anti-BORIS cellular immune responses, we used a standard molecular adjuvant approach. It consisted of plasmids encoding murine IL-12 and IL-18 for a DNA-based vaccine and conventional Th1 type adjuvant, Quil A, for a protein-based vaccine. Both DNA- and protein-based vaccines induced Ag-specific CD4(+) T cell proliferation with Th1 and Th2 cytokine profiles, respectively.

In rat basophilic leukemia-2H3 cells expressing formyl peptide receptor, the PKG inhibitors KT5823 and Rp-8-Br-PET-cGMP, as well as the PI3K inhibitor LY294002, reduced agonist-stimulated beta-hexosaminidase release in a dose-dependent manner. These inhibitors also abolished vesicular fusion with the plasma membrane, as evidenced by diminished annexin V staining. Agonist-induced degranulation was completely blocked when LY294002 was applied together with one of the PKG inhibitors, suggesting an additive and possibly synergistic effect. In contrast, the PKG inhibitors did not affect fMLF-induced intracellular calcium mobilization and Akt phosphorylation. Likewise, LY294002 did not alter fMLF-induced elevation of intracellular cGMP concentration, and the inhibitory effect of LY294002 was not reversed by a cell-permeable analog of cGMP. Treatment with fMLF induced phosphorylation of soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor-attachment protein (SNAP)-23, syntaxins 2, 4, and 6, and Monc18-3. The induced phosphorylation of SNAP-23 and syntaxins 2 and 4 was blocked by Rp-8-Br-PET-cGMP and LY294002. However, LY294002 was less effective in inhibiting Munc18-3 phosphorylation. The induced phosphorylation of syntaxin 6 was not effectively blocked by either Rp-8-Br-PET-cGMP or LY294002. Treatment of human neutrophils with the PKG inhibitors and LY294002 reduced enzyme release from primary, secondary, and tertiary granules. These results suggest that PKG and PI3K are involved in degranulation, possibly through phosphorylation of target membrane SNAP receptor proteins and their binding proteins.","['Nanamori, Masakatsu', 'Chen, Jia', 'Du, Xiaoping', 'Ye, Richard D']","['Nanamori M', 'Chen J', 'Du X', 'Ye RD']","['Department of Pharmacology, College of Medicine, University of Illinois, Chicago, IL 60612, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Carbazoles)', '0 (Chromones)', '0 (Indoles)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Morpholines)', '0 (Phosphoinositide-3 Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Receptors, IgE)', '0 (SNARE Proteins)', '0 (Thionucleotides)', '126643-37-6 (KT 5823)', ""172806-21-2 (8-bromo-beta-phenyl-1,N(2)-ethenoguanosine 3',5'-cyclic"", 'monophosphorothioate)', '31M2U1DVID (2-(4-morpholinyl)-8-phenyl-4H-1-benzopyran-4-one)', '59880-97-6 (N-Formylmethionine Leucyl-Phenylalanine)', 'EC 2.7.11.12 (Cyclic GMP-Dependent Protein Kinases)', 'H2D2X058MU (Cyclic GMP)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Carbazoles/pharmacology', '*Cell Degranulation', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Membrane/metabolism', 'Chromones/pharmacology', 'Cyclic GMP/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Cyclic GMP-Dependent Protein Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Indoles/pharmacology', 'Leukocytes/drug effects/enzymology/immunology', 'Mast Cells/metabolism', 'Membrane Proteins/metabolism', 'Morpholines/pharmacology', 'N-Formylmethionine Leucyl-Phenylalanine/pharmacology', 'Neutrophils/drug effects/enzymology/*immunology', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/*metabolism', 'Phosphoinositide-3 Kinase Inhibitors', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Rats', 'Receptors, IgE/antagonists & inhibitors', 'SNARE Proteins/*metabolism', 'Thionucleotides/pharmacology']",,2006/12/22 09:00,2007/03/07 09:00,['2006/12/22 09:00'],"['2006/12/22 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/03/07 09:00 [medline]', '2006/12/22 09:00 [entrez]']","['178/1/416 [pii]', '10.4049/jimmunol.178.1.416 [doi]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 2007 Jan 1;178(1):416-27. doi: 10.4049/jimmunol.178.1.416.,,,,,,,"['AI033503/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'HL068819/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 DK07739/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, we show that the preincubation of resting human NK cells with the leukemia cell CTV-1 primes NK cells to lyse NK-resistant cell lines, primary leukemias, and solid tumors even when HLA-matched, allogeneic or autologous. The primed NK cells remained nonresponsive to HLA-C matched and mismatched normal mononuclear cells from multiple donors. CD69, a known NK trigger receptor, was shown to be the predominant trigger on the tumor-primed NK cells because lysis was blocked with the rCD69 protein. The lack of lytic activity against normal hemopoietic cells implied that the ligand for CD69 is tumor restricted, and this was confirmed by experiments using fluorochrome labeled rCD69. It has been recently shown that resting NK cells require prior stimulation with IL-2 before triggering by all known NK-triggering ligands. In this study, we show that a tumor cell can provide the NK priming signal independently of IL-2. These data provide evidence for two NK evasion strategies for tumor cells, namely the prevention of priming (type1 evasion) and failure to trigger (type 2 evasion). Most NK-resistant cell lines are type 1 and fail to prime resting NK cells but are lysed by IL-2-primed NK cells. In contrast, CTV-1 cells prime resting NK cells but fail to trigger (type 2), and coincubation with CTV-1 primes for triggering by type 1 NK-resistant tumor cells. These tumor-activated NK cells lyse a broad spectrum of tumor cells with a degree of specificity never previously reported.","['North, Janet', 'Bakhsh, Ismail', 'Marden, Chloe', 'Pittman, Hanna', 'Addison, Elena', 'Navarrete, Cristina', 'Anderson, Robert', 'Lowdell, Mark W']","['North J', 'Bakhsh I', 'Marden C', 'Pittman H', 'Addison E', 'Navarrete C', 'Anderson R', 'Lowdell MW']","['Department of Haematology, Royal Free and University College Medical School, London, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte)', '0 (CD69 antigen)', '0 (Lectins, C-Type)', '0 (Ligands)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antigens, CD/*metabolism', 'Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte/*metabolism', 'Cell Communication', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Cross-Priming', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Killer Cells, Natural/drug effects/*immunology', 'Lectins, C-Type', 'Leukemia/*immunology', 'Ligands', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms/*immunology', 'Recombinant Proteins/pharmacology', 'T-Lymphocyte Subsets/drug effects/*immunology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Up-Regulation']",,2006/12/22 09:00,2007/03/07 09:00,['2006/12/22 09:00'],"['2006/12/22 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/03/07 09:00 [medline]', '2006/12/22 09:00 [entrez]']","['178/1/85 [pii]', '10.4049/jimmunol.178.1.85 [doi]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 2007 Jan 1;178(1):85-94. doi: 10.4049/jimmunol.178.1.85.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The bond is in SU linked to a CXXC motif. This carries a free thiol that upon receptor binding can be activated (ionized) to attack the disulphide and rearrange it into a disulphide isomer within the motif. To find out whether His8 in the conserved SPHQ sequence of Env directs thiol activation, we analyzed its ionization in MLV vectors with wtEnv and Env with His8 deleted or substituted for Tyr or Arg, which partially or completely arrests fusion. The ionization was monitored by following the pH effect on isomerization in vitro by Ca2+ depletion or in vivo by receptor binding. We found that wtEnv isomerized optimally at slightly basic pH whereas the partially active mutant required higher and the inactive mutants still higher pH. This suggests that His8 directs the ionization of the CXXC thiol.","['Li, Kejun', 'Zhang, Shujing', 'Kronqvist, Malin', 'Ekstrom, Maria', 'Wallin, Michael', 'Garoff, Henrik']","['Li K', 'Zhang S', 'Kronqvist M', 'Ekstrom M', 'Wallin M', 'Garoff H']","['Department of Biosciences and Nutrition, Karolinska Institute, S-141 57 HUDDINGE, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20061219,United States,Virology,Virology,0110674,"['0 (Protein Subunits)', '0 (Receptors, Virus)', '0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)', '4QD397987E (Histidine)', 'EC 5.3.4.1 (Protein Disulfide-Isomerases)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Substitution', 'Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Membrane/metabolism', 'Histidine/*physiology', 'Hydrogen-Ion Concentration', 'Membrane Fusion', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/*physiology', 'Protein Disulfide-Isomerases/*metabolism', 'Protein Subunits/metabolism', 'Receptors, Virus/metabolism', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Viral Envelope Proteins/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Virus Replication']",,2006/12/22 09:00,2007/06/23 09:00,['2006/12/22 09:00'],"['2006/09/07 00:00 [received]', '2006/10/31 00:00 [revised]', '2006/11/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2006/12/22 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/06/23 09:00 [medline]', '2006/12/22 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0042-6822(06)00849-X [pii]', '10.1016/j.virol.2006.11.013 [doi]']",ppublish,Virology. 2007 Apr 25;361(1):149-60. doi: 10.1016/j.virol.2006.11.013.

In normal myelopoiesis, expression of CD33 is restricted to advanced stages of differentiation, whereas primitive stem cells do not express CD33. In the present study, we asked whether leukaemic stem cells in patients with AML express CD33. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A multicolour-staining technique was applied in 11 patients with AML, and leukaemic progenitors defined as CD34(+)/CD38(-)/CD123(+) cells. AML stem cells were purified by cell sorting and were examined for expression of CD33 mRNA by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). RESULTS: In all patients in whom the majority of myeloblasts expressed CD33 (n = 8), AML progenitors reacted with the CD33 antibody P67.6. Repopulation experiments utilizing irradiated NOD/SCID mice confirmed that AML stem cells in these patients reside within the CD33(+) subpopulation of the leukaemic clone. Moreover, highly purified AML stem cells (> 98% purity) from patients with CD33(+) AML were found to express CD33 mRNA in RT-PCR analyses. CD33 was neither detectable on CD34(+)/CD38(-) cells in normal bone marrow nor on leukaemic stem cells in patients with CD33-negative AML. CONCLUSIONS: Leukaemic stem cells in patients with CD33(+) AML express CD33.

Newer treatment regimens incorporating purine nucleoside analogs have increased the rate of successful remission induction in chronic lymphocytic leukemia patients. Moreover, recent combination chemoimmunotherapy regimens have produced more frequent complete molecular remissions, and early evidence seems to suggest that this could result in prolonged duration of responses, although this association remains to be clearly demonstrated. This review will summarize recent advances in the biology and the management of chronic lymphocytic leukemia, including prognostic factors, pointing mainly on combination chemotherapy based on nucleoside analogs and monoclonal antibodies. In our opinion, in the future a significant improvement of clinical benefits in chronic lymphocytic leukemia will be obtained through the administration of cocktails of monoclonal antibodies combined with chemotherapy in different modalities.","['Del Poeta, Giovanni', 'Ilaria Del Principe, Maria', 'Buccisano, Francesco', 'Maurillo, Luca', 'Niscola, Pasquale', 'Venditti, Adriano', 'Amadori, Sergio']","['Del Poeta G', 'Ilaria Del Principe M', 'Buccisano F', 'Maurillo L', 'Niscola P', 'Venditti A', 'Amadori S']","['Cattedra di Ematologia, Universita Tor Vergata, Ospedale S.Eugenio, Via Fiume Giallo, 430 MA, 00144 Roma, Italy. g.delpoeta@tin.it']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",,England,Expert Rev Anticancer Ther,Expert review of anticancer therapy,101123358,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '18D0SL7309 (Chlorambucil)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/*therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis', 'B-Lymphocytes/metabolism/pathology', 'Biomarkers, Tumor', 'Cell Cycle', 'Chemotherapy, Adjuvant', 'Chlorambucil/therapeutic use', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Female', 'Gene Rearrangement, B-Lymphocyte', 'Genes, Immunoglobulin', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', '*Immunotherapy', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/diagnosis/drug therapy/surgery/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Proteins/metabolism', 'Opportunistic Infections/etiology/prevention & control', 'Prognosis', 'Survival Analysis']",86,2006/12/22 09:00,2007/03/09 09:00,['2006/12/22 09:00'],"['2006/12/22 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/03/09 09:00 [medline]', '2006/12/22 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1586/14737140.6.12.1787 [doi]'],ppublish,Expert Rev Anticancer Ther. 2006 Dec;6(12):1787-800. doi: 10.1586/14737140.6.12.1787.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Surprisingly, HIF-1alpha+/- fracture calluses are larger, stronger, and stiffer than HIF-1alpha+/+ calluses because of decreased apoptosis. These data identify apoptosis inhibition as a means to enhance bone regeneration. INTRODUCTION: Bone regeneration subsequent to fracture involves the synergistic activation of multiple signaling pathways. Localized hypoxia after fracture activates hypoxia-inducible factor 1alpha (HIF-1alpha), leading to increased expression of HIF-1 target genes. We therefore hypothesized that HIF-1alpha is a key regulator of bone regeneration. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fixed femoral fractures were generated in mice with partial HIF-1alpha deficiency (HIF-1alpha+/-) and wildtype littermates (HIF-1alpha+/+). Fracture calluses and intact contralateral femurs from postfracture days (PFDs) 21 and 28 (N=5-10) were subjected to microCT evaluation and four-point bending to assess morphometric and mechanical properties. Molecular analyses were carried out on PFD 7, 10, and 14 samples (N=3) to determine differential gene expression at both mRNA and protein levels. Finally, TUNEL staining was performed on PFD 14 samples (N=2) to elucidate differential apoptosis. RESULTS: Surprisingly, fracture calluses from HIF-1alpha+/- mice exhibited greater mineralization and were larger, stronger, and stiffer. Microarray analyses focused on hypoxia-induced genes revealed differential expression (between genotypes) of several genes associated with the apoptotic pathway. Real-time PCR confirmed these results, showing higher expression of proapoptotic protein phosphatase 2a (PP2A) and lower expression of anti-apoptotic B-cell leukemia/lymphoma 2 (BCL2) in HIF-1alpha+/+ calluses. Subsequent TUNEL staining showed that HIF-1alpha+/+ calluses contained larger numbers of TUNEL+ chondrocytes and osteoblasts than HIF-1alpha+/- calluses. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that partial HIF-1alpha deficiency results in decreased chondrocytic and osteoblastic apoptosis, thereby allowing the development of larger, stiffer calluses and enhancing bone regeneration. Furthermore, apoptosis inhibition may be a promising target for developing new treatments to accelerate bone regeneration.","['Komatsu, David E', 'Bosch-Marce, Marta', 'Semenza, Gregg L', 'Hadjiargyrou, Michael']","['Komatsu DE', 'Bosch-Marce M', 'Semenza GL', 'Hadjiargyrou M']","['Department of Biomedical Engineering, Stony Brook University, Stony Brook, NY, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",,United States,J Bone Miner Res,Journal of bone and mineral research : the official journal of the American Society for Bone and Mineral Research,8610640,"['0 (Hif1a protein, mouse)', '0 (Hypoxia-Inducible Factor 1, alpha Subunit)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Animals, Genetically Modified', '*Apoptosis/genetics', '*Bone Regeneration/genetics', 'Bony Callus/metabolism', 'Chondrocytes', 'Female', 'Femoral Fractures/genetics/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Profiling', '*Gene Expression Regulation/genetics', 'Hypoxia/genetics/metabolism', 'Hypoxia-Inducible Factor 1, alpha Subunit/*deficiency/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Osteoblasts/*metabolism']",,2006/12/22 09:00,2007/04/25 09:00,['2006/12/22 09:00'],"['2006/12/22 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/04/25 09:00 [medline]', '2006/12/22 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1359/jbmr.061207 [doi]'],ppublish,J Bone Miner Res. 2007 Mar;22(3):366-74. doi: 10.1359/jbmr.061207.,,,,,PMC2268762,,"['R03 AR047603-01/AR/NIAMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R03 AR047603-02/AR/NIAMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R03 AR047603-03/AR/NIAMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R03AR476032/AR/NIAMS NIH HHS/United States']",['NIHMS41322'],,,,,,,,,,,

Radiation leukemia virus (RadLV)-transformed thymic lymphoma clones expressing various phenotypes reflected this sensitivity, in that a CD4(+)8(+)3(+) clone apoptosed by thymic epithelial cells or TEC. Other, single positive or double negative clones were resistant. Thymocytes from C3H (H-2(k)), C57BL/6 (H-2(b)) and Balb/C (H-2(d)) mice apoptosed equally in response to either C57BL/6 thymic epithelial cells or TEC (H-2(b) x H-2(d)). Likewise, thymocytes from MRLIpr((-/-)) and B6Ipr((-/-)) mice, which do not express CD95 were also apoptosed by TEC.The data suggest that thymic epithelial cells induce MHC non-restricted, Fas-independent apoptosis of immature thymocytes. This response may reflect a mechanism through which thymocytes expressing TcR with no affinity to self MHC/peptide complexes are eliminated.","['Guy, R', 'Gafanovich, I', 'Rosenheimer, N', 'Oron, E', 'Yefenof, E', 'Zilberman, Y']","['Guy R', 'Gafanovich I', 'Rosenheimer N', 'Oron E', 'Yefenof E', 'Zilberman Y']","['The Lautenberg Center for General and Tumor Immunology, The Hebrew University, Hadassah Medical School, Jerusalem, Israel.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,England,Cell Death Differ,Cell death and differentiation,9437445,,,,,1996/10/01 00:00,1996/10/01 00:01,['1996/10/01 00:00'],"['1996/02/13 00:00 [received]', '1996/05/12 00:00 [revised]', '1996/05/16 00:00 [accepted]', '1996/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cell Death Differ. 1996 Oct;3(4):431-8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The nuclear morphology of FDCP-Mix cells was consistent after apoptotic induction by drug or by growth factor withdrawal. Apoptotic nuclear morphology for MOLT-4 and FDCP-Mix showed variations in the distribution, density and texture of the electron dense nuclear marginations. Despite these differences, clustering of nuclear pore complexes (NPCs) after treatment with the topoisomerase II inhibitor etoposide was a common phenomenon for both cell lines. Moreover, pore clustering for FDCP-Mix nuclei occurred independently from the way in which apoptosis was induced, either by growth factor withdrawal or etoposide treatment.

APO-1 expression and the degree of sialylation were determined in additionalT and B cell lines. On the group I Burkitt's lymphoma cell line BL60 transfected with human APO-1 (K50) low sialylated species were detected only on the cell surface, suggesting that sialylation might be functionally important.

Apoptosis was induced by the 2'-deoxyadenosine analogue, 2-chloro-2'-deoxyadenosine (Cl-dA), with the concentration for apoptosis in one-half of the cells at 24 hours (LD(50)) being 10 microM for 697 cells and 120 microM for 697/Bcl 2 cells. There was a strong positive correlation between Cl-dATP levels and apoptotic index (coefficient of determination, r(2)=0.95; P=0.027). When 697 cell and 697/Bcl 2 cell lines were treated with 5 microM Cl-dA, Cl-dATP did not significantly accumulate in the latter. The Cl-dATP/dATP ratio was 0.03 in Cl-dA treated 697/Bcl 2 cells but nearly 6 in treated 697 cells. Bcl 2 overproduction also suppressed the accumulation of dAMP, dADP and dATP in cells exposed to 2'-deoxyadenosine in the presence of pentostatin to abrogate the pronounced inversion of ATP/dATP pools associated with 2'-deoxyadenosine exposure. These results suggest that one consequence of bcl-2 activity is suppression of 2'-deoxyadenosine phosphorylation and elevation in the apoptotic target cells. Relief from deoxyadenylate stress imbalances implies a novel upstream site of bcl-2 activity.","['Gao, X', 'Knudsen, T B', 'Ibrahim, M M', 'Haldar, S']","['Gao X', 'Knudsen TB', 'Ibrahim MM', 'Haldar S']","['Department of Pathology, Anatomy and Cell Biology, Jefferson Medical College, Philadelphia, PA 19107, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,England,Cell Death Differ,Cell death and differentiation,9437445,,,,,1995/01/01 00:00,1995/01/01 00:01,['1995/01/01 00:00'],"['1994/06/20 00:00 [received]', '1994/09/09 00:00 [accepted]', '1995/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cell Death Differ. 1995 Jan;2(1):69-78.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To correlate virus expression and cell cycle progression of recipient cells after acute infection with HTLV-I, K562 multipotent erytholeukemia and Molt-4 T-lymphoma cells were used as recipient cells in a cell-to-cell virus transmission model. Cell cycle progression was studied by flow cytometry during one duplication cycle of recipient cells and transcription of HTLV-I was evaluated during the same time course. The antiproliferative and antiviral effects of recombinant interferons alpha, beta and gamma were also evaluated on cell cycle progression and HTLV-I expression. Transcription of HTLV-I in immortalised virus-donor MT-2 T-cells was found to be related to cell cycle. After coculturing recipient K562 or Molt-4 cells with lethally irradiated, non-dividing virus-donor MT-2 cells, progression into cell cycle of recipient cells was delayed. A pre-G(1) peak, corresponding to 6-11 % apoptotic cells, was identified in cocultured Molt-4/MT-2 cells and not in Molt-4 controls, and was not affected by treatment with IFNs. Notably, no such peak was identified either in control or in cocultured K562 cells. During this time course, transcription of the viral subgenomic mRNA encoding for the env-pX region was prevalently observed. Treatment with IFNalpha and especially with IFNbeta at the onset of the cultures inhibited the growth of both control and virus-exposed recipient cells. IFNgamma was less effective. A clearcut reduction of the percentage of cells entering the S phase was observed only after treatment with IFNbeta. At the same time, in IFNbeta-treated cocultures a marked inhibition of transcription of viral mRNA was observed, suggesting that, during acute infection, treatment with IFNbeta contributes to reduce the infection of recipient cells by down-regulating both the cellular proliferation rate and virus transcription in infected cells.","[""D'Onofrio, C"", 'Puglianiello, A', 'Lanzilli, G', 'Peci, E', 'Starace, G', 'Bonmassar, E']","[""D'Onofrio C"", 'Puglianiello A', 'Lanzilli G', 'Peci E', 'Starace G', 'Bonmassar E']","['Department of Experimental Medicine and Biochemical Sciences, University of Rome Tor Vergata, Rome, Italy.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,England,Cell Death Differ,Cell death and differentiation,9437445,,,,,1995/01/01 00:00,1995/01/01 00:01,['1995/01/01 00:00'],"['1994/07/20 00:00 [received]', '1994/09/28 00:00 [revised]', '1994/10/14 00:00 [accepted]', '1995/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cell Death Differ. 1995 Jan;2(1):57-68.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the role of CSCs in multistage cancer progression, particularly with respect to metastasis, has not been well-defined. Cancer metastasis requires the seeding and successful colonization of specialized CSCs at distant organs. The biology of normal stem cells and CSCs share remarkable similarities and may have important implications when applied to the study of cancer metastasis. Furthermore, overlapping sets of molecules and pathways have recently been identified to regulate both stem cell migration and cancer metastasis. These molecules constitute a complex network of cellular interactions that facilitate both the initiation of the pre-metastasis niche by the primary tumor and the formation of a nurturing organ microenvironment for migrating CSCs. In this review, we surveyed the recent advances in this dynamic field and propose a unified model of cancer progression in which CSCs assume a central role in both tumorigenesis and metastasis. Better understanding of CSCs as a fundamental component of the metastatic cascade will lead to novel therapeutic strategies against metastatic cancer.","['Li, Feng', 'Tiede, Benjamin', 'Massague, Joan', 'Kang, Yibin']","['Li F', 'Tiede B', 'Massague J', 'Kang Y']","['Department of Molecular Biology, Princeton University, Washington Road, Princeton, NJ 08544, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", 'Review']",,England,Cell Res,Cell research,9425763,,IM,"['Animals', '*Cell Communication/physiology', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/*pathology', 'Disease Progression', 'Humans', 'Neoplasm Metastasis/*pathology', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*pathology']",139,2006/12/21 09:00,2007/05/16 09:00,['2006/12/21 09:00'],"['2006/12/21 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/05/16 09:00 [medline]', '2006/12/21 09:00 [entrez]']","['7310118 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.cr.7310118 [doi]']",ppublish,Cell Res. 2007 Jan;17(1):3-14. doi: 10.1038/sj.cr.7310118.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

An earlier biologically based model that was designed to estimate risks of high-dose radiation-induced solid cancers included initiation of stem cells to a premalignant state, inactivation of stem cells at high radiation doses, and proliferation of stem cells during cellular repopulation after inactivation. This earlier model predicted the risks of solid tumors induced by radiation therapy but overestimated the corresponding leukemia risks. METHODS: To extend the model to radiation-induced leukemias, we analyzed--in addition to cellular initiation, inactivation, and proliferation--a repopulation mechanism specific to the hematopoietic system: long-range migration through the blood stream of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) from distant locations. Parameters for the model were derived from HSC biologic data in the literature and from leukemia risks among atomic bomb survivors who were subjected to much lower radiation doses. RESULTS: Proliferating HSCs that migrate from sites distant from the high-dose region include few preleukemic HSCs, thus decreasing the high-dose leukemia risk. The extended model for leukemia provides risk estimates that are consistent with epidemiologic data for leukemia risk associated with radiation therapy over a wide dose range. For example, when applied to an earlier case-control study of 110,000 women undergoing radiotherapy for uterine cancer, the model predicted an excess relative risk (ERR) of 1.9 for leukemia among women who received a large inhomogeneous fractionated external beam dose to the bone marrow (mean = 14.9 Gy), consistent with the measured ERR (2.0, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.2 to 6.4; from 3.6 cases expected and 11 cases observed). As a corresponding example for brachytherapy, the predicted ERR of 0.80 among women who received an inhomogeneous low-dose-rate dose to the bone marrow (mean = 2.5 Gy) was consistent with the measured ERR (0.62, 95% CI = -0.2 to 1.9). CONCLUSIONS: An extended, biologically based model for leukemia that includes HSC initiation, inactivation, proliferation, and, uniquely for leukemia, long-range HSC migration predicts, with reasonable accuracy, risks for radiation-induced leukemia associated with exposure to therapeutic doses of radiation.","['Shuryak, Igor', 'Sachs, Rainer K', 'Hlatky, Lynn', 'Little, Mark P', 'Hahnfeldt, Philip', 'Brenner, David J']","['Shuryak I', 'Sachs RK', 'Hlatky L', 'Little MP', 'Hahnfeldt P', 'Brenner DJ']","['Center for Radiological Research, Columbia University Medical Center, 630 West 168th St., New York, NY 10032, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",,United States,J Natl Cancer Inst,Journal of the National Cancer Institute,7503089,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Bone Marrow/*radiation effects', 'Brachytherapy/adverse effects', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cell Movement/radiation effects', 'Cell Proliferation/radiation effects', 'Confounding Factors, Epidemiologic', 'Dose Fractionation, Radiation', 'Female', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*radiation effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Radiation-Induced/epidemiology/*etiology', 'Mathematical Computing', 'Middle Aged', 'Models, Biological', 'Radiotherapy Dosage', 'Registries', 'Research Design', 'Risk Assessment', 'Uterine Neoplasms/radiotherapy']",,2006/12/21 09:00,2007/01/11 09:00,['2006/12/21 09:00'],"['2006/12/21 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/01/11 09:00 [medline]', '2006/12/21 09:00 [entrez]']","['98/24/1794 [pii]', '10.1093/jnci/djj497 [doi]']",ppublish,J Natl Cancer Inst. 2006 Dec 20;98(24):1794-806. doi: 10.1093/jnci/djj497.,,,,,,,"['P01 CA-49062/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P41 EB-002033/EB/NIBIB NIH HHS/United States', 'U19 AI-67773/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,

By fluorescent in situ hybridization and 3' rapid amplification of cDNA ends, we showed that the paired box domain of PAX5 was fused with the elastin (ELN) gene. After cloning the full-length cDNA of the chimeric gene, confocal microscopy of transfected NIH3T3 cells and Burkitt lymphoma cells (DG75) demonstrated that PAX5-ELN was localized in the nucleus. Chromatin immunoprecipitation clearly indicated that PAX5-ELN retained the capability to bind CD19 and BLK promoter sequences. To analyze the functions of the chimeric protein, HeLa cells were cotransfected with a luc-CD19 construct, pcDNA3-PAX5, and with increasing amounts of pcDNA3-PAX5-ELN. Thus, in vitro, PAX5-ELN was able to block CD19 transcription. Furthermore, real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RQ-PCR) experiments showed that PAX5-ELN was able to affect the transcription of endogenous PAX5 target genes. Since PAX5 is essential for B-cell differentiation, this translocation may account for the blockage of leukemic cells at the pre-B-cell stage. The mechanism involved in this process appears to be, at least in part, through a dominant-negative effect of PAX5-ELN on the wild-type PAX5 in a setting ofPAX5 haploinsufficiency.","['Bousquet, Marina', 'Broccardo, Cyril', 'Quelen, Cathy', 'Meggetto, Fabienne', 'Kuhlein, Emilienne', 'Delsol, Georges', 'Dastugue, Nicole', 'Brousset, Pierre']","['Bousquet M', 'Broccardo C', 'Quelen C', 'Meggetto F', 'Kuhlein E', 'Delsol G', 'Dastugue N', 'Brousset P']","['INSERM U563, Centre de Physiopathologie de Toulouse Purpan, Place Baylac, 31059 Toulouse Cedex, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20061219,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antigens, CD19)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (PAX5 Transcription Factor)', '0 (PAX5 protein, human)', '9007-58-3 (Elastin)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Animals', 'Antigens, CD19/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Cell Differentiation/genetics', 'Cell Nucleus/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 7/*genetics', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 9/*genetics', 'Elastin/biosynthesis/*genetics', '*Genes, Dominant', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Mice', 'NIH 3T3 Cells', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'PAX5 Transcription Factor/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/genetics', 'Transcription, Genetic/genetics', '*Translocation, Genetic']",,2006/12/21 09:00,2007/05/24 09:00,['2006/12/21 09:00'],"['2006/12/21 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/05/24 09:00 [medline]', '2006/12/21 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)41718-5 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2006-05-025221 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2007 Apr 15;109(8):3417-23. doi: 10.1182/blood-2006-05-025221.

We investigated the molecular effects of mTOR inhibition by the rapamycin derivatives (RDs) temsirolimus (CCI-779) and everolimus (RAD001) in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells. Unexpectedly, RDs not only inhibited the mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) containing mTOR and raptor with decreased p70S6K, 4EPB1 phosphorylation, and GLUT1 mRNA, but also blocked AKT activation via inhibition of mTORC2 formation. This resulted in suppression of phosphorylation of the direct AKT substrate FKHR and decreased transcription of D-cyclins in AML cells. Similar observations were made in samples from patients with hematologic malignancies who received RDs in clinical studies. Our study provides the first evidence that rapamycin derivatives inhibit AKT signaling in primary AML cells both in vitro and in vivo, and supports the therapeutic potential of mTOR inhibition strategies in leukemias.","['Zeng, Zhihong', 'Sarbassov, Dos D', 'Samudio, Ismael J', 'Yee, Karen W L', 'Munsell, Mark F', 'Ellen Jackson, C', 'Giles, Francis J', 'Sabatini, David M', 'Andreeff, Michael', 'Konopleva, Marina']","['Zeng Z', 'Sarbassov dos D', 'Samudio IJ', 'Yee KW', 'Munsell MF', 'Ellen Jackson C', 'Giles FJ', 'Sabatini DM', 'Andreeff M', 'Konopleva M']","['Section of Molecular Hematology and Therapy, Department of Stem Cell Transplantation, University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20061219,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Cyclin D)', '0 (Cyclins)', '0 (Glucose Transporter Type 1)', '0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (RICTOR protein, human)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RPTOR protein, human)', '0 (Rapamycin-Insensitive Companion of mTOR Protein)', '0 (Regulatory-Associated Protein of mTOR)', '0 (SLC2A1 protein, human)', '624KN6GM2T (temsirolimus)', '9HW64Q8G6G (Everolimus)', 'EC 2.7.- (Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.1.1 (MTOR protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Ribosomal Protein S6 Kinases, 70-kDa)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'W36ZG6FT64 (Sirolimus)']",IM,"['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing', 'Carrier Proteins/*metabolism', 'Cyclin D', 'Cyclins/metabolism', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Everolimus', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/drug effects', 'Glucose Transporter Type 1/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/*enzymology', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Protein Kinases/*metabolism', 'Proteins/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Rapamycin-Insensitive Companion of mTOR Protein', 'Regulatory-Associated Protein of mTOR', 'Ribosomal Protein S6 Kinases, 70-kDa/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/*drug effects', 'Sirolimus/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases', 'Transcription, Genetic/drug effects', 'U937 Cells']",,2006/12/21 09:00,2007/05/24 09:00,['2006/12/21 09:00'],"['2006/12/21 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/05/24 09:00 [medline]', '2006/12/21 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)41730-6 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2006-06-030833 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2007 Apr 15;109(8):3509-12. doi: 10.1182/blood-2006-06-030833.

Studies were done to determine the mechanism for the up-regulation of bcl-2 protein observed in CD19+ CLL cells compared with CD19+ B cells from healthy volunteers. The 11-fold higher level of bcl-2 protein in CLL cells was positively correlated with a 26-fold elevation in the cytosolic level of nucleolin, a bcl2 mRNA-stabilizing protein. Measurements of the bcl2 heterogeneous nuclear/bcl2 mRNA (hnRNA)/mRNA ratios and the rates of bcl2 mRNA decay in cell extracts indicated that the 3-fold higher steady-state level of bcl2 mRNA in CLL cells was the result of increased bcl2 mRNA stability. Nucleolin was present throughout the nucleus and cytoplasm of CLL cells, whereas in normal B cells nucleolin was only detected in the nucleus. The addition of recombinant human nucleolin to extracts of normal B cells markedly slowed the rate of bcl2 mRNA decay. SiRNA knockdown of nucleolin in MCF-7 cells resulted in decreased levels of bcl2mRNA and protein but no change in beta-actin. These results indicate that bcl-2 overexpression in CLL cells is related to stabilization of bcl2 mRNA by nucleolin.","['Otake, Yoko', 'Soundararajan, Sridharan', 'Sengupta, Tapas K', 'Kio, Ebenezer A', 'Smith, James C', 'Pineda-Roman, Mauricio', 'Stuart, Robert K', 'Spicer, Eleanor K', 'Fernandes, Daniel J']","['Otake Y', 'Soundararajan S', 'Sengupta TK', 'Kio EA', 'Smith JC', 'Pineda-Roman M', 'Stuart RK', 'Spicer EK', 'Fernandes DJ']","['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Medical University of South Carolina, Charleston, SC 29425, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Phosphoproteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (RNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (nucleolin)']",IM,"['B-Lymphocytes/drug effects/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Nucleus/metabolism', 'Cytoplasm/metabolism', 'Female', 'Gene Expression', '*Genes, bcl-2', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Phosphoproteins/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'RNA Stability', 'RNA, Messenger/*genetics/*metabolism', 'RNA, Small Interfering/genetics', 'RNA-Binding Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'Recombinant Proteins/genetics/pharmacology']",,2006/12/21 09:00,2007/06/01 09:00,['2006/12/21 09:00'],"['2006/12/21 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/06/01 09:00 [medline]', '2006/12/21 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)41814-2 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2006-08-043257 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2007 Apr 1;109(7):3069-75. doi: 10.1182/blood-2006-08-043257.,,,,,PMC1852223,,"['R01 CA083925/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA109254/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA109254/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA83925/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Medications for hematologic diseases have the potential to modulate these complications if they alter blood cell deformability. Here we report the effect of chemotherapy on leukemia cell mechanical properties. Acute lymphoblastic and acute myeloid leukemia cells were incubated with standard induction chemotherapy, and individual cell stiffness was tracked with atomic force microscopy. When exposed to dexamethasone or daunorubicin, leukemia cell stiffness increased by nearly 2 orders of magnitude, which decreased their passage through microfluidic channels. This stiffness increase occurred before caspase activation and peaked after completion of cell death, and the rate of stiffness increase depended on chemotherapy type. Stiffening with cell death occurred for all cell types investigated and may be due to dynamic changes in the actin cytoskeleton. These observations suggest that chemotherapy itself may increase the risk of vascular complications in acute leukemia.","['Lam, Wilbur A', 'Rosenbluth, Michael J', 'Fletcher, Daniel A']","['Lam WA', 'Rosenbluth MJ', 'Fletcher DA']","['Department of Pediatrics, Division of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, University of California-San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20061219,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Actins)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,"['Actins/metabolism', 'Cytoskeleton/metabolism/ultrastructure', 'Daunorubicin/adverse effects/*pharmacology', 'Dexamethasone/adverse effects/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/complications/*drug therapy/metabolism/*pathology', 'Microfluidic Analytical Techniques', 'Microscopy, Atomic Force', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/complications/*drug therapy/metabolism/*pathology', 'Vascular Diseases/chemically induced']",,2006/12/21 09:00,2007/05/24 09:00,['2006/12/21 09:00'],"['2006/12/21 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/05/24 09:00 [medline]', '2006/12/21 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)41729-X [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2006-08-043570 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2007 Apr 15;109(8):3505-8. doi: 10.1182/blood-2006-08-043570.

The purpose was to outline measures needed to improve the outcome. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We analyzed our population-based 20-year data on 3,385 Nordic children with ALL treated on Nordic Society for Pediatric Hematology and Oncology ALL protocols, and described the flow of these patients through relapses, remissions, and deaths as a result of toxicity, demonstrating where major patient losses occurred. RESULTS: In total, 854 patients (25%) had a first and 274 patients (8%) had a second ALL relapse. P for survival after the first relapse was .35 +/- .02. The induction mortality (2.2%, primary; 10.3%, first relapse; 26.3%, second relapse) and remission mortality (1%, first complete remission [1CR]; 19%, second CR [2CR]) were significant; transplantation-related mortality (TRM) only represented 15% (69 of 459) of the deaths as a result of toxicity. Of the 766 patients entering 2CR, 29% underwent transplantation (P for survival, .46 +/- .04), whereas 71% continued receiving chemotherapy (P for survival, .39 +/- .02). Children with stem-cell transplantation indications in 2CR, if they did not undergo transplantation, generally died or had a second relapse. The patient groups that underwent transplantation in 1CR (n = 84), 2CR (n = 220), and > or = 3CR (n = 62) represented different risk profiles. Those with allogeneic stem-cell transplantation (allo-SCT) in > or = 3CR (P for survival, .37 +/- .07) had an ALL and first relapse with favorable features. CONCLUSION: Major patient losses occurred through mortality as a result of toxicity and resistant disease during the pathways before allo-SCT. After relapse, more patients were lost to mortality as a result of toxicity during conventional chemotherapy compared with TRM. After second relapse, the chance for rescue by allo-SCT in 3CR was minimal. The question of whether transplantation is recommended after ALL relapse should be carefully addressed, and more efficient relapse protocols should be launched.","['Saarinen-Pihkala, Ulla M', 'Heilmann, Carsten', 'Winiarski, Jacek', 'Glomstein, Anders', 'Abrahamsson, Jonas', 'Arvidson, Johan', 'Bekassy, Albert N', 'Forestier, Erik', 'Jonmundsson, Gudmundur', 'Schroeder, Henrik', 'Vettenranta, Kim', 'Wesenberg, Finn', 'Gustafsson, Goran']","['Saarinen-Pihkala UM', 'Heilmann C', 'Winiarski J', 'Glomstein A', 'Abrahamsson J', 'Arvidson J', 'Bekassy AN', 'Forestier E', 'Jonmundsson G', 'Schroeder H', 'Vettenranta K', 'Wesenberg F', 'Gustafsson G']","['Hospital for Children and Adolescents, University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland. ulla.pihkala@hus.fi']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Female', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*mortality/*surgery', 'Recurrence', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Scandinavian and Nordic Countries/epidemiology', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",,2006/12/21 09:00,2007/01/09 09:00,['2006/12/21 09:00'],"['2006/12/21 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/01/09 09:00 [medline]', '2006/12/21 09:00 [entrez]']","['24/36/5750 [pii]', '10.1200/JCO.2006.07.1225 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2006 Dec 20;24(36):5750-62. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2006.07.1225.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: In the ALL-Berlin-Frankfurt-Munster (BFM) 90 and ALL-BFM 95 trials, 387 patients were eligible for SCT if there was a matched sibling donor (MSD). T-cell ALL (T-ALL) patients with poor in vivo response to initial treatment represented the largest homogeneous subgroup within VHR patients. RESULTS: Of 191 high-risk (HR) T-ALL patients, 179 patients (94%) achieved CR1. Twenty-three patients received an MSD-SCT. Furthermore, in trial ALL-BFM 95, eight matched unrelated donors (MUDs) and five mismatched family donors (MMFDs) were used. The median time to SCT was 5 months (range, 2.4 to 10.8 months) from diagnosis. The 5-year disease-free survival (DFS) was 67% +/- 8% for 36 patients who received an SCT in CR1 and 42% +/- 5% for the 120 patients treated with chemotherapy alone having an event-free survival time of at least the median time to transplantation (Mantel-Byar, P = .01). Overall survival (OS) rate for the SCT group was 67% +/- 8% at 5 years, whereas patients treated with chemotherapy alone had an OS rate of 47% +/- 5% at 5 years (Mantel-Byar, P = .01). Outcome of patients who received MSD-SCT versus MUD-/MMFD-SCT was comparable (DFS, 65% +/- 10% v 69% +/- 13%, respectively). However, relapses only occurred after MSD-SCT (eight of 23 patients), whereas treatment-related mortality only occurred after MUD-/MMFD-SCT (four of 13 patients).

A very large mediastinal mass ( 50% of the maximal thoracic diameter) was associated with a 10-year event-free survival of 50% (SE, 14%) compared with 91% (SE, 4.0%) for smaller masses (P < .001). Late cardiopulmonary toxicity is largely absent, and the incidence of hypothyroidism is 14%. There have been no cases of secondary leukemia and four secondary solid malignancies observed to date. CONCLUSION: MOPP/ABV and low-dose, extended-field radiotherapy is an effective treatment for pediatric Hodgkin's lymphoma. With median follow-up of 8.5 years, late cardiopulmonary effects and secondary malignancies from this treatment regimen are infrequent. Continued longitudinal observations, particularly for breast cancer in female patients and gonadotoxicity, will determine whether the goal of decreasing treatment-related complications while maintaining excellent survival has been achieved.","['Chow, Lionel M L', 'Nathan, Paul C', 'Hodgson, David C', 'Jenkin, Derek', 'Weitzman, Sheila', 'Grant, Ronald M', 'Manson, David', 'Bross, Adee', 'Doyle, John J', 'Danjoux, Cyril', 'Greenberg, Mark L']","['Chow LM', 'Nathan PC', 'Hodgson DC', 'Jenkin D', 'Weitzman S', 'Grant RM', 'Manson D', 'Bross A', 'Doyle JJ', 'Danjoux C', 'Greenberg ML']","['Division of Haematology & Oncology, Department of Paediatrics, Toronto Sunnybrook Regional Cancer Centre, The Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,"['11056-06-7 (Bleomycin)', '35S93Y190K (Procarbazine)', '50D9XSG0VR (Mechlorethamine)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '5V9KLZ54CY (Vinblastine)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', 'VB0R961HZT (Prednisone)', 'MOPP-ABV protocol']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Bleomycin/administration & dosage', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Doxorubicin/administration & dosage', 'Female', 'Heart/drug effects', 'Hodgkin Disease/*drug therapy/*radiotherapy', 'Humans', 'Hypothyroidism/etiology', 'Infant', 'Lung/drug effects', 'Male', 'Mechlorethamine/administration & dosage', 'Prednisone/administration & dosage', 'Procarbazine/administration & dosage', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Analysis', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Vinblastine/administration & dosage', 'Vincristine/administration & dosage']",,2006/12/21 09:00,2007/01/09 09:00,['2006/12/21 09:00'],"['2006/12/21 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/01/09 09:00 [medline]', '2006/12/21 09:00 [entrez]']","['24/36/5735 [pii]', '10.1200/JCO.2006.05.6879 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2006 Dec 20;24(36):5735-41. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2006.05.6879.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The histone deacetylase complex Rpd3S is recruited to chromatin via binding of the chromodomain protein Eaf3 to methylated H3-K36 to prevent erroneous transcription initiation. Here we identify a distinct function for H3-K36 methylation. We used random mutagenesis of histones H3 and H4 followed by a reporter-based screen to identify residues necessary to prevent the ectopic spread of silencing from the silent mating-type locus HMRa into flanking euchromatin. Mutations in H3-K36 or deletion of SET2 caused ectopic silencing of a heterochromatin-adjacent reporter. Transcriptional profiling revealed that telomere-proximal genes are enriched for those that display decreased expression in a set2Delta strain. Deletion of SIR4 rescued the expression defect of 26 of 37 telomere-proximal genes with reduced expression in set2Delta cells, implying that H3-K36 methylation prevents the spread of telomeric silencing. Indeed, Sir3 spreads from heterochromatin into neighboring euchromatin in set2Delta cells. Furthermore, genetic experiments demonstrated that cells lacking the Rpd3S-specific subunits Eaf3 or Rco1 did not display the anti-silencing phenotype of mutations in SET2 or H3-K36. Thus, antagonism of silencing is independent of the only known effector of this conserved histone modification.","['Tompa, Rachel', 'Madhani, Hiten D']","['Tompa R', 'Madhani HD']","['Department of Biochemistry and Biophysics, University of California, San Francisco, California 94143-2200, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",20061218,United States,Genetics,Genetics,0374636,"['0 (Euchromatin)', '0 (Histones)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Saccharomyces cerevisiae Proteins)', '0 (Silent Information Regulator Proteins, Saccharomyces cerevisiae)', 'EC 2.1.1.- (Methyltransferases)', 'EC 2.1.1.- (Set2 protein, S cerevisiae)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Dot1 protein, S cerevisiae)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)', 'EC 3.5.1.- (RPD3 protein, S cerevisiae)', 'EC 3.5.1.98 (Histone Deacetylases)', 'K3Z4F929H6 (Lysine)']",IM,"['Euchromatin/metabolism', '*Gene Silencing', 'Genes, Dominant', 'Genes, Mating Type, Fungal', 'Genetic Testing', 'Histone Deacetylases/*metabolism', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase', 'Histones/genetics/*metabolism', 'Lysine/*metabolism', 'Methylation', 'Methyltransferases/metabolism', 'Nuclear Proteins/metabolism', 'Point Mutation/genetics', 'Protein Binding', 'Regulatory Sequences, Nucleic Acid/genetics', 'Saccharomyces cerevisiae/cytology/*enzymology/*genetics', 'Saccharomyces cerevisiae Proteins/*metabolism', 'Silent Information Regulator Proteins, Saccharomyces cerevisiae/metabolism', 'Telomere/metabolism']",,2006/12/21 09:00,2007/05/04 09:00,['2006/12/21 09:00'],"['2006/12/21 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/05/04 09:00 [medline]', '2006/12/21 09:00 [entrez]']","['genetics.106.067751 [pii]', '10.1534/genetics.106.067751 [doi]']",ppublish,Genetics. 2007 Feb;175(2):585-93. doi: 10.1534/genetics.106.067751.

Identification of the BCR-ABL kinase fusion protein and its central role in the pathogenesis of CML provided new opportunities to develop rational molecular targeted therapies. This review provides an update on the underlying pathophysiologies of disease progression and imatinib mesylate resistance, leading to the development of new targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitors for managing CML. Imatinib, a selective inhibitor of BCR-ABL, represents a major success in the era of target-directed cancer chemotherapy. However, patients with advanced CML have been less sensitive to therapy and responses have been short. In addition, treatment resistance is an emerging problem at all disease stages. Insight into factors involved in imatinib resistance and disease progression has highlighted a role for such BCR-ABL-dependent factors as amplification and overexpression of the BCR-ABL gene and the emergence of mutant isoforms of BCR-ABL. However, BCR-ABL-independent factors, including leukemogenic pathways involving kinases other than BCR-ABL, also play a part. In light of the limitations of imatinib against these factors, newer tyrosine kinase inhibitors, including dasatinib (a multitargeted kinase inhibitor of BCR-ABL and Src family kinases) and nilotinib (AMN107, a selective BCR-ABL inhibitor), may provide promising treatment options for patients with CML.","['Kantarjian, Hagop M', 'Talpaz, Moshe', 'Giles, Francis', ""O'Brien, Susan"", 'Cortes, Jorge']","['Kantarjian HM', 'Talpaz M', 'Giles F', ""O'Brien S"", 'Cortes J']","['Department of Leukemia, MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas 77030, USA. hkantarj@mdanderson.org']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,Ann Intern Med,Annals of internal medicine,0372351,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (src-Family Kinases)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Benzamides', 'Disease Progression', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/antagonists & inhibitors/physiology', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/genetics/*physiopathology', 'Piperazines/*therapeutic use', 'Pyrimidines/*therapeutic use', 'src-Family Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors']",103,2006/12/21 09:00,2007/01/11 09:00,['2006/12/21 09:00'],"['2006/12/21 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/01/11 09:00 [medline]', '2006/12/21 09:00 [entrez]']","['145/12/913 [pii]', '10.7326/0003-4819-145-12-200612190-00008 [doi]']",ppublish,Ann Intern Med. 2006 Dec 19;145(12):913-23. doi: 10.7326/0003-4819-145-12-200612190-00008.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we show that retroviral-mediated enforced expression of the NUP98-HOXA9 fusion protein in cord blood-derived CD34(+) cells confers a proliferative advantage in both cytokine-stimulated suspension cultures and stromal coculture. This advantage is reflected in the selective expansion of hematopoietic stem cells as measured in vitro by cobblestone area-forming cell assays and in vivo by competitive repopulation of nonobese diabetic/severe combined immunodeficient mice. NUP98-HOXA9 expression inhibited erythroid progenitor differentiation and delayed neutrophil maturation in transduced progenitors but strongly enhanced their serial replating efficiency. Analysis of the transcriptosome of transduced cells revealed up-regulation of several homeobox genes of the A and B cluster as well as of Meis1 and Pim-1 and down-modulation of globin genes and of CAAT/enhancer binding protein alpha. The latter gene, when coexpressed with NUP98-HOXA9, reversed the enhanced proliferation of transduced CD34(+) cells. Unlike HOXA9, the NUP98-HOXA9 fusion was protected from ubiquitination mediated by Cullin-4A and subsequent proteasome-dependent degradation. The resulting protein stabilization may contribute to the leukemogenic activity of the fusion protein.","['Chung, Ki Y', 'Morrone, Giovanni', 'Schuringa, Jan Jacob', 'Plasilova, Magdalena', 'Shieh, Jae-Hung', 'Zhang, Yue', 'Zhou, Pengbo', 'Moore, Malcolm A S']","['Chung KY', 'Morrone G', 'Schuringa JJ', 'Plasilova M', 'Shieh JH', 'Zhang Y', 'Zhou P', 'Moore MA']","['Department of Medicine and Moore Laboratory, Cell Biology Program, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY 10021, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (Mutant Chimeric Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Pore Complex Proteins)', '0 (Nup98 protein, human)', '0 (homeobox protein HOXA9)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD/physiology', 'Antigens, CD34/*physiology', 'Cell Division', 'Cell Line', 'Chromosome Mapping', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 11', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 7', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'Fetal Blood', 'Gene Fusion', 'Genetic Vectors', 'Homeodomain Proteins/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Mutant Chimeric Proteins/*genetics', 'Nuclear Pore Complex Proteins/*genetics', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Retroviridae/genetics', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Stem Cells/*cytology', 'Translocation, Genetic', 'Umbilical Cord']",,2006/12/21 09:00,2007/01/26 09:00,['2006/12/21 09:00'],"['2006/12/21 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/01/26 09:00 [medline]', '2006/12/21 09:00 [entrez]']","['66/24/11781 [pii]', '10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-06-0706 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 2006 Dec 15;66(24):11781-91. doi: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-06-0706.,,,,,,,"['CA092210/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA118085/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Virological study for PB19 included determination of specific IgG & IgM together with viral DNA by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). In all groups of patients with positive markers for PB19, there were statistically significant differences in the mean Hb concentration and RBC count (P < 0.001 for each), presence of neutropenia (P = 0.003) and lymphocytosis (P < 0.001) compared to controls.

However, in group IV IgM had the highest positive rate (50%) followed by PCR (45%) then IgG (40%). In conclusion, PB19 infection is detected in high rates among children with hematological disorders. PB19 must be suspected and screened for when there is anemia in those patients associated with neutropenia and lymphocytosis. In patients with acute leukaemia under chemotherapy who have unexpected anemia, neutropenia and lymphocytosis Parvovirus infection should be considered before a change of chemotherapy protocol.

Analysis of clonal T cell receptor (TCR) rearrangement and complementarity determining region 3 (CDR3) of the TCR beta-chain is a useful tool to investigate clonal expansions, track the frequency of expanded clones and also clinically useful to monitor the response to therapy. The lessons learned from molecular analysis of clonal repertoire support a clinically-derived conclusion that the LGL clone arises in the context of an initially polyclonal immune response or an autoimmune process. Consequently, specific manifestations of T-LGL may be a result of the recognition spectrum of the transformed clone and the cytokines it produces. Due to the often monoclonal manifestation, T-LGL constitutes a suitable model to investigate polyclonal CTL-mediated processes. Application of new technologies, including TCR repertoire analysis by sequencing, clonotypic quantitative PCR and VB flow cytometry facilitate clinical diagnosis and may allow insights into the regulation of TCR repertoire and consequences resulting from the contraction of clonal diversity.","['Wlodarski, Marcin W', 'Schade, Andrew E', 'Maciejewski, Jaroslaw P']","['Wlodarski MW', 'Schade AE', 'Maciejewski JP']","['Experimental Hematology and Hematopoiesis Section, Taussig Cancer Center, Cleveland Clinic Foundation, Cleveland, OH, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,England,Hematology,"Hematology (Amsterdam, Netherlands)",9708388,"['0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Autoimmune Diseases/epidemiology', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/pathology', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/pathology', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/genetics', 'Cell Transformation, Viral', 'Clone Cells/pathology', 'Comorbidity', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Gene Rearrangement, T-Lymphocyte/genetics', 'Herpesviridae Infections/complications', 'Humans', 'Killer Cells, Natural/pathology', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/diagnosis/epidemiology/*genetics/pathology/physiopathology/virology', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Leukocytosis/diagnosis', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Lymphoproliferative Disorders/epidemiology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/*genetics', 'Retroviridae Infections/complications', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/pathology', 'Tumor Virus Infections/epidemiology']",132,2006/12/21 09:00,2007/03/07 09:00,['2006/12/21 09:00'],"['2006/12/21 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/03/07 09:00 [medline]', '2006/12/21 09:00 [entrez]']","['W14320050464241K [pii]', '10.1080/10245330600774793 [doi]']",ppublish,Hematology. 2006 Aug;11(4):245-56. doi: 10.1080/10245330600774793.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Fifteen patients presented at the Centro de Hematologia y Medicina Interna de Puebla from February 1995 to August 2005; only nine were treated and followed in the institution. Median age was 24 years, (range 7-49); there was only one male.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: The cancer risks were compared with those populations with the same temporal and geographic characteristics in Taiwan by standardized incidence ratios (SIR), adjusted for age and gender. The association of cancer risks with excess cumulative exposure was further evaluated for their relative risks by the Poisson multiple regression analysis. RESULT: A total of 7271 people were registered as the exposed population, with 101,560 person-years at risk. The average excess cumulative exposure was approximately 47.8 mSv (range < 1 - 2,363 mSv). A total of 141 exposed subjects with various cancers were observed, while 95 developed leukemia or solid cancers after more than 2 or 10 years initial residence in contaminated buildings respectively. The SIR were significantly higher for all leukemia except chronic lymphocytic leukemia (n = 6, SIR = 3.6, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.2 - 7.4) in men, and marginally significant for thyroid cancers (n = 6, SIR = 2.6, 95% CI 1.0 - 5.7) in women. On the other hand, all cancers combined, all solid cancers combined were shown to exhibit significant exposure-dependent increased risks in individuals with the initial exposure before the age of 30, but not beyond this age.

Between 20 and 40 microM of six PUFAs (omega-6 series: arachidonic acid [AA, C20:4], gamma-linolenic acid [gamma-LN, C18:3] and linoleic acid [LA, C18:2]; omega-3 series: alpha-linolenic acids [alpha-LN, C18:3] and eicosapentaenoic acid [EPA, C20:5]; and omega-9 series: oleic acid [OLE, C18:1]), or two saturated fatty acids (stearic acid [STA, C18:0] and arachidic acid [AD, C20:0]) were used to examine the effects on calcium response and degranulation from RBL-2H3 cells. Calcium response was monitored using the fluorescent calcium indicator fura-2, while degranulation was monitored by measuring histamine release from the cells. Three omega-6 PUFAs (AA, alpha-LN and LA) dose-dependently increased the cytosolic free-calcium concentration and histamine release from RBL-2H3 cells. This phenomenon was specific to the omega-6 PUFAs, the omega-3 PUFAs (alpha-LA and EPA), omega-9 PUFA (OLE) and the saturated fatty acids (STA and AD) had no effect. The increase in the cytosolic free-calcium concentration caused by the omega-6 PUFAs depended on the existence of external calcium, cell viability and the cellular IP(3) levels remained unchanged throughout the experiment. These results suggest that omega-6 PUFAs work as direct mediators of calcium signaling pathways in RBL-2H3 cells.","['Teshima, Reiko', 'Amano, Fumio', 'Nakamura, Ryosuke', 'Tanaka, Yasuhiko', 'Sawada, Jun-ichi']","['Teshima R', 'Amano F', 'Nakamura R', 'Tanaka Y', 'Sawada J']","['Division of Biochemistry and Immunochemistry, National Institute of Health Sciences, 1-18-1 Kamiyoga, Tokyo, Japan. rteshima@nihs.go.jp']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20061023,Netherlands,Int Immunopharmacol,International immunopharmacology,100965259,"['0 (Anti-Allergic Agents)', '0 (Fatty Acids, Unsaturated)', '85166-31-0 (Inositol 1,4,5-Trisphosphate)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Anti-Allergic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Calcium/*metabolism', 'Cell Degranulation/*drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Fatty Acids, Unsaturated/*pharmacology', 'Histamine Release/*drug effects', 'Inositol 1,4,5-Trisphosphate/metabolism', 'Rats', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects']",,2006/12/21 09:00,2007/03/22 09:00,['2006/12/21 09:00'],"['2006/09/04 00:00 [received]', '2006/09/21 00:00 [revised]', '2006/09/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2006/12/21 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/03/22 09:00 [medline]', '2006/12/21 09:00 [entrez]']","['S1567-5769(06)00296-7 [pii]', '10.1016/j.intimp.2006.09.017 [doi]']",ppublish,Int Immunopharmacol. 2007 Feb;7(2):205-10. doi: 10.1016/j.intimp.2006.09.017.

METHODS: HL-60 cells were treated with different concentrations of VEGF (2 microg/L, 20 microg/L or 100 microg/L ) or 20 mg/L of etoposide (VP16, an apoptosis inducter) alone or VEGF plus VP16. After 18 hrs of treatment, the apoptosis rate of HL-60 cells was detected by single-cell gel electrophoresis and flow cytometry. The expressions of Bcl-2 and Mcl-1 of HL-60 cells were detected by RT-PCR. The Control group did not receive any treatment. Immunocytochemistry was used to detect the VEGF and Mcl-1 protein in bone marrow cells from 8 patients with newly diagnosed or relapsed leukemia, 14 leukemia patients in complete remission, and from 5 normal children. RESULTS: Different concentrations of VEGF markedly inhibited the apoptosis of HL-60 cells and decreased the apoptosis induced by VP16 exposure. The Bcl-2 and Mcl-1 mRNA and protein in HL-60 cells treated with VEGF were significantly higher than those in the Control group. The expressions of VEGF and Mcl-1 protein in bone marrow cells of the newly diagnosed and relapsed patients were significantly higher than in patients in complete remission. CONCLUSION: VEGF can inhibit the apoptosis of HL-60 cells possibly through increasing the expressions of Bcl-2 and Mcl-1 mRNA and protein, which may represent one of the mechanisms responsible for human acute leukemia.

We have previously demonstrated, using a mouse cancer model, that oncogenic tyrosine kinase inhibition of DNA damage-induced Bcl-xL deamidation tightly correlates with T cell transformation in vivo, although the pathway to Bcl-xL deamidation remains unknown and its functional consequences unclear. We show here that rBcl-xL deamidation generates an iso-Asp(52)/iso-Asp(66) species that is unable to sequester pro-apoptotic BH3-only proteins such as Bim and Puma. DNA damage in thymocytes results in increased expression of the NHE-1 Na/H antiport, an event both necessary and sufficient for subsequent intracellular alkalinisation, Bcl-xL deamidation, and apoptosis. In murine thymocytes and tumour cells expressing an oncogenic tyrosine kinase, this DNA damage-induced cascade is blocked. Enforced intracellular alkalinisation mimics the effects of DNA damage in murine tumour cells and human B-lineage chronic lymphocytic leukaemia cells, thereby causing Bcl-xL deamidation and increased apoptosis. Our results define a signalling pathway leading from DNA damage to up-regulation of the NHE-1 antiport, to intracellular alkalanisation to Bcl-xL deamidation, to apoptosis, representing the first example, to our knowledge, of how deamidation of internal asparagine residues can be regulated in a protein in vivo. Our findings also suggest novel approaches to cancer therapy.","['Zhao, Rui', 'Oxley, David', 'Smith, Trevor S', 'Follows, George A', 'Green, Anthony R', 'Alexander, Denis R']","['Zhao R', 'Oxley D', 'Smith TS', 'Follows GA', 'Green AR', 'Alexander DR']","['Laboratory of Lymphocyte Signalling and Development, The Babraham Institute, Babraham, Cambridge, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,PLoS Biol,PLoS biology,101183755,"['0 (Amides)', '0 (Cation Transport Proteins)', '0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Slc9a1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Sodium-Hydrogen Exchanger 1)', '0 (Sodium-Hydrogen Exchangers)', '0 (bcl-X Protein)']",IM,"['Amides/*metabolism', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Apoptosis', 'Base Sequence', 'Cation Transport Proteins/*physiology', 'Cell Line', '*DNA Damage', 'DNA Primers', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'Humans', '*Hydrogen-Ion Concentration', 'Membrane Proteins/*physiology', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sodium-Hydrogen Exchanger 1', 'Sodium-Hydrogen Exchangers/*physiology', 'bcl-X Protein/*genetics']",,2006/12/21 09:00,2007/10/12 09:00,['2006/12/21 09:00'],"['2006/06/06 00:00 [received]', '2006/10/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2006/12/21 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/10/12 09:00 [medline]', '2006/12/21 09:00 [entrez]']","['06-PLBI-RA-0968R2 [pii]', '10.1371/journal.pbio.0050001 [doi]']",ppublish,PLoS Biol. 2007 Jan;5(1):e1. doi: 10.1371/journal.pbio.0050001.,,['PLoS Biol. 2007 Jan;5(1):e10.

The convergent approach relied on a key epoxide-opening reaction to join the two stereotriad units and a single-step late-stage stereoselective installation of the sensitive (Z,Z,E)-triene through a beta-chelation-controlled nucleophilic addition. The synthetic route provided rapid access to the C4-C6 stereoisomers of the cytostatin lactone, which were prepared and used to define the C4-C6 relative stereochemistry of the natural product. In addition to the natural product, each of the C10-C11 diastereomers of cytostatin was divergently prepared (11 steps from key convergence step) by this route and used to unequivocally confirm the relative and absolute stereochemistry of cytostatin. Each of the cytostatin diastereomers exhibited a reduced activity toward inhibition of PP2A (>100-fold), demonstrating the importance of the presence and stereochemistry of the C10-methyl and C11-hydroxy groups for potent PP2A inhibition. Extensions of the studies provided dephosphocytostatin, sulfocytostatin (a key analogue related to the natural product sultriecin), 11-deshydroxycytostatin, and an analogue lacking the entire C12-C18 (Z,Z,E)-triene segment, which were used to define the magnitude of the C9-phosphate (>4000-fold), C11-alcohol (250-fold), and triene (220-fold) contribution to PP2A inhibition. A model of cytostatin bound to the active site of PP2A is presented, compared to that of fostriecin, which is also presented in detail for the first time, and used to provide insights into the role of the key substituents. Notably, the alpha,beta unsaturated lactone of cytostatin, like that of fostriecin, is projected to serve as a key electrophile, providing a covalent adduct with Cys269 unique to PP2A, contributing to its potency (> or =200-fold for fostriecin) and accounting for its selectivity.","['Lawhorn, Brian G', 'Boga, Sobhana B', 'Wolkenberg, Scott E', 'Colby, David A', 'Gauss, Carla-Maria', 'Swingle, Mark R', 'Amable, Lauren', 'Honkanen, Richard E', 'Boger, Dale L']","['Lawhorn BG', 'Boga SB', 'Wolkenberg SE', 'Colby DA', 'Gauss CM', 'Swingle MR', 'Amable L', 'Honkanen RE', 'Boger DL']","['Department of Chemistry and The Skaggs Institute for Chemical Biology, The Scripps Research Institute, 10550 North Torrey Pines Road, La Jolla, CA 92037, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",,United States,J Am Chem Soc,Journal of the American Chemical Society,7503056,"['0 (Alkenes)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Organophosphates)', '0 (Polyenes)', '0 (Pyrones)', '156856-30-3 (cytostatin)', 'EC 3.1.3.16 (Phosphoprotein Phosphatases)', 'ZO1648L551 (fostriecin)']",IM,"['Alkenes/pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*chemical synthesis/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia L1210', 'Mice', 'Models, Molecular', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Organophosphates/*chemical synthesis/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Phosphoprotein Phosphatases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Polyenes', 'Pyrones/*chemical synthesis/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Stereoisomerism', 'Structure-Activity Relationship']",,2006/12/21 09:00,2007/02/21 09:00,['2006/12/21 09:00'],"['2006/12/21 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/02/21 09:00 [medline]', '2006/12/21 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1021/ja066477d [doi]'],ppublish,J Am Chem Soc. 2006 Dec 27;128(51):16720-32. doi: 10.1021/ja066477d.,,,,,PMC2566737,,"['R01 CA093456-04/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA042056/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA093456/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA042056-23/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 42056/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 93456/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",['NIHMS59201'],,,,,,,,,,,

The intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis is probably the most commonly used method in a RCT with non-compliance. However, the ITT analysis estimates 'the programmatic effectiveness' rather than 'the biological efficacy'. In this paper, we focus attention on the latter index and consider use of the risk difference (RD) to measure the effect of a treatment. Based on a simple additive risk model proposed elsewhere, we develop four asymptotic interval estimators of the RD for repeated binary measurements in a RCT with non-compliance. We apply Monte Carlo simulation to evaluate and compare the finite-sample performance of these interval estimators in a variety of situations. We find that all interval estimators considered here can perform well with respect to the coverage probability. We further find that the interval estimator using a tanh(-1)(x) transformation is probably more precise than the others, while the interval estimator derived from a randomization-based approach may cause a slight loss of precision. When the number of patients per treatment is large and the probability of compliance to an assigned treatment is high, we find that all interval estimators discussed here are essentially equivalent. Finally, we illustrate use of these interval estimators with data simulated from a trial of using macrophage colony-stimulating factor to reduce febrile neutropenia incidence in acute myeloid leukaemia patients.","['Lui, Kung-Jong']",['Lui KJ'],"['Department of Mathematics and Statistics, College of Sciences, San Diego State University, San Diego, CA 92182-7720, USA. kjl@rohan.sdsu.edu']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,England,Stat Med,Statistics in medicine,8215016,,IM,"['Humans', 'Models, Statistical', 'Monte Carlo Method', 'Patient Compliance/*statistics & numerical data', 'Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic/*statistics & numerical data', 'Risk Assessment', 'United States']",,2006/12/21 09:00,2007/08/28 09:00,['2006/12/21 09:00'],"['2006/12/21 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/08/28 09:00 [medline]', '2006/12/21 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/sim.2789 [doi]'],ppublish,Stat Med. 2007 Jul 20;26(16):3140-56. doi: 10.1002/sim.2789.,,,,,,"['(c) 2006 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

SHP-2 is composed by a catalytic (PTP) and two regulatory (N-SH2 and C-SH2) domains that bind to signaling partners and control the enzymatic activity by limiting the accessibility of the catalytic site. Wild type SHP-2 and four disease-associated mutants recurring in hematologic malignancies (Glu76Lys and Ala72Val) or causing NS (Glu76Asp and Ala72Ser), with affected residues located in the PTP-interacting region of the N-SH2 domain, were analyzed by molecular dynamics simulations and in vitro biochemical assays. Simulations demonstrate that mutations do not affect significantly the conformation of the N-SH2 domain. Rather they destabilize the interaction of this domain with the catalytic site, with more evident effects in the two leukemia associated mutants. Consistent with this structural evidence, mutants exhibit an increased level of basal phosphatase activity in the order Glu76Lys > Ala72Val > Glu76Asp > Ala72Ser > WT. The experimental data also show that the mutants with higher basal activity are more responsive to an activating phosphopeptide. A thermodynamic analysis demonstrates that an increase in the overall phosphopeptide affinity of mutants can be explained by a shift in the equilibrium between the inactive and active SHP-2 structure. These data support the view that an increase in the affinity of SHP-2 for its binding partners, caused by destabilization of the closed, inactive conformation, rather than protein basal activation per se, would represent the molecular mechanism, leading to pathogenesis in these mutants.","['Bocchinfuso, Gianfranco', 'Stella, Lorenzo', 'Martinelli, Simone', 'Flex, Elisabetta', 'Carta, Claudio', 'Pantaleoni, Francesca', 'Pispisa, Basilio', 'Venanzi, Mariano', 'Tartaglia, Marco', 'Palleschi, Antonio']","['Bocchinfuso G', 'Stella L', 'Martinelli S', 'Flex E', 'Carta C', 'Pantaleoni F', 'Pispisa B', 'Venanzi M', 'Tartaglia M', 'Palleschi A']","['Dipartimento di Scienze e Tecnologie Chimiche, Universita di Roma Tor Vergata, Rome, Italy.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Proteins,Proteins,8700181,"['0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '3KX376GY7L (Glutamic Acid)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (PTPN11 protein, human)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 11)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases)', 'OF5P57N2ZX (Alanine)']",IM,"['Alanine/genetics/*metabolism', 'Amino Acid Substitution', 'Binding Sites', 'Computer Simulation', 'Crystallography, X-Ray', 'Disease', 'Glutamic Acid/genetics/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/*chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Models, Molecular', 'Mutation/genetics', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 11', 'Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases/*chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Static Electricity']",,2006/12/21 09:00,2007/05/12 09:00,['2006/12/21 09:00'],"['2006/12/21 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/05/12 09:00 [medline]', '2006/12/21 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/prot.21050 [doi]'],ppublish,Proteins. 2007 Mar 1;66(4):963-74. doi: 10.1002/prot.21050.,,,,,,"['(c) 2006 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

The American Red Cross Cord Blood Program was established as a national network of cord blood banks. Nine thousand cord blood units were cryopreserved for transplant use. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: This report summarizes the experience with the first 125 cord blood units that have been distributed for transplant for 122 patients at 36 different transplant centers worldwide. Patients were treated with a variety of conditioning regimens. RESULTS: Most patients had acute myelogeneous leukemia (21%), genetic disorders (22%), or acute lymphoblastic leukemia (18%). The median age of the patients was 11 years with a range of 2 months to 63 years. The patients ranged in size from 3 to 120 kg (median, 39 kg). The median number of days to neutrophil engraftment was 22, and the median number of days to platelet engraftment was 63. Thirty percent of patients experienced Grades III to IV acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). Survival at 1 year after transplant was 35 percent, with recurrent disease the major cause of death. In multivariate analysis, only age less than 18 years was a significant predictor for improved survival. Forty-two percent of patients were non-Caucasian. Engraftment, GVHD, survival, and disease-free survival were similar among Caucasian and non-Caucasian patients. CONCLUSION: Umbilical cord blood serves as a satisfactory stem cell source for a diverse group of pediatric and adult patients.","['Ballen, Karen K', 'Haley, N Rebecca', 'Kurtzberg, Joanne', 'Lane, Thomas A', 'Lindgren, Bruce R', 'Miller, John P', 'Newman, Bruce', 'McCullough, Jeff']","['Ballen KK', 'Haley NR', 'Kurtzberg J', 'Lane TA', 'Lindgren BR', 'Miller JP', 'Newman B', 'McCullough J']","['American Red Cross Cord Blood Program, St Paul, Minnesota, USA. kballen@partners.org']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Transfusion,Transfusion,0417360,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', '*Blood Banks', 'Cause of Death', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', '*Cord Blood Stem Cell Transplantation/mortality', 'Graft vs Host Disease/etiology', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/mortality', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Middle Aged', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Rate']",,2006/12/21 09:00,2007/01/25 09:00,['2006/12/21 09:00'],"['2006/12/21 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/01/25 09:00 [medline]', '2006/12/21 09:00 [entrez]']","['TRF01032 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1537-2995.2006.01032.x [doi]']",ppublish,Transfusion. 2006 Dec;46(12):2063-70. doi: 10.1111/j.1537-2995.2006.01032.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We developed two platelet function tests to report the improved haemostasis in the transfused patients, which were capable of detecting aberrant responsiveness of the platelets after transfusion. First, in a whole-blood flow test, platelet adhesion and thrombus formation were determined under high-shear flow conditions. Second, the procoagulant function of platelets was assayed in platelet-rich plasma by measurement of thrombin generation. Experimental conditions were established, where flow-induced adhesion and thrombin generation test parameters increased semi-linearly with the platelet concentration, and informed on the activation properties of platelets. The transfusion effects were evaluated for 38 thrombocytopenic patients, who were transfused with platelets stored in plasma or in synthetic medium (platelet additive solution II). In most but not all patients, transfusion resulted in increased adhesion and thrombus formation, as well as in improved platelet-dependent coagulation. Taken together, the increase in platelet count after transfusion explained 57% of the overall improvement in platelet function. In acute graft-versus-host disease, thrombus formation was normal, while platelet-dependent coagulation was higher than expected. We conclude that assessment of flow-induced adhesion and thrombin generation in acquired thrombocytopenia adequately determines the improved haemostatic activity by transfused platelets.","['Cauwenberghs, Sandra', 'Feijge, Marion A H', 'Theunissen, Evi', 'Heemskerk, Johan W M', 'van Pampus, Elisabeth C M', 'Curvers, Joyce']","['Cauwenberghs S', 'Feijge MA', 'Theunissen E', 'Heemskerk JW', 'van Pampus EC', 'Curvers J']","['Department of Biochemistry (CARIM), Maastricht University, Maastricht, the Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20061214,England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,['EC 3.4.21.5 (Thrombin)'],IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Female', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/blood/*therapy', 'Hemostasis', 'Hodgkin Disease/blood/therapy', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/blood/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multiple Myeloma/blood/therapy', 'Platelet Activation', 'Platelet Aggregation', 'Platelet Function Tests', '*Platelet Transfusion', 'Thrombin/analysis/*biosynthesis', 'Thrombocytopenia', 'Thrombosis/*blood', 'Treatment Outcome']",,2006/12/21 09:00,2007/03/30 09:00,['2006/12/21 09:00'],"['2006/12/21 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/03/30 09:00 [medline]', '2006/12/21 09:00 [entrez]']","['BJH6453 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1365-2141.2006.06453.x [doi]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2007 Feb;136(3):480-90. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.2006.06453.x.

Despite the ubiquitous nature of this cellular reaction to neural injury, a little is known concerning the signaling mechanisms that initiate it. Recently, we demonstrated that astrocytic hypertrophy and enhanced expression of glial fibrillary acidic protein resulting from toxicant-induced neurodegeneration are linked to activation of the janus kinase (JAK)-signal transducer and activator of transcription-3 (STAT3) pathway. These observations implicate ligands at the gp130 receptor as potential upstream effectors of astrogliosis. Here we used the brain slice preparation to examine potential activators of the JAK-STAT3 pathway. Following incubation of freshly cut striatal slices in phosphate-free oxygenated buffer for up to 75 min, we found that slicing the striatum itself was a sufficient stimulus to initiate a rapid activation of the JAK-STAT3 pathway as assessed with immunoblots of pSTAT3((tyr705)) using phospho-state specific antibodies. The mRNA for the gp130 cytokines, leukemia inhibitory factor, interleukin-6 and oncostatin M or the beta-chemokine, monocyte chemoattractive protein (CCl2) also were up-regulated in the slice. Moreover, we could enhance the activation of STAT3((tyr705)) by adding exogenous cytokines to the slice and we could inhibit phosphorylation of STAT3((tyr705)) by addition of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (Lav A and AG490) or neutralizing antibodies directed against leukemia inhibitory factor or oncostatin M. These data suggest that STAT3 activation is an early event in slice-induced glial activation and establishes the brain slice preparation method as a reliable model to examine the signaling mechanisms that underlie glial activation.","['Damiani, Candice L', ""O'Callaghan, James P""]","['Damiani CL', ""O'Callaghan JP""]","['Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (CDC-NIOSH), Morgantown, WV 26505, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20061214,England,J Neurochem,Journal of neurochemistry,2985190R,"['0 (Antibodies)', '0 (Chemokines)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Glial Fibrillary Acidic Protein)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Stat3 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 1)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies/pharmacology', 'Astrocytes/*metabolism', 'Brain/*metabolism/physiopathology', 'Brain Injuries/*metabolism/physiopathology', 'Chemokines/metabolism', 'Cytokines/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects/physiology', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Female', 'Glial Fibrillary Acidic Protein/metabolism', 'Gliosis/*metabolism/physiopathology', 'Janus Kinase 1/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Models, Biological', 'Organ Culture Techniques', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/*physiology', 'Up-Regulation/physiology']",,2006/12/21 09:00,2007/03/21 09:00,['2006/12/21 09:00'],"['2006/12/21 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/03/21 09:00 [medline]', '2006/12/21 09:00 [entrez]']","['JNC4321 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1471-4159.2006.04321.x [doi]']",ppublish,J Neurochem. 2007 Feb;100(3):720-6. doi: 10.1111/j.1471-4159.2006.04321.x.

Glycans derived from MMP-9 expressed in MCF-7 breast cancer and THP-1 myeloid leukemia cells were compared with those from MMP-9 expressed in natural neutrophils. The many O-linked glycans of neutrophil gelatinase B presented a cluster of mainly galactosylated core II structures, 46% of which were ligands for galectin-3; 11% contained two to three N-acetyllactosamine repeating units that are high-affinity ligands for the lectin. The glycan epitopes thus provide MMP-9 with both high-affinity and (presumably) high-avidity interactions with galectin-3. In contrast, the O-glycans released from MMP-9 expressed in MCF-7 and THP-1 cells were predominantly sialylated core I structures. Only 10% of MCF-7 and THP-1 gelatinase B O-glycans were ligands for galectin-3 and contained only a maximum single N-acetyllactosamine repeat. Consistent with the glycan analysis, surface plasmon resonance binding assays indicated that the cancer-associated glycoforms of MMP-9 bound galectin-3 with an affinity and avidity significantly reduced compared with those of the natural neutrophil MMP-9. Galectin-3 exists as a multimer that also binds laminin, providing a means of localizing neutrophil MMP-9 in the extracellular matrix (ECM). The analytical data presented here suggest that MMP-9 glycoforms secreted by tumor cells are unlikely to be tethered at the site of secretion, thus promoting more extensive cleavage of the ECM and providing a rationale for the contribution that gelatinase B makes to cancer cell metastasis.","['Fry, Simon A', 'Van den Steen, Philippe E', 'Royle, Louise', 'Wormald, Mark R', 'Leathem, Anthony J', 'Opdenakker, Ghislain', 'McDonnell, James M', 'Dwek, Raymond A', 'Rudd, Pauline M']","['Fry SA', 'Van den Steen PE', 'Royle L', 'Wormald MR', 'Leathem AJ', 'Opdenakker G', 'McDonnell JM', 'Dwek RA', 'Rudd PM']","['Glycobiology Institute, Department of Biochemistry, University of Oxford, UK.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20061206,United States,Biochemistry,Biochemistry,0370623,"['0 (Galectin 3)', '0 (Isoenzymes)', '0 (Matrix Metalloproteinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Polysaccharides)', 'EC 3.4.24.35 (Matrix Metalloproteinase 9)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Breast Neoplasms/*enzymology/metabolism/pathology', 'Carbohydrate Conformation', 'Cattle', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Down-Regulation/*physiology', 'Extracellular Matrix/enzymology', 'Galectin 3/*metabolism', 'Glycosylation', 'Humans', 'Isoenzymes/antagonists & inhibitors/biosynthesis/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*enzymology/metabolism/pathology', 'Matrix Metalloproteinase 9/biosynthesis/*metabolism', '*Matrix Metalloproteinase Inhibitors', 'Neoplasm Invasiveness', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Neutrophils/enzymology', 'Polysaccharides/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Protein Binding', 'Surface Plasmon Resonance']",,2006/12/21 09:00,2008/01/12 09:00,['2006/12/21 09:00'],"['2006/12/21 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/01/12 09:00 [medline]', '2006/12/21 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1021/bi061254l [doi]'],ppublish,Biochemistry. 2006 Dec 26;45(51):15249-58. doi: 10.1021/bi061254l.

Older patients with AML are less likely to achieve complete remission after induction chemotherapy, and they suffer from higher rates of leukemia relapse compared to younger cohorts. Suboptimal outcomes are the result of adverse biologic characteristics of leukemia in the elderly, as well as the presence of medical comorbidities and patient or physician preferences as to initiating treatment. In addition, there is a distinct lack of randomized, prospective data to guide management decisions for the treatment of AML in the elderly. Patients who are over age 75, with poor performance status, multiple comorbidities, or poor prognostic features, should be considered for a clinical trial or palliative therapy. Elderly patients who are candidates for standard induction chemotherapy and achieve complete remission are unlikely to benefit from intensive postremission therapy and should be referred to a clinical trial when possible.

Using interphase multipoint FISH (mp-FISH), which was developed by our group, with 42 chromosome 3-specific probes, we detected clonal chromosome 3 aberrations in 4 T-cell ALL (T-ALL) cases. Four out of seven T-ALL cases carried 3q trisomies. One T-ALL case carried either trisomy 3 (in 15% of the cells) or a 23-megabase (Mb) 3p13 approximately p12 deletion in a different subpopulation of cells of 32%. Another T-ALL case had either 3q trisomy in 11% or a 12-Mb 3p12 approximately p13 deletion in 19% of the cells. The deletions were overlapping. In both cases, the majority of the bone marrow cells (47 and 70%, respectively) were normal chromosome 3 disomics. The interstitial deletions detected harbor a known homozygous deletion region between 72.6 and 78.8 Mb, which has been described in lung and breast tumors and contains the DUTT1/ROBO1 tumor suppressor gene. These deletions detected by mp-FISH would have remained unnoticed by conventional cytogenetics and multiplex FISH, as well as by current methods based on total tumor DNA analysis such as comparative genomic hybridization (CGH), array CGH, and loss of heterozygosity (LOH).","['Haltrich, Iren', 'Kost-Alimova, Maria', 'Kovacs, Gabor', 'Dobos, Matild', 'Klein, George', 'Fekete, Gyorgy', 'Imreh, Stefan']","['Haltrich I', 'Kost-Alimova M', 'Kovacs G', 'Dobos M', 'Klein G', 'Fekete G', 'Imreh S']","['Microbiology and Tumor Biology Center, Karolinska Institute, Nobelsvagen 16, Stockholm 17177, Sweden.

Specific chromosome abnormalities are associated with prognosis in childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia, but have not been evaluated for prognostic value in pediatric LBL. For the Children's Cancer Group protocol CCG-E-08 Etiologic Study of Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma in Childhood, 13 patients were enrolled with cytogenetic analysis of LBL and on treatment protocol CCG-502. Pathology material and karyotypes at initial diagnosis were given central review. The patients were aged 6-13 years (median 9 years), with a male-to-female ratio of 12:1. All patients had advanced disease. Disease relapsed in six patients (event-free survival 54% +/- 14%, median 10.8 years). Chromosome abnormalities were identified in 11 (85%), and translocations at 14q11.2 likely involving the T-cell receptor alpha/delta locus (TCR A/D) occurred in 4 (31%). For patients with relapse, four had translocations t(1;14)(p32;q11.2), t(8;14)(q24.1;q11.2), t(11;14)(p13;q11.2), or t(9;17)(q34;q23), involving breakpoints in the regions of TAL1, MYC, LMO2, and NOTCH1, respectively. Pediatric advanced LBLs have a high frequency of chromosome abnormalities; in this limited study, these often involved translocations at 14q11.2, the site of TCR A/D. Translocations possibly involving TAL1, MYC, LMO2, or NOTCH1 may have contributed to poor outcome.

T-cell clonality is confirmed by rearrangements of the T-cell receptor (TCR) gene. Characteristic features of T-LGL leukemia include neutropenia, anemia, and constitutional symptoms such as fatigue. Many solid organ transplant recipients experience similar symptoms and have neutropenia and anemia often attributed to immunosuppressive therapy. The purpose of this study was to determine the prevalence of T-LGL proliferation in solid organ transplant recipients and demonstrate its association with leukopenia and anemia. Twenty-three cardiac and renal transplant patients were evaluated by peripheral smear examination, flow cytometry, and TCR gene rearrangement study by polymerase chain reaction. Ten of 14 (71%) cardiac transplant patients and 4 of 9 (44%) renal transplant patients, without evidence of either allograft rejection or a viral syndrome, were found to have clonal expansion of T-LGL cells. Constitutional symptoms were present in 30% of these patients. Anemia of <10 g/dL was seen in 75% of renal transplant and 10% of cardiac transplant patients. None of these patients had significant neutropenia defined as absolute neutrophil count of 1500 mu/L. Most of the patients did not require any specific therapeutic intervention. Although TCR gene rearrangement is considered a hallmark of T-LGL leukemia, we believe that this monoclonality is not a true form of posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorder. Constant antigenic stimulus from the allograft may be the underlying etiology of clonal expansion and may contribute to cytopenias and fatigue seen in transplant patients.","['Sabnani, I', 'Zucker, M J', 'Tsang, P', 'Palekar, S']","['Sabnani I', 'Zucker MJ', 'Tsang P', 'Palekar S']","['Department of Oncology/Hematology, Newark Beth Israel Medical Center, Newark, New Jersey 07112, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Transplant Proc,Transplantation proceedings,0243532,['0 (CD3 Complex)'],IM,"['Anemia/immunology', 'CD3 Complex/immunology', 'Cell Division', 'Gene Rearrangement, T-Lymphocyte', 'Heart Transplantation/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Kidney Transplantation/*immunology', 'Leukopenia/immunology', '*Lymphocyte Activation', 'Postoperative Complications/immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology/pathology', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/immunology']",,2006/12/19 09:00,2007/05/01 09:00,['2006/12/19 09:00'],"['2006/07/26 00:00 [received]', '2006/12/19 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/05/01 09:00 [medline]', '2006/12/19 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0041-1345(06)01274-7 [pii]', '10.1016/j.transproceed.2006.10.045 [doi]']",ppublish,Transplant Proc. 2006 Dec;38(10):3437-40. doi: 10.1016/j.transproceed.2006.10.045.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, we explored functional interactions of the c-Jun protein with several regulators of the G1/S transition in serum-deprived v-myb-transformed chicken monoblasts BM2. We show that the c-Jun protein induces expression of cyclin A, thus up-regulating activity of cyclin A-associated cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (CDK2), and causing massive programmed cell death of starved BM2cJUN cells. Specific inhibition of CDK2 suppresses frequency of apoptosis of BM2cJUN cells.

Recently, it was shown that childhood lymphoblastic leukemia, breast and ovarian cancers express an interferon-related signature, providing support for this notion. We have previously shown that 38% of the sporadic breast cancers contain MMTV-like env gene sequences. To find out if the presence and expression of MMTV-like sequences correlated with an inflammatory phenotype, we have compared the expression profile of two sublines of MCF-7 cells, one containing the MMTV-like sequences (env+), the other one lacking them (env-). RESULTS: The results indicated that there were 47 differentially expressed genes between the two sublines. Among 27 upregulated genes in the env+ cells there were 7 interferon-related genes, 5 TNF-connected genes and 2 TGFbeta-related genes. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that the env+ cells were most likely responding to an infectious agent, and support the hypothesis that a viral infection may play a role in breast cancer pathogenesis.","['Fernandez-Cobo, Mariana', 'Melana, Stella M', 'Holland, James F', 'Pogo, Beatriz G T']","['Fernandez-Cobo M', 'Melana SM', 'Holland JF', 'Pogo BG']","['Department of Medicine, Mount Sinai School of Medicine, New York, USA. mariana.fernandez@mssm.edu']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20061215,England,Infect Agent Cancer,Infectious agents and cancer,101276559,,,,,2006/12/19 09:00,2006/12/19 09:01,['2006/12/19 09:00'],"['2006/10/26 00:00 [received]', '2006/12/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2006/12/19 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/12/19 09:01 [medline]', '2006/12/19 09:00 [entrez]']","['1750-9378-1-7 [pii]', '10.1186/1750-9378-1-7 [doi]']",epublish,Infect Agent Cancer. 2006 Dec 15;1:7. doi: 10.1186/1750-9378-1-7.,,,,,PMC1764410,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we demonstrate that the survival of human T-cell leukemia and lymphoma cell lines is critically dependent on Bcl11b. Suppression of Bcl11b by RNA interference selectively induced apoptosis in transformed T cells whereas normal mature T cells remained unaffected. The apoptosis was effected by simultaneous activation of death receptor-mediated and intrinsic apoptotic pathways, most likely as a result of tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) upregulation and suppression of the Bcl-xL antiapoptotic protein. Our data indicate an antiapoptotic function of Bcl11b. The resistance of normal mature T lymphocytes to Bcl11b suppression-induced apoptosis and restricted expression pattern make it an attractive therapeutic target in T-cell malignancies.","['Grabarczyk, P', 'Przybylski, G K', 'Depke, M', 'Volker, U', 'Bahr, J', 'Assmus, K', 'Broker, B M', 'Walther, R', 'Schmidt, C A']","['Grabarczyk P', 'Przybylski GK', 'Depke M', 'Volker U', 'Bahr J', 'Assmus K', 'Broker BM', 'Walther R', 'Schmidt CA']","['Clinic for Internal Medicine C, University of Greifswald, Greifswald, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20061218,England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (BCL11B protein, human)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand)', '0 (TNFSF10 protein, human)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '0 (bcl-X Protein)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*physiology', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/genetics/*metabolism', 'Lymphoma/genetics/*metabolism', 'RNA Interference', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'RNA, Small Interfering', 'Repressor Proteins/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'T-Lymphocytes/*metabolism/pathology', 'TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand/metabolism', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'bcl-X Protein/metabolism']",,2006/12/19 09:00,2007/07/10 09:00,['2006/12/19 09:00'],"['2006/12/19 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/07/10 09:00 [medline]', '2006/12/19 09:00 [entrez]']","['1210152 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.onc.1210152 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2007 May 31;26(26):3797-810. doi: 10.1038/sj.onc.1210152.

Although ABT-737 triggers extensive cell death in many small-cell lung carcinoma (SCLC) cell lines, some of the SCLC cell lines and the majority of the cancer cell lines derived from other solid tumors were found to be resistant to ABT-737. To better understand the mechanism of resistance to ABT-737, we screened a short interfering RNA library consisting of short interfering RNA against 4000 'druggable' targets in an SCLC-derived cell line, NCI-H196. By comparing the knockdowns with phenotypes, all of the three top 'hits' from the screen were found to result from off-target gene silencing. Interestingly, the three off-target siRNAs were found to knock down an antiapoptotic Bcl-2 family protein Mcl-1 owing to the complementation between their seed regions with the 3' untranslated region (3' UTR) of Mcl-1. Furthermore, reducing the level of Mcl-1 using siRNAs or the small-molecule compounds Bay43-9006 and Seliciclib was sufficient to overcome the resistance to ABT-737 in the resistant SCLC cell line and cancer cell lines derived from other solid tumors. These results provide further evidence that Mcl-1 is the major factor that causes resistance to ABT-737 in cancer cells derived from diverse solid tumors, and the combination of Mcl-1 downregulating agents with ABT-737 could be potent therapeutic regimens for patient with ABT-737-resistant SCLC and many other types of solid tumors.","['Lin, X', 'Morgan-Lappe, S', 'Huang, X', 'Li, L', 'Zakula, D M', 'Vernetti, L A', 'Fesik, S W', 'Shen, Y']","['Lin X', 'Morgan-Lappe S', 'Huang X', 'Li L', 'Zakula DM', 'Vernetti LA', 'Fesik SW', 'Shen Y']","['Cancer Research, Global Pharmaceutical Research and Development, Abbott Laboratories, Abbott Park, IL 60064, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20061218,England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"[""0 (3' Untranslated Regions)"", '0 (ABT-737)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzenesulfonates)', '0 (Biphenyl Compounds)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nitrophenols)', '0 (Phenylurea Compounds)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Purines)', '0 (Pyridines)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (Sulfonamides)', '0 (TNFRSF13B protein, human)', '0 (Transmembrane Activator and CAML Interactor Protein)', '0 (bcl-X Protein)', '0ES1C2KQ94 (Roscovitine)', '25X51I8RD4 (Niacinamide)', '9ZOQ3TZI87 (Sorafenib)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FGFR2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor, Fibroblast Growth Factor, Type 2)']",IM,"[""3' Untranslated Regions/genetics"", 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Base Sequence', 'Benzenesulfonates/pharmacology', 'Biphenyl Compounds/*pharmacology', 'Blotting, Western', 'Carcinoma, Small Cell/drug therapy/genetics/pathology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival/drug effects/genetics/physiology', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/drug effects/genetics', 'Humans', 'Lung Neoplasms/drug therapy/genetics/pathology', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics/metabolism/*physiology', 'Niacinamide/analogs & derivatives', 'Nitrophenols/*pharmacology', 'Phenylurea Compounds', 'Piperazines/pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism/*physiology', 'Purines/pharmacology', 'Pyridines/pharmacology', 'RNA Interference', 'RNA, Small Interfering/*genetics', 'Receptor, Fibroblast Growth Factor, Type 2', 'Roscovitine', 'Sorafenib', 'Sulfonamides/*pharmacology', 'Transmembrane Activator and CAML Interactor Protein/genetics', 'Zinc Fingers/genetics', 'bcl-X Protein/antagonists & inhibitors']",,2006/12/19 09:00,2007/07/13 09:00,['2006/12/19 09:00'],"['2006/12/19 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/07/13 09:00 [medline]', '2006/12/19 09:00 [entrez]']","['1210166 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.onc.1210166 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2007 Jun 7;26(27):3972-9. doi: 10.1038/sj.onc.1210166.

These cells have attracted intense scrutiny because they are proving exceptionally refractory to attempts to kill them, in vitro, using imatinib mesylate, the current first-line therapy for CML, or conventional chemotherapeutic agents, such as cytosine arabinoside. This insensitivity, or resistance, to drug treatment is ominous and has important implications for the clinical management of CML, particularly with regard to relapse following an imatinib-induced remission. In this review, we consider the known properties of this cell population, including recent evidence which suggests that transcription of BCR-ABL occurs at an exceptionally high level in these cells despite them having only a single copy of the oncogene. We also discuss possible alternative, Bcr-Abl-independent, mechanisms for the insensitivity of these cells to agents which promote apoptosis, including the putative role of transporter proteins in causing abnormal drug influx or efflux.","['Barnes, David J', 'Melo, Junia V']","['Barnes DJ', 'Melo JV']","['Department of Haematology, Imperial College London, Hammersmith Hospital, London, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20061215,United States,Cell Cycle,"Cell cycle (Georgetown, Tex.)",101137841,"['0 (5-(6)-carboxyfluorescein diacetate succinimidyl ester)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Fluoresceins)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Succinimides)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)']",IM,"['Benzamides', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Fluoresceins', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*pathology', 'Piperazines/pharmacology', 'Pyrimidines/pharmacology', 'Stem Cells/drug effects/*pathology', 'Succinimides']",55,2006/12/19 09:00,2007/02/23 09:00,['2006/12/19 09:00'],"['2006/12/19 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/02/23 09:00 [medline]', '2006/12/19 09:00 [entrez]']","['3573 [pii]', '10.4161/cc.5.24.3573 [doi]']",ppublish,Cell Cycle. 2006 Dec;5(24):2862-6. doi: 10.4161/cc.5.24.3573.

Expression of BCL2, bax, PKC alpha, ERK2 and pERK2 proteins was measured using laser scanning cytometry. The SV population was enriched for CD34+ stem cells. Protein expression patterns in SV differed considerably from those in controls; culture and reanalysis of protein expression revealed stability, reversion, or new patterns of change. Patterns of pairs or triads of proteins were nonrandomly distributed and appeared at statistically unlikely frequencies, suggesting preferential adoption of certain patterns. The patterns of change were highly predictive of remission attainment, relapse, and survival in univariate and multivariate analysis. We conclude that in vitro SV cells have protein expression patterns distinct from those of the bulk population of leukemic cells and that these patterns are predictive of outcome.

Overexpression of Bcl-2 may inhibit this effect. Thus, functional inactivation of antiapoptotic Bcl-2 proteins may enhance apoptogenic effects of Mdm2 inhibition. We here investigate the potential therapeutic utility of combined targeting of Mdm2 by Nutlin-3a and Bcl-2 by ABT-737, recently developed inhibitors of protein-protein interactions. Nutlin-3a and ABT-737 induced Bax conformational change and mitochondrial apoptosis in AML cells in a strikingly synergistic fashion. Nutlin-3a induced p53-mediated apoptosis predominantly in S and G2/M cells, while cells in G1 were protected through induction of p21. In contrast, ABT-737 induced apoptosis predominantly in G1, the cell cycle phase with the lowest Bcl-2 protein levels and Bcl-2/Bax ratios. In addition, Bcl-2 phosphorylation on Ser70 was absent in G1 but detectable in G2/M, thus lower Bcl-2 levels and absence of Bcl-2 phosphorylation appeared to facilitate ABT-737-induced apoptosis of G1 cells. The complementary effects of Nutlin-3a and ABT-737 in different cell cycle phases could, in part, account for their synergistic activity. Our data suggest that combined targeting of Mdm2 and Bcl-2 proteins could offer considerable therapeutic promise in AML.","['Kojima, Kensuke', 'Konopleva, Marina', 'Samudio, Ismael J', 'Schober, Wendy D', 'Bornmann, William G', 'Andreeff, Michael']","['Kojima K', 'Konopleva M', 'Samudio IJ', 'Schober WD', 'Bornmann WG', 'Andreeff M']","['Section of Molecular Hematology and Therapy, Department of Blood and Marrow Transplantation, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas 77030, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20061201,United States,Cell Cycle,"Cell cycle (Georgetown, Tex.)",101137841,"['0 (ABT-737)', '0 (Annexin A5)', '0 (Biphenyl Compounds)', '0 (Imidazoles)', '0 (Mutant Proteins)', '0 (Nitrophenols)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Sulfonamides)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', '53IA0V845C (nutlin 3)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (MDM2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-mdm2)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Annexin A5/metabolism', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Biphenyl Compounds/*pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'G1 Phase/drug effects', 'G2 Phase/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Imidazoles/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Mitochondria/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Mitosis/drug effects', 'Mutant Proteins/metabolism', 'Nitrophenols/*pharmacology', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Piperazines/*pharmacology', 'Protein Conformation/drug effects', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-mdm2/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'S Phase/drug effects', 'Sulfonamides/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/metabolism', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein/metabolism']",,2006/12/19 09:00,2007/01/26 09:00,['2006/12/19 09:00'],"['2006/12/19 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/01/26 09:00 [medline]', '2006/12/19 09:00 [entrez]']","['3520 [pii]', '10.4161/cc.5.23.3520 [doi]']",ppublish,Cell Cycle. 2006 Dec;5(23):2778-86. doi: 10.4161/cc.5.23.3520.

It is well established that perturbation of these processes plays a key role in hematologic malignancies including lymphomas and chronic and acute lymphocytic leukemias. Altered intracellular signaling pathways have been proposed to mediate many biological properties of T cell large granular lymphocytic leukemia (T-LGL), a disorder characterized by a clonal proliferation of CD8 T cells resulting in immune-mediated cytopenias, most commonly neutropenia. Since T-LGL offers a unique opportunity to study signal transduction in the pathologic clonal cytotoxic T cell (CTL) compared to normal CTL, we have investigated a potential imbalance in T-LGL pro-survival signaling to define the mechanisms underlying the semi-autonomous proliferation leading to leukemia. Increased activity of the PI3K-AKT signaling axis in T-LGL cells appears to operate in conjunction with or parallel to increased STAT3 activation in these cells to inhibit the apoptotic program. Thus, the ability to define pathophysiology at the molecular level opens new avenues for targeted therapeutics.","['Schade, Andrew E', 'Wlodarski, Marcin W', 'Maciejewski, Jaroslaw P']","['Schade AE', 'Wlodarski MW', 'Maciejewski JP']","['Section of Experimental Hematology and Hematopoiesis, Taussig Cancer Center, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, Ohio 44195, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20061115,United States,Cell Cycle,"Cell cycle (Georgetown, Tex.)",101137841,"['0 (STAT Transcription Factors)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinases)']",IM,"['CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Humans', 'Janus Kinases/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/enzymology/etiology/*metabolism', 'Models, Biological', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/*metabolism', 'STAT Transcription Factors/*metabolism', '*Signal Transduction']",38,2006/12/19 09:00,2007/02/13 09:00,['2006/12/19 09:00'],"['2006/12/19 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/02/13 09:00 [medline]', '2006/12/19 09:00 [entrez]']","['3449 [pii]', '10.4161/cc.5.22.3449 [doi]']",ppublish,Cell Cycle. 2006 Nov;5(22):2571-4. doi: 10.4161/cc.5.22.3449.

PML nuclear isoforms (nPML) are the essential components of subnuclear structures referred to as PML nuclear bodies (PML-NB). In response to cellular insults such as DNA damage and oncogenic activation, nPML modulates p53 activity through CBP-mediated acetylation and activates its pro-apoptotic and growth suppressive functions. Two missense mutations resulting in truncated PML cytoplasmic proteins (Mut PML) have been identified in aggressive APL cases. Here we report that cytoplasmic PML is able to induce the relocation of nPML to the cytoplasm, thus reducing the number of PML-NBs.

Fusions of Ets genes with other targets have been described in Ewing's sarcoma, chronic myelomonocytic leukemia and more recently prostate carcinoma. Ets expression in breast carcinoma has not been comprehensively studied, and is the focus of this study. METHODS: RT-Q-PCR was used to determine the expression of Ets genes in a panel of ten common breast cancer cell lines, two immortalized normal breast epithelial cell lines, and one primary culture of human mammary epithelial cells. Ets with altered expression in cancer cell lines were verified in primary breast tumors. RESULTS: Transcripts of 21 of the 27 Ets genes were detected in either normal or cancer cells. Of the 21 detectable genes, 14 were expressed at a similar level in both normal and breast cancer cell lines. Four genes, Ehf, Elf3, Elf5 and Pdef, were expressed at higher levels in breast cancer cells than normal epithelials. Surprisingly, the expression of Elk3, Etsl and Flil was repressed in breast cancer cells. The protein status of Ehf, Elf3, Pdef, Elk3, Etsl and Flil, strongly correlated with the transcript data, suggesting that Ets expression is regulated primarily at the transcriptional level. Similarly, Elf3, Pdef and Tel2 were overexpressed, while Elk3, Etsl and Flil were under-expressed in primary breast tumor specimens in comparison with normal mammary tissues. CONCLUSIONS: Our study identified a subset of Ets genes with altered expression in breast carcinoma, implicating their roles in mammary tumorigenesis. While the Ets over-expression pattern is useful to uncover recurrent genetic alterations involving Ets genes, the repressed expression of several Ets genes suggests that some Ets proteins may play suppressor roles during breast cancer progression. Our results warrant detailed studies of individual Ets activity during mammary gland neoplasia.","['He, Jin', 'Pan, Yong', 'Hu, Jianhua', 'Albarracin, Constance', 'Wu, Yun', 'Dai, Jia Le']","['He J', 'Pan Y', 'Hu J', 'Albarracin C', 'Wu Y', 'Dai JL']","['Department of Molecular Pathology, Unit 951, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, 25CR4.2026, 7435 Fannin St, Houston, Texas 77054, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Cancer Biol Ther,Cancer biology & therapy,101137842,"['0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-ets)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)']",IM,"['Breast Neoplasms/*genetics', 'Carcinoma/*genetics', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Female', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Humans', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-ets/*genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis']",,2006/12/19 09:00,2007/08/10 09:00,['2006/12/19 09:00'],"['2006/12/19 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/08/10 09:00 [medline]', '2006/12/19 09:00 [entrez]']","['3551 [pii]', '10.4161/cbt.6.1.3551 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Biol Ther. 2007 Jan;6(1):76-82. doi: 10.4161/cbt.6.1.3551.,,['Cancer Biol Ther. 2007 Jan;6(1):83-4.

In the future, SP antagonists may be used as anti-neoplastic drugs, for example by direct or indirect blocking of tumour cell proliferation through inhibition of growth factor production and interleukin-1b synthesis.","['Nowicki, Michal', 'Ostalska-Nowicka, Danuta', 'Kondraciuk, Beata', 'Miskowiak, Bogdan']","['Nowicki M', 'Ostalska-Nowicka D', 'Kondraciuk B', 'Miskowiak B']","['Department of Histology and Embryology, Poznan University of Medical Sciences, Poland. mnowicki@amp.edu.pl']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20061215,England,J Clin Pathol,Journal of clinical pathology,0376601,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Tachykinins)', '33507-63-0 (Substance P)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/*metabolism', 'Hematopoiesis/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/metabolism', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Neoplasm Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/*physiology', 'Neoplasms/metabolism', 'Substance P/antagonists & inhibitors/*physiology', 'Tachykinins/physiology']",109,2006/12/19 09:00,2007/08/01 09:00,['2006/12/19 09:00'],"['2006/12/19 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/08/01 09:00 [medline]', '2006/12/19 09:00 [entrez]']","['jcp.2006.041475 [pii]', '10.1136/jcp.2006.041475 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Pathol. 2007 Jul;60(7):749-55. doi: 10.1136/jcp.2006.041475.

Using peptide-based CXCR4 inhibitors derived from the chemokine viral macrophage inflammatory protein II, we tested the hypothesis that the inhibition of CXCR4 increases sensitivity to chemotherapy by interfering with stromal/leukemia cell interactions. First, leukemic cells expressing varying amounts of surface CXCR4 were examined for their chemotactic response to SDF-1alpha or stromal cells, alone or in the presence of different CXCR4 inhibitors. Results showed that the polypeptide RCP168 had the strongest antagonistic effect on the SDF-1alpha- or stromal cell-induced chemotaxis of leukemic cells. Furthermore, RCP168 blocked the binding of anti-CXCR4 monoclonal antibody 12G5 to surface CXCR4 in a concentration-dependent manner and inhibited SDF-1alpha-induced AKT and extracellular signal-regulated kinase phosphorylation. Finally, RCP168 significantly enhanced chemotherapy-induced apoptosis in stroma-cocultured Jurkat, primary chronic lymphocytic leukemia, and in a subset of acute myelogenous leukemia cells harboring Flt3 mutation. Equivalent results were obtained with the small-molecule CXCR4 inhibitor AMD3465. Our data therefore suggest that the SDF-1alpha/CXCR4 interaction contributes to the resistance of leukemia cells to chemotherapy-induced apoptosis. Disruption of these interactions by the peptide CXCR4 inhibitor RCP168 represents a novel strategy for targeting leukemic cells within the bone marrow microenvironment.","['Zeng, Zhihong', 'Samudio, Ismael J', 'Munsell, Mark', 'An, Jing', 'Huang, Ziwei', 'Estey, Elihu', 'Andreeff, Michael', 'Konopleva, Marina']","['Zeng Z', 'Samudio IJ', 'Munsell M', 'An J', 'Huang Z', 'Estey E', 'Andreeff M', 'Konopleva M']","['Department of Blood and Marrow Transplantation, Section of Molecular Hematology and Therapy, Unit 448, 1515 Holcombe Boulevard, The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Mol Cancer Ther,Molecular cancer therapeutics,101132535,"['0 (CXCL12 protein, human)', '0 (Chemokine CXCL12)', '0 (Chemokines, CXC)', '0 (N-(1,4,8,11-', 'tetraazacyclotetradecanyl-1,4-phenylenebis(methylene))-2-(aminomethyl)- pyridine)', '0 (Peptides)', '0 (Pyridines)', '0 (Receptors, CXCR4)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases)']",IM,"['Chemokine CXCL12', 'Chemokines, CXC/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Chemotaxis/drug effects', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'MAP Kinase Signaling System', 'Peptides/*pharmacology', 'Phosphorylation', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/antagonists & inhibitors/biosynthesis/metabolism', 'Pyridines/*pharmacology', 'Receptors, CXCR4/*antagonists & inhibitors/biosynthesis', 'Stromal Cells/pathology', 'U937 Cells']",,2006/12/19 09:00,2007/06/08 09:00,['2006/12/19 09:00'],"['2006/12/19 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/06/08 09:00 [medline]', '2006/12/19 09:00 [entrez]']","['5/12/3113 [pii]', '10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-06-0228 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Cancer Ther. 2006 Dec;5(12):3113-21. doi: 10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-06-0228.,,,,,,,"['CA16672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA49639/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA55164/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Compounds inhibited colony formation of all cell lines in a dose-dependent fashion. Inhibitory concentrations for 50% of the colony formation/survival (IC50) for BIBF1000 were <100 nmol/L for 3 of 11, <or=500 nmol/L for 6 of 11, and <1,000 nmol/L for 10 of 11 leukemic cell lines, with one cell line being resistant in the dose range <1,000 nmol/L.

In the present studies, we determined that treatment with the hydroxamate histone deacetylase inhibitor LBH589 or LAQ824 depleted the protein levels of EZH2, SUZ12, and EED in the cultured (K562, U937, and HL-60) and primary human acute leukemia cells. This was associated with decreased levels of trimethylated and dimethylated H3K27, with concomitant depletion of the homeobox domain containing HOXA9 and of MEIS1 transcription factors. Knockdown of EZH2 by EZH2 small interfering RNA also depleted SUZ12 and EED, inhibited histone methyltransferase activity, and reduced trimethylated and dimethylated H3K27 levels, with a concomitant loss of clonogenic survival of the cultured acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) cells. EZH2 small interfering RNA sensitized the AML cells to LBH589-mediated depletion of EZH2, SUZ12, and EED; loss of clonogenic survival; and LBH589-induced differentiation of the AML cells.

CONCLUSION: G-CSF-mobilized unrelated donor PBSCs engraft more rapidly in the recipients as compared with conventional BM grafts. The T cell reconstitution, the incidence of infection, the incidence and severity of aGVHD and cGVHD, and the 2-year DFS rates between the two groups all have no significant differences.","['Fan, Zhi-ping', 'Yang, Kai', 'Liu, Qi-fa', 'Sun, Jing', 'Xu, Dan', 'Zhang, Yu', 'Wei, Yong-qiang', 'Ye, Chang-xiong', 'Jiang, Qian-li', 'Meng, Fan-yi']","['Fan ZP', 'Yang K', 'Liu QF', 'Sun J', 'Xu D', 'Zhang Y', 'Wei YQ', 'Ye CX', 'Jiang QL', 'Meng FY']","['Department of Hematology, Nanfang Hospital, Southern Medical University, Guangzhou 510515, China.']",['chi'],"['Comparative Study', 'English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",,China,Zhonghua Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi,Zhonghua xue ye xue za zhi = Zhonghua xueyexue zazhi,8212398,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/*methods', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*surgery', 'Male', 'Peripheral Blood Stem Cell Transplantation/*methods', '*Tissue Donors', 'Transplantation Conditioning', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Treatment Outcome']",,2006/12/19 09:00,2007/09/01 09:00,['2006/12/19 09:00'],"['2006/12/19 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/09/01 09:00 [medline]', '2006/12/19 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Zhonghua Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi. 2006 Aug;27(8):525-8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Quantification of bcr-abl mRNA was performed on 316 bone marrow samples from 112 patients with CML after HSCT by Q-PCR using the TaqMan probe system. The bcr-abl mRNA level was normalized by control gene abl. Cytogenetic response was evaluated with fluorescent in-situ hybridization (FISH). RESULTS: The reproducible sensitivity of Q-PCR was 5 copies. The coefficients C(T) of interassay and intraassay variation for abl and bcr-abl were all below 2.0%. 289 bone marrow samples were collected from 101 CML patients who achieved a sustained complete cytogenetic response (CCyR) one month post allo-HSCT in a period of 6 - 60 months (median 12 months) at different intervals. In general, the median bcr-abl levels gradually decreased with the prolongation of time after HSCT: the median bcr-abl levels were 0.035% (0 - 0.406%) at 1 month post allo-HSCT (+ 1 month), 0.006% (0 - 0.683%) at +3 month, 0% (0 - 0.225%) at +6 month and remained 0% till +24 months. The highest level in CCyR patients detected at + 6 month was 0.068%. The bcr-abl mRNA level was decreased by 3 log in sustained CCyR patients at + 1 month compared with the newly diagnosed CML-CP patients (33.0%, data unpublished). On the contrary, Q-PCR results ranged from 0.12% to 13.45% in 8 cytogenetic non-responders or relapsed patients post allo-HSCT. Among them, 5 patients' samples were collected 1 - 2 months before cytogenetic relapse, the results were ranged from 0.09% to 3.42%. If 0.09% was assumed 0.09% as a threshold, 9 sustained CCyR patients (8.9%) were tested once higher than that within 6 month after HSCT but decreased to 0% eventually. 2 blast crisis patients achieved CCyR within 1.6 and 3 months after HSCT, but hematological relapse occurred after 1 and 1.5 months, and their bcr-abl mRNA levels increased dramatically from 0% and 0.14% to 46.9% and 75.9% respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Q- PCR is a sensitive, precise and reliable technique, and can be used to monitor CML patients post allo-HSCT regularly. Patients in blast phase of CML should be monitored more frequently.","['Qin, Ya-zhen', 'Li, Jin-lan', 'Zhu, Hong-hu', 'Ruan, Guo-rui', 'Li, Ling-di', 'Zhang, Yan', 'Xu, Lan-ping', 'Liu, Dai-hong', 'Liu, Yan-rong', 'Huang, Xiao-jun', 'Chen, Shan-shan', 'Lu, Dao-pei']","['Qin YZ', 'Li JL', 'Zhu HH', 'Ruan GR', 'Li LD', 'Zhang Y', 'Xu LP', 'Liu DH', 'Liu YR', 'Huang XJ', 'Chen SS', 'Lu DP']","[""Institute of Hematology, People's Hospital of Peking University, Beijing 100044, China.""]",['chi'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",,China,Zhonghua Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi,Zhonghua xue ye xue za zhi = Zhonghua xueyexue zazhi,8212398,"['0 (RNA, Messenger)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Bone Marrow Cells/metabolism', 'Child', 'Female', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*biosynthesis/genetics', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*metabolism/surgery', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction/methods']",,2006/12/19 09:00,2007/09/01 09:00,['2006/12/19 09:00'],"['2006/12/19 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/09/01 09:00 [medline]', '2006/12/19 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Zhonghua Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi. 2006 Aug;27(8):511-4.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PROCEDURE: In this retrospective multi-institutional study we examine the clinical, hematological, and molecular features of 12 children aged 5-16 years with thrombocytosis and a suspected diagnosis of ET. RESULTS: Median follow-up was 59 months (range 10-72). Seven patients presented with clinical symptoms potentially related to thrombocytosis. The remaining five patients were diagnosed incidentally. Median platelet count at diagnosis was 1,325 x 10(9)/L (range 600-3,050). In 11 out of 12 cases bone marrow morphology was consistent with ET, the remaining patient had chronic idiopathic myelofibrosis. Cytogenetic analyses were normal in all studied cases and only one out of nine analyzed cases harbored a JAK(V617F) allele. Within 6 months after initial presentation one patient who was initially asymptomatic developed thrombosis and another patient had mild bleeding. Eight patients were treated with acetylsalicylic acid, one patient received hydroxyurea, and two patients received anagrelide. At last follow-up, all patients were alive and none had developed leukemia. Five patients experienced hematological remission. Two children had not received any therapy. During the course of their disease, nine patients developed symptoms possibly attributable to an elevated platelet count. CONCLUSIONS: In JAK2 mutation negative cases, long-term follow-up is helpful to distinguish between primary and secondary thrombocytosis. Secondary cases are not associated with organomegaly but may present with unspecific symptoms. Indications for treatment in children remain unclear.","['El-Moneim, Abeer Abd', 'Kratz, Christian P', 'Boll, Silke', 'Rister, Manfred', 'Pahl, Heike L', 'Niemeyer, Charlotte M']","['El-Moneim AA', 'Kratz CP', 'Boll S', 'Rister M', 'Pahl HL', 'Niemeyer CM']","['Division of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Department of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, University of Freiburg, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,"['EC 2.7.10.2 (JAK2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 2)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Age Distribution', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Chronic Disease', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Janus Kinase 2/genetics/metabolism', 'Male', 'Primary Myelofibrosis/*diagnosis/therapy', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Thrombocythemia, Essential/*diagnosis/therapy', 'Time Factors']",,2006/12/16 09:00,2007/07/10 09:00,['2006/12/16 09:00'],"['2006/12/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/07/10 09:00 [medline]', '2006/12/16 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/pbc.21128 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2007 Jul;49(1):52-5. doi: 10.1002/pbc.21128.,,,,,,,['P01 CA108671/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,

Previously, we identified and characterized transcription factor promyelocytic leukemia zinc finger protein (PLZF), composed of an N-terminal BTB/POZ and C-terminal zinc finger motifs, as an upstream factor of CBFA1 (Runx2/core-binding factor 1). PLZF was induced in an osteoblastic differentiation medium, but was not induced by BMP2. Here, we report the identification of transcription factor fanconi anemia zinc finger protein (FAZF), which is closely related to PLZF. FAZF was induced by BMP2 in human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs). In addition to the full-length FAZF, we also identified alternatively spliced mRNAs in which the C-terminal zinc finger motifs were deleted (designated BTB/POZ-only FAZF). Both the full-length and BTB/POZ-only FAZF mRNAs were equally expressed in BMP2-treated hMSCs. The full-length FAZF was exclusively detected in the nucleus, whereas the BTB/POZ-only FAZF protein was localized in the cytoplasm of the transfected cells. The full-length FAZF, but not the BTB/POZ-only FAZF, increased the expression of osteoblastic differentiation markers, including CBFA1, collagen 1A1, osteocalcin, and alkaline phosphatase in C2C12 cells. In conclusion, both FAZF and PLZF differentially participate in the regulation of osteoblastic differentiation via the BMP2 and CBFA1 signaling pathways, respectively.","['Ikeda, Ryuji', 'Yoshida, Kenichi', 'Inoue, Ituro']","['Ikeda R', 'Yoshida K', 'Inoue I']","['Department of Clinical Pharmacy and pharmacology, Graduate School of Medical and Dental Sciences, Kagoshima University, 8-35-1 Sakuragaoka, Kagoshima 890-8520, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,J Cell Biochem,Journal of cellular biochemistry,8205768,"['0 (BMP2 protein, human)', '0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (Bone Morphogenetic Protein 2)', '0 (Bone Morphogenetic Proteins)', '0 (Codon, Terminator)', '0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Transforming Growth Factor beta)', '0 (ZBTB32 protein, human)', 'EC 3.1.3.1 (Alkaline Phosphatase)']",IM,"['Alkaline Phosphatase/analysis', 'Alternative Splicing', 'Amino Acid Motifs', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Base Sequence', 'Biomarkers/metabolism', 'Bone Morphogenetic Protein 2', 'Bone Morphogenetic Proteins/*pharmacology', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Nucleus/metabolism', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Codon, Terminator', 'Conserved Sequence', 'DNA, Complementary', 'Exons', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique, Direct', 'Histocytochemistry', 'Humans', 'Mesenchymal Stem Cells/cytology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Open Reading Frames', 'Osteoblasts/*cytology/metabolism/physiology', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'Repressor Proteins/biosynthesis/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid', 'Transcription Factors/biosynthesis/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Transfection', 'Transforming Growth Factor beta/*pharmacology']",,2006/12/16 09:00,2007/06/07 09:00,['2006/12/16 09:00'],"['2006/12/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/06/07 09:00 [medline]', '2006/12/16 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/jcb.21165 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cell Biochem. 2007 May 1;101(1):147-54. doi: 10.1002/jcb.21165.,,,,,,"['(c) 2006 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

The active drug is the intracellular metabolite cytosine-arabinoside-5'-triphosphate (ara-CTP). The purpose of the present study was to investigate the relation between sensitivity and pharmacokinetic parameters Cmax, t1/2 and AUC of ara-CTP. The obtained results were compared to previous studies. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Cmax, t1/2 and AUC of ara-CTP were assessed in leukemic cells of 17 pediatric patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and in 6 lymphoblastic cell lines and compared with normal lymphocytes of 9 healthy donors by high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC). The sensitivity of the cells against ara-C was determined by the MTT assay. RESULTS: The intracellular accumulation of ara-CTP was significantly lower in normal lymphocytes (Cmax 47.7-60.9 pmol/10(6) cells) compared to leukemic cell lines (Cmax 11-1128 pmol/10(6) cells) and leukemic cells of our patients (Cmax 85.9-631 pmol/10(6) cells). Similar results were found for the AUC. There was no significant difference between initial and relapsed leukemias in our small cohort. A correlation between sensitivity in terms of IC50 values and the intracellular ara-CTP accumulation was observed in cell lines, but not in leukemic cells and normal lymphocytes from healthy donors. CONCLUSIONS: Pharmacokinetic parameters varied tremendously in leukemic cells in contrast to normal lymphocytes without a difference in sensitivity. It is worthwhile to compare literature data to assess an optimal dosage of ara-C in pediatric patients.","['Koehl, U', 'Hollatz, G', 'Rohrbach, E', 'Visschedyk, K', 'Cinatl, J', 'Kornhuber, B', 'Kreuter, J', 'Mutschler, E', 'Schwabe, D']","['Koehl U', 'Hollatz G', 'Rohrbach E', 'Visschedyk K', 'Cinatl J', 'Kornhuber B', 'Kreuter J', 'Mutschler E', 'Schwabe D']","['Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Laboratory for Stem Cell Transplantation and Immunotherapy, Johann Wolfgang Goethe-University, Theodor Stern Kai 7, 60596 Frankfurt a.

SOURCES: Medical literature published during the last 20 years identified using PubMed and MEDLINE and from specialized medical books, with emphasis on infective dermatitis associated with HTLV-I (IDH), on the juvenile form of HTLV-associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis (HAM/TSP), on adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATL) and on HTLV-I-associated uveitis. Keywords used to search databases were: HTLV-I-associated infective dermatitis, HTLV-I-associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis, adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma, HTLV-I-associated uveitis. SUMMARY OF THE FINDINGS: IDH is a chronic, relapsing and infected dermatitis of childhood which always involves the scalp and which may progress to HAM/TSP and ATL. HAM/TSP is a chronic and incapacitating myelopathy of adults. There are 17 well-documented cases of HAM/TSP in children and adolescents in the literature, 12 of whom are patients with IDH. In contrast with the adult form of the disease, the juvenile form is rapid and progressive. ATL is a type of T-cell leukemia/lymphoma that affects adults and is generally fatal. Eleven of the 24 published reports of ATL in children and adolescents were diagnosed in Brazil. CONCLUSIONS: These diseases are likely to be more common in childhood and adolescence than the literature would suggest. It is advisable that serological testing be performed for HTLV-I in children and adolescents suffering from chronic and relapsing eczema, with signs and symptoms of myelopathy or with a diagnosis of T-cell leukemia/lymphoma. It is important that pediatricians know how to recognize the pediatric manifestations of this infection in order to correctly diagnose them and offer their patients appropriate guidance and treatment.","['Bittencourt, Achilea Lisboa', 'Primo, Janeusa', 'Oliveira, Maria Fatima Paim de']","['Bittencourt AL', 'Primo J', 'Oliveira MF']","['Faculdade de Medicina, Universidade Federal da Bahia (UFBA), Salvador, BA, Brazil. achilea@uol.com.br']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,Brazil,J Pediatr (Rio J),Jornal de pediatria,2985188R,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Blotting, Western', 'Breast Feeding', 'Child', 'Dermatitis, Atopic/diagnosis', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Eczema/virology', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Female', 'HTLV-I Infections/*complications/diagnosis/transmission', 'Humans', 'Infectious Disease Transmission, Vertical', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/diagnosis/virology', 'Male', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Vision Disorders/virology']",101,2006/12/16 09:00,2007/09/07 09:00,['2006/12/16 09:00'],"['2006/12/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/09/07 09:00 [medline]', '2006/12/16 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.2223/JPED.1573 [doi]'],ppublish,J Pediatr (Rio J). 2006 Nov-Dec;82(6):411-20. doi: 10.2223/JPED.1573.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Report of the BIOMED-2 Concerted Action BHM4-CT98-3936.,207-14,"Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assessment of clonal immunoglobulin (Ig) and T-cell receptor (TCR) gene rearrangements is an important diagnostic tool in mature B-cell neoplasms. However, lack of standardized PCR protocols resulting in a high level of false negativity has hampered comparability of data in previous clonality studies. In order to address these problems, 22 European laboratories investigated the Ig/TCR rearrangement patterns as well as t(14;18) and t(11;14) translocations of 369 B-cell malignancies belonging to five WHO-defined entities using the standardized BIOMED-2 multiplex PCR tubes accompanied by international pathology panel review. B-cell clonality was detected by combined use of the IGH and IGK multiplex PCR assays in all 260 definitive cases of B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (n=56), mantle cell lymphoma (n=54), marginal zone lymphoma (n=41) and follicular lymphoma (n=109).

However, lack of standardized primers and PCR protocols has hampered comparability of data in previous clonality studies. To obtain reference values for Ig/TCR rearrangement patterns, 19 European laboratories investigated 188 T-cell malignancies belonging to five World Health Organization-defined entities. The TCR/Ig spectrum of each sample was analyzed in duplicate in two different laboratories using the standardized BIOMED-2 PCR multiplex tubes accompanied by international pathology panel review. TCR clonality was detected in 99% (143/145) of all definite cases of T-cell prolymphocytic leukemia, T-cell large granular lymphocytic leukemia, peripheral T-cell lymphoma (unspecified) and angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma (AILT), whereas nine of 43 anaplastic large cell lymphomas did not show clonal TCR rearrangements. Combined use of TCRB and TCRG genes revealed two or more clonal signals in 95% of all TCR clonal cases. Ig clonality was mostly restricted to AILT. Our study indicates that the BIOMED-2 multiplex PCR tubes provide a powerful strategy for clonality assessment in T-cell malignancies assisting the firm diagnosis of T-cell neoplasms.

A report of the BIOMED-2 Concerted Action BMH4-CT98-3936.,222-9,"Lymphoproliferations are generally diagnosed via histomorphology and immunohistochemistry. Although mostly conclusive, occasionally the differential diagnosis between reactive lesions and malignant lymphomas is difficult. In such cases molecular clonality studies of immunoglobulin (Ig)/T-cell receptor (TCR) rearrangements can be useful. Here we address the issue of clonality assessment in 106 histologically defined reactive lesions, using the standardized BIOMED-2 Ig/TCR multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) heteroduplex and GeneScan assays. Samples were reviewed nationally, except 10% random cases and cases with clonal results selected for additional international panel review. In total 75% (79/106) only showed polyclonal Ig/TCR targets (type I), whereas another 15% (16/106) represent probably polyclonal cases, with weak Ig/TCR (oligo)clonality in an otherwise polyclonal background (type II). Interestingly, in 10% (11/106) clear monoclonal Ig/TCR products were observed (types III/IV), which prompted further pathological review. Clonal cases included two missed lymphomas in national review and nine cases that could be explained as diagnostically difficult cases or probable lymphomas upon additional review. Our data show that the BIOMED-2 Ig/TCR multiplex PCR assays are very helpful in confirming the polyclonal character in the vast majority of reactive lesions. However, clonality detection in a minority should lead to detailed pathological review, including close interaction between pathologist and molecular biologist.","['Langerak, A W', 'Molina, T J', 'Lavender, F L', 'Pearson, D', 'Flohr, T', 'Sambade, C', 'Schuuring, E', 'Al Saati, T', 'van Dongen, J J M', 'van Krieken, J H J M']","['Langerak AW', 'Molina TJ', 'Lavender FL', 'Pearson D', 'Flohr T', 'Sambade C', 'Schuuring E', 'Al Saati T', 'van Dongen JJ', 'van Krieken JH']","['Department of Immunology, Erasmus MC, University Medical Center, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20061214,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Immunoglobulins)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)']",IM,"['Biopsy', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 11', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 14', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 18', 'Gene Rearrangement', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulins/genetics', 'Lymphoproliferative Disorders/diagnosis/*genetics/immunology/pathology', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction/*methods', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/genetics', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Translocation, Genetic']",,2006/12/16 09:00,2007/09/26 09:00,['2006/12/16 09:00'],"['2006/12/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/09/26 09:00 [medline]', '2006/12/16 09:00 [entrez]']","['2404482 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.leu.2404482 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2007 Feb;21(2):222-9. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2404482.

We evaluated the utility of 30 well-defined human T-cell lines for quality performance testing of the BIOMED-2 PCR primers and protocols. The PCR analyses of the TCR loci were backed up by Southern blot analysis. The clonal TCRB, TCRG and TCRD gene rearrangements were analyzed for gene segment usage and for the size and composition of their junctional regions. In 29 out of 30 cell lines, unique clonal TCR gene rearrangements could be easily detected.

According to the classic model of hematopoiesis, the differentiation paths leading to the myeloid and lymphoid lineages segregate early. A candidate 'common lymphoid progenitor' (CLP) has been isolated from CD34(+)CD38(-) human cord blood cells based on CD7 expression. Here, we confirm the B- and NK-differentiation potential of CD34(+)CD38(-)CD7(+) cells and show in addition that this population has strong capacity to differentiate into T cells. As CD34(+)CD38(-)CD7(+) cells are virtually devoid of myeloid differentiation potential, these cells represent true CLPs. To unravel the molecular mechanisms underlying lymphoid commitment, we performed genome-wide gene expression profiling on sorted CD34(+)CD38(-)CD7(+) and CD34(+)CD38(-)CD7(-) cells. Interestingly, lymphoid-affiliated genes were mainly upregulated in the CD7(+) population, while myeloid-specific genes were downregulated. This supports the hypothesis that lineage commitment is accompanied by the shutdown of inappropriate gene expression and the upregulation of lineage-specific genes. In addition, we identified several highly expressed genes that have not been described in hematopoiesis before.","['Hoebeke, I', 'De Smedt, M', 'Stolz, F', 'Pike-Overzet, K', 'Staal, F J T', 'Plum, J', 'Leclercq, G']","['Hoebeke I', 'De Smedt M', 'Stolz F', 'Pike-Overzet K', 'Staal FJ', 'Plum J', 'Leclercq G']","['Department of Clinical Chemistry, Microbiology and Immunology, Ghent University Hospital, Ghent, Belgium.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20061214,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Antigens, CD7)', 'EC 3.2.2.6 (ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1)']",IM,"['ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1/*analysis', 'Antigens, CD/analysis', 'Antigens, CD34/*analysis', 'Antigens, CD7/*analysis', 'B-Lymphocytes/cytology/*immunology', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Fetal Blood/cytology/immunology', 'Hematopoiesis', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology/immunology', 'Humans', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Killer Cells, Natural/cytology/*immunology', 'Models, Biological', 'T-Lymphocytes/cytology/*immunology']",,2006/12/16 09:00,2007/09/26 09:00,['2006/12/16 09:00'],"['2006/12/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/09/26 09:00 [medline]', '2006/12/16 09:00 [entrez]']","['2404488 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.leu.2404488 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2007 Feb;21(2):311-9. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2404488.

We have previously shown that their immunosuppressive activity is mainly exerted at the level of T-cell proliferation. Here, we show that MSC exhibit a similar antiproliferative activity on tumor cells of hematopoietic and non hematopoietic origin. In vitro, MSC produced the transient arrest of tumor cells in the G(1) phase of cell cycle; this was accompanied by a reduction in the apoptotic rate even when survival factors were limiting. However, when tumor cells were injected into non-obese diabetic-severe combined immunodeficient mice in conjunction with MSC, their growth was much faster as compared to the group receiving only tumor cells. To explain the discrepancy between the in vitro and in vivo behavior, we suggest that MSC have the ability to form a cancer stem cell niche in which tumor cells can preserve the potential to proliferate and sustain the malignant process. We conclude that the clinical use of MSC in conditions in which a malignant disease is involved should be handled with extreme caution.","['Ramasamy, R', 'Lam, E W-F', 'Soeiro, I', 'Tisato, V', 'Bonnet, D', 'Dazzi, F']","['Ramasamy R', 'Lam EW', 'Soeiro I', 'Tisato V', 'Bonnet D', 'Dazzi F']","['Stem Cell Biology Section, Kennedy Institute of Rheumatology and Division of Investigative Sciences, Imperial College Faculty of Medicine, London, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20061214,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,,IM,"['Adult', 'Animals', 'Apoptosis/*physiology', 'Autopsy', 'Cell Division/*physiology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival', 'G1 Phase', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Jurkat Cells', 'K562 Cells', 'Liver/pathology', 'Lymph Nodes/pathology', 'Mesenchymal Stem Cells/*cytology/*physiology', 'Mice', 'Mice, SCID', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms/*pathology', 'Spleen/pathology', 'Transplantation, Heterologous']",,2006/12/16 09:00,2007/09/26 09:00,['2006/12/16 09:00'],"['2006/12/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/09/26 09:00 [medline]', '2006/12/16 09:00 [entrez]']","['2404489 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.leu.2404489 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2007 Feb;21(2):304-10. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2404489.

Patients' sera were able to induce transcription and secretion of FasL in CD8(+) T cells, followed by apoptosis in vitro; this apoptosis was inhibited by anti-HLA-I-specific monoclonal antibodies, suggesting that sHLA-I is responsible for cell death. These findings closely relate to the in vivo upregulation of FasL transcription observed in peripheral blood (PB) lymphocytes from AML patients; in the same cells, mRNA for the antiapoptotic proteins Bcl-2 and Bcl-x(L) was downregulated. Interestingly, caspase-8 and caspase-3, both downstream mediators of death receptor-induced apoptosis, were activated in CD8(+) cells of AML patients; one-third of these cells were already apoptotic in vivo, at variance with lymphocytes of HD. These data strongly suggest that in AML, increased levels of sHLA-I molecules may contribute to the elimination of potentially anti-tumor effector cells through a FasL/Fas interaction.","['Contini, P', 'Zocchi, M R', 'Pierri, I', 'Albarello, A', 'Poggi, A']","['Contini P', 'Zocchi MR', 'Pierri I', 'Albarello A', 'Poggi A']","['Laboratory of Immunology, University of Genoa, Genoa, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20061214,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Fas Ligand Protein)', '0 (Histocompatibility Antigens Class I)', '0 (Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors)', '614OI1Z5WI (Valproic Acid)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/therapeutic use', 'Fas Ligand Protein/*immunology', 'Female', 'Histocompatibility Antigens Class I/*immunology', 'Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/classification/drug therapy/genetics/*immunology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Valproic Acid/therapeutic use']",,2006/12/16 09:00,2007/09/26 09:00,['2006/12/16 09:00'],"['2006/12/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/09/26 09:00 [medline]', '2006/12/16 09:00 [entrez]']","['2404494 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.leu.2404494 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2007 Feb;21(2):253-60. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2404494.

Knockdown of moesin by RNA interference resulted in enhanced infection, suggesting that even the endogenous basal levels of moesin in rat fibroblasts are sufficient to limit virus infection. Moesin acts as a crosslinker between plasma membrane and actin filaments, as well as a signal transducer in responses involving cytoskeletal remodeling. Moesin overexpression was found to downregulate the formation of stable microtubules, whereas knockdown of moesin increased stable microtubule formation. A virus-resistant mutant cell line also displayed decreased stable microtubule levels, and virus-sensitive revertants recovered from the mutant line showed restoration of the stable microtubules, suggesting that these cytoskeletal networks play an important role in early post-entry events in the retroviral lifecycle. Together, these results suggest that moesin negatively regulates stable microtubule networks and is a natural determinant of cellular sensitivity to retroviral infection.","['Naghavi, Mojgan H', 'Valente, Susana', 'Hatziioannou, Theodora', 'de Los Santos, Kenia', 'Wen, Ying', 'Mott, Christina', 'Gundersen, Gregg G', 'Goff, Stephen P']","['Naghavi MH', 'Valente S', 'Hatziioannou T', 'de Los Santos K', 'Wen Y', 'Mott C', 'Gundersen GG', 'Goff SP']","['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biophysics, Howard Hughes Medical Institute, College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, NY 10032, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20061214,England,EMBO J,The EMBO journal,8208664,"['0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (Microfilament Proteins)', '11056-06-7 (Bleomycin)', '144131-77-1 (moesin)', '181494-14-4 (Zeocin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Bleomycin/chemistry', 'Cell Line/*virology', 'DNA, Viral/metabolism', '*Gene Expression Regulation', 'Gene Library', 'HIV-1/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Microfilament Proteins/metabolism/*physiology', 'Microscopy, Fluorescence', 'Microtubules/*metabolism', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'RNA Interference', 'Rats', 'Retroviridae/*metabolism']",,2006/12/16 09:00,2007/03/10 09:00,['2006/12/16 09:00'],"['2006/07/11 00:00 [received]', '2006/11/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2006/12/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/03/10 09:00 [medline]', '2006/12/16 09:00 [entrez]']","['7601475 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.emboj.7601475 [doi]']",ppublish,EMBO J. 2007 Jan 10;26(1):41-52. doi: 10.1038/sj.emboj.7601475.

Further studies are ongoing to confirm the prognostic value of CTGF expression in ALL and to investigate its role in normal and abnormal lymphocyte biology.","['Sala-Torra, Olga', 'Gundacker, Holly M', 'Stirewalt, Derek L', 'Ladne, Paula A', 'Pogosova-Agadjanyan, Era L', 'Slovak, Marilyn L', 'Willman, Cheryl L', 'Heimfeld, Shelly', 'Boldt, David H', 'Radich, Jerald P']","['Sala-Torra O', 'Gundacker HM', 'Stirewalt DL', 'Ladne PA', 'Pogosova-Agadjanyan EL', 'Slovak ML', 'Willman CL', 'Heimfeld S', 'Boldt DH', 'Radich JP']","['Clinical Research Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA, USA. osala@fhcrc.org']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (CCN2 protein, human)', '0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (Immediate-Early Proteins)', '0 (Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '139568-91-5 (Connective Tissue Growth Factor)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Base Sequence', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/genetics/mortality', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Connective Tissue Growth Factor', 'DNA Primers/genetics', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Humans', 'Immediate-Early Proteins/*genetics', 'Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/*genetics', 'Middle Aged', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics/mortality', 'Prognosis', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Survival Rate']",,2006/12/16 09:00,2007/06/01 09:00,['2006/12/16 09:00'],"['2006/12/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/06/01 09:00 [medline]', '2006/12/16 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)41816-6 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2006-06-031096 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2007 Apr 1;109(7):3080-3. doi: 10.1182/blood-2006-06-031096.,,,,,PMC1852221,,"['P01 CA018029/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA114762/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA18029/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA32102/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Mutations of CEBPA are found in a subset of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and in some cases of familial AML. Here, using cytogenetics, fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), and molecular cloning, we show that 5 CEBP gene family members are targeted by recurrent IGH chromosomal translocations in BCP-ALL. Ten patients with t(8;14)(q11;q32) involved CEBPD on chromosome 8, and 9 patients with t(14;19)(q32;q13) involved CEBPA, while a further patient involved CEBPG, located 71 kb telomeric of CEBPA in chromosome band 19q13; 4 patients with inv(14)(q11q32)/t(14;14)(q11;q32) involved CEBPE and 3 patients with t(14;20)(q32;q13) involved CEBPB. In 16 patients the translocation breakpoints were cloned using long-distance inverse-polymerase chain reaction (LDI-PCR). With the exception of CEBPD breakpoints, which were scattered within a 43-kb region centromeric of CEBPD, translocation breakpoints were clustered immediately 5' or 3' of the involved CEBP gene. Except in 1 patient with t(14;14)(q11;q32), the involved CEBP genes retained germ-line sequences. Quantitative reverse transcription (RT)-PCR showed overexpression of the translocated CEBP gene. Our findings implicate the CEBP gene family as novel oncogenes in BCP-ALL, and suggest opposing functions of CEBP dysregulation in myeloid and lymphoid leukemogenesis.","['Akasaka, Takashi', 'Balasas, Theodore', 'Russell, Lisa J', 'Sugimoto, Kei-ji', 'Majid, Aneela', 'Walewska, Renata', 'Karran, E Loraine', 'Brown, David G', 'Cain, Kelvin', 'Harder, Lana', 'Gesk, Stefan', 'Martin-Subero, Jose Ignacio', 'Atherton, Mark G', 'Bruggemann, Monika', 'Calasanz, Maria Jose', 'Davies, Teresa', 'Haas, Oskar A', 'Hagemeijer, Anne', 'Kempski, Helena', 'Lessard, Michel', 'Lillington, Debra M', 'Moore, Sarah', 'Nguyen-Khac, Florence', 'Radford-Weiss, Isabelle', 'Schoch, Claudia', 'Struski, Stephanie', 'Talley, Polly', 'Welham, Melanie J', 'Worley, Helen', 'Strefford, Jon C', 'Harrison, Christine J', 'Siebert, Reiner', 'Dyer, Martin J S']","['Akasaka T', 'Balasas T', 'Russell LJ', 'Sugimoto KJ', 'Majid A', 'Walewska R', 'Karran EL', 'Brown DG', 'Cain K', 'Harder L', 'Gesk S', 'Martin-Subero JI', 'Atherton MG', 'Bruggemann M', 'Calasanz MJ', 'Davies T', 'Haas OA', 'Hagemeijer A', 'Kempski H', 'Lessard M', 'Lillington DM', 'Moore S', 'Nguyen-Khac F', 'Radford-Weiss I', 'Schoch C', 'Struski S', 'Talley P', 'Welham MJ', 'Worley H', 'Strefford JC', 'Harrison CJ', 'Siebert R', 'Dyer MJ']","['Toxicology Unit, Medical Research Council, University of Leicester, Lancaster Road, Leicester, UK.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20061214,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)']",IM,"['Burkitt Lymphoma/*genetics', 'CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Proteins/*genetics', 'Centromere/genetics', 'Chromosomes, Human/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/*genetics', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Multigene Family/*genetics', 'Oncogenes/*genetics', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Telomere/genetics', '*Translocation, Genetic']",,2006/12/16 09:00,2007/05/24 09:00,['2006/12/16 09:00'],"['2006/12/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/05/24 09:00 [medline]', '2006/12/16 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)41722-7 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2006-08-041012 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2007 Apr 15;109(8):3451-61. doi: 10.1182/blood-2006-08-041012.

We present centrally reviewed cytogenetic data from 1522 adult patients enrolled on the Medical Research Council (MRC) UKALLXII/Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) 2993 trial. The incidence and clinical associations for more than 20 specific chromosomal abnormalities are presented. Patients with a Ph chromosome, t(4;11)(q21;q23), t(8;14)(q24.1;q32), complex karyotype (5 or more chromosomal abnormalities), or low hypodiploidy/near triploidy (Ho-Tr) all had inferior rates of event-free and overall survival when compared with other patients. In contrast, patients with high hyperdiploidy or a del(9p) had a significantly improved outcome. Multivariate analysis demonstrated that the prognostic relevance of t(8;14), complex karyotype, and Ho-Tr was independent of sex, age, white cell count, and T-cell status among Ph-negative patients. The observation that Ho-Tr and, for the first time, karyotype complexity confer an increased risk of treatment failure demonstrates that cytogenetic subgroups other than the Ph chromosome can and should be used to risk stratify adults with ALL in future trials.","['Moorman, Anthony V', 'Harrison, Christine J', 'Buck, Georgina A N', 'Richards, Sue M', 'Secker-Walker, Lorna M', 'Martineau, Mary', 'Vance, Gail H', 'Cherry, Athena M', 'Higgins, Rodney R', 'Fielding, Adele K', 'Foroni, Letizia', 'Paietta, Elisabeth', 'Tallman, Martin S', 'Litzow, Mark R', 'Wiernik, Peter H', 'Rowe, Jacob M', 'Goldstone, Anthony H', 'Dewald, Gordon W']","['Moorman AV', 'Harrison CJ', 'Buck GA', 'Richards SM', 'Secker-Walker LM', 'Martineau M', 'Vance GH', 'Cherry AM', 'Higgins RR', 'Fielding AK', 'Foroni L', 'Paietta E', 'Tallman MS', 'Litzow MR', 'Wiernik PH', 'Rowe JM', 'Goldstone AH', 'Dewald GW']","['Leukaemia Research Cytogenetics Group, Cancer Sciences Division, University of Southampton, Southampton General Hospital, Southampton, UK. avm@soton.ac.uk']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20061214,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,,IM,"['Adult', '*Chromosome Deletion', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Multivariate Analysis', '*Philadelphia Chromosome', '*Ploidies', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/blood/*genetics/mortality/therapy', 'Risk Factors', 'Survival Rate', 'Treatment Failure']",,2006/12/16 09:00,2007/05/24 09:00,['2006/12/16 09:00'],"['2006/12/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/05/24 09:00 [medline]', '2006/12/16 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)41688-X [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2006-10-051912 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2007 Apr 15;109(8):3189-97. doi: 10.1182/blood-2006-10-051912.

ATRA has therapeutically been used against various malignancies including acute promyelocytic leukemia. Recently ATRA has also been recognized to be beneficial against atherosclerotic vascular disorders. However, its effects on angiogenesis remain controversial. We therefore examined ATRA effects on in vitro angiogenesis in terms of capillary-like tube formation using human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs)/normal human dermal fibroblast (NHDF) coculture. ATRA as well as RAR agonist Am80 significantly induced capillary-like tube formation. The ATRA-induced tube formation was inhibited by coincubation with RAR antagonist LE540/LE135. HUVEC proliferation, but not its migration, was also induced by ATRA. The ATRA-induced tube formation was completely abolished by coincubation with vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) neutralizing antibody or with VEGF receptor (VEGFR)-2 (KDR) neutralizing antibody, but not VEGFR-1 (Flt-1) neutralizing antibody. ATRA and Am80 induced VEGF secretion in the coculture as well as VEGF secretion/mRNA expression in NHDFs. Transcription activity of human VEGF gene promoter in NHDFs was stimulated by ATRA, which was augmented by RAR overexpression. ATRA also induced VDGFR-2/KDR mRNA expression in HUVECs. Moreover, ATRA-induced secretion of hepatocyte growth factor as well as angiopoietin-2 in the coculture. Taken together, ATRA may have induced angiogenesis via RAR mainly by stimulation of HUVEC proliferation and enhancement of endogenous VEGF signaling and in part by induction of hepatocyte growth factor and angiopoietin-2 production. Retinoids may therefore be potential candidates for therapeutic angiogenesis against ischemic vascular disorders.","['Saito, Akiko', 'Sugawara, Akira', 'Uruno, Akira', 'Kudo, Masataka', 'Kagechika, Hiroyuki', 'Sato, Yasufumi', 'Owada, Yuji', 'Kondo, Hisatake', 'Sato, Mayumi', 'Kurabayashi, Masahiko', 'Imaizumi, Masue', 'Tsuchiya, Shigeru', 'Ito, Sadayoshi']","['Saito A', 'Sugawara A', 'Uruno A', 'Kudo M', 'Kagechika H', 'Sato Y', 'Owada Y', 'Kondo H', 'Sato M', 'Kurabayashi M', 'Imaizumi M', 'Tsuchiya S', 'Ito S']","['Department of Medicine, Tohoku University Graduate School of Medicine, 1-1 Seiryo-cho, Aoba-ku, Sendai 980-8574, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20061214,United States,Endocrinology,Endocrinology,0375040,"['0 (Angiopoietin-2)', '0 (Receptors, Retinoic Acid)', '0 (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', '67256-21-7 (Hepatocyte Growth Factor)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Receptor-2)']",IM,"['Angiopoietin-2/metabolism', 'Capillaries/drug effects/growth & development', 'Cell Movement/drug effects', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Hepatocyte Growth Factor/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Neovascularization, Physiologic/*drug effects', 'Paracrine Communication/*physiology', 'Receptors, Retinoic Acid/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Tretinoin/*pharmacology', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A/*physiology', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Receptor-2/metabolism']",,2006/12/16 09:00,2007/04/05 09:00,['2006/12/16 09:00'],"['2006/12/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/04/05 09:00 [medline]', '2006/12/16 09:00 [entrez]']","['en.2006-0900 [pii]', '10.1210/en.2006-0900 [doi]']",ppublish,Endocrinology. 2007 Mar;148(3):1412-23. doi: 10.1210/en.2006-0900.

Advances in culture techniques and AML-DC characterization justify clinical application. However, additional measures are likely needed to potentiate vaccines and overcome the intrinsic tolerant state of the patients' immune system. Engagement of the costimulatory molecule 4-1BB can break immunologic tolerance and increase CTL responses. In this study, we examined the role of the 4-1BB ligand (4-1BBL) on T-cell responses induced by AML-DC. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: In allogeneic and autologous cocultures of T cells and AML-DC, the effect of the addition of 4-1BBL on T-cell proliferation, T-cell subpopulations, and T-cell function was determined. RESULTS: Addition of 4-1BBL to cocultures of AML-DC and T cells induced a preferential increase in the proliferation of CD8(+) T cells. Increased differentiation into effector and central memory populations was observed in both CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells in the presence of 4-1BBL. AML-DC induce a T helper 1 response, characterized by high IFN-gamma production, which is significantly increased by targeting 4-1BB. T cells primed in the presence of 4-1BBL show specificity for the leukemia-associated antigen Wilms' tumor 1, whereas cytotoxicity assays with leukemic blast targets showed the cytolytic potential of T cells primed in the presence of 4-1BBL. CONCLUSION: We conclude that 4-1BBL is an effective adjuvant to enhance T-cell responses elicited by AML-DC.","['Houtenbos, Ilse', 'Westers, Theresia M', 'Dijkhuis, Annemiek', 'de Gruijl, Tanja D', 'Ossenkoppele, Gert J', 'van de Loosdrecht, Arjan A']","['Houtenbos I', 'Westers TM', 'Dijkhuis A', 'de Gruijl TD', 'Ossenkoppele GJ', 'van de Loosdrecht AA']","['Department of Hematology, VU University Medical Center, Amsterdam, the Netherlands.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20061214,United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Ligands)', '0 (TNFRSF9 protein, human)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor Receptor Superfamily, Member 9)']",IM,"['CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/metabolism', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Cytokines/metabolism', 'Dendritic Cells/*cytology/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*metabolism', 'Ligands', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'T-Lymphocytes/*metabolism', 'Time Factors', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor Receptor Superfamily, Member 9/*metabolism']",,2006/12/16 09:00,2007/04/14 09:00,['2006/12/16 09:00'],"['2006/12/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/04/14 09:00 [medline]', '2006/12/16 09:00 [entrez]']","['1078-0432.CCR-06-1430 [pii]', '10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-06-1430 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2007 Jan 1;13(1):307-15. doi: 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-06-1430.

It has been hypothesized that benzene and natural estrogens initiate cancer by forming ortho-quinones (catechol quinones) that react with DNA in cells. These quinones form depurinating DNA adducts that generate the mutations leading to cancer. This study examined whether the treatment of normal human peripheral blood mononuclear cells with the ortho-quinones of benzene or estradiol would form DNA adducts and elicit an alteration in the proliferation of these cells. Both estradiol-3,4-quinone and benzene ortho-quinone formed depurinating DNA adducts and significantly increased the mitogen-induced proliferation of normal blood mononuclear cells. Immunophenotyping of the estradiol-3,4-quinone-treated blood cells indicated that monocyte/macrophage, natural killer and T-cells were particularly prone to hyperproliferation. Thus, DNA damage induced by the ortho-quinones of benzene and estradiol may promote the growth of human blood mononuclear cells, including those that appear in large numbers in leukemia and lymphoma.","['Chakravarti, Dhrubajyoti', 'Zahid, Muhammad', 'Backora, Matthew', 'Myers, Erin M', 'Gaikwad, Nilesh', 'Weisenburger, Dennis D', 'Cavalieri, Ercole L', 'Rogan, Eleanor G', 'Joshi, Shantaram S']","['Chakravarti D', 'Zahid M', 'Backora M', 'Myers EM', 'Gaikwad N', 'Weisenburger DD', 'Cavalieri EL', 'Rogan EG', 'Joshi SS']","['Eppley Institute for Research in Cancer and Allied Diseases, University of Nebraska Medical Center, Omaha, NE 68198, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",,United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,"['0 (DNA Adducts)', '0 (Estrogens)', '0 (Quinones)', '0 (estradiol-3,4-quinone)', '4TI98Z838E (Estradiol)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'J64922108F (Benzene)']",IM,"['Benzene/*chemistry', 'Cell Proliferation', 'DNA/metabolism', 'DNA Adducts/chemistry', 'Estradiol/analogs & derivatives/chemistry/pharmacology', 'Estrogens/*chemistry', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping/methods', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/*cytology', 'Models, Chemical', 'Mutation', 'Neoplasms/drug therapy', 'Quinones/*pharmacology', 'Time Factors']",,2006/12/16 09:00,2007/09/27 09:00,['2006/12/16 09:00'],"['2006/12/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/09/27 09:00 [medline]', '2006/12/16 09:00 [entrez]']","['W8655N471UG20422 [pii]', '10.1080/10428190600931937 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2006 Dec;47(12):2635-44. doi: 10.1080/10428190600931937.,,,,,,,"['P01 CA49210/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA36727/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,

The cytotoxicity and specific pro-apoptotic effects of the study drugs on B-CLL cells were assessed in vitro in samples from overall 37 untreated patients. The combinations of SDX-101 with 2-CdA, FA or RIT exerted additive effects in B-CLL cells, with the following combination indices (CI): 0.89 for SDX-101 + 2-CdA, 0.95 for SDX-101 + RIT, and 1.17 for SDX-101 + FA. The main mechanism of these interactions was caspase-mediated apoptosis. The SDX-101 plus ALT combination resulted in only sub-additive cytotoxicity (CI = 1.25).

This provided the rationale for a multicenter clinical trial in patients with refractory AML with SU5416, a small molecule kinase inhibitor which blocks phosphorylation of c-kit, FLT3, VEGFR-1, VEGFR-2 (KDR) and VEGFR-3. The levels of VEGF mRNA expression were investigated in peripheral blood leukemic blasts taken from AML patients before and during treatment with SU5416. Rapid down regulation of VEGF was observed in AML blasts from 72% (13 of 18) of patients analysed. Patients initially expressing high VEGF-levels had a stronger downregulation and a higher clinical response rate (mean 865-fold, n = 10, P = 0,01) than patients initially expressing low VEGF-levels (mean four-fold, n = 8). These results suggest that abnormal high VEGF expression is downregulated by SU5416 treatment, and furthermore that decreases in VEGF mRNA levels may provide an early marker of therapeutic response with anti-angiogenic therapy. Additionally, protein expression of STAT5 and AKT was assessed by western blotting in these patient samples, as well as in the leukemia cell line, M-07e, treated in vitro with SU5416 as a model system.

A total of five CMV reactivations occurred, four in the acyclovir and one in the ganciclovir prophylaxis group. Alemtuzumab was then discontinued and all patients were treated with iv ganciclovir 7.5 mg/kg per day. All patients achieved negative CMV anti genemia after a median of 15 days of therapy.

GS was diagnosed simultaneously with leukemia in five cases and preceded the leukemia in eight. Lymph node and soft tissue were the most commonly detected localizations. Seven cases had first been diagnosed as NHL. Histopathologically blastic, immature and mature variants were found in 11, nine and 11 cases respectively and overall survival was shortest in the blastic type. Myeloperoxidase and lysozyme were found to be positive in 30 and 24 cases respectively. Therapy was radiation in five cases and surgery in three. Systemic chemotherapy was given to the cases. The clinical outcome of the patients after the diagnosis of GS was poor. GS is a unique entity; prognosis is poor but it is important to detect the signaling pathways associated with migration of myeloid cells to the extra-medullary tissues. The critical factors for detecting this interesting tumor are to be aware of this disease, cooperation between clinician and pathologist and the application of special stains to detect the myeloid origin.","['Paydas, Semra', 'Zorludemir, Suzan', 'Ergin, Melek']","['Paydas S', 'Zorludemir S', 'Ergin M']","['Department of Oncology, Cukurova University Faculty of Medicine, Adana, Turkey. sepay@cu.edu.tr']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Biopsy', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/therapy', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/therapy', 'Male', 'Medical Oncology/methods', 'Middle Aged', 'Sarcoma, Myeloid/*diagnosis', 'Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Treatment Outcome']",,2006/12/16 09:00,2007/09/27 09:00,['2006/12/16 09:00'],"['2006/12/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/09/27 09:00 [medline]', '2006/12/16 09:00 [entrez]']","['M474W755V610N3W8 [pii]', '10.1080/10428190600967196 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2006 Dec;47(12):2527-41. doi: 10.1080/10428190600967196.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

There were 105 AML and 48 ALL cases identified. Ninety percent of female patients were younger than 50 and leukemia was temporally related to pregnancy in 13. Eight cases were males.

A number of genotoxicity studies have been conducted using these materials with results conflicting so far. Thus, the approach was aimed to look at the genotoxic and cytotoxic potential of three different glass-ionomer cements available commercially (Ketac Cem, Ketac Molar and Vitrebond) by the single cell gel (comet) assay and trypan blue exclusion test, respectively. For this, such materials were exposed to mouse lymphoma cells in vitro for 1 h at 37 degrees C. Data were assessed by Kruskall-Wallis non-parametric test. The results showed that all powders assayed did not show genotoxic effects. On the other hand, the liquid from Vitrebond at 0.1% dilution caused an increase of DNA injury. Significant statistically differences (P < 0.05) in cytotoxicity provoked by all powders tested were observed for exposure at 1,000 micro g mL(-1) concentration and 100 micro g mL(-1) for Ketac Molar. With respect to liquids of glass-ionomer cements evaluated, the major toxic effect on cell viability was produced at 1%, beginning at the dilution of 0.5% for Vitrebond. Taken together, these results support the notion that some components of glass-ionomer cements show both genotoxic and cytotoxic effects in higher concentrations.","['Ribeiro, D A', 'Marques, M E A', 'Salvadori, D M F']","['Ribeiro DA', 'Marques ME', 'Salvadori DM']","['Department of Health Sciences, Federal University of Sao Paulo, UNIFESP, SP, Brazil. araki@fmb.unesp.br']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,J Oral Rehabil,Journal of oral rehabilitation,0433604,"['0 (Dental Materials)', '0 (Glass Ionomer Cements)', '0 (Polycarboxylate Cement)', '0 (ketac-molar)', '126338-82-7 (Vitrabond)', '3A3U0GI71G (Magnesium Oxide)', '86473-14-5 (Ketac-cem)', 'I2ZWO3LS3M (Trypan Blue)', 'SOI2LOH54Z (Zinc Oxide)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Comet Assay', '*DNA Damage', 'Dental Materials/*toxicity', 'Glass Ionomer Cements/*toxicity', 'Leukemia L5178', 'Magnesium Oxide/toxicity', 'Materials Testing', 'Mice', 'Polycarboxylate Cement/toxicity', 'Statistics, Nonparametric', 'Trypan Blue', 'Zinc Oxide/toxicity']",,2006/12/16 09:00,2007/09/28 09:00,['2006/12/16 09:00'],"['2006/12/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/09/28 09:00 [medline]', '2006/12/16 09:00 [entrez]']","['JOR1658 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1365-2842.2006.01658.x [doi]']",ppublish,J Oral Rehabil. 2006 Dec;33(12):912-7. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2842.2006.01658.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Three of them, fludarabine (FA), cladribine (2-chlorodeoxyadenosine, 2-CdA) and pentostatin (2'-deoxycoformycin, DCF) have established clinical activity in hematological malignancies and have been approved by FDA. These drugs are also investigated in some autoimmune diosorders. Recently four novel PNA: clofarabine (CAFdA), nelarabine, immucillin H (BCX-1777, forodesine) and 8-chloroadenosine (8-Cl-Ado) have been synthesized and introduced into clinical trials. All these drugs have chemical structure similar to adenosine or guanosine, however, the mechanism of their action is different. FA, 2-CdA and CAFdA mainly require phosphorylation by deoxynucleoside salvage pathways. The cytotoxic effect exerts the triphosphate metabolites, which are incorporated into DNA, and finally lead to programmed cell death. In contrast, DCF does not need to be phosphorylated and results in an increase of plasma deoxyadenosine (dAdo) levels and intracellular deoxyadenosine triphosphate (dATP). Nelarabine is an arabinosylguanine (ara-G) prodrug, which after conversion to ara-G is phosphorylated to ara-G triphosphate (ara-GTP). Accumulation of ara-GTP finally leads to apoptosis. Forodesine is a purine nucleoside phosphatase (PNP) inhibitor which blocks intracellular deoxyguanine (dGuo) cleaving to guanine (Guo), but instead converts it to deoxyguanosine triphosphate (dGTP), and similarly to other PNA resulting in apoptosis. 8-chloroadenosine (8-Cl-Ado) is a ribonucleoside analog. The mechanism of its action is quite different from other PNA and remains poorly understood. However, it is known that the drug inhibits RNA synthesis, but not DNA. These agents have significant cytotoxic activity against lymphoid and myeloid malignant cells. Moreover, they have deleterious effects on the normal resting lymphocytes. They result in prolonged lymphocyte depletion especially in the CD4 subset of T-cells. Several clinical trials have demonstrated that PNA used alone or in combination with other cytotoxic drugs or monoclonal antibodies shows good efficacy and acceptable toxicity profile in the treatment of lymphoid malignancies. 2-CdA and DCF are drugs of choice in the treatment of hairy cell leukemia. FA and 2-CdA have significant clinical activity in low-grade non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and chronic lymphocytic leukemia. 2-CdA exhibits some activity in progressive multiple sclerosis and other autoimmune disorders. This review will summarize current knowledge concerning the mechanism of action, pharmacological properties, clinical activity and toxicity of PNA accepted for use in clinical practice as well as new agents available for clinical trials.","['Robak, Tadeusz', 'Lech-Maranda, Ewa', 'Korycka, Anna', 'Robak, Ewa']","['Robak T', 'Lech-Maranda E', 'Korycka A', 'Robak E']","['Department of Hematology, Medical University of Lodz and Copernicus Memorial Hospital, Pabianicka 62, Lodz, Poland. robaktad@csk.umed.lodz.pl']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United Arab Emirates,Curr Med Chem,Current medicinal chemistry,9440157,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)', '0 (Purine Nucleosides)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Autoimmune Diseases/drug therapy', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/drug therapy', 'Humans', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Purine Nucleosides/metabolism/*pharmacology/therapeutic use']",,2006/12/16 09:00,2007/03/01 09:00,['2006/12/16 09:00'],"['2006/12/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/03/01 09:00 [medline]', '2006/12/16 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.2174/092986706778742918 [doi]'],ppublish,Curr Med Chem. 2006;13(26):3165-89. doi: 10.2174/092986706778742918.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

One of its major metabolic pathways involves O-demethylation to etoposide catechol (etoposide-OH) by cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4). The catechol metabolite can undergo sequential one- and two-electron oxidations to form etoposide semi-quinone (etoposide-SQ) and etoposide quinone (etoposide-Q), respectively, which have both been implicated as cytotoxic metabolites. However, etoposide-Q is known to react with glutathione (GSH), which can protect DNA from oxidative damage by this reactive metabolite. In this study, etoposide-Q was reacted with GSH and the two etoposide-GSH conjugates were characterized. The major conjugate was etoposide-OH-6'-SG and the minor product was etoposide-OH-2'-SG. Etoposide-OH-6'-SG, which arose from Michael addition of GSH to etoposide-Q, was characterized by mass spectrometry and 2-D NMR. It was identified as the sole product from in vitro metabolism experiments using recombinant human CYP3A4 or liver microsomes incubated with etoposide in the presence of GSH. Etoposide-OH-6'-SG was also detected from incubations of etoposide-OH and GSH alone.

Bile acid homeostasis is tightly regulated in health, and their cellular and tissue concentrations are restricted. However, when pathophysiological processes impair their biliary secretion, hepatocytes are exposed to elevated concentrations of bile acids which trigger cell death. In this context, we developed several newly synthesized bile acid derivatives. These synthetic bile acids modulated the cell cycle and induced apoptosis in several human cancer cells similar to natural bile acids. In human breast and prostate cancer cells with different tumor suppressor p53 status, synthetic bile acid-induced growth inhibition and apoptosis were associated with up-regulation of Bax and p21(WAF1/CIP1) via a p53-independent pathway. In Jurkat human T cell leukemia cells, the synthetic bile acids induced apoptosis through caspase activation. In addition to this, the synthetic bile acids induced apoptosis in a JNK dependent manner in SiHa human cervical cancer cells, via induction of Bax and activation of caspases in PC3 prostate cancer cells and induction of G1 phase arrest in the cell cycle in HT29 colon cancer cells. Moreover, they induced apoptosis in four human glioblastoma multiform cell lines (i.e., U-118MG, U-87MG, T98G, and U-373MG) and one human TE671 medulloblastoma cells. In addition to this, a chenodeoxycholic acid derivative, called HS-1200, significantly decreased the growth of TE671 medulloblastoma tumor size and increased life span in non-obese diabetic and severe combined immunodeficient (NOD/SCID) mice. Therefore, these new synthetic bile acids, which are novel apoptosis mediators, might be applicable to the treatment of various human cancer cells.","['Kim, Nam Deuk', 'Im, Eunok', 'Yoo, Young Hyun', 'Choi, Yung Hyun']","['Kim ND', 'Im E', 'Yoo YH', 'Choi YH']","['Division of Pharmacy (Brain Korea 21 Program), Pusan National University, Research Institute for Drug Development, Busan 609-735, South Korea. nadkim@pusan.ac.kr']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",,Netherlands,Curr Cancer Drug Targets,Current cancer drug targets,101094211,['0 (Bile Acids and Salts)'],IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Bile Acids and Salts/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Cell Cycle/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Mitochondria/drug effects/physiology', 'Neoplasms/*drug therapy/pathology']",120,2006/12/16 09:00,2007/01/09 09:00,['2006/12/16 09:00'],"['2006/12/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/01/09 09:00 [medline]', '2006/12/16 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.2174/156800906779010236 [doi]'],ppublish,Curr Cancer Drug Targets. 2006 Dec;6(8):681-9. doi: 10.2174/156800906779010236.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The Janus kinase-signal transducer and activator of transcription (JAK-STAT) pathway is prominent both in normal hematopoiesis and in hematological malignancies. STATs are phosphorylated on tyrosine residues via JAK kinases and on serine residues by a variety of serine/threonine kinases. STATs then dimerize, translocate to the nucleus and bind DNA, initiating the transcription of target genes. STAT proteins mediate cell growth, differentiation, apoptosis, transformation, and other fundamental cell functions. Recently, mutations in the JAK2 gene driving the proliferation of the neoplastic clone have been identified in myeloproliferative disorders. In addition constitutive activation of the JAK-STAT pathway has been reported in various types of leukemias such as acute myelogenous leukemia, T-LGL leukemia, and multiple myeloma.

Constitutively activated tyrosine kinases play a role in the malignant phenotype in a number of different cancers. While the kinases may be present in the normal cell, the cancer cell is often dependent upon the activation of the kinase for the maintenance of malignant growth. Inhibition of kinase activation may therefore selectively inhibit malignant proliferation. In the case of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), the activated tyrosine kinase (BCR-ABL) is due to a chromosomal translocation that defines this disease, and is necessary for malignant transformation. Imatinib mesylate (Gleevec, Novartis) is a small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor, developed through the chemical modification to be selected for a small number of tyrosine kinases present in human cells. This agent is also orally bioavailable and has been found to be effective in clinical trials. We have learned much through the clinical use of this agent. 1) Specific targeting of activated signal transduction pathways may be effective in inhibiting cancer cells. 2) Cancer cells may not only be inherently resistant to small molecule inhibitors, but may also develop resistance after exposure to the inhibitor. 3) Increased knowledge regarding critical signal transduction pathways, the structure of the molecules that are being targeted and the inhibitors themselves, will allow us to understand resistance as it develops and create new molecules to bypass resistance. We will discuss imatinib as an important example of the success and pitfalls of targeted therapeutics for cancer.","['Ritchie, E', 'Nichols, G']","['Ritchie E', 'Nichols G']","['Department of Hematology, New York-Presbyterian Hospital, Columbia and Cornell Universities, New York, NY 10032, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,Netherlands,Curr Cancer Drug Targets,Current cancer drug targets,101094211,"['0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Benzamides', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/antagonists & inhibitors/chemistry/physiology', 'Genes, abl', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy', 'Mutation', 'Piperazines/administration & dosage/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*therapeutic use', 'Pyrimidines/administration & dosage/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Signal Transduction']",85,2006/12/16 09:00,2007/01/09 09:00,['2006/12/16 09:00'],"['2006/12/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/01/09 09:00 [medline]', '2006/12/16 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.2174/156800906779010209 [doi]'],ppublish,Curr Cancer Drug Targets. 2006 Dec;6(8):645-57. doi: 10.2174/156800906779010209.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recently, a durable remission with minimal toxicity by single agent ATO or ATO + ATRA in newly diagnosed APL was reported by different groups. These regimens have minimal toxicity and can be administered on an outpatient basis after remission induction, thus they could become a real, less toxic and more economic option to ATRA + anthracyclines in particular in low risk APL, or in patients that cannot undergo chemotherapy because of age or comorbid conditions and in patients that refuse chemotherapy. Significantly, these therapies are a successful attempt to cure a tumoral disease without chemotherapy. The results of clinical trials of ATO administration as single agent in multiple myeloma (MM) and myelodisplastic syndromes (MDS) were encouraging and showed clinical effects but they were not close to APL success. On the contrary, results of clinical trials to treat non-APL acute myeloid leukemia (AML) were disappointing. We suggest that a combination therapy with drugs targeting specific pro-survival molecules or capable to enhance pro-apoptotic pathways may lead to an improvement of ATO efficacy against hematological malignancies, in particular AML. Our pre-clinical studies showed that ATO is capable to induce cell death in acute leukemia cells but the apoptotic function is limited since it can induce also a mechanism of cell defense by activating pro-survival molecules such as MEK-ERK, Bcl-xL, Bcl-2. By combining ATO with specific MEK inhibitors, we demonstrated that the block of MEK-ERK phosphorylation, the induction of Bad de-phosphorylation, and activation of p53AIP1 apoptotic pathway interrupt the pro-survival mechanisms of ATO and kill the leukemic cells by apoptotic synergism. Our results provide an experimental basis for combined or sequential treatment with MEK inhibitors and ATO in AML. The renaissance of ATO as a drug in moderne medicine may be considered, together with ATRA success, a victory of empirical analysis, that had (and has) great impact on Chinese culture.","['Bonati, A', 'Rizzoli, V', 'Lunghi, P']","['Bonati A', 'Rizzoli V', 'Lunghi P']","['Department of Clinical Sciences, University of Parma, Italy. antbonny@unipr.it']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",,Netherlands,Curr Pharm Biotechnol,Current pharmaceutical biotechnology,100960530,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (Oxides)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals/*therapeutic use', 'Clinical Trials as Topic/*trends', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*drug therapy', 'Humans', 'Multiple Myeloma/*drug therapy', 'Oxides/*therapeutic use', ""Practice Patterns, Physicians'/trends"", 'Treatment Outcome']",62,2006/12/16 09:00,2007/01/11 09:00,['2006/12/16 09:00'],"['2006/12/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/01/11 09:00 [medline]', '2006/12/16 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.2174/138920106779116829 [doi]'],ppublish,Curr Pharm Biotechnol. 2006 Dec;7(6):397-405. doi: 10.2174/138920106779116829.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is evident from many studies, that the division into two main prognostic categories is possible on the basis of mutation status of the immunoglobulin heavy-chain gene. The objective of our work was to identify a presence or absence of IgVH gene mutations in B-CLL patients which are monitored or treated on hematological clinics and to determine the presence of individual D and J, subgenes in malignant population of B-cells. METHODS AND RESULTS: A nucleotide sequence of IgVH gene of neoplastic cells was analyzed by appropriate molecular-genetic methods. RNA/cDNA was collected from 358 patients and a spectrum of individual subgenes translocations was identified. Our results show that 56.3% of patients manifested an unmutated variable (VH) segment. It is expected from the published data that this group of patients will suffer from aggressive course of the disease and will exhibit a substantially shorter survival in comparison to patients possessing somatic hypermutations. An expanded population of leukemic B-cells showed increased occurrence of clones whose variable segments belong to three different families. VH3 alleles are the ones most frequently used. A frequency of unmutated alleles is prominently shifted into families with V I homology. The preferred ""diversity and joining"" segments are D3, D2 and JH 4 and JH 6. CONCLUSIONS: The analysis of heavy chain immunoglobulin gene after recombinant VH-D-J11 segments translocation belongs to a standard hematooncological investigation. The results are an important prognostic criterion for prediction of expected disease aggressivity and for a minimal residual disease monitoring.","['Kuhrova, V', 'Francova, H', 'Klimesova, D', 'Brychtova, Y', 'Doubek, M', 'Trbusek, M', 'Brejcha, M', 'Dvorakova, D', 'Mayer, J']","['Kuhrova V', 'Francova H', 'Klimesova D', 'Brychtova Y', 'Doubek M', 'Trbusek M', 'Brejcha M', 'Dvorakova D', 'Mayer J']","['Centrum molekularni biologie a genove terapie FN, Brno. vkuhrova@fnbrno.cz']",['cze'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",,Czech Republic,Cas Lek Cesk,Casopis lekaru ceskych,0004743,['0 (Immunoglobulin Variable Region)'],IM,"['*Base Sequence', 'Genes, Immunoglobulin Heavy Chain/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Variable Region', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*genetics/pathology', '*Mutation', 'Prognosis', 'Translocation, Genetic']",,2006/12/16 09:00,2007/02/08 09:00,['2006/12/16 09:00'],"['2006/12/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/02/08 09:00 [medline]', '2006/12/16 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cas Lek Cesk. 2006;145(11):855-8; discussion 859-60.,,,,Molekularne -geneticka charakterizace agresivity chronicke lymfocytarni leukemie u ceskych pacientu: nukleotidova variabilita genu kodujicich syntezu tezkeho retezce imunoglobulinu.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

CXCR4 is a G-protein-coupled receptor that transduces signals of its endogenous ligand, the chemokine CXCL12 (stromal cell-derived factor-1, SDF-1). The interaction between CXCL12 and CXCR4 plays an important role in the migration of progenitors during embryologic development of the cardiovascular, hemopoietic, central nervous systems, and so on. This interaction is also known to be involved in several intractable disease processes, including HIV infection, cancer cell metastasis, leukemia cell progression, rheumatoid arthritis (RA), and pulmonary fibrosis. It is conjectured that this interaction may be a critical therapeutic target in all of these diseases, and several CXCR4 antagonists have been proposed as potential drugs. Fourteen-mer peptides, T140 and its analogues, were previously developed in our laboratory as specific CXCR4 antagonists that were identified as HIV-entry inhibitors, anti-cancer-metastatic agents, anti-chronic lymphocytic/acute lymphoblastic leukemia agents, and anti-RA agents. Cyclic pentapeptides, such as FC131 [cyclo(D-Tyr-Arg-Arg-L-3-(2-naphthyl)alanine-Gly)], were also previously found as CXCR4 antagonist leads based on pharmacophores of T140. This review article describes the elucidation of multiple functions of CXCR4 antagonists and the development of a number of low-molecular weight CXCR4 antagonists involving FC131 analogues and other compounds with different scaffolds including linear-type structures.","['Tsutsumi, Hiroshi', 'Tanaka, Tomohiro', 'Ohashi, Nami', 'Masuno, Hiroyuki', 'Tamamura, Hirokazu', 'Hiramatsu, Kenichi', 'Araki, Takanobu', 'Ueda, Satoshi', 'Oishi, Shinya', 'Fujii, Nobutaka']","['Tsutsumi H', 'Tanaka T', 'Ohashi N', 'Masuno H', 'Tamamura H', 'Hiramatsu K', 'Araki T', 'Ueda S', 'Oishi S', 'Fujii N']","['Institute of Biomaterials and Bioengineering, Tokyo Medical and Dental University, Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",,United States,Biopolymers,Biopolymers,0372525,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Antirheumatic Agents)', '0 (Oligopeptides)', '0 (Peptides)', '0 (Receptors, CXCR4)', 'DA9G065962 (T140 peptide)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/chemistry/pharmacology', 'Antirheumatic Agents/chemistry/pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'HIV-1/drug effects/physiology', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Oligopeptides/chemistry/pharmacology', 'Peptides/*chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Receptors, CXCR4/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Virus Internalization/drug effects']",85,2006/12/15 09:00,2007/05/23 09:00,['2006/12/15 09:00'],"['2006/12/15 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/05/23 09:00 [medline]', '2006/12/15 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/bip.20653 [doi]'],ppublish,Biopolymers. 2007;88(2):279-89. doi: 10.1002/bip.20653.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The purpose of this study was to characterize in detail the phenotypes of heterogeneous population in various AML subtypes and to identify the leukemia associated aberrant phenotype (LAP) in individual patients with AML for precise investigation of MRD. The impact of heterogeneity of pathological populations, the effectiveness of location AML blasts on CD45/SSC dot plots in AML patients during follow-up and phenotype changes on MRD monitoring were evaluated in the second step. Bone marrow samples from 63 patients with AML were analyzed at diagnosis, 33 were selected for monitoring of MRD during follow-up and 13 analyzed at relapse using a wide antibody panel in quadruple combinations by multiparameter flow cytometry. In 88% of AML patients at least one LAP was defined at diagnosis, two or more aberrancies coexisted in 60% of them. The total number of LAPs identified by application of various combinations of antibodies was 112 (mean = 2.04 LAP/patient) and the median percentage of blasts carrying the LAP was 53.57%. In half of the patients, we were able to detect the presence of at least two subpopulations, which not always shared the same aberrancy. Although AML cells often have light scattering properties similar to those of normal (myeloid and B-lymphoid precursors, basophiles etc.) in a fraction of cases we found also very useful the location on CD45/SSC dot plots for MRD discrimination. In 13 patients relapse occurred and although we found in 69% changes of phenotype when comparing diagnosis and the first relapse, at least one LAP was constant in 92%. According to our observations, in majority of patients with AML monitoring of MRD by multiparameter flow cytometry is feasible although in some cases could present some specific difficulties owing to their immunophenotypic heterogeneity, similarity with other cell subpopulations or shifts at relapse. In conclusion, investigation of MRD should be based on the phenotypic characteristics of each subpopulation even if it is present in low frequencies.","['Zeleznikova, T', 'Babusikova, O']","['Zeleznikova T', 'Babusikova O']","['Cancer Research Institute, Slovak Academy of Sciences, 833 91 Bratislava, Slovak Republic. exontzel@savba.sk']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Slovakia,Neoplasma,Neoplasma,0377266,['EC 3.1.3.48 (Leukocyte Common Antigens)'],IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Blast Crisis/diagnosis/immunology', 'Bone Marrow/immunology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', '*Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/classification/*diagnosis/immunology', 'Leukocyte Common Antigens/metabolism', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local/diagnosis/immunology', 'Neoplasm, Residual/*diagnosis/immunology', 'Phenotype', 'Prognosis']",,2006/12/15 09:00,2007/03/14 09:00,['2006/12/15 09:00'],"['2006/12/15 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/03/14 09:00 [medline]', '2006/12/15 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Neoplasma. 2006;53(6):500-6.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The WT1 protein belongs to the early growth response family of zinc-finger transcription factors. Uniquely to WT1, an evolutionarily conserved alternative splice event inserts the tripeptide KTS, between zinc fingers 3 and 4. Whereas -KTS isoforms bind DNA and activate or repress transcription, +KTS isoforms bind DNA less efficiently and interact with splice factors and RNA in vitro and in vivo. Although candidate DNA targets have been found, physiological mRNA targets are yet to be defined. We examined the distribution of WT1 in ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complexes in nuclear extract prepared from M15 cells, a mouse mesonephric fetal kidney cell line. WT1 cofractionated with the splice factor PSF in large RNP particles >or=2 MDa. We also found that PSF co-immunoprecipitated with WT1, suggesting a functional interaction between these 2 multifunctional proteins. Using yeast three-hybrid library constructed from the co-immunoprecipitated RNA we found that WT1 (+KTS) binds close to or at the start codon of alpha-actinin 1 (ACTN1) mRNA. A band shift assay confirmed the ability of the WT1 zinc-finger domain (+KTS) to bind this sequence in vitro.

In elderly patients the presence of comorbidities, such as cardiomyopathy or different organ failures, often represents an absolute contraindication to standard chemotherapy. In this particular setting of patients, alternative front-line approaches are needed. Here we report the use of gemtuzumab ozogamicin as consolidation therapy in a 68-year-old patient not eligible for standard dose anthracycline due to severe cardiac failure and chronic anticoagulant therapy, affected by low-risk APL. Induction therapy was started with ATRA alone, at a dose of 45 mg/m2 for 80 days. The patient obtained a complete hematological and molecular remission. At day +170 the patient was treated with 6 mg/m2 gemtuzumab ozogamicin monthly for two months (2 total doses) as a consolidation therapy and then started a maintenance program with ATRA 45 mg/m2 for 15 days every three months, for a total time of two years. No adverse events were observed in every phase of treatment and the patient is still in complete continuous hematological and molecular remission 29 months from diagnosis. This approach represents an intriguing therapeutic option to be investigated in randomized studies in low- and intermediate-risk elderly patients (older than 65 years), aiming to minimize or to eliminate standard chemotherapy in advantage of new non-conventional agents, including ATO.","['Finizio, O', 'Pezzullo, L', 'Rocco, S', 'Bene, L', 'De Rosa, C', 'Nunziata, G R', 'Mettivier, V']","['Finizio O', 'Pezzullo L', 'Rocco S', 'Bene L', 'De Rosa C', 'Nunziata GR', 'Mettivier V']","['U.O.C.

The findings allowed us to design PCR primers that were directed to the conserved or specific nucleotide sequences for each subgroup of variable and joining genes.

METHODS: The long-term survival and relapse of 111 APL patients with different post-remission treatment were retrospectively analyzed. The patients were divided into four groups. Group 1: All-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA) + As(2)O(3) + chemotherapy; Group 2: ATRA + chemotherapy; Group 3: As(2)O(3) + chemotherapy; Group 4: chemotherapy alone. The median follow-up time was 32 (6 - 185) months. RESULTS: A total of 85 patients survived without diseases, 18 patients died and 8 patients dropped out. In the four groups, the patients survived without disease were (36/40, 23/30, 21/26, 5/15), respectively. The cases of patients survived over 3 years were (16/40, 12/30, 11/26, 1/15), respectively. The patients died were (3/40, 5/30, 5/26, 5/15), respectively. The estimated 5-year overall survival (OS) and relapse-free survival (RFS) were (78.3 +/- 4.9)%, (76.9 +/- 5.1)%, respectively. There were 21 patients relapsed. CONCLUSION: The APL patients receiving combined post-remission therapy had better OS and RFS those receiving chemotherapy alone. Sequential therapy combining ATRA, As(2)O(3) and chemotherapy is the best post-remission therapy for long-term survival of APL patients.","['Li, Xin', 'Zhao, Yao-zhong', 'Li, Zeng-jun', 'Yang, Ren-chi', 'Han, Ming-zhe', 'Qiu, Lu-gui']","['Li X', 'Zhao YZ', 'Li ZJ', 'Yang RC', 'Han MZ', 'Qiu LG']","['Institute of Haematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Science, Chinese Union Medical College, Tianjin 300020, China.']",['chi'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",,China,Zhonghua Nei Ke Za Zhi,Zhonghua nei ke za zhi,16210490R,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Child', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*drug therapy/*mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', '*Remission Induction', 'Young Adult']",,2006/12/15 09:00,2009/07/10 09:00,['2006/12/15 09:00'],"['2006/12/15 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/07/10 09:00 [medline]', '2006/12/15 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Zhonghua Nei Ke Za Zhi. 2006 Sep;45(9):741-3.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: We selected 55 patients with acute erythroid leukemia and reviewed the cytogenetic characteristics of these cases. With case-control studies, 55 patients were classified as primary or MDS transformed leukemia depending on the absence or presence of MDS history. In addition, we also classified these 55 cases as normal or abnormal karyotype. We analyzed the treatment response to allogenic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation or chemotherapy and the survival and prognosis of all the groups with Kaplan-Meier and Log-Rank. RESULTS: 45 patients and cytogenetic studies and there were 18 cases with normal karyotypes and 27 cases with aberrant karyotypes. The detection rate of chromosomal abnormality was 60.0%. In the cases with chromosomal abnormality, there were 17 cases with multiple chromosomal abnormality and 10 cases with simple chromosomal abnormality. 10 cases had excess of hypodiploid or hyperdiploid. In 18.5% (5/27) of the cases with aberrant karyotypes 5 chromosomes were involved and in 25.9% (7/27) 7 or 8 chromosomes were involved. The 55 patients were followed up and their treatment response was evaluated. In these patients, total complete remission rate was 63.6%. Among them, the complete remission rate of acute erythroid leukemia with MDS history was lower than that without MDS history (42.8% vs 85.2%, P < 0.05). The complete remission rate of acute erythroid leukemia with aberrant karyotypes was lower than that with normal karyotypes (37.0% vs 83.3%, P < 0.01). The median follow-up was 30 months (3 - 79 months). During follow-up, the overall survival and disease-free survival of the patients with aberrant karyotypes or MDS history who received transplantation were longer than those who received chemotherapy (P < 0.01). Chromosomal abnormality and previous MDS history were the major factors that influenced prognosis. 16 patients received allogeneic haemopoietic stem cell transplantation. Among them, 9 cases had aberrant karyotypes and previous MDS history and 4 cases had no response to chemotherapy. After transplantation, 11 cases survived without any disease. The median survival was 28 months and 2-year survival 68.7% (11/16). CONCLUSIONS: Acute erythroid leukemia patients with aberrant karyotypes or MDS history are usually resistant to chemotherapy. The survival of these patients is short and the prognosis poor. Allogeneic haemopoietic stem cell transplantation could improve survival and prognosis. The patients with aberrant karyotypes or MDS history should receive allogeneic haemopoietic stem cell transplantation as early as possible.","['Liu, Jin', 'Lu, Dao-pei', 'Zhang, Yan']","['Liu J', 'Lu DP', 'Zhang Y']","[""Institute of Hematology, People's Hospital, Peking University, Beijing 100044, China.""]",['chi'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",,China,Zhonghua Nei Ke Za Zhi,Zhonghua nei ke za zhi,16210490R,,IM,"['Adult', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*diagnosis/*genetics/therapy', 'Male', 'Prognosis', 'Retrospective Studies']",,2006/12/15 09:00,2009/07/10 09:00,['2006/12/15 09:00'],"['2006/12/15 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/07/10 09:00 [medline]', '2006/12/15 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Zhonghua Nei Ke Za Zhi. 2006 Sep;45(9):738-40.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the rapid development of ATRA-resistance has become a problem in treating APL. Many researches indicate that the mechanism of ATRA-resistance is related to lack of some proteins synthesized by interferon (IFN). This study was to explore the possibility and the possible mechanism of treating ATRA-resistant APL with IFN in combination with ATRA. METHODS: Interferon-gamma (IFNgamma) alone or IFNgamma combined with ATRA was used to treat ATRA-sensitive cell line NB4 and ATRA-resistant cell line MR2. Cell proliferation was tested by MTT assay. Light microscope and NBT test were used to evaluate cell differentiation. The expression of promyelocytic leukemia (PML) protein was observed by indirect immune fluorescent method. RESULTS: On the 8th day, the growth inhibition rates of NB4 cells and MR2 cells were significantly higher in combination group than in IFNgamma group and ATRA group (95.2% vs. 68.0% and 85.0%, P<0.05; 51.5% vs. 24.1% and 4.3%, P<0.05). On the 3rd day, the positive rates of NBT in NB4 cells and MR2 cells were significantly higher in combination group than in IFNgamma group and ATRA group (93.3% vs. 19.3% and 74.7%, P<0.05; 31.5% vs. 16.8% and 5.2%, P<0.05). After treatment of IFNgamma, the fluorescent particles in NB4 and MR2 cell nuclei were obviously increased as compared with those in control group. CONCLUSION: IFNgamma and ATRA have synergistic inhibitory effect on the proliferation of NB4 cells and MR2 cells, and can partially induce the differentiation of ATRA-resistant MR2 cells.","['He, Peng-Cheng', 'Zhang, Mei', 'Wu, Di', 'Xu, Hui', 'Cai, Rui-Bo', 'Liu, Ya-Lin']","['He PC', 'Zhang M', 'Wu D', 'Xu H', 'Cai RB', 'Liu YL']","[""Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital, Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, Shaanxi, 710061, P.

They have been used to treat leukemia, but their effects on solid tumors remain unclear. This study was to investigate the effects of ATRA and 1,25(OH)2D3 on growth and cell cycle of human hepatoma cell line HepG2, and explore the molecular mechanism. METHODS: After HepG2 cells were treated with ATRA, 1,25(OH)2D3, or the combination of both chemicals, cell survival was assessed by MTT assay, morphologic changes were observed under light microscope, cell cycle and apoptosis were determined by flow cytometry (FCM) with dual staining of AnnexinV/PI, and the expression of p21(WAF/CIP1) and p27(KIP1) mRNA and protein were determined by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and FCM. RESULTS: ATRA and 1,25(OH)2D3, used alone or in combination, inhibited the growth of HepG2 cells in a time- and dose-dependent manner. The inhibition was more obvious in the combination group than in ATRA group and 1,25(OH)2D3 group (P<0.05). FCM analysis indicated that 10 nmol/L 1,25(OH)2D3, used alone or in combination with ATRA for 72 h, strongly induced G1 phase arrest of HepG2 cells [(54.27+/-3.69)% and (65.64+/-5.65)% vs. (40.40+/-1.91)% of the control, P<0.05], but 1 micromol/L ATRA did not show obvious effect. All of them induced apoptosis (P<0.05). The mRNA level of p21(WAF/CIP1) was enhanced by 35% and 56% of control in the cells treated with 10 nmol/L 1,25(OH)2D3 or 1,25(OH)2D3 combined with ATRA for 24 h. The combination of 1,25(OH)2D3 and ATRA markedly enhanced the protein levels of p21(WAF/CIP1) and p27(KIP1) as compared with 1,25(OH)2D3 alone, and 1 micromol/L ATRA did not enhance the protein levels of p21(WAF/CIP1) and p27(KIP1) in HepG2 cells. CONCLUSIONS: ATRA and 1,25(OH)2D3 could inhibit growth and induce apoptosis of HepG2 cells, and the molecular basis of the cell cycle blockade by 1,25(OH)2D3 may be associated with the up-regulation of CDK inhibitors p21(WAF/CIP1) and p27(KIP1), which mediate G1 arrest. Furthermore, the combination of ATRA and 1,25(OH)2D3 can exert synergistic inhibitory effect on the growth of HepG2 cells.","['Lu, Hang-Qing', 'Zheng, Jie']","['Lu HQ', 'Zheng J']","['Institute of Molecular Pathology, Department of Pathology and Pathophysiology, School of Basic Medical Science, Southeast University, Nanjing, Jiangsu, 210009, P.

Following intravenous challenge with transduced Ba/F3 clones and treatment with GCV, leukemia developed in mice given cells expressing HSV-TK, but not SR39 or sc39. In vitro GCV resistance was observed in heterogeneously transduced Ba/F3 pools at 2.5-14%, and single-nucleotide changes or partial loss of the suicide gene were identified as mechanisms of drug escape. However, GCV treatment resulted in 80-100% survival of mice challenged even with pools of partially resistant Ba/F3 cells expressing SR39 or sc39.

One of those sequences is that for the human IL-1 receptor antagonist protein (IL1RN). The RNA analysis showed that a cryptic splice acceptor sequence is present in the middle of its coding region, resulting in the deletion of the packaging signal sequence and the removal of some coding sequences that lead to low viral titer and a low level of the transgene product. We tested whether the mouse Hist2h2aa1 element (mH2aE), previously shown to suppress the splicing function, could inhibit the cryptic splicing in the context of MLV-based retroviral vectors. It was found that the mH2aE could efficiently suppress such unwanted splicing event, thus increasing the amount of unspliced transcript, which eventually led to the increase in the level of IL1RN expression and viral titer. The mH2aE could also be used to control unusually high splicing activity.

At the same time, retroviral mutagenesis in mice is being considered a powerful forward genetic strategy to identify disease genes involved in cancer. The publication of the mouse genome sequence and the development of high-throughput genomic approaches have given a further boost to this rapidly evolving field. The increasing numbers of new potential oncogenes identified in retroviral screens have given a valuable basis for a better understanding of cancer related pathways in mice. Important challenges that now lie ahead of us are (i) to determine the relevance and causal relationship of these genes with various types of human cancer (ii) to develop strategies to identify tumor suppressor genes on a large scale, (iii) to place the disease genes into regulatory networks to better understand their role in the complex pathogenesis of cancer, and (iv) to determine their value for diagnosis refinement and therapeutic target intervention in human disease.

The VEGF-C/VEGFR-3 axis is expressed not only by lymphatic endothelial cells but also by a variety of human tumour cells. Activation of the VEGF-C/VEGFR-3 axis in lymphatic endothelial cells can facilitate metastasis by increasing the formation of lymphatic vessels (lymphangiogenesis) within and around tumours. The VEGF-C/VEGFR-3 axis plays a critical role in leukaemic cell proliferation, survival, and resistance to chemotherapy. Moreover, activation of the VEGF-C/VEGFR-3 axis in several types of solid tumours enhances cancer cell mobility and invasion capabilities, promoting cancer cell metastasis. In this review, we discuss the novel function and molecular mechanism of the VEGF-C/VEGFR-3 axis in cancer progression.","['Su, J-L', 'Yen, C-J', 'Chen, P-S', 'Chuang, S-E', 'Hong, C-C', 'Kuo, I-H', 'Chen, H-Y', 'Hung, M-C', 'Kuo, M-L']","['Su JL', 'Yen CJ', 'Chen PS', 'Chuang SE', 'Hong CC', 'Kuo IH', 'Chen HY', 'Hung MC', 'Kuo ML']","['Institute of Medical Science, College of Medicine, China Medical University, Taichung 404, Taiwan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20061212,England,Br J Cancer,British journal of cancer,0370635,"['0 (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor C)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Receptor-3)']",IM,"['Disease Progression', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*pathology/*physiopathology', 'Lymphangiogenesis', 'Neoplasms/*pathology/*physiopathology', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor C/*metabolism', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Receptor-3/*metabolism']",48,2006/12/14 09:00,2007/09/14 09:00,['2006/12/14 09:00'],"['2006/12/14 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/09/14 09:00 [medline]', '2006/12/14 09:00 [entrez]']","['6603487 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.bjc.6603487 [doi]']",ppublish,Br J Cancer. 2007 Feb 26;96(4):541-5. doi: 10.1038/sj.bjc.6603487.

It is now well established that interindividual variation in sensitivity to thiopurines can be the result of the presence of genetic polymorphisms in the TPMT gene. The aim of this study was to determine the frequency and type of TPMT polymorphisms in the population of Serbia and Montenegro and to assess its relevance in the management of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Blood samples from 100 healthy adults and 100 children with ALL were analyzed for common mutations in the TPMT gene using polymerase chain reaction-based assays. The results revealed that allelic frequencies were 0.2% for TPMT*2, 3.2% for TPMT*3A, and 0.5% for TPMT*3B. A rare TPMT*3B allele was detected in 2 families. No TPMT*3C allele was found. The general pattern of TPMT-variant allele distribution as well as their frequencies in the population of Serbia and Montenegro, is similar to those determined for other Slavic and Mediterranean populations. The ability to tolerate 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP) -based maintenance therapy was used as a surrogate marker of hematologic toxicity. In the study of 50 patients with childhood ALL treated according to the BFM-like protocol, it was found that even TPMT-heterozygous patients are at greater risk of thiopurine drug-related leukopenia (mean duration of period when children missed therapy as a result of leukopenia for TPMT-heterozygous patients was 11.3 weeks vs 3.4 weeks for wild-type genotype patients, P < 0.01). In another group of 50 patients, the TPMT genotype was determined prospectively. The therapy protocol was modified considering their TPMT genotype. Administering reduced 6-MP dosages in the initial phase of maintenance allowed TPMT-heterozygous patients to later receive full protocol doses of both 6-MP and nonthiopurine therapy without omitting therapy resulting from myelotoxicity. These results justify performing TPMT genotyping before initiating thiopurine therapy in all children with ALL to minimize consequent toxicity.","['Dokmanovic, Lidija', 'Urosevic, Jelena', 'Janic, Dragana', 'Jovanovic, Nada', 'Petrucev, Branka', 'Tosic, Natasa', 'Pavlovic, Sonja']","['Dokmanovic L', 'Urosevic J', 'Janic D', 'Jovanovic N', 'Petrucev B', 'Tosic N', 'Pavlovic S']","[""Department of Hematology and Oncology, University Children's Hospital, Belgrade, Serbia, and Montenegro.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Ther Drug Monit,Therapeutic drug monitoring,7909660,"['E7WED276I5 (Mercaptopurine)', 'EC 2.1.1.- (Methyltransferases)', 'EC 2.1.1.67 (thiopurine methyltransferase)']",IM,"['Child', 'Drug Tolerance', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Mercaptopurine/*therapeutic use', 'Methyltransferases/*genetics', '*Polymorphism, Genetic', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/*enzymology/*genetics', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Yugoslavia']",,2006/12/14 09:00,2007/02/28 09:00,['2006/12/14 09:00'],"['2006/12/14 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/02/28 09:00 [medline]', '2006/12/14 09:00 [entrez]']","['10.1097/01.ftd.0000249947.17676.92 [doi]', '00007691-200612000-00012 [pii]']",ppublish,Ther Drug Monit. 2006 Dec;28(6):800-6. doi: 10.1097/01.ftd.0000249947.17676.92.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

CASE SUMMARY: A 56-year-old female with acute myelogenous leukemia in remission developed Pneumocystis carinii infection. Treatment was initiated with trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX), but the patient subsequently developed a rash on day 10 of treatment. TMP/SMX was discontinued and intravenous pentamidine was started in order to complete a 21 day treatment course for P. carinii pneumonia (PCP). However, on day 3 of pentamidine treatment, the patient reported perioral numbness during the infusion. The numbness disappeared soon after completion of the infusion but recurred with all subsequent pentamidine infusions. DISCUSSION: Paresthesias in general and facial area numbness in particular have been reported with pentamidine administration. While it is possible such adverse events may be a result of pentamidine's effect on serum electrolytes and glucose, especially hypocalcemia and hypoglycemia, these laboratory values were not grossly affected by pentamidine in our patient. The Naranjo probability scale revealed a probable adverse reaction of perioral numbness associated with intravenous pentamidine. CONCLUSIONS: Pentamidine is considered an alternative agent to TMP/SMX in the treatment of PCP. Although they do not commonly occur, paresthesias have been reported with pentamidine therapy.

Recent studies have shown that genomic DNA (gDNA) suitable for SNP genotyping can be obtained from buccal cells and from dried blood spots on Guthrie cards. Further, successful SNP genotyping has been done using the reaction product of multiple displacement amplification of gDNA. We evaluated genotype consistency on the Illumina genotyping platform for 717 to 1,744 SNP loci between replicate samples of gDNA and whole genome amplified DNA (wgaDNA) from a variety of sources. Nine healthy adults provided peripheral blood via venipuncture and buccal cells by mouth rinse. DNA was also obtained from urothelial cells in urine samples from five of the nine subjects. gDNA was extracted from all samples, wgaDNA was generated from each gDNA, and all samples were genotyped. To assess SNP genotyping accuracy of DNA obtained from dried blood spots, gDNA was extracted, amplified, and genotyped from peripheral blood samples and paired Guthrie card samples were obtained from eight childhood leukemia patients. Call rates and replicate concordances for all sample types, regardless of amplification, were >97%, with most sample types having call rates and replicate concordances >99%. Using the gDNA from blood samples as the reference for concordances calculated for all other sample types, we observed concordances >98% regardless of sample type or amplification. We conclude that highly multiplexed Illumina genotyping may be done on gDNA and wgaDNA obtained from whole blood, buccal samples, dried blood spots on Guthrie cards, and possibly even urine samples, with minimal misclassification.","['Paynter, Randi A', 'Skibola, Danica R', 'Skibola, Christine F', 'Buffler, Patricia A', 'Wiemels, Joseph L', 'Smith, Martyn T']","['Paynter RA', 'Skibola DR', 'Skibola CF', 'Buffler PA', 'Wiemels JL', 'Smith MT']","['Division of Environmental Health Sciences, School of Public Health, University of California, 140 Earl Warren Hall #7360, Berkeley, CA 94720-7360, USA. randi@post.harvard.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",,United States,Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev,"Cancer epidemiology, biomarkers & prevention : a publication of the American Association for Cancer Research, cosponsored by the American Society of Preventive Oncology",9200608,['9007-49-2 (DNA)'],IM,"['Aged', 'DNA/*analysis/blood/urine', 'Genome/*genetics', 'Genotype', 'Humans', 'Nucleic Acid Amplification Techniques', '*Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide', 'Reproducibility of Results']",,2006/12/14 09:00,2007/04/10 09:00,['2006/12/14 09:00'],"['2006/12/14 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/04/10 09:00 [medline]', '2006/12/14 09:00 [entrez]']","['15/12/2533 [pii]', '10.1158/1055-9965.EPI-06-0219 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev. 2006 Dec;15(12):2533-6. doi: 10.1158/1055-9965.EPI-06-0219.,,,,,,,"['R01CA104682/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01ES009137/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States', 'P42 ES004705/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01CA089032/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P42ES004705/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,

No study has evaluated the association of NHL with postload plasma glucose (PLG) levels, which are positively associated with BMI. We analyzed data from a cohort study to investigate associations of interviewer-measured BMI and PLG with risk of NHL mortality and to explore associations with leukemia and multiple myeloma. METHODS: Employees of 84 Chicago-area organizations, with an average age of 40 years at baseline, were screened from 1967 to 1973. Height and weight were measured by study nurses. A 50-g oral glucose load was administered to nondiabetic participants. Of the at-risk cohort of 35,420 men and women, 129 died of NHL, 151 died of leukemia, and 66 died of multiple myeloma during an average of 31 years of follow-up. Hazard Ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) were derived from Cox proportional hazards regression models. RESULTS: Among men, there were positive dose-response relations of BMI with mortality from NHL (HR, 2.57; 95% CI, 1.24-5.34 for the highest versus lowest quartile; P(trend) = 0.01) and leukemia (HR, 1.98; 1.07-3.69; P(trend) = 0.02). PLG also was positively related to NHL mortality (HR, 2.86; 95% CI, 1.35-6.06 for the highest versus lowest category; P(trend) = 0.004). For women, a higher BMI was positively associated with leukemia mortality (HR, 2.47; 95% CI, 0.96-6.36; P(trend) = 0.02) and the highest level of PLG was associated with risk of mortality from multiple myeloma (HR, 3.06; 95% CI, 1.05-8.93). The risk estimates for BMI and PLG remained unchanged after adjustment for each factor. CONCLUSIONS: High BMI and/or abnormal PLG is associated with higher risk of mortality from NHL and possibly leukemia and from myeloma in women. These findings might have public health significance because BMI and glucose levels are amenable to modification.","['Chiu, Brian C-H', 'Gapstur, Susan M', 'Greenland, Philip', 'Wang, Renwei', 'Dyer, Alan']","['Chiu BC', 'Gapstur SM', 'Greenland P', 'Wang R', 'Dyer A']","['Department of Preventive Medicine, Feinberg School of Medicine, Northwestern University, 680 North Lake Shore Drive, Suite 1102, Chicago, IL 60611-4402, USA. bchiu@northwestern.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev,"Cancer epidemiology, biomarkers & prevention : a publication of the American Association for Cancer Research, cosponsored by the American Society of Preventive Oncology",9200608,['0 (Blood Glucose)'],IM,"['Adult', 'Blood Glucose/metabolism', 'Body Mass Index', 'Female', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*metabolism/mortality', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/metabolism/mortality', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/*metabolism/mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multiple Myeloma/metabolism/mortality', 'Prospective Studies', 'Risk Factors']",,2006/12/14 09:00,2007/04/10 09:00,['2006/12/14 09:00'],"['2006/12/14 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/04/10 09:00 [medline]', '2006/12/14 09:00 [entrez]']","['15/12/2348 [pii]', '10.1158/1055-9965.EPI-06-0007 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev. 2006 Dec;15(12):2348-54. doi: 10.1158/1055-9965.EPI-06-0007.,,,,,,,"['R01-HL 03387/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01-HL 15174/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01-HL 21010/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,

To test the potential role of intrauterine and perinatal factors linked to the risk of IAL development, a hospital-based case-control study was conducted in different cities of Brazil. A total of 202 children (ages 0-21 months) with newly diagnosed IAL was enrolled (1999-2005), and 440 age-matched controls were selected from the same hospitals wherein IAL cases were treated.

Therefore, a mechanism must exist to prevent proteins destined to recycling or to the trans-Golgi network (TGN) from reaching the SGs. We now show that synaptotagmin (Syt) IX, a Syt homologue that is required for recycling from the endocytic recycling compartment (ERC) in rat basophilic leukemia (RBL-2H3) cultured mast cells, is involved in segregating recycling proteins from the SGs. By using as a marker the recycling protein TGN38, which cycles between the TGN, plasma membrane, and the ERC, we show that knock-down of Syt IX results in mistargeting of HA-tagged TGN38 to the SGs. We further demonstrate that Syt IX binds directly the small GTPase ARF1 and associates with the clathrin adaptor complex AP-1. These results therefore implicate Syt IX as an essential factor for the correct sorting of SGs proteins. Moreover, they place Syt IX as part of the machinery that is involved in the formation of transport carriers that mediate SGs protein sorting.","['Haberman, Yael', 'Ziv, Idit', 'Gorzalczany, Yaara', 'Hirschberg, Koret', 'Mittleman, Leonide', 'Fukuda, Mitsunori', 'Sagi-Eisenberg, Ronit']","['Haberman Y', 'Ziv I', 'Gorzalczany Y', 'Hirschberg K', 'Mittleman L', 'Fukuda M', 'Sagi-Eisenberg R']","['Department of Cell and Developmental Biology, Sackler School of Medicine, Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv 69978, Israel.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20061212,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Adaptor Protein Complex 1)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Msln protein, rat)', '0 (Tgoln2 protein, rat)', '134193-27-4 (Synaptotagmins)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (ADP-Ribosylation Factor 1)', 'J27WDC343N (Mesothelin)']",IM,"['ADP-Ribosylation Factor 1/metabolism', 'Adaptor Protein Complex 1/metabolism', 'Animals', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Endocytosis/*physiology', 'Golgi Apparatus/*metabolism', 'Mast Cells/*metabolism', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/metabolism', 'Mesothelin', 'Protein Transport/physiology', 'Rats', 'Secretory Vesicles/*metabolism', 'Synaptotagmins/*metabolism']",,2006/12/14 09:00,2007/05/24 09:00,['2006/12/14 09:00'],"['2006/12/14 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/05/24 09:00 [medline]', '2006/12/14 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)41714-8 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2006-07-033126 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2007 Apr 15;109(8):3385-92. doi: 10.1182/blood-2006-07-033126.

Here, we show that IDO expression correlates with increased circulating CD4+CD25+FOXP3+ T cells in patients with AML at diagnosis. In vitro, IDO+ AML cells increase the number of CD4+ CD25+ T cells expressing surface CTLA-4 and FOXP3 mRNA, and this effect is completely abrogated by the IDO inhibitor, 1-methyl tryptophan (1-MT). Purified CD4+CD25+ T cells obtained from coculture with IDO+ AML cells act as T regulatory (T(reg)) cells because they do not proliferate, do not produce interleukin (IL)-2, and inhibit naive T-cell proliferation. Coculture with IDO+AML cells results in the conversion of CD4+CD25- into CD4+CD25+ T cells, which is completely abrogated by 1-MT. Moreover, in mice, intrasplenic injection of IDO+ leukemia/ lymphoma A20 cells induces the expansion of bona fide T(reg) cells by conversion of CD4+CD25- T cells; this effect is counteracted by 1-MT treatment.

In patients with chronic myeloid leukemia treated with ABL inhibitors, BCR-ABL kinase domain mutations are the principal mechanism of relapse. Certain mutations are occasionally detected before treatment, suggesting increased fitness relative to wild-type p210 BCR-ABL. We evaluated the oncogenicity of eight kinase inhibitor-resistant BCR-ABL mutants and found a spectrum of potencies greater or less than p210. Although most fitness alterations correlate with changes in kinase activity, this is not the case with the T315I BCR-ABL mutation that confers clinical resistance to all currently approved ABL kinase inhibitors. Through global phosphoproteome analysis, we identified a unique phosphosubstrate signature associated with each drug-resistant allele, including a shift in phosphorylation of two tyrosines (Tyr253 and Tyr257) in the ATP binding loop (P-loop) of BCR-ABL when Thr315 is Ile or Ala. Mutational analysis of these tyrosines in the context of Thr315 mutations demonstrates that the identity of the gatekeeper residue impacts oncogenicity by altered P-loop phosphorylation. Therefore, mutations that confer clinical resistance to kinase inhibitors can substantially alter kinase function and confer novel biological properties that may impact disease progression.","['Skaggs, Brian J', 'Gorre, Mercedes E', 'Ryvkin, Ann', 'Burgess, Michael R', 'Xie, Yongming', 'Han, Yun', 'Komisopoulou, Evangelia', 'Brown, Lauren M', 'Loo, Joseph A', 'Landaw, Elliot M', 'Sawyers, Charles L', 'Graeber, Thomas G']","['Skaggs BJ', 'Gorre ME', 'Ryvkin A', 'Burgess MR', 'Xie Y', 'Han Y', 'Komisopoulou E', 'Brown LM', 'Loo JA', 'Landaw EM', 'Sawyers CL', 'Graeber TG']","['Howard Hughes Medical Institute, University of California, Los Angeles, CA 90095, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20061212,United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '8L70Q75FXE (Adenosine Triphosphate)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Adenosine Triphosphate/metabolism', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Cell Line', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*genetics', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Mass Spectrometry', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutation, Missense/genetics', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/metabolism', 'Proteomics']",,2006/12/14 09:00,2007/03/03 09:00,['2006/12/14 09:00'],"['2006/12/14 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/03/03 09:00 [medline]', '2006/12/14 09:00 [entrez]']","['0609239103 [pii]', '10.1073/pnas.0609239103 [doi]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2006 Dec 19;103(51):19466-71. doi: 10.1073/pnas.0609239103.

Previous studies identified a proline-rich domain in the cytoplasmic tail required for sorting FasL to secretory lysosomes, but the mechanisms by which this occurs have not been identified. Here we demonstrate that the PRD of FasL binds Fgr, Fyn and Lyn tyrosine kinases, leading to phosphorylation of FasL. Loss of phosphorylation reduces internalisation of FasL into multivesicular bodies. FasL is also directly mono-ubiquitylated at lysines flanking the PRD and mutation of these lysines reduces MVB localisation of FasL. Phosphorylation is not required for ubiquitylation because FasL lacking all tyrosines undergoes mono-ubiquitylation. These studies show that phosphorylation and ubiquitin signals regulate the sorting of FasL to secretory lysosomes by controlling entry into multivesicular bodies.","['Zuccato, Elisabetta', 'Blott, Emma J', 'Holt, Oliver', 'Sigismund, Sara', 'Shaw, Michael', 'Bossi, Giovanna', 'Griffiths, Gillian M']","['Zuccato E', 'Blott EJ', 'Holt O', 'Sigismund S', 'Shaw M', 'Bossi G', 'Griffiths GM']","['Sir William Dunn School of Pathology, South Parks Rd, Oxford, OX1 3RE, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20061212,England,J Cell Sci,Journal of cell science,0052457,"['0 (Fas Ligand Protein)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Ubiquitin)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (FYN protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Lymphocyte Specific Protein Tyrosine Kinase p56(lck))', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-fyn)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (lyn protein-tyrosine kinase)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (proto-oncogene proteins c-fgr)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (src-Family Kinases)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Endosomes/metabolism', 'Fas Ligand Protein/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Leukemia, Basophilic, Acute', 'Lymphocyte Specific Protein Tyrosine Kinase p56(lck)/chemistry/genetics/metabolism', 'Lysosomes/*metabolism', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Protein Transport/*physiology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/chemistry/genetics/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-fyn/chemistry/genetics/metabolism', 'Rats', 'Secretory Vesicles/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/physiology', 'Ubiquitin/*metabolism', 'src Homology Domains/physiology', 'src-Family Kinases/chemistry/genetics/metabolism']",,2006/12/14 09:00,2007/04/05 09:00,['2006/12/14 09:00'],"['2006/12/14 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/04/05 09:00 [medline]', '2006/12/14 09:00 [entrez]']","['jcs.03315 [pii]', '10.1242/jcs.03315 [doi]']",ppublish,J Cell Sci. 2007 Jan 1;120(Pt 1):191-9. doi: 10.1242/jcs.03315.

Significantly enhanced radiosensitivity and growth suppression were observed. G(2) accumulation was obtained. Radiation-induced apoptosis of HL-60 cells was significantly inhibited by TP53, indicating that, in the event of DNA damage, TP53 is able to prevent cell death of HL-60 leukaemia cells by sustaining an arrest of the cell cycle at G(2) phase.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: We analyzed the outcome, cost and cost-effectiveness of 106 patients treated from January 1994 to January 2002 [94 acute myelogenous leukemia (AML)/12 acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL)]. Forty-two young patients at either intermediate or unknown cytogenetic risk received postremission intensive therapy (24 HiDAC-based/18 alloSCT-based therapy). RESULTS: After a median follow-up of 50 months, the estimated 7-year overall survival for the HiDAC-based group showed a tendency to be higher than the alloSCT-based group (48% versus 28%, P = 0.1452). The HiDAC-based group spent a significantly lower total cost ($US51,857 versus 75,474, P = 0.004) than the alloSCT-based group. Cost-effectiveness analysis showed that the mean cost per year of life saved for the HiDAC-based group is considerably less expensive than the alloSCT-based group ($US11,224 versus 21,564). The reduced total cost for the HiDAC-based group originated from lower cost in room fees, medication, laboratory and procedure, but not in blood transfusion and professional manpower fees. CONCLUSION: For the postremission therapy in young AML patients at either intermediate or unknown cytogenetic risk, cost-effectiveness of HiDAC-based therapy compares favorably with that of alloSCT-based therapy, which deserves further clinical trials.","['Yu, Y-B', 'Gau, J-P', 'You, J-Y', 'Chern, H-H', 'Chau, W-K', 'Tzeng, C-H', 'Ho, C-H', 'Hsu, H-C']","['Yu YB', 'Gau JP', 'You JY', 'Chern HH', 'Chau WK', 'Tzeng CH', 'Ho CH', 'Hsu HC']","['Division of Hematology and Oncology, Department of Medicine, Taipei-Veterans General Hospital, Taiwan 11217, Republic of China.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20061212,England,Ann Oncol,Annals of oncology : official journal of the European Society for Medical Oncology,9007735,['0 (Arabinonucleosides)'],IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*economics/therapeutic use', 'Arabinonucleosides/administration & dosage', 'Cost-Benefit Analysis', 'Drug Costs', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Health Care Costs', 'Humans', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/*economics/mortality/surgery', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/*economics/mortality/surgery', 'Stem Cell Transplantation/*economics', 'Taiwan', 'Time Factors', 'Transplantation, Autologous/economics', 'Transplantation, Homologous/economics', 'Treatment Outcome']",,2006/12/14 09:00,2007/08/11 09:00,['2006/12/14 09:00'],"['2006/12/14 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/08/11 09:00 [medline]', '2006/12/14 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0923-7534(19)37826-3 [pii]', '10.1093/annonc/mdl420 [doi]']",ppublish,Ann Oncol. 2007 Mar;18(3):529-34. doi: 10.1093/annonc/mdl420.

Although these measures improve quality of life, their impact on the natural history of the disease is questionable. Recently, three new agents have been approved for the treatment of MDS. These include: 5-azacytidine, lenalidomide and, more recently, 5-aza-2 -deoxycytidine (decitabine). Decitabine is a hypomethylating agent that is incorporated into DNA and forms irreversible covalent adducts with DNA-methyltransferases. At high concentrations, this leads to cell death. At low concentrations, decitabine is considered to exert its anticancer effects by inducing DNA hypomethylation. This results in reactivation of epigenetically repressed genes, such as tumour suppressor genes and, potentially, cell differentiation. In a randomized, Phase III trial of decitabine versus best supportive care in patients with MDS, the overall response rate with decitabine was 17%, including 9% complete remissions. Patients at high risk had a statistically significant prolongation of time to acute myelogenous leukemia transformation or death. This experience has been followed by a study of low-dose decitabine using a five-times daily 1-h infusion schedule, with significant efficacy in patients with MDS observed. Ongoing studies are evaluating the activity and safety of the combination of decitabine with several histone deacetylase inhibitors and other indications. This article summarizes the experience in with decitabine in MDS.","['Atallah, Ehab', 'Kantarjian, Hagop', 'Garcia-Manero, Guillermo']","['Atallah E', 'Kantarjian H', 'Garcia-Manero G']","['Department of Leukemia, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,England,Expert Opin Pharmacother,Expert opinion on pharmacotherapy,100897346,"['776B62CQ27 (Decitabine)', 'M801H13NRU (Azacitidine)']",IM,"['Azacitidine/*analogs & derivatives/chemistry/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Clinical Trials, Phase III as Topic', 'DNA Methylation/drug effects', 'Decitabine', 'Drug Therapy, Combination', 'Humans', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*drug therapy/epidemiology']",61,2006/12/14 09:00,2007/02/23 09:00,['2006/12/14 09:00'],"['2006/12/14 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/02/23 09:00 [medline]', '2006/12/14 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1517/14656566.8.1.65 [doi]'],ppublish,Expert Opin Pharmacother. 2007 Jan;8(1):65-73. doi: 10.1517/14656566.8.1.65.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

When K562 cells were incubated with matrine in higher than 0.2 mg/ml doses for 48 hours, the apoptotic cells were increased and both poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) and caspase-3 were cleaved in a dose dependent manner. General caspase inhibitor (z-VAD-fmk) or caspase-3 inhibitor (z-DEVD-fmk) almost completely suppressed matrine-induced apoptosis. In addition, matrine increased proapoptotic protein bax and caused the release of cytochrome C. Taken together, the results suggest that matrine induces a cytochrome C-mediated, caspase-dependent apoptosis.","['Liu, Xiao-Shan', 'Jiang, Jikai']","['Liu XS', 'Jiang J']","['Center for Molecular Biology, School of Medicine, Shantou University, Shantou, Guangdong, 515031, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Singapore,Am J Chin Med,The American journal of Chinese medicine,7901431,"['0 (Alkaloids)', '0 (Amino Acid Chloromethyl Ketones)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Caspase Inhibitors)', '0 (Cysteine Proteinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Oligopeptides)', '0 (Quinolizines)', '0 (benzoylcarbonyl-aspartyl-glutamyl-valyl-aspartyl-fluoromethyl ketone)', '0 (benzyloxycarbonylvalyl-alanyl-aspartyl fluoromethyl ketone)', '9007-43-6 (Cytochromes c)', 'EC 2.4.2.30 (Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'N390W430AC (matrine)']",IM,"['Alkaloids/*pharmacology', 'Amino Acid Chloromethyl Ketones/pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Caspase 3/metabolism', 'Caspase Inhibitors', 'Cysteine Proteinase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Cytochromes c/metabolism', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Oligopeptides/pharmacology', 'Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases/metabolism', 'Quinolizines/*pharmacology']",,2006/12/14 09:00,2007/04/04 09:00,['2006/12/14 09:00'],"['2006/12/14 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/04/04 09:00 [medline]', '2006/12/14 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0192415X06004557 [pii]', '10.1142/S0192415X06004557 [doi]']",ppublish,Am J Chin Med. 2006;34(6):1095-103. doi: 10.1142/S0192415X06004557.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Thrombocytosis, thrombocytopenia, polycythemia, neutrophilia, transient myeloproliferative disorder (TMD), and congenital leukemia have all been reported. The two largest case series previously reported involved 63 and 31 cases. To acquire hematological data from a larger case series, we obtained all CBCs done during the first week after birth on all neonates with Down syndrome cared for in an Intermountain Healthcare (IHC) hospital with a date of birth between January 1, 2001 and December 31, 2005. During this period, 145,522 live births were recorded at 18 hospitals. Down syndrome was recognized in 226 (1 in 644). One hundred fifty-eight (70%) of these had one or more CBCs obtained before the seventh day (144 hr). Neonates who did versus did not have a CBC in the first week had a similar gestational age, birth weight, percentage who were LGA and SGA, and length of stay. Neutrophilia was the most common hematological abnormality detected, with 80% of absolute neutrophil counts above the upper limit of normal for age. Six percent (9/158) had blasts identified on the blood film and three, where this was persistent, were referred to the pediatric hematology service for further evaluation. The next most commonly detected abnormality was thrombocytopenia, with 66% of platelet counts <150,000/microl, and with 6% of counts <50,000/microl. The mean platelet volume did not correlate with the platelet count, but tended to run slightly large (9.2 +/- 1.3 fl), with 24% of values above 10 fl. Only one had a platelet transfusion. Polycythemia was the next most common hematological abnormality detected, with 33% of hematocrit values above 65% or hemoglobin concentrations above 22 g/dl. Six had a reduction transfusion. One patient had significant anemia (hematocrit <15%) and received an erythrocyte transfusion. One had neutropenia associated with an infection after bowel surgery. Neutrophilia, thrombocytopenia, and polycythemia were the most common hematological abnormalities observed among neonates with Down syndrome. Anemia, thrombocytosis, and neutropenia were not more common than among neonates who do not have Down syndrome.

In this study, we examine the kinetics and mechanism of Rac and Cdc42 activation in the rat basophilic leukemia RBL-2H3 cells. The activation kinetics of both Rac and Cdc42 show a biphasic profile, consisting of an early transient peak at 1 min and a late sustained activation phase at 20-40 min. The inhibition of phospholipase C (PLC)gamma causes a twofold increase in Rac and Cdc42 activation that coincides with a dramatic production of atypical filopodia-like structures. Inhibition of protein kinase C using bisindolylmaleimide mimics the effect of PLCgamma inhibition on Rac activation, but not on Cdc42 activation. In contrast, depletion of intracellular calcium leads to a complete inhibition of the early activation peak of both Rac and Cdc42, without significant effects on the late sustained activation.

Therefore, we took advantage of these features to develop an experimental approach by selectively exposing cancer cells to an oxidant insult induced by the combination of menadione (vitamin K(3)) and ascorbate (vitamin C). Ascorbate enhances the menadione redox cycling, increases the formation of reactive oxygen species and kills K562 cells as shown by more than 65% of LDH leakage after 24 hr of incubation. Since both lactate formation and ATP content are depressed by about 80% following ascorbate/menadione exposure, we suggest that the major intracellular event involved in such a cytotoxicity is related to the impairment of glycolysis. Indeed, NAD(+) is rapidly and severely depleted, a fact most probably related to a strong Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) activation, as shown by the high amount of poly-ADP-ribosylated proteins. The addition of N-acetylcysteine (NAC) restores most of the ATP content and the production of lactate as well. The PARP inhibitor dihydroxyisoquinoline (DiQ) was able to partially restore both parameters as well as cell death induced by ascorbate/menadione. These results suggest that the PARP activation induced by the oxidative stress is a major but not the only intracellular event involved in cell death by ascorbate/menadione. Due to the high energetic dependence of cancer cells on glycolysis, the impairment of such an essential pathway may explain the effectiveness of this combination to kill cancer cells.","['Verrax, Julien', 'Vanbever, Stephanie', 'Stockis, Julie', 'Taper, Henryk', 'Calderon, Pedro Buc']","['Verrax J', 'Vanbever S', 'Stockis J', 'Taper H', 'Calderon PB']","['Unite de Pharmacocinetique, Metabolisme, Nutrition et Toxicologie, Departement des sciences pharmaceutiques, Universite Catholique de Louvain, Belgium.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,"['0 (Antioxidants)', '0U46U6E8UK (NAD)', '723JX6CXY5 (Vitamin K 3)', 'EC 2.4.2.30 (Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases)', 'PQ6CK8PD0R (Ascorbic Acid)']",IM,"['Antioxidants/*pharmacology', '*Apoptosis', 'Ascorbic Acid/*pharmacology', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Glycolysis/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*enzymology/metabolism', 'NAD/deficiency', 'Necrosis', 'Oxidative Stress', 'Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases/*metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Vitamin K 3/*pharmacology']",,2006/12/14 09:00,2007/04/25 09:00,['2006/12/14 09:00'],"['2006/12/14 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/04/25 09:00 [medline]', '2006/12/14 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ijc.22439 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Cancer. 2007 Mar 15;120(6):1192-7. doi: 10.1002/ijc.22439.,,,,,,"['(c) 2006 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

As a consequence, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices has recommended initiating influenza immunization of children as young as 6 months of age through 23 months of age and, recently, up to 5 years of age. However, immunization of older children has not yet become a priority of the US Public Health Service. As a consequence, the importance of antiviral agents, particularly neuraminidase (NA) inhibitors, cannot be overemphasized. From an epidemiological perspective, influenza resulted in higher childhood mortality than did Bordetella pertussis infection in 2003-2004. During that season, 153 children died of influenza, and two-thirds were <5 years of age. Importantly, nearly 50% of these children were previously healthy, with no underlying illness. Currently, 2 NA inhibitors are approved for the treatment of influenza in children. Zanamivir is approved for children >7 years of age, and oseltamivir is approved for children >1 year of age. Arguably, the younger children are at particular risk for influenza complications and hospitalization. In placebo-controlled studies in children >1 year of age, oseltamivir therapy accelerated resolution of clinical illness and defervescence and decreased both the incidence of otitis media and the concomitant use of antibiotics. However, oseltamivir is not currently approved for children <1 year of age. Three clinical toxicology studies identified neurotoxicity in newborn rats administered this medication. In these preclinical toxicology studies, the dose of oseltamivir exceeded that which would be used in humans. In addition, the metabolism of oseltamivir is different in rats than in humans. A key component of influenza therapy is the possibility for development of resistance. Although in studies performed in North America, resistance was not a frequent event, it has been documented in Japanese children treated with this medication; the adequacy of the dose used has been questioned. Children represent only one unique study population among others. Individuals who are at increased risk for influenza infection include the elderly, the immunocompromised, and pregnant women. Collectively, antiviral medications must be evaluated in populations in which they have not yet been assessed. The development of additional antiviral drugs is an important recommendation for the future, so that antiviral resistance can be circumvented. Similarly, availability of drugs for children <1 year of age is mandatory.","['Whitley, Richard J', 'Monto, Arnold S']","['Whitley RJ', 'Monto AS']","['University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, AL, 35233-1711, USA. rwhitley@peds.uab.edu']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,J Infect Dis,The Journal of infectious diseases,0413675,"['0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Influenza Vaccines)', '20O93L6F9H (Oseltamivir)', 'L6O3XI777I (Zanamivir)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Animals', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Disease Outbreaks/prevention & control', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/administration & dosage', 'Female', 'Homes for the Aged', 'Humans', 'Immunocompromised Host/immunology', 'Infant', 'Influenza Vaccines/*administration & dosage', 'Influenza, Human/*drug therapy/*prevention & control', 'Leukemia/immunology', 'Middle Aged', 'Nursing Homes', 'Oseltamivir/administration & dosage/toxicity', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Complications, Infectious/*prevention & control', 'Rats', 'Risk', 'United States/epidemiology', '*Vaccination', 'Zanamivir/administration & dosage']",,2006/12/14 09:00,2007/04/06 09:00,['2006/12/14 09:00'],"['2006/12/14 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/04/06 09:00 [medline]', '2006/12/14 09:00 [entrez]']","['JID36713 [pii]', '10.1086/507548 [doi]']",ppublish,J Infect Dis. 2006 Nov 1;194 Suppl 2:S133-8. doi: 10.1086/507548.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Mechanisms of pediatric acute leukemia induction include hyperdiploidy, aberrant expression of proto-oncogenes, and activation of transcription factors or kinases by aberrant fusion genes. Molecular analysis of these alterations has facilitated the recognition of distinct groups with different sensitivity to therapy, and identified potential targets for antileukemic agents. Similar analysis of pediatric soft tissue and bone tumors also resulted in the identification of specific fusion genes, and their characterization has contributed greatly to understand their biology. Molecular assays for these rearrangements have become important tools in classifying these tumors, providing important prognostic data. However, the understanding of mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of many other pediatric malignancies, including some embryonal tumors--believed to arise due to perturbation of the normal developmental program--is still vastly incomplete. The Department of Pathology at Texas Children's Hospital is one of the Children's Oncology Group (COG) reference centers for pediatric liver tumors. We have been particularly interested in the biology of hepatoblastoma, the most common type of pediatric liver tumor. Although a number of cytogenetic and molecular abnormalities have been described for this type of embryonal tumor, its pathogenesis is still poorly understood. In an attempt to explore the role of different signaling pathways in this disease, we analyzed the expression patterns of different histologic subtypes of hepatoblastoma using cDNA microarray analysis, qualitative reverse transcription, polymerase chain reaction (QRT-PCR), and immunohistochemistry. Wnt signaling pathway, critical both in development and in neoplasia, appears to be particularly relevant in these tumors. Mutations of the beta-catenin gene are present in over 90% of hepatoblastomas, leading to activating transcription of a number of target genes. The pattern of beta-catenin expression and type of mutation in groups of tumors are crucial to understand the corresponding differences in their gene expression profiles. Our findings are consistent with a relationship between poor histologic phenotype and beta-catenin activation, indicating the potential utility of targeted gene expression assays to identify molecular events related to the pathogenesis and prognosis of hepatoblastomas. Integration of clinical, morphologic, phenotypic, cytogenetic, and molecular data has become the basis of novel prognostic prediction and therapeutic strategies in pediatric leukemia. Similarly, integration of new genetic and molecular data with clinical, and other diagnostic information will be crucial for accurate classification of pediatric tumors, risk stratification, and successful development of new therapies for pediatric oncologic patients.","['Lopez-Terrada, Dolores']",['Lopez-Terrada D'],"[""Texas Children's Hospital, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,Adv Exp Med Biol,Advances in experimental medicine and biology,0121103,,IM,"['Child', '*Genetic Testing', 'Humans', 'Neoplasms/*diagnosis/epidemiology/*genetics', 'Risk Factors']",77,2006/12/14 09:00,2007/01/05 09:00,['2006/12/14 09:00'],"['2006/12/14 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/01/05 09:00 [medline]', '2006/12/14 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/978-1-4020-5133-3_12 [doi]'],ppublish,Adv Exp Med Biol. 2006;587:121-37. doi: 10.1007/978-1-4020-5133-3_12.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To support these goals, population-level data were used to examine trends in childhood cancer incidence among children aged 0-14 years in Wisconsin from 1980 to 1999. METHODS: Data for Wisconsin was provided by the Wisconsin Cancer Reporting System and compared to national data. Annual age-adjusted childhood cancer incidence rates for the entire population and subgroups by age, sex, race, time period, diagnostic code, and geographic region were described. Correlational analysis was conducted to assess the relation between community socioeconomic status and childhood cancer incidence using census data. RESULTS: Overall, Wisconsin's annual incidence rate for childhood cancers was 14.4 cases per 100,000 children aged 0-14 years during 1980-1999. This rate increased 10.9% (95% confidence interval 1-22%) between 1980 and 1999. Children in the 0-4 age group (20.9 per 100,000 per year) had the highest incidence rates as compared to 5-9 year olds (10.4 per 100,000 per year) and 10-14 year olds (12.0 per 100,000 per year). In males, the age-adjusted incidence of childhood cancers between 1980 and 1999 was 15.5 cases per 100,000 per year, whereas females had an incidence rate of 13.1 per 100,000 per year. Rates for whites were similar to the rates for all other racial groups combined. Leukemia had the highest age-adjusted incidence rate among childhood cancer diagnostic subtypes (4.3 cases per 100,000 per year); leukemia incidence increased by 32% between 1980 and 1999. Among the 13 hospital referral regions in Wisconsin with reported cancer cases, the Dubuque region had the highest annual age-adjusted incidence rate of 24.6 cases per 100,000, followed by Madison with 15.6 per 100,000, and Milwaukee with 15.5 per 100,000. In general, higher socioeconomic status as reflected by census indicators was positively correlated with higher rates of childhood cancer. SUMMARY: Wisconsin experienced childhood cancer incidence rates and trends similar to those throughout the United States between 1980 and 1999. Analysis of Wisconsin data, which is subject to small numbers in absolute terms (3,138 cases during 1980-1999), suggests that not all children have similar risk--infants and younger children (<5 years of age) as well as children living in areas with higher socioeconomic status may be especially vulnerable.","['Bandi, Priti', 'Dranger, Elizabeth', 'Hampton, John M', 'Trentham-Dietz, Amy']","['Bandi P', 'Dranger E', 'Hampton JM', 'Trentham-Dietz A']","['University of Wisconsin Population Health Program Madison, WI 53726, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,WMJ,WMJ : official publication of the State Medical Society of Wisconsin,9716054,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/*epidemiology', 'Registries', 'Risk Factors', 'Social Class', 'Wisconsin/epidemiology']",,2006/12/14 09:00,2007/01/31 09:00,['2006/12/14 09:00'],"['2006/12/14 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/01/31 09:00 [medline]', '2006/12/14 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,WMJ. 2006 Oct;105(7):30-7.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Case series have previously supported the role of myeloablation and autologous transplantation as a potentially curative treatment. This study aimed to use the large numbers and extended follow-up data in the British Society of Blood and Marrow Transplantation (BSBMT) registry database to establish long-term outcomes and relate these to biological and procedural factors. The BSBMT registry database was used to retrospectively identify 152 adult patients (age, 16-69 years) with AML in second remission treated with autologous transplantation in 1982-2003. Cytogenetic data were available for 68% of the patients; of these, at diagnosis, 42% had good risk features, 57% had standard risk features, and 1% had poor risk features. Conditioning regimens varied; autologous rescue was provided with bone marrow (BM) (71%), peripheral blood stem cells (PBSCs) (18%), or both (11%), which were harvested during first complete remission (CR1) and/or second CR (CR2). Median follow-up was 84 months (range, 2-200 months). At 10 years, actuarial overall survival (OS) was 32%, progression-free survival (PFS) was 28%, and relapse rate (RR) was 57%. The 100-day nonrelapse mortality (NRM) was 7%, rising to 11% at 1 year and to 14% at 10 years. OS was significantly related to M3 subtype (5-year OS, 66%; P = .005), patient age at diagnosis (P = .005) and transplantation (P = .026), and length of CR1, with greatest significance if the patient was dichotomized at CR1 duration of < 8 months or > or = 8 months (P = .0001). There was no difference in OS between regimens containing total body irradiation (TBI) and chemotherapy alone (P = .7). In relation to the nature of autologous graft material, there was improved OS (P = .025) and PFS (P = .009) with the use of cells harvested entirely in CR1 compared with cells harvested in CR2 or in both CR1 and CR2. Engraftment times were significantly shortened with the use of PBSCs alone or in combination with BM compared with BM alone (P = .0001), but there was no significant long-term impact on OS, PFS, RR, or NRM. This study provides long-term follow-up data in one of the largest series of patients with standard-risk and good-risk AML in CR2 treated with autologous transplantation and supports earlier observations that long-term survival is achievable in about 1/3 of patients overall and in about 2/3 of patients with M3 with a relatively low NRM. Outcomes are better in patients with CR1 > or = 8 months by use of grafts obtained entirely in CR1 and use of PBSCs. TBI conditioning did not confer an advantage.

Data on donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI) after mismatched stem cell transplantation are lacking. Our experience with 28 patients (treated with 59 mismatched DLIs; range, 1-7) is described. The procedure was prophylactic in 6 patients (9 DLIs) and therapeutic in 22 (50 DLIs). DLI dose ranged from 10(2) to 1.5 x 10(9) T cells/kg. In the 6 patients receiving prophylactic DLI, complete remission was maintained in 5; however, 2 died from GVHD. Clinical response to therapeutic DLI was seen in 6 of 22 (27.3%) patients; a greater tumor burden produced a lower response. GVHD appeared in 13 of 28 patients. Surprisingly, a greater HLA mismatch was associated with a lower risk of GVHD, with 3 of 19 DLIs in 3/6 matching and 16 of 29 DLIs in 5/6 matching with similar follow-up. Nevertheless, no correlation between efficacy and HLA mismatching was noted. Death was frequent and usually related to the basic disease rather than to DLI complications. We conclude that mismatched DLI is feasible and may be effective, especially if given soon after transplantation. Future developments using cell therapy with selective or targeted anticancer activity are warranted, with special attention to prophylactic treatment of T cell depleted mismatched allografts recipients.","['Or, R', 'Hadar, E', 'Bitan, M', 'Resnick, I B', 'Aker, M', 'Ackerstein, A', 'Samuel, S', 'Tsirigotis, P', 'Gesundheit, B', 'Slavin, S', 'Shapira, M Y']","['Or R', 'Hadar E', 'Bitan M', 'Resnick IB', 'Aker M', 'Ackerstein A', 'Samuel S', 'Tsirigotis P', 'Gesundheit B', 'Slavin S', 'Shapira MY']","['Department of Bone Marrow Transplantation and Cancer Immunotherapy, Hadassah-Hebrew University Medical Center, Jerusalem, Israel.']",['eng'],"['Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Biol Blood Marrow Transplant,Biology of blood and marrow transplantation : journal of the American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation,9600628,['0 (HLA Antigens)'],IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Child, Preschool', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Female', '*Graft Enhancement, Immunologic/statistics & numerical data', 'Graft vs Host Disease/mortality/prevention & control', 'Graft vs Leukemia Effect', 'HLA Antigens/immunology', 'Histocompatibility', 'Humans', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/surgery', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/mortality/*surgery', 'Leukocyte Reduction Procedures', '*Lymphocyte Transfusion/adverse effects', 'Lymphoma/surgery', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/surgery', '*Peripheral Blood Stem Cell Transplantation/statistics & numerical data', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/mortality/surgery', 'Remission Induction', 'Survival Analysis', 'Tissue Donors', 'Transplantation Conditioning', 'Tumor Burden']",,2006/12/13 09:00,2007/03/16 09:00,['2006/12/13 09:00'],"['2006/03/28 00:00 [received]', '2006/07/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2006/12/13 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/03/16 09:00 [medline]', '2006/12/13 09:00 [entrez]']","['S1083-8791(06)00519-2 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bbmt.2006.07.014 [doi]']",ppublish,Biol Blood Marrow Transplant. 2006 Dec;12(12):1295-301. doi: 10.1016/j.bbmt.2006.07.014.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

With the arrival of tyrosine kinase inhibitors, notably imatinib, these trials closed early without reaching their recruitment targets and no trial was able to address its objectives. Following discussions with the principal investigators, it was agreed that a meta-analysis be performed to attempt to determine the effect of ASCT on the main outcomes. OBJECTIVES: To establish the effect of ASCT followed by interferon-alphacompared with interferon-alpha only. FINDINGS: There was no evidence of a difference in survival; odds ratio=0.99 (95% confidence intervals=0.67-1.46). Nor were there statistically significant differences between treatment groups in best haematological or cytogenetic response achieved in the first year. It was not possible to analyse whether autografting with predominantly Philadelphia negative cells early on in the disease resulted in a better outcome.

Little is known, however, about the effects of cellular and molecular mechanisms on human leukemic U937 cells. In the present study, we found that treatment with PD98059 significantly arrests the G1 phase through up-regulation of cyclin-dependent kinase (Cdk) inhibitor, and produces morphological features of apoptosis in U937 cells, which were associated with poly(ADP-ribose)polymerase (PARP) cleavage and PLC-gamma1 degradation. PD98059 also decreased the Cdk-2, Cdk-4, cyclin D1, and cyclin E expression, and increased high levels of the mitotic inhibitors p16(INIa), p21(Waf1), and p27(Kip1). Also, Bcl-2's overexpression and a caspase-3 inhibitor z-DEVD-fmk significantly attenuated PD98059-induced apoptosis through the down-regulation of caspase-3 activity, but did not attenuate G1 phase arrest. Moreover, PD98059 down-regulated Akt phosphorylation and produced a synergy effect of apoptosis with LY294002 co-treatment. Thus, our results imply that PD98059-induced apoptosis is significantly involved in down-regulation of Bcl-2, caspase-3 activity, the Akt pathway, and some of the biological functions in U937 cells.","['Moon, Dong-Oh', 'Park, Cheol', 'Heo, Moon-Soo', 'Park, Yeong-Min', 'Choi, Yung Hyun', 'Kim, Gi-Young']","['Moon DO', 'Park C', 'Heo MS', 'Park YM', 'Choi YH', 'Kim GY']","['Faculty of Applied Marine Science, Cheju National University, Jeju 690-756, South Korea.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20060908,Netherlands,Int Immunopharmacol,International immunopharmacology,100965259,"['0 (Caspase Inhibitors)', '0 (Chromones)', '0 (Cyclin E)', '0 (Flavonoids)', '0 (Morpholines)', '0 (Oligopeptides)', '0 (Phosphoinositide-3 Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (benzoylcarbonyl-aspartyl-glutamyl-valyl-aspartyl-fluoromethyl ketone)', '136601-57-5 (Cyclin D1)', '31M2U1DVID (2-(4-morpholinyl)-8-phenyl-4H-1-benzopyran-4-one)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 2)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 4)', 'EC 2.7.11.25 (MAP Kinase Kinase Kinases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'SJE1IO5E3I (2-(2-amino-3-methoxyphenyl)-4H-1-benzopyran-4-one)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Caspase 3/metabolism', 'Caspase Inhibitors', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Chromones/pharmacology', 'Cyclin D1/metabolism', 'Cyclin E/metabolism', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 2/metabolism', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 4/metabolism', 'Down-Regulation', 'Flavonoids/*pharmacology', 'G1 Phase/drug effects', 'Humans', 'MAP Kinase Kinase Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Morpholines/pharmacology', 'Oligopeptides/pharmacology', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/metabolism', 'Phosphoinositide-3 Kinase Inhibitors', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'U937 Cells']",,2006/12/13 09:00,2007/02/08 09:00,['2006/12/13 09:00'],"['2006/06/27 00:00 [received]', '2006/08/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2006/12/13 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/02/08 09:00 [medline]', '2006/12/13 09:00 [entrez]']","['S1567-5769(06)00254-2 [pii]', '10.1016/j.intimp.2006.08.009 [doi]']",ppublish,Int Immunopharmacol. 2007 Jan;7(1):36-45. doi: 10.1016/j.intimp.2006.08.009.

Interestingly, benzene-initiated hematotoxicity is absent in mice lacking the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) suggesting an imperative role for this receptor in benzene toxicities. This study investigated two potential roles for the AhR in benzene toxicity using hepa 1c1c7 wild type and AhR deficient cells. Considering that many toxic effects of AhR ligands are dependent on AhR activation, our first objective was to determine if benzene, hydroquinone (HQ) or benzoquinone (BQ) could activate the AhR. Secondly, because the AhR regulates a number of enzymes involved in oxidative stress pathways, we sought to determine if the AhR had a role in HQ and BQ induced production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Dual luciferase assays measuring dioxin response element (DRE) activation showed no significant change in DRE activity after exposure to benzene, HQ or BQ for 24h. Immunofluorescence staining showed cytosolic localization of the AhR after 2h incubations with benzene, HQ or BQ. Western blot analysis of cells exposed to benzene, HQ or BQ for 1, 12 and 24h did not demonstrate induction of CYP1A1 protein expression. Dichlorodihydrofluorescein staining of cells exposed to benzene, HQ or BQ revealed that the presence of the AhR did not affect BQ and HQ induced ROS production. These results indicate that the involvement of the AhR in benzene toxicity does not seem to be through classical activation of this receptor or through interference of oxidative stress pathways.","['Badham, Helen J', 'Winn, Louise M']","['Badham HJ', 'Winn LM']","[""Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, Queen's University, Kingston, Ontario K7L 3N6, Canada.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20061107,Ireland,Toxicology,Toxicology,0361055,"['0 (Benzoquinones)', '0 (Carcinogens)', '0 (Hydroquinones)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '0 (Receptors, Aryl Hydrocarbon)', '3T006GV98U (quinone)', 'EC 1.14.14.1 (Cytochrome P-450 CYP1A1)', 'J64922108F (Benzene)', 'XV74C1N1AE (hydroquinone)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Benzene/*toxicity', 'Benzoquinones/toxicity', 'Carcinogens/*toxicity', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP1A1/metabolism', 'Gene Expression/drug effects', 'Hydroquinones/toxicity', 'Mice', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism', 'Receptors, Aryl Hydrocarbon/deficiency/genetics/*metabolism', 'Response Elements/genetics']",,2006/12/13 09:00,2007/03/01 09:00,['2006/12/13 09:00'],"['2006/07/19 00:00 [received]', '2006/10/05 00:00 [revised]', '2006/10/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2006/12/13 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/03/01 09:00 [medline]', '2006/12/13 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0300-483X(06)00622-6 [pii]', '10.1016/j.tox.2006.10.021 [doi]']",ppublish,Toxicology. 2007 Jan 18;229(3):177-85. doi: 10.1016/j.tox.2006.10.021.

Canine BM cells were separated by equilibrium discontinued density centrifugation, and HPCs, detected by in vitro colony formation, were significantly enriched in the relatively low density (LD) fraction. In flow cytometry, many CD34 or MHC class II expressing cells were detected in the LD fraction, but these were not significantly enriched. When the LD cells were separated, using a cell-sorting method, into cells with high affinity of wheat germ agglutinin (WGAhigh) and cells with WGAlow, almost all multipotent HPCs (MHPCs) and HPCs committed to myeloid lineage were found in the WGAhigh population. When the WGAhigh population was further stained for rhodamin 123, almost all MHPCs were included in the dull population (Rhlow), but not in the bright one (Rhhigh). Morphologically, most Rhlow cells were round, blastic cells containing a large nucleus with nucleoli and narrow cytoplasm.

Given this coordinate correlation with tolerance, we now ask if Foxp3 expression is influenced by LIF or by axotrophin. In spleen cells from allo-rejected mice we found that exogenous LIF reduced interferon gamma release in response to donor antigen by 50%, but LIF had no direct effect on levels of Foxp3 protein in allo-primed cells that were either tolerant, or aggressive, for donor antigen. However, we did find an effect of axotrophin on Foxp3: in the axotrophin null mouse, thymic Foxp3 transcripts were reduced compared to axotrophin wildtype littermates. To test whether these findings in the mouse were of potential significance in man we measured transcript levels of axotrophin and LIF in peripheral blood cell samples collected for a recently published clinical study concerning haematopoietic stem cell recipients. In controls, human peripheral blood CD4+CD25+cells contained significantly more FOXP3 and axotrophin than CD4+CD25-cells. In bone marrow autograft recipients, where peripheral blood cell samples directly represent both the grafted tissue and the immune response, both FOXP3 and axotrophin negatively correlated with graft versus host disease (GVHD).

By oligonucleotide microarray hybridization of polysomal RNA of untreated and STI571-treated 32D-BCR/ABL cells, we identified the beta-chemokine CCL9 as a gene regulated by BCR/ABL in a tyrosine kinase-dependent manner. BCR/ABL repressed CCL9 expression at the transcriptional level by mechanisms involving suppression of p38 MAP kinase, and modulation of the activity of CDP/cut and C/EBPalpha, two transcription regulators of myeloid differentiation. However, repression of C/EBP-dependent transcription did not prevent the induction of CCL9 expression by STI571, suggesting that C/EBPalpha is involved in maintaining rather than in inducing CCL9 expression. Restoration of CCL9 expression in 32D-BCR/ABL cells had no effect on the in vitro proliferation of these cells, but reduced their leukemogenic potential in vivo, possibly by recruitment of CD3-positive immune cells. Together, these findings suggest that downregulation of chemokine expression may be involved in BCR/ABL-dependent leukemogenesis by altering the relationship between transformed cells and the microenvironment.","['Iotti, G', 'Ferrari-Amorotti, G', 'Rosafio, C', 'Corradini, F', 'Lidonnici, M R', 'Ronchetti, M', 'Bardini, M', 'Zhang, Y', 'Martinez, R', 'Blasi, F', 'Calabretta, B']","['Iotti G', 'Ferrari-Amorotti G', 'Rosafio C', 'Corradini F', 'Lidonnici MR', 'Ronchetti M', 'Bardini M', 'Zhang Y', 'Martinez R', 'Blasi F', 'Calabretta B']","['Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Kimmel Cancer Center, Thomas Jefferson Medical College, Philadelphia, PA 19107, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20061211,England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (Benzamides)', '0 (CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Protein-alpha)', '0 (Ccl9 protein, mouse)', '0 (Chemokines, CC)', '0 (Cux1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (Macrophage Inflammatory Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Benzamides', 'Bone Marrow Cells/pathology', 'CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Protein-alpha/genetics/metabolism', 'Carcinogenicity Tests', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Chemokines, CC', 'Down-Regulation', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Homeodomain Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*genetics/pathology', 'Macrophage Inflammatory Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C3H', 'Mice, SCID', 'Nuclear Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Piperazines/pharmacology', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Pyrimidines/pharmacology', 'Repressor Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism']",,2006/12/13 09:00,2007/07/13 09:00,['2006/12/13 09:00'],"['2006/12/13 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/07/13 09:00 [medline]', '2006/12/13 09:00 [entrez]']","['1210146 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.onc.1210146 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2007 May 24;26(24):3482-91. doi: 10.1038/sj.onc.1210146.

Moreover, reproducing the switching of importin-alpha subtype expression in undifferentiated ES cells induced neural differentiation in the presence of leukaemia inhibitory factor (LIF) and serum, coordinated with the regulated expression of Oct3/4, Brn2 and SOX2, which are involved in ES-neural identity determination.

Although a major commonly deleted region (CDR) has been delineated on chromosome band 5q31.1 (refs. 3-7), attempts to identify tumor suppressors within this band have been unsuccessful. We focused our analysis of gene expression on RNA from primitive leukemia-initiating cells, which harbor 5q deletions, and analyzed 12 genes within the CDR that are expressed by normal hematopoietic stem cells. Here we show that the gene encoding alpha-catenin (CTNNA1) is expressed at a much lower level in leukemia-initiating stem cells from individuals with AML or MDS with a 5q deletion than in individuals with MDS or AML lacking a 5q deletion or in normal hematopoietic stem cells. Analysis of HL-60 cells, a myeloid leukemia line with deletion of the 5q31 region, showed that the CTNNA1 promoter of the retained allele is suppressed by both methylation and histone deacetylation. Restoration of CTNNA1 expression in HL-60 cells resulted in reduced proliferation and apoptotic cell death. Thus, loss of expression of the alpha-catenin tumor suppressor in hematopoietic stem cells may provide a growth advantage that contributes to human MDS or AML with del(5q).","['Liu, Ting Xi', 'Becker, Michael W', 'Jelinek, Jaroslav', 'Wu, Wen-Shu', 'Deng, Min', 'Mikhalkevich, Natallia', 'Hsu, Karl', 'Bloomfield, Clara D', 'Stone, Richard M', 'DeAngelo, Daniel J', 'Galinsky, Ilene A', 'Issa, Jean-Pierre', 'Clarke, Michael F', 'Look, A Thomas']","['Liu TX', 'Becker MW', 'Jelinek J', 'Wu WS', 'Deng M', 'Mikhalkevich N', 'Hsu K', 'Bloomfield CD', 'Stone RM', 'DeAngelo DJ', 'Galinsky IA', 'Issa JP', 'Clarke MF', 'Look AT']","['Laboratory of Development and Diseases, Institute of Health Sciences, Shanghai Institutes for Biological Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences and Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai 200025, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20061210,United States,Nat Med,Nature medicine,9502015,"['0 (CTNNA1 protein, human)', '0 (Hydroxamic Acids)', '0 (alpha Catenin)', '147336-22-9 (Green Fluorescent Proteins)', '3X2S926L3Z (trichostatin A)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Line, Tumor', '*Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', '*Chromosome Deletion', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 5/*genetics', 'DNA Methylation/drug effects', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'Green Fluorescent Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Hydroxamic Acids/pharmacology', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence/methods', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/blood/genetics/pathology', 'Mutation', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/blood/genetics/pathology', 'Myeloid Progenitor Cells/metabolism/*pathology', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Transfection', 'U937 Cells', 'alpha Catenin/*genetics/metabolism']",,2006/12/13 09:00,2007/02/27 09:00,['2006/12/13 09:00'],"['2006/07/25 00:00 [received]', '2006/11/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2006/12/13 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/02/27 09:00 [medline]', '2006/12/13 09:00 [entrez]']","['nm1512 [pii]', '10.1038/nm1512 [doi]']",ppublish,Nat Med. 2007 Jan;13(1):78-83. doi: 10.1038/nm1512.

(ECC) had antimutagenic effect and was able to enhance the therapeutic effect of cytostatic drug cis-platinum (cis-Pt). METHODS: The potential antimutagenic activity of ECC was assayed by a test on sex-linked recessive lethal mutations detection in Drosophila melanogaster males treated with ethylmethane sulfonate (EMS). The possible enhancement of cytostatic/cytotoxic effect of cis-Pt by ECC was evaluated in the cell revitalization assay by measuring cell viability via Trypan blue exclusive assay using mouse leukemia cells L1210. RESULTS: EMS was both toxic and genotoxic in D. melanogaster males. It statistically significantly increased the frequency of sex-linked recessive lethal mutations in comparison to the negative control. Furthermore, ECC statistically significantly reduced the genotoxic effect of EMS. It acted in a desmutagenic manner via EMS inactivation. In the cell revitalization assay, ECC enhanced the cytotoxic/cytostatic effect of cis-Pt. The therapeutic potential of ECC was established on the basis of statistically significantly lowered recovery of cis-Pt pre-treated mouse leukemia cells in the presence of ECC.

In this study, we report the preclinical toxicity study of a single acute dose of C-1748 in Copenhagen rats and BALB/c mice, intraperitoneally and intravenously for 24 h and 7 days. The effect of C-1748 on hematology, cardiac and liver enzymes, and renal electrolytes was assessed by blood and serum analysis. The LD50 (lethal dose, 50%) for C-1748 was 9 and 13.42 mg/kg compared with 2.2 and 3 mg/kg for C-857 intraperitoneally and intravenously, respectively, in mice. In Copenhagen rats, LD50 was 15 and 14.4 mg/kg intraperitoneally and intravenously, respectively, compared to 4 and 1.3 mg/kg for C-857. No changes in blood cell counts were observed, which were in the normal range for rodents. No changes were observed in clinical chemistries of enzymes such as aspartate aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase and creatine phosphokinase, which were within the normal range of values. No genome alterations were seen in prostate cancer cell lines by comparative genomic hybridization together with a lack of systemic toxicity, making it a unique cancer cell-type-specific drug that needs further clinical evaluation for toxicity and synergy in combination chemotherapy regimens.","['Ashok, Badithe T', 'Tadi, Kiranmayi', 'Garikapaty, Venkata P S', 'Chen, Yuangen', 'Huang, Qiang', 'Banerjee, Debabrata', 'Konopa, Jerzy', 'Tiwari, Raj K']","['Ashok BT', 'Tadi K', 'Garikapaty VP', 'Chen Y', 'Huang Q', 'Banerjee D', 'Konopa J', 'Tiwari RK']","['Department of Microbiology & Immunology, New York Medical College, Valhalla, New York 10595, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Anticancer Drugs,Anti-cancer drugs,9100823,"[""0 (9-(2'-hydroxyethylamino)-4-methyl-1-nitroacridine)"", '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '712MLZ30SB (Nitracrine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Blood/*drug effects', 'DNA, Neoplasm/drug effects', 'Injections, Intraperitoneal', 'Injections, Intravenous', 'Kidney/*drug effects', 'Lethal Dose 50', 'Liver/*drug effects/enzymology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Nitracrine/administration & dosage/*analogs & derivatives/therapeutic use/toxicity', 'Nucleic Acid Hybridization', 'Prostatic Neoplasms/drug therapy', 'Rats']",,2006/12/13 09:00,2007/01/31 09:00,['2006/12/13 09:00'],"['2006/12/13 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/01/31 09:00 [medline]', '2006/12/13 09:00 [entrez]']","['10.1097/01.cad.0000236316.04199.20 [doi]', '00001813-200701000-00011 [pii]']",ppublish,Anticancer Drugs. 2007 Jan;18(1):87-94. doi: 10.1097/01.cad.0000236316.04199.20.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: We conducted a case-control study among women treated for breast cancer between 1985 and 2001 in French general hospitals, cancer centers, or clinics. We included 182 AML and MDS patients and 534 matched controls. Breast cancer characteristics, type of treatment, and family history of cancer were compared in both groups. RESULTS: The risk of AML/MDS was increased after topoisomerase-II inhibitor-based chemotherapy (P < 10-16) and was higher for mitoxantrone-based chemotherapy than for anthracycline-based chemotherapy (relative risk [RR] = 15.6; 95% CI, 7.1 to 34.2; and RR = 2.7; 95% CI, 1.7 to 4.5, respectively). After adjustment for other treatment components, the risk of AML/MDS in patients who received radiotherapy was multiplied by 3.9 (95% CI, 1.4 to 10.8) but was not increased by alkylating agents. Patients receiving granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) support had an increased risk of AML/MDS (RR = 6.3; 95% CI, 1.9 to 21), even when controlling for chemotherapy doses. Similar results were obtained when AML and MDS were considered separately. CONCLUSION: This large case-control study demonstrates that the risk of AML/MDS is much higher with mitoxantrone-based chemotherapy than with anthracyclines-based chemotherapy in a population of women recently treated for breast cancer. The risk of AML/MDS associated with mitoxantrone must be kept in mind when using this drug to treat diseases other than breast cancer (eg, prostate cancer or multiple sclerosis). In addition, our study suggests the need to monitor the long-term effects of G-CSF therapy.","['Le Deley, Marie-Cecile', 'Suzan, Florence', 'Cutuli, Bruno', 'Delaloge, Suzette', 'Shamsaldin, Akthar', 'Linassier, Claude', 'Clisant, Stephanie', 'de Vathaire, Florent', 'Fenaux, Pierre', 'Hill, Catherine']","['Le Deley MC', 'Suzan F', 'Cutuli B', 'Delaloge S', 'Shamsaldin A', 'Linassier C', 'Clisant S', 'de Vathaire F', 'Fenaux P', 'Hill C']","['Biostatistics and Epidemiology Unit, Department of Medicine, , Institut Gustave-Roussy, Villejuif, France. le_deley@igr.fr']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20061211,United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,"['0 (Anthracyclines)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', 'BZ114NVM5P (Mitoxantrone)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Anthracyclines/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Breast Neoplasms/*drug therapy/*radiotherapy', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Female', 'France/epidemiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*chemically induced/epidemiology', 'Middle Aged', 'Mitoxantrone/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*chemically induced/epidemiology', '*Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced/epidemiology', 'Risk Factors']",,2006/12/13 09:00,2007/01/26 09:00,['2006/12/13 09:00'],"['2006/12/13 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/01/26 09:00 [medline]', '2006/12/13 09:00 [entrez]']","['JCO.2006.05.9048 [pii]', '10.1200/JCO.2006.05.9048 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2007 Jan 20;25(3):292-300. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2006.05.9048.

METHODS: We reviewed 361 consecutive patients over 6 years, including 245 autologous and 116 allogeneic HPCT recipients for hematologic malignancies (87%) and solid cancers (13%). RESULTS: Fifty-seven patients developed 65 symptomatic neurologic complications (16%), with a higher incidence in allogeneic than in autologous HPCT recipients (p = 0.01) and in chronic myelogenous leukemia (42%) than in Hodgkin disease (2.5%) (p < 0.001). CNS infections (4.2%) were the main complications, marked by an early onset (within the first 4 months) after HPCT (87%), diagnostic difficulties, and a high mortality rate (47%). They mainly included cerebral toxoplasmosis, fungal infections, and viral encephalitis. Their incidence was markedly higher in allogeneic than in autologous HPCT recipients (p = 0.002). However, two CD34(+) selected autologous HPCT recipients developed cerebral toxoplasmosis. Other CNS complications included recurrent tumors (3.6%), metabolic encephalopathies (2.8%), and cerebrovascular events (1.7%). Seizures occurred in 5% of patients, most often associated with cerebral lesions. Peripheral nervous system manifestations occurred in 3.3%. Twenty-one patients (5.8%) died directly of neurologic complications. The 4-year probability of survival was markedly lower in the case of neurologic events than in the absence thereof (12% vs 58%, p < 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: Severe neurologic complications after hematopoietic progenitor cell transplantations are common, vary according to the underlying disease and type of transplantation, and are associated with poor survival rates. Better prophylactic protocols and therapy for CNS infections are required in future studies.","['Denier, C', 'Bourhis, J-H', 'Lacroix, C', 'Koscielny, S', 'Bosq, J', 'Sigal, R', 'Said, G', 'Adams, D']","['Denier C', 'Bourhis JH', 'Lacroix C', 'Koscielny S', 'Bosq J', 'Sigal R', 'Said G', 'Adams D']","['Department of Neurology, Bicetre Hospital AP-HP, France.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",,United States,Neurology,Neurology,0401060,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/adverse effects/*mortality', 'Humans', 'Middle Aged', 'Nervous System Diseases/diagnosis/etiology/*mortality', 'Postoperative Complications/diagnosis/etiology/*mortality', 'Prognosis', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Rate']",,2006/12/13 09:00,2007/01/09 09:00,['2006/12/13 09:00'],"['2006/12/13 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/01/09 09:00 [medline]', '2006/12/13 09:00 [entrez]']","['67/11/1990 [pii]', '10.1212/01.wnl.0000247038.43228.17 [doi]']",ppublish,Neurology. 2006 Dec 12;67(11):1990-7. doi: 10.1212/01.wnl.0000247038.43228.17.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We conducted an intention-to-treat analysis of the strategy of SCT as definitive treatment of T-LBL. PATIENTS AND METHODS: From July 1987 to March 2005, 34 adults with T-LBL were diagnosed and treated in British Columbia. Treatment, before planned SCT, consisted of a non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL)/acute lymphoblastic leukemia hybrid chemotherapy protocol (28 patients) or a standard NHL chemotherapy regimen (six patients). RESULTS: Median follow-up of the 23 surviving patients is 51 months (range 13-142 months). Twenty-nine proceeded to SCT (four allogeneic, 25 autologous). For all 34 patients, 4-year overall survival (OS) and event-free survival (EFS) are 72% and 68%, respectively. For patients proceeding to SCT, the 4-year OS and EFS are 79% and 73%, respectively. All patients who received allografts are alive without disease at 38-141 months since diagnosis. For patients who received autografts, the 4-year EFS is 69%. Bone marrow involvement was a significant prognostic factor predicting for a worse survival (P = 0.02). CONCLUSION: A treatment strategy for adults with chemosensitive T-LBL that includes planned consolidation with SCT in first response produces favorable long-term outcome.","['Song, K W', 'Barnett, M J', 'Gascoyne, R D', 'Chhanabhai, M', 'Forrest, D L', 'Hogge, D E', 'Lavoie, J C', 'Nantel, S H', 'Nevill, T J', 'Shepherd, J D', 'Smith, C A', 'Sutherland, H J', 'Toze, C L', 'Voss, N J', 'Connors, J M']","['Song KW', 'Barnett MJ', 'Gascoyne RD', 'Chhanabhai M', 'Forrest DL', 'Hogge DE', 'Lavoie JC', 'Nantel SH', 'Nevill TJ', 'Shepherd JD', 'Smith CA', 'Sutherland HJ', 'Toze CL', 'Voss NJ', 'Connors JM']","['The Leukemia/Bone Marrow Transplant Program of British Columbia, The Vancouver Hospital and Health Science Center, Division of Medical Oncology, British Columbia Cancer Agency and University of British Columbia, Canada. ksong@bccancer.bc.ca']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20061208,England,Ann Oncol,Annals of oncology : official journal of the European Society for Medical Oncology,9007735,,IM,"['Adult', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'British Columbia', 'Chemotherapy, Adjuvant', 'Databases as Topic', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoadjuvant Therapy', 'Practice Guidelines as Topic', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/mortality/pathology/*surgery', 'Prognosis', 'Recurrence', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Time Factors', 'Transplantation, Autologous', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Treatment Outcome']",,2006/12/13 09:00,2007/08/11 09:00,['2006/12/13 09:00'],"['2006/12/13 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/08/11 09:00 [medline]', '2006/12/13 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0923-7534(19)37831-7 [pii]', '10.1093/annonc/mdl426 [doi]']",ppublish,Ann Oncol. 2007 Mar;18(3):535-40. doi: 10.1093/annonc/mdl426.

ASCO developed this report to demonstrate the enormous progress being made on the front lines of cancer research today. The report is intended to give all those with an interest in cancer care-the general public, cancer patients and physicians, policymakers, oncologists, and other medical professionals-an accessible summary of the year's most important cancer research advances. These pages report on new targeted therapies that are improving survival and response rates in hard-to-treat cancers such as kidney cancer, HER-2-positive breast cancer, head and neck cancer, and chronic myelogenous leukemia; the FDA's approval of the world's first preventive vaccine for human papillomavirus (HPV), which has the potential to dramatically reduce the global burden of cervical cancer; and advances in the fast-growing field of personalized medicine, including a new lung cancer test that could help physicians better target treatments and predict prognosis. These advances are only part of the landscape. Survival rates are on the rise, the number of cancer deaths in the United States began declining for the first time since 1930, and new research is showing that the rates of certain common cancers, such as those of the breast and colon, have stabilized, and may have even begun to decline. However, cancer research still faces a number of major obstacles. At a time of extraordinary scientific potential, declining federal funding of cancer research threatens to stall or even reverse recent progress. Such funding cuts have already led to fewer clinical trials, fewer talented young physicians entering the field, and a growing bottleneck of basic science discoveries waiting to be ""translated"" into useful therapies and diagnostics. In addition to highlighting the major research advances over the past year, this report also identifies key barriers to accelerating the pace of cancer research and outlines ASCO's recommendations for overcoming them. Despite these and other challenges, there is much good news on the front lines of cancer research. This report demonstrates the essential role of clinical cancer research in finding new and better ways to treat, diagnose, and prevent a group of diseases that strike half of men and one-third of women in the United States.","['Ozols, Robert F', 'Herbst, Roy S', 'Colson, Yolonda L', 'Gralow, Julie', 'Bonner, James', 'Curran, Walter J Jr', 'Eisenberg, Burton L', 'Ganz, Patricia A', 'Kramer, Barnett S', 'Kris, Mark G', 'Markman, Maurie', 'Mayer, Robert J', 'Raghavan, Derek', 'Reaman, Gregory H', 'Sawaya, Raymond', 'Schilsky, Richard L', 'Schuchter, Lynn M', 'Sweetenham, John W', 'Vahdat, Linda T', 'Winn, Rodger J']","['Ozols RF', 'Herbst RS', 'Colson YL', 'Gralow J', 'Bonner J', 'Curran WJ Jr', 'Eisenberg BL', 'Ganz PA', 'Kramer BS', 'Kris MG', 'Markman M', 'Mayer RJ', 'Raghavan D', 'Reaman GH', 'Sawaya R', 'Schilsky RL', 'Schuchter LM', 'Sweetenham JW', 'Vahdat LT', 'Winn RJ']","['American Society of Clinical Oncology, Alexandria, VA 22314, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20061208,United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,,IM,"['Breast Neoplasms/therapy', 'Central Nervous System Neoplasms/therapy', 'Female', 'Gastrointestinal Neoplasms/therapy', 'Genital Neoplasms, Female/therapy', 'Head and Neck Neoplasms/therapy', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/therapy', 'Humans', 'Lung Neoplasms/therapy', 'Male', 'Medical Oncology', 'Neoplasms/diagnosis/mortality/prevention & control/*therapy', 'Research', 'Skin Neoplasms/therapy', 'Urogenital Neoplasms/therapy']",,2006/12/13 09:00,2007/01/30 09:00,['2006/12/13 09:00'],"['2006/12/13 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/01/30 09:00 [medline]', '2006/12/13 09:00 [entrez]']","['JCO.2006.09.7030 [pii]', '10.1200/JCO.2006.09.7030 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2007 Jan 1;25(1):146-62. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2006.09.7030.

So far, they have not been extensively used for gain or loss of function studies since they are resistant to most common transfection methods. Herein, we tested several classic transfection methods on human multipotent adipose tissue-derived stem (hMADS) cells. Our results showed that lipofectants and calcium phosphate were poorly efficient for transgene delivery in hMADS cells. In contrast, nucleofection, an electroporation-based method that is assumed to target plasmid DNA directly to the cell nucleus, led to a significant transient transgene expression in hMADS cells (up to 76% enhanced green fluorescent protein [EGFP]-positive cells were detected). Furthermore, after selection of hMADS cells that were nucleofected with a selectable plasmid coding for EGFP, stable EGFP expressing clones could be propagated in culture and efficiently induced to differentiate into EGFP-positive adipocytes and osteoblasts. Finally, we verified that nucleofected hMADS cells could produce a functional, transgene-encoded, secreted protein. To this aim, hMADS cells were nucleofected with a plasmid coding for leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF). This protein was detected at high concentrations in supernatants from pCAG-LIF transfected hMADS cells. Moreover, supernatants were able to maintain mouse embryonic stem cells' undifferentiated phenotype, indicating that hMADS cells could secrete a functional LIF protein. Taken together, our data demonstrate that nucleofection allows both transient and stable gene expression in adipose tissue-derived stem cells, without impairing their differentiation potential.","['Zaragosi, Laure-Emmanuelle', 'Billon, Nathalie', 'Ailhaud, Gerard', 'Dani, Christian']","['Zaragosi LE', 'Billon N', 'Ailhaud G', 'Dani C']","['Institut de Recherche, Signalisation, Biologie du Developpement et Cancer, CNRS UMR6543, Centre de Biochimie, Faculte des Sciences, Universite Nice Sophia-Antipolis, 06108 Nice Cedex 2, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20061207,United States,Stem Cells,"Stem cells (Dayton, Ohio)",9304532,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (MADS Domain Proteins)', '147336-22-9 (Green Fluorescent Proteins)']",IM,"['Adipose Tissue/*cytology/*physiology', 'Animals', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'DNA Primers', 'Electroporation/methods', '*Gene Transfer Techniques', 'Green Fluorescent Proteins/genetics', 'Humans', 'MADS Domain Proteins/genetics', 'Mice', 'Osteogenesis', 'Plasmids', 'Stem Cells/*cytology/*physiology', 'Transfection/*methods']",,2006/12/13 09:00,2007/05/30 09:00,['2006/12/13 09:00'],"['2006/12/13 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/05/30 09:00 [medline]', '2006/12/13 09:00 [entrez]']","['2006-0235 [pii]', '10.1634/stemcells.2006-0235 [doi]']",ppublish,Stem Cells. 2007 Mar;25(3):790-7. doi: 10.1634/stemcells.2006-0235.

Pharmacokinetic studies demonstrated higher and more sustained serum PV levels with PV doses above 1280 mg/day. CR/CRp was obtained in 11 of 15 new patients, including 8 of 10 with unfavorable cytogenetics, and 9 of 22 salvage patients. An MTD for PV + Ida-HDAC was not reached. Addition of PV to Ida-HDAC was safe, and the encouraging response rates support conducting further trials evaluating the effect of cholesterol modulation on response in AML.","['Kornblau, Steven M', 'Banker, Deborah E', 'Stirewalt, Derek', 'Shen, Danny', 'Lemker, Elizabeth', 'Verstovsek, Srdan', 'Estrov, Zeev', 'Faderl, Stefan', 'Cortes, Jorge', 'Beran, Miloslav', 'Jackson, C Ellen', 'Chen, Wenjing', 'Estey, Elihu', 'Appelbaum, Frederick R']","['Kornblau SM', 'Banker DE', 'Stirewalt D', 'Shen D', 'Lemker E', 'Verstovsek S', 'Estrov Z', 'Faderl S', 'Cortes J', 'Beran M', 'Jackson CE', 'Chen W', 'Estey E', 'Appelbaum FR']","['Section of Molecular Hematology and Therapy, Department of Stem Cell Transplantation and Cellular Therapy, The University of Texas M.

Differentiation of prognostic subgroups is based primarily on the mutation status of the genes for the variable region of the immunoglobulin heavy chain (IGHV). The time- and labor-intensive nature of this analysis necessitates the use of easily applicable surrogate markers. METHODS: We developed a quantitative PCR (qPCR) method for determining lipoprotein lipase (LPL) mRNA expression and analyzed samples of lysed whole blood and CD19-selected cells from 50 CLL patients. Associations of LPL and ZAP70 [zeta-chain (TCR) associated protein kinase 70 kDa] expression with IGHV mutation status, overall survival (OS), and treatment-free survival (TFS) were investigated. RESULTS: Lysed samples of whole blood and CD19-selected cells were similar with respect to LPL expression (R = 0.88; P <0.0001). LPL expression was significantly associated with IGHV mutation status [chi(2)(1) = 15.3; P <0.0001] and showed an 89.3% specificity, a 68.2% sensitivity, an 83.3% positive predictive value, and a 78.1% negative predictive value for IGHV mutation status. LPL expression was significantly associated with both OS and TFS in log-rank tests (both P values = 0.002). LPL-positive patients had a significantly shorter median TFS time (23 months) than LPL-negative patients (88 months) (P = 0.002). CONCLUSIONS: LPL mRNA expression is a valuable prognostic marker in CLL. The method does not require cell purification, and its applicability with archived samples facilitates its use in the clinical routine and other studies.","['Van Bockstaele, Femke', 'Pede, Valerie', 'Janssens, Ann', 'Callewaert, Filip', 'Offner, Fritz', 'Verhasselt, Bruno', 'Philippe, Jan']","['Van Bockstaele F', 'Pede V', 'Janssens A', 'Callewaert F', 'Offner F', 'Verhasselt B', 'Philippe J']","['Department of Clinical Chemistry, Microbiology and Immunology, Ghent University, Ghent, Belgium.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20061207,England,Clin Chem,Clinical chemistry,9421549,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Variable Region)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (ZAP-70 Protein-Tyrosine Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (ZAP70 protein, human)', 'EC 3.1.1.34 (Lipoprotein Lipase)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*blood/genetics', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/genetics', 'Immunoglobulin Variable Region/genetics', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/blood/*diagnosis', 'Lipoprotein Lipase/*blood/genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'Prognosis', 'RNA, Messenger/*blood/genetics', 'Survival Analysis', 'ZAP-70 Protein-Tyrosine Kinase/blood']",,2006/12/13 09:00,2007/03/14 09:00,['2006/12/13 09:00'],"['2006/12/13 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/03/14 09:00 [medline]', '2006/12/13 09:00 [entrez]']","['clinchem.2006.076331 [pii]', '10.1373/clinchem.2006.076331 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Chem. 2007 Feb;53(2):204-12. doi: 10.1373/clinchem.2006.076331.

Several new beta-diketo acid analogs with the phenanthridinone scaffold replaced by phenanthrene, anthracene or pyrene exhibited the highest IN inhibitory potency. There is a general selectivity against the integrase strand transfer step. The most potent IN was 2,4-dioxo-4-phenanthren-9-yl-butyric acid (27f) with an IC(50) of 0.38microM against integrase strand transfer. The phenanthrene diketo acids 27d-f were more potent (IC(50)=2.7-0.38microM) than the corresponding phenanthridinone diketo acid 16 (IC(50)=65microM), suggesting that the polar amide bridge in the phenanthridinone system decreases inhibitory activity relative to the more lipophilic phenanthrene system. This might have to do with the possible binding of the aryl group of the compounds binding to a lipophilic pocket at the integrase active site as suggested by the docking simulations. Molecular modeling also suggested that effectiveness of chelation of the active site Mg(2+) contributes to IN inhibitory potency. Finally, some of the potent compounds inhibited HIV-1 replication in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) with EC(50) down to 8microM for phenanthrene-3-(2,4-dioxo)butyric acid (27d), with a selectivity index of 10 against PBMCs.","['Patil, Shivaputra', 'Kamath, Shantaram', 'Sanchez, Tino', 'Neamati, Nouri', 'Schinazi, Raymond F', 'Buolamwini, John K']","['Patil S', 'Kamath S', 'Sanchez T', 'Neamati N', 'Schinazi RF', 'Buolamwini JK']","['Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, College of Pharmacy, University of Tennessee Health Science Center, Memphis, TN 38163, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",20061116,England,Bioorg Med Chem,Bioorganic & medicinal chemistry,9413298,"['0 (2,4-dioxo-4-phenanthren-9-yl-butyric acid)', '0 (Butyrates)', '0 (HIV Integrase Inhibitors)', '0 (Keto Acids)', '0 (Phenanthrenes)', '0 (Phenanthridines)', 'EC 2.7.7.- (HIV Integrase)', 'I38ZP9992A (Magnesium)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Butyrates/*chemical synthesis/chemistry/pharmacology', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chlorocebus aethiops', 'Crystallography, X-Ray', 'HIV Integrase/chemistry/*metabolism', 'HIV Integrase Inhibitors/chemical synthesis/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'HIV-1/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Keto Acids/*chemical synthesis/chemistry/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/drug therapy/metabolism/virology', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/drug effects', 'Magnesium', 'Models, Molecular', 'Molecular Structure', 'Phenanthrenes/*chemical synthesis/chemistry/pharmacology', 'Phenanthridines/*chemical synthesis/chemistry/pharmacology', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Vero Cells/drug effects', 'Virus Replication/drug effects']",,2006/12/13 09:00,2007/04/06 09:00,['2006/12/13 09:00'],"['2006/04/15 00:00 [received]', '2006/11/04 00:00 [revised]', '2006/11/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2006/12/13 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/04/06 09:00 [medline]', '2006/12/13 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0968-0896(06)00954-0 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bmc.2006.11.026 [doi]']",ppublish,Bioorg Med Chem. 2007 Feb 1;15(3):1212-28. doi: 10.1016/j.bmc.2006.11.026.

Biochemical tests showed severe hypercalcemia and the peripheral white blood cell count revealed an atypical lymphocytosis. ATLL was diagnosed by immunophenotypic and morphological analysis of circulating lymphocytes, bone marrow and lymphatic node biopsy. Level of serum parathyroid hormone-related protein was not increased. We discuss the mechanism of hypercalcemia in this context.

RESULTS: Corneal opacities were identified in 15 of 25 patients (60%) with ATL and five of 18 patients (28%) with HAM/TSP. The prevalence of corneal opacities was associated statistically with elevated IgG level (P = .023) in patients with ATL, but not in patients with HAM/TSP (P > .99).

Markers of Leishmania infection were searched in 183 cats from Southern Spain by IFAT, PCR, Giemsa stain and culture, with a follow-up of positive cats. Seropositivity was 60.0% (Ab titer > or =10) and 28.3% of animals presented Ab titers > or =40. Around 25.7% of the cats studied were parasitemic and some of them remained positive for months. Combining both data, 70.6% of the feline population was, or could be, infected. We observed a negative association between seropositivity to Leishmania and infection by FeLV. Hence, production of antibodies against the parasite appears to be compromised in cats with leukemia, which have a prevalence of 36% in our study. In contrast, we found no association with feline immunodeficiency. The results makes us doubt the value of conventional serological methods to detect active Leishmania infection in cats.","['Martin-Sanchez, J', 'Acedo, C', 'Munoz-Perez, M', 'Pesson, B', 'Marchal, O', 'Morillas-Marquez, F']","['Martin-Sanchez J', 'Acedo C', 'Munoz-Perez M', 'Pesson B', 'Marchal O', 'Morillas-Marquez F']","['Dep.

Toxic effects of DBA in the prechronic studies were detected in the liver (hepatocellular cytoplasmic vacuolization in rats and mice) and testes (delayed spermiation and atypical residual bodies in male rats and mice, and atrophy of the germinal epithelium in rats). In the 2-year studies, neoplasms were induced at multiple sites in rats and mice exposed to DBA; these included mononuclear cell leukemia and abdominal cavity mesothliomas in rats, and neoplasms of the liver (hepatocellular adenoma or carcinoma and hepatoblastoma) and lung (alveolar adenoma or carcinoma) in mice. The increase in incidence of hepatocellular neoplasms in male mice was significant even at the lowest exposure concentration of 50mg/L, which is equivalent to an average daily dose of approximately 4mg/kg. These studies provide critical information for future re-evaluations of health-based drinking water standards for haloacetic acids.","['Melnick, Ronald L', 'Nyska, Abraham', 'Foster, Paul M', 'Roycroft, Joseph H', 'Kissling, Grace E']","['Melnick RL', 'Nyska A', 'Foster PM', 'Roycroft JH', 'Kissling GE']","['Environmental Toxicology Program, National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, P.O.

The predisposition of mobile elements towards participation in genomic rearrangements is largely a consequence of their interspersed homologous nature. As tracts of nonallelic sequence homology, they have the potential to interact in a disruptive manner during both meiotic recombination and DNA repair processes, resulting in genomic alterations ranging from deletions and duplications to large-scale chromosomal rearrangements. Although the deleterious effects of transposable element (TE) insertion events have been extensively documented, it is arguably through post-insertion genomic instability that they pose the greatest hazard to their host genomes. Despite the periodic generation of important evolutionary innovations, genomic alterations involving TE sequences are far more frequently neutral or deleterious in nature. The potentially negative consequences of this instability are perhaps best illustrated by the >25 human genetic diseases that are attributable to TE-mediated rearrangements. Some of these rearrangements, such as those involving the MLL locus in leukemia and the LDL receptor in familial hypercholesterolemia, represent recurrent mutations that have independently arisen multiple times in human populations. While TE-instability has been a potent force in shaping eukaryotic genomes and a significant source of genetic disease, much concerning the mechanisms governing the frequency and variety of these events remains to be clarified. Here we survey the current state of knowledge regarding the mechanisms underlying mobile element-based genetic instability in mammals. Compared to simpler eukaryotic systems, mammalian cells appear to have several modifications to their DNA-repair ensemble that allow them to better cope with the large amount of interspersed homology that has been generated by TEs. In addition to the disruptive potential of nonallelic sequence homology, we also consider recent evidence suggesting that the endonuclease products of TEs may also play a key role in instigating mammalian genomic instability.","['Hedges, D J', 'Deininger, P L']","['Hedges DJ', 'Deininger PL']","['Tulane Cancer Center, SL66 and Department of Epidemiology, Tulane University Health Sciences Center, 1430 Tulane Avenue, New Orleans, LA 70112, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", 'Review']",20061208,Netherlands,Mutat Res,Mutation research,0400763,"['0 (DNA Transposable Elements)', '0 (Mutagens)', 'EC 3.1.- (Endonucleases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', '*DNA Breaks, Double-Stranded', 'DNA Repair', '*DNA Transposable Elements', 'Endonucleases/genetics', '*Genomic Instability', 'Humans', 'Interspersed Repetitive Sequences', 'Models, Genetic', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutagens', 'Recombination, Genetic', 'Sequence Deletion', 'Transcription, Genetic']",95,2006/12/13 09:00,2007/05/03 09:00,['2006/12/13 09:00'],"['2006/12/13 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/05/03 09:00 [medline]', '2006/12/13 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0027-5107(06)00333-2 [pii]', '10.1016/j.mrfmmm.2006.11.021 [doi]']",ppublish,Mutat Res. 2007 Mar 1;616(1-2):46-59. doi: 10.1016/j.mrfmmm.2006.11.021.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Cell lines derived from several human hematologic malignancies were introduced into chick embryos using four different methods. RESULTS: K562 cells engraft in 100% of embryos following intravascular or intra-amniotic injection. The engraftment is rapid, appearing as soon as 7 days after injection, in striking contrast to the 4 weeks and more required for engrafting severe combined immunodeficient mice with human leukemia by systemic injection. The engraftment is easily visualized in vivo as tumor nodules in the chicken chorioallantoic membrane (CAM). In addition, leukemia is consistently detected in the embryos' hematopoietic organs by polymerase chain reaction amplification of human-specific DNA sequences. Consistent engraftment was also obtained using another leukemia cell line (DAMI). Finally, we demonstrate proof of principle that this system can be used for testing the efficacy of chemotherapy agents. Dramatic and consistent regression of tumors in the CAM was induced by a single intravenous dose of doxorubicin administered to K562-engrafted embryos.

The inhibition of the antiapoptotic Bcl-2 proteins is an attractive strategy for either restoring normal apoptotic process in cancer cells or making these cells more susceptible to conventional chemotherapy. We studied the effect of Bcl-2 inhibitors on the viability of cells from CLL and other mature B-cell neoplasms. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We studied the cytotoxic effects of four nonpeptidic cell-permeable Bcl-2 inhibitors (HA14-1, antimycin A, GX15-003, and GX15-070) on B cells from patients with CLL, mantle cell lymphoma (MCL), and splenic marginal zone lymphoma (SMZL). Moreover, we analyzed the effect of these inhibitors in combination with fludarabine or chlorambucil. RESULTS: HA14-1 induced apoptosis with an EC50 lower than 50 microM in 26 of the 36 CLL samples analyzed. The mean EC50 for these sensitive patients was 23 +/- 2 microM. Antimycin A induced apoptosis in 13 of the 18 CLL samples analyzed. Both HA14-1 and antimycin A induced cytochrome c release from mitochondria and caspase-3 activation. Moreover, HA14-1 induced apoptosis in peripheral cells from MCL and SMZL. HA14-1 also induced apoptosis in CLL samples with alterations in p53 or ATM. Finally, GX compounds induced apoptosis in B cells from 9 of the 11 CLL samples tested. The combination of either HA14-1, antimycin A, or GX compounds with fludarabine or chlorambucil had additive cytotoxic effects on CLL cells.

Plasmacytoid dendritic cells (PDC) represent a newly identified kind of DC with specialized functions aimed at fighting against viral infections. Recently, we have shown that CD4+CD56+ malignancies were leukemia arising from PDC, with a particularly aggressive clinical course. Hence, we asked whether these malignant PDC could be killed via TRAIL, a death-inducing ligand that belongs to a new class of anticancer drugs currently under development. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this study we used a PDC line (GEN2.2) we recently developed from leukemic PDC as a model. RESULTS: We show that GEN2.2 PDC are sensitive to TRAIL-induced apoptosis and can be killed in vitro by TRAIL-expressing NK cells. Our results suggest that TRAIL binds to Death Receptor 5 (DR5) expressed by GEN2.2 and induces apoptosis mainly via caspases 10, 8, and 3. Interestingly, during infection with influenza, DR5 decreases on GEN2.2 cell surface, which consequently become resistant to TRAIL-induced apoptosis. Moreover, we confirmed the expression of DR5 or DR4 on half of LPDC tested, suggesting the possibility to kill these cells via TRAIL. Hopefully, normal PDC expressed neither DR4 nor DR5.

Recent experimental data suggests that the Hedgehog pathway may play a role in early hematopoiesis and angiogenesis. Stem cell leukemia (SCL), a basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factor, is essential for the specification and function of the hemangioblast. SCL expression in early hematopoietic precursors and endothelium is directed by a 3' enhancer. We hypothesized that the SCL 3' enhancer is regulated by Hedgehog signaling during specification of mesoderm towards hemangioblastic fate. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Whole embryos derived from transgenic mouse lines carrying reporter genes under the regulation of SCL 3' enhancer were cultured in the presence of active Hedgehog peptide. Hedgehog transcriptional regulation of SCL 3' enhancer was studied by in vitro and in vivo binding and reporter assays. RESULTS: Hedgehog induced expansion of cells in which the SCL 3' enhancer was transcriptionally activated. A Gli-binding site within the 3' enhancer of SCL was identified and Gli1 was demonstrated to bind and transactivate this enhancer in a sequence-dependent manner. We further demonstrated that the core region of the SCL 3' enhancer is transcriptionally regulated by Hedgehog in-vivo and that the Gli-binding site located in this enhancer is essential for Hedgehog transcriptional regulation in vitro. CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that SCL may be a direct target of Hedgehog signaling during hemangioblast specification.","['Hochman, Eldar', 'Kinston, Sarah', 'Harmelin, Alon', 'Gottgens, Berthold', 'Izraeli, Shai']","['Hochman E', 'Kinston S', 'Harmelin A', 'Gottgens B', 'Izraeli S']","[""The Research Section of Pediatric Malignancies, The Sheba Cancer Research Center, Safra Children's Hospital, Sheba Medical Center and Faculty of Medicine, Tel-Aviv University, Tel Hashomer, Israel.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,"['0 (Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors)', '0 (Gli1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Hedgehog Proteins)', '0 (Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1)', '0 (Tal1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Zinc Finger Protein GLI1)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors/*genetics/metabolism', 'Binding Sites', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Embryonic Stem Cells/metabolism', 'Enhancer Elements, Genetic/drug effects/*genetics', 'Hedgehog Proteins/pharmacology/*physiology', 'Hematopoiesis/*physiology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects/*physiology', 'T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1', 'Zinc Finger Protein GLI1']",,2006/12/13 09:00,2007/12/06 09:00,['2006/12/13 09:00'],"['2006/04/12 00:00 [received]', '2006/06/27 00:00 [revised]', '2006/07/31 00:00 [accepted]', '2006/12/13 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/12/06 09:00 [medline]', '2006/12/13 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0301-472X(06)00460-7 [pii]', '10.1016/j.exphem.2006.07.019 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Hematol. 2006 Dec;34(12):1643-50. doi: 10.1016/j.exphem.2006.07.019.,,,,,,,['G0800784/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom'],,,,,,,,,,,,

It is recognized that there is accelerated telomere shortening in blood cells of children with DS similar to that in conditions such as Fanconi anemia and dyskeratosis congenita. The latter conditions are associated with stem cell deficiency and clonal change, including acute myeloid leukemia. In this study we address the questions 1) whether the accelerated telomere shortening is associated with progenitor/stem cell deficiency in individuals with DS, predisposing to clonal change and 2) whether the occurrence of reduced numbers of stem/progenitor cells precede the incidence of mutations in exon 2 of GATA-1. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Peripheral blood from fetuses (23-35 weeks gestation) and/or bone marrow from children affected by DS and age-matched hematologically healthy controls were analyzed for telomere length, content of stem/progenitor cells, and mutations in exon 2 of GATA-1. RESULTS: We found that hematopoietic stem/progenitor cell deficiency and telomere shortening occurs in individuals with DS in fetal life. Moreover, the presence of a low number of progenitor cells was not associated with mutations in exon 2 of GATA-1. CONCLUSIONS: We propose that stem cell deficiency may be a primary predisposing event to DS leukemia development.","['Holmes, Denise K', 'Bates, Nicola', 'Murray, Mary', 'Ladusans, E J', 'Morabito, Antonino', 'Bolton-Maggs, Paula H B', 'Johnston, Tracey A', 'Walkenshaw, Steve', 'Wynn, Robert F', 'Bellantuono, Ilaria']","['Holmes DK', 'Bates N', 'Murray M', 'Ladusans EJ', 'Morabito A', 'Bolton-Maggs PH', 'Johnston TA', 'Walkenshaw S', 'Wynn RF', 'Bellantuono I']","[""Stem Cell Research Group, Royal Manchester Children's Hospital, Manchester, UK.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,['0 (GATA1 Transcription Factor)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Down Syndrome/*genetics/*pathology', 'Exons', 'Fetus', 'GATA1 Transcription Factor/genetics', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/metabolism/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Mutation', 'Telomere/genetics']",,2006/12/13 09:00,2007/12/06 09:00,['2006/12/13 09:00'],"['2006/10/13 00:00 [received]', '2006/10/13 00:00 [revised]', '2006/10/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2006/12/13 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/12/06 09:00 [medline]', '2006/12/13 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0301-472X(06)00664-3 [pii]', '10.1016/j.exphem.2006.10.013 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Hematol. 2006 Dec;34(12):1611-5. doi: 10.1016/j.exphem.2006.10.013.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Two distantly related gammaretroviruses, murine leukemia virus (MLV) and spleen necrosis virus (SNV), were used as a model system because SNV proteins can support MLV vector replication. Using chimeric or mutant Gag proteins that could not efficiently support MLV vector replication, we determined that a homologous capsid (CA) domain was necessary for the functional complementation of MLV and SNV Gag proteins. Findings from the bimolecular fluorescence complementation assay revealed that MLV and SNV Gag proteins were capable of colocalizing and interacting in cells. Taken together, our results indicated that MLV and SNV Gag proteins can interact in cells; however, a homologous CA domain is needed for functional complementation of MLV and SNV Gag proteins to complete virus replication.

RA has since been evaluated for treatment of other cancers, revealing variable effectiveness. The observation that expression of enzymes involved in RA biosynthesis is suppressed during tumorigenesis suggests that intra-tumor depletion in RA levels may contribute to tumor development and argues for the use of retinoids in cancer treatment.

RESULTS: The expression level of TIMP-2 on the cell membrane of the SHI-1/TIMP-2 cells was 99.3% +/- 0.1%, significantly higher than that of the SHI-1/MSCV cells (85.9% +/- 2.6%, P < 0.05). The A values 24, 48, 72, and 96 hours later of the SHI-1/TIMP-2 cells were 0.34 +/- 0.05, 0.6 +/- 0.05, 0.97 +/- 0.12, and 1.28 +/- 0.06 respectively, all significantly higher than those of the SHI-1/MSCV cells (0.28 +/- 0.03, 0.36 +/- 0.03, 0.54 +/- 0.09, and 0.99 +/- 0.03 respectively, all P < 0.05). The SHI-1/TIMP-2 cells and SHI-1/MSCV cells only could not migrate through Matrigel basically. 24 - 48 hours after co-cultivation Shi-1 cells began to appear in the lower layer of Transwell chambers, 72 hours later the trans-Matrigel SHI-1/TIMP-2 cells accounted for 24.7% +/- 6.9% of the inoculated SHI-1/TIMP-2 cells, a proportion significantly higher than that in the case of the SHI-1/MSCV cells (12% +/- 1.4%, P < 0.05). 24 days after the inoculation the mean body weight of the mice inoculated with SHI-1/TIMP-2 cells was 21.5 g +/- 0.4 g, significantly higher than that of the mice inoculated with SHI-1/MSCV cells (17.4 g +/- 0.6 g, P < 0.01). The mice inoculated with SHI-1/TIMP-2 cells showed much more tumors in different organs and much more severe infiltration in the CNS in comparison with the mice inoculated with SHI-1/MSCV cells The mean survival time of the mice inoculated with the SHI-1/TIMP-2 cells was 33.7 days, significantly shorter than that of the mice inoculated with SHI-1/MSCV cells (40 days). CONCLUSION: TIMP-2 expressed on the cell membrane is critical to promote the proliferation and infiltration of SHI-1 cells.","['Li, Zhen-jiang', 'Chen, Zi-xing', 'Cen, Jian-nong', 'He, Jun']","['Li ZJ', 'Chen ZX', 'Cen JN', 'He J']","['Jiangsu Institute of Hematology, First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, Suzhou, China.']",['chi'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,China,Zhonghua Yi Xue Za Zhi,Zhonghua yi xue za zhi,7511141,['127497-59-0 (Tissue Inhibitor of Metalloproteinase-2)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Membrane/*metabolism', '*Cell Proliferation', 'Cell Survival', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Experimental/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Leukemia, Monocytic, Acute/genetics/*metabolism/*pathology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Nude', 'Neoplasm Invasiveness', 'Neoplasm Transplantation/methods', 'Tissue Inhibitor of Metalloproteinase-2/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Transfection', 'Transplantation, Heterologous']",,2006/12/13 09:00,2008/04/25 09:00,['2006/12/13 09:00'],"['2006/12/13 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/04/25 09:00 [medline]', '2006/12/13 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Zhonghua Yi Xue Za Zhi. 2006 Sep 12;86(34):2409-12.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Patients with undifferentiated or monocytic AML, ALL, MMM, MDS and CML had no significantly altered GFI1B expression, whereas GFI1B expression was decreased 10-fold in patients with SAA (P < 0.0001 compared with controls). Silencing GFI1B by transfection with small interfering RNA (siRNA) markedly reduced the proliferation rate in the leukaemic cell lines HEL, K562 and NB4 (P < 0.01). Concomitantly, we observed a two- to threefold increase in the apoptosis rate in these cells after transfection with siRNA towards GFI1B. Our data indicate that GFI1B plays a major role in AML-M6 and AML-M7 and qualifies as a target for anti-leukaemic strategies in these malignancies.","['Elmaagacli, Ahmet H', 'Koldehoff, Michael', 'Zakrzewski, Johannes L', 'Steckel, Nina K', 'Ottinger, Hellmut', 'Beelen, Dietrich W']","['Elmaagacli AH', 'Koldehoff M', 'Zakrzewski JL', 'Steckel NK', 'Ottinger H', 'Beelen DW']","['Department of Bone Marrow Transplantation, University Hospital of Essen, Essen, Germany. ahmet.elmaagacli@uni-essen.de']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20061208,England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (GFI1B protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (rho GTP-Binding Proteins)']",IM,"['Anemia, Aplastic/metabolism', 'Antigens, CD34/immunology', 'Apoptosis', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cell Cycle', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Gene Expression', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Genes, myc', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia/immunology/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Megakaryoblastic, Acute/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'RNA Interference', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'RNA, Small Interfering/genetics', 'Repressor Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Statistics, Nonparametric', 'Transfection/methods', 'rho GTP-Binding Proteins/genetics']",,2006/12/13 09:00,2007/03/29 09:00,['2006/12/13 09:00'],"['2006/12/13 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/03/29 09:00 [medline]', '2006/12/13 09:00 [entrez]']","['BJH6407 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1365-2141.2006.06407.x [doi]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2007 Jan;136(2):212-9. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.2006.06407.x.

Recently, there has been a growing interest in Wnt signalling in several aspects of cellular development, including cancer formation. Little is known about Wnt signalling in B-ALL. We investigated whether activation of canonical Wnt signalling could occur in B-ALL cells and thereby play a potential role in cellular growth and/or survival. This study found that Wnt3A induced beta-catenin accumulation in both primary B-ALL cells and B-ALL leukaemia cell lines. Further, Wnt3A was shown to induce nuclear translocation of beta-catenin and TCF/Lef-1 dependent transcriptions in the B-ALL cell line Nalm-6. Examination of the mRNA expression pattern of WNT ligands, FZD receptors and WNT antagonists in Nalm-6 cells identified a set of ligands and receptors available for signalling, as well as antagonists potentially available for modulating the response. Functional analyses showed that Wnt3A inhibited the proliferation of several, but not all, B-ALL cell lines studied. Finally, microarray analysis was used to identify several Wnt3A target genes involved in a diverse range of cellular activities, which are potential mediators of the Wnt3A-restrained proliferation.","['Nygren, Marit Kveine', 'Dosen, Guri', 'Hystad, Marit E', 'Stubberud, Heidi', 'Funderud, Steinar', 'Rian, Edith']","['Nygren MK', 'Dosen G', 'Hystad ME', 'Stubberud H', 'Funderud S', 'Rian E']","['Department of Immunology, Institute for Cancer Research, The University Clinic Rikshospitalet-Radiumhospitalet HF, Montebello, Oslo, Norway.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20061208,England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (WNT3A protein, human)', '0 (WNT5A protein, human)', '0 (Wnt Proteins)', '0 (Wnt-5a Protein)', '0 (Wnt3 Protein)', '0 (Wnt3A Protein)', '0 (beta Catenin)']",IM,"['Blotting, Western/methods', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Humans', 'Microscopy, Confocal', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Signal Transduction/*physiology', 'Statistics, Nonparametric', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Wnt Proteins/genetics/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Wnt-5a Protein', 'Wnt3 Protein', 'Wnt3A Protein', 'beta Catenin/genetics/metabolism']",,2006/12/13 09:00,2007/03/30 09:00,['2006/12/13 09:00'],"['2006/12/13 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/03/30 09:00 [medline]', '2006/12/13 09:00 [entrez]']","['BJH6442 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1365-2141.2006.06442.x [doi]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2007 Feb;136(3):400-13. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.2006.06442.x.

T-LGL presents with cytopenias, often accompanied by autoimmune diseases, suggesting clonal transformation arising from an initially polyclonal immune response. Various immunogenetic predisposition factors, previously described for both immune-mediated bone marrow failure and autoimmune conditions, may promote T-LGL evolution and/or development of cytopenias. The association of T-LGL was analysed with a number of immunogenetic factors in 66 patients, including human leucocyte antigen (HLA) and killer-cell immunoglobulin-like receptor (KIR) genotype, KIR/KIR-L mismatch, CTLA-4 (+49 A/G),CD16-158V/F, CD45 polymorphisms, cytokine single nucleotide polymorphisms including: TNF-alpha (-308G/A), TGF-beta1 (codons 10 C/T, 25 G/C), IL-10 (-1082 G/A), IL-6 (-174 C/G), and IFN-gamma(+874 T/A). A statistically significant increase in A/A genotype for TNF-alpha-308, IL-10-1082, andCTLA-4 +49 was observed in T-LGL patients compared with control, suggesting that the G allele serves a protective role in each case. No association was found between specific KIR/HLA profile and disease. KIR/KIR-L analysis revealed significant mismatches between KIR3DL2 and KIR2DS1 and their ligands HLA-A3/11 and HLA-C group 2 (P = 0.03 and 0.01 respectively); the biological relevance of this finding is questionable.

Intravenous HHT has demonstrated activity in patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) after failure with interferon. METHODS: A Phase I study was completed of subcutaneous (s.c.) HHT in patients with CML in accelerated or blast phases and demonstrated efficacy and good tolerance at the same doses used by intravenous (i.v.) administration. The maximal tolerated dose (MTD) was 1.25 mg/m(2) s.c. twice daily. The cohort was then expanded to treated at the MTD to include patients in late chronic phase CML after imatinib failure. Therapy consisted of an i.v. loading dose of HHT 2.5 mg/m(2) over 24 hours, followed by 1.25 mg/m(2) s.c. twice daily for 14 days every 28 days until remission, then for 7 days every 28 days. Six patients (median age, 53 years) who had failed imatinib were treated and 5 were evaluable. Patients received a median of 4.5 courses of s.c. HHT. RESULTS: Complete hematologic remission was obtained in all 5 evaluable patients and 3 had cytogenetic (CG) responses: 1 complete and 2 minor. The 2 patients with BCR-ABL kinase domain mutations at the start of therapy with HHT had a CG response and in both instances the mutations became undetectable. All patients developed myelosuppression and 3 had their HHT dose reduced due to prolonged neutropenia. Nonhematologic toxicity was mild and manageable.

METHODS: The TPMT activity and gene polymorphisms were determined in an unrelated population of 250 Chinese healthy blood donors, 100 cords blood and 280 patients with acute leukemia. The TPMT genotyping assay was based on polymerase chain reaction (PCR), restriction digestion of PCR products, denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography (DHPLC) and SNaPshot sequencing and direct DNA sequencing in the TPMT exon 5 (G238C), TPMT exon7 (G460A) and TPMTexon10 (A719G). Erythrocyte TPMT activity was measured by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). RESULTS: The frequency of TPMT polymorphism in 250 Chinese healthy blood donors, 100 cords blood and 280 patients with acute leukemia was low (3.5%), and all the varied alleles were TPMT* 3C (exon 10A719G). All of them were TPMT* 1/TPMT* 3C heterozygote. The TPMT activity was between 6 and 12 U. The activity in 95.1% was more than 12 U (13 - 32 U), while the activity in others (4.9%) was 6 - 12 U. TPMT activity and genotype were concordant. Of 630 subjects evaluated, TPMT activity of heterozygous individuals in Chinese healthy blood donors, cords blood and acute leukemia patients were 9.1 U, 9.3 U and 9.07 U, respectively, significantly lower than that in general population (17.6 U, 17.67 U and 18.6 U, respectively). In the samples analyzed, ten subjects with heterozygous phenotypes (6/15 acute leukemia children and 4/16 healthy blood donors and cords blood) did not have TPMT* 2, TPMT* 3A or TPMT* 3C. Therefore, other factors may affect on TPMT activity. CONCLUSION: TPMT gene polymorphisms and its activity were concordant. The heterozygotes had low TPMT activity. Therefore, detection of TPMT genotype and its activity is useful. These findings hold a promise of improving the safety and efficacy of thiopurines therapy.","['Ma, Xiao-Li', 'Wu, Min-Yuan', 'Hu, Ya-Mei', 'Zu, Ping', 'Li, Zhi-Gang']","['Ma XL', 'Wu MY', 'Hu YM', 'Zu P', 'Li ZG']","[""Beijing children's Hospital, Capital University of Medical Sciences, Beijing 100045, China. mxl1123@sina.com""]",['chi'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",,China,Zhonghua Zhong Liu Za Zhi,Zhonghua zhong liu za zhi [Chinese journal of oncology],7910681,"['EC 2.1.1.- (Methyltransferases)', 'EC 2.1.1.67 (thiopurine methyltransferase)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Child', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Erythrocytes/enzymology', 'Exons', 'Female', 'Fetal Blood/enzymology', 'Genotype', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/blood/enzymology/*genetics', 'Male', 'Methyltransferases/blood/*genetics', '*Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide']",,2006/12/13 09:00,2008/02/05 09:00,['2006/12/13 09:00'],"['2006/12/13 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/02/05 09:00 [medline]', '2006/12/13 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Zhonghua Zhong Liu Za Zhi. 2006 Jun;28(6):456-9.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: The shRNA expression vector was constructed by gene recombination, then transfected into the cultured K562/A02 cells. The transcription of MDR1 gene was detected by semi-quantitative RT-PCR and the expression level of P-gp was determined by Western blot. 50% inhibition concentration (IC50) of ADM in K562/A02 cells was determined by MTT method. The intracellular doxorubicin (ADM) concentration was determined by HPLC. RESULTS: The introduction of pEGFP-C1/U6/MDR1-A or pEGFP-C1/U6/MDR1-B expression vector was shown to efficiently and specifically inhibit the expression of P-gp according to results of Western blot, with an inhibitory rate of 50.67%. Semi-quantitative RT-PCR showed that mRNA transcription of MDR1 gene was reduced by (48.2 +/- 2.5)%. On the contrast, the control plasmid did not exhibit inhibitory effect on the protein expression and mRNA transcription of MDR1. The relative efficiency of K562/A02 to ADM was 40.8% or 62.4%, respectively, and the intracellular accumulation of ADM increased after shRNA treatment. CONCLUSION: The shRNA expression vector targeting MDR1 gene showed dramatic inhibition on RNA transcription and protein expression.

Hierarchical cluster analysis clearly separated SCL and LCL and the small and large cell compartments of ComL. Likewise, cluster analysis with all samples of SCL, LCL, and ComL yielded two main 'small cell' and 'large cell' branches. Furthermore, 60 genes were differentially expressed between SCL and LCL, and 82 genes between the small and large cell components of ComL; 26 genes were discriminators in both settings. Use of the profiles of ComL as training sets for class prediction resulted in 95% accuracy for the classification of SCL and LCL.

The involvement of chromatin modifications in transcriptional regulation is relatively well characterized, and the distinct patterns of chromatin transitions that guide the process are thought to be the result of a code on the histone proteins (histone code). In contrast to transcription, the intricate link between chromatin and responses to DNA damage has been given attention only recently. It is now emerging that specific ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling complexes (including the Ino80, Swi/Snf and RSC remodelers) and certain constitutive (methylation of lysine 79 of histone H3) and DNA damage-induced covalent histone modifications (the most well characterized being the rapid phosphorylation of histone H2A) facilitate responses to double-strand breaks. Indeed, evidence is already accumulating for a DNA repair-specific histone code. In this review, the recent advances in our understanding of the relationship between chromatin modifications and double-strand break signaling and repair is discussed.","['Karagiannis, T C', 'El-Osta, A']","['Karagiannis TC', 'El-Osta A']","['Molecular Radiation Biology, Trescowthick Research Laboratories, Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre, East Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20061207,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (Chromatin)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Histones)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (ATM protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated Proteins', 'Cell Cycle Proteins/genetics', 'Chromatin/*genetics', 'Chromosomes/genetics', '*DNA Breaks, Double-Stranded', '*DNA Repair', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics', 'Histones/genetics', 'Humans', 'Meiosis', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/genetics', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/genetics']",76,2006/12/08 09:00,2007/09/26 09:00,['2006/12/08 09:00'],"['2006/12/08 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/09/26 09:00 [medline]', '2006/12/08 09:00 [entrez]']","['2404478 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.leu.2404478 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2007 Feb;21(2):195-200. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2404478.

However, their mechanism of action remains unknown. We have studied the regulation of the proapoptotic BH3-only Bcl-2 interacting mediator of cell death (BIM) in CLL cells. We demonstrate that glucocorticoids upregulate BIM at protein and mRNA levels. We have investigated the ability of different survival signals, such as 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate (TPA), stromal cell-derived factor-1alpha (SDF-1alpha), interleukin 4 (IL-4) and B-cell receptor (BCR) activation, to influence the levels of BIM and its induction by glucocorticoids. TPA downregulates BIM(EL) by extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)-mediated BIM phosphorylation and further proteasome-mediated degradation. However, SDF-1alpha and BCR activation induce transient BIM phosphorylation, without protein degradation. Proteasome inhibitors do not modify the levels of BIM with respect to untreated cells. However, they induce apoptosis and inhibit TPA-induced BIM(EL) degradation, leading to its accumulation. In conclusion, the results implicate BIM in glucocorticoid-induced apoptosis in CLL cells. BIM(EL) phosphorylation through the ERK pathway targets the protein for proteasomal degradation.","['Iglesias-Serret, D', 'de Frias, M', 'Santidrian, A F', 'Coll-Mulet, L', 'Cosialls, A M', 'Barragan, M', 'Domingo, A', 'Gil, J', 'Pons, G']","['Iglesias-Serret D', 'de Frias M', 'Santidrian AF', 'Coll-Mulet L', 'Cosialls AM', 'Barragan M', 'Domingo A', 'Gil J', 'Pons G']","[""Departament de Ciencies Fisiologiques II, IDIBELL-Universitat de Barcelona, L'Hospitalet de Llobregat, Barcelona, Spain.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20061207,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (BCL2L11 protein, human)', '0 (Bcl-2-Like Protein 11)', '0 (Glucocorticoids)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', 'EC 3.4.25.1 (Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/drug effects/*genetics/metabolism', 'Bcl-2-Like Protein 11', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Glucocorticoids/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/pathology', 'Membrane Proteins/drug effects/*genetics/metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/drug effects/*genetics/metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'RNA, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,2006/12/08 09:00,2007/09/26 09:00,['2006/12/08 09:00'],"['2006/12/08 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/09/26 09:00 [medline]', '2006/12/08 09:00 [entrez]']","['2404483 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.leu.2404483 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2007 Feb;21(2):281-7. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2404483.

Imatinib inhibits this kinase, and in a short-term study was superior to interferon alfa plus cytarabine for newly diagnosed CML in the chronic phase. For 5 years, we followed patients with CML who received imatinib as initial therapy. METHODS: We randomly assigned 553 patients to receive imatinib and 553 to receive interferon alfa plus cytarabine and then evaluated them for overall and event-free survival; progression to accelerated-phase CML or blast crisis; hematologic, cytogenetic, and molecular responses; and adverse events. RESULTS: The median follow-up was 60 months. Kaplan-Meier estimates of cumulative best rates of complete cytogenetic response among patients receiving imatinib were 69% by 12 months and 87% by 60 months. An estimated 7% of patients progressed to accelerated-phase CML or blast crisis, and the estimated overall survival of patients who received imatinib as initial therapy was 89% at 60 months. Patients who had a complete cytogenetic response or in whom levels of BCR-ABL transcripts had fallen by at least 3 log had a significantly lower risk of disease progression than did patients without a complete cytogenetic response (P<0.001). Grade 3 or 4 adverse events diminished over time, and there was no clinically significant change in the profile of adverse events. CONCLUSIONS: After 5 years of follow-up, continuous treatment of chronic-phase CML with imatinib as initial therapy was found to induce durable responses in a high proportion of patients.

A common denominator of these rather disparate states is the production of the early, proinflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF) in significant quantities. Recent studies have shown that TNF may act as a neuromodulator in the hindbrain to produce malaise by potentiating visceral afferent signaling at the central processes of the vagus nerve. However, the mechanism by which TNF produces this signal amplification is not known. Our time-lapse calcium imaging studies of individual central vagal afferent varicosities in the caudal brainstem slice preparation show that, although TNF has minimal direct effects to elevate terminal intracellular calcium levels, TNF does potentiate the terminal afferent responses to other stimuli through a ryanodine-based, calcium-induced calcium release mechanism. Such a scheme may explain how TNF sensitizes visceral as well as somatosensory primary afferents.","['Rogers, Richard C', 'Van Meter, Montina J', 'Hermann, Gerlinda E']","['Rogers RC', 'Van Meter MJ', 'Hermann GE']","['Laboratory of Autonomic Neuroscience, Pennington Biomedical Research Center, Baton Rouge, Louisiana 70808, USA. rogersrc@pbrc.edu']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",,United States,J Neurosci,The Journal of neuroscience : the official journal of the Society for Neuroscience,8102140,"['0 (Ryanodine Receptor Calcium Release Channel)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Afferent Pathways/metabolism/physiology', 'Animals', 'Brain Stem/metabolism/physiology', 'Calcium/physiology', 'Female', 'Male', 'Rats', 'Rats, Long-Evans', 'Ryanodine Receptor Calcium Release Channel/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/*physiology', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/*physiology', 'Vagus Nerve/metabolism/*physiology']",,2006/12/08 09:00,2006/12/30 09:00,['2006/12/08 09:00'],"['2006/12/08 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/12/30 09:00 [medline]', '2006/12/08 09:00 [entrez]']","['26/49/12642 [pii]', '10.1523/JNEUROSCI.3530-06.2006 [doi]']",ppublish,J Neurosci. 2006 Dec 6;26(49):12642-6. doi: 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.3530-06.2006.,,,,,PMC6674848,,"['R01 DK056373/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'DK52142/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 DK052142/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'HD47643/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States', 'DK56373/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'R21 HD047643/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Among them, the viral transactivator Tax and posttranscriptional regulator Rex are well characterized, and both positively regulate HTLV-1 viral expression. Less is known about the other regulatory proteins encoded in this region of the provirus, including the recently discovered HBZ protein. HBZ has been shown to negatively regulate basal and Tax-dependent HTLV-1 transcription through its ability to interact with specific basic-leucine zipper (bZIP) proteins. In the present study, we found that HBZ reduces HTLV-1 transcription and virion production. We then characterized the interaction between HBZ and the cellular transcription factor CREB. CREB plays a critical role in Tax-mediated HTLV-1 transcription by forming a complex with Tax that binds to viral cyclic AMP-response elements (CREs) located within the viral promoter. We found that HBZ and CREB interact in vivo and directly in vitro, and this interaction occurs through the bZIP domain of each protein. We also found that CREM-Ia and ATF-1, which share significant homology in their bZIP domains with the bZIP domain of CREB, interact with HBZ-bZIP. The interaction between CREB and HBZ prevents CREB binding to the viral CRE elements in vitro and in vivo, suggesting that the reduction in HTLV-1 transcription by HBZ is partly due to the loss of CREB at the promoter. We also found that HBZ displaces CREB from a cellular CRE, suggesting that HBZ may deregulate CREB-dependent cellular gene expression.","['Lemasson, Isabelle', 'Lewis, Matthew R', 'Polakowski, Nicholas', 'Hivin, Patrick', 'Cavanagh, Marie-Helene', 'Thebault, Sabine', 'Barbeau, Benoit', 'Nyborg, Jennifer K', 'Mesnard, Jean-Michel']","['Lemasson I', 'Lewis MR', 'Polakowski N', 'Hivin P', 'Cavanagh MH', 'Thebault S', 'Barbeau B', 'Nyborg JK', 'Mesnard JM']","['East Carolina University, Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Brody School of Medicine, 600 Moye Blvd., Greenville, NC 27834, USA. lemassoni@ecu.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20061206,United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Basic-Leucine Zipper Transcription Factors)', '0 (Cyclic AMP Response Element-Binding Protein)', '0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (Viral Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Basic-Leucine Zipper Transcription Factors/chemistry/*genetics/metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Cyclic AMP Response Element-Binding Protein/*metabolism', 'Down-Regulation', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Viral', 'Gene Products, tax/metabolism', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Viral Proteins/*genetics/metabolism']",,2006/12/08 09:00,2007/03/21 09:00,['2006/12/08 09:00'],"['2006/12/08 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/03/21 09:00 [medline]', '2006/12/08 09:00 [entrez]']","['JVI.00480-06 [pii]', '10.1128/JVI.00480-06 [doi]']",ppublish,J Virol. 2007 Feb;81(4):1543-53. doi: 10.1128/JVI.00480-06.

Adult CT-1(-/-) mice exhibit neural deficits including the loss of preganglionic sympathetic neurons, but their autonomic and cardiac parameters have not been examined. We used these mice to determine if the absence of CT-1 or loss of preganglionic sympathetic input altered heart rate, left ventricular pressure, cardiac contractility (dP/dt), or cell death following ischemia-reperfusion. Basal heart rate was increased in CT-1(-/-) mice, and this difference was abolished by ganglionic block. Left ventricular pressure and dP/dt were unchanged. Dobutamine stimulated similar increases in heart rate and dP/dt in both genotypes, but ventricular pressure was significantly lower in CT-1 nulls. Cardiac expression of interleukin-6 (IL-6) mRNA was increased significantly in CT-1 null mice, while leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) mRNA was unchanged. Infarct size normalized to area at risk was no different in CT-1(-/-) mice (33.8+/-1.0% vs. 37.7+/-3.2% WT) 24h after ischemia-reperfusion. Induction of IL-6 mRNA after infarct was significantly abrogated in CT-1 null mice compared to wild-type mice, but LIF mRNA-induction remained significant in CT-1 null mice and might contribute to cardiac protection in the absence of CT-1.","['Gritman, Kurt', 'Van Winkle, Donna M', 'Lorentz, Christina U', 'Pennica, Diane', 'Habecker, Beth A']","['Gritman K', 'Van Winkle DM', 'Lorentz CU', 'Pennica D', 'Habecker BA']","['Department of Physiology and Pharmacology, Oregon Health and Science University, Portland, OR 97239, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20061205,England,Cytokine,Cytokine,9005353,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', 'AJ7U77BR8I (cardiotrophin 1)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Body Weight', 'Cytokines/*deficiency/genetics/*metabolism', '*Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Heart Injuries/genetics/metabolism/pathology/physiopathology', 'Heart Rate', 'Interleukin-6/*genetics', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/*genetics', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Myocardial Infarction/genetics/pathology', 'Organ Size', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics']",,2006/12/08 09:00,2007/02/28 09:00,['2006/12/08 09:00'],"['2006/04/24 00:00 [received]', '2006/10/06 00:00 [revised]', '2006/10/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2006/12/08 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/02/28 09:00 [medline]', '2006/12/08 09:00 [entrez]']","['S1043-4666(06)00293-6 [pii]', '10.1016/j.cyto.2006.10.004 [doi]']",ppublish,Cytokine. 2006 Oct;36(1-2):9-16. doi: 10.1016/j.cyto.2006.10.004.

For example, Epstein-Barr Virus is considered a cause of Burkitt's lymphoma and other immunosuppression related lymphomas, Hodgkin lymphoma, and nasopharyngeal cancer. Several other human herpesviruses have been linked to cancers but the totality of evidence is inconclusive. METHODS: We conducted a systematic sub-study from within an ongoing case control study of adult black South Africans to investigate the relationship between antibodies to six human herpesviruses and seven cancer groups that may be caused by infectious agents. Subjects had incident cancers of the oral cavity (n = 88), the cervix (n = 53), the prostate (n = 66), Hodgkin lymphoma (n = 83), non-Hodgkin lymphoma (n = 80), multiple myeloma (n = 94) or leukaemia (n = 203). For comparison, patients with other cancers (n = 95) or cardiovascular disease (n = 101) were randomly selected from within the study. Patients were interviewed and their blood was tested for IgG antibodies against HSV-1, HSV-2, VZV, EBV-EBNA, CMV and HHV-6 using enzyme linked immunosorbent assays. Because these viruses are highly prevalent in this population, optical density results from the assays were used as an indirect, quantitative measure of antibody level. RESULTS: There was significant variation in the mean log antibody measures for HSV-2, VZV, CMV and HHV-6 between the disease groups. However, none of the specific cancer groups had significantly higher mean log antibody measures for any of the viruses compared to either control group. In a more detailed examination of seven associations between cancers and herpesviruses for which there had been prior reports, two statistically significant associations were found: a decreasing risk of myeloid leukaemia and an increasing risk of oral cancer with increasing tertiles of antibodies against HHV-6 compared to all other patients (p-trend = 0.03 and 0.02, respectively). Odds ratios for the top tertile compared to the bottom tertile were 0.58 (95%CI 0.3-1.0) for myeloid leukaemia and 2.21 (95% CI 1.1-4.3) for oral cancer. CONCLUSION: In this population, using these tests for IgG, neither mean antibody measure nor high antibody measure against human herpesviruses 1-6 was strongly associated with any of the seven cancer groups. However, we may not have had sufficient power to detect weak associations or associations with a sub-type of cancer if they were present.","['Berrington de Gonzalez, A', 'Urban, M I', 'Sitas, F', 'Blackburn, N', 'Hale, M', 'Patel, M', 'Ruff, P', 'Sur, R', 'Newton, R', 'Beral, V']","['Berrington de Gonzalez A', 'Urban MI', 'Sitas F', 'Blackburn N', 'Hale M', 'Patel M', 'Ruff P', 'Sur R', 'Newton R', 'Beral V']","['Cancer Research UK Epidemiology Unit, University of Oxford, Richard Doll Building, Roosevelt Drive, Headington, Oxford, OX3 7LF, UK. aberring@jhsph.edu']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20060914,England,Infect Agent Cancer,Infectious agents and cancer,101276559,,,,,2006/12/08 09:00,2006/12/08 09:01,['2006/12/08 09:00'],"['2006/06/06 00:00 [received]', '2006/09/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2006/12/08 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/12/08 09:01 [medline]', '2006/12/08 09:00 [entrez]']","['1750-9378-1-2 [pii]', '10.1186/1750-9378-1-2 [doi]']",epublish,Infect Agent Cancer. 2006 Sep 14;1:2. doi: 10.1186/1750-9378-1-2.,,,,,PMC1635002,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The role that flow cytometry plays, however, extends beyond just diagnosis and classification. OBJECTIVE: To review and evaluate the current roles of flow cytometry in non-Hodgkin lymphoma, to compare it with immunohistochemistry, and to discuss its potential future applications in the molecular diagnostic era. DATA SOURCES: The information contained herein is derived from peer-reviewed articles on the subject published in the English-language medical literature during the years 1980 to 2005 that were identified using PubMed (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi, 1980-2005) search, various books and other sources on flow cytometry, and the author's personal experience of more than 10 years with flow cytometric analysis of lymphomas and leukemia using Becton-Dickinson (San Jose, Calif) and Beckman-Coulter (Miami, Fla) flow cytometers. STUDY SELECTION: Studies were selected based on adequate material and methods, statistically significant results, and adequate clinical follow-up. DATA EXTRACTION: The data from various sources were compared when the methods used were the same or similar and appropriate controls were included. Most of the studies employed 2-color, 3-color, or 4-color flow cytometers with antibodies from Becton-Dickinson, Beckman-Coulter, or DakoCytomation (Carpinteria, Calif). Results were evaluated from studies utilizing the same or similar techniques and flow cytometers. Only objective data analyses from relevant and useful publications were included for reporting and discussion. DATA SYNTHESIS: Flow cytometry serves a variety of roles in the field of lymphoma/leukemia including rapid diagnosis, proper classification, staging, minimal residual disease detection, central nervous system lymphoma detection, evaluation of prognostic markers, detection of target molecules for therapies, ploidy analysis of lymphoma cell DNA, and evaluation of multidrug-resistance markers. It offers many advantages in comparison to immunohistochemistry for the same roles and provides uses that are either not possible or not preferable by immunohistochemistry such as multiparameter evaluation of single cells and detection of clonality in T cells. CONCLUSIONS: By virtue of its ability to evaluate not only surface but also cytoplasmic and nuclear antigens, flow cytometry continues to enjoy widespread use in various capacities in lymphoma evaluation and treatment. Additional roles for flow cytometry are likely to be invented in the future and should provide distinctive uses in the molecular era.","['Kaleem, Zahid']",['Kaleem Z'],"['Pathology & Laboratory Research Medical Center, Kansas City, MO, USA. zkaleem@hotmail.com']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,Arch Pathol Lab Med,Archives of pathology & laboratory medicine,7607091,,IM,"['Clone Cells', 'Flow Cytometry/instrumentation/*methods', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry/methods', 'Immunophenotyping/*methods', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/genetics/immunology/*pathology']",106,2006/12/08 09:00,2006/12/23 09:00,['2006/12/08 09:00'],"['2006/05/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2006/12/08 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/12/23 09:00 [medline]', '2006/12/08 09:00 [entrez]']","['RA5-952 [pii]', '10.5858/2006-130-1850-FCAOLC [doi]']",ppublish,Arch Pathol Lab Med. 2006 Dec;130(12):1850-8. doi: 10.5858/2006-130-1850-FCAOLC.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In Italy, it was more prevalent in the past among rural populations of irrigated areas. OBJECTIVE: To determine the histopathologic alterations of the gastric and duodenal mucosa associated with the presence of Strongyloides stercoralis parasites. DESIGN: Fifteen cases of strongyloidiasis were observed in immunocompromised patients during a recent 6-year period in Italy. S. stercoralis was found histologically in gastric biopsies (10 cases), in a gastrectomy (1 case), and in duodenal biopsies (9 cases). In 5 cases the parasite was present both in gastric and duodenal biopsies. Four patients were affected by lymphoma, 2 by multiple myeloma, 2 by gastric carcinoma, 1 by chronic myeloid leukemia, 1 by sideroblastic anemia, 1 by colorectal adenocarcinoma, 1 by chronic idiopathic myelofibrosis, 1 by chronic gastritis, 1 by gastric ulcers, and 1 by rheumatoid arthritis in corticosteroid therapy. No patient was affected by human immunodeficiency virus infection. Strongyloidiasis was not clinically diagnosed. RESULTS: Histologic examination revealed several sections of S. stercoralis larvae, many eggs, and some adult forms. All the parasites were located in the gastric and/or the duodenal crypts. Eosinophils infiltrating into the lamina propria were found in all cases; their intensity was correlated with the intensity of the infection. CONCLUSIONS: Histologic diagnosis of strongyloidiasis must be taken into consideration when examining both gastric and duodenal biopsies in immunocompromised patients, to avoid the development of an overwhelming infection of the parasite, which is dangerous for the life of the patient.","['Rivasi, Francesco', 'Pampiglione, Silvio', 'Boldorini, Renzo', 'Cardinale, Loredana']","['Rivasi F', 'Pampiglione S', 'Boldorini R', 'Cardinale L']","['Department of Pathologic Anatomy and Forensic Medicine, Section of Pathological Anatomy, University of Modena and Reggio Emilia, Modena, Italy. rivasi@unimore.it']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Arch Pathol Lab Med,Archives of pathology & laboratory medicine,7607091,,IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Animals', 'Biopsy', 'Duodenal Diseases/parasitology/*pathology', 'Duodenum/parasitology/pathology', 'Female', 'Humans', '*Immunocompromised Host', 'Life Cycle Stages', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Stomach/parasitology/pathology', 'Stomach Diseases/parasitology/*pathology', 'Strongyloides stercoralis/*isolation & purification/physiology', 'Strongyloidiasis/parasitology/*pathology']",,2006/12/08 09:00,2006/12/23 09:00,['2006/12/08 09:00'],"['2006/05/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2006/12/08 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/12/23 09:00 [medline]', '2006/12/08 09:00 [entrez]']","['OA5-1167 [pii]', '10.5858/2006-130-1792-HOGADS [doi]']",ppublish,Arch Pathol Lab Med. 2006 Dec;130(12):1792-8. doi: 10.5858/2006-130-1792-HOGADS.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Geographic variations in cancer mortality rates in Spain are apparently linked to variations in solar ultraviolet (UV) irradiances and other factors. Cancer mortality rates for 48 continental Spanish provinces for 1978-1992 were used in linear regression analyses with respect to mortality rates for latitude (an index of solar UVB levels), skin cancer (an index of high cumulative UVB irradiance), melanoma (an index related to solar UV irradiance and several other factors) and lung cancer (an index of cumulative effects of smoking). The 9 cancers with mortality rates significantly correlated with latitude for 1 or both sexes were brain, gastric, melanoma, nonmelanoma skin cancer (NMSC), non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL), pancreatic, pleural, rectal and thyroid cancer. Inverse correlations with latitude were found for laryngeal, lung and uterine corpus cancer.

DESIGN: Observational pilot study. SETTING: A bone marrow transplant hematology-oncology unit in a private city hospital. SAMPLE: Data were collected on 14 patients who developed maculopapular rashes out of 127 patients who received high-dose chemotherapy (purposive sampling). METHODS: Observation of the distribution and nature of skin rashes in relation to chemotherapy, disease, adjuvant medications, and white blood cell counts. MAIN RESEARCH VARIABLES: Diseases, chemotherapy protocols and doses, adjuvant medications, and blood counts. FINDINGS: Skin reactions ranged from mild, scattered macular or maculopapular rashes to severe rashes. Patients newly diagnosed with acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) who received induction protocols containing cytarabine had the most rashes, affecting 6 of 11 patients (55%). No rashes were observed on patients treated with the protocol that included high-dose corticosteroids. Patients rarely had recurrence of the rash with further courses of chemotherapy. CONCLUSIONS: Cytarabine doses higher than 700 mg/m2 may be a cause of maculopapular skin rashes. Patients most at risk were those newly diagnosed with AML who received induction therapy. Corticosteroids may prevent the development of skin rashes. IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING: No useful nursing strategy exists to prevent, lessen the intensity of, or shorten the course of a delayed hypersensitivity rash. Knowing which patients are most at risk is useful to enable close monitoring and patient and staff education.","['Wright, Lynette G']",['Wright LG'],"['Bone Marrow Transplant Hematology-Oncology Unit, Wesley Hospital, Auchenflower, Australia. jlwright@bigpond.net.au']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20061127,United States,Oncol Nurs Forum,Oncology nursing forum,7809033,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*adverse effects', 'Drug Eruptions/*epidemiology/immunology/nursing', 'Drug Hypersensitivity/*epidemiology/immunology/nursing', 'Humans', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Neoplasms/*drug therapy/*epidemiology/nursing', 'Oncology Nursing', 'Pilot Projects', 'Prevalence', 'Risk Factors']",,2006/12/07 09:00,2007/01/04 09:00,['2006/12/07 09:00'],"['2006/12/07 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/01/04 09:00 [medline]', '2006/12/07 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1188/06.ONF.1095-1103 [doi]'],epublish,Oncol Nurs Forum. 2006 Nov 27;33(6):1095-103. doi: 10.1188/06.ONF.1095-1103.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Malignant T cells are insensitive to the antiproliferative effects of the interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma)/signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1) pathway because of the IGF-1-dependent internalization of the IFN-gammaR2 signaling chain. Here we show that human malignant T cells are also resistant to the growth inhibitory effect of both the IGF-1 receptor-specific inhibitor picropodophyllin (PPP) and retrovirus-mediated gene transfer of a dominant negative IGF-1 receptor. However, blockade of IGF-1 receptor perturbs IFN-gammaR2 internalization and induces its cell surface accumulation in malignant T cells. This allows the reinstatement of the IFN-gamma-induced STAT1 activation, a high expression of proapoptotic molecules, and the suppression of malignant T-cell growth both in vitro and in vivo in a severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) mouse model. These data indicate that the inhibition of IGF-1 signaling combined with IFN-gamma administration could be a promising approach to suppress the growth of neoplastic T cells resistant to each treatment on its own.","['Conti, Laura', 'Regis, Gabriella', 'Longo, Angela', 'Bernabei, Paola', 'Chiarle, Roberto', 'Giovarelli, Mirella', 'Novelli, Francesco']","['Conti L', 'Regis G', 'Longo A', 'Bernabei P', 'Chiarle R', 'Giovarelli M', 'Novelli F']","['Center for Experimental Research and Medical Studies (CERMS), San Giovanni Battista Hospital, Turin, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20061205,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Receptors, Interferon)', '0 (STAT1 Transcription Factor)', '0 (interferon receptor, type II)', '0F35AOI227 (picropodophyllin)', '67763-96-6 (Insulin-Like Growth Factor I)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor, IGF Type 1)', 'L36H50F353 (Podophyllotoxin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis', 'Cell Line, Tumor', '*Down-Regulation', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Insulin-Like Growth Factor I/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Interferon-gamma/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/*metabolism/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Podophyllotoxin/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Receptor, IGF Type 1/genetics/metabolism', 'Receptors, Interferon/metabolism', 'STAT1 Transcription Factor/metabolism', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Signal Transduction/*drug effects']",,2006/12/07 09:00,2007/04/03 09:00,['2006/12/07 09:00'],"['2006/12/07 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/04/03 09:00 [medline]', '2006/12/07 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)41860-9 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2006-07-034231 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2007 Mar 15;109(6):2496-504. doi: 10.1182/blood-2006-07-034231.

We analyzed the regulation of the Wnt/beta-catenin pathway in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and its role in the pathogenesis of the disease. We found that expression of the Wnt inhibitors sFRP1, sFRP2, sFRP4, sFRP5, WIF1, Dkk3, and Hdpr1 was down-regulated due to abnormal promoter methylation in ALL cell lines and samples from patients with ALL. Methylation of Wnt inhibitors was associated with activation of the Wnt-signaling pathway as demonstrated by the up-regulation of the Wnt target genes WNT16, FZ3, TCF1, LEF1, and cyclin D1 in cell lines and samples and the nuclear localization of beta-catenin in cell lines. Treatment of ALL cells with the Wnt inhibitor quercetin or with the demethylating agent 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine induced an inactivation of the Wnt pathway and induced apoptosis of ALL cells. Finally, in a group of 261 patients with newly diagnosed ALL, abnormal methylation of Wnt inhibitors was associated with decreased 10-year disease-free survival (25% versus 66% respectively, P < .001) and overall survival (28% versus 61% respectively, P = .001).

To further investigate this subset and its geographic distribution in the context of a country (Italy) with both continental and Mediterranean areas, 37 IGHV3-21 CLLs were collected out of 1076 cases enrolled by different institutions from Northern or Central Southern Italy. Of the 37 cases, 18 were identified as homologous (hom)HCDR3-IGHV3-21 CLLs and were found almost exclusively (16 of 18) in Northern Italy; in contrast, 19 nonhomHCDR3-IGHV3-21 cases were evenly distributed throughout Italy. Clinically, poor survivals were documented for IGHV3-21 CLLs as well as for subgroups of mutated and homHCDR3-IGHV3-21 CLLs. Negative prognosticators CD38, ZAP-70, CD49d, and CD79b were expressed at higher levels in homHCDR3 than nonhomHCDR3-IGHV3-21 cases. Differential gene expression profiling (GEP) of 13 IGHV3-21 versus 52 non-IGHV3-21 CLLs identified, among 122 best-correlated genes, TGFB2 and VIPR1 as down- and up-regulated in IGHV3-21 CLL cases, respectively. Moreover, GEP of 7 homHCDR3 versus 6 nonhomHCDR3-IGHV3-21 CLLs yielded 20 differentially expressed genes, with WNT-16 being that expressed at the highest levels in homHCDR3-IGHV3-21 CLLs.

Dysregulation of the mismatch repair (MMR) pathway has been found to occur in cell line models due to co-amplification of MSH3 as a coincident effect of DHFR amplification, acquired as a mechanism generating resistance to methotrexate (MTX). The increased levels of MSH3 perturbed MutSalpha function resulting in hypermutability and increased resistance to thiopurines, drugs whose cytotoxic effects are triggered by MutSalpha. The relevance of this phenomenon in clinical samples is unknown but is extremely pertinent in childhood acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) in which children are exposed for prolonged periods to both MTX and thiopurines such that a single amplification event involving both the DHFR and the MSH3 genes may cause chemotherapeutic resistance to both agents. Thus, we have generated a leukaemic cell line (PreB697) and a normal human lymphoblastoid cell line (TK6) that are resistant to a pharmacologically relevant dose of MTX and show that while increased DHFR levels result in MTX resistance, the associated increased levels of MSH3 are insufficient to perturb MutSalpha functionality, in terms of MMR capacity or 6-thioguanine sensitivity.

These viruses replicate in a wide range of cell types including human cells in vitro and they can cause both hematological and neurological disorders in feral as well as in the inbred laboratory mice. Since MuLV-A's also exhibit discrete interference and neutralization properties, the envelope proteins of these viruses have been extremely useful for studying virus-host cell interactions and as vehicles for transfer of foreign genes into a variety of hosts including human cells. However, the genomic structure of any of the several known MuLV-A's has not been established and the evolutionary relationship of amphotropic retroviruses to the numerous exogenous or endogenous MuLV strains remains elusive. Herein we present a complete genetic structure of a novel amphotropic virus designated MuLV-1313 and demonstrate that this retrovirus together with other MuLV-A's belongs to a distinct molecular, biological and phylogenetic class among the MuLV strains isolated from a large number of the laboratory inbred or feral mice. RESULTS: The host range of MuLV-1313 is similar to the previously isolated MuLV-A's except that this virus replicates efficiently in mammalian as well as in chicken cells. Compared to ENV proteins of other MuLV-A's (4070A, 1504A and 10A-1), the gp70 protein of MuLV-1313 exhibits differences in its signal peptides and the proline-rich hinge regions. However, the MuLV-1313 envelope protein is totally unrelated to those present in a broad range of murine retroviruses that have been isolated from various inbred and feral mice globally. Genetic analysis of the entire MuLV-1313 genome by dot plot analyses, which compares each nucleotide of one genome with the corresponding nucleotide of another, revealed that the genome of this virus, with the exception of the env gene, is more closely related to the biologically distinct wild mouse ecotropic retrovirus (Cas-Br-E) isolated from another region of the Southern California, than to any of the 15 MuLV strains whose full-length sequences are present in the GenBank. This finding was corroborated by phylogenetic analyses and hierarchical clustering of the entire genomic sequence of MuLV-1313, which also placed all MULV-A's in a genetically distinct category among the large family of retroviruses isolated from numerous mouse strains globally. Likewise, construction of separate dendrograms for each of the Gag, Pol and Env proteins of MuLV-1313 demonstrated that the amphotropic retroviruses belong to a phylogenetically exclusive group of gammaretroviruses compared to all known MuLV strains. CONCLUSION: The molecular, biological and phylogenetic properties of amphotropic retroviruses including MuLV-1313 are distinct compared to a large family of exogenously- or endogenously-transmitted ecotropic, polytropic and xenotropic MuLV strains of the laboratory and feral mice. Further, both the naturally occurring amphotropic and a biologically discrete ecotropic retrovirus of the Southern California wild mice are more closely related to each other on the evolutionary tree than any other mammalian gammaretrovirus indicating a common origin of these viruses. This is the first report of a complete genomic analysis of a unique group of phylogenetically distinct amphotropic virus.","['Howard, Thomas M', 'Sheng, Zhijuan', 'Wang, Mingwu', 'Wu, Yongchun', 'Rasheed, Suraiya']","['Howard TM', 'Sheng Z', 'Wang M', 'Wu Y', 'Rasheed S']","['Laboratory of Viral Oncology & Proteomics Research, Department of Pathology, Keck School of Medicine, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA 90032-3626, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20061205,England,Virol J,Virology journal,101231645,"['0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (Gene Products, env)', '0 (Gene Products, gag)', '0 (Gene Products, pol)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Chick Embryo', 'DNA, Viral/analysis', '*Evolution, Molecular', 'Gammaretrovirus/classification/*genetics', 'Gene Products, env/chemistry/genetics', 'Gene Products, gag/chemistry/genetics', 'Gene Products, pol/chemistry/genetics', 'Genome, Viral/*genetics', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*classification/*genetics/pathogenicity', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', '*Phylogeny', 'Rats', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA']",,2006/12/07 09:00,2007/02/17 09:00,['2006/12/07 09:00'],"['2006/11/18 00:00 [received]', '2006/12/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2006/12/07 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/02/17 09:00 [medline]', '2006/12/07 09:00 [entrez]']","['1743-422X-3-101 [pii]', '10.1186/1743-422X-3-101 [doi]']",epublish,Virol J. 2006 Dec 5;3:101. doi: 10.1186/1743-422X-3-101.,,,,,PMC1769482,,['R01EY12164-02/EY/NEI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,"['GENBANK/AF019230', 'GENBANK/AF053745', 'GENBANK/AF169256', 'GENBANK/AF411814', 'GENBANK/AY818896', 'GENBANK/D88386', 'GENBANK/J01998', 'GENBANK/J02255', 'GENBANK/K03363', 'GENBANK/M93134', 'GENBANK/U13766', 'GENBANK/U94692', 'GENBANK/X02794', 'GENBANK/X57540', 'GENBANK/Z11128']",,,,,,,

But this may be more of an artifact of how we diagnose this condition than a reflection of its true prevalence. One area in which one might suspect this to be true is in postsurgical states. While there are case reports of sympathetically maintained pain occurring after radical neck dissection, orbital and maxillary exenteration, it has not been reported in the more common areas of postsurgical pain. For instance, although one should suspect that the nerve damage that accompanies post-thoracotomy and postmastectomy pain syndromes would bring into being a certain incidence of sympathetically maintained pain, it is difficult to find collaborative reports. This may have more to do with the difficulty inherent in diagnosing sympathetically maintained pain than its actual contribution to these persistent cancer pain syndromes. The reason that it is more commonly reported in limb amputation is less comprehensible since blocking the sympathetic fibers that travel to an extremity is easier than those going to the thoracic cavity. In addition to surgically induced sympathetically maintained pain, medical patients with lymphoma and leukemia may have an element of sympathetically maintained pain when they develop postherpetic neuralgia. While the contribution of sympathetically maintained pain in these cases is not totally ignored, its involvement, as in the surgical patients mentioned above, is worthy of another analysis. This paper will discuss the topics introduced above and suggest diagnostic and therapeutic options available for this condition.","['Wilsey, B', 'Teicheira, D', 'Caneris, O A', 'Fishman, S M']","['Wilsey B', 'Teicheira D', 'Caneris OA', 'Fishman SM']","['Department of Anesthesiology and Pain Medicine University of California, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Pain Pract,Pain practice : the official journal of World Institute of Pain,101130835,,,,,2006/12/07 09:00,2006/12/07 09:01,['2006/12/07 09:00'],"['2006/12/07 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/12/07 09:01 [medline]', '2006/12/07 09:00 [entrez]']","['PPR01032 [pii]', '10.1046/j.1533-2500.2001.01032.x [doi]']",ppublish,Pain Pract. 2001 Dec;1(4):307-23. doi: 10.1046/j.1533-2500.2001.01032.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: The expression of CD11b was analyzed by flow cytometry and nitroblue-tetrazolium (NBT) reduction assay was performed to determine the cell differentiation of APL cells. The expressions of c-Myc, ERK1/2, p38MAPK protein and the phosphorylation of ERK1/2, p38MAPK protein in NB4 cells were detected by Western blot assay. RESULTS: Ubenimex alone induced no significant changes in NBT reduction activity and CD11b expression but potentiated the differentiation induction activity of ATRA in APL cells. 100 microg/ml of ubenimex could enhance the NBT reduction activity induced by 10 nmol/L of ATRA, intensify the down-regulation of c-Myc protein expression and inhibit the phosphorylation of p38MAPK protein induced by 10 nmol/L of ATRA in NB4 cells.

METHODS: Bcr-abl cell lines( K562, MEG-01) and bcr-abl- cells lines( Jurkat, MCF-7 )were stained with PY20. Phosphotyrosine protein of K562 and MEG-01 cells was detected by flow cytometry before and after treatment with imatinib. Phosphotyrosine protein in bone marrow cells from 49 patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), Ph+ acute lymphoblastic leukemia(Ph(+) -ALL), Ph- ALL, acute myeloid leukemia (AML-M1, M2, M3, M5, FAB classification), chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CML) and 3 normal donor. Positive cells over 5% of total cells was considered positive cases for phosphotyrosine protein. The level of tyrosine phosphorylation was determined by median fluorescence intensity (MFI). RESULTS: Bcr-abl cell lines and marrow cells from 10 CML patients and 8 ALL patients were all PY20-positive, while bcr-abl- cell lines and marrow cells from 18 leukemia patients and 3 normal donor were all PY20-negative. MFI decreased remarkably after blocked by imatinib in K562 cells and MEG-01 cells. The positive cell percent of marrow cells from 10 newly diagnosed CML patients and 9 imatinib-sensitive CML patients was (54.20 +/- 19.82)% and (14.84 +/- 6.17)% (P < 0.05), while that of 2 cases of imatinib-resistant was 64.3% and 57.2%.

METHODS: Of the 35 CML patients, 26 were males and 9 were females, with a median age of 32 (12 - 50) years. 30 patients were in chronic phase of CML, 5 patients were in accelerated phase. Allo-HSCT from HLA identical siblings was performed for 35 patients, of whom 11 received bone marrow transplantation (BMT) and 24 peripheral blood stem cell transplantation (PBSCT). Conditioning regimens was TBI (total-body irradiation) + CY (CTX) protocol in 8 patients and BU/CY protocol in 27 patients. The average follow-up was 48 months (range 7 - 108 months). RESULTS: 34 (97.1%) patients were successfully engrafted. Among them, 21 patients (60.0%) had three years disease-free (DFS) survival. The overall 5-year survival (OS) was 57.1%. Two patients (5.7%) relapsed. Transplant-related mortality occurred in 12 patients. Hemorrhagic cystitis (HC) occurred in 5 patients and HVOD was observed in 1 patient. Acute graft-versus-host disease (aGVHD) occurred in 18 patients (51.4%), among them 7 patients (20.0%) were of grade III-IV. Chronic GVHD was in 17 patients (48.5%). There was no significant difference in 3-years DFS between BMT group and PBSCT group (54.5% vs. 62.5%, P > 0.05). The 3-year disease-free survival (DFS) was 42.9% in TBI/CY group and 55.6% in BU/CY group (P > 0.05). In univariate prognostic analysis model, the DFS at 3 years is 75% and 47.4% for < or =30 years patients and >30 years patients, respectively, P < 0.05. The 3-year DFS of patients with first chronic phase is higher than patients with advanced diseases (61.3% vs. 40%, P < 0. 05). The 3-year DFS in patients of grade I - II GVHD was higher than that in patients of grade III-IV GVHD (81.8% vs. 14.3%, P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: The patients who had transplantation done within 1 year after diagnosis during their first chronic phase of disease and who had low-grade GVHD have better prognosis. Those patients who had III-IV acute GVHD are prone to incorporate severe infection, which was a worse prognostic factor of allo-HSCT for chronic myelogenous leukemia.","['Tong, Xiu-Zhen', 'Li, Juan', 'Tan, En-Xun', 'Zhang, Guo-Cai', 'Wu, Xiang-Yuan', 'Peng, Ai-Hua', 'Zheng, Dong', 'Zou, Wai-Yi', 'Hong, Wen-De', 'Luo, Shao-Kai']","['Tong XZ', 'Li J', 'Tan EX', 'Zhang GC', 'Wu XY', 'Peng AH', 'Zheng D', 'Zou WY', 'Hong WD', 'Luo SK']","['Department of Hematology, the First Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou 510080, China.

METHODS: Purified HSP70 was combined into peptide complex (HSP70-Id) with the prepared Id-ScFv from B-CLL cells in vitro by using biochemical technique. The plastic-adherent monocytes from human peripheral blood were cultured and induced into DC with rhGM-CSF and rhIL-4 using cell culture and separation technique. The cultured DC were harvested and pulsed by HSP70-Id complex. DC morphology was observed under converted phase microscope and its phenotype was characterized by FCM on 8th day as well as their secreting cytokines were measured. Host lymphocytes were stimulated by DC loaded with HSP70-Id complex and co-cultured in the medium containing IL-2. The activation and proliferation of lymphocytes were examined by MTr test, which was also used to assay cytotoxicity of CTL elicited by modified DC to Daudi, K562 and HepG2 tumor cells, and FCM analyzed the changes of T lymphocyte subsets. RESULTS: Mature DCs were obtained successfully, showing typical morphology and phenotypic properties, the expression ratio of cellular surface molecules, CD1a was 20% - 30%, CD83 was more than 72% , both CD86 and HLA-DR over-expressed obviously in the complex-loaded DC group secreting cytokines of Thl type, IL-12 and TNF-alpha. The culturing lymphocytes that were activated by modified DC could more effectively and specifically kill Daudi (71. 24%), but not K562 and HepG2 tumor cells. Results of FCM assay demonstrated that percentage of CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocytes cocultured with complex-modified DC increased notably to 56.51% and 70.21%, respectively. CD4+ T/ CD8+ T proportion was changed from 1.49 to 0.81. The dose of peptide would be reduced to 1/50 if specific CTL induced by complex-modified DC instead of directly by peptide complex. CONCLUSION: DCs modified by HSP70-Id complex exhibit powerful biological activities, and could induce CTL to specific cytotoxicity against carcinoma cells. It might be produced by cooperation of CD4+ T, CD8+ T lymphocytes and DC. The results also suggested that DC modified by HSP70-Id complex can present antigen and induce CTL with high efficacy and specificity.","['Wang, Zhi-Hua', 'Ye, Qing', 'Hu, Zhi-Quan', 'Ye, Zhang-Qun', 'Yu, Xiao', 'Shen, Guan-Xin']","['Wang ZH', 'Ye Q', 'Hu ZQ', 'Ye ZQ', 'Yu X', 'Shen GX']","['Department of Urology, Tongii Hospital, Tongji Medical College of Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan 430030, China.']",['chi'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,China,Zhonghua Zhong Liu Za Zhi,Zhonghua zhong liu za zhi [Chinese journal of oncology],7910681,"['0 (HSP70 Heat-Shock Proteins)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Idiotypes)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Variable Region)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '207137-56-2 (Interleukin-4)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",IM,"['Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cells, Cultured', '*Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Dendritic Cells/cytology/drug effects/*immunology', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/pharmacology', 'HSP70 Heat-Shock Proteins/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Idiotypes/pharmacology', 'Immunoglobulin Variable Region/pharmacology', 'Interleukin-4/genetics/pharmacology', 'K562 Cells', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Monocytes/cytology/drug effects/immunology', 'Recombinant Proteins/pharmacology', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/*immunology']",,2006/12/07 09:00,2008/02/15 09:00,['2006/12/07 09:00'],"['2006/12/07 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/02/15 09:00 [medline]', '2006/12/07 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Zhonghua Zhong Liu Za Zhi. 2006 Jul;28(7):481-5.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To confirm the biological activity of ATP on human myeloid leukemic cells, F-36P and HL-60, cells were treated with a variety of concentrations of ATP. The stimulation with extracellular ATP induced the arrest of cell proliferation and cell death from the analysis of Annexin-V staining and caspase activity by flow cytometry. The Annexin-V positive cells in both cell lines were dramatically increased following ATP stimulation. The expression of P2 purinergic receptor genes was confirmed, such as P2X1, P2X4, P2X5, P2X7 and P2Y1, P2Y2, P2Y4, P2Y5, P2Y6, P2Y11 in both leukemic cell lines. Interestingly, ATP induced intracellular calcium flux in HL-60 cells but not in F-36P cells, as determined by Fluo-3 AM staining. Cell cycle analysis revealed that ATP treatment arrested both F-36P and HL-60 cells at G1/GO. Taken together, these data showed that extracellular ATP via P2 receptor genes was involved in the cell proliferation and survival in human myeloid leukemic cells, HL-60 and F-36P cells by the induction of apoptosis and control of cell cycle. Our data suggest that treatment with extracellular nucleotides may be a novel and powerful therapeutic avenue for myeloid leukemic disease.","['Yoon, Mi-Jung', 'Lee, Hae-Jin', 'Kim, Jae-Hwan', 'Kim, Dong-Ku']","['Yoon MJ', 'Lee HJ', 'Kim JH', 'Kim DK']","['Cell and Gene Therapy Research Institute, Graduate School of Life Science and Biotechnology, Pochon CHA University CHA General Hospital, Seoul 135-081, Korea.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Korea (South),Arch Pharm Res,Archives of pharmacal research,8000036,"['0 (Annexins)', '0 (P2RY2 protein, human)', '0 (Receptors, Purinergic P2)', '0 (Receptors, Purinergic P2Y2)', '0 (Tetrazolium Salts)', '0 (Thiazoles)', '8L70Q75FXE (Adenosine Triphosphate)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'EUY85H477I (thiazolyl blue)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Adenosine Triphosphate/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Annexins/metabolism', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Calcium/metabolism', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Colorimetry', 'Flow Cytometry', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*pathology', 'Receptors, Purinergic P2/drug effects', 'Receptors, Purinergic P2Y2', 'Signal Transduction/*drug effects', 'Tetrazolium Salts', 'Thiazoles']",,2006/12/07 09:00,2006/12/27 09:00,['2006/12/07 09:00'],"['2006/12/07 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/12/27 09:00 [medline]', '2006/12/07 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF02969288 [doi]'],ppublish,Arch Pharm Res. 2006 Nov;29(11):1032-41. doi: 10.1007/BF02969288.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The carbohydrate epitope of Neu5,9Ac(2)-GPs(ALL) was confirmed by using several synthetic sialic acid analogues. They are functionally active signaling molecules as demonstrated by their role in mediating lymphoproliferative responses and consequential increased production of IFN-gamma due to specific stimulation of Neu5,9Ac(2)-GPs on PBMC(ALL) with Achatinin-H. Cells devoid of 9-O-acetylations (9-O-AcSA(-)) revealed decreased nitric oxide production as compared to 9-O-AcSA(+) cells on exposure to IFN-gamma. Under this condition, a decrease in viability of 9-O-AcSA(-) cells as compared to 9-O-AcSA(+) cells was also observed which was reflected from increased caspase 3 activity and apoptosis suggesting the protective role of this glycotope. These Neu5,9Ac(2)-GPs are also capable of inducing disease-specific anti-Neu5,9Ac(2)-GPs antibodies in ALL children. Additionally, we have observed that disease-specific anti-Neu5,9Ac(2)-GPs have altered glycosylation profile, and they are incapable of exerting a few Fc-glycosylation-sensitive effector functions. These observations hint toward a disbalanced homeostasis, thereby enabling the cancer cells to escape host defense. Taken together, it may be hypothesized that Neu5,9Ac(2)-GPs and their antibodies play a prominent role in promoting the survival of lymphoblasts in ALL.","['Ghosh, Shyamasree', 'Bandyopadhyay, Suman', 'Mukherjee, Kankana', 'Mallick, Asish', 'Pal, Santanu', 'Mandal, Chhabinath', 'Bhattacharya, Dilip K', 'Mandal, Chitra']","['Ghosh S', 'Bandyopadhyay S', 'Mukherjee K', 'Mallick A', 'Pal S', 'Mandal C', 'Bhattacharya DK', 'Mandal C']","['Immunobiology Division, Indian Institute of Chemical Biology, 4 Raja S.C.

The development of the embryo begins with the fertilized ovum, a single totipotent cell which undergoes mitosis and gives rise to a multicellular structure named blastocyst. At the same time, increasing concentrations of ovarian steroid hormones initiate a complex signaling cascade that stimulates the differentiation of endometrial stromal cells to decidual cells, preparing the uterus to lodge the embryo. Studies in humans and in other mammals have shown that cytokines and growth factors are produced by the pre-implantation embryo and cells of the reproductive tract; however, the interactions between these factors that converge for successful implantation are not well understood. This review focuses on the actions of interleukin-1, leukemia inhibitory factor, epidermal growth factor, heparin-binding epidermal growth factor, and vascular endothelial growth factor, and on the network of their interactions leading to early embryo development, peri-implantatory endometrial changes, embryo implantation and trophoblast differentiation.

This method may therefore guide therapeutic decisions and should be investigated in a diagnostic setting in parallel to established standard methods.","['Haferlach, T', 'Kohlmann, A', 'Bacher, U', 'Schnittger, S', 'Haferlach, C', 'Kern, W']","['Haferlach T', 'Kohlmann A', 'Bacher U', 'Schnittger S', 'Haferlach C', 'Kern W']","['MLL Munich Leukemia Laboratory, Max-Lebsche-Platz 31, Munich 81377, Germany. torsten.haferlach@mll-online.com']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20061205,England,Br J Cancer,British journal of cancer,0370635,,IM,"['Acute Disease', '*Gene Expression Profiling', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*diagnosis/*genetics', 'Neoplasm, Residual/diagnosis/genetics', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis/*methods', 'Prognosis', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction/methods', 'Sensitivity and Specificity']",39,2006/12/06 09:00,2007/09/14 09:00,['2006/12/06 09:00'],"['2006/12/06 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/09/14 09:00 [medline]', '2006/12/06 09:00 [entrez]']","['6603495 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.bjc.6603495 [doi]']",ppublish,Br J Cancer. 2007 Feb 26;96(4):535-40. doi: 10.1038/sj.bjc.6603495.

Myc is known to inhibit differentiation of hematopoietic precursor cells, and here we report that PML promotes cell differentiation. We further demonstrate that PML and Myc form a complex in vivo. The interaction of the two proteins leads to the destabilization of Myc in a manner dependent on the really interesting new gene (RING) domain of PML. Although several PML isoforms are able to interact with Myc, the ability to destabilize Myc is specific for PML4. Importantly, the PML-induced destabilization resulted in a reduction of promoter-bound Myc on Myc-repressed genes. Thereby, PML induced the re-activation of Myc-repressed target genes including the tumor suppressive genes of the cell cycle inhibitors cdkn1a/p21 and cdkn2b/p15. Together, these results establish PML-mediated destabilization of Myc and the derepression of cell cycle inhibitor genes as an important regulatory mechanism that allows cell differentiation and prevents aberrant proliferation driven by uncontrolled Myc activity.","['Buschbeck, M', 'Uribesalgo, I', 'Ledl, A', 'Gutierrez, A', 'Minucci, S', 'Muller, S', 'Di Croce, L']","['Buschbeck M', 'Uribesalgo I', 'Ledl A', 'Gutierrez A', 'Minucci S', 'Muller S', 'Di Croce L']","['Centre de Regulacio Genomica (CRG)/PRBB and Universitat Pompeu Fabra, Barcelona, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20061204,England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (Protein Isoforms)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '1406-16-2 (Vitamin D)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)']",IM,"['*Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Granulocytes/cytology/drug effects/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Nuclear Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Isoforms/genetics/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc/genetics/*metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Vitamin D/pharmacology']",,2006/12/06 09:00,2007/06/19 09:00,['2006/12/06 09:00'],"['2006/12/06 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/06/19 09:00 [medline]', '2006/12/06 09:00 [entrez]']","['1210128 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.onc.1210128 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2007 May 17;26(23):3415-22. doi: 10.1038/sj.onc.1210128.

By this chromosomal translocation, a novel activated tyrosine kinase, BCR-ABL chimeric protein, is generated, and the protein is causative of the disease. Recently, Imatinib mesylate targeting to a BCR-ABL chimeric protein has been developed, and shown to achieve complete remission at a high rate. Patients are currently required to receive a fixed dose, 400 mg daily; however, it is possible that some of patients can maintain their remission with reduced doses of imatinib. In this study, we determined levels of BCR-ABL transcript in CML patients by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis, and explored the possibility of individualization of therapeutic doses of imatinib. Thirty-five CML patients, including 17 newly diagnosed patients, 16 patients pre-treated with interferon-alpha, and 2 relapsed patients after allogeneic transplantation, were treated with imatinib. Complete cytogenetic response was achieved in 31 (89%) patients. Major molecular response (MMR) was achieved in 21 (60%). Complete molecular response (CMR) was achieved in 7 (20%). Imatinib was discontinued in 2 patients, one patient with MMR due to noncompliance and other patient sustaining CMR, but both patients relapsed 7 and 13 months later, respectively. The doses of imatinib were reduced in 7 patients due to its side effects, but 4 out of the 7 patients have sustained MMR, and 2 of them have sustained CMR for more than 23 months.

Bolus intravenous (IV) troxacitabine regimens have shown significant activity in patients with refractory acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and preclinical data suggest that administration via continuous infusion may result in enhanced antitumor activity. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with refractory AML initially received troxacitabine 10.1 mg/m2 by continuous IV infusion (CIVI) for 48 hours. Infusion duration and daily dose were increased in subsequent patient cohorts. RESULTS: Forty-eight patients, median age 58 years (range, 21 to 81 years), were treated. Dose-limiting toxicities were mucositis and hand-foot syndrome, and 12.0 mg/m2/d for 5 days was established as the maximum-tolerated dose. Seven patients (15%) achieved complete remission (CR) or CR with incomplete platelet recovery (CRp), with a median survival among responders of 12 months. Steady-state concentrations of troxacitabine were found to be linearly and inversely proportionally related to calculated creatinine clearance at doses of 10.1 and 12.0 mg/m2/d. All patients responding to troxacitabine had steady-state serum drug concentration of more than approximately 80 ng/mL. In 27 patients achieving target troxacitabine plasma concentrations (ie, approximately 80 ng/mL) the CR + CRp rate was 26%. CONCLUSION: Troxacitabine administered as a CIVI allows a significant increase in dose-intensity in comparison to IV bolus regimens, has antileukemic activity, and warrants additional investigation in patients with refractory AML. The recommended phase II study dose is 12.0 mg/m2 daily CIVI for 5 days.","['Roboz, Gail J', 'Giles, Francis J', 'Ritchie, Ellen K', 'Allen-Bard, Sandra', 'Curcio, Tania J', 'Wilkes, Meredith A', 'Park, S Lani', 'Kantarjian, Hagop M', 'Faderl, Stefan', 'Ravandi, Farhad', 'Kelner, Michael J', 'Feldman, Eric J']","['Roboz GJ', 'Giles FJ', 'Ritchie EK', 'Allen-Bard S', 'Curcio TJ', 'Wilkes MA', 'Park SL', 'Kantarjian HM', 'Faderl S', 'Ravandi F', 'Kelner MJ', 'Feldman EJ']","['Weill Medical College of Cornell University, The New York Presbyterian Hospital, New York, NY 10021, USA. gar2001@med.cornell.edu']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial, Phase I', 'Clinical Trial, Phase II', 'Journal Article']",20061204,United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Dioxolanes)', '60KQZ0388Y (troxacitabine)', '8J337D1HZY (Cytosine)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*administration & dosage/*pharmacokinetics', 'Cytosine/administration & dosage/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacokinetics', 'Dioxolanes/*administration & dosage/*pharmacokinetics', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infusions, Intravenous', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Time Factors', 'Treatment Outcome']",,2006/12/06 09:00,2007/01/30 09:00,['2006/12/06 09:00'],"['2006/12/06 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/01/30 09:00 [medline]', '2006/12/06 09:00 [entrez]']","['JCO.2006.06.6209 [pii]', '10.1200/JCO.2006.06.6209 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2007 Jan 1;25(1):10-5. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2006.06.6209.

A multicenter phase II study of cloretazine was conducted in patients 60 years of age or older with previously untreated acute myeloid leukemia (AML) or high-risk myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). PATIENTS AND METHODS: Cloretazine 600 mg/m2 was administered as a single intravenous infusion. Patients were stratified by age, performance score, cytogenetic risk category, type of AML, and comorbidity. RESULTS: One hundred four patients, median age 72 years (range, 60 to 84 years), were treated on study. Performance status was 2 in 31 patients (30%) and no patient had a favorable karyotype. Forty-seven patients (45%) had cardiac disease, 25 patients (24%) had hepatic disease, and 19 patients (18%) had pulmonary disease, defined as per the Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation-Specific Comorbidity Index, at study entry. The overall response rate was 32%, with 29 patients (28%) achieving complete response (CR) and four patients (4%) achieving CR with incomplete platelet recovery. Response rates in 44 de novo AML patients, 45 secondary AML patients, and 15 high-risk MDS patients were 50%, 11%, and 40%, respectively. Response by cytogenetic risk category was 39% in 56 patients with intermediate cytogenetic risk and 24% in 46 patients with unfavorable cytogenetic risk. Nineteen (18%) patients died within 30 days of receiving cloretazine therapy. Median overall survival was 94 days, with a 1-year survival of 14%; the median duration of survival was 147 days, with a 1-year survival of 28% for those who achieved CR.

Toxin B from variant C. difficile strain 1470 serotype F (TcdBF) differs from TcdB with regard to substrate proteins, as it glucosylates Rac1 and R-Ras but not RhoA and Cdc42. In this study, we addressed the question of whether the cellular effects of the toxins depend on their protein substrate specificity. Rat basophilic leukemia (RBL) cells were synchronized using the thymidine double-block technique. We show that cells were most sensitive to the cytotoxic effect of TcdB in S phase, as analyzed in terms of phosphatidyl serine externalization, fragmentation of nuclei, and activation of caspase-3; in contrast, TcdBF induced only a marginal cytotoxic effect, suggesting that inactivation of RhoA (but not of Rac1) was required for the cytotoxic effect. The glucosylation of Rac1 was correlated to the cytopathic effect of either toxin, suggesting a close connection of the two effects. The cytotoxic effect of TcdB was executed by caspase-3, as it was responsive to inhibition by acetyl-Asp-Met-Gln-Asp-aldehyde (Ac-DMQD-CHO), an inhibitor of caspase-3. The viability of TcdB-treated RBL cells was reduced, whereas the viability of TcdBF-treated cells was unchanged, further confirming that inactivation of RhoA is required for the cytotoxic effect. In conclusion, the protein substrate specificity of the glucosylating toxins determines their biological activity.","['Huelsenbeck, Johannes', 'Dreger, Stefanie', 'Gerhard, Ralf', 'Barth, Holger', 'Just, Ingo', 'Genth, Harald']","['Huelsenbeck J', 'Dreger S', 'Gerhard R', 'Barth H', 'Just I', 'Genth H']","['Institut of Toxicology, Medical School, Hannover, D-30625 Hannover, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20061204,United States,Infect Immun,Infection and immunity,0246127,"['0 (Bacterial Proteins)', '0 (Bacterial Toxins)', '0 (Caspase Inhibitors)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Oligopeptides)', '0 (acetyl-aspartyl-methionyl-glutaminyl-aspartyl-aldehyde)', '0 (toxB protein, Clostridium difficile)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (cdc42 GTP-Binding Protein)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (rhoA GTP-Binding Protein)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (rhoB GTP-Binding Protein)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Bacterial Proteins/metabolism/*toxicity', 'Bacterial Toxins/metabolism/*toxicity', 'Basophils/*cytology/metabolism', 'Caspase 3/analysis', 'Caspase Inhibitors', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Shape', 'Cell Survival', 'Clostridioides difficile/classification/genetics/metabolism/*pathogenicity', 'DNA Fragmentation', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Glycosylation', 'Oligopeptides/pharmacology', 'Rats', 'cdc42 GTP-Binding Protein/metabolism', 'rhoA GTP-Binding Protein/metabolism', 'rhoB GTP-Binding Protein/metabolism']",,2006/12/06 09:00,2007/03/09 09:00,['2006/12/06 09:00'],"['2006/12/06 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/03/09 09:00 [medline]', '2006/12/06 09:00 [entrez]']","['IAI.01705-06 [pii]', '10.1128/IAI.01705-06 [doi]']",ppublish,Infect Immun. 2007 Feb;75(2):801-9. doi: 10.1128/IAI.01705-06.

These observations suggest that a DR-mediated pathway activated by JNK is involved in apoptosis induced by treatment with As(2)O(3) plus BSO.","['Chen, Duo', 'Chan, Rosemarie', 'Waxman, Samuel', 'Jing, Yongkui']","['Chen D', 'Chan R', 'Waxman S', 'Jing Y']","['Division of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Medicine, Mount Sinai School of Medicine, New York, New York 10029-6547, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",,United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Amino Acid Chloromethyl Ketones)', '0 (Anthracenes)', '0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (Caspase Inhibitors)', '0 (Oxides)', '0 (Receptors, TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand)', '0 (benzyloxycarbonylvalyl-alanyl-aspartyl fluoromethyl ketone)', '1TW30Y2766 (pyrazolanthrone)', '5072-26-4 (Buthionine Sulfoximine)', 'BBX060AN9V (Hydrogen Peroxide)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'GAN16C9B8O (Glutathione)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Chloromethyl Ketones/pharmacology', 'Anthracenes/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals/*pharmacology', 'Blotting, Western', 'Buthionine Sulfoximine/*pharmacology', 'Caspase 3/metabolism', 'Caspase Inhibitors', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Synergism', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Glutathione/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Hydrogen Peroxide/metabolism', 'JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Leukemia/metabolism/pathology', 'Lymphoma/metabolism/pathology', 'Oxides/*pharmacology', 'Receptors, TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand/*metabolism', 'Time Factors', 'U937 Cells']",,2006/12/06 09:00,2007/01/11 09:00,['2006/12/06 09:00'],"['2006/12/06 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/01/11 09:00 [medline]', '2006/12/06 09:00 [entrez]']","['66/23/11416 [pii]', '10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-06-0409 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 2006 Dec 1;66(23):11416-23. doi: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-06-0409.,,,,,,,['R01CA93533/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,

We have previously shown that AML1/MDS1/EVI1 (AME), a fusion gene generated by a t(3;21)(q26;q22) translocation found in patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia during blast phase, myelodysplastic syndrome, or acute myelogenous leukemia (AML), impairs hematopoiesis and eventually induces an AML in mice. Both fusion partners of AME, AML1 and MDS1/EVI1, encode transcription factors and are also targets of a variety of genetic abnormalities in human hematologic malignancies. In addition, aberrant expression of ectopic viral integration site 1 (EVI1) has also been found in solid tumors, such as ovarian and colon cancers. In this study, we examined whether ATO could target AME and related oncoproteins. We found that ATO used at therapeutic levels degrades AME. The ATO treatment induces differentiation and apoptosis in AME leukemic cells in vitro as well as reduces tumor load and increases the survival of mice transplanted with these cells. We further found that ATO targets AME via both myelodysplastic syndrome 1 (MDS1) and EVI1 moieties and degrades EVI1 via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway and MDS1 in a proteasome-independent manner. Our results suggest that ATO could be used as a part of targeted therapy for AME-, AML1/MDS1-, MDS1/EVI1-, and EVI1-positive human cancers.","['Shackelford, David', 'Kenific, Candia', 'Blusztajn, Agnieszka', 'Waxman, Samuel', 'Ren, Ruibao']","['Shackelford D', 'Kenific C', 'Blusztajn A', 'Waxman S', 'Ren R']","['Rosenstiel Basic Medical Sciences Research Center, Department of Biology, Brandeis University, Waltham, Massachusetts 02454-9110, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (AML1-MDS1-EVI1 fusion protein, human)', '0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Oxides)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (Ubiquitin)', 'EC 3.4.25.1 (Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals/*pharmacology', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit/genetics/*metabolism', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Down-Regulation/drug effects', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'Growth Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Experimental/genetics/pathology/prevention & control', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'NIH 3T3 Cells', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/genetics/*metabolism', 'Oxides/*pharmacology', 'Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex/metabolism', 'Repressor Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Survival Analysis', 'Transfection', 'Ubiquitin/metabolism']",,2006/12/06 09:00,2007/01/11 09:00,['2006/12/06 09:00'],"['2006/12/06 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/01/11 09:00 [medline]', '2006/12/06 09:00 [entrez]']","['66/23/11360 [pii]', '10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-06-1774 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 2006 Dec 1;66(23):11360-9. doi: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-06-1774.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, we provide evidence that Cbfbeta modulates the oncogenic function of this fusion protein.

To treat infertility secondary to anticancer treatment for childhood cancer, we have developed a procedure to isolate germ cells from leukemic mice by fluorescence-activated cell sorting with two surface markers, and transplantation of isolated germ cells successfully restored fertility without inducing leukemia. In the present study, we analyzed human germ cells and human malignant cells, including five leukemia cell lines and three lymphoma cell lines, by fluorescence-activated cell sorting with antibodies against MHC class I and CD45. Testicular specimens were obtained from a patient who underwent surgery for testicular rupture. In the high forward scatter and low side scatter region, no malignant cells were found in the MHC class I-negative and CD45-negative fraction (the germ cell fraction), with the exception of K562 cells. A total of 39.2% of the germ cells were found in the germ cell fraction. A total of 1.45% of K562 cells were found in the germ cell fraction. Treatment with IFNgamma induced the expression of MHC class I on K562 cells but not on germ cells and made it possible to isolate germ cells from K562 cells.

Imatinib mesylate, a selective inhibitor of BCR-ABL, represents current frontline therapy for CML; however, emerging evidence suggests that drug resistance to imatinib may limit its long-term success. To improve treatment options, dasatinib (BMS-354825) was developed as a novel, oral, multi-targeted kinase inhibitor of BCR-ABL and SRC family kinases. To date, dasatinib has shown promising anti-leukemic activity in preclinical models of CML and in phase I/II clinical studies in patients with imatinib-resistant or imatinib-intolerant disease. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: The pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic biomarkers of dasatinib were investigated in K562 human CML xenografts grown s.c. in severe combined immunodeficient mice. Tumoral levels of phospho-BCR-ABL/phospho-CrkL were determined by Western blot. RESULTS: Following a single oral administration of dasatinib at a preclinical efficacious dose of 1.25 or 2.5 mg/kg, tumoral phospho-BCR-ABL/phospho-CrkL were maximally inhibited at approximately 3 hours and recovered to basal levels by 24 hours. The time course and extent of the inhibition correlated with the plasma levels of dasatinib in mice. Pharmacokinetic/biomarker modeling predicted that the plasma concentration of dasatinib required to inhibit 90% of phospho-BCR-ABL in vivo was 10.9 ng/mL in mice and 14.6 ng/mL in humans, which is within the range of concentrations achieved in CML patients who responded to dasatinib treatment in the clinic. CONCLUSIONS: Phospho-BCR-ABL/phospho-CrkL are likely to be useful clinical biomarkers for the assessment of BCR-ABL kinase inhibition by dasatinib.","['Luo, Feng R', 'Yang, Zheng', 'Camuso, Amy', 'Smykla, Richard', 'McGlinchey, Kelly', 'Fager, Krista', 'Flefleh, Christine', 'Castaneda, Stephen', 'Inigo, Ivan', 'Kan, David', 'Wen, Mei-Li', 'Kramer, Robert', 'Blackwood-Chirchir, Anne', 'Lee, Francis Y']","['Luo FR', 'Yang Z', 'Camuso A', 'Smykla R', 'McGlinchey K', 'Fager K', 'Flefleh C', 'Castaneda S', 'Inigo I', 'Kan D', 'Wen ML', 'Kramer R', 'Blackwood-Chirchir A', 'Lee FY']","['Pharmaceutical Research Institute, Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, Princeton, New Jersey 08543, USA. roger.luo@bms.com']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (CRKL protein)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Thiazoles)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'RBZ1571X5H (Dasatinib)']",IM,"['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing/analysis/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Administration, Oral', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage/blood/*pharmacokinetics', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/analysis/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Dasatinib', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Female', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/analysis/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Humans', 'Injections, Intravenous', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy', 'Mice', 'Mice, SCID', 'Nuclear Proteins/analysis/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'Pyrimidines/administration & dosage/blood/*pharmacokinetics', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Thiazoles/administration & dosage/blood/*pharmacokinetics', 'Time Factors', 'Transplantation, Heterologous', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",,2006/12/06 09:00,2007/12/06 09:00,['2006/12/06 09:00'],"['2006/12/06 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/12/06 09:00 [medline]', '2006/12/06 09:00 [entrez]']","['12/23/7180 [pii]', '10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-06-1112 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2006 Dec 1;12(23):7180-6. doi: 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-06-1112.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The humanized monoclonal antibody alemtuzumab (CAMPATH-1H) is specific for CD52 and is Food and Drug Administration - approved for the treatment of relapsed or refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). The utility of CAMPATH in the treatment of other hematologic neoplasms has been explored; however, a comprehensive survey of CD52 expression among a broad spectrum of WHO-defined tumor types has not been completed. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We evaluated 294 hematologic neoplasms for the presence of CD52 using standard immunohistochemical techniques on paraffin-embedded biopsy specimens fixed with formalin, B-Plus, Zenker's acetic acid, or B5-formalin. RESULTS: The vast majority of low-grade B cell lymphoproliferative disorders (CLL/small lymphocytic leukemia, follicular lymphoma, lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma, hairy cell leukemia, and mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphomas) express CD52. In addition, we found that the majority of precursor B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphomas express this antigen. In contrast, there is surprising heterogeneity in CD52 expression among more aggressive B cell lymphomas, with 25% of cases of diffuse large B cell lymphoma and Burkitt lymphoma demonstrating no detectable CD52. In addition, the majority of neoplasms of the T cell lineage are negative for the antigen, including most cases of precursor T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma, anaplastic large cell lymphoma, and peripheral T cell lymphoma, not otherwise specified. Finally, the vast majority of cases of acute myeloid leukemia, Hodgkin lymphoma, and multiple myeloma are negative for CD52 expression. CONCLUSION: In contrast with CLL, the variable expression of CD52 among other hematologic malignancies suggests that target validation on a case-by-case basis will likely be necessary to guide the rational analysis of CAMPATH therapy.","['Rodig, Scott J', 'Abramson, Jeremy S', 'Pinkus, Geraldine S', 'Treon, Steven P', 'Dorfman, David M', 'Dong, Henry Y', 'Shipp, Margaret A', 'Kutok, Jeffery L']","['Rodig SJ', 'Abramson JS', 'Pinkus GS', 'Treon SP', 'Dorfman DM', 'Dong HY', 'Shipp MA', 'Kutok JL']","[""Department of Pathology, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts 02115, USA.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized)', '0 (Antibodies, Neoplasm)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (CD52 Antigen)', '0 (CD52 protein, human)', '0 (Glycoproteins)', '3A189DH42V (Alemtuzumab)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Alemtuzumab', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/*therapeutic use', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized', 'Antibodies, Neoplasm/*therapeutic use', 'Antigens, CD/*biosynthesis/drug effects', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/*biosynthesis/drug effects', 'CD52 Antigen', 'Glycoproteins/*biosynthesis/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', '*Leukemia, Myeloid/drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', '*Lymphoma, B-Cell/drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', '*Lymphoma, T-Cell/drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', '*Lymphoproliferative Disorders/drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Treatment Outcome']",,2006/12/06 09:00,2007/12/06 09:00,['2006/12/06 09:00'],"['2006/12/06 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/12/06 09:00 [medline]', '2006/12/06 09:00 [entrez]']","['12/23/7174 [pii]', '10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-06-1275 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2006 Dec 1;12(23):7174-9. doi: 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-06-1275.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

New molecular markers could help to refine cytogenetic stratification. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We assessed P-glycoprotein (Pgp) activity and Flt3 internal tandem duplication (ITD+) because of their known prognostic value and because they might lead to targeted therapy. We did a multivariate analysis on 171 patients with adult AML treated in the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer protocols. RESULTS: ITD+ and high Pgp activity (Pgp+) were found in 26 of 171 (15%) and 55 of 171 (32%) of all patients, respectively. ITD and Pgp activities were negative in 94 of 171 (55%, Pgp-ITD- group), mutually exclusive in 73 of 171 (43%, Pgp-ITD+ and Pgp+ITD- groups), and only 4 of 171 (2%, Pgp+ITD+ group) patients were positive for both. In multivariate analyses, Pgp+ITD+ (P < 0.0001) and age (P = 0.0022) were independent prognostic factors for the achievement of complete remission (CR). Overall survival (OS), CR achievement (P < 0.0001), WHO performance status (P = 0.0007), and Pgp+ITD+ status (P = 0.0014) were also independent prognostic factors. In 95 patients with intermediate cytogenetics, the CR rates of ITD+ patients were 40% versus 62% for ITD- (P = 0.099) and 41% versus 67% (P = 0.014) for Pgp+ versus Pgp- patients. In the Pgp-ITD- group (41 of 95), CR rates were 70% versus 44% for others (P = 0.012), OS achieved 48% versus 16% (P < 0.0001) and disease-free survival was 56% versus 27% (P = 0.024), respectively. Furthermore, the OS curves of the intermediate cytogenetics-Pgp-ITD- group were not significantly different from the favorable cytogenetic group. CONCLUSION: Flt3/ITD and Pgp activity are independent and additive prognostic factors which provide a powerful risk classification that can be routinely used to stratify the treatment of patients with intermediate cytogenetic AML. ITD+ and Pgp+ patients should be considered for targeted therapy.","['Marzac, Christophe', 'Teyssandier, I', ""Calendini, Ors'Anton"", 'Perrot, Jean-Yves', 'Faussat, Anne-Marie', 'Tang, Ruoping', 'Casadevall, Nicole', 'Marie, Jean-Pierre', 'Legrand, Ollivier']","['Marzac C', 'Teyssandier I', 'Calendini O', 'Perrot JY', 'Faussat AM', 'Tang R', 'Casadevall N', 'Marie JP', 'Legrand O']","['Universite Pierre et Marie Curie-Paris 6, UMRS 736, Les Cordeliers, INSERM, Paris F-75006, France.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B/*metabolism', 'Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Cytogenetic Analysis', 'Follow-Up Studies', '*Gene Duplication', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/diagnosis/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Middle Aged', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Prognosis', 'Remission Induction', 'Risk Factors', 'Survival Rate', 'Tandem Repeat Sequences', 'Treatment Outcome', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/*genetics']",,2006/12/06 09:00,2007/12/06 09:00,['2006/12/06 09:00'],"['2006/12/06 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/12/06 09:00 [medline]', '2006/12/06 09:00 [entrez]']","['12/23/7018 [pii]', '10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-06-0641 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2006 Dec 1;12(23):7018-24. doi: 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-06-0641.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

One hundred seventeen patients were entered in CCG-1962 study and randomized into the native and polyethylene glycolated asparaginase arms. VEGF-A levels were quantified by an ELISA assay. RESULTS: All patients had a decrease in VEGF-A levels by day 14 of induction, but they later dichotomized; EFS group levels remained low and event group levels increased. A correlation exists between high VEGF-A levels at entry to induction and time to event. Moreover, 6-year EFS patients have lower end of induction VEGF-A levels (28 +/- 6 pg/mL) than event patients (>100 pg/mL; P < 0.01). Kaplan-Meier curves using various VEGF-A values were produced; with < or =30 at entry into induction (day 0) and < or =60 pg/mL at the end of induction (day 28), patients with low VEGF-A levels had superior EFS (P < 1e-4). Furthermore, patients who had an increase in VEGF-A during induction (DeltaVEGF-positive, days 0-28) were more likely to have an event (P < 1e-4). Bifurcation by asparaginase treatment arm did not alter these results. CONCLUSIONS: These observations strongly support that high VEGF-A levels in induction are an asparaginase treatment-independent predictive marker for EFS. Hence, an anti-VEGF-A therapy should be tested in acute lymphoblastic leukemia.","['Avramis, Ioannis A', 'Panosyan, Eduard H', 'Dorey, Fred', 'Holcenberg, John S', 'Avramis, Vassilios I']","['Avramis IA', 'Panosyan EH', 'Dorey F', 'Holcenberg JS', 'Avramis VI']","[""Children's Hospital Los Angeles, California 90027, USA.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,['0 (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A)'],IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*blood/diagnosis/*drug therapy', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'Prognosis', 'Recurrence', 'Remission Induction', 'Risk Factors', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A/*blood']",,2006/12/06 09:00,2007/12/06 09:00,['2006/12/06 09:00'],"['2006/12/06 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/12/06 09:00 [medline]', '2006/12/06 09:00 [entrez]']","['12/23/6978 [pii]', '10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-06-1140 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2006 Dec 1;12(23):6978-84. doi: 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-06-1140.,,,,,,,,,"[""Children's Oncology Group""]",,,,,,,,,,

Here we report that cells deficient in Bax and Bak or caspase-9 do not undergo anoxia-induced cell death. However, the caspase-9 null cells do not survive reoxygenation due to the generation of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species. The individual loss of Bim, Bid, Puma, Noxa, Bad, caspase-2, or hypoxia-inducible factor 1beta, which are potential upstream regulators of Bax or Bak, did not prevent anoxia-induced cell death. Anoxia triggered the loss of the Mcl-1 protein upstream of Bax/Bak activation. Cells containing a mitochondrial DNA cytochrome b 4-base-pair deletion ([rho(-)] cells) and cells depleted of their entire mitochondrial DNA ([rho(0)] cells) are oxidative phosphorylation incompetent and displayed loss of the Mcl-1 protein under anoxia. [rho(0)] cells, in contrast to [rho(-)] cells, did not die under anoxia. However, [rho(0)] cells did undergo cell death in the presence of the Bad BH3 peptide, an inhibitor of Bcl-X(L)/Bcl-2 proteins. These results indicate that [rho(0)] cells survive under anoxia despite the loss of Mcl-1 protein due to residual prosurvival activity of the Bcl-X(L)/Bcl-2 proteins. Collectively, these results demonstrate that anoxia-induced cell death requires the loss of Mcl-1 protein and inhibition of the electron transport chain to negate Bcl-X(L)/Bcl-2 proteins.","['Brunelle, Joslyn K', 'Shroff, Emelyn H', 'Perlman, Harris', 'Strasser, Andreas', 'Moraes, Carlos T', 'Flavell, Richard A', 'Danial, Nika N', 'Keith, Brian', 'Thompson, Craig B', 'Chandel, Navdeep S']","['Brunelle JK', 'Shroff EH', 'Perlman H', 'Strasser A', 'Moraes CT', 'Flavell RA', 'Danial NN', 'Keith B', 'Thompson CB', 'Chandel NS']","['Department of Medicine, Northwestern University Medical School, 240 East Huron Avenue, Chicago, IL 60611, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20061204,United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,"['0 (DNA, Mitochondrial)', '0 (Hypoxia-Inducible Factor 1)', '0 (Mcl1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '9035-37-4 (Cytochromes b)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 9)', 'S88TT14065 (Oxygen)']",IM,"['Adaptation, Physiological/drug effects', 'Animals', 'Caspase 9/deficiency/metabolism', 'Cell Death/drug effects', 'Cell Hypoxia/drug effects', 'Cytochromes b/genetics', 'DNA, Mitochondrial/metabolism', 'Electron Transport/drug effects', 'Fibroblasts/*cytology/drug effects/enzymology', 'Glycolysis/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Hypoxia-Inducible Factor 1/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Models, Biological', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*deficiency/metabolism', 'Oxygen/pharmacology', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary/drug effects', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*deficiency/metabolism', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism', 'Sequence Deletion', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,2006/12/06 09:00,2007/03/17 09:00,['2006/12/06 09:00'],"['2006/12/06 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/03/17 09:00 [medline]', '2006/12/06 09:00 [entrez]']","['MCB.01535-06 [pii]', '10.1128/MCB.01535-06 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 2007 Feb;27(4):1222-35. doi: 10.1128/MCB.01535-06.

HTLV-1 encodes a trans-activating protein, Tax, which is largely responsible for the oncogenic properties of the virus. Tax promotes T cell transformation by deregulating the activity of various cellular factors, including the transcription factor NF-kappaB. Tax activates the IkappaB kinase (IKK) via physical interaction with the regulatory subunit, IKKgamma, although it is unknown precisely how Tax activates the IKK complex. Here we show that Tax modulates the cellular localization of the IKK complex. The IKKs relocalize from a broad distribution in the cytoplasm to concentrated perinuclear ""hot spots"" in both HTLV-1-transformed lines and in Tax-expressing Jurkat cells. Relocalization of IKK is not observed with Tax mutants unable to activate NF-kappaB, suggesting that only activated forms of IKK are relocalized. However, relocalization of IKK is strictly dependent on Tax expression because it does not occur in ATL cell lines that lack Tax expression or in Jurkat cells treated with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate and ionomycin. Furthermore, IKKgamma is required for redistribution because cells lacking IKKgamma were unable to relocalize IKKalpha upon expression of Tax. We also find that Tax ubiquitination likely regulates IKK relocalization because mutation of three critical lysine residues in Tax renders it unable to relocalize IKK and activate the canonical and noncanonical NF-kappaB pathways. Finally, we have observed that the perinuclear IKK in Tax-expressing cells colocalizes with the Golgi, and disruption of Golgi with either nocodazole or brefeldin A leads to a redistribution of IKK to the cytoplasm. Together, these results demonstrate that Tax induces relocalization of the IKK complex in a ubiquitin-dependent manner, and dynamic changes in the subcellular localization of the IKK complex may be critical for Tax function.","['Harhaj, Nicole S', 'Sun, Shao-Cong', 'Harhaj, Edward W']","['Harhaj NS', 'Sun SC', 'Harhaj EW']","['Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center, The University of Miami, Miller School of Medicine, Miami, Florida 33136, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20061204,United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Ubiquitin)', 'EC 2.7.11.10 (I-kappa B Kinase)', 'K3Z4F929H6 (Lysine)']",IM,"['Cell Line, Transformed', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Nucleus/enzymology', 'Enzyme Activation/physiology', 'Gene Products, tax/genetics/*physiology', 'Golgi Apparatus/enzymology', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*enzymology/genetics', 'Humans', 'I-kappa B Kinase/*metabolism', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Lysine/genetics', 'Mutagenesis, Site-Directed', 'NF-kappa B/*metabolism', 'Ubiquitin/*physiology']",,2006/12/06 09:00,2007/03/24 09:00,['2006/12/06 09:00'],"['2006/12/06 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/03/24 09:00 [medline]', '2006/12/06 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0021-9258(19)33751-2 [pii]', '10.1074/jbc.M611031200 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2007 Feb 9;282(6):4185-92. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M611031200.

RESULTS: It is recommended that therapy is commenced in patients with CLL when at least one of the following are present: B-symptoms, progressive/obstructive lymphadenopathy or organomegaly, rapid lymphocyte doubling time, anemia or thrombocytopenia (of new onset, worsening or steroid-resistant). It is recommended that patients without co-morbidity should receive fludarabine plus cyclophosphamide, whereas elderly patients with co-morbidity should receive oral chlorambucil. Younger patients with unfavorable biological risk factors should be considered for high-dose chemotherapy and autologous or allogeneic stem cell transplantation within approved clinical trials. Patients either relapsing rapidly after, or non-responsive to, first-line chlorambucil should receive fludarabine-containing regimens. Patients either relapsing soon after or not responding to fludarabine-based chemotherapy should be considered for schedules including non-cross-reactive agents, such as alemtuzumab, possibly followed by high-dose chemotherapy and autologous transplantation in the context of a clinical trial or by allogeneic stem cell transplantation. CONCLUSIONS: We describe the results of a systematic literature review and an explicit approach to consensus techniques which resulted in recommendations for the key therapeutic decisions in patients with CLL.","['Brugiatelli, Maura', 'Bandini, Giuseppe', 'Barosi, Giovanni', 'Lauria, Francesco', 'Liso, Vincenzo', 'Marchetti, Monia', 'Mauro, Francesca Romana', 'Meloni, Giovanna', 'Zinzani, Pier Luigi', 'Tura, Sante']","['Brugiatelli M', 'Bandini G', 'Barosi G', 'Lauria F', 'Liso V', 'Marchetti M', 'Mauro FR', 'Meloni G', 'Zinzani PL', 'Tura S']","['Divisione di Ematologia, Azienda Ospedaliera Papardo, Messina, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Practice Guideline', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,,IM,"['Bone Marrow Transplantation/*standards', 'Disease Management', 'Hematology/*standards', 'Humans', 'Italy', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/diagnosis/*therapy', 'Societies, Medical/*standards']",,2006/12/06 09:00,2007/01/26 09:00,['2006/12/06 09:00'],"['2006/12/06 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/01/26 09:00 [medline]', '2006/12/06 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Haematologica. 2006 Dec;91(12):1662-73.,,,,,,,,,"['Italian Society of Hematology', 'Italian Society of Experimental Hematology', 'Italian Group for Bone Marrow Transplantation']",,,,,,,,,,

Initially, T-cell based cancer vaccines were designed for patients with solid tumors after the definition of suitable tumor-associated antigens. Several immunological and even clinical responses prompted researchers and clinicians to extend the spectrum of cancer vaccines towards hematologic malignancies such as acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Only 20-40% of all patients with AML achieve a disease-free survival of more than 5 years. The graft-versus-leukemia (GVL) effect observed after allogeneic stem cell transplantation and donor lymphocyte infusions strongly suggests that T lymphocytes play a major role in the rejection of leukemic cells. Therefore, immunotherapy directed against leukemia-associated antigens might elicit specific immune responses that could eliminate minimal residual disease after chemotherapy, or enhance the GVL effect after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. This review summarizes hitherto identified and characterized LAA as targets for T-cell-based immunotherapies. Current clinical peptide vaccination trials targeting different epitopes of the Wilms' tumor gene 1 (WT1), the proteinase-3 derived epitope peptide (PR1) and the receptor for hyaluronic acid mediated motility (RHAMM/CD168)-derived epitope R3 are reviewed, and perspectives but also limitations of immunotherapeutic approaches for AML patients are discussed.","['Greiner, Jochen', 'Dohner, Hartmut', 'Schmitt, Michael']","['Greiner J', 'Dohner H', 'Schmitt M']","['Tumor Immunology Group, Dept. of Internal Medicine III, Robert-Koch-Str. 8 University of Ulm, 89081 Ulm, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,"['0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Cancer Vaccines)']",IM,"['Antigens, Neoplasm/*immunology', 'Cancer Vaccines/*immunology/*therapeutic use', '*Clinical Protocols', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*immunology/prevention & control/*therapy']",113,2006/12/06 09:00,2007/01/26 09:00,['2006/12/06 09:00'],"['2006/12/06 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/01/26 09:00 [medline]', '2006/12/06 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Haematologica. 2006 Dec;91(12):1653-61.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

DESIGN AND METHODS: We classified 1095 patients with MDS diagnosed at our institution between November 1999 and December 2004 according to French-American-British (FAB) and WHO criteria by central morphologic review. The study was not population-based, but included all newly diagnosed patients from different regions in Germany. Patients were followed for survival and disease evolution to acute myeloid leukemia (AML) through December 31th, 2005. RESULTS: According to the WHO classification, there were 89 cases of refractory anemia (RA), 293 of refractory cytopenias with multilineage dysplasia (RCMD), 31 RA with ringed sideroblasts (RARS), 139 RCMD with ringed sideroblasts (RCMD-RS), 142 RA with excess blasts (RAEB) I and 149 RAEB II and 52 patients with 5q- syndrome. The median survival of patients with RA or RARS was not reached, the median survival of patients with RCMD was 31 months, that of patients with RCMD-RS was 28 months, that of 5q- patients was 40 months, of RAEB I 27 months and of RAEB II 12 months. The cumulative risk of AML evolution 2 years after diagnosis was 0% in RA and RARS, 8% in 5q-, 9% in RCMD, 12% in RCMD-RS, 13% in RAEB I and 40% in RAEB II. The number of high-risk karyotypes was lower in patients with RA/RARS than in those with RCMD/RCMD-RS and RAEB I/RAEB II. Karyotype findings were major prognostic variables. INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: The WHO classification is feasible and provides valuable prognostic information, even in a short-term prospective study. Together with cytogenetic data and other prognostic parameters, the WHO classification is very useful for clinical decision making.","['Germing, Ulrich', 'Strupp, Corinna', 'Kuendgen, Andrea', 'Isa, Shadi', 'Knipp, Sabine', 'Hildebrandt, Barbara', 'Giagounidis, Aristoteles', 'Aul, Carlo', 'Gattermann, Norbert', 'Haas, Rainer']","['Germing U', 'Strupp C', 'Kuendgen A', 'Isa S', 'Knipp S', 'Hildebrandt B', 'Giagounidis A', 'Aul C', 'Gattermann N', 'Haas R']","['Department of Hematology, Oncology and Clinical Immunology Heinrich-Heine-University Moorenstr. 5, 40225 Dusseldorf, Germany. germing@med.uni-duesseldorf.de']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Validation Study']",,Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*classification/mortality', 'Prospective Studies', 'Survival Rate', '*World Health Organization']",,2006/12/06 09:00,2007/01/26 09:00,['2006/12/06 09:00'],"['2006/12/06 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/01/26 09:00 [medline]', '2006/12/06 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Haematologica. 2006 Dec;91(12):1596-604.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In general, 3 breakpoint cluster regions in the BCR gene have been described: major (M-bcr), minor (m-bcr), and micro (mu-bcr). This study was designed to determine the frequency of BCR-ABL transcripts using one-step multiplex reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Bone marrow (BM) or peripheral blood (PB) samples at diagnosis from 548 patients were obtained with a referring diagnosis of Ph-positive (Ph+) CML, and multistep RT-PCR and newly developed one-step multiplex RT-PCR were applied on each sample. Compared with the previous multistep RT-PCR, one-step multiplex RT-PCR with the primers is the more rapid and accurate method to identify the BCR-ABL breakpoints. Most patients (538/548, 98.18%) were found to have b3a2 or b2a2, and total frequency of occurrence of c3a2, e1a2, b2a3, b1a1, and e1a3 or coexpression of b2a2 and b3a2 was less than 2.00%. No differences were observed between women and men. As the multiplex RT-PCR technique distinguishes BCR-ABL transcripts in all samples with high sensitivity and specificity, it easily could be applied at early stages of diagnosis. The incidence of one or the other rearrangement in CML patients varies in different reported series, and the frequency in each type of BCR-ABL transcript in Korean CML patients seems to be different from those of Western countries.","['Goh, Hyun-Gyung', 'Hwang, Ji-Yeon', 'Kim, Soo-Hyun', 'Lee, Young-Hoon', 'Kim, Yoo-Li', 'Kim, Dong-Wook']","['Goh HG', 'Hwang JY', 'Kim SH', 'Lee YH', 'Kim YL', 'Kim DW']","[""Division of Hematology, St. Mary's Hospital, The Catholic University of Korea, Youngdeungpo-gu, Seoul, Korea.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Transl Res,Translational research : the journal of laboratory and clinical medicine,101280339,"['0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'DNA, Complementary/genetics', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Korea', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*genetics', 'RNA, Neoplasm/genetics/isolation & purification', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction/*methods', '*Transcription, Genetic']",,2006/12/06 09:00,2007/01/30 09:00,['2006/12/06 09:00'],"['2006/02/17 00:00 [received]', '2006/07/15 00:00 [revised]', '2006/07/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2006/12/06 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/01/30 09:00 [medline]', '2006/12/06 09:00 [entrez]']","['S1931-5244(06)00299-4 [pii]', '10.1016/j.trsl.2006.07.002 [doi]']",ppublish,Transl Res. 2006 Nov;148(5):249-56. doi: 10.1016/j.trsl.2006.07.002.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A single point mutation of JAK2 (Val617Phe) has been detected in PV, ET and myelofibrosis (MF). The aim of this work was to investigate the JAK2 mutation in patients with MPD and to compare the results to those of the endogenous formation of BFU-E erythroid colonies (EEC). Finally, different sources of hematopoietic cells to obtain DNA were evaluated. PATIENTS AND METHOD: In this work 146 patents were studied (81 MPD: 27 PV, 28 ET, 11 MF and 15 with myeloid chronic leukemia). Moreover, 28 patients showed secondary polycythemias or reactive thrombocytosis, 8 MPD/myelodysplastic syndromes and 29 other disorders. In 54 patients, EEC were also evaluated. Peripheral blood cells were used as source of DNA in 122 patients, bone marrow in 33, cells from BFU-E in 14 and cells from EEC in 24 patients. Their DNA samples were analyzed using an allele-specific polimerase chain reaction methodology. RESULTS: The JAK2 mutation was present in 96% of PV patients, 59% of ET and 63.6% of MF. None of the remaining patients showed this mutation. Diagnostic agreement was excellent between EEC and the mutation (kappa index = 0.93; 97% positive agreement and 95% negative agreement). DNA was obtained in 119 out of 122 samples from peripheral blood, in all patients with bone marrow, and in 50% of patients with BFU-E or EEC. In 7 cases, samples from different cell sources were studied. Their results were identical. CONCLUSIONS: The V617F mutation of JAK2 is present in most of PV patients and half of those with MF or ET.

Dideoxypetrosynol A decreased the levels of cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 mRNA and protein expression without significant changes in the levels of COX-1, which was correlated with a decrease in prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) synthesis. Furthermore, dideoxypetrosynol A treatment markedly inhibited the activity of telomerase, and the expression of human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT), a main determinant of the telomerase enzymatic activity, was progressively down-regulated by dideoxypetrosynol A treatment in a dose-dependent fashion. Taken together, these findings provide important new insights into the possible molecular mechanisms of the anti-cancer activity of dideoxypetrosynol A.","['Park, Cheol', 'Jung, Jee H', 'Kim, Nam Deuk', 'Choi, Yung Hyun']","['Park C', 'Jung JH', 'Kim ND', 'Choi YH']","['Department of Biochemistry, Dongeui University College of Oriental Medicine, Busan 614-052, Korea.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Greece,Int J Oncol,International journal of oncology,9306042,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Cyclooxygenase Inhibitors)', '0 (Fatty Alcohols)', '0 (Tissue Extracts)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', '0 (dideoxypetrosynol A)', '25067-58-7 (Polyynes)', 'EC 1.14.99.1 (Cyclooxygenase 2)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (Telomerase)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cyclooxygenase 2/*metabolism', 'Cyclooxygenase Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Fatty Alcohols/*pharmacology', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia', '*Petrosia', 'Polyynes/*pharmacology', 'Telomerase/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Tissue Extracts/*pharmacology', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein/drug effects/genetics']",,2006/12/05 09:00,2007/02/01 09:00,['2006/12/05 09:00'],"['2006/12/05 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/02/01 09:00 [medline]', '2006/12/05 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Int J Oncol. 2007 Jan;30(1):291-8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The enzyme inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase is a potentially useful target for drug development, since its activity has been shown to be amplified in malignant cells. Thiophenfurin, an inhibitor of the enzyme synthesized by us, is endowed with a significant apoptotic activity in promyelocytic leukaemia HL60 cells. Since retinoids were successfully employed in the treatment of patients with leukaemia, demonstrating significant differentiation-inducing and apoptotic effects, we carried out this study to evaluate the effects of the combination of thiophenfurin and several retinoid molecules, acting in different phases of the cell cycle in vitro. The results show that thiophenfurin is capable of eliciting significant S phase-specific antiproliferative effects in different sensitive and resistant cell lines with the IC50s ranging from 6.7 to 26 microM. When HL60 cells were treated with thiophenfurin in combination with retinoids, the effects on cell growth were additive or synergistic, depending on the kind of retinoid used and the sequence of treatment. In particular, we observed additive effects when the cells were exposed to thiophenfurin and all-transretinoic acid either simultaneously or sequentially. Instead, when the new heterocyclic retinoid isoxazole benzoic acid was used, synergism was obtained in the cells treated sequentially. The combination of thiophenfurin and isoxazole benzoic acid determined synergistic apoptotic effects through a mitochondrion-dependent mechanism, suggesting the possible usefulness of this combination in the treatment of leukaemia.","['Meli, Maria', 'Tolomeo, Manlio', 'Grifantini, Mario', 'Franchetti, Palmarisa', 'Cappellacci, Loredana', 'Simoni, Daniele', 'Invidiata, Francesco P', 'Aiello, Stefania', 'Dusonchet, Luisa']","['Meli M', 'Tolomeo M', 'Grifantini M', 'Franchetti P', 'Cappellacci L', 'Simoni D', 'Invidiata FP', 'Aiello S', 'Dusonchet L']","['Dipartimento di Scienze Farmacologiche, Universita di Palermo, via del Vespro 129, I-90127 Palermo, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Greece,Oncol Rep,Oncology reports,9422756,"['0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Ribonucleosides)', '43C65ZS2XK (thiophenfurin)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'EC 1.1.1.205 (IMP Dehydrogenase)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Growth Processes/drug effects', 'Drug Synergism', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/administration & dosage/pharmacology', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'IMP Dehydrogenase/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Membrane Potential, Mitochondrial/drug effects/physiology', 'Mitochondria/drug effects/physiology', 'Ribonucleosides/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Tretinoin/administration & dosage/*pharmacology']",,2006/12/05 09:00,2007/01/17 09:00,['2006/12/05 09:00'],"['2006/12/05 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/01/17 09:00 [medline]', '2006/12/05 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Oncol Rep. 2007 Jan;17(1):185-92.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Specific blockers of angiogenesis are now being introduced into early clinical trials with encouraging results. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) seems to play a central role in tumor angiogenesis and is associated with a poor prognosis in both solid tumors and adult leukemias. In pediatric acute lymphocytic leukemia however, the expression of angiogenic molecules and its relation to prognosis and relapse are unknown. Therefore, we prospectively analyzed 46 pediatric patients with precursor B cell acute lymphocytic leukemia by semi-quantitative RT-PCR for expression of the angiogenic molecules VEGF, VEGF-C, iNOS and TGF-beta and correlated relapse and survival data with the expression of these factors. We found a high mRNA expression of TGF-beta and iNOS, a moderate expression of VEGF but no expression of bFGF and VEGF-C. A significantly higher expression of VEGF mRNA was found in patients with late relapses compared to patients without relapses (p=0.043). A significantly higher mRNA expression of iNOS was found in surviving patients compared with non-surviving patients (p=0.023). Angiogenic factors are expressed in the bone marrow of patients with pediatric B cell precursor ALL and VEGF is a potential candidate for therapeutic intervention as it is significantly higher expressed in children with late relapses. The mRNA expression of iNOS in the surviving children possibly reflects an increased activity of the immune system against the leukemia which leads to a superior survival.","['Stachel, Daniel', 'Albert, Michael', 'Meilbeck, Rita', 'Paulides, Marios', 'Schmid, Irene']","['Stachel D', 'Albert M', 'Meilbeck R', 'Paulides M', 'Schmid I']","['Klinik mit Poliklinik fur Kinder und Jugendliche, Friedrich-Alexander Universitat Erlangen-Nurnberg, D-91054 Erlangen, Germany. daniel.stachel@kinder.imed.uni-erlangen.de']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Greece,Oncol Rep,Oncology reports,9422756,"['0 (Angiogenic Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Transforming Growth Factor beta)', '0 (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A)', '0 (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor C)', '103107-01-3 (Fibroblast Growth Factor 2)', 'EC 1.14.13.39 (Nitric Oxide Synthase Type II)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Angiogenic Proteins/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Bone Marrow Cells/metabolism', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/genetics/*metabolism', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Fibroblast Growth Factor 2/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Neovascularization, Pathologic/genetics/metabolism', 'Nitric Oxide Synthase Type II/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics/*metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Transforming Growth Factor beta/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor C/biosynthesis/genetics']",,2006/12/05 09:00,2007/01/17 09:00,['2006/12/05 09:00'],"['2006/12/05 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/01/17 09:00 [medline]', '2006/12/05 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Oncol Rep. 2007 Jan;17(1):147-52.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We also show that, in analogy with some leukaemia cells, GL15 cells display the constitutively phosphorylated form of Janus kinase 2 (JAK2), a tyrosine kinase expressed during CNS development but undetectable in the normal adult brain. The constitutive activation of JAK2 does not result from chromosomal aberrations involving the JAK2 gene, but most probably from abnormally activated transduction systems operative in glioblastoma cells. We then investigated the effects of tyrphostin AG490, an inhibitor of JAK2 autophosphorylation, on GL15 cell growth. In the absence of exogenous growth factors and cytokines, 10 microM tyrphostin AG490 induces an S phase arrest, combined with a partial impairment of the G2 phase of the cell cycle.

In the present study, the ability of these compounds to inhibit monoacylglycerol lipase and fatty acid amide hydrolase has been reinvestigated. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: Homogenates and cell lines were incubated with test compounds and, thereafter, with either [(3)H]-2-oleoylglycerol or [(3)H]-anandamide. Labelled reaction products were separated from substrate using chloroform: methanol extraction. KEY RESULTS: In cytosolic fractions from rat brain, URB602 and URB754 inhibited the hydrolysis of 2-oleoylglycerol with IC(50) values of 25 and 48 microM, respectively. Anandamide hydrolysis by brain membranes was not sensitive to URB754, but was inhibited by URB602 (IC(50) value 17 microM). Hydrolysis of 2-oleoylglycerol by human recombinant monoacylglycerol lipase was sensitive to URB602, but not URB754. The lack of selectivity of URB602 for 2-oleoylglycerol compared to anandamide hydrolysis was also observed for intact RBL2H3 basophilic leukaemia cells. C6 glioma expressed mRNA for monoacylglycerol lipase, and hydrolyzed 2-oleoylglycerol in a manner sensitive to inhibition by methyl arachidonoyl fluorophosphonate but not URB754 or URB597. MC3T3-E1 mouse osteoblastic cells, which did not express mRNA for monoacylglycerol lipase, hydrolyzed 2-oleoylglycerol in the presence of URB597, but the hydrolysis was less sensitive to methyl arachidonoyl fluorophosphonate than for C6 cells. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: The data demonstrate that the compounds URB602 and URB754 do not behave as selective and/or potent inhibitors of monoacylglycerol lipase.","['Vandevoorde, S', 'Jonsson, K-O', 'Labar, G', 'Persson, E', 'Lambert, D M', 'Fowler, C J']","['Vandevoorde S', 'Jonsson KO', 'Labar G', 'Persson E', 'Lambert DM', 'Fowler CJ']","['Department of Pharmacology and Clinical Neuroscience, Umea University, Umea, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20061204,England,Br J Pharmacol,British journal of pharmacology,7502536,"['0 (Aniline Compounds)', '0 (Arachidonic Acids)', '0 (Benzoxazines)', '0 (Biphenyl Compounds)', '0 (Endocannabinoids)', '0 (Glycerides)', '0 (Polyunsaturated Alkamides)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (URB 754)', '0 (URB602)', '9A2389K694 (2-oleoylglycerol)', 'EC 3.1.1.23 (Monoacylglycerol Lipases)', 'EC 3.5.- (Amidohydrolases)', 'EC 3.5.1.- (fatty-acid amide hydrolase)', 'UR5G69TJKH (anandamide)']",IM,"['Amidohydrolases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Aniline Compounds/*pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Arachidonic Acids/*metabolism', 'Benzoxazines/*pharmacology', 'Biphenyl Compounds/*pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cerebellum/metabolism', 'Cytosol/metabolism', 'Endocannabinoids', 'Glycerides/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Hydrolysis', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Male', 'Membranes/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Monoacylglycerol Lipases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Polyunsaturated Alkamides/*metabolism', 'Rats', 'Rats, Wistar', 'Recombinant Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors']",,2006/12/05 09:00,2007/04/03 09:00,['2006/12/05 09:00'],"['2006/12/05 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/04/03 09:00 [medline]', '2006/12/05 09:00 [entrez]']","['0706971 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.bjp.0706971 [doi]']",ppublish,Br J Pharmacol. 2007 Jan;150(2):186-91. doi: 10.1038/sj.bjp.0706971.

Compared to that seen in other indications such as breast cancer, multiple myeloma or germ cell tumors, there is a substantially increased risk for t-AML/MDS following ASCT for lymphoma. This risk has largely been attributed to the extent of pre-transplant chemotherapy and radiation therapy. In many of the larger series to date, it has not been possible to directly implicate autologous transplantation itself as a risk factor for t-AML/MDS. Although pre-transplant therapy is certainly an important factor in the development of t-AML/MDS, specific components of the autologous transplantation procedure itself may also contribute to the risk of t-AML/MDS. Specifically, priming chemotherapy, total body irradiation, and the extensive cellular proliferation which occurs during engraftment may all play a role in the development of t-AML/MDS. Furthermore, there is an increasing body of evidence that certain inherited polymorphisms in genes governing drug metabolism, DNA repair and leukemogenesis may influence susceptibility to t-AML/MDS. In this paper, we review the evidence implicating the above risk factors for t-AML/MDS, present a potential mechanism for t-AML/MDS and propose interventions to reduce the rate of t-AML/MDS in lymphoma patients.","['Hake, C R', 'Graubert, T A', 'Fenske, T S']","['Hake CR', 'Graubert TA', 'Fenske TS']","['Division of Neoplastic Diseases and Related Disorders, Department of Medicine, Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, WI 53226, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20061204,England,Bone Marrow Transplant,Bone marrow transplantation,8702459,,IM,"['Bone Marrow Transplantation/*adverse effects', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/epidemiology/*etiology', 'Lymphoma/*surgery', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/epidemiology/etiology', 'Transplantation, Autologous/*adverse effects']",98,2006/12/05 09:00,2007/07/17 09:00,['2006/12/05 09:00'],"['2006/12/05 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/07/17 09:00 [medline]', '2006/12/05 09:00 [entrez]']","['1705547 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.bmt.1705547 [doi]']",ppublish,Bone Marrow Transplant. 2007 Jan;39(2):59-70. doi: 10.1038/sj.bmt.1705547.

Chlorambucil had been the cornerstone of treatment for decades. Now, treatment approaches typically include a purine nucleoside analog, such as fludarabine, in combination with immunotherapy, most commonly rituximab but also alemtuzumab. Several clinical trials of patients with untreated CLL have reported overall response rates as high as 95% with chemoimmunotherapy. Combinations include fludarabine, cyclophosphamide, and rituximab (FCR); pentostatin, cyclophosphamide, and rituximab; fludarabine and rituximab; and fludarabine and alemtuzumab. FCR has demonstrated complete response rates of 70% as frontline therapy. In addition, molecular prognostic indicators, such as IgVH mutational status, ZAP-70 expression, and chromosomal mutations (trisomy 12; 17p, and 11q deletions) are proving useful in identifying patients with poor-risk disease. Furthermore, advanced technologies such as polymerase chain reaction and flow cytometry can be used to detect minimal residual disease with increasing sensitivity. Elimination of minimal residual disease has been linked to improved survival and become an important clinical goal. While overall response rates with current chemotherapy treatments are superior to those seen with single agents (eg, chlorambucil), many CLL patients still fall short of achieving a complete response. Novel agents with unique, nonoverlapping mechanisms of action (eg, oblimersen sodium, lenalidomide, HuMax-CD20, GX15-070), and other treatments are under investigation in an attempt to further improve outcomes.","['Kay, Neil E', 'Rai, Kanti R', ""O'Brien, Susan""]","['Kay NE', 'Rai KR', ""O'Brien S""]","['Mayo Clinic College of Medicine, Rochester, Minn, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,Clin Adv Hematol Oncol,Clinical advances in hematology & oncology : H&O,101167661,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized)', '0 (Antibodies, Neoplasm)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Variable Region)', '18D0SL7309 (Chlorambucil)', '3A189DH42V (Alemtuzumab)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (ZAP-70 Protein-Tyrosine Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (ZAP70 protein, human)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'P2K93U8740 (fludarabine)']",IM,"['Alemtuzumab', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/therapeutic use', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized', 'Antibodies, Neoplasm/therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Chlorambucil/therapeutic use', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 12/genetics/metabolism', 'Cyclophosphamide/therapeutic use', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/drug effects/genetics', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/genetics/metabolism', 'Immunoglobulin Variable Region/genetics/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy/genetics/metabolism/mortality', 'Neoplasm, Residual', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Risk Factors', 'Survival Rate', 'Trisomy/genetics', 'Vidarabine/analogs & derivatives/therapeutic use', 'ZAP-70 Protein-Tyrosine Kinase/biosynthesis/genetics']",0,2006/12/05 09:00,2008/07/02 09:00,['2006/12/05 09:00'],"['2006/12/05 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/07/02 09:00 [medline]', '2006/12/05 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Clin Adv Hematol Oncol. 2006 Nov;4(11 Suppl 22):1-10; quiz 11-2.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This view is compatible with the concept of stem cell plasticity as a reversible continuum and is substantiated by the common hematopoietic-endothelial stem cell, i.e., hemangioblasts, with bidirectional, reversible gene transcription and persistence in postnatal life. Indeed, embryonal stem cells/hemangioblasts appear to form a reservior in the adult with the possibility of dedifferentiation of more differentiated progenitor cells back to hemangioblasts. The recent detection of BCR/ABL fusion proteins in endothelial cells during vascular neoangiogenesis in CML suggests that endothelial cells are part of the neoplastic clone, and extends the concept of a functional entity to include CML angiogenesis. Thus, hemangioblasts rather than committed hematopoietic stem cells appear to be target cells for the first oncogenic hit in CML, which could occur as early as during the first steps of embryonal stem cell differentiation towards hemato-endotheliopoiesis and/or in hemangioblasts persisting in adults.

The genetic lesions of leukemia result in a block of differentiation (maturation arrest) that allows myeloid leukemic cells to continue to proliferate and/or prevents the terminal differentiation and apoptosis seen in normal white blood cells. In chronic myeloid leukemia, the bcr-abl (t9/22) translocation produces a fusion product that is an activated tyrosine kinase resulting in constitutive activation cells at the myelocyte level. This activation may be inhibited by imatinib mesylate (Gleevec, STI-571), which blocks the binding of ATP to the activated tyrosine kinase, prevents phosphorylation, and allows the leukemic cells to differentiate and undergo apoptosis. In acute promyelocytic leukemia, fusion of the retinoic acid receptor-alpha with the gene coding for promyelocytic protein, the PML-RAR alpha (t15:17) translocation, produces a fusion product that blocks the activity of the promyelocytic protein, which is required for formation of the granules of promyelocytes and prevents further differentiation. Retinoic acids bind to the retinoic acid receptor (RAR alpha) component of the fusion product, resulting in degradation of the fusion protein by ubiquitinization. This allows normal PML to participate in granule formation and differentiation of the promyelocytes. In one common type of acute myeloid leukemia, which results in maturation arrest at the myeloid precursor level, there is a mutation of FLT3, a transmembrane tyrosine kinase, which results in constitutive activation of the IL-3 receptor. This may be blocked by agents that inhibit farnesyl transferase. In each of these examples, specific inhibition of the genetically altered activation molecules of the leukemic cells allows the leukemic cells to differentiate and die.

Recently described in vitro and in vivo model systems that support the proliferation and expansion of ALL cells have provided new tools to investigate the cellular targets for the origin of this malignancy. Evidence suggests that some subtypes of childhood ALL have a primitive cell origin and share many immunophenotypic characteristics with normal progenitor cells. These leukemic stem cells may be resistant to current therapeutic strategies designed to kill the bulk ALL cell population and subsequent relapses may arise from this population. More precise definition of these ALL stem cells through combined analyses of antigen expression, genetic lesions, and functionality is essential for the development of more effective, targeted therapeutic strategies.","['Cox, C V', 'Blair, A']","['Cox CV', 'Blair A']","['Bristol Institute for Transfusion Sciences, University of Bristol BS10 5ND, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,Stem Cell Rev,Stem cell reviews,101255952,"['0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/genetics/*immunology', 'B-Lymphocytes/immunology/pathology', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/genetics/*immunology', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/genetics/*immunology/pathology/therapy', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*immunology/pathology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics/*immunology/pathology/therapy', 'Recurrence']",54,2006/12/05 09:00,2007/01/24 09:00,['2006/12/05 09:00'],"['2006/12/05 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/01/24 09:00 [medline]', '2006/12/05 09:00 [entrez]']","['SCR:1:3:189 [pii]', '10.1385/SCR:1:3:189 [doi]']",ppublish,Stem Cell Rev. 2005;1(3):189-96. doi: 10.1385/SCR:1:3:189.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Yet, despite their critical importance, much remains to be learned about the developmental origin of LSCs and the mechanisms responsible for their emergence in the course of the disease. Mouse models of human leukemias have provided a unique system to study the mechanisms influencing LSC generation and function, and were recently used to demonstrate that LSCs can arise from both self-renewing hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and committed progenitor populations. This striking finding indicates that LSC identity is largely dictated by the nature of the oncogenic events and by how these events perturb essential processes such as self-renewal, proliferation, differentiation, and survival. Such approaches in the mouse are essential for the basic understanding of leukemogenesis and for the conceptual design of novel therapeutic strategies that could lead to improved treatments for human leukemias.","['Passegue, Emmanuelle', 'Weisman, Irving L']","['Passegue E', 'Weisman IL']","['Stanford University School of Medicine, Pathology Department, Beckman Center B259, Stanford, CA 94305, USA. passegue@stanford.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",,United States,Stem Cell Rev,Stem cell reviews,101255952,,IM,"['Animals', '*Cell Differentiation', '*Cell Proliferation', 'Cell Survival', 'Disease Models, Animal', '*Hematopoiesis', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*metabolism/pathology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*metabolism/pathology/therapy', 'Mice', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*metabolism/pathology']",65,2006/12/05 09:00,2007/01/24 09:00,['2006/12/05 09:00'],"['2006/12/05 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/01/24 09:00 [medline]', '2006/12/05 09:00 [entrez]']","['SCR:1:3:181 [pii]', '10.1385/SCR:1:3:181 [doi]']",ppublish,Stem Cell Rev. 2005;1(3):181-8. doi: 10.1385/SCR:1:3:181.,,,,,,,['CA86017/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, we analyze the murine Ab response as a model to study the B cell epitopes associated with PE38. Sixty distinct mAbs to PE38 were characterized. Mutual competitive binding of the mAbs indicated the presence of 7 major epitope groups and 13 subgroups. The competition pattern indicated that the epitopes are discrete and could not be reproduced using a computer simulation program that created epitopes out of random surface residues on PE38. Using sera from immunotoxin-treated patients, the formation of human Abs to each of the topographical epitopes was demonstrated. One epitope subgroup, E1a, was identified as the principal neutralizing epitope. The location of each epitope on PE38 was determined by preparing 41 mutants of PE38 in which bulky surface residues were mutated to either alanine or glycine. All 7 major epitope groups and 9 of 13 epitope subgroups were identified by 14 different mutants and these retained high cytotoxic activity.

OCTN1 in humans is expressed in synovial tissues of individuals with rheumatoid arthritis. Furthermore octn1 in mice is expressed in inflamed joints with collagen-induced arthritis, a model of human arthritis, but not in the joints of normal mice. OCTN1 should be involved in the inflammatory disease and in the present study, the regulatory mechanism of OCTN1 expression was characterized using the human fibroblast-like synoviocyte cell line MH7A, derived from RA patients. A luciferase-reporter gene assay and gel shift assay demonstrated that RUNX1, which is an essential hematopoietic transcription factor associated with acute myeloid leukemia and is related to RA and Sp1, is involved in the regulation of OCTN1 promoter activity. Inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-1beta and tumor necrosis factor-alpha increased the expression of OCTN1 mRNA. Furthermore, overexpression of nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) activated promoter activity of OCTN1. These results clearly demonstrate that expression of OCTN1 is regulated by various factors, including RUNX1, inflammatory cytokines, and NF-kappaB, all of which are also related to the pathogenesis of RA. Further studies on the physiological substrate(s) of OCTN1 should be done to clarify the roles of OCTN1 in these diseases.","['Maeda, Tomoji', 'Hirayama, Masamichi', 'Kobayashi, Daisuke', 'Miyazawa, Keiji', 'Tamai, Ikumi']","['Maeda T', 'Hirayama M', 'Kobayashi D', 'Miyazawa K', 'Tamai I']","['Department of Molecular Biopharmaceutics, Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Tokyo University of Science, 2641 Yamasaki, Noda, Chiba, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20061201,United States,Drug Metab Dispos,Drug metabolism and disposition: the biological fate of chemicals,9421550,"['0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (Interleukin-1beta)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Organic Cation Transport Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RUNX1 protein, human)', '0 (SLC22A4 protein, human)', '0 (Sp1 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Symporters)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)']",IM,"['Arthritis, Rheumatoid/*metabolism', 'Binding Sites', 'Cell Line', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit/genetics/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-1beta/pharmacology', 'Mutation', 'NF-kappa B/genetics/*metabolism', 'Organic Cation Transport Proteins/*genetics', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Sp1 Transcription Factor/genetics/*metabolism', 'Symporters', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/pharmacology']",,2006/12/05 09:00,2007/06/15 09:00,['2006/12/05 09:00'],"['2006/12/05 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/06/15 09:00 [medline]', '2006/12/05 09:00 [entrez]']","['dmd.106.012112 [pii]', '10.1124/dmd.106.012112 [doi]']",ppublish,Drug Metab Dispos. 2007 Mar;35(3):394-401. doi: 10.1124/dmd.106.012112.

(Arecaceae). The mesocarp flour obtained from their fruits has been used in Brazil as medicine in the treatment of pains, constipation, obesity, leukemia, rheumatism, ulcerations, tumors, inflammations and venous diseases. The effect of the chronic oral treatment with aqueous extract of babassu mesocarp (500mg/kgday) on the number of platelets, the prothrombin time (PT), the activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), the nitric oxide (NO) production and the carrageenin-induced thrombosis was evaluated, using C57Bl/6 mice. The chronic oral treatment with babassu mesocarp induced an anti-thrombotic effect. There was a 88.9% reduction in the necrosis of the tail. This effect seems to be related to an increase in the ability of the macrophage to produce NO and to a slow coagulation process associated to an increase of 12.0 and 13.9% in PT and aPTT, respectively. However, the anti-thrombotic effect seems to be not related to alterations in the number of platelets. It is possible to conclude that the oral treatment with babassu mesocarp has a significant anti-thrombotic effect, which could justify the popular use of babassu mesocarp in the treatment of venous diseases.

The apoptogenic efficiency of TRAIL in leukemic lymphocytes is linked to the long lasting increased ability of TRAIL to recognize and bind DR4 and DR5 receptors during hyperthermia. Here, we have analyzed whether this new apoptotic co-treatment could be relevant toward primary cells from patients suffering of chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Analysis of samples from 24 patients with different ages, sex and disease stages revealed that half of them had lymphocytes that, once isolated and analyzed in vitro, positively responded (increase of cell death) to the heat shock plus TRAIL co-treatment. Analysis of the level of expression of various anti-apoptotic proteins in the cell samples revealed a great heterogeneity between patients and no clear relationships could be drawn. Nevertheless, most cell samples that were sensitive to TRAIL plus heat shock induced apoptosis displayed a higher level of cell surface DR4 and DR5 receptors than the non-sensitive counterparts.

Recently, much evidence was provided that leukemia and tumor maintenance and growth are sustained by a small proportion of cells exhibiting stem cell properties. In neural tumors, stem cells have been detected in glioblastoma, medulloblastoma and ependymoma. These observations imply that normal stem cells could be the origin of cancer stem cells; alternatively, a more differentiated progeny may revert to a ""stem-like"" status, and give rise to cancer stem cells. In adult brain residual stem cells are located in the hippocampus, the subventricular zone and possibly the cerebellum. However, evidence for the ability of more differentiated progeny (astroglia, oligodendroglia) to convert into ""stem cells"" in vitro has also been provided, thus greatly expanding the potential target of oncogenic mutations. In the framework of the cancer stem cell hypothesis, genes originally identified as important for normal neural stem cells may be essential to support cancer stem cells as well. Stem cell genes act in several ways: they stimulate stem cell self-replication, inhibit differentiation, control excessive replication that might lead to ""exhaustion"" of the stem cell pool. Mutations in man and mouse, in spontaneous or experimental brain tumors, often target stem cell genes or genes lying in their functional pathway, the main examples being the Sonic hedgehog and the Wnt pathways. Interestingly, several stem cell genes are often overexpressed in brain tumors, even if they are not mutated. This suggests that these genes may be important for the generation of cancer stem cells from more differentiated precursors, or for cancer stem cell maintenance. Cancer stem cells partially differentiate in vivo, and in vitro they also give rise to seemingly normal differentiated progeny, like normal stem cells: thus, their main defect, leading to cancer, may lie in the unbalance between self-replication and terminal differentiation of this minority cell population. Knowledge of extrinsic diffusible factors affecting the activity of stem cell genes may help identifying tools for inducing cancer stem cell differentiation, which might be of use in therapy.","['Nicolis, Silvia K']",['Nicolis SK'],"['Department of Biotechnology and Biosciences, University of Milano Bicocca, piazza della Scienza 2, 20126 Milano, Italy. silvia.nicolis@unimib.it']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20061201,United States,Neurobiol Dis,Neurobiology of disease,9500169,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/genetics', 'Brain Neoplasms/*genetics', 'Cell Differentiation/genetics', 'Cell Division/genetics', 'Cell Lineage/genetics', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/*genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*physiology', 'Signal Transduction/genetics']",133,2006/12/05 09:00,2007/04/12 09:00,['2006/12/05 09:00'],"['2006/08/10 00:00 [received]', '2006/08/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2006/12/05 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/04/12 09:00 [medline]', '2006/12/05 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0969-9961(06)00215-4 [pii]', '10.1016/j.nbd.2006.08.022 [doi]']",ppublish,Neurobiol Dis. 2007 Feb;25(2):217-29. doi: 10.1016/j.nbd.2006.08.022.

Some evidence has suggested that CD133 is a marker for a subset of leukemia and glioblastoma cancer stem cells. Especially, CD133 positive cells isolated from human glioblastoma may initiate tumors and represent novel targets for therapeutics. The gene expression and the drug resistance property of CD133 positive cancer stem cells, however, are still unknown. RESULTS: In this study, by FACS analysis we determined the percentage of CD133 positive cells in three primary cultured cell lines established from glioblastoma patients 10.2%, 69.7% and 27.5%, respectively. We also determined the average mRNA levels of markers associated with neural precursors. For example, CD90, CD44, CXCR4, Nestin, Msi1 and MELK mRNA on CD133 positive cells increased to 15.6, 5.7, 337.8, 21.4, 84 and 1351 times, respectively, compared to autologous CD133 negative cells derived from cell line No. 66. Additionally, CD133 positive cells express higher levels of BCRP1 and MGMT mRNA, as well as higher mRNA levels of genes that inhibit apoptosis. Furthermore, CD133 positive cells were significantly resistant to chemotherapeutic agents including temozolomide, carboplatin, paclitaxel (Taxol) and etoposide (VP16) compared to autologous CD133 negative cells. Finally, CD133 expression was significantly higher in recurrent GBM tissue obtained from five patients as compared to their respective newly diagnosed tumors. CONCLUSION: Our study for the first time provided evidence that CD133 positive cancer stem cells display strong capability on tumor's resistance to chemotherapy. This resistance is probably contributed by the CD133 positive cell with higher expression of on BCRP1 and MGMT, as well as the anti-apoptosis protein and inhibitors of apoptosis protein families. Future treatment should target this small population of CD133 positive cancer stem cells in tumors to improve the survival of brain tumor patients.","['Liu, Gentao', 'Yuan, Xiangpeng', 'Zeng, Zhaohui', 'Tunici, Patrizia', 'Ng, Hiushan', 'Abdulkadir, Iman R', 'Lu, Lizhi', 'Irvin, Dwain', 'Black, Keith L', 'Yu, John S']","['Liu G', 'Yuan X', 'Zeng Z', 'Tunici P', 'Ng H', 'Abdulkadir IR', 'Lu L', 'Irvin D', 'Black KL', 'Yu JS']","['Maxine Dunitz Neurosurgical Institute, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, Los Angeles, CA, 90048, USA. liug@cshs.org']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20061202,England,Mol Cancer,Molecular cancer,101147698,"['0 (AC133 Antigen)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Glycoproteins)', '0 (PROM1 protein, human)', '0 (Peptides)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)']",IM,"['AC133 Antigen', 'Antigens, CD/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/genetics', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Gene Expression', 'Glioblastoma/*drug therapy/*genetics/immunology/pathology', 'Glycoproteins/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Humans', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/drug effects/immunology/*physiology', 'Peptides/genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis/genetics']",,2006/12/05 09:00,2006/12/21 09:00,['2006/12/05 09:00'],"['2006/06/19 00:00 [received]', '2006/12/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2006/12/05 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/12/21 09:00 [medline]', '2006/12/05 09:00 [entrez]']","['1476-4598-5-67 [pii]', '10.1186/1476-4598-5-67 [doi]']",epublish,Mol Cancer. 2006 Dec 2;5:67. doi: 10.1186/1476-4598-5-67.,,,,,PMC1697823,,"['R01 NS048959/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States', 'K23 NS002232/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States', '1R21 NS048879/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States', 'R21 NS048879/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States', '1R01 NS048959/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States', '1K23NS02232/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Accumulating evidence suggests that Tax, a transforming protein of HTLV-1 or HTLV-2, plays a crucial role in the distinctive pathogenesis of these two infections. We herein examined whether Tax2 by itself has a growth promoting activity in a mouse T-cell line CTLL-2, and compared the activity with that of Tax1. RESULTS: We found that Tax2 converts the cell growth of CTLL-2 from an interleukin(IL)-2-dependent growth into an independent one. Cyclosporine A, an inhibitor of transcription factor NFAT, inhibited the growth of two out of four Tax2-transformed CTLL-2 cells, but it had little effect on two Tax1-transformed cells. While the HTLV-2-transformed human T-cell lines produce a significant amount of IL-2, Tax2-transformed CTLL-2 cells only produced a minimal amount of IL-2. These results thus suggest that NFAT-inducible gene(s) other than IL-2 play a role in the cell growth of Tax2-transformed CTLL-2 cells. CONCLUSION: These results show that HTLV-2 Tax2 by itself has a growth promoting activity toward a T-cell line CTLL-2, and the CTLL-2 assay used in this study may therefore be a useful tool for comparing the activity of Tax2 with that of Tax1 in T-cells, thereby elucidating the mechanism of HTLV-1 specific leukemogenesis.","['Kondo, Rie', 'Higuchi, Masaya', 'Takahashi, Masahiko', 'Oie, Masayasu', 'Tanaka, Yuetsu', 'Gejyo, Fumitake', 'Fujii, Masahiro']","['Kondo R', 'Higuchi M', 'Takahashi M', 'Oie M', 'Tanaka Y', 'Gejyo F', 'Fujii M']","['Division of Virology, Niigata University Graduate School of Medical and Dental Sciences, 1-757 Asahimachi-Dori, Niigata 951-8510, Japan. rierie-j@d6.dion.ne.jp']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20061202,England,Retrovirology,Retrovirology,101216893,"['0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (Interleukin-2)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Line, Transformed', 'Cell Proliferation', '*Cell Transformation, Viral', 'Gene Products, tax/*physiology', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 2/pathogenicity/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-2/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'T-Lymphocytes/*cytology/*virology']",,2006/12/05 09:00,2007/01/20 09:00,['2006/12/05 09:00'],"['2006/08/18 00:00 [received]', '2006/12/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2006/12/05 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/01/20 09:00 [medline]', '2006/12/05 09:00 [entrez]']","['1742-4690-3-88 [pii]', '10.1186/1742-4690-3-88 [doi]']",epublish,Retrovirology. 2006 Dec 2;3:88. doi: 10.1186/1742-4690-3-88.,,,,,PMC1697825,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The newly revealed role of protein families involved in the apoptosis pathway, and resistance to cytotoxic therapies have opened new avenues for the development of novel anticancer strategies. We have established a novel strategy to rapidly obtain protein-targeted, instead of conventional DNA-targeted, apoptosis inducers as antitumor leads. First, a novel organic non-DNA intercalative compound S1 (8-oxo-3-thiomorpholin-4-yl-8H-acenaphtho[1,2-b]pyrrole-9-carbonitrile, M(W) = 331) was found with an IC50 of 10(-7)-10(-8) microM against diverse cancer cell lines. Further biological evaluation demonstrated that it was an apoptosis-inducer both in vivo and in vitro. The treatment of hydroperitoneum hepatoma cells (H22 cell line) with S1 at various concentrations (from 0.01 to 10 microM) for 24 h triggered these cells to enter the apoptosis process. The antitumor efficiency was also tested in the H22 xenotransplant models in mice. At a dosage of 0.3 mg kg(-1), S1 exhibited significant antitumor activity with a much longer survival time, a decrease in tumor size, and increased apoptosis cells in tumor tissue. More importantly, studies of the molecular mechanism of apoptosis induction by S1 revealed that S1 inactivated the Bcl-2 protein by binding to it, depolarizing the mitochondrial membrane, and then activating caspase 9, followed by caspase 3. Finally, structure-based virtual modification was performed by computer modeling. As a result, a derivative, S2 (8-oxo-3-[(thienylmethyl)amino]-8H-acenaphtho[1,2-b]pyrrole-9-carbonitrile, M(W) = 341) was identified that possessed a lower binding energy to Bcl-2, and demonstrated better antitumor potency, even on the Bcl-2-overexpressing human acute myeloid leukemia (HL-60) cells (IC50 = 1.3 microM) in vitro. S1 and S2 are the well-defined Bcl-2 inhibitors that give us a promising platform for the development of new therapeutic agents.","['Zhang, Zhichao', 'Jin, Liji', 'Qian, Xuhong', 'Wei, Meijiao', 'Wang, Yuanyuan', 'Wang, Jing', 'Yang, Yuanyuan', 'Xu, Qin', 'Xu, Yongting', 'Liu, Fengyu']","['Zhang Z', 'Jin L', 'Qian X', 'Wei M', 'Wang Y', 'Wang J', 'Yang Y', 'Xu Q', 'Xu Y', 'Liu F']","['State Key Laboratory of Fine Chemicals, Dalian University of Technology, Dalian 116012, China. zczhang@dlut.edu.cn']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Germany,Chembiochem,Chembiochem : a European journal of chemical biology,100937360,"['0 (8-oxo-3-thiomorpholin-4-yl-8H-acenaphtho(1,2-b)pyrrole-9-carbonitrile)', '0 (Acenaphthenes)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Pyrroles)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",IM,"['Acenaphthenes/*chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', '*Apoptosis', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'DNA/chemistry', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Inhibitory Concentration 50', 'Mice', 'Models, Biological', 'Models, Chemical', 'Models, Molecular', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*antagonists & inhibitors/*chemistry', 'Pyrroles/*chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Time Factors']",,2006/12/02 09:00,2007/04/18 09:00,['2006/12/02 09:00'],"['2006/12/02 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/04/18 09:00 [medline]', '2006/12/02 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/cbic.200600305 [doi]'],ppublish,Chembiochem. 2007 Jan 2;8(1):113-21. doi: 10.1002/cbic.200600305.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Aberrant glycosilation, typical of tumor cells, represents a key event in the induction of invasion and metastasis. Sialidases remove sialic acid residues from sialoconjugates and, in mammals, these enzymes have been proved to be involved in several cellular phenomena, including cell proliferation and differentiation, membrane function, and malignant transformation. Herein we show that only the lysosomal sialidase Neu1 and the plasma membrane-associated sialidase Neu3 are expressed in CFU-E erythroid precursors and K562 erythroleukemic cells. Tumour cells show much higher expression levels than CFU-E cells and, during differentiation, the content of the two enzymes progressively decreases. The sialoglycoconjugate pattern is different in the two cell types. In fact, the differentiating erythroid precursors show an increase of the typical erythrocyte sphingolipids, whereas K562 cells treated with butyrate show a marked increase of GD1a, GM2, PE, and ceramide. Finally, during differentiation the sialoglycoprotein content of erythroid cells shows a marked increase, and in K562 cells the process induces the synthesis of some sialoglycoprotein typical of the erythroid membrane. Overall, these results point out the great differences in sialoglycoconjugate and sialidase patterns exhibited by normal and tumour cells.","['Tringali, Cristina', 'Anastasia, Luigi', 'Papini, Nadia', 'Bianchi, Anna', 'Ronzoni, Luisa', 'Cappellini, Maria Domenica', 'Monti, Eugenio', 'Tettamanti, Guido', 'Venerando, Bruno']","['Tringali C', 'Anastasia L', 'Papini N', 'Bianchi A', 'Ronzoni L', 'Cappellini MD', 'Monti E', 'Tettamanti G', 'Venerando B']","['Department of Medical Chemistry, Biochemistry and Biotechnology, Faculty of Exercise Science, University of Milan, LITA-Segrate, via Fratelli Cervi 93, 20090 Segrate, Milan, Italy.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Glycoconj J,Glycoconjugate journal,8603310,"['0 (Glycolipids)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Sialoglycoproteins)', 'EC 3.2.1.18 (Neuraminidase)']",IM,"['*Cell Differentiation', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'Erythroid Precursor Cells/*cytology/*enzymology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Glycolipids/metabolism', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*enzymology/genetics', 'Neuraminidase/*genetics/*metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger', 'Sialoglycoproteins/*metabolism']",,2006/12/02 09:00,2007/10/17 09:00,['2006/12/02 09:00'],"['2006/12/02 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/10/17 09:00 [medline]', '2006/12/02 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s10719-006-9013-0 [doi]'],ppublish,Glycoconj J. 2007 Jan;24(1):67-79. doi: 10.1007/s10719-006-9013-0.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To determine the importance of Socs3 in mammary development, we generated mice in which Socs3 was deleted in mammary epithelial cells. No overt phenotype was evident during pregnancy and lactation, indicating that Socs3 is not a key physiological regulator of prolactin signalling. However, Socs3-deficient mammary glands exhibited a profound increase in epithelial apoptosis and tissue remodelling, resulting in precocious involution. This phenotype was accompanied by augmented Stat3 activation and a marked increase in the level of c-myc. Moreover, induction of c-myc before weaning using an inducible transgenic model recapitulated the Socs3 phenotype, and elevated expression of likely c-myc target genes, E2F-1, Bax and p53, was observed.

Most ATLL patients fare poorly with conventional chemotherapy; however, antiviral therapy with zidovudine (AZT) and interferon alpha (IFN-alpha) has produced long-term clinical remissions. We studied primary ATLL tumors and identified molecular features linked to sensitivity and resistance to antiviral therapy. Enhanced expression of the proto-oncogene c-Rel was noted in 9 of 27 tumors. Resistant tumors exhibited c-Rel (6 of 10; 60%) more often than did sensitive variants (1 of 9; 11%). This finding was independent of the disease form. Elevated expression of the putative c-Rel target, interferon regulatory factor-4 (IRF-4), was observed in 10 (91%) of 11 nonresponders and in all tested patients with c-Rel+ tumors and occurred in the absence of the HTLV-1 oncoprotein Tax. In contrast, tumors in complete responders did not express c-Rel or IRF-4. Gene rearrangement studies demonstrated the persistence of circulating T-cell clones in long-term survivors maintained on antiviral therapy. The expression of nuclear c-Rel and IRF-4 occurs in the absence of Tax in primary ATLL and is associated with antiviral resistance. These molecular features may help guide treatment. AZT and IFN-alpha is a suppressive rather than a curative regimen, and patients in clinical remission should remain on maintenance therapy indefinitely.","['Ramos, Juan Carlos', 'Ruiz, Phillip Jr', 'Ratner, Lee', 'Reis, Isildinha M', 'Brites, Carlos', 'Pedroso, Celia', 'Byrne, Gerald E Jr', 'Toomey, Ngoc L', 'Andela, Valentine', 'Harhaj, Edward W', 'Lossos, Izidore S', 'Harrington, William J Jr']","['Ramos JC', 'Ruiz P Jr', 'Ratner L', 'Reis IM', 'Brites C', 'Pedroso C', 'Byrne GE Jr', 'Toomey NL', 'Andela V', 'Harhaj EW', 'Lossos IS', 'Harrington WJ Jr']","['Division of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Medicine, University of Miami Miller School of Medicine, FL 33136, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antiviral Agents)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Interferon Regulatory Factors)', '0 (Interferon Type I)', '0 (MAS1 protein, human)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Mas)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-rel)', '0 (REL protein, human)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (interferon regulatory factor-4)', '4B9XT59T7S (Zidovudine)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antiviral Agents/therapeutic use', 'Cohort Studies', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/metabolism', 'Drug Resistance, Viral', 'Gene Expression', '*Genes, rel', 'Humans', 'Interferon Regulatory Factors/*genetics/metabolism', 'Interferon Type I/therapeutic use', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/drug therapy/*genetics/metabolism', 'Middle Aged', 'NF-kappa B/genetics', 'Nuclear Proteins/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Mas', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-rel', 'Recombinant Proteins', 'Zidovudine/therapeutic use']",,2006/12/02 09:00,2007/06/01 09:00,['2006/12/02 09:00'],"['2006/12/02 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/06/01 09:00 [medline]', '2006/12/02 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)41813-0 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2006-07-036368 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2007 Apr 1;109(7):3060-8. doi: 10.1182/blood-2006-07-036368.,,,,,PMC1852214,,"['U01 CA070058/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-10521/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA082274/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-082274/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U01-CA-070058/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Initial results are presented from a phase 2 study of 186 patients with imatinib-resistant or -intolerant chronic-phase CML (CML-CP) designed to further establish the efficacy and safety of dasatinib (70 mg twice daily). At 8-months' follow-up, dasatinib induced notable responses, with 90% and 52% of patients achieving complete hematologic and major cytogenetic responses (MCyR), respectively.

It has been reported that thiosemicarbazones (TSCs) are potent antitumor agents that inhibit Topo-II. The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between the in vitro and in vivo behavior of novel (64)Cu-TSC complexes and the expression of Topo-II activity. METHODS: Four (4)N-azabicyclo[3.2.2]nonane TSC derivatives (EPH142, EPH143, EPH144, and EPH270) were successfully radiolabeled with (64)Cu, to form lipophilic cations of the general formula [(64)Cu(L)]Cl, and the partition coefficient (logP) values were determined. One agent [(64)Cu-EPH270](+) was observed in vitro in cultured cell studies. The kinetics of 2 compounds, [(64)Cu-EPH144](+) and [(64)Cu-EPH270](+), were examined in mice bearing L1210 tumors and small-animal PET was conducted in mice bearing L1210 and PC-3 tumors, which expressed high and low levels of Topo-II, respectively. All data were compared with the activity and levels of Topo-II, as determined by a commercially available assay kit and western blot analysis. RESULTS: The 4 complexes were radiolabeled by incubation of (64)CuCl(2) with the ligand in ethanolic solution. The complexes were isolated in high radiochemical purity, as determined by radio-thin-layer chromatography and radio-high-performance liquid chromatography. The compounds were shown to be lipophilic with logP values ranging from 1.34 to 1.92. In biodistribution studies, good L1210 tumor uptake was noted ([(64)Cu-EPH144](+) at 1 h, 4.70 %ID/g [percentage injected dose per gram]; 4 h, 8.80 %ID/g; 24 h, 6.64 %ID/g; and [(64)Cu-EPH270](+) at 1 h, 2.58 %ID/g; 4 h, 6.00 %ID/g; 24 h, 4.80 %ID/g). Small-animal PET of animals with L1210 tumors (high Topo-II expressing) showed excellent tumor accumulation compared with that of animals with PC-3 tumors (low Topo-II expressing), and the L1210 tumor uptake was significantly reduced by coadministration of a Topo-II poison. CONCLUSION: Here we describe the characterization of a new class of copper-radiolabeled TSC analogs. We demonstrate that the accumulation of the (64)Cu-compounds is related to the expression levels of Topo-II in tumor tissue.","['Wei, Lihui', 'Easmon, Johnny', 'Nagi, Ravneet K', 'Muegge, Brian D', 'Meyer, Laura A', 'Lewis, Jason S']","['Wei L', 'Easmon J', 'Nagi RK', 'Muegge BD', 'Meyer LA', 'Lewis JS']","['Division of Radiological Sciences, Mallinckrodt Institute of Radiology, and Alvin J Siteman Cancer Center, Washington University School of Medicine, St Louis, MO 63110, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",,United States,J Nucl Med,"Journal of nuclear medicine : official publication, Society of Nuclear Medicine",0217410,"['0 (Bridged Bicyclo Compounds, Heterocyclic)', '0 (Radiopharmaceuticals)', '0 (Thiosemicarbazones)', 'EC 5.99.1.3 (DNA Topoisomerases, Type II)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Bridged Bicyclo Compounds, Heterocyclic/chemistry/*pharmacokinetics', 'DNA Topoisomerases, Type II/*metabolism', 'Female', 'Gene Expression', 'Leukemia L1210/*diagnostic imaging/*metabolism', 'Metabolic Clearance Rate', 'Mice', 'Organ Specificity', 'Positron-Emission Tomography/*methods', 'Radiopharmaceuticals/chemical synthesis/pharmacokinetics', 'Thiosemicarbazones/chemistry/*pharmacokinetics', 'Tissue Distribution']",,2006/12/02 09:00,2007/03/06 09:00,['2006/12/02 09:00'],"['2006/12/02 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/03/06 09:00 [medline]', '2006/12/02 09:00 [entrez]']",['47/12/2034 [pii]'],ppublish,J Nucl Med. 2006 Dec;47(12):2034-41.,,,,,,,"['1 P30 CA091842/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', '1 R24 CA083060/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R24 CA086307/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,

However, there are very few convincing reports of persistent pulmonary sequelae, as demonstrated by spirometry, radiology and pathology. The current study presents a case of a 13-yr-old female with T-cell acute lymphocytic leukaemia who developed persistent, severe, obstructive lung disease following an episode of SJS. A lung biopsy demonstrated bronchiolar submucosal fibrosis consistent with constrictive bronchiolitis, as well as eosinophilic micro-abscesses, which, to the current authors' knowledge, has not been previously described. The present study illustrates specific histopathological features that highlight a possible association between Stevens-Johnson syndrome, constrictive bronchiolitis and eosinophilic micro-abscesses. The eosinophils may be associated with permanent mucosal damage, as seen in the present case, by releasing mediators that have a pro-fibrogenetic role.

These genes are transcribed after the promyelocyte stage of differentiation, and transcription continues until cell death. In undifferentiated myeloid cells, homologous cis-elements in the CYBB and NCF2 genes are repressed by the homeodomain transcription factor HoxA10. During cytokine-induced myelopoiesis, tyrosine phosphorylation of HoxA10 decreases binding affinity for the CYBB and NCF2 cis-elements. This abrogates HoxA10-induced transcriptional repression as differentiation proceeds. Therefore, mechanisms involved in differentiation stage-specific HoxA10 tyrosine phosphorylation are of interest because HoxA10 phosphorylation modulates myeloid-specific gene transcription. In this study, we found that HoxA10 is a substrate for SHP2 protein-tyrosine phosphatase in undifferentiated myeloid cells. In contrast, HoxA10 is a substrate for a constitutively active mutant form of SHP2 in both undifferentiated and differentiating myeloid cells. Expression of such SHP2 mutants results in persistent HoxA10 repression of CYBB and NCF2 transcription during myelopoiesis. Both HoxA10 overexpression and activating SHP2 mutations have been described in human myeloid malignancies. Therefore, our results suggest that these mutations could cooperate, leading to decreased myeloid-specific gene transcription and functional differentiation block in myeloid cells with both defects.","['Lindsey, Stephan', 'Huang, Weiqi', 'Wang, Hao', 'Horvath, Elizabeth', 'Zhu, Chunliu', 'Eklund, Elizabeth A']","['Lindsey S', 'Huang W', 'Wang H', 'Horvath E', 'Zhu C', 'Eklund EA']","['Feinberg School of Medicine and the Robert H.

We identified lilli in a genetic screen based on the suppression of a lethal phenotype that is associated with ectopic expression of the transcription factor encoded by the segmentation gene runt in the blastoderm embryo. In contrast to other factors identified by this screen, lilli appears to have no role in mediating either the establishment or maintenance of engrailed (en) repression by Runt. Instead, we find that Lilli plays a critical role in the Runt-dependent activation of the pair-rule segmentation gene fushi-tarazu (ftz). The requirement for lilli is distinct from and temporally precedes the Runt-dependent activation of ftz that is mediated by the orphan nuclear receptor protein Ftz-F1. We further describe a role for lilli in the activation of Sex-lethal (Sxl), an early target of Runt in the sex determination pathway. However, lilli is not required for all targets that are activated by Runt and appears to have no role in activation of sloppy paired (slp1).

Because the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) pathway can rescue cancer cells from apoptotic signals, we investigated MAPK/ERK signaling in EHEB cells in response to CdA. We observed that CdA, at concentrations around its IC50, dose- and time-dependently increased the phosphorylation state of ERK 1/2 (p-ERK), indicating an activation of the MAPK/ERK pathway. This activation required CdA metabolism and de novo protein synthesis, and was independent on caspase activation. Interruption of ERK signaling, using the specific MEK inhibitors U-0126 and PD-98059, significantly enhanced CdA cytotoxicity, evaluated by the MTT assay. Drug interaction analysis showed synergism in the majority of combinations between CdA and MEK inhibitors tested. MEK inhibitors also dramatically increased apoptosis induced by CdA alone, evaluated by caspase-3 activation and poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) cleavage.

Update (September 2006)].,1506-18,"The updated recommendations presented here reflect new developments in the diagnostic work-up and immunotherapy of multiple sclerosis (MS) as well as optimization of medical care for MS patients. Monoclonal antibodies provide considerable improvement of treatment, but their use in basic therapy is restricted by their side effect profile. Thus, for the time being, natalizumab is only approved for monotherapy after basic treatment has failed or for rapidly progressive relapsing-remitting MS. In contrast, long-term data on recombinant beta-interferons and glatiramer acetate (Copaxone) show that even after several years no unexpected side effects occur and that a prolonged therapeutic effect can be assumed which correlates with the dose or frequency of treatment. Recently IFN-beta1b (Betaferon) was approved for prophylactic treatment after the first attack (clinically isolated syndrome, CIS). During treatment with beta-interferons, neutralizing antibodies can emerge with possible loss of effectivity. In contrast, antibodies play no role in treatment with glatiramer acetate. During or after therapy with mitoxantrone, serious side effects (cardiomyopathy, acute myeloid leukemia) appeared in 0.2-0.4% of cases. Plasmapheresis is limited to individual curative attempts in escalating therapy of a severe attack. According to the revised McDonald criteria, the diagnosis of MS can be made as early as the occurrence of the first attack (CIS). Recommendations for optimized care of MS patients are also new, thus implementing a resolution of the European Parliament.","['Rieckmann, Peter']",['Rieckmann P'],,['ger'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', 'Practice Guideline']",,Germany,Nervenarzt,Der Nervenarzt,0400773,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized)', '0 (Immunologic Factors)', '0 (Interferon Type I)', '0 (Natalizumab)', '0 (Peptides)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '145155-23-3 (Interferon beta-1b)', '5M691HL4BO (Glatiramer Acetate)', '77238-31-4 (Interferon-beta)', 'BZ114NVM5P (Mitoxantrone)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Drug Approval', 'Europe', '*Evidence-Based Medicine', 'Glatiramer Acetate', 'Humans', 'Immunologic Factors/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Interferon Type I/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Interferon beta-1b', 'Interferon-beta/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Mitoxantrone/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Multiple Sclerosis, Chronic Progressive/diagnosis/*drug therapy', 'Multiple Sclerosis, Relapsing-Remitting/diagnosis/*drug therapy', 'Natalizumab', 'Neurologic Examination/drug effects', 'Peptides/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic', 'Recombinant Proteins', 'Registries']",,2006/12/01 09:00,2007/10/19 09:00,['2006/12/01 09:00'],"['2006/12/01 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/10/19 09:00 [medline]', '2006/12/01 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s00115-006-2220-x [doi]'],ppublish,Nervenarzt. 2006 Dec;77(12):1506-18. doi: 10.1007/s00115-006-2220-x.,,,,Immunmodulatorische Stufentherapie der Multiplen Sklerose.

METHODS: A pharmacokinetic database of 61 patients was developed by combining MTX data obtained from 16 patients in a pharmacokinetic sub-study with data obtained for clinical care in other patients enrolled on the POG 9407 protocol. The data were analyzed for the first dose of MTX given to patients in induction/intensification therapy. Patients received MTX (4 g/m2) over 24 h at week 4 of therapy. Toxicity data were also reviewed to evaluate the incidence of common MTX toxicities during the first 6 weeks of therapy (the induction/intensification phase). RESULTS: Steady-state clearance (mean+/-standard deviation) for infants aged 0-6 months was 89+/-32 ml/min/m2 compared to 111+/-40 for infants aged 7-12 months (P=0.030). In the subgroup of infants aged 0-3 months the mean steady-state clearance was 84+/-30 ml/min/m2 (P=0.026 vs. the 7-12-month group). The incidence of renal toxicity (all grades) during induction/intensification therapy was 23% in the 0-3 months age group compared to 0% (for n=27) in the group 7-12 months of age (P=0.029). There were no significant differences in hepatoxicity or mucous membrane toxicity between age groups. CONCLUSIONS: A modest difference in steady-state MTX clearance is observed between younger infants (0-6 months) and older infants (7-12 months). Very young infants (0-3 months) also experienced a slightly higher incidence of renal toxicity during induction/intensification therapy. Steady-state clearance for the older infants is similar to values reported for children in other studies.,"['Thompson, Patrick A', 'Murry, Daryl J', 'Rosner, Gary L', 'Lunagomez, Simon', 'Blaney, Susan M', 'Berg, Stacey L', 'Camitta, Bruce M', 'Dreyer, ZoAnn E', 'Bomgaars, Lisa R']","['Thompson PA', 'Murry DJ', 'Rosner GL', 'Lunagomez S', 'Blaney SM', 'Berg SL', 'Camitta BM', 'Dreyer ZE', 'Bomgaars LR']","[""Texas Children's Cancer Center, Baylor College of Medicine, 6621 Fannin St MC, Houston, TX 77030-2399, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20061129,Germany,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol,Cancer chemotherapy and pharmacology,7806519,['YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)'],IM,"['Age Factors', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Male', 'Methotrexate/adverse effects/*pharmacokinetics', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/metabolism']",,2006/12/01 09:00,2007/05/16 09:00,['2006/12/01 09:00'],"['2006/07/14 00:00 [received]', '2006/11/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2006/12/01 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/05/16 09:00 [medline]', '2006/12/01 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s00280-006-0388-1 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol. 2007 May;59(6):847-53. doi: 10.1007/s00280-006-0388-1.

Controversy exists whether cytostatic agents induce the mitochondrial or death receptor pathway of apoptosis. In the mitochondrial pathway cytochrome C release and caspase-9 activation play a central role in the induction of apoptosis, while formation of a Death Inducing Signaling Complex (DISC) and caspase-8 activation have been reported to be essential in death receptor-induced apoptosis. Here, we show in human derived myeloid and lymphoblastic leukemia cell lines that caspase-8 plays a more important role than previously expected in apoptosis mediated via the mitochondrial pathway. We demonstrated in these malignant cells chemotherapy-induced apoptosis independent of the death receptor pathway, since blocking this pathway using a retroviral construct encoding Flice inhibitory protein (FLIP) did not inhibit drug-induced apoptosis or caspase-8 activation, while overexpression of Bcl-2 completely inhibited both events. Furthermore, we showed that activation of caspase-8 by cytostatic agents occurred downstream from mitochondria. Since caspase-8 plays a central role in both death receptor- and chemotherapy-induced apoptosis of malignant cells from patients with acute leukemia, therapeutic strategies focusing at modulation and activation of caspase-8 may be successful in the treatment of drug-resistant malignancies.","['de Vries, J F', 'Wammes, L J', 'Jedema, I', 'van Dreunen, L', 'Nijmeijer, B A', 'Heemskerk, M H M', 'Willemze, R', 'Falkenburg, J H F', 'Barge, R M Y']","['de Vries JF', 'Wammes LJ', 'Jedema I', 'van Dreunen L', 'Nijmeijer BA', 'Heemskerk MH', 'Willemze R', 'Falkenburg JH', 'Barge RM']","['Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Department of Hematology, Leiden University Medical Center, P.O.

As improved therapy for MCL is required and the mTOR pathway may be involved in its pathophysiology, the antiproliferative effects of RAD001 (everolimus), an mTOR inhibitor, against three MCL cell lines were investigated. As a single agent, RAD001 inhibited proliferation in MCL cell lines (Jeko1, SP49 and NCEB1) approximately 40-65% compared to diluent control cells. This was associated with G(1) cell-cycle arrest and reduced phosphorylation of the mTOR downstream target, 4E-BP1. Furthermore, combination drug studies revealed predominantly synergistic cytotoxicity with RAD001 and several secondary agents, including doxorubicin, vincristine or rituximab (components of the standard MCL regimen), as well as paclitaxel, vorinostat and bortezomib. These data indicate that single agent RAD001 is effective in inhibiting growth of MCL cells in vitro and combination studies with secondary agents further demonstrate synergistic cytotoxicity.

Our results suggest that, besides a weak association of childhood ALL with the 66A>G polymorphism, haplotypes within the MTRR gene may, in part, account for population-based differences in risk.","['Gast, A', 'Bermejo, J L', 'Flohr, T', 'Stanulla, M', 'Burwinkel, B', 'Schrappe, M', 'Bartram, C R', 'Hemminki, K', 'Kumar, R']","['Gast A', 'Bermejo JL', 'Flohr T', 'Stanulla M', 'Burwinkel B', 'Schrappe M', 'Bartram CR', 'Hemminki K', 'Kumar R']","['Division of Molecular Genetic Epidemiology, German Cancer Research Center, Heidelberg, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20061130,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '935E97BOY8 (Folic Acid)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Base Sequence', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'DNA, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Female', 'Folic Acid/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Genotype', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Odds Ratio', '*Polymorphism, Genetic', 'Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics', 'Reference Values']",,2006/12/01 09:00,2007/09/26 09:00,['2006/12/01 09:00'],"['2006/12/01 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/09/26 09:00 [medline]', '2006/12/01 09:00 [entrez]']","['2404474 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.leu.2404474 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2007 Feb;21(2):320-5. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2404474.

It commonly develops in immunocompromised patients, often after bone marrow transplantation (BMT). Aggressive surgical debridement by an external approach has been considered a central element of treatment. We describe our experience in endoscopic management of IA in BMT patients in a retrospective study. METHODS: Charts of BMT patients with IA in the past 5 years were reviewed. Demographic data, primary disease, comorbidities, signs and symptoms, blood test results, preparation for surgery, surgical technique, and outcome were recorded. RESULTS: Fourteen BMT patients, age ranging from 3 to 56 years, had sinonasal IA. The primary disease was acute myelogenous leukemia in 6, acute lymphoblastic leukemia in 3, chronic myeloblastic leukemia in one, severe combined immunodeficiency disease in 2, and myelodysplastic syndrome in 2 patients. Diagnosis was made by physical examination, biopsy, culture, and computed tomography scan. Treatment, including aggressive endoscopic debridement, a systemic antifungal medication, and local irrigations of amphotericin-B enabled eradication of IA in all patients. Seven patients required two or more operations. None required orbital exenteration or craniotomy. Six patients died of the primary illness or of comorbidities with no evidence of residual disease. Eight patients are alive. CONCLUSION: Early detection of IA in BMT patients enables aggressive treatment before the disease spreads into the orbit or brain. Proper preoperative preparation facilitates safe endoscopic surgery in patients with severe bleeding tendencies. Although sinonasal IA is lethal, endoscopic surgery is feasible and efficient, enabling excellent local control.","['Eliashar, Ron', 'Resnick, Igor B', 'Goldfarb, Abraham', 'Wohlgelernter, Jay', 'Gross, Menachem']","['Eliashar R', 'Resnick IB', 'Goldfarb A', 'Wohlgelernter J', 'Gross M']","['Department of Otolaryngology/Head & Neck Surgery, Hebrew University School of Medicine, Hadassah Medical Center, Jerusalem, Israel. ron@eliashar.com']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Laryngoscope,The Laryngoscope,8607378,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aspergillosis/etiology/*surgery', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/*adverse effects', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Endoscopy/*methods', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*complications/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Opportunistic Infections/etiology/*surgery', 'Paranasal Sinus Diseases/etiology/microbiology/*surgery']",,2006/12/01 09:00,2007/02/08 09:00,['2006/12/01 09:00'],"['2006/12/01 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/02/08 09:00 [medline]', '2006/12/01 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/01.mlg.0000245941.03953.5d [doi]'],ppublish,Laryngoscope. 2007 Jan;117(1):78-81. doi: 10.1097/01.mlg.0000245941.03953.5d.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Intensified remission induction (RI) therapy can also improve the treatment results for AML. Therefore, the current trial attempted to evaluate the efficacy and toxicity of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) priming and a dose intensification of Ara-C in RI chemotherapy for AML. METHODS: A total of 29 patients with newly diagnosed AML received G-CSF-priming RI chemotherapy consisting of idarubicin (12 mg/m2, days 1-3), G-CSF (150 microg/m2, days 3-8) and Ara-C (500 mg/m2, b.i.d., days 4-8), and the outcomes were compared with those of a historical group treated with a standard regimen consisting of idarubicin (12 mg/m2, days 1-3) and Ara-C (100 mg/m2, days 1-7). RESULTS: There was no difference in sex, age, subtype and cytogenetic risk between the two groups. The complete remission rate and treatment-related mortality were 72 and 17% for the G-CSF-primed group (p = 0.89) and 71 and 10% for the historical group (p = 0.32), respectively. The time to neutrophil recovery (25 vs. 24 days, p = 0.17) and platelet recovery (24 vs. 23 days, p = 0.23) did not differ significantly between the two groups. Similarly, the duration of fever was not significantly different (5 vs. 7 days, p = 0.58). Thirteen patients (45%) experienced fever and 5 patients (17%) manifested skin rashes during the G-CSF priming. After a median follow-up of 336 days, the 1-year overall survival, disease-free survival and event-free survival rates were 72 vs. 63% (p = 0.83), 74 vs. 56% (p = 0.059) and 53 vs. 38% (p = 0.32), respectively. CONCLUSION: The sensitization of leukemic cells with growth factors and dose intensification seem to be clinically applicable means to enhance the efficacy of RI chemotherapy only in selected patients with AML, thereby warranting further studies focusing on specific subgroups of AML patients.","['Baek, Jin Ho', 'Sohn, Sang Kyun', 'Kim, Dong Hwan', 'Kim, Jong Gwang', 'Yang, Deok-Hwan', 'Kim, Yoe-Kyeoung', 'Lee, Je-Jung', 'Kim, Hyeoung-Joon']","['Baek JH', 'Sohn SK', 'Kim DH', 'Kim JG', 'Yang DH', 'Kim YK', 'Lee JJ', 'Kim HJ']","['Department of Hematology/Oncology, Kyungpook National University Hospital, Daegu, Korea.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article']",20061128,Switzerland,Acta Haematol,Acta haematologica,0141053,"['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', 'ZRP63D75JW (Idarubicin)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/administration & dosage', 'Cytarabine/*administration & dosage', 'Female', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/*administration & dosage', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Mobilization', 'Humans', 'Idarubicin/*administration & dosage', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Pilot Projects', 'Remission Induction/*methods', 'Survival Analysis']",,2006/12/01 09:00,2007/03/03 09:00,['2006/12/01 09:00'],"['2006/03/30 00:00 [received]', '2006/08/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2006/12/01 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/03/03 09:00 [medline]', '2006/12/01 09:00 [entrez]']","['97386 [pii]', '10.1159/000097386 [doi]']",ppublish,Acta Haematol. 2007;117(2):109-14. doi: 10.1159/000097386.

In this study, we investigate the fate of the MLV capsid in cells expressing either the TRIM5alpha(hu) or Fv-1 restriction factor. The expression of TRIM5alpha(hu), but not Fv-1, specifically promoted the premature conversion of particulate N-MLV capsids within infected cells to soluble capsid proteins. The TRIM5alpha(hu)-mediated disassembly of particulate N-MLV capsids was dependent upon residue 110 of the viral capsid. Furthermore, the deletion or disruption of TRIM5alpha(hu) domains necessary for potent N-MLV restriction completely abrogated the disappearance of particulate N-MLV capsids observed with wild-type TRIM5alpha(hu).

Treatment of human promyelocytic leukemia NB4 cells with 0.5 microM As2O3 for 30 min induced no DNA breaks, as analyzed by a standard comet assay. However, breaks were detected if these cells were then digested with endonuclease III (EnIII), formamidopyrimidine-DNA glycosylase (Fpg), or a nuclear extract (NE) of NB4 cells. Using either H2O2-Fe treated nuclei or As2O3-treated cells, digestion with either NE or EnIII+Fpg generated the same amount of breaks, and subsequent treatment with EnIII+Fpg resulted in no increase in breaks in NE-digested cells and vice versa. The human cell lines, defective in nucleotide excision protein, such as XPA, XPD, and XPG, excised UVC-induced adducts less rapidly than normal fibroblasts, but excised As2O3-adducts at the same rate as the normal cells. Immunodepletion of the NE with antibody against OGG1 or MYH decreased the incision of DNA adducts induced by As2O3, NaAsO2, monomethylarsonic acid, and dimethylarsinic acid, while antibodies against XPA, XPB, XPD, XPF, or XPG, did not.

Here, we provide the first evidence for a direct role of AF4 in the regulation of transcriptional elongation by RNA polymerase II (Pol II). We demonstrate that mouse Af4 functions as a positive regulator of Pol II transcription elongation factor b (P-TEFb) kinase and, in complex with MLL fusion partners Af9, Enl and Af10, as a mediator of histone H3-K79 methylation by recruiting Dot1 to elongating Pol II. These pathways are interconnected and tightly regulated by the P-TEFb-dependent phosphorylation of Af4, Af9 and Enl which controls their transactivation activity and/or protein stability. Consistently, increased levels of phosphorylated Pol II and methylated H3-K79 are observed in the ataxic mouse mutant robotic, an over-expression model of Af4. Finally, we confirm the functional relevance of Af4, Enl and Af9 to the regulation of gene transcription as their over-expression strongly stimulates P-TEFb-dependent transcription of a luciferase reporter gene. Our findings uncover a central role for these proteins in the regulation of transcriptional elongation and coordinated histone methylation, providing valuable insight into their contribution to leukemogenesis and neurodegeneration. Since these activities likely extend to the entire ALF protein family, this study also significantly inputs our understanding of the molecular basis of FRAXE mental retardation syndrome in which FMR2 expression is silenced.","['Bitoun, Emmanuelle', 'Oliver, Peter L', 'Davies, Kay E']","['Bitoun E', 'Oliver PL', 'Davies KE']","['Department of Physiology, Anatomy and Genetics, Medical Research Council Functional Genetics Unit, University of Oxford, South Parks Road, Oxford OX1 3QX, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20061129,England,Hum Mol Genet,Human molecular genetics,9208958,"['0 (Aff2 protein, mouse)', '0 (Mllt10 protein, mouse)', '0 (Mllt3 protein, mouse)', '0 (Multiprotein Complexes)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', 'EC 2.1.1.- (Dot1l protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.1.1.- (Methyltransferases)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)', 'EC 2.7.- (Phosphotransferases)', 'EC 2.7.11.- (Positive Transcriptional Elongation Factor B)', 'EC 2.7.7.- (RNA Polymerase II)', 'EC 2.7.7.7 (DNA Polymerase II)', 'EC 3.4.25.1 (Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line', '*Chromatin Assembly and Disassembly', 'DNA Polymerase II/metabolism', 'Down-Regulation', 'HeLa Cells', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*genetics', 'Methylation', 'Methyltransferases/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Models, Biological', 'Multiprotein Complexes/metabolism', 'Nuclear Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Phosphotransferases/metabolism', 'Positive Transcriptional Elongation Factor B/metabolism', 'Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex/metabolism', 'RNA Polymerase II/*genetics', 'Signal Transduction', 'Transcription Factors/metabolism', '*Transcription, Genetic', 'Transcriptional Activation', 'Transfection']",,2006/12/01 09:00,2007/04/04 09:00,['2006/12/01 09:00'],"['2006/12/01 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/04/04 09:00 [medline]', '2006/12/01 09:00 [entrez]']","['ddl444 [pii]', '10.1093/hmg/ddl444 [doi]']",ppublish,Hum Mol Genet. 2007 Jan 1;16(1):92-106. doi: 10.1093/hmg/ddl444.

Some patients have an indolent disease whereas others undergo a more agressive presentation needing treatment. New therapeutics approaches are necessary for the treatment of B-CLL. Bortezomib (Btz), is a proteasome inhibitor, currently undergoing clinical trials whose function, at least in part, by stabilizing the IkappaBalpha protein and inhibiting NFkappaB activation. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this work was to study the effects of Btz on isolated human B-CLL cells, in vitro, and to correlate the differential rates of apoptosis induction with biological variables. MATERIAL AND METHODS: 31 B-CLL samples, from patients in stage A of Binet were used for this study, and the apoptotic effect of Btz on these cells was measured. RESULTS: Our data show that Btz treatment of B-CLL cells induces apoptosis in a time and dose-dependent manner. The apoptosis induction is mediated in part by inhibition of NFkappaB and is dependent on caspases activation. Interesting, in IgVH mutated cells, Btz have statistically significant differences in their in vitro activity on B-CLL cells according to their BCL-6 mutational status. CONCLUSIONS: Btz is a promising pharmacologic agent for the treatment of B-CLL, but its efficacy seems to be related to IgVH and BCL-6 mutational status, therefore, it could be interesting to further investigate the mechanisms involved in the different behavior of the cells in response to apoptosis induction by this drug.","['Jantus-Lewintre, Eloisa', 'Sarsotti, Elena', 'Terol, Maria Jose', 'Benet, Isabel', 'Garcia-Conde, Javier']","['Jantus-Lewintre E', 'Sarsotti E', 'Terol MJ', 'Benet I', 'Garcia-Conde J']",['Hospital Clinico Universitario de Valencia.

METHODS: Eighty-two cases of myeloid sarcoma were retrieved from the archives of Department of Pathology, West China Hospital of Sichuan University during the period from January, 1990 to February, 2005. The morphologic features were reviewed and classified according to the 2001 WHO classification for hematopoietic and lymphoid tissue tumors. Immunohistochemical study using a panel of 11 antibodies was performed on 73 cases. The survival data were collected and analyzed by SPSS 10.0. RESULTS: The median age of patients was 35.5 years. The male-to-female ratio was 1.4:1. The sites of occurrence included lymph node (43.1%), skin (16.7%), nose (7.8%), soft tissue (7.8%) and bone (6.9%). Fifty-one cases (62.2%) represented myeloid sarcoma associated with an underlying myeloproliferative disorder and 25 cases (30.5%) represented solitary myeloid sarcoma. As for the morphology, 79 cases (96.3%) were granulocytic sarcoma, including 41 cases (51.9%) blastic type, 25 cases (31.6%) immature type and 13 cases (16.5%) differentiated type. The other 3 cases (3.7%) were monoblastic sarcoma. Immature eosinophils were found in 51 cases (64.6%) of granulocytic sarcoma, among which 13 cases (31.7%) were of blastic type. Immunohistochemical study showed that 95.9% cases (70/73) were positive for myeloperoxidase, 95.5% (63/66) for lysozyme, 95.2% (60/63) for CD68 (KP1), 90.8% (59/65) for leukocyte common antigen, 85.7% (54/63) for CD43, 77.8% (49/63) for CD117, 58.7% (37/63) for CD99, 54.0% (34/63) for CD15, 22.2% (14/63) for CD34, and 4.7% (3/64) for CD68 (PG-M1). Proliferation index, as demonstrated by Ki-67 positivity, was 0.49+/-0.22. Follow-up data was obtained in 59 of the 82 patients. The two- and five-year survival rates were 36.1% and 17.3% respectively. No significant prognostic factors were found in the survival analysis. CONCLUSIONS: Myeloid sarcoma may precede, develop in a background of myeloproliferative disorder or even after remission of the disease. The presence of immature eosinophils is an important morphologic clue and immunohistochemical study plays an essential role in arriving at a correct diagnosis. Immunopositivity for myeloperoxidase is specific for granulocytic differentiation, while CD68 (PG-M1)-positivity suggests monocytic differentiation. Detailed clinicopathologic correlation is also helpful.","['Li, Ji-man', 'Liu, Wei-ping', 'Zhang, Ming-hu', 'Wei, Xi', 'Gu, Ji-min', 'Han, Ai-jun', 'Wu, Wen-qiao', 'Chen, Xin-yi']","['Li JM', 'Liu WP', 'Zhang MH', 'Wei X', 'Gu JM', 'Han AJ', 'Wu WQ', 'Chen XY']","['Department of Pathology, West China Hospital of Sichuan University, Chengdu 610041, China.']",['chi'],['Journal Article'],,China,Zhonghua Bing Li Xue Za Zhi,Zhonghua bing li xue za zhi = Chinese journal of pathology,0005331,"['0 (12E7 Antigen)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, Myelomonocytic)', '0 (CD68 antigen, human)', '0 (CD99 protein, human)', '0 (Cell Adhesion Molecules)', '0 (Ki-67 Antigen)', '0 (Leukosialin)', '0 (Lewis X Antigen)', 'EC 1.11.1.7 (Peroxidase)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit)']",IM,"['12E7 Antigen', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antigens, CD/metabolism', 'Antigens, CD34/metabolism', 'Antigens, Differentiation, Myelomonocytic/metabolism', 'Cell Adhesion Molecules/metabolism', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Ki-67 Antigen/metabolism', 'Leukosialin/metabolism', 'Lewis X Antigen/metabolism', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Peroxidase/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit/metabolism', 'Sarcoma, Myeloid/classification/*metabolism/*pathology', 'Young Adult']",,2006/12/01 09:00,2009/01/27 09:00,['2006/12/01 09:00'],"['2006/12/01 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/01/27 09:00 [medline]', '2006/12/01 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Zhonghua Bing Li Xue Za Zhi. 2006 Oct;35(10):606-11.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Despite enormous therapeutic efforts that range from various cytotoxic agents to allogeneic stem cell transplantation, overall survival of patients with AML remains unsatisfying. The poor survival rates are mainly due to therapy-related mortality, failure of induction chemotherapy and early relapses. Therefore, novel therapeutic agents that are more efficient and better tolerated are eagerly sought after. For existing therapeutic strategies, there is a lack of markers that are capable of reliably predicting prognosis or the therapeutic response prior to treatment. There is hope that elucidation of the AML-specific proteome will prompt the discovery of novel therapeutic targets and biomarkers in AML. Modern mass-spectrometry instrumentation has achieved excellent performance in terms of sensitivity, resolution and mass accuracy; however, so far, the contribution of proteomics to the care of patients with AML is virtually zero. This might be partly because mass spectrometry instrumentation and protein fractionation still lack true high-throughput capabilities with highest levels of reproducibility, thus hampering large-scale translational studies with clinical samples. Since mass-spectrometry instruments are very intricate devices, their successful operation will hinge on the willingness and ability of mass-spectrometry experts and clinical researchers to adopt new views, learn from each other and cooperate in order to ultimately benefit the patient suffering from AML. This review highlights some clinical problems circumventing the treatment of patients with AML. Furthermore, it provides a brief overview of the technical background of standard proteomics approaches and describes opportunities, challenges and pitfalls of proteomic studies with regards to AML.","['Czibere, Akos', 'Grall, Franck', 'Aivado, Manuel']","['Czibere A', 'Grall F', 'Aivado M']","['Heinrich Heine University, Department of Hematology, Oncology and Clinical Immunlogy, Moorenstr. 5, 40225 Dusseldorf, Germany. aczibere@bidmc.harvard.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,England,Expert Rev Anticancer Ther,Expert review of anticancer therapy,101123358,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)']",IM,"['Biomarkers, Tumor/analysis', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/mortality/*therapy', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics/isolation & purification', '*Proteomics/methods/trends', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Survival Analysis']",99,2006/12/01 09:00,2007/02/03 09:00,['2006/12/01 09:00'],"['2006/12/01 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/02/03 09:00 [medline]', '2006/12/01 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1586/14737140.6.11.1663 [doi]'],ppublish,Expert Rev Anticancer Ther. 2006 Nov;6(11):1663-75. doi: 10.1586/14737140.6.11.1663.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recently, its homologues such as p63 and p73 have been reported in human, mice and fish. Environmentally induced alterations in p53 protein have been reported to contribute to pathogenesis of leukemia in soft-shell clam Mya arenaria inhabiting polluted water, suggesting that p53 proteins can also be used as pollution markers. In the present study, the presence of p53 protein or its homologues was investigated in tissues of bivalve molluscs Lamellidens corrianus that are predominant in the freshwater riverine environment and are well suited to act as test organisms for evaluation of habitat degradation. The molluscs were collected live from the river Ganga at three sampling sites viz., Kanpur, Allahabad and Varanasi and different tissues (foot, gill and mantle) were collected. Proteins were analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). On immunoblot analysis, a 45 kDa protein (p45) was recognized by the monoclonal anti-p53 antibody in the molluscan tissues. The p45 showed immunoreactivity in all the three tissues of molluscs collected at Kanpur, in foot and gill tissues in those collected at Allahabad, and in foot tissue only, in those collected at Varanasi. Since monoclonal anti-p53 recognizes a denaturation-resistant epitope on the p53 (53 kDa) nuclear protein and does not react with other cellular proteins, the molluscan p45 is a p53-homologue or p53-like protein. Further, the differential expression of p45 in the different organs might serve as a useful biomarker that would help in establishing pollution gradient for environmental monitoring in the large aquatic ecosystems.","['Mohanty, B P']",['Mohanty BP'],"['Biochemistry and Biotechnology Lab, Riverine Fisheries Division, Central Inland Fisheries Research Institute, 24 Panna Lal Road, Allahabad 211 002, India. bimal.mohanty@abdn.ac.uk']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,India,Indian J Biochem Biophys,Indian journal of biochemistry & biophysics,0310774,"['0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Biochemistry/methods', 'Biomarkers/chemistry', 'Bivalvia', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'Fresh Water', '*Genes, p53', 'Immunoblotting', 'Mollusca', 'Proteins/chemistry', 'Temperature', 'Time Factors', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/*metabolism']",,2006/12/01 09:00,2007/01/12 09:00,['2006/12/01 09:00'],"['2006/12/01 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/01/12 09:00 [medline]', '2006/12/01 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Indian J Biochem Biophys. 2006 Aug;43(4):247-50.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This motif is a putative binding site for a repressor protein, termed beta protein 1 (BP1) (Berg et al., Nucleic Acids Res 1989;17:8833-8852). Variations in the (AC)n(AT)xTy repeats affect the binding affinity of BP1, thereby altering the expression of the beta-globin gene. Eight different configurations of this repeat motif are identified in our population of Chinese beta-thalassaemia patients. A (AC)3(AT)7T5 motif was identified among these thalassaemia patients and its influence in beta-globin gene expression was studied using stable transfection assay in murine erythroleukemia (MEL) cells. Our data demonstrated that the (AC)3(AT)7T5 motif has a moderately strong repressor effect on the expression of the cis-linked beta-globin gene. The high affinity of BP1 for this motif may result in the suppression of the transcription of the beta-globin gene (Berg et al., Am J Hematol 1991;36:42-47).

RESULTS: Overall, 80 patients (70%) achieved a response according to the modified International Working Group criteria (IWG): complete response (CR), 40 patients (35%); partial response, 2 patients (2%); bone marrow CR with or without other hematologic improvements (HI), 26 patients (23%); and other HI, 12 patients (10%). Cytopenias were improved in 50% of patients. The median remission duration was 20 months, and the median survival was 22 months. Mortality was 3% at 6 weeks and 7% at 3 months. In a multivariate analysis, poor prognostic factors for achieving IWG CR were MDS (vs chronic myelomonocytic leukemia), longer duration of MDS, and prior MDS therapy. For survival, independent adverse prognostic factors were chromosome 5 and/or 7 abnormalities, older age, and prior MDS therapy (excluding growth factors). CONCLUSIONS: The longer term experience with decitabine in MDS was favorable. Pretreatment prognostic factors may predict the outcome of patients who receive decitabine therapy for MDS.","['Kantarjian, Hagop M', ""O'Brien, Susan"", 'Shan, Jianqin', 'Aribi, Ahmed', 'Garcia-Manero, Guillermo', 'Jabbour, Elias', 'Ravandi, Farhad', 'Cortes, Jorge', 'Davisson, Jan', 'Issa, Jean-Pierre']","['Kantarjian HM', ""O'Brien S"", 'Shan J', 'Aribi A', 'Garcia-Manero G', 'Jabbour E', 'Ravandi F', 'Cortes J', 'Davisson J', 'Issa JP']","['Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas M.

We also aim to discuss in more detail the diagnosis and management of various hypereosinophilic syndromes including the clonal eosinophilias and those driven by abnormal cytokine-secreting T cells. RECENT FINDINGS: Our understanding of the causative genetic abnormalities in eosinophilic leukemia is increasing, as is the repertoire of techniques available to detect them. New treatments on the horizon include further tyrosine kinase inhibitors for use in eosinophilic leukemia, which should provide an alternative to imatinib for those patients who develop resistance. These may also prove useful for other hypereosinophilic syndromes without PDGFRA or PDGFRB rearrangements. Other new therapies including anti-IL5 monoclonal antibodies are proving beneficial for some patients, especially those with abnormal T-cell populations. SUMMARY: As our understanding of the various hypereosinophilic syndromes increases, and we are able to characterize many of the causative genetic lesions in the clonal eosinophilias, we are increasingly able to select appropriate therapy for an individual patient.

In this review we summarize our current knowledge on inheritance and pathophysiolgy of congenital neutropenia. RECENT FINDINGS: There are two major subtypes of congenital neutropenia as judged by inheritance: autosomal dominant trait defined by neutrophil elastase mutations consisting of 60% of patients and autosomal recessive trait comprising approximately 30% of patients. This genetic heterogeneity suggests that several pathologic mechanisms may lead to the same phenotype due to downregulation of common myeloid transcription factors. Lymphoid enhancer-binding factor 1 is the most promising candidate, as its abrogation together with downregulation of lymphoid enhancer-binding factor 1 target genes is compatible with this phenotype. Congenital neutropenia is considered as a preleukemic syndrome, since after 10 years of observation the cumulative incidence for leukemia is 21%. Acquired granulocyte colony-stimulating factor receptor mutations are detected in approximately 80% of congenital neutropenia patients who developed acute myeloid leukemia. SUMMARY: Congenital neutropenia is a congenital disorder of hematopoiesis inherited by autosomal dominant or recessive traits. Downregulation of lymphoid enhancer-binding factor 1 is involved in the pathophysiology of all congenital neutropenia patients. Congenital neutropenia patients with acquired granulocyte colony-stimulating factor receptor mutations define a group with high risk for development of leukemia.","['Skokowa, Julia', 'Germeshausen, Manuela', 'Zeidler, Cornelia', 'Welte, Karl']","['Skokowa J', 'Germeshausen M', 'Zeidler C', 'Welte K']","['Department of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, Medical University Hannover, Hannover, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,Curr Opin Hematol,Current opinion in hematology,9430802,"['0 (Lymphoid Enhancer-Binding Factor 1)', '0 (Receptors, Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', 'EC 3.4.21.37 (Leukocyte Elastase)']",IM,"['Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/therapeutic use', 'Humans', '*Inheritance Patterns', 'Leukocyte Elastase/genetics', 'Lymphoid Enhancer-Binding Factor 1/genetics', 'Neutropenia/*congenital/genetics/*physiopathology/therapy', 'Phenotype', 'Receptors, Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/genetics']",54,2006/11/30 09:00,2007/01/24 09:00,['2006/11/30 09:00'],"['2006/11/30 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/01/24 09:00 [medline]', '2006/11/30 09:00 [entrez]']","['00062752-200701000-00006 [pii]', '10.1097/00062752-200701000-00006 [doi]']",ppublish,Curr Opin Hematol. 2007 Jan;14(1):22-8. doi: 10.1097/00062752-200701000-00006.,['Curr Opin Hematol. 2007 Mar;14(2):181'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This review explores recent developments that have shed light on how two of the best-characterized suppressor of cytokine signaling proteins, SOCS1 and SOCS3, attenuate myeloid signaling pathways that lead to inflammation, hematological malignancy, and related disorders. RECENT FINDINGS: In addition to its 'classic' role as an inhibitor of IFNgamma signaling, a number of new regulatory roles in IFNalpha and toll-like receptor signaling have been defined for SOCS1, and substantial progress has been made in identifying the factors that give rise to lethal inflammation in Socs1 neonatal mice. The aberrant transcriptional regulation of suppressor of cytokine signaling genes in myeloid leukemia and related proliferative disorders has also been further defined. Finally, positive signs have emerged in mice that exogenous delivery of SOCS3 may be of therapeutic value.

Its incidence has been reported between 0.12% and 5%, although the majority of cases are anecdotal. The mechanisms of leukemogenesis in DCL may be distinct from other types of leukemia. Possible causes of DCL include oncogenic alteration or premature aging of transplanted donor cells in an immunosuppressed person. Although many studies have recently better characterized leukemic stem cells, it is important to also consider that both intrinsic cell factors and external signals from the hematopoietic microenvironment govern the developmental fate of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). Therefore, in cases of DCL, alteration of the microenvironment after HCT may increase the likelihood that some progeny of normal HSCs become leukemic. This complex intercommunication between cells, growth factors, and cytokines in the hematopoietic microenvironment are critical to balance HSC self-renewal, proliferation, and differentiation. However, this homeostasis is likely perturbed in the development of DCL, allowing unique insight into the stimuli that regulate normal and potentially abnormal hematopoietic development. In this article, we discuss the possible pathogenesis of DCL, its association with stem cells, and its likely dependence on a less-supportive stem cell niche.","['Flynn, Catherine M', 'Kaufman, Dan S']","['Flynn CM', 'Kaufman DS']","['Stem Cell Institute and Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology, Oncology, and Transplantation, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN 55455, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,,IM,"['Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Division', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*adverse effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*etiology/*pathology', 'Models, Biological', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*pathology', 'Tissue Donors']",68,2006/11/30 09:00,2007/06/01 09:00,['2006/11/30 09:00'],"['2006/11/30 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/06/01 09:00 [medline]', '2006/11/30 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)41763-X [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2006-07-021980 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2007 Apr 1;109(7):2688-92. doi: 10.1182/blood-2006-07-021980.,,['Blood. 2007 Dec 15;110(13):4621-2.

The population mean peak serum concentration of asparaginase enzymatic activity was 1 IU/mL, the elimination half-life was 7 days, and the volume of distribution was 2.43 L/m2. After the single dose, asparagine deamination was complete in all patients after 2 hours, and in 100%, 81%, and 44% on days 14, 21, and 28, respectively.

In this study, we made use of a new cellular system allowing us to reach graded expression of Spi-1 in preleukemic cells to dissect mechanisms of Spi-1/ PU-1 in erythroleukemogenesis. This system is based on conditional production of 1 or 2 spi-1-interfering RNAs stably inserted into spi-1 transgenic proerythroblasts. We show that Spi-1 knock-down was sufficient to reinstate the erythroid differentiation program. This differentiation process was associated with an exit from the cell cycle. Evidence is provided that in the presence of erythropoietin (Epo), Spi-1 displays an antiapoptotic role that is independent of its function in blocking erythroid differentiation. Apoptosis inhibited by Spi-1 did not involve activation of the Fas/FasL signaling pathway nor a failure to activate Epo receptor (EpoR). Furthermore, we found that reducing the Spi-1 level yields to ERK dephosphorylation and increased phosphorylation of AKT and STAT5, suggesting that Spi-1 may affect major signaling pathways downstream of the EpoR in erythroid cells. These findings reveal 2 distinct roles for Spi-1 during erythroleukemogenesis: Spi-1 blocks the erythroid differentiation program and acts to impair apoptotic death in cooperation with an Epo signaling.","['Rimmele, Pauline', 'Kosmider, Olivier', 'Mayeux, Patrick', 'Moreau-Gachelin, Francoise', 'Guillouf, Christel']","['Rimmele P', 'Kosmider O', 'Mayeux P', 'Moreau-Gachelin F', 'Guillouf C']","['Institut Curie, Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale (INSERM) Unite 528, Paris, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (Receptors, Erythropoietin)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (proto-oncogene protein Spi-1)', '11096-26-7 (Erythropoietin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/physiology', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Cycle/physiology', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Erythroblasts/pathology/physiology', 'Erythropoiesis/physiology', 'Erythropoietin/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*etiology/genetics/pathology/physiopathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*physiology', 'RNA, Small Interfering/genetics', 'Receptors, Erythropoietin/physiology', 'Signal Transduction/physiology', 'Trans-Activators/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*physiology']",,2006/11/30 09:00,2007/06/01 09:00,['2006/11/30 09:00'],"['2006/11/30 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/06/01 09:00 [medline]', '2006/11/30 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)41807-5 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2006-03-006718 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2007 Apr 1;109(7):3007-14. doi: 10.1182/blood-2006-03-006718.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PKB phosphorylates and inactivates members of the FOXO subfamily of Forkhead transcription factors. It has been suggested that hyperactivation of PKB maintains the leukemic phenotype through actively repressing FOXO-mediated regulation of specific genes. We have found expression of the transcriptional repressor Id1 (inhibitor of DNA binding 1) to be abrogated by FOXO3a activation. Inhibition of PKB activation or growth factor deprivation also resulted in strong down-regulation of Id1 promoter activity, Id1 mRNA, and protein expression. Id1 is highly expressed in Bcr-Abl-transformed K562 cells, correlating with high PKB activation and FOXO3a phosphorylation. Inhibition of Bcr-Abl by the chemical inhibitor STI571 resulted in activation of FOXO3a and down-regulation of Id1 expression. By performing chromatin immunoprecipitation assays and promoter-mutation analysis, we demonstrate that FOXO3a acts as a transcriptional repressor by directly binding to the Id1 promoter. STI571 treatment, or expression of constitutively active FOXO3a, resulted in erythroid differentiation of K562 cells, which was inhibited by ectopic expression of Id1. Taken together our data strongly suggest that high expression of Id1, through PKB-mediated inhibition of FOXO3a, is critical for maintenance of the leukemic phenotype.","['Birkenkamp, Kim U', 'Essafi, Abdelkader', 'van der Vos, Kristan E', 'da Costa, Marco', 'Hui, Rosaline C-Y', 'Holstege, Frank', 'Koenderman, Leo', 'Lam, Eric W-F', 'Coffer, Paul J']","['Birkenkamp KU', 'Essafi A', 'van der Vos KE', 'da Costa M', 'Hui RC', 'Holstege F', 'Koenderman L', 'Lam EW', 'Coffer PJ']","['Molecular Immunology Laboratory, Department of Immunology, University Medical Center, KC.02.085.2, Lundiaan 6, 3584-CX Utrecht, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20061127,United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Forkhead Box Protein O3)', '0 (Forkhead Transcription Factors)', '0 (FoxO3 protein, mouse)', '0 (Idb1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Inhibitor of Differentiation Protein 1)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Bone Marrow Cells/metabolism/pathology', '*Cell Differentiation/genetics', 'Cell Line, Transformed', '*Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'Down-Regulation', 'Forkhead Box Protein O3', 'Forkhead Transcription Factors/*genetics/metabolism', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', '*Genes, abl', 'Humans', 'Inhibitor of Differentiation Protein 1/*genetics/metabolism', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia/genetics/pathology', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/metabolism', 'Transcription, Genetic']",,2006/11/30 09:00,2007/04/10 09:00,['2006/11/30 09:00'],"['2006/11/30 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/04/10 09:00 [medline]', '2006/11/30 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0021-9258(20)72090-9 [pii]', '10.1074/jbc.M606669200 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2007 Jan 26;282(4):2211-20. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M606669200.

However, whether common variation in these genes has a role in the development of breast cancer or breast cancer survival in humans is still not clear. METHODS: We performed a comprehensive haplotype analysis of the ATM, CHEK2 and ERBB2 genes in a Swedish population-based study, which included 1,579 breast cancer cases and 1,516 controls. We followed the cases for 8.5 years, on average, and retrieved information on the date and cause of death during that period from the nationwide Swedish causes of death registry. We selected seven haplotype-tagging SNPs (tagSNPs) in the ATM gene, six tagSNPs in the CHEK2 gene and seven tagSNPs in the ERBB2 gene that predicted both haplotypic and single locus variations in the respective genes with R2 values > or = 0.8. These tagSNPs were genotyped in the complete set of cases and controls. We computed expected haplotype dosages of the tagSNP haplotypes and included the dosages as explanatory variables in Cox proportional hazards or logistic regression models. RESULTS: We found no association between any genetic variation in the ATM, CHEK2 or ERBB2 genes and breast cancer survival or the risk of developing tumours with certain characteristics. CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that common variants in the ATM, CHEK2 or ERBB2 genes are not involved in modifying breast cancer survival or the risk of tumour-characteristic-defined breast cancer.","['Einarsdottir, Kristjana', 'Rosenberg, Lena U', 'Humphreys, Keith', 'Bonnard, Carine', 'Palmgren, Juni', 'Li, Yuqing', 'Li, Yi', 'Chia, Kee S', 'Liu, Edison T', 'Hall, Per', 'Liu, Jianjun', 'Wedren, Sara']","['Einarsdottir K', 'Rosenberg LU', 'Humphreys K', 'Bonnard C', 'Palmgren J', 'Li Y', 'Li Y', 'Chia KS', 'Liu ET', 'Hall P', 'Liu J', 'Wedren S']","['Department of Medical Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Karolinska Institute, Nobels vag 12A, 171 77 Solna, Sweden.

In eukaryotic systems where RNA is limiting, established protocols for amplification of mRNA, which rely on the poly(A) tails, are well established. In contrast, the difficulty in amplifying prokaryotic mRNA has limited the application of microarrays to microbiology. Here we present a method for the Linear Amplification of Prokaryotic Transcripts (LAPT) that is efficient and unbiased. The overhang tailing activity of Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase is used to add the T7 promoter to cDNAs during reverse transcription. The promoter addition is uncoupled from the initial priming event allowing the promoter to be attached to the 5' end of the RNA transcript. This enables the amplification of sense-stranded RNA that is representative of the complexity and distribution of the original transcript pool. In microarray assays amplified prokaryotic RNA (10 ng total RNA starting material) showed good Spearman correlations to an unamplified control sample. Using genome-directed primers to bias addition of a T7-promoter to bacterial transcripts allowed amplification of prokaryotic transcripts in the presence of mammalian RNA (at a eukaryotic/prokaryotic RNA ratio of 500 to 1). This technology should facilitate the study of prokaryotic transcriptomes in situations, such as in vivo studies or mixed microbial populations, where the prokaryotic RNA amount is limited and/or the nontarget/target RNA ratios is high.","['Lawson, Jonathan N', 'Johnston, Stephen Albert']","['Lawson JN', 'Johnston SA']","['Program in Molecular Microbiology, University of Texas-Southwestern Medical School, Dallas, Texas, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",,United States,DNA Cell Biol,DNA and cell biology,9004522,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (RNA, Bacterial)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Bacteriophage T7', 'DNA Primers', 'Mice', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/enzymology', 'Nucleic Acid Amplification Techniques/*methods', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', '*Prokaryotic Cells', '*RNA, Bacterial', '*RNA, Messenger', 'RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase/chemistry', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Yersinia pestis/genetics', 'Yersinia pseudotuberculosis/genetics']",,2006/11/30 09:00,2006/12/21 09:00,['2006/11/30 09:00'],"['2006/11/30 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/12/21 09:00 [medline]', '2006/11/30 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1089/dna.2006.25.627 [doi]'],ppublish,DNA Cell Biol. 2006 Nov;25(11):627-34. doi: 10.1089/dna.2006.25.627.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In our previous study, we identified novel variants of polyhistidine repeat tract in HOXA1 gene and showed that ectopic expression of expanded variants led to enhanced intranuclear aggregation and accelerated cell death in a time-dependent manner. Here, we further investigate the implications of polyhistidine variants on HOXA1 function. Aside from intranuclear aggregation, we observed cytosolic aggregates during the early stages of expression. Rapamycin, an autophagy inducer, resulted in decreased protein aggregation and cell death. Here, we also show an interaction between variants of HOXA1 and one of the HOX protein known cofactors, PBX1. Expanded HOXA1 variants exhibited reduced PBX1-coupled transcriptional activity through a regulatory enhancer of HOXB1. Moreover, we demonstrate that both deleted and expanded variants inhibited neurite outgrowth in retinoic acid-induced neuronal differentiation in neuroblastoma cells. These results provide further evidence that expanded polyhistidine repeats in HOXA1 enhance aggregation and cell death, resulting in impaired neuronal differentiation and cooperative binding with PBX1.","['Paraguison, Rubigilda C', 'Higaki, Katsumi', 'Yamamoto, Kenji', 'Matsumoto, Hideo', 'Sasaki, Tsukasa', 'Kato, Nobumasa', 'Nanba, Eiji']","['Paraguison RC', 'Higaki K', 'Yamamoto K', 'Matsumoto H', 'Sasaki T', 'Kato N', 'Nanba E']","['Division of Functional Genomics, Research Center for Bioscience and Technology, Tottori University, Yonago, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,J Neurosci Res,Journal of neuroscience research,7600111,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (Pre-B-Cell Leukemia Transcription Factor 1)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (homeobox A1 protein)', '0 (pbx1 protein, human)', '26062-48-6 (polyhistidine)', '4QD397987E (Histidine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Autophagy', 'COS Cells', 'Cell Aggregation', 'Cell Death', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Line', 'Chlorocebus aethiops', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', '*Genetic Variation', 'Genetic Vectors', 'Histidine', 'Homeodomain Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Neurons/*cytology/physiology', 'Pre-B-Cell Leukemia Transcription Factor 1', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Recombinant Proteins/metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics/metabolism', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Transfection']",,2006/11/30 09:00,2007/05/15 09:00,['2006/11/30 09:00'],"['2006/11/30 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/05/15 09:00 [medline]', '2006/11/30 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/jnr.21137 [doi]'],ppublish,J Neurosci Res. 2007 Feb 15;85(3):479-87. doi: 10.1002/jnr.21137.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the last 4 years, several transgenic mouse models for B-CLL were generated. Investigations of these mouse models revealed that deregulation of three pathways, Tcl1-Akt pathway, TNF-NF-kB pathway, and Bcl2-mediated anti-apoptotic pathway, result in the development of B-CLL. While deregulation of TCL1 alone caused a B-CLL phenotype in mice, overexpression of Bcl2 required aberrantly activated TNF-NF-kB pathway signaling to yield the disease phenotype.

Though induction of ICAM-1 by 12-O-tetradecanoyl-phorbol-13-acetate (TPA) in myeloid cells has been reported, the molecular mechanism by which TPA upregulates ICAM-1 expression remains unclear. In the present study, we investigated the signaling mechanism associated with TPA-induced ICAM-1 expression in ML-1 cells. Herein, our microarray, flow cytometry, and Western blot analysis indicated that ICAM-1 was constitutively expressed at a low level in ML-1 cells, but its expression was further upregulated at both the mRNA and protein levels in response to TPA. ICAM-1 expression in response to TPA was inhibited by pretreatment with GF109203X [a specific inhibitor of protein kinase C (PKC)], or with PD98059 and U0126 (specific inhibitors of MEK), suggesting the importance of PKC, and Erk1/2 signaling cascades in this response. Interestingly, ICAM-1 expression in response to TPA-induced PKC activation was linked to the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), as pretreatment with NAC (an ROS scavenger) blocked both ErK1/2 activation and ICAM-1 expression induced by TPA. In addition, TPA-induced ICAM-1 expression was blocked by inhibition of nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) activation following pretreatment with BAY11-7085 (a specific inhibitor of NF-kappaB activation). TPA-induced NF-kappaB activation was shown by increased degradation of IkB (NF-kappaB specific inhibitory protein). Together, these observations demonstrated that TPA, a potent activator of PKC, induces ICAM-1 expression via a ROS- and ERK1/2-dependent signaling mechanism in ML-1 cells.","['Traore, Kassim', 'Sharma, Rajni B', 'Burek, C Lynne', 'Trush, Michael A']","['Traore K', 'Sharma RB', 'Burek CL', 'Trush MA']","['Department of Environmental Health Sciences, Bloomberg School of Public Health, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD 21205, USA. ktraore@jhsph.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",,United States,J Cell Biochem,Journal of cellular biochemistry,8205768,"['0 (BAY 11-7085)', '0 (Butadienes)', '0 (Flavonoids)', '0 (Indoles)', '0 (Maleimides)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Nitriles)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '0 (Sulfones)', '0 (U 0126)', '126547-89-5 (Intercellular Adhesion Molecule-1)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'L79H6N0V6C (bisindolylmaleimide I)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)', 'SJE1IO5E3I (2-(2-amino-3-methoxyphenyl)-4H-1-benzopyran-4-one)']",IM,"['Blotting, Western', 'Butadienes/pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases/metabolism/physiology', 'Flavonoids/pharmacology', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Indoles/pharmacology', 'Intercellular Adhesion Molecule-1/*genetics/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Maleimides/pharmacology', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism/physiology', 'Models, Biological', 'NF-kappa B/metabolism/physiology', 'Nitriles/pharmacology', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Protein Kinase C/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism/physiology', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Sulfones/pharmacology', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/*pharmacology']",,2006/11/30 09:00,2007/04/17 09:00,['2006/11/30 09:00'],"['2006/11/30 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/04/17 09:00 [medline]', '2006/11/30 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/jcb.21101 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cell Biochem. 2007 Mar 1;100(4):1010-21. doi: 10.1002/jcb.21101.,,,,,,,"['P30 ES 03819/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 ES 07141/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: The authors reviewed the case files of 926 consecutive patients who underwent allo-HSCT at their institution between 1985 and 2003. RESULTS: Twenty-eight patients developed 30 solid malignancies at a median of 6.8 years after allo-HSCT (range, 0.12-17.3 years) for a 10-year cumulative incidence of 3.1% (95% confidence interval [95% CI], 2-5%; all solid tumors) and 2.3% (95% CI 1-4%; excluding basal cell carcinoma and carcinoma in situ). The risk ratio of developing a second solid malignancy after allografting, compared with the general population of British Columbia adjusted for age and sex, was 1.85 (95% CI, 1.04-3.06; P = .019). In multivariate analysis, recipient age at allo-HSCT >40 years (P = .005) and having a woman donor (P = .0008) were associated with a greater risk of developing a second solid cancer. CONCLUSIONS: The authors concluded that patients undergoing allografting are at increased risk of developing a second solid cancer compared with the general population, particularly those of advanced age at the time of allograft. It is noteworthy that patients who had women as graft donors had an increased risk for developing a second solid cancer. This unexpected finding is a new observation and has not been reported previously.

We assessed risk of second cancers associated with family history of any cancer in 41,181 patients with Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) (n = 7,476), non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) (n = 25,941), or chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) (n = 7,764), using a large population-based database. Family history of cancer was based on a diagnosis of any cancer in 110,862 first-degree relatives. We found increased relative risk (RR) (1.81, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.04-3.16) of breast cancer among HL patient with positive (vs. negative) family history of cancer. Among CLL patients with positive (vs. negative) family history of cancer, we observed elevated risks of bladder (RR = 3.53, 95% CI: 1.31-9.55) and prostate cancer (RR = 2.15, 95% CI: 1.17-3.94). For NHL patients with positive (vs. negative) family history of cancer, we observed non-significantly increased risk of non-melanoma skin cancer (RR = 1.94, 95% CI: 0.86-4.38) and lung cancer (RR = 1.99, 95% CI: 0.73-5.39). Our observations suggest that genetic factors, as measured by positive family history of cancer, may be influential risk-factors for selected second tumors following lymphoproliferative disorders.","['Landgren, Ola', 'Pfeiffer, Ruth M', 'Stewart, Laveta', 'Gridley, Gloria', 'Mellemkjaer, Lene', 'Hemminki, Kari', 'Goldin, Lynn R', 'Travis, Lois B']","['Landgren O', 'Pfeiffer RM', 'Stewart L', 'Gridley G', 'Mellemkjaer L', 'Hemminki K', 'Goldin LR', 'Travis LB']","['Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics, National Cancer Institute, NIH, DHHS, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA. landgreo@mail.nih.gov']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Female', 'Hodgkin Disease/*diagnosis', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*diagnosis', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/*diagnosis', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/*epidemiology', 'Risk Factors']",,2006/11/30 09:00,2007/03/14 09:00,['2006/11/30 09:00'],"['2006/11/30 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/03/14 09:00 [medline]', '2006/11/30 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ijc.22414 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Cancer. 2007 Mar 1;120(5):1099-102. doi: 10.1002/ijc.22414.,,,,,,"['Copyright 2006 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the lichens themselves, W and Co are significantly higher within Fallon than in the combined control site outside of Fallon. In the rock substrates of the lichens, no differences exist in W and Co. The W and Co differences in lichens cannot be attributed to substrate geochemistry.

The World Health Organisation (WHO) classification of haematopoietic malignancies distinguishes MPDs from myelodysplastic/ myeloproliferative disorders and systemic mastocytosis. These malignancies frequently involve constitutive tyrosine kinase activity, resulting from either oncogenic fusion protein production or from point mutations. Chronic myelogenous leukaemia is the model used for studies of the consequences of such molecular defects. However, the heterogeneity of the clinical course of MPDs should be seen in a more rationale conceptual framework, including the many molecular events associated with these diseases. This review focuses on the various tyrosine kinase-related molecular mechanisms underlying both MPDs and rare diseases with myeloproliferative features.

In this study, ATP- but not PMA-induced PLD stimulation in CLL B-lymphocytes was abolished in the presence of an anti-P2X(7) receptor monoclonal antibody, as well as in B-lymphocytes from CLL subjects homozygous for the Glu(496) to Ala loss-of-function P2X(7) polymorphism.

In contrast, both inhibitors impaired PLD activity stimulated by PMA, a known mediator of PKC activation. The inhibition of P2X(7)-stimulated PLD activity by rottlerin was attributed to a target downstream of P2X(7) activation, as the ATP-mediated (86)Rb(+) efflux from CLL B-lymphocytes was not altered in the presence of rottlerin.

Here, we demonstrate that rottlerin, a putative protein kinase C-delta (PKCdelta)-specific inhibitor, acts synergistically with imatinib to induce apoptosis of BCR/ABL-expressing K562 and Ton.B210 cells. However, rottlerin inhibited neither PKCdelta nor BCR/ABL in these cells. On the other hand, rottlerin, previously characterized also as a mitochondrial uncoupler, transiently but significantly reduced mitochondrial membrane potential and gradually induced mitochondrial membrane permeabilization. Moreover, two other mitochondrial uncouplers, FCCP and DNP, very similarly induced apoptosis of BCR/ABL-expressing cells in a synergistic manner with imatinib. Imatinib synergistically enhanced mitochondrial membrane permeabilization induced by mitochondrial uncouplers, which led to release of cytochrome c into the cytoplasm and activation of caspases-3 and -9. Rottlerin also enhanced the cytotoxic effect of imatinib in leukemic cells from patients with CML blast crisis and Ph-positive ALL or a cell line expressing the imatinib-resistant E255K BCR/ABL mutant. The present study indicates that rottlerin synergistically enhances imatinib-induced apoptosis through its mitochondrial uncoupling effect independent of PKCdelta and may contribute to the development of new treatment strategy to overcome the imatinib resistance and to cure the BCR/ABL expressing leukemias.","['Kurosu, T', 'Tsuji, K', 'Kida, A', 'Koyama, T', 'Yamamoto, M', 'Miura, O']","['Kurosu T', 'Tsuji K', 'Kida A', 'Koyama T', 'Yamamoto M', 'Miura O']","['Department of Hematology, Graduate School of Medicine, Tokyo Medical and Dental University, Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20061127,England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (Acetophenones)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Benzopyrans)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Uncoupling Agents)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'E29LP3ZMUH (rottlerin)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C-delta)']",IM,"['Acetophenones/*chemistry/pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', '*Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Benzamides', 'Benzopyrans/*chemistry/pharmacology', 'Drug Synergism', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/drug therapy/enzymology', 'Mice', 'Mitochondria/drug effects/enzymology/metabolism', 'Piperazines/*pharmacology', 'Protein Kinase C-delta/*physiology', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*chemistry/pharmacology', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Pyrimidines/*pharmacology', 'Uncoupling Agents/*chemistry/pharmacology', 'Up-Regulation/drug effects']",,2006/11/30 09:00,2007/06/26 09:00,['2006/11/30 09:00'],"['2006/11/30 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/06/26 09:00 [medline]', '2006/11/30 09:00 [entrez]']","['1210117 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.onc.1210117 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2007 May 10;26(21):2975-87. doi: 10.1038/sj.onc.1210117.

An internal 24 hour time keeping system (biological clock) regulated by melatonin, controls the sleep-wake cycle. Melatonin production is a highly conserved evolutionary phenomenon. The indole hormone is synthesized in the pinealocytes derived from photoreceptors. Altered patterns and/or levels of melatonin secretion have been reported to coincide with sleep disorders, jetlag, depression, stress, reproductive activities, some forms of cancer and immunological disorders. Lately, the physiological and pathological role of melatonin has become a priority area of investigation, particularly in breast cancer, melanoma, colon cancer, lung cancer and leukemia. According to the 'melatonin hypothesis' of cancer, the exposure to light at night (LAN) and anthropogenic electric and magnetic fields (EMFs) is related to the increased incidence of breast cancer and childhood leukaemia via melatonin disruption. Melatonin's hypothermic, antioxidant and free radical scavenging properties, attribute it to an immunomodulator and an oncostatic agent as well. Many clinical studies have envisaged the potential therapeutic role of melatonin in various pathophysiological disorders, particularly cancer. A substantial reduction in risk of death and low adverse effects were reported from various randomized controlled trials of melatonin treatment in cancer patients. This review summarizes the physiological significance of melatonin and its potential role in cancer therapy.

In the process of generating BCR-ABL fusion, the deletion of residual BCR or ABL occurs in 15-30 percent of CML patients. In addition, some rearrangements are complex, and do not yield the ABL/BCR fusion due to the involvement of a third chromosome in the rearrangement. The possible role of these deletions and complex rearrangements in disease outcome is an ongoing topic of research. We report our results of cytogenetic analysis with GTG banding and fluorescence in situ hybridization using dual color dual fusion probe (D-FISH) from Vysis Inc, USA in 169 (109 male and 60 female) CML patients registered at The Gujarat Cancer and Research Institute (GC and RI) from April 2004 to December 2005.

Out of 57 cases with atypical FISH patterns, 22 included metaphase FISH results, and the rest had only interphase FISH performed. In addition to the hallmark Philadelphia chromosome, other chromosomal aberrations in CML revealed heterogeneity of molecular events. Pooling of more data may lead to identification of new CML sub-groups and hence help in the analysis of clinical trials.

We show that deregulated Syk activity allows growth factor-independent proliferation and transforms bone marrow-derived pre-B cells that are then able to induce leukemia in mice. Syk-transformed pre-B cells show a characteristic pattern of tyrosine phosphorylation, increased c-Myc expression, and defective differentiation. Treatment of Syk-transformed pre-B cells with a novel Syk-specific inhibitor (R406) reduces tyrosine phosphorylation and c-Myc expression. In addition, R406 treatment removes the developmental block and allows the differentiation of the Syk-transformed pre-B cells into immature B cells. Because R406 treatment also prevents the proliferation of c-Myc-transformed pre-B cells, our data indicate that endogenous Syk kinase activity may be required for the survival of pre-B cells transformed by other oncogenes. Collectively, our data suggest that Syk is a protooncogene involved in the transformation of lymphocytes, thus making Syk a potential target for the treatment of leukemia.","['Wossning, Thomas', 'Herzog, Sebastian', 'Kohler, Fabian', 'Meixlsperger, Sonja', 'Kulathu, Yogesh', 'Mittler, Gerhard', 'Abe, Akihiro', 'Fuchs, Uta', 'Borkhardt, Arndt', 'Jumaa, Hassan']","['Wossning T', 'Herzog S', 'Kohler F', 'Meixlsperger S', 'Kulathu Y', 'Mittler G', 'Abe A', 'Fuchs U', 'Borkhardt A', 'Jumaa H']","[""Institute of Biology III, Albert-Ludwigs-University of Freiburg, 79104 Freiburg, and Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Children's Hospital, Munich, Germany.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20061127,United States,J Exp Med,The Journal of experimental medicine,2985109R,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (B cell linker protein)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0', '(N4-(2,2-dimethyl-3-oxo-4H-pyrid(1,4)oxazin-6-yl)-5-fluoro-N2-(3,4,5-trimethoxyph', 'enyl)-2,4-pyrimidinediamine)', '0 (Oxazines)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc)', '0 (Pyridines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Rag2 protein, mouse)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (SYK protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Syk Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Syk protein, mouse)', 'EC 3.1.4.3 (Phospholipase C gamma)']",IM,"['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing/genetics/metabolism', 'Adoptive Transfer', 'Animals', 'B-Lymphocytes/drug effects/*metabolism/transplantation', 'Benzamides', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects/*physiology', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/pharmacology/physiology', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Leukemia/genetics/pathology/therapy', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Oxazines/pharmacology', 'Phospholipase C gamma/genetics/metabolism', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Piperazines/pharmacology', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc/genetics/metabolism', 'Pyridines/pharmacology', 'Pyrimidines/pharmacology', 'Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell/genetics', 'Spleen/drug effects/metabolism/pathology', 'Syk Kinase', 'Transfection']",,2006/11/30 09:00,2007/03/14 09:00,['2006/11/30 09:00'],"['2006/11/30 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/03/14 09:00 [medline]', '2006/11/30 09:00 [entrez]']","['jem.20060967 [pii]', '10.1084/jem.20060967 [doi]']",ppublish,J Exp Med. 2006 Dec 25;203(13):2829-40. doi: 10.1084/jem.20060967.

We performed a linkage between two New Jersey databases: the Adult Blood Lead Epidemiology and Surveillance System (ABLES) and the New Jersey State Cancer Registry (NJSCR) for 1985-2001 to ascertain the risk of cancer in lead-exposed workers and to evaluate the usefulness of this type of linkage. METHODS: A cohort of 3192 men from the ABLES database met the selection criteria before the linkage. AUTOMATCH was used to link the two databases. Person-time was stratified for each worker by five-year age group and calendar year. A standardized incidence ratios (SIR) analysis was performed. RESULTS: 83 cases of cancer were found among 3165 men after all exclusions were made. Workers were followed for an average of ten years and contributed 30,401 person-years. The SIR analysis showed a large overall deficit of cancer (SIR=0.51; 95% CI 0.41 to 0.62). Cancers of the stomach, breast, larynx, intrahepatic bile duct, and chronic myeloid leukemia were non-significantly elevated. Prostate cancer showed the only statistically significant result, a deficit with an SIR of 0.35 (95% CI 0.20 to 0.57). Deficits also occurred in cancers of the lung, kidney, and brain. CONCLUSIONS: The results do not indicate that occupational exposure to lead is associated with cancer. However, firm conclusions are not possible because of various study limitations, including small numbers, a large percentage of workers without age information, short follow-up time, and lack of vital status information. Cancer incidence in this cohort was expected to be low due to the Healthy Worker Effect and young age. Further follow-up of this cohort may be warranted since additional cancers may accrue as time from first exposure increases. Increased worker cohort information would also improve this type of study.","['Lam, Thuy V', 'Agovino, Pamela', 'Niu, Xiaoling', 'Roche, Lisa']","['Lam TV', 'Agovino P', 'Niu X', 'Roche L']","['Cancer Epidemiology Services, New Jersey Department of Health and Senior Services, Trenton, New Jersey, United States. thuy.lam@doh.state.nj.us']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",20061128,Netherlands,Sci Total Environ,The Science of the total environment,0330500,['2P299V784P (Lead)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Data Collection/methods', 'Humans', 'Industry', 'Lead/*blood/*toxicity', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms/*chemically induced/epidemiology', 'New Jersey/epidemiology', 'Occupational Diseases/chemically induced/epidemiology', '*Occupational Exposure', 'Risk Assessment', 'SEER Program']",,2006/11/30 09:00,2007/03/16 09:00,['2006/11/30 09:00'],"['2006/04/07 00:00 [received]', '2006/10/02 00:00 [revised]', '2006/10/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2006/11/30 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/03/16 09:00 [medline]', '2006/11/30 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0048-9697(06)00815-1 [pii]', '10.1016/j.scitotenv.2006.10.018 [doi]']",ppublish,Sci Total Environ. 2007 Jan 1;372(2-3):455-62. doi: 10.1016/j.scitotenv.2006.10.018.

The five lignans could effectively reverse drug resistance of the two cell lines to vincristine, daunorubicin, and VP-16. This study, together with our previous reports, proves that dibenzocyclooctadiene lignans have multiple activities against cancer multidrug resistance, including inhibition of P-gp and MRP1, and enhancement of apoptosis.

In this study, we report that 3-HK induces G1 cell-cycle arrest, differentiation and apoptosis in APL NB4 cell line. Indeed, the drug between 24 to 96 h induced 7-65% growth inhibition of NB4 cells. Cell viability was also decreased by 2-55% between 24 to 96 h treatments with the drug, respectively. These effects of the drug were also dose-dependent. According to flow cytomtry results, 3-HK (15 nM) induced a significant G1-arrest up to 24 h which was consequently followed with appearance of sub-G(1) peak at 72 to 96 h. Hoechst 33258 staining and DNA fragmentation assays confirmed the occurrence of apoptosis among the treated cells. On the other hand, NBT reducing assay, Wright-Giemsa staining, phagocytic activity and expression of cell surface markers (CD11b and CD14) confirmed that the inhibition of proliferation is associated with differentiation especially toward macrophage-like morphology. Interestingly, 3-HK at 5 and 10 nM enhanced the effects of all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) in NB4 cells.

Infections have been cited in most cases involving splenic rupture but are rare in hematological malignancies despite frequent involvement of the spleen. METHODS AND MATERIALS: We present a case of a splenic rupture caused by infiltration of B-cell lymphoma. A 43 year old gentleman presented with a 1 day h/o left upper quadrant pain; nausea and vomiting for 2 days with associated dizziness and anorexia. The CT showed abnormal spleen 20 x 11 cm with free fluid in the abdomen and enlarged retroperitoneal LNs. The patient underwent a splenectomy after initial resuscitation and the operative finding was that of a massively enlarged spleen with areas of tumor extruding through the splenic capsule. RESULT AND CONCLUSION: Although the spleen is often involved in hematological malignancies, splenic rupture is an infrequent occurrence. In a recent literature review 136 cases were of splenic rupture secondary to hematological malignancy were identified. Acute leukemia and non Hodgkin lymphoma were the frequent causes followed by chronic myelogenous leukemia. Male sex, adulthood, severe splenomegaly and cytoreductive chemotherapy were factors more often associated with splenic rupture. Emergency splenectomy remains the cornerstone treatment for splenic rupture. We present a case report of a ""spontaneous splenic rupture"" and discuss the presentation, etiology and treatment options along with discussion of relevant literature.","['Biswas, Saptarshi', 'Keddington, Judith', 'McClanathan, James']","['Biswas S', 'Keddington J', 'McClanathan J']","['Department of General Surgery, Stanford University Medical Center, 300 Pasteur Drive, Palo Alto, CA 94305, USA. saptarshibiswas@comcast.net']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20061128,England,World J Emerg Surg,World journal of emergency surgery : WJES,101266603,,,,,2006/11/30 09:00,2006/11/30 09:01,['2006/11/30 09:00'],"['2006/08/18 00:00 [received]', '2006/11/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2006/11/30 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/11/30 09:01 [medline]', '2006/11/30 09:00 [entrez]']","['1749-7922-1-35 [pii]', '10.1186/1749-7922-1-35 [doi]']",epublish,World J Emerg Surg. 2006 Nov 28;1:35. doi: 10.1186/1749-7922-1-35.,,,,,PMC1712221,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Besides chemotaxis, a variety of other functional responses are dependent on calcium ion mobilization. PMNL from chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) patients that were morphologically indistinguishable from normal PMNL were found to be defective in various functions stimulated by a chemoattractant - fMLP. To study the mechanism underlying defective functions in CML PMNL, we studied calcium mobilization in CML PMNL in response to two different classical chemoattractants, fMLP and C5a. RESULTS: Release of calcium estimated by flow cytometry and spectrofluorimetry using fluo-3 as an indicator showed that the [Ca2+]i levels were lower in CML PMNL as compared to those in normal PMNL. But, both normal and CML PMNL showed maximum [Ca2+]i in response to fMLP and C5a at 10 sec and 30 sec, respectively. Spectrofluorimetric analysis of the total calcium release in chemoattractant treated PMNL indicated more and faster efflux of [Ca2+]i in CML PMNL as compared to normal PMNL. CONCLUSION: Fine-tuning of Ca2+ homeostasis was altered in CML PMNL. The altered Ca2+ homeostasis may contribute to the defective functions of CML PMNL.","['Revankar, Chetana M', 'Advani, Suresh H', 'Naik, Nishigandha R']","['Revankar CM', 'Advani SH', 'Naik NR']","['Biochemistry and Cell Biology, Cancer Research Institute, ACTREC, TMC, Navi Mumbai 410210, India. cmr43@georgetown.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20061127,England,Mol Cancer,Molecular cancer,101147698,"['0 (Chemotactic Factors)', '59880-97-6 (N-Formylmethionine Leucyl-Phenylalanine)', '80295-54-1 (Complement C5a)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Calcium/*metabolism', 'Calcium Signaling/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chemotactic Factors/pharmacology', 'Complement C5a/pharmacology', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Homeostasis/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/blood/*metabolism/pathology', 'Models, Biological', 'N-Formylmethionine Leucyl-Phenylalanine/pharmacology', 'Neutrophils/drug effects/*metabolism']",,2006/11/30 09:00,2007/01/11 09:00,['2006/11/30 09:00'],"['2006/10/13 00:00 [received]', '2006/11/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2006/11/30 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/01/11 09:00 [medline]', '2006/11/30 09:00 [entrez]']","['1476-4598-5-65 [pii]', '10.1186/1476-4598-5-65 [doi]']",epublish,Mol Cancer. 2006 Nov 27;5:65. doi: 10.1186/1476-4598-5-65.,,,,,PMC1687200,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Treatment of NB4 cells with growth-suppressive concentrations of ZER resulted in G2/M cell cycle arrest that was associated with a decline of Cyclin B1 protein, but with the phosphorylation of ATM/ Chk1/Chk2. In addition, ZER induced the phosphorylation of Cdc25C at the Thr48 residue and Cdc2 at the Thr14/Tyr15 residues. Furthermore, ZER-induced apoptosis in NB4 cells was initiated by the expression of Fas (CD95)/Fas Ligand (CD95L), concomitant with the activation of caspase-8. ZER was also found to induce the cleavage of Bid, a mediator that is known to connect the Fas/CD95 cell death receptor to the mitochondrial apoptosis pathway. ZER also induced the cleavage of Bax and Mcl-1 proteins, but not Bcl-2 or Bcl-XL. ZER-induced apoptosis took place in association with a loss of the mitochondrial transmembrane potential as well as the activation of caspase-3 and -9, resulting in the degradation of the proteolytic poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP). ZER also triggered a release of cytochrome c into the cytoplasm. Both antagonistic anti-Fas antibody ZB4 and pan-caspase inhibitor Z-VAD inhibited ZER-induced apoptosis in NB4 cells. Taken together, ZER is an inducer of apoptosis in leukemic cells that specifically triggers the Fas/CD95- and mitochondria-mediated apoptotic signaling pathway.","['Xian, Mingji', 'Ito, Keisuke', 'Nakazato, Tomonori', 'Shimizu, Takatsune', 'Chen, Chien-Kang', 'Yamato, Kenji', 'Murakami, Akira', 'Ohigashi, Hajime', 'Ikeda, Yasuo', 'Kizaki, Masahiro']","['Xian M', 'Ito K', 'Nakazato T', 'Shimizu T', 'Chen CK', 'Yamato K', 'Murakami A', 'Ohigashi H', 'Ikeda Y', 'Kizaki M']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Division of Hematology, Keio University School of Medicine, 35 Shinanomachi, Shinjuku-ku Tokyo, 160-8582 Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Cancer Sci,Cancer science,101168776,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Fas Ligand Protein)', '0 (Sesquiterpenes)', '0 (fas Receptor)', '471-05-6 (zerumbone)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Blotting, Western', 'Caspase 3/drug effects/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Fas Ligand Protein/drug effects/metabolism', 'G2 Phase/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy', 'Mitochondria/*drug effects', 'Sesquiterpenes/*pharmacology', 'fas Receptor/*drug effects/metabolism']",,2006/11/30 09:00,2007/05/05 09:00,['2006/11/30 09:00'],"['2006/11/30 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/05/05 09:00 [medline]', '2006/11/30 09:00 [entrez]']","['CAS362 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1349-7006.2006.00362.x [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Sci. 2007 Jan;98(1):118-26. doi: 10.1111/j.1349-7006.2006.00362.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We describe the clinicopathological, immunophenotypic and cytogenetic findings in seven patients with B-cell neoplasms associated with t(14;19)(q32;q13). There were five men and two women, with a median age of 48 years (range 33-68). All had absolute lymphocytosis, six had lymphadenopathy, and one had splenomegaly. Lymphocytes in blood and bone marrow aspirate smears were predominantly small and cytologically atypical. Flow cytometric immunophenotyping showed an atypical immunophenotype with low CLL scores. The growth pattern in bone marrow biopsy specimens was interstitial to diffuse; immunohistochemical stains were positive for bcl3 and negative for cyclin D1. Lymph node biopsy specimens of two patients revealed total architectural effacement by neoplasm with proliferation centres. In addition to t(14;19), cytogenetic studies demonstrated trisomy 12 in five patients. These results suggest that B-cell neoplasms with the t(14;19)(q32;q13) present frequently as leukaemia composed of small B-lymphocytes and share many features with CLL.

Ultimately, all patients relapse despite achieving an initial response, as minimal residual disease (MRD) persisting after therapy eventually evolves into morphological and clinical recurrence. The emergence of immune-based combination therapies capable of inducing molecular remissions, the availability of highly sensitive assays that detect MRD, and emerging data showing a longer duration of response or longer survival in patients with no detectable disease, suggest that eradicating MRD may be a reasonable option for some patients. Moreover, novel biological prognostic markers have divided CLL into favourable and unfavourable subtypes, arguing in favour of defining different goals of therapy for different patients. Clinicians are increasingly challenged with the task of how best to incorporate MRD assessment into clinical practice, especially in an era when these novel prognostic factors exist. This review summarises the current understanding of MRD from a clinical standpoint, suggests that MRD eradication maybe a reasonable option for some patients, and argues in favour of designing large randomised studies to determine whether MRD-negative remission improves outcome.","['Nabhan, Chadi', 'Coutre, Steven', 'Hillmen, Peter']","['Nabhan C', 'Coutre S', 'Hillmen P']","['Division of Hematology and Oncology, Lutheran General Hospital Cancer Center, Park Ridge, IL, USA. cnabhan@oncmed.net']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20061127,England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,,IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy/methods', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/mortality/*therapy', 'Neoplasm, Residual/mortality/*therapy', '*Patient Selection', 'Prognosis', 'Remission Induction', 'Stem Cell Transplantation']",73,2006/11/30 09:00,2007/03/30 09:00,['2006/11/30 09:00'],"['2006/11/30 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/03/30 09:00 [medline]', '2006/11/30 09:00 [entrez]']","['BJH6428 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1365-2141.2006.06428.x [doi]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2007 Feb;136(3):379-92. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.2006.06428.x.

However, the prognostic assessments have mainly been derived from patients with AML aged <60 years. Two recent studies of AML patients of 60 years and older proposed prognostic classifications with distinct discrepancies. To further study the prognostic value of cytogenetic abnormalities in this patient population, we have evaluated cytogenetic abnormalities in a series of 293 untreated patients with AML aged 60 years and older, included in a randomised phase 3 trial, also in relation to patient characteristics and clinical outcome. The most frequently observed cytogenetic abnormality was trisomy 8 (+8), in 31 (11%) patients. Abnormalities, such as -5, 5q-, abn(17p) and abn(17q), were almost exclusively present in complex karyotypes.

METHOD: Twenty-seven patients with a diagnosis of CMPD were included in the study. Patients were excluded if they had a secondary cause of PH. Diagnosis of PH was established if right ventricular systolic pressure (RVSP) by transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) was >35 mmHg. RESULTS: Diagnosis of PH was established in 14 out of 27 patients. Two patients were excluded from analysis because of poor ejection fraction on TTE, resulting in a final diagnosis of PH in 12 of 25 (48%) patients. Of these 25 patients, seven of nine with essential thrombocytosis (ET), five of 14 with polycythemia vera (PV), and 0 out of two with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) had PH. All patients were asymptomatic at the time of their most recent visit. There was no relationship between PH and age at diagnosis, duration of disease, platelet count and hematocrit at diagnosis or during follow-up, both for the entire cohort or for specific diagnosis of ET or PV. CONCLUSION: Pulmonary hypertension appears to be common in patients with CMPD.

(2) In France, three haematopoietic growth factors are licensed to stimulate leukocyte production: filgrastim (unglycosylated granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF)), pegfilgrastim (pegylated filgrastim), and lenograstim (glycosylated G-CSF). (3) The main adverse effects of these three growth factors are joint and bone pain, a flu-like syndrome, and reactions at the injection site. (4) G-CSF has provided disappointing results in primary prevention, and its use is only justified for patients receiving chemotherapy that causes febrile neutropenia in at least 40% of cases: patients with acute leukaemia, elderly patients, and patients with cancer-related neutropenia or poor general status, etc. In these patients, G-CSF reduces the incidence of febrile neutropenia and, possibly, the risk of hospitalisation. A meta-analysis of 11 comparative trials involving about 1500 patients with non Hodgkin's lymphoma showed only a reduction in the incidence of febrile neutropenia and infections. (5) In the prevention of recurrences of neutropenia on continuing chemotherapy, only one trial, involving patients aged over 60 with high-grade non Hodgkin's lymphoma, showed an improvement in survival time with filgrastim (survival rate: 64.3% with filgrastim versus 49% with placebo, after a median follow-up of 40 months). Until these results are confirmed in other clinical trials, reduction in the intensity of chemotherapy (dosage, frequency) is generally recommended. (6) Curative treatment of neutropenia with G-CSF is only warranted for febrile patients with a high risk of severe infections requiring lengthy hospitalisation.

Flt3-activating mutations have been associated with poor prognosis and decreased overall survival of AML patients, thus Flt3 constitutes an ideal target for drug treatment of such disease. Unfortunately, the monotherapy with small-molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors in clinical trials shows that remission is not permanent, presumably by resistance of Flt3 mutants to inhibitors. An alternative approach for treatment is based on the cooperation between Flt3 and additional intracellular pathways for AML transformation in some patients. Thus, the inhibition of both Flt3 and such pathways may be exploited for successful treatment of the disease. We investigated the importance of Flt3-activating mutations for the constitutive activation of intracellular pathways in primary AML cells, and their effect on cell survival. We found that the main compounds involved in the differentiation, proliferation and survival of AML (MAPK/AKT/STAT) were constitutively activated. However, only four samples showed internal tandem duplications (ITDs) for Flt3. Surprisingly, contrary to previous reports, we found that inhibition of ITD/Flt3 activity did not prevent the phosphorylation of ERK, STAT5 or Akt in some primary AML cells. In parallel, we found that in these cells, Flt3 and ERK or Akt cooperate to regulate cell survival. Our results support the hypothesis that the optimal therapeutic treatment of AML may require not only the oncogenic tyrosine kinase, but also the appropriate combination of different specific inhibitors, thus providing a more effective approach to reverse leukaemogenesis. Thus, we propose that each AML patient should have an individually tailored combination treatment.","['Siendones, Emilio', 'Barbarroja, Nuria', 'Torres, Luis Aristides', 'Buendia, Paula', 'Velasco, Francisco', 'Dorado, Gabriel', 'Torres, Antonio', 'Lopez-Pedrera, Chary']","['Siendones E', 'Barbarroja N', 'Torres LA', 'Buendia P', 'Velasco F', 'Dorado G', 'Torres A', 'Lopez-Pedrera C']","['Unidad de Investigacion, Hospital Universitario Reina Sofia, Cordoba, Spain. esiecas@upo.es']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Hematol Oncol,Hematological oncology,8307268,"['0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (STAT Transcription Factors)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Cell Survival', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/pathology', '*Mutation', 'Phosphorylation', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/metabolism', 'STAT Transcription Factors/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/*drug effects', 'Tandem Repeat Sequences', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/*antagonists & inhibitors/*genetics']",,2006/11/28 09:00,2007/05/16 09:00,['2006/11/28 09:00'],"['2006/11/28 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/05/16 09:00 [medline]', '2006/11/28 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/hon.805 [doi]'],ppublish,Hematol Oncol. 2007 Mar;25(1):30-7. doi: 10.1002/hon.805.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These data support the implication of SERCA pumps and especially SERCA3 in the differentiation program of cancer and leukemia cells.

BLV can also be transmitted experimentally to a related ruminant species, sheep, in which the pathogenesis is more acute. Although both susceptible species develop a strong anti-viral immune response, the virus persists indefinitely throughout life, apparently at a transcriptionally silent stage, at least in a proportion of infected cells. Soon after infection, these humoral and cytotoxic activities very efficiently abolish the viral replicative cycle, permitting only mitotic expansion of provirus-carrying cells. Short term cultures of these infected cells initially indicated that viral expression protects against spontaneous apoptosis, suggesting that leukemia is a process of accumulation of long-lived cells. This conclusion was recently reconsidered following in vivo dynamic studies based on perfusions of nucleoside (bromodeoxyuridine) or fluorescent protein markers (CFSE). In sheep, the turnover rate of infected cells is increased, suggesting that a permanent clearance process is exerted by the immune system. Lymphocyte trafficking from and to the secondary lymphoid organs is a key component in the maintenance of cell homeostasis. The net outcome of the immune selective pressure is that only cells in which the virus is transcriptionally silenced survive and accumulate, ultimately leading to lymphocytosis. Activation of viral and/or cellular expression in this silent reservoir with deacetylase inhibitors causes the collapse of the proviral loads. In other words, modulation of viral expression appears to be curative in lymphocytic sheep, an approach that might also be efficient in patients infected with the related Human T-lymphotropic virus type 1. In summary, a dynamic interplay between BLV and the host immune response modulates a complex equilibrium between (i) viral expression driving (or) favoring proliferation and (ii) viral silencing preventing apoptosis. As conclusion, we propose a hypothetical model unifying all these mechanisms.","['Florins, Arnaud', 'Gillet, Nicolas', 'Asquith, Becca', 'Boxus, Mathieu', 'Burteau, Catherine', 'Twizere, Jean-Claude', 'Urbain, Patrice', 'Vandermeers, Fabian', 'Debacq, Christophe', 'Sanchez-Alcaraz, Maria Teresa', 'Schwartz-Cornil, Isabelle', 'Kerkhofs, Pierre', 'Jean, Genevieve', 'Thewis, Andre', 'Hay, Jack', 'Mortreux, Franck', 'Wattel, Eric', 'Reichert, Michal', 'Burny, Arsene', 'Kettmann, Richard', 'Bangham, Charles', 'Willems, Luc']","['Florins A', 'Gillet N', 'Asquith B', 'Boxus M', 'Burteau C', 'Twizere JC', 'Urbain P', 'Vandermeers F', 'Debacq C', 'Sanchez-Alcaraz MT', 'Schwartz-Cornil I', 'Kerkhofs P', 'Jean G', 'Thewis A', 'Hay J', 'Mortreux F', 'Wattel E', 'Reichert M', 'Burny A', 'Kettmann R', 'Bangham C', 'Willems L']","['Molecular and Cellular biology, FNRS-FUSAG, Gembloux, Belgium.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20070101,United States,Front Biosci,Frontiers in bioscience : a journal and virtual library,9709506,,IM,"['Animals', 'Antibody Formation', 'Apoptosis', 'Cattle', 'Enzootic Bovine Leukosis/drug therapy/*immunology/*virology', 'Leukemia Virus, Bovine/genetics/*pathogenicity/physiology', '*Models, Immunological', 'Sheep', 'Sheep Diseases/virology', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/immunology', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Virus Replication']",90,2006/11/28 09:00,2007/08/24 09:00,['2006/11/28 09:00'],"['2006/11/28 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/08/24 09:00 [medline]', '2006/11/28 09:00 [entrez]']","['2165 [pii]', '10.2741/2165 [doi]']",epublish,Front Biosci. 2007 Jan 1;12:1520-31. doi: 10.2741/2165.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The effects that Tax exerts on cells include potent NF-k B activation, cell cycle perturbation and cell transformation. How Tax influences ATL development is incompletely understood at present. While Tax-expression is needed at the early stages of cellular transformation, at later times most ATL cells do not express tax; therefore, genetic and epigenetic changes in HTLV-1-infected cells are believed to play an important role in the etiology of ATL.

Very recently, it has become clear that therapeutic application of G-CSF may not be limited to different types of neutropenia, but may extend to non-hematological conditions, in particular cardiac and brain infarctions. G-CSF drives the proliferation, survival and neutrophilic differentiation of myeloid progenitor cells by activation of a receptor of the hematopoietin receptor superfamily, which subsequently triggers multiple signaling mechanisms. These mechanisms exert positive as well as negative effects on the signaling function of the G-CSF receptor. The integrated output of these signaling pathways provide the appropriate balance needed for accurate production of neutrophils under both steady state and ""emergency"" conditions.

Some components of these pathways are mutated or aberrantly expressed in human cancer (e.g., Ras, B-Raf). Mutations also occur at genes encoding upstream receptors (e.g., EGFR and Flt-3) and chimeric chromosomal translocations (e.g., BCR-ABL) which transmit their signals through these cascades. Even in the absence of obvious genetic mutations, this pathway has been reported to be activated in over 50% of acute myelogenous leukemia and acute lymphocytic leukemia and is also frequently activated in other cancer types (e.g., breast and prostate cancers). Importantly, this increased expression is associated with a poor prognosis. The Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK and Ras/PI3K/PTEN/Akt pathways interact with each other to regulate growth and in some cases tumorigenesis. For example, in some cells, PTEN mutation may contribute to suppression of the Raf/MEK/ERK cascade due to the ability of activated Akt to phosphorylate and inactivate different Rafs. Although both of these pathways are commonly thought to have anti-apoptotic and drug resistance effects on cells, they display different cell lineage specific effects. For example, Raf/MEK/ERK is usually associated with proliferation and drug resistance of hematopoietic cells, while activation of the Raf/MEK/ERK cascade is suppressed in some prostate cancer cell lines which have mutations at PTEN and express high levels of activated Akt. Furthermore the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK and Ras/PI3K/PTEN/Akt pathways also interact with the p53 pathway. Some of these interactions can result in controlling the activity and subcellular localization of Bim, Bak, Bax, Puma and Noxa. Raf/MEK/ERK may promote cell cycle arrest in prostate cells and this may be regulated by p53 as restoration of wild-type p53 in p53 deficient prostate cancer cells results in their enhanced sensitivity to chemotherapeutic drugs and increased expression of Raf/MEK/ERK pathway. Thus in advanced prostate cancer, it may be advantageous to induce Raf/MEK/ERK expression to promote cell cycle arrest, while in hematopoietic cancers it may be beneficial to inhibit Raf/MEK/ERK induced proliferation and drug resistance. Thus the Raf/MEK/ERK pathway has different effects on growth, prevention of apoptosis, cell cycle arrest and induction of drug resistance in cells of various lineages which may be due to the presence of functional p53 and PTEN and the expression of lineage specific factors.","['McCubrey, James A', 'Steelman, Linda S', 'Chappell, William H', 'Abrams, Stephen L', 'Wong, Ellis W T', 'Chang, Fumin', 'Lehmann, Brian', 'Terrian, David M', 'Milella, Michele', 'Tafuri, Agostino', 'Stivala, Franca', 'Libra, Massimo', 'Basecke, Jorg', 'Evangelisti, Camilla', 'Martelli, Alberto M', 'Franklin, Richard A']","['McCubrey JA', 'Steelman LS', 'Chappell WH', 'Abrams SL', 'Wong EW', 'Chang F', 'Lehmann B', 'Terrian DM', 'Milella M', 'Tafuri A', 'Stivala F', 'Libra M', 'Basecke J', 'Evangelisti C', 'Martelli AM', 'Franklin RA']","['Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Leo Jenkins Cancer Center, Brody School of Medicine at East Carolina University, Greenville, NC 27858, USA. mccubreyj@ecu.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20061007,Netherlands,Biochim Biophys Acta,Biochimica et biophysica acta,0217513,"['EC 2.7.11.1 (raf Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.12.2 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis', 'Cell Cycle', '*Cell Proliferation', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/*metabolism', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*physiology', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases/metabolism', 'Female', 'Humans', 'MAP Kinase Signaling System/*physiology', 'Male', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinases/metabolism', 'Models, Biological', 'Neoplasms/drug therapy/enzymology', 'Oxidative Stress', 'raf Kinases/metabolism']",196,2006/11/28 09:00,2007/09/27 09:00,['2006/11/28 09:00'],"['2006/09/05 00:00 [received]', '2006/10/02 00:00 [revised]', '2006/10/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2006/11/28 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/09/27 09:00 [medline]', '2006/11/28 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0167-4889(06)00315-6 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bbamcr.2006.10.001 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochim Biophys Acta. 2007 Aug;1773(8):1263-84. doi: 10.1016/j.bbamcr.2006.10.001.

METHODS: Animals were assigned to sham operation and three experimental groups. The experimental groups were placed on bypass, cooled to 18 degrees C, and subjected to 90 minutes of deep hypothermic circulatory arrest (DHCA), low-flow cardiopulmonary bypass (LFCPB) at mL/(kg x min), or selective cerebral perfusion (SCP) at 20 mL/(kg x min), followed by rewarming and 2 hours of recovery. The oxygen pressure in the microcirculation of the cortex was measured by quenching of phosphorescence. Levels of phosphorylated and total protein were determined by Western blot analysis. RESULTS: Control oxygen pressure was 55 +/- 9 mm Hg and decreased during DHCA, LFCPB, and SCP to 1.1 +/- 0.6 mm Hg, 9.8 +/- 2.3 mm Hg, and 9.3 +/- 1.9 mm Hg, respectively (p < 0.001).

However, development of left ventricular (systemic ventricle) dysfunction late after repair remains a concern. In this study we sought to determine factors leading to late impairment in left ventricular performance. METHODS: From August 1992 to July 2005, 44 patients (median age at surgery, 1.6 years; range, 0.6 to 39.6 years) with congenitally corrected transposition of the great arteries had anatomic repair. Left ventricular function and mitral regurgitation were evaluated by echocardiography at follow-up. Twenty-three patients had a Rastelli procedure, and 21 underwent an arterial switch. Twelve patients (27%) were pacemaker dependent at latest follow-up. RESULTS: Early mortality was 4.5% (n = 2) with 1 late death as a result of leukemia. Median follow-up was 3.0 years (range, 7 days to 12.4 years). Left ventricular function remained unchanged (normal) in 35 patients, improved in 1 patient, and deteriorated in 8 patients (18%). Mitral regurgitation was unchanged in 30 patients, improved in 6 patients, and worsened in 8 patients (18%). Development of left ventricular dysfunction was significantly associated with pacemaker implantation (p = 0.005) and a widened QRS (>20% > 98% percentile of normal; p = 0.03).

An initial model for its pathogenetic effects emphasized the conversion of a hematopoietic transcriptional activator, RUNX1 (or AML1), into a leukemogenic repressor which blocked myeloid differentiation at the level of target gene regulation. This view has been absorbed into a larger picture of AML1-ETO pathogenesis, encompassing dysregulation of hematopoietic stem cell homeostasis at several mechanistic levels. Recent reports have highlighted a multifaceted capacity of AML1-ETO directly to inhibit key hematopoietic transcription factors that function as tumor suppressors at several nodal points during hematopoietic differentiation. A new model is presented in which AML1-ETO coordinates expansion of the stem cell compartment with diminished lineage commitment and with genome instability.","['Elagib, Kamaleldin E', 'Goldfarb, Adam N']","['Elagib KE', 'Goldfarb AN']","['Department of Pathology, University of Virginia School of Medicine, P.O.

We identified such cooperative effects in six cell lines arising from different major types of malignancies, i.e., breast, lung, prostate and pancreas carcinomas as well as leukemia. The chemotherapeutic drugs tested were adriamycin, taxol, BCNU and cisplatin. For instance, MJ exhibited strong cooperative effects with BCNU in MIA PaCa-2 pancreatic carcinoma cells. Furthermore, MJ enhanced significantly (pV=0.028) the anti-leukemic effect of adriamycin in vivo, in a CLL mouse model. Finally, MJ cooperated with the glycolysis inhibitor 2-deoxy-D-glucose in inducing death of several types of carcinoma cells. We conclude that administration of MJ with common chemotherapeutic drugs and glycolysis inhibitors bears a promise for effective anti-cancer therapy.","['Heyfets, Alina', 'Flescher, Eliezer']","['Heyfets A', 'Flescher E']","['Department of Human Microbiology, Sackler Faculty of Medicine, Tel-Aviv University, Tel Aviv 69978, Israel.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20061127,Ireland,Cancer Lett,Cancer letters,7600053,"['0 (Acetates)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Cyclopentanes)', '0 (Oxylipins)', '900N171A0F (methyl jasmonate)', '9G2MP84A8W (Deoxyglucose)']",IM,"['Acetates/*pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cyclopentanes/*pharmacology', 'Deoxyglucose/*pharmacology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Synergism', 'Mice', 'Oxylipins']",,2006/11/28 09:00,2007/06/26 09:00,['2006/11/28 09:00'],"['2006/07/30 00:00 [received]', '2006/10/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2006/11/28 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/06/26 09:00 [medline]', '2006/11/28 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0304-3835(06)00572-6 [pii]', '10.1016/j.canlet.2006.10.013 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Lett. 2007 Jun 8;250(2):300-10. doi: 10.1016/j.canlet.2006.10.013.

Apoptosis rate is elevated in ""early phase"" MDS, whereas it diminishes during disease progression to acute leukemia, consensually to the acquisition of independent growth features. Survivin is a member of the inhibitor of the apoptosis (IAP) family, with the bifunctional role of suppressing apoptosis while facilitating cell cycle progression. We investigated Survivin mRNA levels by real-time quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR analysis and Survivin protein expression by immunohistochemistry in 49 bone marrow (BM) aspirates and in 17 BM biopsies (BMB) from MDS patients. Survivin mRNA levels were higher in MDS than in control group (1.68 +/- 1.46 vs 0.25 +/- 0.22; p < 0.0001). MDS patients with low or INT1 International Scoring System for Evaluating Prognosis (IPSS) displayed higher levels of Survivin mRNA in comparison to INT2 or high IPSS (1.91 +/- 1.51 vs 0.88 +/- 0.95; p = 0.0058). Survivin protein immunoreactivity was evaluated as Survivin index S ((i)) and calculated according to the formula: S ((i)) = % of Survivin positive cells x BMB cellularity / 100. Survivin index was higher in the MDS group than in normal BM (p = 0.05). Moreover, in eight cases in which BM aspirates and trephine biopsy were available, we found a significant association between the level of Survivin mRNA and protein expression (p = 0.011). In conclusion, this study demonstrates increased levels of Survivin in MDS compared to normal controls. Moreover, higher levels of transcripts are related to ""low-risk"" MDS.

Before being incorporated into daily practice, however, these markers require standardization and validation in large, prospective trials. Meanwhile, treatment of patients with CLL not included in clinical studies should be decided on the basis of classical NCI/CLL Working Group criteria. An important area of research in CLL prognostication is the identification of markers useful for predicting response to therapy and its duration. Among them, del(17p), reflecting P53 abnormalities, is particularly important. Also relevant is del(11q), which points to ATM defects. There is also some correlation between IgVH mutational status, ZAP-70 and CD38 expression and response to therapy and its duration, although these relationships need further investigation.

In addition, differences in birth rates, activation state, and inducibility appear to exist among subpopulations of cells within individual leukemic clones. The extent to which such dissimilarities influence clinical course and outcome is still unclear. This review examines the evidence supporting the existence of a proliferative compartment in B-CLL and the role that proliferating cells might play in the progression and evolution of this disease.","['Chiorazzi, Nicholas', 'Ferrarini, Manlio']","['Chiorazzi N', 'Ferrarini M']","['The Feinstein Institute for Medical Research, 350 Community Dr., Manhasset, NY 11030, USA. nchizzi@nshs.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",,United States,Hematology Am Soc Hematol Educ Program,Hematology.

Current information on disease-specific prognostic relevance of JAK2V617F is inconclusive and confounded by inter-study differences in the performance of mutation screening assays.

It is mutated in about 1/3 of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients, either by internal tandem duplications (ITD) of the juxtamembrane domain or by point mutations usually involving the kinase domain (KD). Both types of mutation constitutively activate FLT3. Many studies have shown that AML patients with FLT3/ITD mutations have poor cure rates due to relapse. This has led to the development of a number of small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) with activity against FLT3. Many of these are still in preclinical development, but several have entered clinical phase I and II trials as monotherapy in patients with relapsed AML. Patients with FLT3 mutations in these trials have shown clinical responses, most often a clearing of peripheral blasts, but rarely major reductions of bone marrow blasts. Several studies have shown that FLT3 was successfully inhibited in most patients. However, complete remissions have rarely been achieved in these trials. The difference in responses of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) patients to BCR-ABL inhibitors compared to FLT3 mutant AML patients to FLT3 inhibitors may be reflective of treating a single gene disease in CML versus multiply altered gene disease in AML. This has led to clinical testing of FLT3 TKI in combination with conventional chemotherapy, with trial designs based on preclinical testing showing synergistic effects between these agents in inducing cytotoxic responses. Several combination trials are ongoing or planned in both relapsed and newly diagnosed FLT3-mutant AML patients.","['Small, Donald']",['Small D'],"['Johns Hopkins Hospital, 1650 Orleans Street, Baltimore MD 21231, USA. donsmall@jhmi.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",,United States,Hematology Am Soc Hematol Educ Program,Hematology.

Further, APL accounts for 20% to 25% of cases of AML in these countries, consistent with the previous observation of increased incidence of APL in Latin Americans. The lack of population-based registries in developing countries has made it difficult to determine the real incidence of APL. Moreover, APL appears to have other unique epidemiologic characteristics, including association of primary APL with an increased body mass index at diagnosis and association of secondary APL with breast cancer. To facilitate the development of local capacity and implement effective treatment of APL in developing countries, the International Committee of the American Society of Hematology has assembled a working group to formulate treatment guidelines based on evidence from clinical trials results in the developed world but adapted to local resources. It is hoped that uniform treatment, careful documentation of specific outcome data, and ongoing monitoring of treatment efficacy and toxicity will improve the cure rate and provide biologic and epidemiologic information about APL in developing countries.

These include the PML/RARalpha fusion and the transcription co-repressor complex recruited at the promoter of target genes by the hybrid protein, the intense and homogeneous expression of the CD33 antigen, absence of multidrug resistance-related phenotype, and a frequently mutated and constitutively activated FLT3 receptor. Such genotypic and phenotypic features are targeted by agents currently in use in front-line therapy or at relapse (i.e., retinoids, arsenic trioxide, anthracyclines and anti-CD33 monoclonal antibodies), and by novel agents that may find a place in future treatments such as histone deacetylase and FLT3 inhibitors. The unique PML/RARalpha aberration serves as a molecular marker for rapid diagnosis and prediction of response to ATRA-and ATO-containing therapies. Methods for prompt and low-cost detection of this genetic abnormality, such as the analysis of PML nuclear staining, are extremely useful in clinical practice and could be adopted in countries with limited resources as a surrogate for rapid genetic diagnosis. Finally, PML/RARalpha monitoring through sensitive RT-PCR can be regarded as an integrating part of the overall treatment strategy in this disease, whereby the treatment type and intensity are modulated in patients at different risk of relapse according to RT-PCR status during follow-up. Because recent clinical studies suggest that most APL patients receiving intensive chemotherapy may be over-treated, longitudinal and stringent RT-PCR monitoring is becoming increasingly important to test the extent to which chemotherapy can be minimized in those presenting with low-risk disease.","['Lo-Coco, Francesco', 'Ammatuna, Emanuele']","['Lo-Coco F', 'Ammatuna E']","['Department of Biopathology, Via Montpellier 1, 00133 Roma, Italy. francesco.lo.coco@uniroma2.it']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,Hematology Am Soc Hematol Educ Program,Hematology.

Given the high antileukemic efficacy observed with ATO in patients relapsing after ATRA-containing regimens, this agent is currently regarded as the best treatment option in this setting. However, until a randomized comparison between the standard therapy and ATO-based regimens in front-line therapy is available, this latter approach should only be recommended for unfit patients for whom chemotherapy is contraindicated. In addition to reviewing current consensus and controversial issues on antileukemic strategies, this review addresses other aspects that can be crucial for the outcome of individual patients. These aspects include supportive care, recognition and treatment of life-threatening complications, evaluation of response, and, finally, management of the disease in special conditions such as older patients, children and pregnant women.","['Sanz, Miguel A']",['Sanz MA'],"['Servicio de Hematologia, Hospital Universitario La Fe, Av.

In most current pediatric protocols, cranial irradiation (12 to 18 Gy) is given to 5% to 25% of patients--those with T-cell ALL, overt CNS disease (CNS3 status) or high-risk cytogenetics. CNS control is a less urgent concern in adults with ALL, in whom systemic relapse remains the major problem. With current approaches, approximately 2% to 10% of patients can be expected to develop CNS relapse. Children with B-cell precursor ALL who have a late CNS relapse (after an initial remission of 18 months or more) and did not receive cranial irradiation have an excellent outcome after retrieval therapy, with a 5-year event-free survival (EFS) rate approaching that in newly diagnosed patients. Innovative treatment options are needed for children who develop CNS relapses after a short initial remission or after receiving cranial irradiation, and in any adults with CNS leukemia at diagnosis or relapse.","['Pui, Ching-Hon']",['Pui CH'],"[""St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, 332 N.

These differences can range from inherited variability in the genes that affect drug absorption, distribution, intracellular transport, metabolism, and elimination, to variability in the genes that encode either the target of the drug or components of the pathway affected by the drug. The main goal of pharmacogenomics is to improve our understanding of how these variations, either individually or collectively, influence the therapeutic response. The genetic differences inherent within cancer cells constitute the other major variable in a patient's ultimate response to therapy. In this review, we provide an overview of high-throughput genomic methods that can be used to identify genetic lesions within cancer cells. These efforts will ultimately allow the identification of the full complement of genetic lesions that underlie the establishment and maintenance of the leukemic clone. The identification of these lesions should provide the bases for defining the molecular ""Achilles heels"" against which new targeted therapies can be developed.","['Downing, James R', 'Mullighan, Charles G']","['Downing JR', 'Mullighan CG']","[""St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, 332 N.

This knowledge has generated hope that the individual basis for response to a wide range of drugs would be quickly known, and individualized drug selection and dosing would be possible for many or all disorders. Understanding the variable response to drugs seems particularly pressing in the field of oncology, in which the stakes are high (failure to cure cancer usually leads to death), drugs commonly have a narrow therapeutic index, and toxicities can be severe (a significant frequency of toxic death is a feature of most acute myeloid leukemia protocols, for example). However, in common with many new technologies, the generalizability and clinical application of pharmacogenetics has proved more challenging than expected. Difficulties include, in many examples, a modest clinical effect relative to genotype, therapy-specific, not broad, applicability and the very major challenge of unraveling the complexity of gene-gene interactions. In addition, ethical and economic challenges to the application of pharmacogenetics have moved to the fore in recent years, particularly in the context of racial differences in outcome of therapy. Genomic, rather than candidate gene approaches to identification of relevant loci are increasingly being explored, and significant progress is being made. However, greater understanding of the complexities of multiple gene modifiers of outcome, and the statistical challenge of understanding such data, will be needed before individualized therapy can be applied on a routine basis.","['Davies, Stella M']",['Davies SM'],"[""Cincinnati Children's Hospital and Medical Center, Cincinnati OH 45229, USA. stella.davies@cchmc.org""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,Hematology Am Soc Hematol Educ Program,Hematology.

It belongs to the genus Deltaretrovirus of the family Retroviridae along with human and simian T-lymphotropic viruses. The BLV transcriptional promoter is located in the proviral 5' long terminal repeat (LTR), composed of U3, R, and U5 regions. BLV LTR contains multiple cis-acting elements important for promoter activity, a short coding sequence (encoding the NH(2) terminus of the G4 regulatory protein), and non-regulatory/non-coding regions. Variation in coding sequences of BLV structural proteins has been studied extensively, but little work has been done on sequence variability of non-coding regions, mostly located in LTR. Here, we report the first study on the natural diversity of the BLV LTR, using viral isolates from 52 cattle in several different areas worldwide. Nucleotide variations from the consensus sequence were observed in most isolates and clustered phylogenetically, corresponding to the geographic distribution of donor cattle. Overall, regulatory regions were significantly more conserved than non-regulatory regions in the BLV LTR, as well as in LTR sub-regions (U3, R, and U5).

Hepatosplenomegaly is observed in ANKL patients, and hepatic failure is a common cause of death. Significant numbers of ANKL cells were pathologically observed in sinusoidal and interlobular regions of the liver, and in the splenic red pulp. In our previous study, ANKL cells were simultaneously positive for CXCR1 and CCR5. So, in order to elucidate the mechanism in the systemic migration of ANKL cells, we investigated the expression of the corresponding chemokines in ANKL compared with CNKL. The serum level of IL-8, MIP-1alpha and MIP-1beta was significantly elevated in ANKL patients, and ANKL cells were highly positive for IL-8, RANTES, MIP-1alpha and MIP-1beta according to intracellular staining and RT-PCR.

The present study used Cox regression procedures to examine further the exposure-response relationship between several unlagged and lagged, continuous, time-dependent BD exposure indices (BD parts per million (ppm)-years, the total number of exposures to BD concentrations >100 ppm (""peaks"") and average intensity of BD) and leukemia, lymphoid neoplasms and myeloid neoplasms. All three BD exposure indices were associated positively with leukemia. Using continuous, untransformed BD ppm-years the regression coefficient (beta) from an analysis that controlled only for age was 2.9 x 10(-4) (p<0.01); the regression coefficient adjusted for all covariates (age, year of birth, race, plant, years since hire and dimethyldithiocarbamate) was similar in magnitude (beta=3.0 x 10(-4), p=0.04). Lagging exposure had minimal impact on the results for leukemia for any of the three BD exposure indices. In models that controlled only for age, lymphoid neoplasms were associated with BD ppm-years and myeloid neoplasms, with BD peaks, but neither trend was statistically significant after adjusting for multiple covariates. The present results support the presence of a causal relationship between high cumulative exposure and high intensity of exposure to BD and leukemia.","['Cheng, Hong', 'Sathiakumar, Nalini', 'Graff, John', 'Matthews, Robert', 'Delzell, Elizabeth']","['Cheng H', 'Sathiakumar N', 'Graff J', 'Matthews R', 'Delzell E']","['University of Alabama at Birmingham, Ryals School of Public Health, Department of Epidemiology, Birmingham, AL, USA. hcheng@ms.soph.uab.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20061013,Ireland,Chem Biol Interact,Chemico-biological interactions,0227276,"['0 (Butadienes)', '0 (Carcinogens)', '0 (Dimethyldithiocarbamate)', '9006-04-6 (Rubber)', 'JSD5FGP5VD (1,3-butadiene)']",IM,"['Butadienes/*adverse effects', 'Canada/epidemiology', 'Carcinogens/chemical synthesis/chemistry/toxicity', '*Chemical Industry/statistics & numerical data', 'Confidence Intervals', 'Dimethyldithiocarbamate/adverse effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*chemically induced/epidemiology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*chemically induced/epidemiology', 'Likelihood Functions', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Occupational Exposure/*statistics & numerical data', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'Rubber/adverse effects/*chemical synthesis/chemistry', 'United States/epidemiology', 'Workforce']",,2006/11/25 09:00,2007/05/24 09:00,['2006/11/25 09:00'],"['2005/11/09 00:00 [received]', '2006/09/22 00:00 [revised]', '2006/10/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2006/11/25 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/05/24 09:00 [medline]', '2006/11/25 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0009-2797(06)00290-0 [pii]', '10.1016/j.cbi.2006.10.004 [doi]']",ppublish,Chem Biol Interact. 2007 Mar 20;166(1-3):15-24. doi: 10.1016/j.cbi.2006.10.004.

This work was set to establish a mechanistic link between dicoumarol, superoxide and cell cycle alterations in HL-60 cells. Using ES936, a mechanism-based irreversible inhibitor of NQO1, we demonstrate that NQO1 inhibition is not a major factor involved in superoxide boost. Mitochondrial Complexes II, III and IV were directly inhibited by dicoumarol. Succinate, which inhibits superoxide generation by reversed electron flow in Complex II, significantly decreased superoxide boost in dicoumarol-treated cells and in isolated mitochondria incubated with dicoumarol and decylubiquinol. Superoxide generation in cells was strongly potentiated by blocking the quinone site of Complex II with thenoyltrifluoroacetone, supporting the involvement of cytochrome b560 to drive electrons for increasing superoxide. Simultaneous inhibition of the mitochondrial chain upstream ubiquinone and displacement of succinate from the Complex II active site is proposed as a major mechanism to explain how dicoumarol increases superoxide in HL-60 cells. Dicoumarol-treated cells accumulated in S phase due to the impairment of pyrimidine biosynthesis at dihydroorotate dehydrogenase step because blockade was overcome by addition of exogenous uridine or orotate, but not by dihydroorotate. We demonstrate for the first time that dicoumarol inhibits mitochondrial electron transport, induces superoxide release by reversed electron flow in Complex II, and inhibits pyrimidines biosynthesis. These actions must be taken into account when considering dicoumarol effects on cells.","['Gonzalez-Aragon, David', 'Ariza, Julia', 'Villalba, Jose M']","['Gonzalez-Aragon D', 'Ariza J', 'Villalba JM']","['Departamento de Biologia Celular, Fisiologia e Inmunologia, Facultad de Ciencias, Universidad de Cordoba, Campus Rabanales, Edificio Severo Ochoa, 3(a) planta, 14014 Cordoba, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20061021,England,Biochem Pharmacol,Biochemical pharmacology,0101032,"['0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '11062-77-4 (Superoxides)', '326-91-0 (Thenoyltrifluoroacetone)', '7QID3E7BG7 (Dicumarol)', 'EC 1.3.5.1 (Electron Transport Complex II)', 'EC 1.6.5.2 (NAD(P)H Dehydrogenase (Quinone))', 'EC 1.6.5.2 (NQO1 protein, human)', 'EC 1.9.3.1 (Electron Transport Complex IV)', 'EC 7.1.1.8 (Electron Transport Complex III)', 'K8CXK5Q32L (pyrimidine)']",IM,"['Dicumarol/*pharmacology', 'Electron Transport/drug effects', 'Electron Transport Complex II/antagonists & inhibitors/physiology', 'Electron Transport Complex III/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Electron Transport Complex IV/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Mitochondria/*drug effects/metabolism', 'NAD(P)H Dehydrogenase (Quinone)/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Pyrimidines/*biosynthesis', 'S Phase/drug effects', 'Superoxides/metabolism', 'Thenoyltrifluoroacetone/pharmacology']",,2006/11/25 09:00,2007/02/28 09:00,['2006/11/25 09:00'],"['2006/08/24 00:00 [received]', '2006/10/13 00:00 [revised]', '2006/10/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2006/11/25 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/02/28 09:00 [medline]', '2006/11/25 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-2952(06)00668-X [pii]', '10.1016/j.bcp.2006.10.016 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Pharmacol. 2007 Feb 1;73(3):427-39. doi: 10.1016/j.bcp.2006.10.016.

Macrophages secrete lactadherin, a PS-binding protein, which tethers apoptotic cells to macrophage integrins. METHODS: We utilized fluorescein-labeled lactadherin together with the benchmark PS Probe, annexin V, to detect PS exposure by flow cytometry and confocal microscopy. Immortalized leukemia cells were treated with etoposide, and the kinetics and topology of PS exposure were followed over the course of apoptosis. RESULTS: Costaining etoposide-treated leukemoid cells with lactadherin and annexin V indicated progressive PS exposure with dim, intermediate, and bright staining. Confocal microscopy revealed localized plasma membrane staining, then diffuse dim staining by lactadherin prior to bright generalized staining with both proteins. Annexin V was primarily localized to internal cell bodies at early stages but stained the plasma membrane at the late stage. Calibration studies suggested a PS content less, less than or approximately equal to 2.5%-8% for the membrane domains that stained with lactadherin but not annexin V. CONCLUSIONS: Macrophages may utilize lactadherin to detect PS exposure prior to exposure of sufficient PS to bind annexin V. The methodology enables detection of PS exposure at earlier stages than established methodology.","['Shi, Jialan', 'Shi, Yinan', 'Waehrens, Lasse N', 'Rasmussen, Jan T', 'Heegaard, Christian W', 'Gilbert, Gary E']","['Shi J', 'Shi Y', 'Waehrens LN', 'Rasmussen JT', 'Heegaard CW', 'Gilbert GE']","[""Department of Medicine, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Cytometry A,Cytometry.

They often show a protracted or chronic course; however, all have the potential of progressing to severe marrow failure, associated with myelofibrosis, or of transforming into acute leukemia. At that point, hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) is the only current treatment strategy with curative potential. If transplantation is being considered and a suitable donor is available, HCT should be carried out before leukemic transformation has occurred, as the success rate of HCT declines steeply in patients who have evolved to leukemia. As many as 75-80% of patients with the original diagnoses of PV or ET, about 65-70% with CIMF, and 45% of patients with CMML are surviving long term after allogeneic HCT using conventional transplant regimens, with follow-up now extending to 15 years. Results with HLA-identical related and unrelated donors are comparable. Major risk factors for the outcome after HCT are the disease stage, the presence of comorbid conditions, and patient age. The development of reduced-intensity conditioning regimens has allowed for successful HCT even for older patients and patients with comorbid conditions. Studies on disease mechanisms, including the recent characterization of an activating mutation in JAK2, may provide additional prognostic guidance and are likely to lead to the development of novel treatment strategies, which will require continuous reassessment as to the optimum timing of HCT.","['Tse, William', 'Deeg, H Joachim']","['Tse W', 'Deeg HJ']","['Division of Hematology/Oncology, Ireland Cancer Center, University Hospitals of Cleveland, Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine, Cleveland, OH, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', 'Review']",20061121,Switzerland,Arch Immunol Ther Exp (Warsz),Archivum immunologiae et therapiae experimentalis,0114365,['0 (Histocompatibility Antigens)'],IM,"['Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Chronic Disease/therapy', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/methods', 'Histocompatibility Antigens/physiology', 'Humans', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Meta-Analysis as Topic', 'Middle Aged', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/pathology/*therapy', 'Transplantation Conditioning', 'Transplantation, Autologous', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",34,2006/11/24 09:00,2007/03/17 09:00,['2006/11/24 09:00'],"['2006/09/13 00:00 [received]', '2006/10/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2006/11/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/03/17 09:00 [medline]', '2006/11/24 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s00005-006-0044-9 [doi]'],ppublish,Arch Immunol Ther Exp (Warsz). 2006 Nov-Dec;54(6):375-80. doi: 10.1007/s00005-006-0044-9.

HPR is an effective chemopreventive agent for prostate, cervix, breast, bladder, skin and lung cancers, and has shown promise for the treatment of neuroblastomas. We have previously shown that HPR inhibits proliferation and induces apoptosis of human T-cell lymphotropic virus type I (HTLV-I)-associated adult T-cell leukemia (ATL) and HTLV-I-negative malignant T cells, whereas no effect is observed on normal lymphocytes. In this report, we identified HPR-induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation as the key mediator of cell cycle arrest and apoptosis of malignant T cells. HPR treatment of HTLV-I-negative malignant T cells was associated with a rapid and progressive ROS accumulation. Pre-treatment with the antioxidants vitamin C and dithiothreitol inhibited ROS generation, prevented HPR-induced ceramide accumulation, cell cycle arrest, cytochrome c release, caspase-activation and apoptosis. Therefore, anti-oxidants protected malignant T cells from HPR-induced growth inhibition. The expression of the HTLV-I oncoprotein Tax abrogated HPR-induced ROS accumulation in HTLV-I-infected cells, which explains their lower sensitivity to HPR. Defining the mechanism of free radical induction by HPR may support a potential therapeutic role for this synthetic retinoid in ATL and HTLV-I-negative T-cell lymphomas.","['Darwiche, N', 'Abou-Lteif, G', 'Bazarbachi, A']","['Darwiche N', 'Abou-Lteif G', 'Bazarbachi A']","['Department of Biology, American University of Beirut, Beirut, Lebanon. darwichn@aub.edu.lb']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20061123,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Anticarcinogenic Agents)', '0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '187EJ7QEXL (Fenretinide)']",IM,"['Anticarcinogenic Agents/pharmacology', 'Cell Death/*drug effects', 'Fenretinide/*pharmacology', 'Gene Products, tax/*pharmacology', '*Human T-lymphotropic virus 1', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism', 'T-Lymphocytes/drug effects/*physiology', 'U937 Cells']",,2006/11/24 09:00,2007/09/26 09:00,['2006/11/24 09:00'],"['2006/11/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/09/26 09:00 [medline]', '2006/11/24 09:00 [entrez]']","['2404472 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.leu.2404472 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2007 Feb;21(2):261-9. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2404472.

CD33-specific binding triggers internalization of GO and subsequent hydrolytic release of calicheamicin. Calicheamicin then translocates to the nucleus, intercalates in the DNA structure and subsequently induces double-strand DNA breaks. GO is part of clinical practice for AML, but is frequently associated with severe side effects. Therefore, combination of GO with other therapeutics is warranted to reduce toxicity, while maximizing therapeutic selectivity. We hypothesized that the histone deacetylase inhibitor valproic acid (VPA) sensitizes AML cells to GO. VPA-induced histone hyperacetylation opens the chromatin structure, whereby the DNA intercalation of calicheamicin should be augmented. We found that clinically relevant concentrations of VPA potently augmented the tumoricidal activity of GO towards AML cell lines and primary AML blasts. Moreover, VPA treatment indeed augmented the DNA intercalation of calicheamicin and enhanced DNA degradation. Importantly, synergy was restricted to CD33-positive AML cells and did not require caspase activation. In conclusion, the synergistic proapoptotic activity of cotreatment of AML cells with VPA and GO indicates the potential value of this strategy for AML.","['ten Cate, B', 'Samplonius, D F', 'Bijma, T', 'de Leij, L F M H', 'Helfrich, W', 'Bremer, E']","['ten Cate B', 'Samplonius DF', 'Bijma T', 'de Leij LF', 'Helfrich W', 'Bremer E']","['Laboratory for Tumor Immunology, Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Groningen University Institute for Drug Exploration, Section Medical Biology, University Medical Center Groningen, University of Groningen, Groningen, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20061123,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Aminoglycosides)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized)', '0 (Anticonvulsants)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, Myelomonocytic)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (CD33 protein, human)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors)', '0 (Intercalating Agents)', '0 (Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 3)', '614OI1Z5WI (Valproic Acid)', '93NS566KF7 (Gemtuzumab)']",IM,"['Aminoglycosides/*therapeutic use', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/*therapeutic use', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized', 'Anticonvulsants/toxicity', 'Antigens, CD/blood', 'Antigens, Differentiation, Myelomonocytic/blood', 'Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'DNA, Neoplasm/drug effects', 'Drug Synergism', 'Gemtuzumab', '*Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors', 'Humans', 'Intercalating Agents/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*pathology', 'Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 3', 'U937 Cells', 'Valproic Acid/*toxicity']",,2006/11/24 09:00,2007/09/26 09:00,['2006/11/24 09:00'],"['2006/11/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/09/26 09:00 [medline]', '2006/11/24 09:00 [entrez]']","['2404477 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.leu.2404477 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2007 Feb;21(2):248-52. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2404477.

Considering the percentage of somatic mutations present in the VH gene sequences and using the 98% cut-off value, 38 of the 55 B-CLL (69%) patients displayed somatic hypermutations and 17 (31%) had a germline configuration. Our results confirm and extend the observations of a bias in the use of certain VH, DH, and JH genes among B-CLL cells. The most frequently used VH genes were VH1-69 (12.7%) with VH3-23 (12.7%) and VH4-34 (10.9%). Collectively these genes accounted for 36.3% of the cases. In the mutated cases, the range of mutations varied from 2% to 15%, with a median of 6.5%. VH1-69 (7 cases, all unmutated) carried few mutations as opposed to VH3-23 (7 cases, 5 of which mutated), VH4-34 (6 cases, all mutated), and VH3-30 (5 cases, all mutated), which show a high load of mutations. D3 family genes were found frequently (38.1%) followed by D2 (27.2%) and D6 (18.1%). The individual D segment most frequently used was D3-3, which was present in 16.3% of cases. There was predominance of the JH4 gene (49%) followed by JH6 (40%). Analysis of the distribution of replacement and silent mutations in the mutated sequences using the method of Lossos showed in 39.4% of cases evidence of antigen selection in the framework region and/or complementary determining regions. In comparison with a recent study on B-CLL patients from the Mediterranean area, the VH4-34 gene was significantly overused in the mutated group at a percentage double that of the Italian cohort reported in this study (10.9% vs. 5%), but at a frequency similar to the entire Mediterranean region (10.7%). We also found an over-representation of VH1-69 usage in the germline group, at a frequency (12.7%) higher than previously described by the same authors (Italian 8%, Mediterranean 10.7%). On the contrary, VH3-07 and VH3-49 were not much used in our study (5.4% and 1.8%, respectively) compared with the Italian group (8% and 5.1%). In our study, VH3-23 gene segment was frequently expressed, at frequency as high as that of VH1-69, a finding in keeping with reported B-CLL Italian data, but higher than the entire series of the Mediterranean area (12.7% vs. 9.2%); VH3-21 gene, frequently expressed in northern European CLL but rarely in the Mediterranean area, was completely absent. This biased usage of VH family genes may reflect a geographic leukemic repertoire, perhaps owing to a peculiar genetic background, depending on variations in germline composition of the IgVH locus or to the effect of a potential environmental element less frequently encountered in different regions.","['Donisi, Pietro Maria', 'Di Lorenzo, Nadia', 'Riccardi, Manuela', 'Paparella, Alessandro', 'Sarpellon, Claudia', 'Zupo, Simona', 'Bertoldero, Giovanni', 'Minotto, Claudia', 'Stracca-Pansa, Vincenzo']","['Donisi PM', 'Di Lorenzo N', 'Riccardi M', 'Paparella A', 'Sarpellon C', 'Zupo S', 'Bertoldero G', 'Minotto C', 'Stracca-Pansa V']","['Department of Pathology, Venice, Italy. pietromaria.donisi@ulss12.ve.it']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Diagn Mol Pathol,"Diagnostic molecular pathology : the American journal of surgical pathology, part B",9204924,"['0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Complementarity Determining Regions)', '0 (Immunoglobulin D)', '0 (Immunoglobulin J-Chains)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*genetics', 'Cohort Studies', 'Complementarity Determining Regions/genetics', 'Female', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Gene Frequency', '*Gene Rearrangement, B-Lymphocyte, Heavy Chain', '*Genes, Immunoglobulin Heavy Chain', 'Germ-Line Mutation', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin D/genetics', 'Immunoglobulin J-Chains/genetics', 'Italy', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*genetics/immunology/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', 'Severity of Illness Index', 'Somatic Hypermutation, Immunoglobulin']",,2006/11/24 09:00,2007/01/20 09:00,['2006/11/24 09:00'],"['2006/11/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/01/20 09:00 [medline]', '2006/11/24 09:00 [entrez]']","['10.1097/01.pdm.0000213469.85301.d6 [doi]', '00019606-200612000-00003 [pii]']",ppublish,Diagn Mol Pathol. 2006 Dec;15(4):206-15. doi: 10.1097/01.pdm.0000213469.85301.d6.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Our results demonstrate that retroviral mutagenesis can be a potent tool for miRNA discovery.","['Wang, Clifford L', 'Wang, Bruce B', 'Bartha, Gabor', 'Li, Lauri', 'Channa, Namitha', 'Klinger, Mark', 'Killeen, Nigel', 'Wabl, Matthias']","['Wang CL', 'Wang BB', 'Bartha G', 'Li L', 'Channa N', 'Klinger M', 'Killeen N', 'Wabl M']","['Department of Microbiology and Immunology, University of California-San Francisco, San Francisco, CA 94143, USA. cliff.wang@stanford.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20061122,United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (RNA, Viral)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Viral', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Experimental/genetics/virology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'MicroRNAs/*metabolism', 'Oncogenes/*physiology', 'Proviruses/*genetics', 'RNA, Neoplasm/*metabolism', 'RNA, Viral/*metabolism', 'Retroviridae Infections/genetics/virology', 'Tumor Virus Infections/genetics/virology', 'Virus Integration/*physiology']",,2006/11/24 09:00,2007/02/03 09:00,['2006/11/24 09:00'],"['2006/11/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/02/03 09:00 [medline]', '2006/11/24 09:00 [entrez]']","['0609030103 [pii]', '10.1073/pnas.0609030103 [doi]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2006 Dec 5;103(49):18680-4. doi: 10.1073/pnas.0609030103.

We provide evidence that during treatment of BCR-ABL-expressing cells with As(2)O(3), there is activation of a cellular pathway involving the p70 S6 kinase (p70S6K). Our data show that p70S6K is rapidly phosphorylated on Thr(421) and Ser(424) and is activated in an As(2)O(3)-inducible manner. The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) is also phosphorylated/activated in an As(2)O(3)-inducible manner, and its activity is required for downstream engagement of p70S6K. p70S6K subsequently phosphorylates the S6 ribosomal protein on Ser(235)/Ser(236) and Ser(240)/Ser(244) to promote initiation of mRNA translation. Treatment of chronic myelogenous leukemia-derived cell lines with As(2)O(3) also results in phosphorylation of the 4E-BP1 repressor of mRNA translation on Thr(37)/Thr(46) and Thr(70), sites required for its deactivation and its dissociation from the eukaryotic initiation factor 4E complex to allow cap-dependent mRNA translation. In studies to determine the functional relevance of this pathway, we found that inhibition of mTOR and downstream cascades enhances induction of apoptosis by As(2)O(3). Consistent with this, the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin strongly potentiated As(2)O(3)-mediated suppression of primitive leukemic progenitors from the bone marrow of chronic myelogenous leukemia patients. Altogether, our data show that the mTOR/p70S6K pathway is activated in a negative feedback regulatory manner in response to As(2)O(3) in BCR-ABL-transformed cells and plays a key regulatory role in the induction of anti-leukemic responses.","['Yoon, Patrick', 'Giafis, Nick', 'Smith, Jessica', 'Mears, Heather', 'Katsoulidis, Efstratios', 'Sassano, Antonella', 'Altman, Jessica', 'Redig, Amanda J', 'Tallman, Martin S', 'Platanias, Leonidas C']","['Yoon P', 'Giafis N', 'Smith J', 'Mears H', 'Katsoulidis E', 'Sassano A', 'Altman J', 'Redig AJ', 'Tallman MS', 'Platanias LC']","['Robert H.

EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We studied the effect of arsenic trioxide on patient samples and the AML cell line HEL, which, like leukemic blasts from 50% of AML cases, has constitutively activated signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) proteins. RESULTS: Arsenic trioxide induced mitotic arrest starting at 24 hours and significant cell death at 48 hours. These events were preceded by an arsenic trioxide dose-dependent down-regulation of activated STAT proteins starting at 6 hours. We hypothesized that arsenic trioxide inhibits protein tyrosine kinases (PTK), which, among others, phosphorylate and activate STATs. We therefore studied arsenic trioxide effects on Janus kinases and on three oncogenic PTKs that are known to activate STATs [FLT3, ZNF198/fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 (FGFR1), and BCR/ABL]. Arsenic trioxide reduced STAT3 activation by Janus kinases, altered phosphorylation and electrophoretic mobility of ZNF198/fibroblast growth factor receptor 1, reduced kinase protein level, and decreased STAT3 protein phosphorylation. Arsenic trioxide also reduced the phosphorylation of BCR/ABL and FLT3 with corresponding decreased STAT5 phosphorylation. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest a selective activity of arsenic trioxide on PTKs and will assist in developing clinical trials in AML.","['Wetzler, Meir', 'Brady, Michael T', 'Tracy, Erin', 'Li, Zhang-Rong', 'Donohue, Kathleen A', ""O'Loughlin, Kieran L"", 'Cheng, Yijun', 'Mortazavi, Amir', 'McDonald, Amy A', 'Kunapuli, Padmaja', 'Wallace, Paul K', 'Baer, Maria R', 'Cowell, John K', 'Baumann, Heinz']","['Wetzler M', 'Brady MT', 'Tracy E', 'Li ZR', 'Donohue KA', ""O'Loughlin KL"", 'Cheng Y', 'Mortazavi A', 'McDonald AA', 'Kunapuli P', 'Wallace PK', 'Baer MR', 'Cowell JK', 'Baumann H']","['Leukemia Section, Department of Medicine, Roswell Park Cancer Institute, Buffalo, New York 14263, USA. meir.wetzler@roswellpark.org']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (CEP43 protein, human)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Oxides)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (STAT Transcription Factors)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (ZMYM2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Carrier Proteins/metabolism', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/metabolism', 'Oxides/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/metabolism', 'STAT Transcription Factors/*metabolism', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Transcription Factors', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,2006/11/24 09:00,2007/02/07 09:00,['2006/11/24 09:00'],"['2006/11/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/02/07 09:00 [medline]', '2006/11/24 09:00 [entrez]']","['12/22/6817 [pii]', '10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-06-1354 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2006 Nov 15;12(22):6817-25. doi: 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-06-1354.,,,,,PMC2649745,,"['P30 CA016056/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA16056/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA85580/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R21 CA099238-02/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA76167/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA99238/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA085580/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA076167/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R21 CA099238/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R21 CA099238-01A1/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",['NIHMS82726'],,,,,,,,,,,

We demonstrate herein for the first time that highly selective sigma ligands inhibit volume-regulated chloride channels (VRCC) in small cell lung cancer and T-leukemia cells. Sigma ligands and VRCC blockers provoked a cell cycle arrest underlined by p27 accumulation. In stably sigma-1 receptor-transfected HEK cells, the proliferation rate was significantly lowered by sigma ligands when compared with control cells. Sigma ligands produced a strong inhibition of VRCC in HEK-transfected cells but not in control HEK. Surprisingly, the activation rate of VRCC was dramatically delayed in HEK-transfected cells in the absence of ligands, indicating that sigma-1 receptors per se modulate cell regulating volume processes in physiological conditions. Volume measurements in hypotonic conditions revealed indeed that the regulatory volume decrease was delayed in HEK-transfected cells and virtually abolished in the presence of igmesine in both HEK-transfected and T-leukemic cells. Moreover, HEK-transfected cells showed a significant resistance to staurosporine-induced apoptosis volume decrease, indicating that sigma-1 receptors protect cancer cells from apoptosis.

HTLV-2 is highly related to HTLV-1 at the genetic level and shares a high degree of sequence homology, but infection with HTLV-2 is relatively nonpathogenic compared to HTLV-1. Although the pathogenesis of HAM/TSP remains to be fully elucidated, previous evidence suggests that elevated levels of the proinflammatory cytokines in the CNS are associated with neuropathogenesis. We demonstrate that HTLV-1 infection in astrogliomas results in a robust induction of interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta), IL-1alpha, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), TNF-beta, and IL-6 expression. HTLV encodes for a viral transcriptional transactivator protein named Tax that also induces the transcription of cellular genes. To investigate and compare the effects of Tax1 and Tax2 expression on the dysregulation of proinflammatory cytokines, lentivirus vectors were used to transduce primary human astrocytomas and oligodendrogliomas. The expression of Tax1 in primary human astrocytomas and oligodendrogliomas resulted in significantly higher levels of proinflammatory cytokine gene expression compared to Tax2. Notably, Tax1 expression uniquely sensitized primary human astrocytomas to apoptosis. A Tax2/Tax1 chimera encoding the C-terminal 53 amino acids of the Tax1 fused to the Tax2 gene (Tax(221)) demonstrated a phenotype that resembled Tax1, with respect to proinflammatory cytokine gene expression and sensitization to apoptosis. The patterns of differential cytokine induction and sensitization to apoptosis displayed by Tax1 and Tax2 may reflect differences relating to the heightened neuropathogenicity associated with HTLV-1 infection and the development of HAM/TSP.","['Banerjee, Prabal', 'Rochford, Rosemary', 'Antel, J', 'Canute, G', 'Wrzesinski, Stephen', 'Sieburg, Michelle', 'Feuer, Gerold']","['Banerjee P', 'Rochford R', 'Antel J', 'Canute G', 'Wrzesinski S', 'Sieburg M', 'Feuer G']","['Department of Microbiology and Immunology, SUNY Upstate Medical University, 750 East Adams Street, Syracuse, NY 13210, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20061122,United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Gene Products, tax)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/genetics', 'Cell Line', 'Cytokines/*genetics/metabolism', 'Gene Products, tax/*genetics', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/pathogenicity', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 2/pathogenicity', 'Humans', 'Neuroglia/*immunology/*virology', 'Paraparesis, Tropical Spastic/virology', '*Transcriptional Activation', 'Transduction, Genetic']",,2006/11/24 09:00,2007/03/21 09:00,['2006/11/24 09:00'],"['2006/11/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/03/21 09:00 [medline]', '2006/11/24 09:00 [entrez]']","['JVI.01513-06 [pii]', '10.1128/JVI.01513-06 [doi]']",ppublish,J Virol. 2007 Feb;81(4):1690-700. doi: 10.1128/JVI.01513-06.

No connection between these data has, however, been established. Here, we show that dmlf is widely and dynamically expressed during fly development. We isolated and analyzed the first dmlf mutants: embryos lacking maternal dmlf product have a low viability with no specific defect, and dmlf(-)- adults display weak phenotypes. We monitored dMLF subcellular localization in the fly and cultured cells. We were able to show that, although generally nuclear, dMLF can also be cytoplasmic, depending on the developmental context. Furthermore, two differently spliced variants of dMLF display differential subcellular localization, allowing the identification of regions of dMLF potentially important for its localization.

MDR cancer cells are characterized by the overexpression of multidrug resistance1(MDR1) gene which encodes P-glycoprotein (Pgp), a surface protein of tumor cells that functions to produce an excessive efflux and thereby an insufficient intracellular concentration of chemotherapeutic agents. A variety of studies have sought potent MDR modulators to decrease MDR1 gene expression in cancer cells. Our previous study has shown that curcumin exhibits characteristics of a MDR modulator in KB-V1 multidrug-resistant cells. The aim of this study was to further investigate the effect of curcumin on MDR1 gene expression in patient leukemic cells. The leukemic cells were collected from 78 childhood leukemia patients admitted at Maharaj Nakorn Chiang Mai Hospital, Chiang Mai, Thailand, in the period from July 2003 to February 2005. There were 61 cases of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), 14 cases of acute myeloblastic leukemia (AML), and 3 cases of chronic myelocytic leukemia (CML). There were 47 males and 31 females ranging from 1 to 15 years old. Bone marrows were collected. The leukemic cells were separated and cultured in the presence or absence of 10 microM curcumin for 48 hours. MDR1 mRNA levels were determined by RT-PCR. It was found that curcumin reduced MDR1 gene expression in the cells from 33 patients (42%). Curcumin affected the MDR1 gene expression in 5 of 11 relapsed cases (45%), 10 of 26 cases of drug maintenance (38%), 7 of 18 cases of completed treatment (39%), and 11 of 23 cases of new patients (48%). The expression levels of MDR1 gene in leukemic patient cells as compared to that of KB-V1 cells were classified as low level (1-20%) in 5 of 20 cases (25%), medium level (21-60%) in 14 of 32 cases (44%), and high level (61-100%) in 14 of 20 cases (70%). In summary, curcumin decreased MDR1 mRNA level in patient leukemic cells, especially in high level of MDR1 gene groups. Thus, curcumin treatment may provide a lead for clinical treatment of leukemia patients in the future.","['Anuchapreeda, Songyot', 'Thanarattanakorn, Pattra', 'Sittipreechacharn, Somjai', 'Tima, Singkome', 'Chanarat, Prasit', 'Limtrakul, Pornngarm']","['Anuchapreeda S', 'Thanarattanakorn P', 'Sittipreechacharn S', 'Tima S', 'Chanarat P', 'Limtrakul P']","['Division of Clinical Microscopy, Department of Medical Technology, Faculty of Associated Medical Sciences, Chiang Mai University, Chiang Mai, 50200, Thailand. sanuchapreeda@yahoo.com']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Korea (South),Arch Pharm Res,Archives of pharmacal research,8000036,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', 'IT942ZTH98 (Curcumin)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Age Factors', 'Antineoplastic Agents/chemistry/pharmacology', 'Bone Marrow/drug effects/metabolism/pathology', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Child, Preschool', 'Curcumin/*pharmacology', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/*drug effects', 'Genes, MDR/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/blood/genetics/pathology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/blood/genetics/pathology', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/blood/genetics/pathology', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/isolation & purification/metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction/methods', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,2006/11/24 09:00,2007/02/27 09:00,['2006/11/24 09:00'],"['2006/11/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/02/27 09:00 [medline]', '2006/11/24 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF02973907 [doi]'],ppublish,Arch Pharm Res. 2006 Oct;29(10):866-73. doi: 10.1007/BF02973907.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To investigate the anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant activity of these compounds, their effects on carrageenan-induced paw edema, arachidonic acid (AA)-induced ear edema and analgesic activity in acetic acid (HAc)-induced writhing response were carried out in vivo; cyclooxygenase (COX) activity, reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation in rat basophilic leukemia (RBL 2H3) cells and 1,1-diphenyl-2-picryl-hydroazyl (DPPH) scavenging activity were determined in vitro. These phenolic compounds not only had anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties in vivo, but also inhibited COX activity and silica-induced ROS generation in a dose-dependent manner. Among these phenolic compounds, compound VII was the most potent anti-inflammatory and analgesic. Compound VII significantly inhibited silica-induced ROS generation and compound VI significantly increased DPPH radical scavenging activity. Compounds I, II and III significantly inhibited the activity of COX-I and II. These results indicate that phenolic compounds of GE are anti-inflammatory, which may be related to inhibition of COX activity and to anti-oxidant activity. Consideration of the structure-activity relationship of the phenolic derivatives from GE on the anti-inflammatory action revealed that both C-4 hydroxy and C-3 methoxy radicals of benzyl aldehyde play an important role in anti-inflammatory activities.","['Lee, Ji Yun', 'Jang, Young Woon', 'Kang, Hyo Sook', 'Moon, Hee', 'Sim, Sang Soo', 'Kim, Chang Jong']","['Lee JY', 'Jang YW', 'Kang HS', 'Moon H', 'Sim SS', 'Kim CJ']","['Division of Pathophysiology and Pharmacology, College of Pharmacy, Chung-Ang University, Seoul 156-756, Korea.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Korea (South),Arch Pharm Res,Archives of pharmacal research,8000036,"['0 (Anti-Inflammatory Agents)', '0 (Benzyl Compounds)', '0 (Cyclooxygenase Inhibitors)', '0 (Phenols)', '0 (Plant Extracts)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '27YG812J1I (Arachidonic Acid)', '9000-07-1 (Carrageenan)', 'EC 1.14.99.1 (Prostaglandin-Endoperoxide Synthases)', 'Q40Q9N063P (Acetic Acid)', 'Y4S76JWI15 (Methanol)']",IM,"['Acetic Acid', 'Animals', 'Anti-Inflammatory Agents/chemistry/pharmacology', 'Arachidonic Acid', 'Benzyl Compounds/chemistry/pharmacology', 'Carrageenan', 'Cyclooxygenase Inhibitors/chemistry/isolation & purification/*pharmacology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Ear, External/drug effects/pathology', 'Edema/chemically induced/drug therapy', 'Gastrodia/*chemistry', 'Hindlimb/drug effects/pathology', 'Inflammation/chemically induced/prevention & control', 'Male', 'Methanol', 'Molecular Structure', 'Pain/chemically induced/drug therapy', 'Phenols/chemistry/isolation & purification/*pharmacology', 'Plant Extracts/chemistry/pharmacology', 'Prostaglandin-Endoperoxide Synthases/metabolism', 'Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Rats', 'Rats, Sprague-Dawley', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Rhizome/*chemistry']",,2006/11/24 09:00,2007/02/27 09:00,['2006/11/24 09:00'],"['2006/11/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/02/27 09:00 [medline]', '2006/11/24 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF02973905 [doi]'],ppublish,Arch Pharm Res. 2006 Oct;29(10):849-58. doi: 10.1007/BF02973905.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Genetic modification of MSCs with genes encoding tissue-specific growth factors and cytokines can induce and maintain lineage-specific differentiation. Due to anatomical and physiological similarities to humans, porcine research models have been proven valuable for the preclinical testing of tissue engineering protocols in large animals. The aim of this study was to evaluate optimized viral and non-viral ex vivo gene delivery systems with respect to gene transfer efficiency, maintenance of transgene expression, and safety issues using primary porcine MSCs as target cells. MATERIALS AND METHODS: MSCs were purified from bone marrow aspirates from the proximal tibiae of four 3-month-old Danish landrace pigs by Ficoll step gradient separation and polystyrene adherence technique. Vectors expressing enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP) and human bone morphogenetic protein-2 (BMP-2) were transferred to the cells by different non-viral methods and by use of recombinant adeno-associated virus (rAAV)-mediated and retroviral gene delivery. Each method for gene delivery was optimized. Gene transfer efficiency was compared on the basis of eGFP expression as assessed by fluorescence microscopy and fluorescence-activated flow cytometry. BMP-2 gene expression and osteogenic differentiation were evaluated by realtime quantitative RT-PCR and histochemical detection of alkaline phosphatase activity, respectively. RESULTS: Non-viral gene delivery methods resulted in transient eGFP expression by less than 2% of the cells. Using high titer rAAV-based vector up to 90% of the cells were transiently transduced. The efficiency of rAAV-mediated gene delivery was proportional to the rAAV vector titer applied. Retroviral gene delivery resulted in long-term transgene expression of porcine MSCs. A 26-fold increase in percentage of eGFP expressing cells (1.7%+/-0.2% versus 44.1% +/-5.0%, mean +/-SD) and a 68-fold increase in mean fluorescence intensity (327.4+/-56.6 versus 4.8+/-1.3) was observed by centrifugation of retroviral particles onto the target cell layer. Porcine MSCs that were BMP-2 transduced by optimized retroviral gene delivery demonstrated a significant increase in BMP-2 gene expression and showed increased osteogenic differentiation. Retrovirally transduced porcine MSCs were furthermore tested free of replication-competent viruses. DISCUSSION: The non-viral gene transfer methods applied were significantly less efficient compared to the viral methods tested. However, due to advantages with respect to safety issues and ease of handling, improvement of non-viral gene delivery to primary MSCs deserves further attention. The high efficiency of rAAV-mediated gene delivery observed at high titers can be explained by the ability of rAAV vector to transduce nondividing cells and by its tropism towards porcine MSCs. rAAV-mediated gene delivery resulted in transient transgene expression due to lack of stable AAV genome integration. MLV-mediated retroviral gene delivery can be considered a safe method for long-term transgene expression by porcine MSCs, and is therefore particularly attractive for advanced tissue engineering strategies requiring extended transgene expression.","['Stiehler, Maik', 'Duch, Mogens', 'Mygind, Tina', 'Li, Haisheng', 'Ulrich-Vinther, Michael', 'Modin, Charlotte', 'Baatrup, Anette', 'Lind, Martin', 'Pedersen, Finn S', 'Bunger, Cody E']","['Stiehler M', 'Duch M', 'Mygind T', 'Li H', 'Ulrich-Vinther M', 'Modin C', 'Baatrup A', 'Lind M', 'Pedersen FS', 'Bunger CE']","['Orthopaedic Research Laboratory, Department of Orthopaedic Surgery E, Aarhus University Hospital, Aarhus, Denmark. maik.stiehler@ki.au.dk']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Adv Exp Med Biol,Advances in experimental medicine and biology,0121103,"['0 (BMP2 protein, human)', '0 (Bmp2 protein, mouse)', '0 (Bone Morphogenetic Protein 2)', '0 (Bone Morphogenetic Proteins)', '0 (Transforming Growth Factor beta)', '147336-22-9 (Green Fluorescent Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Bone Morphogenetic Protein 2', 'Bone Morphogenetic Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Cell Line', '*Gene Transfer Techniques', 'Green Fluorescent Proteins/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/metabolism', 'Mesenchymal Stem Cells/*cytology', 'Mice', 'NIH 3T3 Cells', 'Retroviridae/metabolism', 'Swine', 'Tibia/pathology', 'Tissue Engineering', 'Transforming Growth Factor beta/genetics/metabolism', 'Transgenes']",,2006/11/24 09:00,2007/03/16 09:00,['2006/11/24 09:00'],"['2006/11/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/03/16 09:00 [medline]', '2006/11/24 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/978-0-387-34133-0_3 [doi]'],ppublish,Adv Exp Med Biol. 2006;585:31-48. doi: 10.1007/978-0-387-34133-0_3.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Cells were divided into control group, AS group (MDM2 specific antisense oligonucleotides group), cisplatin group, and combined treatment group. FCM analysis and Western blot and RT-PCR were used to estimate apoptosis and the expression of MDM2 and P53. Our results showed that the transfection of MDM2 specific antisense oligonucleotides obviously inhibited MDM2 expression (P < 0.01) and increased the expression of P53 (P < 0.05). Apoptosis rate were reduced by MDM2 specific antisense oligonucletides and cisplatin (P < 0.01).

We examined the effect of autologous serum on the properties of leukemic DCs derived from leukemic cells of AML patients by culture in AIM-V medium with GM-CSF, IL-4, TNF-alpha, and 0, 2, 5, or 10% human autologous serum. The expressions of CD80, CD83, CD86, and HLA-DR were upregulated under all culture conditions; however, 10% autologous serum induced the highest expression levels of several molecules. The capacity of leukemic DCs to stimulate allogeneic T cells increased with increasing serum concentration. Stimulation of autologous CD3(+) T cells with leukemic DCs grown in the presence of various concentrations of autologous serum resulted in induction of more IFN-gamma-secreting cells than was the case for unprimed CD3(+) T cells. Leukemic DCs cultured with 10% autologous serum induced the highest numbers of IFN-gamma-secreting cells and CD8(+)CD56(+) T cells from autologous T cells. These results suggest that culture of AML blast cells in the presence of autologous serum could be used to generate leukemic DCs for immunotherapy against AML. The highest serum concentration appeared optimal for generating the most potent leukemic DCs.","['Choi, Bo-Hwa', 'Kang, Hyun-Kyu', 'Park, Jung-Sun', 'Kim, Sang-Ki', 'Pham, Than-Nhan Nguyen', 'Zhu, Xiao-Wei', 'Cho, Duck', 'Nam, Jong-Hee', 'Chung, Ik-Joo', 'Kim, Young-Jin', 'Rhee, Joon-Haeng', 'Kim, Hyeoung-Joon', 'Lee, Je-Jung']","['Choi BH', 'Kang HK', 'Park JS', 'Kim SK', 'Pham TN', 'Zhu XW', 'Cho D', 'Nam JH', 'Chung IJ', 'Kim YJ', 'Rhee JH', 'Kim HJ', 'Lee JJ']","['Department of Hematology-Oncology, Chonnam National University Medical School, Gwangju, Korea.']",['eng'],"['Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,J Clin Apher,Journal of clinical apheresis,8216305,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (B7-1 Antigen)', '0 (B7-2 Antigen)', '0 (CD83 antigen)', '0 (Culture Media)', '0 (HLA-DR Antigens)', '0 (Immunoglobulins)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '207137-56-2 (Interleukin-4)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Antigens, CD/analysis', 'B7-1 Antigen/analysis', 'B7-2 Antigen/analysis', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Culture Media/*pharmacology', 'Dendritic Cells/*cytology/immunology/metabolism/transplantation', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Female', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/pharmacology', 'HLA-DR Antigens/analysis', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulins/analysis', '*Immunotherapy', 'Interferon-gamma/metabolism', 'Interleukin-4/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/pathology/*therapy', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Lymphocyte Culture Test, Mixed', 'Male', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/analysis', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/cytology/*drug effects', '*Serum', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Transplantation, Autologous', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/cytology/drug effects/transplantation', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/pharmacology']",,2006/11/23 09:00,2007/03/03 09:00,['2006/11/23 09:00'],"['2006/11/23 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/03/03 09:00 [medline]', '2006/11/23 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/jca.20105 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Apher. 2006 Dec;21(4):233-40. doi: 10.1002/jca.20105.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: For this multicenter, single-arm, Phase II study, 44 patients with treatment-naive, stage III or IV, indolent NHL (International Working Formulation subtypes A, B, and C) were enrolled. Patients received 0.14 mg/kg per day of 2-CdA as a 2-hour bolus infusion for 5 consecutive days every 28 days until maximal response or a total of 6 cycles. RESULTS: Thirty-eight patients were eligible for response evaluation. The overall response rate was 100% (95% confidence interval [95% CI], 90.8-100%), and the complete response rate was 31.6% (95% CI, 17.5-48.7%).

Six patients had sustained remissions that lasted a median of 8.7 years (range, from 5.9 years to > or =11 years). Although 68% of patients experienced at least 1 grade 3 or 4 event, consisting primarily of myelosuppression, severe infections were rare, with only 8 grade 3 infections.

Diagnostic biopsies are commonly collected from bulbar conjunctiva only. The aims of our study were to evaluate whether additional biopsies from the tarsal conjunctiva increase sensitivity upon histopathologic evaluation and to investigate the staining profile for common immunohistochemical markers in cnGvHD. We additionally propose an adaptive histological classification for cnGvHD analogous to Lerner's GvHD skin classification for predicting patient survival. METHODS: Formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded conjunctival specimens from 23 post-mortem control eyes and 42 patients after haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) were stained with haematoxylin and eosin (HE), periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) stain and with antibodies against CD1a, CD4, CD8, CD25, CD45RO, CD68, Fas ligand, TIA-1, HLA-DRalpha by means of immunohistochemistry. Cell counting took place in ten representative fields at 64.4 microm (length) x 21.2 microm (width). Multifactorial analysis of variance was performed to assess any influence of cnGvHD on the staining pattern for the immunohistochemical markers. Survival times were estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method. RESULTS: All 42 specimens and none of the controls were diagnosed as cnGvHD. The bulbar specimens were staged according to the modified Lerner classification: grade (G) I: 0; G II: 17 (tarsal with G<or=II, 2; G>II, 8); G III: 12 (tarsal with G<or=III: 2; G>III: 1); G IV: 12 (tarsal with G<or=IV: 6); G V: 1. The number of pairs with either the tarsal or bulbar counterpart being more severely affected was almost equal (10 vs 9). A tendency towards shorter survival in advanced bulbar cnGvHD was demonstrated (G III-V vs G I-II, p =0.06). Staining for the immunohistochemical markers in cnGvHD differed significantly from that in controls (p<0.01). Proposed markers for cnGvHD (e = epithelium, s = stroma; mean cell counts +/- SD; cnGvHD vs controls) are: CD8 s (15.7 +/- 18.4 vs 6 +/- 5.6), CD25 s (2.6 +/- 2.8 vs 0.7 +/- 1.6), CD68 s (8 +/- 9 vs 3.9 +/- 3.5) at the bulbar site and CD1a e (1.2 +/- 1.6 vs 0.3 +/- 0.6) and TIA-1 e (2.2 +/- 2.2 vs 1.1 +/- 1.3) at the tarsal site. CONCLUSIONS: Additional tarsal biopsy does not seem to add relevant diagnostic sensitivity for cnGvHD when the modified Lerner classification is applied. The modified Lerner classification of the bulbar cnGvHD seems to be of prognostic value.","['Auw-Haedrich, Claudia', 'Potsch, Christian', 'Bohringer, Daniel', 'Mittelviefhaus, Hans', 'Maier, Philip', 'Reinhard, Thomas', 'Freudenberg, Nikolaus', 'Finke, Jurgen', 'Coupland, Sarah E']","['Auw-Haedrich C', 'Potsch C', 'Bohringer D', 'Mittelviefhaus H', 'Maier P', 'Reinhard T', 'Freudenberg N', 'Finke J', 'Coupland SE']","['Eye Hospital, Albert-Ludwigs University, Killianstrasse 5, 79106 Freiburg, Germany. claudia.auw-haedrich@uniklinik-freiburg.de']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20061122,Germany,Graefes Arch Clin Exp Ophthalmol,Graefe's archive for clinical and experimental ophthalmology = Albrecht von Graefes Archiv fur klinische und experimentelle Ophthalmologie,8205248,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (HLA-DR Antigens)', '0 (Poly(A)-Binding Proteins)', '0 (T-Cell Intracellular Antigen-1)', '0 (TIA1 protein, human)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Antigens, CD/metabolism', 'Biomarkers/metabolism', 'Biopsy', 'Cell Count', 'Conjunctival Diseases/classification/*diagnosis/etiology/metabolism', 'Dry Eye Syndromes/etiology', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease/classification/*diagnosis/etiology/metabolism', 'HLA-DR Antigens/metabolism', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*adverse effects', 'Humans', 'Immunoenzyme Techniques', 'Leukemia/surgery', 'Lymphoma/surgery', 'Male', 'Poly(A)-Binding Proteins/metabolism', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'T-Cell Intracellular Antigen-1']",,2006/11/23 09:00,2007/11/07 09:00,['2006/11/23 09:00'],"['2005/11/24 00:00 [received]', '2006/09/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2006/08/29 00:00 [revised]', '2006/11/23 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/11/07 09:00 [medline]', '2006/11/23 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s00417-006-0448-6 [doi]'],ppublish,Graefes Arch Clin Exp Ophthalmol. 2007 Jul;245(7):1001-7. doi: 10.1007/s00417-006-0448-6.

Because diagnosis is still difficult, non-invasive diagnostic criteria were recently proposed by MSG/IFICG/EORTC for study purposes. We have analysed their usefulness in the clinical management of acute leukaemic patients with pulmonary infiltrates. Twenty-seven infiltrates developed during 174 chemotherapy cycles given to 50 consecutive patients. According to diagnostic criteria, IPA was diagnosed in 42% of patients and 77.8% of pulmonary infiltrates. AML diagnosis and the first induction cycle were significant risk factors. ""Proven"" IPA was rare, occurring in one patient (2%). The diagnosis of ""probable"" IPA was made in seven patients (14%) and was strongly supported by the significant association of characteristic radiological lesions (""major"" clinical criterion) with the positivity of one microbiological criterion (P = 0.026). Conversely, ""possible"" IPA was frequent (26%) because its pertinent diagnostic criteria were fulfilled in 48.1% of pulmonary infiltrates. However, in 84.6% of cases, the diagnosis of ""possible IPA"" aspecifically derived from the association of two conditions, a new pulmonary infiltrate with symptoms of lower respiratory tract infection (""minor clinical criterion""), together with the definition of ""susceptible"" host, which applied to 100% of our leukaemic patients. We conclude that, according to MSG/IFICG/EORTC criteria, a high number of pulmonary infiltrates would be diagnosed as IPA, but only a diagnosis of ""proven/probable"" IPA should be considered reliable in the clinical management of suspected IPA.","['Borlenghi, Erika', 'Cattaneo, Chiara', 'Capucci, Maria Adele', 'Pan, Angelo', 'Quaresmini, Giulia', 'Franco, Fabio', 'Grazioli, Luigi', 'Carosi, Gian Piero', 'Rossi, Giuseppe']","['Borlenghi E', 'Cattaneo C', 'Capucci MA', 'Pan A', 'Quaresmini G', 'Franco F', 'Grazioli L', 'Carosi GP', 'Rossi G']","['U.O.

The relationships between the number of 'mature' subsets of CD34+ cells (CD34+/CD33+, CD34+/CD38+, CD34+/DR+ and CD34+/CD90-) and 'immature' subsets of CD34+ cells (CD34+/CD33-, CD34+/CD38-, CD34+/DR- and CD34+/CD90+) and early and long-term hemoglobin, neutrophil and platelet counts were studied in a homogeneous series (for disease, pre-transplant chemotherapy, mobilization chemotherapy, conditioning regimen) of 26 AML patients after autologous PBSCT. Cell counts were performed before and after cryopreservation, but only after thawing were the cell counts used for correlation with early and long-term engraftment. The number of CD34+/CD38- cells infused correlated with the neutrophil (r = 0.88, p < 0.005) and platelet counts (r = 0.67, p < 0.05) at 12 months after PBSCT. This correlation was better than that for the total CD34+ cell dose at 12 months (r = 0.36, p = 0.09 for neutrophil count and r = 0.48, p = 0.06 for platelets count). The number of CD34+/CD90+ cells was also correlated with the platelet counts at 6 (r = 0.70, p < 0.05) and 12 months (r = 0.80, p = 0.005) after PBSCT. This correlation was better than the total dose of CD34+ cells at 6 (r = 0.31, p = 0.3) and 12 months (r = 0.48, p = 0.06) for the platelet counts. CD34+ subset analysis suggests that for early engraftment the total number of CD34+ cells infused is more strongly correlated than the CD34+ subsets, whereas the CD34+/CD38- and CD34+/CD90+ subsets may be associated with sustained long-term neutrophil and platelet engraftment. These findings may help to predict the repopulating capacity of PBSCs in AML patients after autologous PBSCT, especially when a relatively low number of CD34+ cells is infused.","['Specchia, Giorgina', 'Pastore, Domenico', 'Mestice, Anna', 'Liso, Arcangelo', 'Carluccio, Paola', 'Leo, Manuela', 'Casanova, Margherita', 'Sibilla, Silvia', 'Giannoccaro, Margherita', 'Liso, Vincenzo']","['Specchia G', 'Pastore D', 'Mestice A', 'Liso A', 'Carluccio P', 'Leo M', 'Casanova M', 'Sibilla S', 'Giannoccaro M', 'Liso V']","['Hematology Section, Department DAP, University of Bari, Bari, Italy. g.specchia@ematba.uniba.it']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Switzerland,Acta Haematol,Acta haematologica,0141053,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, CD34)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antigens, CD/analysis', 'Antigens, CD34', 'Blood Cell Count', 'Blood Platelets', 'Female', '*Graft Survival', 'Humans', 'Leukapheresis', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neutrophils', 'Peripheral Blood Stem Cell Transplantation/methods/*standards', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'Time Factors', 'Transplantation, Autologous']",,2006/11/23 09:00,2007/11/06 09:00,['2006/11/23 09:00'],"['2005/08/08 00:00 [received]', '2006/01/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2006/11/23 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/11/06 09:00 [medline]', '2006/11/23 09:00 [entrez]']","['95872 [pii]', '10.1159/000095872 [doi]']",ppublish,Acta Haematol. 2006;116(4):229-37. doi: 10.1159/000095872.,,,,,,"['Copyright 2006 S.

Since 1973, a series of toxicological and molecular epidemiological studies on benzene were conducted by researchers at the Chinese Academy of Preventive Medicine (CAPM) (1973-1986) and subsequently by a collaboration between the CAPM and the National Cancer Institute (NCI) in the United States that began in 1986, which was joined by investigators from the University of California at Berkeley, the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, and New York University. The findings demonstrated that the risk of leukemia and lymphoma among benzene-exposed workers was significantly increased, with elevated risks for leukemia present not only at higher exposure but also among workers exposed to under 10 ppm. Therefore, the benzene permissible level was decreased to 1.8 ppm (6 mg/m(3)) and benzene-induced leukemia is treated as an occupational cancer in China. The benzene permissible level is 1.0 in the United States and in several other developed countries and it has been suggested to be decreased to 0.5 ppm (ACGIH). A number of potential biomarkers are related to benzene exposure and poisoning. Some of these are benzene oxide-protein adducts, chromosome aberration of lymphocytes, and GPA mutations in erythrocytes, a decrease in B cell and CD4(-)T cell counts in peripheral blood, and altered expression of CXCL16, ZNF331, JUN, and PF4 in lymphocytes. Variation in multiple benzene metabolizing genes may be associated with risk of benzene hematotoxicity, including CYP2E1, MPO, NQO1, and GSTT1.","['Li, Guilan', 'Yin, Songnian']","['Li G', 'Yin S']","['Institute of Occupational Health and Poison Control, China CDC. guilanli@263.net.cn']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Ann N Y Acad Sci,Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences,7506858,['J64922108F (Benzene)'],IM,"['Benzene/*toxicity', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'China/epidemiology', 'Cohort Studies', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/chemically induced/epidemiology', 'Lymphoma/chemically induced/epidemiology', '*Molecular Epidemiology', 'Occupational Exposure', 'Polymorphism, Genetic']",,2006/11/23 09:00,2006/12/21 09:00,['2006/11/23 09:00'],"['2006/11/23 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/12/21 09:00 [medline]', '2006/11/23 09:00 [entrez]']","['1076/1/800 [pii]', '10.1196/annals.1371.035 [doi]']",ppublish,Ann N Y Acad Sci. 2006 Sep;1076:800-9. doi: 10.1196/annals.1371.035.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epidemiological studies, although sometimes contradictory, have linked phenoxy acid herbicides with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) and Soft Tissue Sarcoma (STS); organochlorine insecticides with STS, NHL, and leukemia; organophosphorous compounds with NHL and leukemia; and triazine herbicides with ovarian cancer. Exposure assessment is a crucial point in studying the association between cancer and pesticides. In order to investigate the association between hematolymphopoietic malignancies and occupational exposures, including pesticides, a population-based case-control study was carried out in Italy in 11 areas, 9 of which are agricultural or mixed areas. All newly diagnosed cases of hematolymphopoietic malignancies were collected in a 3-year period (1991-1993). The control group consisted of a random sample of the population residing in each area. The approach to infer exposures in agriculture was based on: the use of an agricultural questionnaire with 24 crop-specific questionnaires; expert agronomists who reviewed the collected information for each subject and translated it into pesticides histories. In total, 1925 cases and 1232 controls were interviewed in the nine agricultural areas. Increased risk was observed for some specific classes of pesticides. Furthermore, a nonstatistically significant increased risk of NHL was observed for subjects who were exposed to phenoxy herbicides not using protective equipment and a significant increased risk for exposure to 2, 4-dichlorophenoxy acetic acid (2,4-D).","['Miligi, Lucia', 'Costantini, Adele Seniori', 'Veraldi, Angela', 'Benvenuti, Alessandra', 'Vineis, Paolo']","['Miligi L', 'Costantini AS', 'Veraldi A', 'Benvenuti A', 'Vineis P']","['Environmental and Occupational Epidemiology Unit, Centre for Study and Prevention of Cancer, Istituto Toscano Tumori, 50135 Florence, Italy. l.miligi@cspo.it']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",,United States,Ann N Y Acad Sci,Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences,7506858,['0 (Pesticides)'],IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Female', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*chemically induced', 'Humans', 'Italy', 'Lymphoma/*chemically induced', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Pesticides/*toxicity']",29,2006/11/23 09:00,2006/12/21 09:00,['2006/11/23 09:00'],"['2006/11/23 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/12/21 09:00 [medline]', '2006/11/23 09:00 [entrez]']","['1076/1/366 [pii]', '10.1196/annals.1371.036 [doi]']",ppublish,Ann N Y Acad Sci. 2006 Sep;1076:366-77. doi: 10.1196/annals.1371.036.,,,,,,,,,['WILL'],,,,,,,,,,

It finds elevated childhood leukemia rates, but extending too far from the power lines to be straightforwardly compatible with the existing literature. This leads to an examination of alternative explanations: magnetic fields, other physical factors, such as corona ions, the characteristics of the areas power lines pass through, bias, and chance.

Both animal studies and human epidemiological studies have shown statistically significant increases of leukemia and other lymphohematopoietic cancers in workers exposed to benzene. The most common leukemia that has been associated with benzene exposure, also called benzene poisoning, is acute myelocytic leukemia (AML). A review of the epidemiological literature on workers exposed to benzene or benzene-containing solvents and products shows, without question, that this exposure is significantly related to other types of leukemia and lymphoma.

Cases of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (n = 31), multiple myeloma (n = 15), and leukemia (n = 33) were identified between 1981 and 1999. Cases were age-matched to five controls. Exposure was retrospectively estimated for each occupational history using an algorithm in a relational database. Benzene exposure measurements, supplied by Australian petroleum companies, were used to estimate exposure for specific tasks. The tasks carried out within the job, the products handled, and the technology used, were identified from interviews with contemporary colleagues. More than half of the subjects started work after 1965 and had an average exposure period of 20 years. Exposure was low, 85% of the cumulative exposure estimates were <10 ppm years. Matched analyses showed that non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and multiple myeloma were not associated with benzene exposure. Leukemia risk, however, was significantly increased for the subjects with greater than 16 ppm years cumulative exposure, odds ratio (OR) 51.9 (5.6-477) or with greater than 0.8 ppm intensity of highest exposed job. Cumulative exposures were similar to those found in comparable studies. The inclusion of occasional high exposures, for example, as a result of spillages, reduced the ORs, when the exposure was treated as either a continuous or a categorical variable.

However, constitutive NF-kappaB activation can promote continuous lymphocyte proliferation and survival and has recently been recognized as a critical pathogenetic factor in lymphoma. Various molecular events lead to deregulation of NF-kappaB signaling in Hodgkin disease and a variety of T- and B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphomas either up-stream or downstream of the central IkappaB kinase. These alterations are prerequisites for lymphoma cell cycling and blockage of apoptosis. This review provides an overview of the NF-kappaB pathway and discusses the mechanisms of NF-kappaB deregulation in distinct lymphoma entities with defined aberrant pathways: Hodgkin lymphoma (HL), diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma, primary effusion lymphoma (PEL), and adult T-cell lymphoma/leukemia (ATL). In addition, we summarize recent data that validates the NF-kappaB signaling pathway as an attractive therapeutic target in T- and B-cell malignancies.","['Jost, Philipp J', 'Ruland, Jurgen']","['Jost PJ', 'Ruland J']","['III Medizinische Klinik, Klinikum rechts der Isar, Technische Universitat Munchen, Munich, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Viral)']",IM,"['Hodgkin Disease/physiopathology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/physiopathology', 'Lymphocytes/physiology', 'Lymphoma/genetics/*physiopathology/therapy', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/physiopathology', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell, Marginal Zone/genetics/physiopathology', 'Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse/physiopathology', 'Models, Biological', 'NF-kappa B/*physiology', 'Oncogene Proteins, Viral/physiology', 'Prognosis', 'Signal Transduction/physiology', 'Translocation, Genetic']",96,2006/11/23 09:00,2007/06/01 09:00,['2006/11/23 09:00'],"['2006/11/23 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/06/01 09:00 [medline]', '2006/11/23 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)41765-3 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2006-07-025809 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2007 Apr 1;109(7):2700-7. doi: 10.1182/blood-2006-07-025809.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

BLyS receptors are expressed only on B cells and not present in other normal cells including normal T lymphocytes. Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is a B-cell disease and CLL lymphocytes express BLyS receptors. Gelonin, a type 1 ribosome-inactivating toxin, lacks cell membrane binding domain and hence is nontoxic to intact cells. We generated a construct of recombinant gelonin (rGel) fused to BLyS to specifically target quiescent B-CLL lymphocytes. The construct rGel/BLyS specifically binds and internalizes through BAFF-R into CD19(+) B-CLL lymphocytes and induces apoptosis at nanomolar concentrations. In contrast, rGel alone was not able to internalize into these leukemic lymphocytes. Mechanistically, the rGel/BLyS construct inhibits protein synthesis with an IC(50) of less than 3 nM compared with more than 5000 nM for rGel toxin alone. This rGel/BLyS-mediated decrease in protein synthesis was associated with a decline in short-lived proteins such as MCL-1 and XIAP, the 2 survival proteins in B-CLL. There was a strong relationship between a decrease in these proteins and the cleavage of PARP, a hallmark feature of apoptosis. Taken together, these data suggest that the rGel/BLyS fusion toxin may have potential therapeutic efficacy for B-CLL patients.","['Nimmanapalli, Ramadevi', 'Lyu, Mi-Ae', 'Du, Min', 'Keating, Michael J', 'Rosenblum, Michael G', 'Gandhi, Varsha']","['Nimmanapalli R', 'Lyu MA', 'Du M', 'Keating MJ', 'Rosenblum MG', 'Gandhi V']","['Department of Experimental Therapeutics, The University of Texas M.

In CD19+ B-CLL cells, the Bax/Bcl-2 ratio was lower than in the CD19+ normal counterpart (1.3 versus 3.51; P<.05), mainly due to a Bcl-2 over expression (17.65 versus 9.02; P<.001).

Leukemia cells from a patient with acute myelomonocytic leukemia were administered to form subcutaneous tumors in nude mice, which were maintained successively, although we failed to establish continuously growing cells from the original leukemia cell culture. In the cultures of cells from subcutaneous tumors, there were stroma cells that had originated from the nude mice and showed continuous growth. The leukemia cells showed continuous growth dependent on this stroma, and this cell line was named NAMO-2. Detection of FLT3/ITD by the reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and genomic PCR showed that NAMO-2 was homozygous for FLT3/ITD. Constitutive activation of FLT3 was detected by Western blotting, and the phosphorylation of Akt, MEK, and STAT5 was also observed. FLT3 kinase inhibitor AG1296 specifically inhibited cell growth.

Upon maturation, DCs have been shown to induce expression of several surface molecules and the up-regulation of cytokine production. We have previously shown that THP-1 cells, human acute monocytic leukemia cell line, can discriminate between allergens and irritants by measuring expression of surface markers, CD86 and CD54, following chemical exposure. At the same time, we have also reported that augmented expression of HLA and CD80, and production of IL-1beta were up-regulated in THP-1 cells when treated with an allergen, 2,4-dinitrochlorobenzene (DNCB). In the present study, we first evaluated whether THP-1 cells induced the phenotypic changes and the production of cytokines, which are observed in the process of DC maturation, when treated with two known allergens, DNCB and nickel sulfate (NiSO(4)), and one irritant (sodium lauryl sulfate (SLS)). Exposure to DNCB and NiSO(4) induced significant augmentation of CD40 and CD83 expression as well as CD86 and CD54. Also, TNF-alpha and IL-8 secretion were markedly induced by DNCB and NiSO(4) in a dose-dependent manner. In addition, DNCB and NiSO(4) augmented CD1a expression and production of IL-6, respectively. On the contrary, SLS did not change any of these markers. We then evaluated a series of chemicals, including six known allergens (e.g., hydroquinone (HQ)) and two non-allergens (e.g., methyl paraben (MP)), in order to investigate the potential increase of CD86, CD54, CD40, and CD83 expression on THP-1 cells, and production of TNF-alpha and IL-8. Indeed, all tested allergens, except eugenol (EU), caused significant increased changes in at least four of the analyzed six markers, while non-allergens did not induce any changes. EU significantly augmented CD86, CD54 and CD40 expression. These results revealed that the wide variety of responses to allergens in THP-1 cells may emulate allergen-induced maturation processes of DCs. It is suggested that THP-1 cells, which could develop several DC-like properties, are suitable for identifying sensitizing potential of chemicals.","['Miyazawa, Masaaki', 'Ito, Yuichi', 'Yoshida, Yukiko', 'Sakaguchi, Hitoshi', 'Suzuki, Hiroyuki']","['Miyazawa M', 'Ito Y', 'Yoshida Y', 'Sakaguchi H', 'Suzuki H']","['Safety and Microbial Control Research Center, Kao Corporation, 2606 Akabane, Ichikai-Maich, Haga-Gun Tochigi 321-3497, Japan. miyazawa.masaaki@kao.co.jp']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20061014,England,Toxicol In Vitro,Toxicology in vitro : an international journal published in association with BIBRA,8712158,"['0 (Allergens)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (CD40 Antigens)', '0 (CD83 antigen)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Dinitrochlorobenzene)', '0 (Immunoglobulins)', '0 (Irritants)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '368GB5141J (Sodium Dodecyl Sulfate)', '4FLT4T3WUN (nickel sulfate)', '7OV03QG267 (Nickel)']",IM,"['Allergens/*toxicity', 'Antigens, CD/metabolism', 'Biomarkers/metabolism', 'CD40 Antigens/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cytokines/*metabolism', 'Dinitrochlorobenzene/*toxicity', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulins/metabolism', 'Irritants/*toxicity', 'Langerhans Cells/drug effects/metabolism', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/metabolism', 'Monocytes/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Nickel/*toxicity', 'Phenotype', 'Sodium Dodecyl Sulfate/*toxicity']",,2006/11/23 09:00,2007/06/08 09:00,['2006/11/23 09:00'],"['2006/03/31 00:00 [received]', '2006/09/15 00:00 [revised]', '2006/10/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2006/11/23 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/06/08 09:00 [medline]', '2006/11/23 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0887-2333(06)00230-X [pii]', '10.1016/j.tiv.2006.10.005 [doi]']",ppublish,Toxicol In Vitro. 2007 Apr;21(3):428-37. doi: 10.1016/j.tiv.2006.10.005.

Because of previous primary tumor treatment, RIO protocols were different from others we used for non-RIO. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between 1983 and 1998, we treated 20 RIO patients, ages 4-36 years (mean 16 years), with chemotherapy (two cycles before surgery, three postoperatively). The first preoperative cycle consisted of high-dose Methotrexate (HDMTX)/Cisplatinum (CDP)/Adriamycin (ADM) and the second of HDMTX/CDP/Ifosfamide (IFO). The three postoperative treatments were performed with cycles of MTX/CDP; IFO was used as single agent per cycle repeated three times. RESULTS: Two patients received palliative treatment because their osteosarcoma remained unresectable after preoperative chemotherapy. The remaining 18 patients had surgery (7 amputations, 11 resections); histologic response to preoperative chemotherapy was good in 8 patients, poor in 10. At a mean follow-up of 11 years (range, 7-22 years), 9 patients remained continuously disease-free, 10 died from osteosarcoma and 1 died from a third neoplasm (myeloid acute leukemia). These results are not significantly different from those achieved in 754 patients with conventional osteosarcoma treated in the same period with protocols used for conventional treatment. However, this later group had an 18% 3-year event-free survival after treatment of relapse vs. 0% in the RIO group. CONCLUSION: Treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy RIO seem to have an outcome that is not significantly different from that of comparable patients with conventional primary high grade osteosarcoma (5-year event-free survival: 40% vs. 60%, p = NS; 5-year overall survival 40% vs. 67%, p < 0.01).","['Bacci, Gaetano', 'Longhi, Alessandra', 'Forni, Cristiana', 'Fabbri, Nicola', 'Briccoli, Antonio', 'Barbieri, Enza', 'Mercuri, Mario', 'Balladelli, Alba', 'Ferrari, Stefano', 'Picci, Piero']","['Bacci G', 'Longhi A', 'Forni C', 'Fabbri N', 'Briccoli A', 'Barbieri E', 'Mercuri M', 'Balladelli A', 'Ferrari S', 'Picci P']","['Sections of Chemotherapy, Istituti Ortopedici Rizzoli, Bologna, Italy. gaetano.bacci@ior.it']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20061121,United States,Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys,"International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics",7603616,"['Q20Q21Q62J (Cisplatin)', 'UM20QQM95Y (Ifosfamide)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Bone Neoplasms/*drug therapy/etiology/surgery', 'Chemotherapy, Adjuvant', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cisplatin/administration & dosage', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Ifosfamide/administration & dosage', 'Male', 'Methotrexate/administration & dosage', 'Neoadjuvant Therapy', 'Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced/*drug therapy/etiology/surgery', 'Osteosarcoma/*drug therapy/etiology/surgery', 'Retrospective Studies']",,2006/11/23 09:00,2007/02/27 09:00,['2006/11/23 09:00'],"['2006/06/07 00:00 [received]', '2006/08/31 00:00 [revised]', '2006/08/31 00:00 [accepted]', '2006/11/23 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/02/27 09:00 [medline]', '2006/11/23 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0360-3016(06)02961-0 [pii]', '10.1016/j.ijrobp.2006.08.072 [doi]']",ppublish,Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 2007 Feb 1;67(2):505-11. doi: 10.1016/j.ijrobp.2006.08.072.

In the present study, we genotyped 153 patients diagnosed with de novo acute myeloid leukemia (AML) to clarify the influence of the genetic polymorphisms CYP1A1*2A, CYP3A4*1B, CYP2E1*5B, del{GSTT1}, del{GSTM1}, and NQO1*2 on disease outcome. The del{GSTM1} showed a higher frequency in females (62%) than in males (41%) (P=0.01). The number of functional NQO1 alleles influenced the response to induction therapy; 81% (55/68) NQO1-negative patients, 69% (28/41) heterozygous patients, and 27% (2/7) homozygous patients achieved complete remission (CR) (P=0.04). The presence of GST deletions was associated with a lower probability of disease-free survival (DFS) and this effect was more relevant in male patients. Males with del{GSTM1} showed a 28% DFS versus 57% DFS for undeleted GSTM1 (P=0.04). Similarly, males with undeleted GSTM1 and GSTT1 showed a 64% DFS versus 34% DFS for males with at least one GST deletion (P=0.05). This study suggests that the NQO1*2 polymorphism is relevant to the patient's response to induction therapy and that GST deletions influence treatment outcome after chemotherapy, especially in male patients.","['Barragan, Eva', 'Collado, Maria', 'Cervera, Jose', 'Martin, Guillermo', 'Bolufer, Pascual', 'Roman, Jose', 'Sanz, Miguel A']","['Barragan E', 'Collado M', 'Cervera J', 'Martin G', 'Bolufer P', 'Roman J', 'Sanz MA']","['Molecular Biology Laboratory, (Dpt.

They are involved in a variety of cell-cell interactions and therefore play an important role during development and regeneration. UDP-N-acetylglucosamine 2-epimerase/N-acetylmannosamine kinase (GNE) is the key enzyme in the de novo synthesis of Sia and it is a regulator of cell surface sialylation. Inactivation of GNE in mice results in early embryonic lethality. Mutations in the GNE gene are of clinical relevance in hereditary inclusion body myopathy, but these mutations do not necessarily decrease the enzymatic activity of GNE.

Cells from the large colonies grow at a normal rate while cells from the small colonies grow slower than normal. The relative proportion of large and small colonies after mutagen treatment is associated with a mutagen's ability to induce point mutations and/or chromosomal mutations. The molecular distinction between large and small colony mutants, however, is not clear. RESULTS: To gain insights into the underlying mechanisms responsible for the mutant colony phenotype, microarray gene expression analysis was carried out on 4 small and 4 large colony Tk mutant samples. NCTR-fabricated long-oligonucleotide microarrays of 20,000 mouse genes were used in a two-color reference design experiment. The data were analyzed within ArrayTrack software that was developed at the NCTR. Principal component analysis and hierarchical clustering of the gene expression profiles showed that the samples were clearly separated into two groups based on their colony size phenotypes. The Welch T-test was used for determining significant changes in gene expression between the large and small colony groups and 90 genes whose expression was significantly altered were identified (p < 0.01; fold change > 1.5). Using Ingenuity Pathways Analysis (IPA), 50 out of the 90 significant genes were found in the IPA database and mapped to four networks associated with cell growth. Eleven percent of the 90 significant genes were located on chromosome 11 where the Tk gene resides while only 5.6% of the genes on the microarrays mapped to chromosome 11. All of the chromosome 11 significant genes were expressed at a higher level in the small colony mutants compared to the large colony mutants. Also, most of the significant genes located on chromosome 11 were disproportionally concentrated on the distal end of chromosome 11 where the Tk mutations occurred. CONCLUSION: The results indicate that microarray analysis can define cellular phenotypes and identify genes that are related to the colony size phenotypes. The findings suggest that genes in the DNA segment altered by the Tk mutations were significantly up-regulated in the small colony mutants, but not in the large colony mutants, leading to differential expression of a set of growth regulation genes that are related to cell apoptosis and other cellular functions related to the restriction of cell growth.","['Han, Tao', 'Wang, Jianyong', 'Tong, Weida', 'Moore, Martha M', 'Fuscoe, James C', 'Chen, Tao']","['Han T', 'Wang J', 'Tong W', 'Moore MM', 'Fuscoe JC', 'Chen T']","['Division of Genetic and Reproductive Toxicology, National Center for Toxicological Research, US FDA, Jefferson, AR, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20060906,England,BMC Bioinformatics,BMC bioinformatics,100965194,['EC 2.7.1.21 (Thymidine Kinase)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Chromosomes', 'Cluster Analysis', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Leukemia L5178/*genetics', 'Mice', '*Mutation', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis/*methods', 'Software', 'Thymidine Kinase/*analysis/genetics', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,2006/11/23 09:00,2010/03/27 06:00,['2006/11/23 09:00'],"['2006/11/23 09:00 [pubmed]', '2010/03/27 06:00 [medline]', '2006/11/23 09:00 [entrez]']","['1471-2105-7-S2-S9 [pii]', '10.1186/1471-2105-7-S2-S9 [doi]']",epublish,BMC Bioinformatics. 2006 Sep 6;7 Suppl 2:S9. doi: 10.1186/1471-2105-7-S2-S9.,,,,,PMC1683564,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Little is known, however, about how RhoGTPases affect HIV-1 virion production, which is dependent on the endosomal sorting pathway. We report that ectopic expression of citron kinase (citron-K), a RhoA effector, preferentially enhances HIV-1 virion production. Depletion of endogenous citron-K inhibits HIV-1 virion production. Citron-N, which lacks the kinase domain, also enhances HIV-1 virion production. The leucine zipper, Rho-binding and zinc finger domains of citron-N are necessary for the enhancement activity. Citron-K also enhances murine leukemia virion production and the HIV-1 late domain is not required for the citron-K-mediated enhancement. Ectopic expression of citron-K leads to the formation of cytoplasmic structures containing citron-K and HIV-1 Gag proteins. HIV-1 and citron-K cooperatively enhance acidic endosome and lysosome compartments. Finally, citron-K promotes exocytosis of microvesicles or exosomes that co-purify with HIV-1 virions. We conclude that citron-K enhances HIV-1 virion production by stimulating the endosomal compartments and exocytosis.","['Loomis, Rebecca J', 'Holmes, Derek A', 'Elms, Andrew', 'Solski, Patricia A', 'Der, Channing J', 'Su, Lishan']","['Loomis RJ', 'Holmes DA', 'Elms A', 'Solski PA', 'Der CJ', 'Su L']","['Curriculum in Genetics and Molecular Biology, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, CB 7295, Chapel Hill, NC 27599, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",,England,Traffic,"Traffic (Copenhagen, Denmark)",100939340,"['0 (Gene Products, gag)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (citron-kinase)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (rhoA GTP-Binding Protein)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Endosomes/metabolism', '*Exocytosis', 'Gene Deletion', 'Gene Products, gag/deficiency/genetics/metabolism', 'HIV-1/genetics/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins', 'Leucine Zippers', 'Lysosomes/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/genetics/*metabolism', 'Virion/*metabolism', 'Virus Replication', 'Zinc Fingers', 'rhoA GTP-Binding Protein/*metabolism']",,2006/11/23 09:00,2007/03/06 09:00,['2006/11/23 09:00'],"['2006/11/23 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/03/06 09:00 [medline]', '2006/11/23 09:00 [entrez]']","['TRA503 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1600-0854.2006.00503.x [doi]']",ppublish,Traffic. 2006 Dec;7(12):1643-53. doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0854.2006.00503.x.,,,,,PMC4420201,,"['R56 AI048407/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA092240/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'AI/GM 48407/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'CA92240/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AI048407/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States']",['NIHMS683639'],,,,,,,,,,,

There are also doubts regarding the authenticity of many lines. We have characterised a panel of ALL cell lines for growth and drug resistance and compared data with that published for primary patient specimens. In contrast to the convention that cell lines are highly proliferative, those established in our laboratory grow at rates similar to estimates of leukaemic cells in vivo (doubling time 53-442 h). Authenticity was confirmed by genetic fingerprinting, which also demonstrated the potential stability of long-term cultures. In vitro glucocorticoid resistance correlated well with that measured ex vivo, but all lines were significantly more sensitive to vincristine than primary specimens. Sensitivity to methotrexate was inversely correlated to that of glucocorticoids and L-asparaginase, indicating possible reciprocity in resistance mechanisms. A cell line identified as highly methotrexate resistant (IC50 > 8000-fold higher than other lines) was derived from a patient receiving escalating doses of the drug, indicating in vivo selection of resistance as a cause of relapse.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between March 2000 and January 2003, we prospectively investigated the outcome of 236 consecutive patients with standard-risk malignancy from 12 French centers. Fifty-five patients underwent alloSCT from an unrelated HLA-identical donor at the allelic level, whereas 181 patients received an alloSCT from an HLA-identical sibling. Diagnoses included acute leukemia (n = 175), chronic myeloid leukemia (n = 43), and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS; n = 18). All patients received unmodified marrow graft following myeloablative conditioning with cyclophosphamide and total-body irradiation. Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis consisted of cyclosporine and short-course methotrexate in all patients. RESULTS: In multivariable analysis, overall survival and transplantation-related mortality were adversely influenced by recipient cytomegalovirus (CMV) -positive serology, age of donor older than 37 years, and the occurrence of acute grade > or = II GVHD. Event-free survival rates were lower for patients with recipient CMV-positive serology. Acute grades II to IV GVHD rates were higher for patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). No factor was found to influence either relapse or acute grades III to IV GVHD. The effect of donor type was nonsignificant for all criteria. CONCLUSION: In patients with standard-risk malignancy, transplantation from unrelated HLA-allellically matched donors led to outcomes similar to those from HLA-identical sibling donors.","['Yakoub-Agha, Ibrahim', 'Mesnil, Florence', 'Kuentz, Mathieu', 'Boiron, Jean Michel', 'Ifrah, Norbert', 'Milpied, Noel', 'Chehata, Sami', 'Esperou, Helene', 'Vernant, Jean-Paul', 'Michallet, Mauricette', 'Buzyn, Agnes', 'Gratecos, Nicole', 'Cahn, Jean Yves', 'Bourhis, Jean Henri', 'Chir, Zina', 'Raffoux, Colette', 'Socie, Gerard', 'Golmard, Jean Louis', 'Jouet, Jean-Pierre']","['Yakoub-Agha I', 'Mesnil F', 'Kuentz M', 'Boiron JM', 'Ifrah N', 'Milpied N', 'Chehata S', 'Esperou H', 'Vernant JP', 'Michallet M', 'Buzyn A', 'Gratecos N', 'Cahn JY', 'Bourhis JH', 'Chir Z', 'Raffoux C', 'Socie G', 'Golmard JL', 'Jouet JP']","['Agence de la biomedecine, St Denis, France.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20061120,United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,,IM,"['Adult', 'Female', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*therapy', '*Histocompatibility Testing', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Prospective Studies', 'Siblings', '*Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Survival Analysis', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Treatment Outcome']",,2006/11/23 09:00,2007/01/09 09:00,['2006/11/23 09:00'],"['2006/11/23 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/01/09 09:00 [medline]', '2006/11/23 09:00 [entrez]']","['JCO.2006.08.0952 [pii]', '10.1200/JCO.2006.08.0952 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2006 Dec 20;24(36):5695-702. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2006.08.0952.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Newly diagnosed APL patients younger than age 60 years with a WBC count of less than 10,000/microL were randomly assigned to receive either ATRA combined with and followed by three daunorubicin (DNR) plus AraC courses and a 2-year maintenance regimen (AraC group) or the same treatment but without AraC (no AraC group). Patients older than age 60 years and patients with initial WBC count of more than 10,000/microL were not randomly assigned but received risk-adapted treatment, with higher dose of AraC and CNS prophylaxis in patients with WBC counts more than 10,000/microL. RESULTS: Overall, 328 (96.5%) of 340 patients achieved complete remission (CR). In the AraC and the no AraC groups, the CR rates were 99% and 94% (P = .12), the 2-year cumulative incidence of relapse (CIR) rates were 4.7% and 15.9% (P = .011), the event-free survival (EFS) rates were 93.3% and 77.2% (P = .0021), and survival rates were 97.9% and 89.6% (P = .0066), respectively. In patients younger than age 60 years with WBC counts more than 10,000/microL, the CR, 2-year CIR, EFS, and survival rates were 97.3%, 2.9%, 89%, and 91.9%, respectively. CONCLUSION: These results support a role for AraC in addition to ATRA and anthracyclines in the treatment of newly diagnosed APL, at least using DNR at the cumulative dose we used and with the consolidation and maintenance regimens we used.","['Ades, Lionel', 'Chevret, Sylvie', 'Raffoux, Emmanuel', 'de Botton, Stephane', 'Guerci, Agnes', 'Pigneux, Arnaud', 'Stoppa, Anne Marie', 'Lamy, Thierry', 'Rigal-Huguet, Francoise', 'Vekhoff, Anne', 'Meyer-Monard, Sandrine', 'Maloisel, Frederic', 'Deconinck, Eric', 'Ferrant, Augustin', 'Thomas, Xavier', 'Fegueux, Nathalie', 'Chomienne, Christine', 'Dombret, Herve', 'Degos, Laurent', 'Fenaux, Pierre']","['Ades L', 'Chevret S', 'Raffoux E', 'de Botton S', 'Guerci A', 'Pigneux A', 'Stoppa AM', 'Lamy T', 'Rigal-Huguet F', 'Vekhoff A', 'Meyer-Monard S', 'Maloisel F', 'Deconinck E', 'Ferrant A', 'Thomas X', 'Fegueux N', 'Chomienne C', 'Dombret H', 'Degos L', 'Fenaux P']","[""Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris, Hopital Avicenne, Service d'Hematologie Clinique, Paris 13 University, Bobigny, France.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20061120,United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/*therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Cytarabine/*therapeutic use', 'Daunorubicin/administration & dosage', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Remission Induction', 'Survival Analysis', 'Tretinoin/administration & dosage']",,2006/11/23 09:00,2007/01/09 09:00,['2006/11/23 09:00'],"['2006/11/23 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/01/09 09:00 [medline]', '2006/11/23 09:00 [entrez]']","['JCO.2006.08.1596 [pii]', '10.1200/JCO.2006.08.1596 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2006 Dec 20;24(36):5703-10. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2006.08.1596.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study was institutional ethics committee approved. Informed signed consent was obtained from each study participant. The requirement for informed consent for use of data from a reference database was waived. Eleven patients (seven women, four men; mean age, 53 years+/-4.40 [standard deviation]) with an initial diagnosis of AML were enrolled in the study and underwent T2*-weighted two-echo echo-planar MR imaging of the pelvis before and after intravenous injection of a clinically approved iron oxide blood-pool contrast agent. Six healthy control subjects (one woman, five men; mean age, 35 years+/-2.31) were examined with the same MR protocol. The iron oxide-induced change in R2* relaxation rate (DeltaR2*) was calculated, and the vascular volume fraction (VVF) of the BM was derived by dividing the DeltaR2* of the BM by the DeltaR2* of the muscle. Parametric DeltaR2* maps were calculated to visualize vessel distribution. Patients underwent BM biopsy for correlative determination of microvessel density (MVD) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Differences in DeltaR2*, VVF, VEGF, and MVD were compared by using the Wilcoxon rank sum test. RESULTS: DeltaR2* maps showed prominent areas of highly vascularized BM in the patients with AML, whereas the control subjects had moderately vascularized BM with homogeneous vessel distribution. Quantitative analysis revealed VVF values to be significantly higher in patients with AML than in control subjects: The mean VVF in the pelvis was 9.18%+/-1.54 for patients versus 3.91%+/-0.61 for control subjects (P=.010). In accordance with MR results, MVD (P=.009) and VEGF expression (P=.017) were significantly elevated in the AML group compared with values in the control group. CONCLUSION: Iron oxide-enhanced MR imaging enables assessment of BM angiogenesis in patients with AML.","['Matuszewski, Lars', 'Persigehl, Thorsten', 'Wall, Alexander', 'Meier, Norbert', 'Bieker, Ralf', 'Kooijman, Hendrik', 'Tombach, Bernd', 'Mesters, Rolf', 'Berdel, Wolfgang E', 'Heindel, Walter', 'Bremer, Christoph']","['Matuszewski L', 'Persigehl T', 'Wall A', 'Meier N', 'Bieker R', 'Kooijman H', 'Tombach B', 'Mesters R', 'Berdel WE', 'Heindel W', 'Bremer C']","['Department of Clinical Radiology, University of Muenster, Albert-Schweitzer-Str 33, D-48129 Munster, Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20061120,United States,Radiology,Radiology,0401260,"['0 (Contrast Media)', '0 (Ferric Compounds)', '1K09F3G675 (ferric oxide)']",IM,"['Bone Marrow Neoplasms/*blood supply/*diagnosis', 'Contrast Media', 'Drug Approval', 'Female', '*Ferric Compounds', 'Humans', 'Image Enhancement/*methods', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*diagnosis', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging/*methods', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neovascularization, Pathologic/*diagnosis', 'Pilot Projects', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Sensitivity and Specificity']",,2006/11/23 09:00,2007/02/07 09:00,['2006/11/23 09:00'],"['2006/11/23 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/02/07 09:00 [medline]', '2006/11/23 09:00 [entrez]']","['2421051355 [pii]', '10.1148/radiol.2421051355 [doi]']",ppublish,Radiology. 2007 Jan;242(1):217-24. doi: 10.1148/radiol.2421051355.

Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), a common biochemical marker for tumor burden and anaerobic glycolysis, is a poor prognostic factor for AML. Regulated by hypoxia-induced factor, both vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) are responsive to cancer-related angiogenesis. To study the roles of serum LDH, VEGF and bFGF in AML angiogenesis, we investigated bone marrow vascularity in untreated AML patients, and analyzed its relationship to serum LDH, VEGF and bFGF levels. METHODS: Eighteen (11 males, 7 females; mean age, 57.7 years) de novo, untreated AML patients were enrolled. Bone marrow vascularity was evaluated by staining bone marrow core biopsy tissue with endothelial cell marker CD31 or CD34. Serum LDH was determined with the Wroblewski-La Due method. Serum VEGF and bFGF were determined with enzyme-linked immunoassay. The relationship of LDH, VEGF and bFGF level to bone marrow vessel numbers was examined by linear regression. RESULTS: Log LDH significantly correlated to AML bone marrow vascularity (r = 0.61; p = 0.007). VEGF and bFGF concentrations did not correlate with AML angiogenesis. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that serum LDH, but not VEGF and bFGF concentrations, can be used as a simple parameter for predicting vessel formation in AML bone marrow.","['Teng, Chieh-Lin', 'Young, Ji-Hsiung', 'Hsu, Shih-Lan', 'Chou, Guan', 'Kuo, Ing-Tiau', 'Yu, Chen-Yuan', 'Hwang, Guang-Yuh']","['Teng CL', 'Young JH', 'Hsu SL', 'Chou G', 'Kuo IT', 'Yu CY', 'Hwang GY']","['Division of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, Taichung Veterans General Hospital, Taichung, Taiwan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Netherlands,J Chin Med Assoc,Journal of the Chinese Medical Association : JCMA,101174817,"['0 (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A)', '103107-01-3 (Fibroblast Growth Factor 2)', 'EC 1.1.1.27 (L-Lactate Dehydrogenase)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Bone Marrow/*blood supply', 'Female', 'Fibroblast Growth Factor 2/*blood', 'Humans', 'L-Lactate Dehydrogenase/*blood', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*blood', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A/*blood']",,2006/11/23 09:00,2006/12/23 09:00,['2006/11/23 09:00'],"['2006/11/23 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/12/23 09:00 [medline]', '2006/11/23 09:00 [entrez]']","['S1726-4901(09)70324-7 [pii]', '10.1016/S1726-4901(09)70324-7 [doi]']",ppublish,J Chin Med Assoc. 2006 Nov;69(11):534-7. doi: 10.1016/S1726-4901(09)70324-7.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, these methods may miss groups of genes which form differential co-expression patterns under different subsets of experimental conditions. Here we describe coXpress, an R package that allows researchers to identify groups of genes that are differentially co-expressed. RESULTS: We have developed coXpress as a means of identifying groups of genes that are differentially co-expressed. The utility of coXpress is demonstrated using two publicly available microarray datasets. Our software identifies several groups of genes that are highly correlated under one set of biologically related experiments, but which show little or no correlation in a second set of experiments. The software uses a re-sampling method to calculate a p-value for each group, and provides several methods for the visualisation of differentially co-expressed genes. CONCLUSION: coXpress can be used to find groups of genes that display differential co-expression patterns in microarray datasets.","['Watson, Michael']",['Watson M'],"['Informatics Group, Institute for Animal Health, Compton, Newbury, Berks RG20 7NN, UK. michael.watson@bbsrc.ac.uk']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20061120,England,BMC Bioinformatics,BMC bioinformatics,100965194,,IM,"['Algorithms', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Computational Biology/*methods', 'Gene Expression Profiling', '*Gene Expression Regulation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics', 'Models, Statistical', 'Multigene Family', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Pattern Recognition, Automated', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/metabolism', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA', 'Software']",,2006/11/23 09:00,2007/01/04 09:00,['2006/11/23 09:00'],"['2006/07/21 00:00 [received]', '2006/11/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2006/11/23 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/01/04 09:00 [medline]', '2006/11/23 09:00 [entrez]']","['1471-2105-7-509 [pii]', '10.1186/1471-2105-7-509 [doi]']",epublish,BMC Bioinformatics. 2006 Nov 20;7:509. doi: 10.1186/1471-2105-7-509.,,,,,PMC1660556,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Based on these observations, H2S has been proposed to be a synaptic modulator in the brain. Here we show that differentiated astrocytes acquire sensitivity to H2S that is diminished by their transformation into reactive astrocytes. Although sodium hydrosulfide hydrate (NaHS), a donor of H2S, did not increase the intracellular concentration of Ca2+ in progenitors, exposure of progenitors to leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), which induces differentiation into glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP)-positive astrocytes, greatly increased the sensitivity to NaHS. In contrast, epidermal growth factor (EGF), transforming growth factor-alpha (TGF-alpha), dibutyryl cyclic AMP (db cAMP) and interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta) induced the conversion to reactive astrocytes with diminished sensitivity to NaHS. This suppressive effect of EGF on the sensitivity to NaHS was inhibited by cycloheximide, indicating that de novo protein synthesis was required for the suppression of H2S sensitivity.","['Tsugane, Mamiko', 'Nagai, Yasuo', 'Kimura, Yuka', 'Oka, Jun-Ichiro', 'Kimura, Hideo']","['Tsugane M', 'Nagai Y', 'Kimura Y', 'Oka J', 'Kimura H']","['National Institute of Neuroscience, National Center of Neurology and Psychiatry, Kodaira, Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Antioxid Redox Signal,Antioxidants & redox signaling,100888899,"['0 (Glial Fibrillary Acidic Protein)', '0 (Interleukin-1beta)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Protein Synthesis Inhibitors)', '0 (Sulfides)', '0 (Transforming Growth Factor alpha)', '62229-50-9 (Epidermal Growth Factor)', '63X7MBT2LQ (Bucladesine)', 'FWU2KQ177W (sodium bisulfide)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)', 'YY9FVM7NSN (Hydrogen Sulfide)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Astrocytes/*drug effects/*pathology', 'Bucladesine/metabolism', 'Calcium/metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Epidermal Growth Factor/metabolism', 'Glial Fibrillary Acidic Protein/chemistry', 'Hydrogen Sulfide/*pharmacology', 'Interleukin-1beta/metabolism', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/metabolism', 'Protein Synthesis Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Rats', 'Rats, Sprague-Dawley', 'Sulfides/chemistry', 'Transforming Growth Factor alpha/metabolism']",,2006/11/23 09:00,2007/06/15 09:00,['2006/11/23 09:00'],"['2006/11/23 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/06/15 09:00 [medline]', '2006/11/23 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1089/ars.2007.9.257 [doi]'],ppublish,Antioxid Redox Signal. 2007 Feb;9(2):257-69. doi: 10.1089/ars.2007.9.257.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Darbepoetin alpha (DA) is an erythropoiesis-stimulating protein (ESP) that is more highly glycosylated and has a longer half-life relative to recombinant human erythropoietin (rHuEPO), thus, allowing less frequent administration, increased convenience, and better compliance. METHODS: This retrospective analysis included 81 patients with MDS who were enrolled at 9 Spanish centers and who received once-weekly, subcutaneous DA (75-300 microg) for 16 weeks. RESULTS: Fifty-five percent of all patients (38 of 69 evaluable patients) achieved responses; 30.4% of were major responses, and 24.6% were minor responses; 64.7% of rHuEPO-naive patients and 45.7% rHuEPO-treated patients responded; and 43.2% had received previous rHuEPO. Most responses (65.8%) occurred at or before Week 8. The median age at diagnosis was 70 years (range, 38-87 years), the median age at the initiation of DA treatment was 75 years (range, 39-91 years), and 56.8% of patients were women. The median time from last ESP dose to DA initiation was 16.8 weeks (range, 0.0-159.0 weeks; <1 week in 53.1% of patients). According to the French-American-British classification system (n = 81 patients), 39.5% had refractory anemia (RA), 46.9% had RA with ringed sideroblasts, 9.9% had RA with excess blasts (RAEB), 1.2% had RAEB in transformation, and 2.5% had chronic myelomonocytic leukemia. According to the International Prognostic Scoring System (n = 47 patients), 55.3% of patients were in the low-risk group, and 36.2% of patients were in the intermediate-1-risk group. The median baseline hemoglobin level was 8.9 g/dL (range, 8.4-9.1 g/dL). The Starting DA dose was 75 microg per week in 3.7% of patients, 150 microg per week in 65.4% of patients, and 300 microg per week in 29.6% of patients (the dose was increased in 18.5% of patients and reduced in 9.9% of patients; median time to dose adjustment, 8 weeks). Five patients received granulocyte colony-stimulating factors. No DA-related adverse reactions occurred. CONCLUSIONS: In the current study, 55% of evaluable patients with MDS safely achieved an erythroid response.","['Giraldo, Pilar', 'Nomdedeu, Benet', 'Loscertales, Javier', 'Requena, Carmen', 'de Paz, Raquel', 'Tormo, Mar', 'Navarro, Pilar', 'Benedit, Patricia', 'Gasquet, Jose Antonio']","['Giraldo P', 'Nomdedeu B', 'Loscertales J', 'Requena C', 'de Paz R', 'Tormo M', 'Navarro P', 'Benedit P', 'Gasquet JA']","['Haematology Services, University of Miguel Servet Hospital, Zaragoza, Spain. pgiraldo@salud.aragon.es']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,"['0 (Hematinics)', '11096-26-7 (Erythropoietin)', '15UQ94PT4P (Darbepoetin alfa)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Anemia/*drug therapy/etiology', 'Darbepoetin alfa', 'Erythropoietin/*analogs & derivatives/therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Hematinics/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*complications', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Spain']",,2006/11/23 09:00,2007/02/13 09:00,['2006/11/23 09:00'],"['2006/11/23 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/02/13 09:00 [medline]', '2006/11/23 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/cncr.22343 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 2006 Dec 15;107(12):2807-16. doi: 10.1002/cncr.22343.,,,,,,['Copyright 2006 American Cancer Society.'],,,['Aranesp in Myelodysplastic Syndromes (ARM) Study Group'],,,,,,,,,,

In the present study we investigated the release of IFNgamma and GM-CSF by circulating T cells in AML patients with chemotherapy-induced cytopenia. T cells were activated with anti-CD3 plus anti-CD28 in a whole-blood assay in the presence of their natural cytokine network. We examined 63 samples derived from 16 AML patients during 28 chemotherapy cycles. Activated T cells showed a broad cytokine release profile, but IFNgamma and GM-CSF levels showed a significant correlation and were generally higher than the other cytokine levels. Higher IFNgamma and GM-CSF responses were associated with a low CD4:CD8 ratio, older patient age and no ongoing chemotherapy indicating potential utility of T cell activation regimes for the older AML patient. The cytokine levels could be further increased by the novel protein kinase C agonist PEP005, which also induced significant production of IL2 and TNFalpha which could contribute to anti-tumor effects in AML patients. We conclude that remaining T cells after intensive AML therapy show a broad cytokine release profile including high and significantly correlated levels of potentially anti-leukemic IFNgamma and the AML growth factor GM-CSF. The final outcome of an AML-initiated T cell cytokine response will thus depend on the functional characteristics of the AML cells, in particular the relative expression of IFNgamma and GM-CSF receptors which differs between AML patients.","['Ersvaer, Elisabeth', 'Hampson, Peter', 'Hatfield, Kimberley', 'Ulvestad, Elling', 'Wendelbo, Oystein', 'Lord, Janet M', 'Gjertsen, Bjorn Tore', 'Bruserud, Oystein']","['Ersvaer E', 'Hampson P', 'Hatfield K', 'Ulvestad E', 'Wendelbo O', 'Lord JM', 'Gjertsen BT', 'Bruserud O']","['Section for Hematology, Institute of Medicine, The University of Bergen and Haukeland University Hospital, 5021 Bergen, Norway. elisabeth.ersvar@med.uib.no']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20061108,Germany,Cancer Immunol Immunother,"Cancer immunology, immunotherapy : CII",8605732,"['0 (3-ingenyl angelate)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Diterpenes)', '0 (Esters)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cytokines/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Diterpenes/*pharmacology', 'Esters/*pharmacology', 'Female', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Interferon-gamma/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/*immunology', 'Lymphocyte Activation/drug effects/*immunology', 'Lymphopenia/chemically induced', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Protein Kinase C/metabolism', 'T-Lymphocyte Subsets/drug effects/*immunology/metabolism', 'T-Lymphocytes/drug effects/*immunology/metabolism']",,2006/11/23 09:00,2007/06/06 09:00,['2006/11/23 09:00'],"['2006/08/09 00:00 [received]', '2006/09/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2006/11/23 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/06/06 09:00 [medline]', '2006/11/23 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s00262-006-0236-5 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Immunol Immunother. 2007 Jun;56(6):913-25. doi: 10.1007/s00262-006-0236-5.

Here, we demonstrate that BIM and PUMA, similar to truncated BID (tBID), directly activate BAX-BAK to release cytochrome c. Conversely, anti-apoptotic BCL-2-BCL-X(L)-MCL-1 sequesters these 'activator' BH3-only molecules into stable complexes, thus preventing the activation of BAX-BAK. Extensive mutagenesis of BAX-BAK indicates that their activity is not kept in check by BCL-2-BCL-X(L)-MCL-1. Anti-apoptotic BCL-2 members are differentially inactivated by the remaining 'inactivator' BH3-only molecules including BAD, NOXA, BMF, BIK/BLK and HRK/DP5. BAD displaces tBID, BIM or PUMA from BCL-2-BCL-X(L) to activate BAX-BAK, whereas NOXA specifically antagonizes MCL-1. Coexpression of BAD and NOXA killed wild-type but not Bax, Bak doubly deficient cells or Puma deficient cells with Bim knockdown, indicating that activator BH3-only molecules function downstream of inactivator BH3-only molecules to activate BAX-BAK.

In contrast, the translocation is seen in only 3% of adult ALL cases. Evidence suggests that the TEL-AML1 translocation occurs in utero in 1% of all newborn children at cell levels of 10 to 10. In this study, we explore the prevalence of TEL-AML1-positive cells in 2 cohorts of healthy blood donors by real-time and nested reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. Overall, TEL-AML1-positive cells were demonstrated in 10 of 2005 healthy donors, that is, a prevalence of 0.5% (95% confidence interval, 0.2-0.3%). The level of TEL-AML1-positive cells was estimated to 10 to 10. The observed prevalence of TEL-AML1-positive cells in healthy adults is of the same order of magnitude as the prevalence reported in healthy newborns, but the observed cell level of 10 to 10 is much lower. These data indicates that prenatal TEL-AML1 subclones does not persist throughout adult life at cell levels of 10 to 10.

The pathway involving the MAPK ERK5 mediates growth factor- and stress-induced intracellular signaling that controls proliferation or survival depending upon the cell context. In this study, we show that reducing ERK5 levels with a specific small hairpin RNA 5 (shERK5) reduced cell viability, sensitized cells to death receptor-induced apoptosis, and blocked the palliative effects of phorbol ester in anti-Fas Ab-treated cells. shERK5 decreased nuclear accumulation of the NF-kappaB p65 subunit, and conversely, ectopic activation of ERK5 led to constitutive nuclear localization of p65 and increased its ability to trans activate specific reporter genes. Finally, the T lymphoma cell line EL-4, upon expression of shERK5, proliferated in vitro, but failed to induce s.c. tumors in mice.

However, little is known about the transcriptional programs activated by NOTCH1. Using an integrative systems biology approach we show that NOTCH1 controls a feed-forward-loop transcriptional network that promotes cell growth. Inhibition of NOTCH1 signaling in T-ALL cells led to a reduction in cell size and elicited a gene expression signature dominated by down-regulated biosynthetic pathway genes. By integrating gene expression array and ChIP-on-chip data, we show that NOTCH1 directly activates multiple biosynthetic routes and induces c-MYC gene expression. Reverse engineering of regulatory networks from expression profiles showed that NOTCH1 and c-MYC govern two directly interconnected transcriptional programs containing common target genes that together regulate the growth of primary T-ALL cells.

The enzymes that remove N-terminal methionine are known as methionine aminopeptidases (MetAPs). Human MetAP2 has been shown to be required for the proliferation of endothelial cells and angiogenesis. The physiological function of MetAP1, however, has remained elusive. In this report we demonstrate that a family of inhibitors with a core structure of pyridine-2-carboxylic acid previously developed for the bacterial and yeast MetAP1 is also specific for human MetAP1 (HsMetAP1), as confirmed by both enzymatic assay and high-resolution x-ray crystallography. Treatment of tumor cell lines with the MetAP1-specific inhibitors led to an accumulation of cells in the G(2)/M phase, suggesting that HsMetAP1 may play an important role in G(2)/M phase transition. Overexpression of HsMetAP1, but not HsMetAP2, conferred resistance of cells to the inhibitors, and the inhibitors caused retention of N-terminal methionine of a known MetAP substrate, suggesting that HsMetAP1 is the cellular target for the inhibitors. In addition, when HsMetAP1 was knocked down by gene-specific siRNA, cells exhibited slower progression during G(2)/M phase, a phenotype similar to cells treated with MetAP1 inhibitors. Importantly, MetAP1 inhibitors were able to induce apoptosis of leukemia cell lines, presumably as a consequence of their interference with the G(2)/M phase checkpoint. Together, these results suggest that MetAP1 plays an important role in G(2)/M phase of the cell cycle and that it may serve as a promising target for the discovery and development of new anticancer agents.","['Hu, Xiaoyi', 'Addlagatta, Anthony', 'Lu, Jun', 'Matthews, Brian W', 'Liu, Jun O']","['Hu X', 'Addlagatta A', 'Lu J', 'Matthews BW', 'Liu JO']","['Department of Pharmacology and Molecular Sciences, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD 21205, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20061117,United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (Carboxylic Acids)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', 'EC 3.4.11.- (Aminopeptidases)', 'EC 3.4.11.- (METAP1 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.11.18 (methionine aminopeptidase 2)', 'EC 3.4.24.- (Metalloendopeptidases)', 'K8CXK5Q32L (pyrimidine)']",IM,"['Aminopeptidases/antagonists & inhibitors/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Carboxylic Acids/chemistry/pharmacology', '*Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Crystallography, X-Ray', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/chemistry/pharmacology', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Humans', 'Metalloendopeptidases/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Models, Molecular', 'Molecular Structure', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Pyrimidines/chemistry']",,2006/11/23 09:00,2007/01/20 09:00,['2006/11/23 09:00'],"['2006/11/23 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/01/20 09:00 [medline]', '2006/11/23 09:00 [entrez]']","['0608389103 [pii]', '10.1073/pnas.0608389103 [doi]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2006 Nov 28;103(48):18148-53. doi: 10.1073/pnas.0608389103.

In the present study, the effects of the novel inhibitor SKI-606 on various models of resistance to imatinib were studied. SKI-606 proved to be an active inhibitor of Bcr-Abl in several chronic myelogenous leukemia cell lines and transfectants, with IC(50) values in the low nanomolar range, 1 to 2 logs lower than those obtained with imatinib. Cells expressing activated forms of KIT or platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR), two additional targets of imatinib, were unaffected by SKI-606, whereas activity was found against PIM2. SKI-606 retained activity in cells where resistance to imatinib was caused by BCR-ABL gene amplification and in three of four Bcr-Abl point mutants tested. In vivo experiments confirmed SKI-606 activity in models where resistance was not caused by mutations as well as in cells carrying the Y253F, E255K, and D276G mutations. Modeling considerations attribute the superior activity of SKI-606 to its ability to bind a conformation of Bcr-Abl different from imatinib.","['Puttini, Miriam', 'Coluccia, Addolorata Maria Luce', 'Boschelli, Frank', 'Cleris, Loredana', 'Marchesi, Edoardo', 'Donella-Deana, Arianna', 'Ahmed, Shaheen', 'Redaelli, Sara', 'Piazza, Rocco', 'Magistroni, Vera', 'Andreoni, Federica', 'Scapozza, Leonardo', 'Formelli, Franca', 'Gambacorti-Passerini, Carlo']","['Puttini M', 'Coluccia AM', 'Boschelli F', 'Cleris L', 'Marchesi E', 'Donella-Deana A', 'Ahmed S', 'Redaelli S', 'Piazza R', 'Magistroni V', 'Andreoni F', 'Scapozza L', 'Formelli F', 'Gambacorti-Passerini C']","['Department of Clinical Medicine, S.

However, certain point mutations in the gamma-globin gene promoter are capable of maintaining expression of this gene during adult erythropoiesis, a condition called non-deletion hereditary persistence of fetal hemoglobin (HPFH). Among these, the British form of HPFH carrying a T-->C point mutation at position -198 of the Agamma-globin gene promoter results in 4-10% fetal hemoglobin in heterozygotes. In this study, we used nuclear extracts from murine erythroleukemia cells to purify a protein complex that binds the HPFH -198 gamma-globin gene promoter. Members of this protein complex were identified by mass spectrometry and include DNMT1, the transcriptional coactivator p52, the protein SNEV, and RAP74 (the largest subunit of the general transcription factor IIF). Sp1, which was previously considered responsible for HPFH -198 gamma-globin gene activation, was not identified. The potential role of these proteins in the reactivation and/or maintenance of gamma-globin gene expression in the adult transcriptional environment is discussed.","['Olave, Ivan A', 'Doneanu, Catalin', 'Fang, Xiangdong', 'Stamatoyannopoulos, George', 'Li, Qiliang']","['Olave IA', 'Doneanu C', 'Fang X', 'Stamatoyannopoulos G', 'Li Q']","['Department of Medicine, Division of Medical Genetics, University of Washington, Seattle 98195, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20061117,United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Nuclear Matrix-Associated Proteins)', '0 (Sp1 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Transcription Factors, TFII)', '9004-22-2 (Globins)', '9034-63-3 (Fetal Hemoglobin)', 'EC 2.1.1.37 (DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferase 1)', 'EC 2.1.1.37 (DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferases)', 'EC 2.1.1.37 (DNMT1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.1.1.37 (Dnmt1 protein, mouse)', 'EC 3.6.4.12 (transcription factor TFIIF)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Animals', 'Antibody Specificity', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Fractionation', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Chromatography, Affinity', 'DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferase 1', 'DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferases/immunology/isolation & purification/metabolism', 'Fetal Hemoglobin/*genetics', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental', 'Globins/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute', 'Mass Spectrometry', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Nuclear Matrix-Associated Proteins/immunology/isolation & purification/metabolism', 'Point Mutation', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/*physiology', 'Sp1 Transcription Factor/immunology/isolation & purification/metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/immunology/isolation & purification/*metabolism', 'Transcription Factors, TFII/immunology/isolation & purification/metabolism', 'Transcriptional Activation']",,2006/11/23 09:00,2007/03/08 09:00,['2006/11/23 09:00'],"['2006/11/23 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/03/08 09:00 [medline]', '2006/11/23 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0021-9258(20)73510-6 [pii]', '10.1074/jbc.M610404200 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2007 Jan 12;282(2):853-62. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M610404200.

We hypothesized that common genetic variations may contribute to the variability of high-dose methotrexate pharmacokinetics. METHODS: Polymorphisms in all 32 exons of the ABCC2 gene were analyzed in a reference group of 59 healthy white subjects by polymerase chain reaction, single-strand conformation polymorphism, and sequencing. Subsequently, we assessed the association of polymorphisms with the methotrexate plasma concentrations in 44 pediatric patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) (29 male and 15 female patients; mean age, 6.8+/-4.8 years). Patients received 4 cycles of 5000 mg/m2 body surface area according to the ALL-Berlin-Frankfurt-Muenster (BFM) 95 or ALL-BFM 2000 protocol. RESULTS: In the reference group we detected 8 frequent single-nucleotide polymorphisms. Five of these were in complete linkage disequilibrium. Overall, 5 new polymorphisms are described. The genotype distribution of the patient cohort was not significantly different from the reference collective. The mean plasma methotrexate area under the curve from 36 to 48 hours after the start of the infusion was significantly 2-fold higher in female patients carrying at least 1 -24T allele as compared with all other patients (14.2+/-12.8 h.micromol/L versus 6.9+/-4.2 h.micromol/L, P<.001). The risk to have 2 or more cycles necessitating an intensification of folinate rescue was 9-fold (95% confidence interval, 1.8- to 44-fold) in female patients carrying at least 1 T allele (P=.0067). CONCLUSION: The data suggest a hitherto unknown gender-specific impact of the -24C>T ABCC2 gene polymorphism on high-dose methotrexate pharmacokinetics. Whereas a nonfunctional MRP2 variant has been described in a patient with severe impairment of methotrexate excretion, our study is the first to suggest that a frequent ABCC2 polymorphism contributes to variability of methotrexate kinetics.","['Rau, Thomas', 'Erney, Birgit', 'Gores, Ralf', 'Eschenhagen, Thomas', 'Beck, Jorn', 'Langer, Thorsten']","['Rau T', 'Erney B', 'Gores R', 'Eschenhagen T', 'Beck J', 'Langer T']","[""Department of Clinical and Experimental Pharmacology and Toxicology, University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf, Hamburg, and Children's Hospital, Friedrich-Alexander University Erlangen-Nuremberg, Erlangen, Germany. t.rau@uke.uni-hamburg.de""]",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Clin Pharmacol Ther,Clinical pharmacology and therapeutics,0372741,"['0 (ABCC2 protein, human)', '0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Membrane Transport Proteins)', '0 (Multidrug Resistance-Associated Protein 2)', '0 (Multidrug Resistance-Associated Proteins)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/blood/pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use', 'Area Under Curve', 'Child', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Female', 'Gene Frequency', 'Germany', 'Half-Life', 'Haplotypes', 'Humans', 'Infusions, Intravenous', 'Male', 'Membrane Transport Proteins/*genetics', 'Metabolic Clearance Rate', 'Methotrexate/blood/*pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use', 'Multidrug Resistance-Associated Protein 2', 'Multidrug Resistance-Associated Proteins/*genetics', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction/methods', 'Polymorphism, Genetic/*genetics', 'Polymorphism, Single-Stranded Conformational', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/genetics', 'Regression Analysis', 'Sex Factors']",,2006/11/23 09:00,2007/01/11 09:00,['2006/11/23 09:00'],"['2005/12/29 00:00 [received]', '2006/08/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2006/11/23 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/01/11 09:00 [medline]', '2006/11/23 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0009-9236(06)00348-1 [pii]', '10.1016/j.clpt.2006.08.012 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Pharmacol Ther. 2006 Nov;80(5):468-76. doi: 10.1016/j.clpt.2006.08.012.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

P-gp expression is an adverse prognostic factor for treatment outcome in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and is more frequently observed in older patients. Single-nucleotide polymorphisms of the ABCB1 gene, C1236T, G2677T, and C3435T, have been associated with altered drug metabolism and treatment outcome. We prospectively determined these single-nucleotide polymorphisms in AML blasts in a cohort of patients aged 60 years or older with AML and evaluated their relevance with regard to P-gp function and expression, ABCB1 messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) expression, and clinical outcome. METHODS: We have analyzed purified bone marrow-derived leukemic blasts, obtained at diagnosis, in 150 patients who were treated within a multicenter, randomized, phase 3 trial of elderly patients with AML. The significance of the allelic ABCB1 variants of C1236T, G2677T, and C3435T was evaluated with respect to P-gp expression and function in leukemic blasts and ABCB1 mRNA expression levels, and these values were correlated with treatment outcome. RESULTS: P-gp function and expression in leukemic blasts and ABCB1 mRNA levels in patients with AML did not vary significantly among any of the allelic variants of ABCB1. None of these allelic variations predicted a difference in complete response rate and survival endpoints. CONCLUSIONS: In AML patients aged 60 years or older, allelic ABCB1 variations of C1236T, G2677T, or C3435T are not associated with altered P-gp function or with MDR1 expression at the transcriptional or translational level in leukemic blasts, and they do not significantly affect clinical prognosis.","['van der Holt, Bronno', 'Van den Heuvel-Eibrink, Marry M', 'Van Schaik, Ron H N', 'van der Heiden, Ilse P', 'Wiemer, Erik A C', 'Vossebeld, Paula J M', 'Lowenberg, Bob', 'Sonneveld, Pieter']","['van der Holt B', 'Van den Heuvel-Eibrink MM', 'Van Schaik RH', 'van der Heiden IP', 'Wiemer EA', 'Vossebeld PJ', 'Lowenberg B', 'Sonneveld P']","[""Department of Trials & Statistics-HOVON (Dutch-Belgian Hemato-Oncology Cooperative Group) Data Center, Erasmus MC-Daniel den Hoed Cancer Center and Sophia Children's Hospital, Rotterdam, The Netherlands. b.vanderholt@erasmusmc.nl""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Clin Pharmacol Ther,Clinical pharmacology and therapeutics,0372741,"['0 (ABCB1 protein, human)', '0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B)', '0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Organic Anion Transporters)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B', 'ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/genetics/metabolism', 'Acute Disease', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Alleles', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Clinical Trials, Phase III as Topic', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/genetics', 'Gene Frequency', 'Genotype', 'Haplotypes/genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*drug therapy/genetics/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multicenter Studies as Topic', 'Organic Anion Transporters/*genetics/metabolism', 'Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide/*genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Treatment Outcome']",,2006/11/23 09:00,2007/01/11 09:00,['2006/11/23 09:00'],"['2006/07/19 00:00 [received]', '2006/07/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2006/11/23 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/01/11 09:00 [medline]', '2006/11/23 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0009-9236(06)00299-2 [pii]', '10.1016/j.clpt.2006.07.005 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Pharmacol Ther. 2006 Nov;80(5):427-39. doi: 10.1016/j.clpt.2006.07.005.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

During ontogeny, Tal-1/SCL is required for hematopoietic cell generation, both in the yolk sac, where erythro-myeloid cells are first produced, then in the intra-embryonic compartment, where hematopoietic stem cells independently arise. We describe here the expression pattern of lyl-1 in mouse embryos from 7 to 14 days post coitus using in situ hybridization, as well as beta-Galactosidase (beta-Gal) expression in lyl-1-lacZ knock-in embryos, which express a C-terminally truncated Lyl-1 protein fused to the beta-Galactosidase (Lyl-1Delta/beta-Gal). In addition, we compare lyl-1 expression pattern with that of tal-1/scl. Similar to Tal-1/SCL, Lyl-1 mRNA expression occurs in the developing cardiovascular and hematopoietic systems. However, contrary to tal-1/scl, lyl-1 is not expressed in the developing nervous system. In lyl-1-lacZ knock-in heterozygous and homozygous embryos, beta-Gal expression completely correlates with Lyl-1 mRNA expression in the intra-embryonic compartment and is present: (1) in the developing hematopoietic system, precisely where hematopoietic stem cells emerge, and thereafter in the fetal liver; (2) in the developing vascular system; and (3) in the endocardium. In contrast, whereas Lyl-1 mRNA is expressed in yolk sac-derived endothelial and hematopoietic cells, Lyl-1Delta/beta-Gal is either absent or poorly expressed in these cell types, thus differing from Tal-1/SCL, which is highly expressed there at both mRNA and protein levels.","['Giroux, Sebastien', 'Kaushik, Anna-Lila', 'Capron, Claude', 'Jalil, Ali', 'Kelaidi, Charikleia', 'Sablitzky, Fred', 'Dumenil, Dominique', 'Albagli, Olivier', 'Godin, Isabelle']","['Giroux S', 'Kaushik AL', 'Capron C', 'Jalil A', 'Kelaidi C', 'Sablitzky F', 'Dumenil D', 'Albagli O', 'Godin I']","['INSERM U790, Institut Gustave Roussy-PR1, 39 Rue Camille Desmoulins, 94805 Villejuif, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20061011,Netherlands,Gene Expr Patterns,Gene expression patterns : GEP,101167473,"['0 (Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors)', '0 (Lyl1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1)', '0 (Tal1 protein, mouse)', 'EC 3.2.1.23 (beta-Galactosidase)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors/*genetics', 'Cardiovascular System/*embryology', 'Embryonic Development', 'Female', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental', 'Hematopoiesis/*genetics', 'Hematopoietic System/*embryology', 'In Situ Hybridization', 'Male', 'Mesoderm/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*genetics', 'Pregnancy', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*genetics', 'T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1', 'beta-Galactosidase/genetics']",,2006/11/23 09:00,2007/04/25 09:00,['2006/11/23 09:00'],"['2006/07/17 00:00 [received]', '2006/09/29 00:00 [revised]', '2006/10/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2006/11/23 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/04/25 09:00 [medline]', '2006/11/23 09:00 [entrez]']","['S1567-133X(06)00174-8 [pii]', '10.1016/j.modgep.2006.10.004 [doi]']",ppublish,Gene Expr Patterns. 2007 Jan;7(3):215-26. doi: 10.1016/j.modgep.2006.10.004.

Previous evidence has implicated neuropoietic cytokines and also cyclic AMP in regenerative conditioning. In experiments reported here, delivery through a lentivirus vector of ciliary neurotrophic factor to the appropriate dorsal root ganglion in rats was sufficient to mimic the conditioning effect of peripheral nerve injury on the regeneration of dorsal spinal nerve root axons. Regeneration in this experimental preparation was also stimulated by intraganglionic injection of dibutyryl cyclic AMP but the effects of ciliary neurotrophic factor and dibutyryl cyclic AMP were not additive. Dibutyryl cyclic AMP injection into the dorsal root ganglion induced mRNAs for two other neuropoietic cytokines, interleukin-6 and leukemia inhibitory factor and increased the accumulation of phosphorylated STAT3 in neuronal nuclei. The in vitro conditioning action of dibutyryl cyclic AMP was partially blocked by a pharmacological inhibitor of Janus kinase 2, a neuropoietic cytokine signaling molecule. We suggest that the beneficial actions of increased cyclic AMP activity on axonal regeneration of primary sensory neurons are mediated, at least in part, through the induction of neuropoietic cytokine synthesis within the dorsal root ganglion.","['Wu, Dongsheng', 'Zhang, Yi', 'Bo, Xuenong', 'Huang, Wenlong', 'Xiao, Fang', 'Zhang, Xinyu', 'Miao, Tizong', 'Magoulas, Charalambos', 'Subang, Maria C', 'Richardson, Peter M']","['Wu D', 'Zhang Y', 'Bo X', 'Huang W', 'Xiao F', 'Zhang X', 'Miao T', 'Magoulas C', 'Subang MC', 'Richardson PM']","[""Center for Neuroscience, Institute of Cell and Molecular Sciences, Barts and The London, Queen Mary's School of Medicine, University of London, 4 Newark Street, London E1 2AT, UK.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20061116,United States,Exp Neurol,Experimental neurology,0370712,"['0 (Ciliary Neurotrophic Factor)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Tyrphostins)', '0 (alpha-cyano-(3,4-dihydroxy)-N-benzylcinnamide)', '63X7MBT2LQ (Bucladesine)', 'E0399OZS9N (Cyclic AMP)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Jak2 protein, rat)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 2)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Axons/physiology', 'Bucladesine/pharmacology', 'Ciliary Neurotrophic Factor/genetics/pharmacology', 'Conditioning, Psychological/drug effects/*physiology', 'Cyclic AMP/*metabolism', 'Cytokines/*metabolism', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Ganglia, Spinal', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Gene Transfer Techniques', 'Genetic Vectors', 'Interleukin-6/genetics', 'Janus Kinase 2/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Lentivirus/genetics', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/genetics', 'Nerve Crush', 'Nerve Regeneration/genetics/*physiology', 'Neurons, Afferent/drug effects/metabolism/*physiology', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis', 'Rats', 'Rats, Sprague-Dawley', 'Recombinant Proteins/pharmacology', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Spinal Nerve Roots', 'Tyrphostins/pharmacology']",,2006/11/23 09:00,2007/05/11 09:00,['2006/11/23 09:00'],"['2006/06/02 00:00 [received]', '2006/09/26 00:00 [revised]', '2006/09/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2006/11/23 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/05/11 09:00 [medline]', '2006/11/23 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0014-4886(06)00555-3 [pii]', '10.1016/j.expneurol.2006.09.017 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Neurol. 2007 Mar;204(1):66-76. doi: 10.1016/j.expneurol.2006.09.017.

METHODS: The study was carried out in 49 children (aged 6 months to 17 years) who received high-dose methotrexate (3 g/m(2) per course) in long-term treatment. In an index group (37 individuals; 1236 methotrexate plasma concentrations), a population pharmacokinetic model was developed using a nonlinear mixed-effects model. The remaining patients' data (12 individuals; 278 methotrexate plasma concentrations) were used for model validation. Age, sex, total bodyweight (TBW), height, body surface area, lowest urine pH during infusion, serum creatinine, ALT, AST, folinic acid dose and length of rescue were analysed as possible covariates. The final predictive performance of the pharmacokinetic model was tested using standardised mean prediction errors. RESULTS: The final population pharmacokinetic model (two-compartmental) included only age and total bodyweight as influencing clearance (CL) and volume of distribution of central compartment (V(1)). For children aged < or =10 years: CL (L/h) = 0.287 . TBW(0.876); V(1) (L) = 0.465 . TBW, and for children aged >10 years: CL (L/h) = 0.149 . TBW; V(1) (L) = 0.437 . TBW. From the base to the final model, the inter-individual variabilities for CL and V(1) were significantly reduced in both age groups (30-50%). The coefficients of variation of the pharmacokinetic parameters were <30%, while residual and inter-occasional coefficients maintained values close to 40%. Validation of the proposed model revealed the suitability of the model. CONCLUSION: A methotrexate population pharmacokinetic model has been developed for ALL children. The proposed model could be used in Bayesian algorithms with a limited sampling strategy to estimate the systemic exposure of individual patients to methotrexate and adapt both folinic acid rescue and methotrexate dosing accordingly.","['Aumente, Dolores', 'Buelga, Dolores Santos', 'Lukas, John C', 'Gomez, Pedro', 'Torres, Antonio', 'Garcia, Maria Jose']","['Aumente D', 'Buelga DS', 'Lukas JC', 'Gomez P', 'Torres A', 'Garcia MJ']","['Department of Pharmacy, Reina Sofia University Hospital, Cordoba, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article']",,Switzerland,Clin Pharmacokinet,Clinical pharmacokinetics,7606849,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '12001-76-2 (Vitamin B Complex)', 'AYI8EX34EU (Creatinine)', 'EC 2.6.1.1 (Aspartate Aminotransferases)', 'EC 2.6.1.2 (Alanine Transaminase)', 'Q573I9DVLP (Leucovorin)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Age Factors', 'Alanine Transaminase/blood', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Aspartate Aminotransferases/blood', 'Bayes Theorem', 'Body Weight', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Creatinine/blood', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infusions, Intravenous', 'Leucovorin/administration & dosage', 'Male', 'Metabolic Clearance Rate', 'Methotrexate/administration & dosage/blood/*pharmacokinetics', '*Models, Biological', 'Monte Carlo Method', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Vitamin B Complex/administration & dosage']",,2006/11/23 09:00,2007/02/28 09:00,['2006/11/23 09:00'],"['2006/11/23 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/02/28 09:00 [medline]', '2006/11/23 09:00 [entrez]']","['45127 [pii]', '10.2165/00003088-200645120-00007 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Pharmacokinet. 2006;45(12):1227-38. doi: 10.2165/00003088-200645120-00007.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To the best of the authors' knowledge there is, however, no known such report attributed to chronic myeloid leukaemia, especially in Nigeria. Apart from presenting this as the first report, it is also to emphasize the need for early full blood count in persons presenting with otherwise non-haematological condition. METHOD: The case note of the patient and the available literature on the subject were used. RESULT: The 15-year-old girl who presented with a fifteen-month history of right hip joint pain and progressive abdominal swelling with weight loss for five months was found to have chronic myeloid leukaemia and avascular necrosis of the right femoral head. Her gait and walk improved remarkably within two weeks of commencing cytoreductive therapy. However, she still uses crutches due to the extensive bone damage from the prolonged impaired blood supply caused by chronic myeloid leukaemia before presentation. CONCLUSION: Osteonecrosis of the femoral head can complicate chronic myeloid leukaemia from hyperviscosity-induced leucostasis.

Our findings show that interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta) and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) are rapidly (<5 and 15 minutes, respectively) and transiently expressed in mice following contusion. At 30-45 minutes post SCI, IL-1beta and TNF-positive cells could already be seen over the entire spinal cord segment analyzed. Multilabeling analyses revealed that microglia and astrocytes were the two major sources of IL-1beta and TNF at these times, suggesting a role for these cytokines in gliosis. Results obtained from SCI mice previously transplanted with green fluorescent protein (GFP)-expressing hematopoietic stem cells confirmed that neural cells were responsible for the production of IL-1beta and TNF for time points preceding 3 hours. From 3 hours up to 24 hours, IL-1beta, TNF, IL-6, and leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) were strongly upregulated within and immediately around the contused area. Colocalization studies revealed that all populations of central nervous system resident cells, including neurons, synthesized cytokines between 3 and 24 hours post SCI. However, work done with SCI-GFP chimeric mice revealed that at least some infiltrating leukocytes were responsible for cytokine production from 12 hours on. By 2 days post-SCI, mRNA signal for all the above cytokines had nearly disappeared. Notably, we also observed another wave of expression for IL-1beta and TNF at 14 days. Overall, these results indicate that following SCI, all classes of neural cells initially contribute to the organization of inflammation, whereas recruited immune cells mostly contribute to its maintenance at later time points.","['Pineau, Isabelle', 'Lacroix, Steve']","['Pineau I', 'Lacroix S']","['Department of Anatomy & Physiology, Laval University, Ste-Foy, Quebec, Canada G1V 4G2.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,J Comp Neurol,The Journal of comparative neurology,0406041,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Interleukin-1beta)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '147336-22-9 (Green Fluorescent Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Differentiation/immunology', 'Chemotaxis, Leukocyte/immunology', 'Chimera', 'Cytokines/*genetics', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Female', 'Gliosis/*immunology/metabolism/physiopathology', 'Green Fluorescent Proteins', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology/immunology/metabolism', 'Interleukin-1beta/genetics', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/genetics', 'Macrophages/immunology/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Microglia/immunology/metabolism', 'Myelitis/*immunology/metabolism/physiopathology', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Spinal Cord Injuries/*immunology/metabolism/physiopathology', 'Time Factors', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/genetics', 'Wallerian Degeneration/immunology/metabolism/physiopathology']",,2006/11/18 09:00,2007/02/03 09:00,['2006/11/18 09:00'],"['2006/11/18 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/02/03 09:00 [medline]', '2006/11/18 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/cne.21149 [doi]'],ppublish,J Comp Neurol. 2007 Jan 10;500(2):267-85. doi: 10.1002/cne.21149.,,,,,,"['(c) 2006 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

However the mechanism underlying the function of fatty acids in the process of lymphocyte apoptosis is not fully understood. In this study we show that the appearance of adipocyte-type fatty acid binding protein (A-FABP) is induced upon administration of dexamethasone (DEX) in both in vivo and cultured lymphocytes, and its distinct nuclear localization occurs in close relation to the DEX-induced apoptosis process. In immunohistochemistry of mouse spleen, A-FABP-immunoreactivity starts to occur 3 h after DEX stimulation, and it massively localizes in the nucleus 8 h after the treatment, while no A-FABP-immunoreactivity is discerned in the lymphocytes of normal as well as 24 h post-injection spleen. In the murine T-cell leukemia CTLL-2 cells, A-FABP-immunoreactivity is also induced in both of the cytoplasm and nucleus when the apoptosis is induced by IL-2 retrieval together with DEX treatment, while in the presence of IL-2 A-FABP-immunoreactivity is confined to the cytoplasm with DEX treatment. On the other hand, A-FABP-immunoreactivity is not detected by IL-2 retrieval alone. The present findings altogether suggest that A-FABP and its ligands, fatty acids, play an important role in the process of apoptosis and the immune modulation induced by DEX.","['Abdelwahab, Soha Abdelkawi', 'Owada, Yuji', 'Kitanaka, Noriko', 'Adida, Anne', 'Sakagami, Hiroyuki', 'Ono, Masao', 'Watanabe, Makoto', 'Spener, Friedrich', 'Kondo, Hisatake']","['Abdelwahab SA', 'Owada Y', 'Kitanaka N', 'Adida A', 'Sakagami H', 'Ono M', 'Watanabe M', 'Spener F', 'Kondo H']","['Division of Histology, Department of Cell Biology, Graduate School of Medical Science, Tohoku University, Tohoku, Sendai, 980-8575, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Netherlands,Mol Cell Biochem,Molecular and cellular biochemistry,0364456,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (Fatty Acid-Binding Proteins)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)']",IM,"['Adipocytes/*metabolism', 'Animals', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'DNA Primers', 'Dexamethasone/*pharmacology', 'Fatty Acid-Binding Proteins/*metabolism', 'Lymphocytes/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL']",,2006/11/18 09:00,2007/08/01 09:00,['2006/11/18 09:00'],"['2006/11/18 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/08/01 09:00 [medline]', '2006/11/18 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s11010-005-9050-1 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Cell Biochem. 2007 May;299(1-2):99-107. doi: 10.1007/s11010-005-9050-1.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Therefore, MCL-1 has been suggested as a potential new therapeutic target. Systemic mastocytosis (SM) is a myeloid neoplasm involving mast cells (MCs) and their progenitors. In the present study, we examined the expression and functional role of MCL-1 in neoplastic MCs and sought to determine whether MCL-1 could serve as a target in SM. As assessed by RT-PCR and immunohistochemical examination, primary neoplastic MCs expressed MCL-1 mRNA and the MCL-1 protein in all SM patients examined. Moreover, MCL-1 was detectable in both subclones of the MC line HMC-1--HMC-1.1 cells, which lack the SM-related KIT mutation D816V, and HMC-1.2 cells, which carry KIT D816V. Exposure of HMC-1.1 cells or HMC-1.2 cells to MCL-1-specific antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) or MCL-1-specific siRNA resulted in reduced survival and increased apoptosis compared with untreated cells. Moreover, MCL-1 ASOs were found to cooperate with various tyrosine kinase inhibitors in producing growth inhibition in neoplastic MCs, with synergistic effects observed with PKC412, AMN107, and imatinib in HMC-1.1 cells and with PKC412 in HMC-1.2 cells. Together, these data show that MCL-1 is a novel survival factor and an attractive target in neoplastic MCs.","['Aichberger, Karl J', 'Mayerhofer, Matthias', 'Gleixner, Karoline V', 'Krauth, Maria-Theresa', 'Gruze, Alexander', 'Pickl, Winfried F', 'Wacheck, Volker', 'Selzer, Edgar', 'Mullauer, Leonhard', 'Agis, Hermine', 'Sillaber, Christian', 'Valent, Peter']","['Aichberger KJ', 'Mayerhofer M', 'Gleixner KV', 'Krauth MT', 'Gruze A', 'Pickl WF', 'Wacheck V', 'Selzer E', 'Mullauer L', 'Agis H', 'Sillaber C', 'Valent P']","['Department of Internal Medicine I, Division of Hematology and Hemostaseology, Medical University of Vienna, Austria.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Oligoribonucleotides, Antisense)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'F41401512X (nilotinib)', 'H88EPA0A3N (Staurosporine)', 'ID912S5VON (midostaurin)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage', 'Base Sequence', 'Benzamides', 'Cell Line', 'DNA Primers/genetics', 'Drug Synergism', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Male', 'Mast Cells/*drug effects/pathology', 'Mastocytosis, Systemic/*drug therapy/genetics/metabolism/pathology/*therapy', 'Middle Aged', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'Oligoribonucleotides, Antisense/administration & dosage/genetics/*pharmacology', 'Piperazines/administration & dosage', 'Protein Kinase C/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit/genetics/metabolism', 'Pyrimidines/administration & dosage', 'RNA, Small Interfering/genetics', 'Staurosporine/administration & dosage/*analogs & derivatives', 'Transfection']",,2006/11/18 09:00,2007/06/01 09:00,['2006/11/18 09:00'],"['2006/11/18 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/06/01 09:00 [medline]', '2006/11/18 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)41810-5 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2006-07-032714 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2007 Apr 1;109(7):3031-41. doi: 10.1182/blood-2006-07-032714.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Immunoblotting using proteins derived from lysates or culture supernatants of UT-7 cells revealed the presence of IgG Abs specific to an 80-kDa protein. Peptide mass fingerprinting identified this 80-kDa protein as moesin. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) using recombinant moesin showed high titers of antimoesin Abs in 25 (37%) of 67 patients with AA. Moesin was secreted from several myeloid leukemia cell lines other than UT-7, such as OUN-1 and K562, as an exosomal protein. The presence of antimoesin Abs was significantly correlated with the presence of PNH-type cells and antidiazepam-binding inhibitor-related protein-1 (DRS-1) Abs. Patients with AA that did not show any of these 3 markers tended to respond poorly to immunosuppressive therapy.

An in vivo baboon model was used to study the direct actions of human CG (hCG) on the endometrium, during the periimplantation period. Endometrial gene expression was analyzed using microarrays. The endometrial biopsies were taken from hCG-treated (n = 5) and control (n = 6) animals on d 10 after ovulation. Class comparison identified 61 genes whose transcript levels differed between control and hCG-treated samples (48 increased, 13 decreased in mean expression level more than 2.5-fold; P < 0.01). Real-time PCR of transcript abundance confirmed up-regulation of several of these, including SerpinA3, matrix metalloproteinase 7, leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), IL-6, and Complement 3 (P </= 0.05). Analysis of protein abundance in endometrial flushings showed increased LIF and IL-6 protein in uterine flushings from hCG-treated animals compared with controls. Complement C3 and Superoxide dismutase 2 that were also up-regulated, were further evaluated by immunocytochemistry. Complement C3 showed a marked increase in stromal staining in response to hCG, whereas and superoxide dismutase 2 localization was most markedly increased in the glandular epithelial cells. Expression of Soluble Frizzled Related Protein 4, the most highly down-regulated gene, was also validated by PCR. Our experiments have shown that hCG induces alterations in the endometrial expression of genes that regulate embryo attachment, extracellular matrix remodeling and the modulation of the immune response around the implanting blastocyst. Several of these genes, including LIF and gp130, have been shown to be essential for implantation in other species. This study provides strong evidence that the preimplantation embryo itself influences the development of the receptive endometrium via secreted paracrine signals.","['Sherwin, J R A', 'Sharkey, A M', 'Cameo, P', 'Mavrogianis, P M', 'Catalano, R D', 'Edassery, S', 'Fazleabas, A T']","['Sherwin JR', 'Sharkey AM', 'Cameo P', 'Mavrogianis PM', 'Catalano RD', 'Edassery S', 'Fazleabas AT']","[""HCLD, Professor of Physiology, Director, Center for Women's Health & Reproduction, Department of Obstetrics & Gynecology, University of Illinois, 820 South Wood Street, Chicago, Illinois 60612-7313, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20061116,United States,Endocrinology,Endocrinology,0375040,"['0 (Chorionic Gonadotropin)', '0 (Complement C3)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', 'EC 1.15.1.1 (Superoxide Dismutase)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Chorionic Gonadotropin/pharmacology/*physiology', 'Complement C3/metabolism', 'Computer Systems', 'Embryo Implantation/*physiology', 'Endometrium/*metabolism', 'Female', '*Gene Expression/drug effects', 'Gene Expression Regulation/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Interleukin-6/metabolism', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/metabolism', 'Papio/*metabolism', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/metabolism', 'Superoxide Dismutase/metabolism', 'Tissue Distribution', 'Up-Regulation', 'Uterus/metabolism']",,2006/11/18 09:00,2007/02/28 09:00,['2006/11/18 09:00'],"['2006/11/18 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/02/28 09:00 [medline]', '2006/11/18 09:00 [entrez]']","['en.2006-0832 [pii]', '10.1210/en.2006-0832 [doi]']",ppublish,Endocrinology. 2007 Feb;148(2):618-26. doi: 10.1210/en.2006-0832.

We investigated DNA methylation changes in cardiovascular atherosclerotic tissues and in-vitro vascular senescence in the promoter of estrogen receptor beta gene, which has essential roles in vascular function. Coronary atherosclerotic tissues showed higher methylation levels (28.7%) than normal appearing arterial (6.7%-10.1%) and venous tissues (18.2%). In comparing estrogen receptor beta methylation between plaque and non-plaque regions in ascending aorta, common carotid artery, and femoral artery of two patients, the plaque lesions showed consistently higher methylation levels than non-plaque regions. Passage-dependent increased estrogen receptor beta methylation was observed in three of six human aortic endothelial or smooth muscle cell lines cultured in-vitro to vascular senescence. Estrogen receptor beta expression in these vascular cell lines was significantly activated by DNA-methyltransferase inhibition. This activity was augmented by histone deacetylase inhibition. These findings provide evidence of epigenetic dysregulation of estrogen receptor beta in atherosclerosis and vascular aging. We suggest that focal epigenetic changes in estrogen receptor beta contribute to the development of atherosclerosis and vascular aging.","['Kim, Jei', 'Kim, Jee Yeon', 'Song, Kyu Sang', 'Lee, Young Ho', 'Seo, Joong Seok', 'Jelinek, Jaroslav', 'Goldschmidt-Clermont, Pascal J', 'Issa, Jean-Pierre J']","['Kim J', 'Kim JY', 'Song KS', 'Lee YH', 'Seo JS', 'Jelinek J', 'Goldschmidt-Clermont PJ', 'Issa JP']","['Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas M.

Inhibitors of mitochondrial complex I of the electron transport chain have been shown to induce apoptosis and exhibit antitumor activity. In an effort to find novel complex I inhibitors which exhibited anticancer activity in the NCI's tumor cell line screen, we examined organized tumor cytotoxicity screening data available as SOM (self-organized maps) (http://www.spheroid.ncifcrf.gov) at the developmental therapeutics program (DTP) of the National Cancer Institute (NCI). Our analysis focused on an SOM cluster comprised of compounds which included a number of known mitochondrial complex I (NADH:CoQ oxidoreductase) inhibitors. From these clusters 10 compounds whose mechanism of action was unknown were tested for inhibition of complex I activity in bovine heart sub-mitochondrial particles (SMP) resulting in the discovery that 5 of the 10 compounds demonstrated significant inhibition with IC50's in the nM range for three of the five. Examination of screening profiles of the five inhibitors toward the NCI's tumor cell lines revealed that they were cytotoxic to the leukemia subpanel (particularly K562 cells). Oxygen consumption experiments with permeabilized K562 cells revealed that the five most active compounds inhibited complex I activity in these cells in the same rank order and similar potency as determined with bovine heart SMP. Our findings thus fortify the appeal of mitochondrial complex I as a possible anticancer molecular target and provide a data mining strategy for selecting candidate inhibitors for further testing.","['Glover, Constance J', 'Rabow, Alfred A', 'Isgor, Yasemin G', 'Shoemaker, Robert H', 'Covell, David G']","['Glover CJ', 'Rabow AA', 'Isgor YG', 'Shoemaker RH', 'Covell DG']","['Developmental Therapeutics Program, National Cancer Institute at Frederick, Frederick, MD 21702, USA. cglover@mail.ncifcrf.gov']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20061013,England,Biochem Pharmacol,Biochemical pharmacology,0101032,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', 'EC 7.1.1.2 (Electron Transport Complex I)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Cattle', 'Cell Line, Tumor', '*Databases as Topic', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', '*Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Electron Transport Complex I/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Structure-Activity Relationship']",,2006/11/18 09:00,2007/02/28 09:00,['2006/11/18 09:00'],"['2006/04/20 00:00 [received]', '2006/10/05 00:00 [revised]', '2006/10/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2006/11/18 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/02/28 09:00 [medline]', '2006/11/18 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-2952(06)00625-3 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bcp.2006.10.005 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Pharmacol. 2007 Feb 1;73(3):331-40. doi: 10.1016/j.bcp.2006.10.005.

However, the specific mechanism by which resveratrol exerts its anticarcinogenic effect has yet to be elucidated. In the present study, the inhibitory effects of resveratrol on cell proliferation and apoptosis were evaluated in the human leukaemia cell line HL-60 and the human hepatoma derived cell line HepG2. We found that after a 2 h incubation period, resveratrol inhibited DNA synthesis in a concentration-dependent manner. The IC50 value was 15 microm in both HL-60 and HepG2 cells. When the time of treatment was extended, an increase in IC50 value was observed; for example, at 24 h the IC50 value was 30 microm for HL-60 cells and 60 microm for HepG2 cells. Flow cytometry revealed that cells accumulated in different phases of the cell cycle depending on the resveratrol concentration. Furthermore, an increase in nuclear size and granularity was observed in the G1 and S phases of HL-60 treated and HepG2-treated cells. Apoptosis was also stimulated by resveratrol in a concentration-dependent manner in HL-60 and HepG2 cells. In conclusion, resveratrol inhibits cell proliferation in a concentration- and time-dependent manner by interfering with different stages of the cell cycle. Furthermore, resveratrol treatment causes stimulation of apoptosis as well as an increase in nuclear size and granularity.","['Stervbo, U', 'Vang, O', 'Bonnesen, C']","['Stervbo U', 'Vang O', 'Bonnesen C']","['Department of Life Sciences and Chemistry, Roskilde University, Denmark.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,England,Cell Prolif,Cell proliferation,9105195,"['0 (Annexin A5)', '0 (Anticarcinogenic Agents)', '0 (Stilbenes)', '10028-17-8 (Tritium)', 'Q369O8926L (Resveratrol)', 'VC2W18DGKR (Thymidine)']",IM,"['Annexin A5/metabolism', 'Anticarcinogenic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Carcinoma, Hepatocellular/*pathology', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Nucleus Size/drug effects', 'DNA Fragmentation/drug effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Flow Cytometry', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*pathology', 'Liver Neoplasms/*pathology', 'Resveratrol', 'Stilbenes/*pharmacology', 'Thymidine/pharmacokinetics', 'Tritium']",,2006/11/18 09:00,2007/01/05 09:00,['2006/11/18 09:00'],"['2006/11/18 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/01/05 09:00 [medline]', '2006/11/18 09:00 [entrez]']","['CPR406 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1365-2184.2006.00406.x [doi]']",ppublish,Cell Prolif. 2006 Dec;39(6):479-93. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2184.2006.00406.x.,,,,,PMC6496894,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this investigation, we studied an imatinib-resistant cell line (K562-r) generated from the K562 cell line in which none of the previously described mechanisms of resistance had been detected. A threefold increase in the expression of the heat-shock protein 70 (Hsp70) was detected in these cells. This increase was not associated to heat-shock transcription factor-1 (HSF-1) overexpression or activation. RNA silencing of Hsp70 decreased dramatically its expression (90%), and was accompanied by a 34% reduction in cell viability. Overexpression of Hsp70 in the imatinib-sensitive K562 line induced resistance to imatinib as detected by a large reduction in cell death in the presence of 1 muM of imatinib. Hsp70 level was also increased in blast cells of CML patients resistant to imatinib, whereas the level remained low in responding patients. Taken together, the results demonstrate that overexpression of Hsp70 can lead to both in vitro and in vivo resistance to imatinib in CML cells. Moreover, the overexpression of Hsp70 detected in imatinib-resistant CML patients supports this mechanism and identifies potentially a marker and a therapeutic target of CML evolution.","['Pocaly, M', 'Lagarde, V', 'Etienne, G', 'Ribeil, J-A', 'Claverol, S', 'Bonneu, M', 'Moreau-Gaudry, F', 'Guyonnet-Duperat, V', 'Hermine, O', 'Melo, J V', 'Dupouy, M', 'Turcq, B', 'Mahon, F-X', 'Pasquet, J-M']","['Pocaly M', 'Lagarde V', 'Etienne G', 'Ribeil JA', 'Claverol S', 'Bonneu M', 'Moreau-Gaudry F', 'Guyonnet-Duperat V', 'Hermine O', 'Melo JV', 'Dupouy M', 'Turcq B', 'Mahon FX', 'Pasquet JM']","['E0217 INSERM, Universite Victor SEGALEN Bordeaux 2, Hematopoiese Leucemique et Cibles Therapeutiques, Bordeaux cedex, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20061116,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (HSP70 Heat-Shock Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Biomarkers, Tumor', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*genetics', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'HSP70 Heat-Shock Proteins/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/*genetics/metabolism', '*Up-Regulation']",,2006/11/17 09:00,2007/02/10 09:00,['2006/11/17 09:00'],"['2006/11/17 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/02/10 09:00 [medline]', '2006/11/17 09:00 [entrez]']","['2404463 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.leu.2404463 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2007 Jan;21(1):93-101. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2404463.

In a remarkably short period of time, especially considering that their mechanism of action remains largely undefined, HDAC inhibitors have realized both success and failure as therapeutics for cancer in clinical trials. Notably, the pleiotropic HDAC inhibitors, suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA) and depsipeptide, have shown efficacy in a wide range of cancers, in particular for cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL), and are progressing in phase II clinical studies. However, evidence is accumulating that specific HDAC enzymes are important with respect to clinical efficacy, calling the usefulness of the classical inhibitors into question. Class I enzymes are being heralded as the most clinically relevant, however, this is still controversial and much of the information is in the private domain. Nevertheless, the potential to alter the expression of a more focused, disease-related subset of genes and to limit adverse effects has prompted the development of isoform-specific HDAC inhibitors. Here, we consider the growing view that broad-spectrum HDAC inhibitors may be superseded by more specific compounds.","['Karagiannis, T C', 'El-Osta, A']","['Karagiannis TC', 'El-Osta A']","['Department of Molecular Radiation Biology, Trescowthick Research Laboratories, Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre, East Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20061116,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Clinical Trials, Phase II as Topic', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*pharmacology', '*Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma, T-Cell/drug therapy', 'Neoplasms/*drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Skin Neoplasms/drug therapy', 'Treatment Failure']",68,2006/11/17 09:00,2007/02/10 09:00,['2006/11/17 09:00'],"['2006/11/17 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/02/10 09:00 [medline]', '2006/11/17 09:00 [entrez]']","['2404464 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.leu.2404464 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2007 Jan;21(1):61-5. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2404464.

A woman's age, use of radiotherapy and alkylating chemotherapy, and the allogeneic type of transplant are associated with a higher rate of premature ovarian failure and worse residual ovarian function. Premature ovarian failure has serious systemic and psychological effects that may need treatment and should be managed by practitioners trained to treat this particular population of women. Ultrasonographic evidence of ovarian follicles is often associated with a future resumption of cycles, but there are no serum markers to predict the return of ovarian function in these patients. In our center, the rate of ovarian function recovery was 7% after allogeneic SCT and 25% after autologous SCT (P<0.05). There are no guidelines on how to manage premature ovarian failure induced by myeloablative treatments followed by SCT. Because of the likelihood of the need for long-lasting estrogen plus progestin therapy (EPT) and the increased risk of secondary neoplasia after SCT, the EPT should be as physiological as possible. In our experience, the cyclical sequential combination of estradiol (2 mg daily) plus dydrogesterone (10 mg for 14 d/mo) was associated with excellent compliance because of its simple administration and few adverse effects. Such a treatment led to a dramatic improvement in vasomotor, urogenital, and psychological symptoms related to estrogen deficiency. However, in the allogeneic transplantation setting, up to 25% of women may suffer from gynecological chronic graft-versus-host disease, which may become apparent as hematocolpometra after introduction of EPT. Thus, accurate pretreatment evaluation and frequent monitoring during treatment are required. Moreover, EPT absorption may be reduced in patients who received allotransplants and have gastrointestinal or skin chronic graft-versus-host disease.","['Tauchmanova, Libuse', 'Selleri, Carmine', 'De Rosa, Gennaro', 'Sammartino, Annalidia', 'Di Carlo, Costantino', 'Musella, Tittania', 'Martorelli, Carmen', 'Lombardi, Gaetano', 'Rotoli, Bruno', 'Nappi, Carmine', 'Colao, Annamaria']","['Tauchmanova L', 'Selleri C', 'De Rosa G', 'Sammartino A', 'Di Carlo C', 'Musella T', 'Martorelli C', 'Lombardi G', 'Rotoli B', 'Nappi C', 'Colao A']","['Department of Molecular and Clinical Endocrinology and Oncology, Federico II University of Naples, Italy. tauchman@unina.it']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,Menopause,"Menopause (New York, N.Y.)",9433353,"['4TI98Z838E (Estradiol)', '90I02KLE8K (Dydrogesterone)']",IM,"['Drug Therapy, Combination', 'Dydrogesterone/administration & dosage', 'Estradiol/administration & dosage', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/therapy', 'Primary Ovarian Insufficiency/etiology/*prevention & control', 'Stem Cell Transplantation/*adverse effects']",67,2006/11/17 09:00,2007/06/22 09:00,['2006/11/17 09:00'],"['2006/11/17 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/06/22 09:00 [medline]', '2006/11/17 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/01.gme.0000232032.84788.8c [doi]'],ppublish,Menopause. 2007 Mar-Apr;14(2):320-30. doi: 10.1097/01.gme.0000232032.84788.8c.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Treatment with exogenous growth factors can mitigate this limitation, suggesting that the brain environment is normally deficient in permissive cues and that it may be possible to stimulate the latent regenerative potential of endogenous progenitors with appropriate signals. We analyzed the effects of overexpressing the cytokine leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) on adult neurogenesis in the normal brain. We found that LIF reduces neurogenesis in the olfactory bulb and subventricular zone by acting directly on NSCs. LIF appears to promote NSC self-renewal, preventing the emergence of more differentiated cell types. This ultimately leads to an expansion of the NSC pool. Our results have implications for the development of therapeutic strategies for brain repair and suggest that LIF may be useful, in combination with other factors, in promoting regeneration in the adult brain.","['Bauer, Sylvian', 'Patterson, Paul H']","['Bauer S', 'Patterson PH']","['Biology Division, California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, California 91125, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,J Neurosci,The Journal of neuroscience : the official journal of the Society for Neuroscience,8102140,"['0 (Antimitotic Agents)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Nerve Growth Factors)', 'G34N38R2N1 (Bromodeoxyuridine)']",IM,"['Adenoviridae/genetics', 'Animals', 'Antimitotic Agents/pharmacology', 'Bromodeoxyuridine', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects/*physiology', 'Cell Proliferation/*drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Genetic Vectors/physiology', 'Injections, Intraventricular', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/genetics/pharmacology/*physiology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Nerve Growth Factors/pharmacology', 'Nerve Regeneration/drug effects/physiology', 'Neuroglia/cytology/drug effects/metabolism', 'Neuronal Plasticity/drug effects/physiology', 'Neurons/cytology/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Spheroids, Cellular', 'Stem Cells/cytology/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Telencephalon/cytology/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Transfection/methods']",,2006/11/17 09:00,2006/12/27 09:00,['2006/11/17 09:00'],"['2006/11/17 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/12/27 09:00 [medline]', '2006/11/17 09:00 [entrez]']","['26/46/12089 [pii]', '10.1523/JNEUROSCI.3047-06.2006 [doi]']",ppublish,J Neurosci. 2006 Nov 15;26(46):12089-99. doi: 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.3047-06.2006.,,,,,PMC6674883,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Cellular microparticles, submicron vesicles shed from the plasma membrane of various cells, are also associated with human pathology. In the present study, we investigated the putative relationships between the SDF-1/CXCR4 axis and microparticles in AML. We detected CXCR4-expressing microparticles (CXCR4(+) microparticles) in the peripheral blood and bone marrow plasma samples of normal donors and newly diagnosed adult AML patients. In samples from AML patients, levels of CXCR4(+) microparticles and total SDF-1 were elevated compared with normal individuals. The majority of CXCR4(+) microparticles in AML patients were CD45(+), whereas in normal individuals, they were mostly CD41(+). Importantly, we found a strong correlation between the levels of CXCR4(+) microparticle and WBC count in the peripheral blood and bone marrow plasma obtained from the AML patients. Of interest, levels of functional, noncleaved SDF-1 were reduced in these patients compared with normal individuals and also strongly correlated with the WBC count. Furthermore, our data indicate NH(2)-terminal truncation of the CXCR4 molecule in the microparticles of AML patients. However, such microparticles were capable of transferring the CXCR4 molecule to AML-derived HL-60 cells, enhancing their migration to SDF-1 in vitro and increasing their homing to the bone marrow of irradiated NOD/SCID/beta2m(null) mice. The CXCR4 antagonist AMD3100 reduced these effects. Our findings suggest that functional CXCR4(+) microparticles and SDF-1 are involved in the progression of AML.

The best-studied example is the Bcr-Abl fusion protein in chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML). Although the clinical success of the Abl kinase inhibitor imatinib against chronic-phase CML emphasizes the importance of developing therapeutic strategies aimed at this target, resistance to imatinib poses a major problem for the ultimate success of CML therapy by this agent. We hypothesized a sequential blockade strategy that is designed to decrease the expression of the Bcr-Abl protein, with the goal of complementing the action of imatinib on kinase activity. In this study, flavopiridol, an inhibitor of transcription, homoharringtonine (HHT), a protein synthesis inhibitor, and imatinib were used singly and in combination against the Bcr-Abl-positive human CML cell line K562. Flavopiridol alone inhibited phosphorylation of the RNA polymerase II COOH-terminal domain, specifically reduced RNA polymerase II-directed mRNA synthesis, and decreased the Bcr-Abl transcript levels. HHT inhibited protein synthesis and reduced the Bcr-Abl protein level. Imatinib directly inhibited the kinase activity of Bcr-Abl. The combinations of flavopiridol and HHT and flavopiridol and imatinib synergistically decreased clonogenicity as evaluated by the median-effect method. Greater synergy was observed when HHT and imatinib were given sequentially compared with simultaneous administration. Imatinib-resistant Ba/F3 cells that were transfected to express the E255K and T315I mutations of Bcr-Abl were not cross-resistant to flavopiridol and HHT.

Each cytokine tested exhibited differential signaling capability and manifested both shared and unique patterns of gene activation, emphasizing compositional differences in activator protein-1 transcription factor activity and expression. In particular, OSM strongly activated the c-Jun NH(2)-terminal kinase (JNK) serine/threonine kinase and downstream components, including activating transcription factor (ATF)/cyclic AMP-responsive element binding protein family member, ATF3. JNK/stress-activated protein kinase kinase inhibition abrogated cell morphogenesis induced by OSM, indicating an important role for this pathway in OSM specificity.

In vitro, c-suPAR or its derived chemotactic peptide (uPAR(84-95)) stimulated migration of human CD34(+) HSCs and inactivated CXCR4, the chemokine receptor primarily responsible for HSC retention in bone marrow.

In vitro colony assays confirmed that uPAR(84-95) mobilized hematopoietic progenitors, showing an absolute increase in circulating colony-forming cells. uPAR(84-95) mobilizing activity was comparable to that of G-CSF; however, neither synergistic nor additive effect was observed in combining the two molecules.

Moreover, since activated CD4+ T cells and cord blood lymphocytes that are susceptible to HTLV-1 infection expressed undetectable levels of surface GLUT1, these results indicate that GLUT1 and HSPGs are important for efficient cell-to-cell transmission of HTLV-1 but raise concerns on the role of GLUT1 as the HTLV-1 primary binding receptor.","['Takenouchi, Norihiro', 'Jones, Kathryn S', 'Lisinski, Ivonne', 'Fugo, Kazunori', 'Yao, Karen', 'Cushman, Samuel W', 'Ruscetti, Francis W', 'Jacobson, Steven']","['Takenouchi N', 'Jones KS', 'Lisinski I', 'Fugo K', 'Yao K', 'Cushman SW', 'Ruscetti FW', 'Jacobson S']","['Viral Immunology Section, Neuroimmunology Branch, National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, National Institutes of Health, 9000 Rockville Pike, Bethesda, MD 20982, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural']",20061115,United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Glucose Transporter Type 1)', '0 (Receptors, Virus)']",IM,"['Glucose Transporter Type 1/*metabolism', 'HTLV-I Infections/transmission', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*metabolism/pathogenicity', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/physiopathology/virology', 'Receptors, Virus/*metabolism', 'Virion/*physiology']",,2006/11/17 09:00,2007/07/07 09:00,['2006/11/17 09:00'],"['2006/11/17 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/07/07 09:00 [medline]', '2006/11/17 09:00 [entrez]']","['JVI.01522-06 [pii]', '10.1128/JVI.01522-06 [doi]']",ppublish,J Virol. 2007 Feb;81(3):1506-10. doi: 10.1128/JVI.01522-06.

It interacts with Gata1, Tal1, E2A and Lmo2 to form a transcription factor complex regulating late erythroid genes. We identify a number of novel Ldb1 interacting proteins in erythroleukaemic cells, in particular the repressor protein Eto-2 (and its family member Mtgr1), the cyclin-dependent kinase Cdk9, and the bridging factor Lmo4. MO-mediated knockdowns in zebrafish show these factors to be essential for definitive haematopoiesis. In accordance with the zebrafish results these factors are coexpressed in prehaematopoietic cells of the early mouse embryo, although we originally identified the complex in late erythroid cells. Based on the change in subcellullar localisation of Eto-2 we postulate that it plays a central role in the transition from the migration and expansion phase of the prehaematopoietic cells to the establishment of definitive haematopoietic stem cells.","['Meier, Natalia', 'Krpic, Sanja', 'Rodriguez, Patrick', 'Strouboulis, John', 'Monti, Maria', 'Krijgsveld, Jeroen', 'Gering, Martin', 'Patient, Roger', 'Hostert, Arnd', 'Grosveld, Frank']","['Meier N', 'Krpic S', 'Rodriguez P', 'Strouboulis J', 'Monti M', 'Krijgsveld J', 'Gering M', 'Patient R', 'Hostert A', 'Grosveld F']","['Department of Cell Biology and Genetics, Erasmus MC, PO Box 2040, 3000 CA, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20061115,England,Development,"Development (Cambridge, England)",8701744,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (Cbfa2t3 protein, mouse)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (LIM Domain Proteins)', '0 (Ldb1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Lmo4 protein, mouse)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (Tcf4 protein, zebrafish)', '0 (Transcription Factor 4)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Zebrafish Proteins)', '0 (ldb1a protein, zebrafish)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (Cdk9 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (Cdk9 protein, zebrafish)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 9)']",IM,"['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing', 'Animals', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Chromatin Immunoprecipitation', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 9/metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*metabolism', 'Embryo, Mammalian/*metabolism', '*Embryo, Nonmammalian', 'Erythroid Cells/cytology', 'Erythropoiesis/*genetics', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*metabolism', 'Homeodomain Proteins/metabolism', 'LIM Domain Proteins', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute', 'Mice', 'Nuclear Proteins/metabolism', 'Protein Binding', 'Repressor Proteins/metabolism', 'Transcription Factor 4', 'Transcription Factors/metabolism', 'Transfection', 'Zebrafish', 'Zebrafish Proteins/*metabolism']",,2006/11/17 09:00,2007/02/17 09:00,['2006/11/17 09:00'],"['2006/11/17 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/02/17 09:00 [medline]', '2006/11/17 09:00 [entrez]']","['dev.02656 [pii]', '10.1242/dev.02656 [doi]']",ppublish,Development. 2006 Dec;133(24):4913-23. doi: 10.1242/dev.02656.

The bacterial epsilon subunit increased RNA-dependent DNA synthesis fidelity by approximately threefold and was the only 3'-5' exonuclease tested that did not deleteriously affect RT-PCR yields. Further testing showed that RT-PCR mutant frequencies were reduced significantly by performing cDNA synthesis in the presence of epsilon subunit, followed by PCR with a high-fidelity proofreading DNA polymerase.

There is, however, relatively little information about the role played by serpins in the control of protease activity within these cells and in the pericellular region. The observation that mutations in the neutrophil elastase gene, which cause cyclic and severe congenital neutropenia, are associated with protease maldistribution gives some clue as to the potential importance of inhibitor proteins. To begin to address the role of protease/inhibitor balance in blood cells we used reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction to examine protease and serpin gene expression in mature peripheral blood cells, differentiating haemopoietic progenitors, leukaemic blasts and haemopoietic cell lines. The results demonstrate stage-specific expression of proteases together with widespread expression of intra- and extra-cellular serpins. The elastase inhibitors monocyte neutrophil elastase inhibitor (MNEI) and antitrypsin (AT) showed overlapping expression. MNEI is predominantly expressed in early haemopoietic progenitors while antitrypsin is mainly expressed in more mature myeloid precursors, peripheral blood granulocytes and mononuclear cells. Our results give an overall picture of serpin and protease gene expression and draws attention to the potential importance of elastase regulators at all stages of myelopoiesis.","['Missen, Melinda A', 'Haylock, David', 'Whitty, Genevieve', 'Medcalf, Robert L', 'Coughlin, Paul B']","['Missen MA', 'Haylock D', 'Whitty G', 'Medcalf RL', 'Coughlin PB']","['Australian Centre for Blood Diseases, Monash University, Burnet Tower, Commercial Road, Prahran, Victoria, Australia.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (Plasminogen Activator Inhibitor 2)', '0 (Serpins)', '0 (alpha 1-Antitrypsin)', 'EC 3.4.- (Peptide Hydrolases)']",IM,"['Bone Marrow Cells/metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Lineage', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Gene Expression', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/metabolism', 'Peptide Hydrolases/*genetics', 'Plasminogen Activator Inhibitor 2/genetics', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Serpins/*genetics', 'Time Factors', 'alpha 1-Antitrypsin/genetics']",,2006/11/17 09:00,2007/03/09 09:00,['2006/11/17 09:00'],"['2006/11/17 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/03/09 09:00 [medline]', '2006/11/17 09:00 [entrez]']","['BJH6360 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1365-2141.2006.06360.x [doi]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2006 Dec;135(5):715-24. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.2006.06360.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To improve the efficacy of molecular target therapy against angiogenic molecules in acute myeloid leukaemia (AML), we examined the dependency of AML cells on the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)/VEGF receptor type2 (VEGFR2) system by using VEGFR2 kinase inhibitor. Nineteen patient AML samples were cultured with or without VEGFR2 kinase inhibitor. All four t(8;21) viable AML cells showed significant reductions when treated with VEGFR2 kinase inhibitor, although VEGFR2 kinase inhibitor did not affect the cell proliferation of five t(15;17) AML samples. Other AML cases showed variable responses. VEGFR2 kinase inhibitor greatly suppressed the growth of Kasumi-1, a t(8;21) cell line in a dose-dependent manner through induction of apoptosis, but did not show any significant influence on NB4, a t(15;17) cell line. In addition, VEGFR2 kinase inhibitor potentiated the growth inhibitory effect of cytarabine in Kasumi-1. Finally, it was shown that the Akt phosphorylation was augmented by VEGF(165) in Kasumi-1, which was abrogated by VEGFR2 kinase inhibitor. NB4 showed undetectable Akt phosphorylation even with VEGF(165). These data demonstrated that t(8;21) AML cells are dependent on VEGF through VEGFR2, resulting in the phosphorylation of Akt.","['Imai, Norikazu', 'Shikami, Masato', 'Miwa, Hiroshi', 'Suganuma, Kazuto', 'Hiramatsu, Akihito', 'Watarai, Masaya', 'Satoh, Atsushi', 'Itoh, Masato', 'Imamura, Akira', 'Mihara, Hidetsugu', 'Nitta, Masakazu']","['Imai N', 'Shikami M', 'Miwa H', 'Suganuma K', 'Hiramatsu A', 'Watarai M', 'Satoh A', 'Itoh M', 'Imamura A', 'Mihara H', 'Nitta M']","['Division of Haematology, Department of Internal Medicine, Aichi Medical University School of Medicine, Nagakute, Aichi, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",,England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (3-((2,4-dimethyl-3-(ethoxycarbonyl)pyrrol-5-yl)methylidenyl)indolin-2-one)', '0 (Indoles)', '0 (Pyrroles)', '0 (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Receptor-2)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Blotting, Western/methods', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 15', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 17', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 21', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 8', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Indoles/*therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/drug therapy/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Phosphorylation', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/metabolism', 'Pyrroles/*therapeutic use', '*Translocation, Genetic', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Receptor-2/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism']",,2006/11/17 09:00,2007/03/09 09:00,['2006/11/17 09:00'],"['2006/11/17 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/03/09 09:00 [medline]', '2006/11/17 09:00 [entrez]']","['BJH6372 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1365-2141.2006.06372.x [doi]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2006 Dec;135(5):673-82. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.2006.06372.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Mouse fetal liver-derived cells (MFLCs) were prepared as adherent cells from mouse embryos on embryonic d (ED) 14, after which undifferentiated cES cells were co-cultured with MFLCs. The induction of cES cells along a hepatic lineage was examined in MFLC-assisted differentiation, spontaneous differentiation, and growth factors (GF) and chemicals-induced differentiations (GF-induced differentiation) using retinoic acid, leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), FGF2, FGF4, hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), oncostatin M (OSM), and dexamethasone. RESULTS: The mRNA expression of alpha-fetoprotein, albumin (ALB), alpha-1-antitrypsin, and hepatocyte nuclear factor 4alpha was observed earlier in the differentiating cES cells co-cultured with MFLCs, as compared to cES cells undergoing spontaneous differentiation and those subjected to GF-induced differentiation. The expression of cytochrome P450 7a1, a possible marker for embryonic endoderm-derived mature hepatocytes, was only observed in cES cells that had differentiated in a co-culture with MFLCs. Further, the disappearance of Oct3/4, a representative marker of an undifferentiated state, was noted in cells co-cultured with MFLCs, but not in those undergoing spontaneous or GF-induced differentiation. Immunocytochemical analysis revealed an increased ratio of ALB-immunopositive cells among cES cells co-cultured with MFLCs, while glycogen storage and urea synthesis were also demonstrated.

Identification of novel signaling molecules that influence cell survival has the potential to facilitate the development of new cancer therapies. The cell adhesion and signaling molecule, PECAM-1, is expressed in many hematopoietic and endothelial cell malignancies, and has previously been shown to suppress mitochondrial-dependent, Bax-mediated apoptosis. The ability of PECAM-1 to influence tumor cell survival following exposure to chemotherapeutic agents, however, is not known. Here we show that, when overexpressed in HEK293 and REN mesothelioma cells, PECAM-1 confers resistance to apoptosis induced by the DNA-damaging chemotherapeutic agent, etoposide. Surprisingly, PECAM-1-mediated cytoprotection was found to be largely independent of its ability to form a signaling complex with the protein-tyrosine phosphatase SHP-2, as virtually no tyrosine phosphorylation of, or SHP-2 association with, PECAM-1 could be detected after etoposide treatment. Furthermore, PECAM-1 retained its ability to protect against chemotherapy-induced apoptosis in cells with SHP-2 levels significantly reduced using SHP-2-specific siRNA, and in cells in which Erk1/2--a downstream effector of SHP-2--had been inhibited. Finally, to determine whether endogenous PECAM-1 confers resistance to chemotherapy-induced apoptosis in lymphoid malignancies and endothelial cells, we used a lentiviral vector to stably express PECAM-1-specific siRNA in the Jurkat leukemia cell line and human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). siRNA-expressing Jurkat cells with a 70% reduction of PECAM-1 expression were significantly more sensitive to chemotherapy-induced apoptosis. HUVECs with PECAM-1 expression reduced 75% were also markedly more sensitive to chemotherapy-induced cell death. Taken together, these data demonstrate that endogenous PECAM-1 expression on lymphoid cancers confers resistance to apoptosis, and that lowering PECAM-1 expression in lymphoid malignancies can render them more susceptible to chemotherapy-induced apoptosis. In addition, reducing PECAM-1 levels in the tumor endothelium may aid in low-dose, anti-angiogenic therapy.","['Bergom, Carmen', 'Goel, Reema', 'Paddock, Cathy', 'Gao, Cunji', 'Newman, Debra K', 'Matsuyama, Shigemi', 'Newman, Peter J']","['Bergom C', 'Goel R', 'Paddock C', 'Gao C', 'Newman DK', 'Matsuyama S', 'Newman PJ']","['Blood Research Institute, Blood Center of Wisconsin, and Department of Cell Biology, Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, Wisconsin 53201, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20061230,United States,Cancer Biol Ther,Cancer biology & therapy,101137842,"['0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Platelet Endothelial Cell Adhesion Molecule-1)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (PTPN11 protein, human)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 11)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases)']",IM,"['Apoptosis', 'Cell Adhesion', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cells, Cultured', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Endothelium, Vascular/physiology', 'Gene Deletion', 'Humans', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/genetics', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Mesothelioma', 'Platelet Endothelial Cell Adhesion Molecule-1/genetics/*physiology', 'Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 11', 'Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases/genetics', 'Recombinant Proteins/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Transfection', 'Umbilical Cord']",,2006/11/16 09:00,2007/05/26 09:00,['2006/11/16 09:00'],"['2006/11/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/05/26 09:00 [medline]', '2006/11/16 09:00 [entrez]']","['3467 [pii]', '10.4161/cbt.5.12.3467 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Biol Ther. 2006 Dec;5(12):1699-707. doi: 10.4161/cbt.5.12.3467.

SUMMARY: Diagnosis is suspected on the observation of an increased white blood cell count and is confirmed by the presence of the Philadelphia (Ph) chromosome. CML progresses through a series of three defined stages with survival times of 3-5 years if untreated. The chromosomal translocation creating the Ph chromosome creates the BCR-ABL fusion protein, which is the initiating factor for CML. BCR-ABL is a constitutively active tyrosine kinase, which transforms hematopoietic stem cells through dysregulation of proliferation, apoptosis, differentiation, and cell adhesion. The transformation process is then accelerated by the accumulation of additional translocations. This fusion protein has been used clinically as a therapeutic target and a sensitive marker for measuring residual disease. Techniques, such as cytogenetic analysis of chromosomes, allow for the visualization of the Ph chromosome and additional translocations and abnormalities. The more sensitive fluorescent in situ hybridization assay can directly visualize the bcr-abl translocation through merged fluorescent tags. Polymerase chain reaction, the most sensitive of the assays, can be used to detect minute amounts of bcr-abl mRNA and this has made it possible to monitor and detect minimal residual disease recurrence and disease progression, thus greatly enhancing patient care. CONCLUSION: A variety of monitoring techniques can be employed during CML therapy, providing degrees of quantifying disease burden or absence of disease.","['Sessions, Jolynn']",['Sessions J'],"['Hematology/Oncology, Emory University Hospital, Atlanta, GA 30322, USA. jolynn_sessions@emoryhealthcare.org']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",,England,Am J Health Syst Pharm,American journal of health-system pharmacy : AJHP : official journal of the American Society of Health-System Pharmacists,9503023,"['EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Bone Marrow Examination', 'Cytogenetic Analysis/*methods', 'Disease Progression', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/genetics', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/blood/*diagnosis/genetics', 'Monitoring, Physiologic/*methods', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction']",25,2006/11/16 09:00,2007/06/15 09:00,['2006/11/16 09:00'],"['2006/11/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/06/15 09:00 [medline]', '2006/11/16 09:00 [entrez]']","['63/23_Supplement_8/S5 [pii]', '10.2146/ajhp060524 [doi]']",ppublish,Am J Health Syst Pharm. 2006 Dec 1;63(23 Suppl 8):S5-9; quiz S21-2. doi: 10.2146/ajhp060524.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Mutations of the BCR-ABL kinase domain, a common mechanism of resistance to imatinib in CML, are discussed. SUMMARY: Several new targeted kinase inhibitors have reached clinical trials and have proved to be efficacious in halting the oncogenic activity of most BCR-ABL mutants. Dasatinib is 300 times more potent than imatinib at BCR-ABL inhibition, has few side effects, and inhibits the SRC family kinases. Nilotinib inhibits BCR-ABL at 20-50 times more potency than imatinib. Both agents were highly effective in treating chronic phase CML but were less effective at treating accelerated phase CML in early phase clinical trials. In addition to these specific kinase inhibitors, farnesyl transferase inhibitors are actively being investigated. Vaccination strategies are undergoing clinical investigation transitioning from animal models to human clinical trials.

SUMMARY: In the 1980s busulfan and hydroxyurea were the standards of care. These were subsequently replaced by interferon alpha (IFN alpha) based therapy. Currently, bone marrow transplant survival has improved, making this also a viable option. Five-year progression-free survival averaged above 70% for chemotherapeutic options. Transplant survival at 56 months was approximately 60%; however, these survivors were generally cured of disease. The recognition of the role for BCR-ABL in CML has led to the development of specific kinase inhibitors such as imatinib. Clinical trial evidence has demonstrated a clear superiority of imatinib over interferon plus cytarabine, making this the new standard of care in first-line treatment of CML. Resistance to imatinib has been observed, in addition to relapse. The data suggest that the probability of response may be estimated as early as six months after initiation of imatinib therapy. Although combinations of imatinib with IFN alpha show small improvements compared to imatinib therapy alone, the biggest improvements were seen when imatinib doses were doubled. Unfortunately, not all patients can tolerate this increase in dose. The most common mechanism for imatinib resistance is the presence of a mutated BCR-ABL kinase. Several of these mutants have been cloned and characterized. CONCLUSION: Molecular-targeted BCR-ABL kinase inhibitors, such as imatinib, are now first-line treatment for CML. Allogeneic stem cell transplant is still the only proven curable treatment for CML in patients with an appropriate donor. Next generation BCR-ABL kinase inhibitors hold promise for patients with mutated BCR-ABL kinase that confer resistance to imatinib.","['Frame, David']",['Frame D'],"['University of Michigan Hospital, Department of Pharmacy UHB2D301, Ann Arbor, MI 48109, USA. dframe@med.umich.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",,England,Am J Health Syst Pharm,American journal of health-system pharmacy : AJHP : official journal of the American Society of Health-System Pharmacists,9503023,"['0 (Interferon-alpha)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', 'X6Q56QN5QC (Hydroxyurea)']",IM,"['Drug Therapy/*methods/trends', 'Humans', 'Hydroxyurea/therapeutic use', 'Interferon-alpha/therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/diagnosis/*therapy', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/therapeutic use', 'Stem Cell Transplantation/*methods/trends', 'Survival Analysis']",25,2006/11/16 09:00,2007/06/15 09:00,['2006/11/16 09:00'],"['2006/11/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/06/15 09:00 [medline]', '2006/11/16 09:00 [entrez]']","['63/23_Supplement_8/S10 [pii]', '10.2146/ajhp060525 [doi]']",ppublish,Am J Health Syst Pharm. 2006 Dec 1;63(23 Suppl 8):S10-4; quiz S21-2. doi: 10.2146/ajhp060525.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We investigated the hypothesis that previously observed Bcl-2 family member overexpression suppresses wild-type p53 activity in AML. We demonstrate that wild-type p53 protein is expressed in primary leukemic blasts from patients with de novo AML using 2-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (2D-PAGE) and phospho-specific flow cytometry. We found that p53 was heterogeneously expressed and phosphorylated in AML patient samples and could accumulate following DNA damage. Overexpression of antiapoptosis protein Bcl-2 in AML cells was directly correlated with p53 expression and phosphorylation on serine residues 15, 46, and 392. Within those patients with the highest levels of Bcl-2 expression, we identified a mutation in FLT3 that duplicated phosphorylation site Y591. The presence of this mutation correlated with greater than normal Bcl-2 expression and with previously observed profiles of potentiated STAT and MAPK signaling. These results support the hypothesis that Flt3-mediated signaling in AML enables accumulation of Bcl-2 and maintains a downstream block to p53 pathway apoptosis. Bcl-2 inhibition might therefore improve the efficacy of existing AML therapies by inactivating this suppression of wild-type p53 activity.","['Irish, Jonathan M', 'Anensen, Nina', 'Hovland, Randi', 'Skavland, Jorn', 'Borresen-Dale, Anne-Lise', 'Bruserud, Oystein', 'Nolan, Garry P', 'Gjertsen, Bjorn T']","['Irish JM', 'Anensen N', 'Hovland R', 'Skavland J', 'Borresen-Dale AL', 'Bruserud O', 'Nolan GP', 'Gjertsen BT']","['Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Baxter Laboratory of Genetic Pharmacology, Stanford University, Stanford, CA 94035, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20061114,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Protein Isoforms)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '42HK56048U (Tyrosine)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)']",IM,"['Cells, Cultured', 'DNA Damage', 'Electrophoresis, Gel, Two-Dimensional', '*Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profiling', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Mutation/genetics', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Isoforms/genetics/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/genetics/*metabolism', 'Tyrosine/genetics/*metabolism', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/genetics/*metabolism']",,2006/11/16 09:00,2007/04/03 09:00,['2006/11/16 09:00'],"['2006/11/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/04/03 09:00 [medline]', '2006/11/16 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)41872-5 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2006-02-004234 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2007 Mar 15;109(6):2589-96. doi: 10.1182/blood-2006-02-004234.

However, these studies ignored the restriction of CDR3 length of TCR alpha chain and few of them attempted to reveal the mechanisms of the oligo-clonal expansion of T cells in the tumors. The primary aims of this study were twofold to: (i) analyze the CDR3 length of TCR alpha and beta chain in peripheral blood mononuclear cells of T-lineage acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL); and (ii) discover the relationship between the clonality of T cells and the process of TCR rearrangement in peripheral T cells. To this end, we investigated the TCR BV and TCR AV family spectratypes of two T-ALL patients and healthy controls using the immunoscope spectratyping technique. We found that the spectratypes exhibited a Gaussian distribution in healthy controls. However, the TCR repertoires of the two patients were highly restricted in the number of different TCR BV and TCR AV family members present. Furthermore, we found that the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) of two T-ALL patients had the recombination signal sequence (RSS) 5'- and 3'-breaks end in the TCR BD2 gene using a specialized ligation-mediated polymerase chain reaction, implying the ongoing recombination of the TCR beta gene. Analysis of the particular CDR3 length of TCR alpha/beta T cells might be helpful for further study of the individualized therapy of T-ALL.

Kinetic studies of sodium-dependent glutamine and alanine transport exhibited a single saturable high-affinity carrier with a Michaelis constant of 152 +/- 26 microm and 203 +/- 36 microm and a maximal transport velocity of 960 +/- 165 and 1096 +/- 208 nmol/10(9)cells/min, respectively. Glutamate uptake was less than one-tenth of glutamine and alanine, and linearly increased with glutamate concentration which was mediated by diffusion. 4-acetamido-4'-isothiocyanatostilbene-2,2'-disulfonic acid (SITS), known as anion channel blockers, inhibited the sodium-dependent glutamine and alanine transport by 40% at 10 microm. Cellular contents of these amino acids in MOLT4 cells revealed glutamate to be the highest among them despite low glutamate influx.

Based on these results, the high glutamate concentration in MOLT4 was speculated to be synthesized from transported glutamine by active glutaminase.","['Ochiai, H', 'Higa, K', 'Hishiyama, N', 'Hisamatsu, S', 'Fujise, H']","['Ochiai H', 'Higa K', 'Hishiyama N', 'Hisamatsu S', 'Fujise H']","['Research Institute of Biosciences, School of Veterinary Medicine, Azabu University, 1-17-71 Fuchinobe, Sagamihara, Kanagawa 229-8501, Japan. ochiaih@azabu-u.ac.jp']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,England,Clin Lab Haematol,Clinical and laboratory haematology,7907061,"['0 (Amino Acid Transport System ASC)', '0RH81L854J (Glutamine)', ""27816-59-7 (4-Acetamido-4'-isothiocyanatostilbene-2,2'-disulfonic Acid)"", 'EC 3.5.1.2 (Glutaminase)', 'OF5P57N2ZX (Alanine)']",IM,"[""4-Acetamido-4'-isothiocyanatostilbene-2,2'-disulfonic Acid/pharmacology"", 'Alanine/*metabolism', 'Amino Acid Transport System ASC/metabolism', 'Biological Transport/physiology', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes', 'Cell Line, Tumor/metabolism', 'Glutaminase/metabolism', 'Glutamine/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/enzymology/*metabolism']",,2006/11/16 09:00,2007/01/17 09:00,['2006/11/16 09:00'],"['2006/11/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/01/17 09:00 [medline]', '2006/11/16 09:00 [entrez]']","['CLH842 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1365-2257.2006.00842.x [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Lab Haematol. 2006 Dec;28(6):399-404. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2257.2006.00842.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The aim of this study was to evaluate the pattern of haematological diseases diagnosed by bone marrow examination in Yemen considering the limited diagnostic facilities. At the referral haematology centre in Yemen, between November 1999 and November 2005, 785 patients >14 years old were evaluated by bone marrow examination. Relevant investigations were performed when needed. A total of 627 patients had haematological disorders other than lymphoma, and their data were analysed. There were 273 females and 354 males. A total of 159 patients had Acute myeloid leukaemia, 75 had acute lymphocytic leukaemia, 87 had chronic myeloid leukaemia, 36 chronic lymphocytic leukaemia, eight had multiple myeloma, 13 myelodysplastic syndromes, seven myelofibrosis, seven polycythaemia vera, three primary thrombocythaemia, two hairy cell leukaemia, two metastases, 36 aplastic anaemia, 29 immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP), nine autoimmune haemolytic anaemia, three pernicious anaemia, 65 iron deficiency anaemia, 57 megaloblastic anaemia and malaria, 18 mixed deficiencies, and 11 patients had visceral leishmaniasis. Sex- and age-related distribution of the various disorders was also presented. In conclusion, the leukaemias were the most frequently encountered diagnosis followed by iron deficiency anaemia, megaloblastic anaemia and malaria, aplastic anaemia and ITP respectively. The other haematological disorders were less common.

We have developed a derivative of BIRT 377, an allosteric inhibitor of LFA-1, which may be chemically tagged without affecting binding. In this study, we modified this derivative, (R)-1-(4-aminobutyl)-5-(4-bromobenzyl)-3-(3,5-dichlorophenyl)-5-methylimidazolidi ne- 2,4-dione (butylamino-NorBIRT), and demonstrated its potential as a noninvasive imaging agent. METHODS: Specific binding of fluorescein-labeled butylamino-NorBIRT to both human and murine cells was demonstrated using equilibrium binding and dissociation techniques. A radiometal, lutetium-177 (Lu-177), was incorporated into the butylamino-NorBIRT through 1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane-N,N',N"",N'''- tetraacetic acid (DOTA) as a chelator. RESULTS: Equilibrium-binding experiments demonstrated that fluorescein- labeled butylamino-NorBIRT specifically binds human and murine LFA-1 with affinity constants of 135 and 186 nM, respectively. Dissociation kinetic experiments demonstrated an off-rate of 0.168/second(1) on murine cells, consistent with the observed affinity constant. Lutetium-177 was used for labeling, with > or =99.99% radiochemical purity and incorporation yield. This radiolabeled derivative exhibited high stability in fetal bovine serum (FBS) at 37 degrees C over 72 hours. (177)Lu-DOTA-butylamino-NorBIRT showed a binding affinity of 235 nM to human LFA-1 for equilibrium binding and competitive binding experiments. CONCLUSIONS: The radiolabeled DOTA-butylamino-NorBIRT may have potential as a noninvasive imaging or therapeutic agent in both human and mouse models.","['Poria, Rahul B', 'Norenberg, Jeffrey P', 'Anderson, Tamara L', 'Erion, Jack', 'Wagner, Carston R', 'Arterburn, Jeffrey B', 'Larson, Richard S']","['Poria RB', 'Norenberg JP', 'Anderson TL', 'Erion J', 'Wagner CR', 'Arterburn JB', 'Larson RS']","['Department of Radiology, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Cancer Biother Radiopharm,Cancer biotherapy & radiopharmaceuticals,9605408,"['0 (BIRT 377)', '0', '(DOTA-1-(4-aminobutyl)-5-(4-bromobenzyl)-3-(3,5-dichlorophenyl)-5-methylimidazoli', 'dine-2,4-dione)', '0 (Heterocyclic Compounds, 1-Ring)', '0 (Hydantoins)', '0 (Imidazolidines)', '0 (Lymphocyte Function-Associated Antigen-1)', '0 (Organometallic Compounds)', '0 (Radioisotopes)', '5H0DOZ21UJ (Lutetium)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Binding, Competitive', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Heterocyclic Compounds, 1-Ring/*chemistry/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Hydantoins/*chemistry/*metabolism', 'Imidazolidines/chemistry/metabolism', 'Isotope Labeling/methods', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia/*diagnostic imaging/metabolism', 'Lutetium/*chemistry/*metabolism', 'Lymphocyte Function-Associated Antigen-1/*metabolism', 'Lymphoma/*diagnostic imaging/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Molecular Structure', 'Organometallic Compounds/chemistry/metabolism', 'Radioisotopes/*chemistry/*metabolism', 'Radionuclide Imaging']",,2006/11/16 09:00,2007/03/21 09:00,['2006/11/16 09:00'],"['2006/11/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/03/21 09:00 [medline]', '2006/11/16 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1089/cbr.2006.21.418 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Biother Radiopharm. 2006 Oct;21(5):418-26. doi: 10.1089/cbr.2006.21.418.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The additional expression of p27(kip-1) in the transformed cell clone partially reversed the malignant phenotype. Because several proteins associated with lipid rafts are involved in signal transduction and because changes of lipid raft composition are linked to the pathogenesis of leukemias, raft-associated proteins in DO64 cells and the deduced transformed cell clones were compared using a proteomic approach. Raft-associated proteins were separated by two-dimensional electrophoresis and identified by MALDI-TOF-MS. Here we show that the stem cell line DO64 and the deduced cell clones can clearly be distinguished by differences in the expression of a number of raft-associated proteins, namely caveolin-1, flotillin- 1, vimentin, galectin-3, and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. All identified proteins play an important role in cellular functions and may therefore participate in raft-mediated leukemic transformation. Therefore, our study suggests that the analysis of lipid raft protein composition may be useful for the identification of molecular markers of the transformation process.","['Osterhues, Anja', 'Liebmann, Sibylle', 'Schmid, Monika', 'Buk, Deborah', 'Huss, Ralf', 'Graeve, Lutz', 'Zeindl-Eberhart, Evelyn']","['Osterhues A', 'Liebmann S', 'Schmid M', 'Buk D', 'Huss R', 'Graeve L', 'Zeindl-Eberhart E']","['Institute of Pathology, Ludwig-Maximilians-University of Munich, 80337 Munich, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",,United States,Stem Cells Dev,Stem cells and development,101197107,"['0 (Caveolin 1)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Proteome)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Caveolin 1/metabolism', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'Dogs', 'Electrophoresis, Gel, Two-Dimensional', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*metabolism/*pathology', 'Membrane Microdomains/*chemistry', 'Membrane Proteins/*analysis/chemistry', 'Mice', 'Proteome', 'Stem Cells/*cytology/*metabolism']",,2006/11/16 09:00,2007/01/25 09:00,['2006/11/16 09:00'],"['2006/11/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/01/25 09:00 [medline]', '2006/11/16 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1089/scd.2006.15.677 [doi]'],ppublish,Stem Cells Dev. 2006 Oct;15(5):677-86. doi: 10.1089/scd.2006.15.677.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The signaling pathways required for self-renewal of these cells are yet to be defined. Previously we identified a stem cell-specific isoform of the protein SH2 domain-containing 5'-inositol phosphatase (SHIP) that we call s-SHIP, which is expressed in both pluripotent ES cells and adult tissue-specific multipotent cells, such as hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). s-SHIP lacks an SH2 domain but contains a 5'-inositol phosphatase domain and several protein-protein interaction domains that potentially enable its participation in many different signaling pathways. Here we show that s-SHIP associates with gp130, which forms a heterodimeric complex with the leukemia inhibitory factor receptor (LIFR). Signaling through LIFR and other receptors that heterodimerize with gp130 is critical for growth and survival of ES cells and HSCs.

This echinocandin has demonstrated efficacy (45% success) as salvage monotherapy of invasive aspergillosis (IA). Interest remains as to whether caspofungin, in combination with other antifungal classes, can improve the efficacy against IA. METHODS: The study involved 53 adults with documented IA who were refractory to or intolerant of standard antifungal therapy and received caspofungin and 1 other mold-active antifungal agent (at the investigator's discretion). Efficacy was assessed by signs, symptoms, and radiographs at the end of combination therapy and Day 84 after combination therapy initiation. Favorable (complete or partial) responses required significant clinical and radiographic improvement. Diagnoses and outcomes were assessed by an independent expert. RESULTS: Among the 53 patients enrolled the most common underlying diseases were acute leukemia (53%), lymphoma (11%), and chronic leukemia (6%). Pulmonary aspergillosis (81%) was the most common site, and most patients (87%) were refractory to prior therapy. Success at the end of combination therapy and Day 84 was 55% (29/53) and 49% (25/51), respectively. Fifty-seven percent of patients with neutropenia and 54% who received an allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant responded favorably. Survival at Day 84 was 55%. Combination therapy, dosed on average for 31.3 days, was well tolerated. Two (4%) serious drug-related adverse events, both attributed to voriconazole, occurred.

Incidence and mortality rates from cancer have been decreasing by around 1 % per year since the mid-nineties of the past century in the European Union. However, the spectrum of malignant diseases and the outcome is not equally distributed between the two sexes. Startlingly, in advanced cancers, women receiving the same treatment schemes as men fare better. Until recently, however, the pharmacological knowledge of the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic action of cytotoxic drugs was scarce for women, as like in other fields of medicine, studies recruited far more men than women and because results were often not reported separately for both sexes. These practices are slowly changing and gender specific outcome data are progressively accumulating. Such data on gender-specific differences or similarities are essential for building newer, more adequate tools for dosing drugs than the current form based on a ""falsely accurate and individualzed"" estimation of the body surface area. Nevertheless, the socioeconomical and sociocultural context of living remains genderspecifically different, influencing the coping of individuals with a life-threatening disease.

Data including surgical approach (laparoscopic vs. hand-assisted), operative time, conversion rate, estimated blood loss, splenic weight, length of stay, time to tolerate a diet, pathologic diagnosis, complications, and mortality were recorded. RESULTS: Complete data were available for evaluation of 112 patients of whom 73 (65%) had a BMI < 30, 32 (29%) had a BMI > or = 30 and < 40, and 7 (6%) had a BMI > or = 40. The most frequent indication for splenectomy in all three groups was idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP). The operative times were significantly higher in patients with a BMI > 40. Conversion rates were also higher in this group, although this did not reach statistical significance. Patients with a BMI > 30 experienced similar complication rates when compared with patients with a BMI < 30. Only when patients had a BMI > 40 did they experience more complications. CONCLUSIONS: Laparoscopic splenectomy was performed safely in obese patients (BMI > 30) with similar results to those of nonobese patients. Only in morbidly obese patients (BMI > 40) do outcomes and complications appear to be affected. Obesity should not be a contraindication to laparoscopic splenectomy.","['Dominguez, Edward P', 'Choi, Yong U', 'Scott, Bradford G', 'Yahanda, Alan M', 'Graviss, Edward A', 'Sweeney, John F']","['Dominguez EP', 'Choi YU', 'Scott BG', 'Yahanda AM', 'Graviss EA', 'Sweeney JF']","['Section of Minimally Invasive Surgery, Michael E.

Our goal was to test this bystander-based vaccine strategy in vivo in cancer patients with stage IV disease. METHODS: Patients received three intradermal vaccine injections (irradiated autologous tumor cells plus GM.CD40L bystander cells) at 28-day intervals. Patients with no disease progression received three additional vaccines at 4, 12, and 24 months. Patients were monitored for toxicity, tumor response, and tumor-specific immune responses. RESULTS: Twenty-one patients received at least three vaccine injections, with no toxicity attributable to the vaccine. Immunohistochemistry of vaccine injection site biopsies with CD1a and CD86 antibodies confirmed recruitment and activation of dendritic cells. There was no tumor regression after vaccination, but many patients had stable disease, including six of ten melanoma patients. Four patients developed tumor-specific T-cell responses on ELISPOT testing. One patient, who had stable disease for 24 months, demonstrated an increase in MART-1-specific T-cells by tetramer analysis after re-immunization; biopsy of the tumor that progressed 2 years after the onset of vaccination revealed a massive peritumoral and intratumoral T-cell infiltrate. CONCLUSIONS: Vaccination of cancer patients with autologous tumor cells and GM.CD40L bystander cells (engineered to express GM-CSF and CD40L) is safe, can recruit and activate dendritic cells, and can elicit tumor-specific T-cell responses. Phase-II trials are underway to evaluate the impact of bystander-based vaccines on melanoma and mantle cell lymphoma.","['Dessureault, Sophie', 'Noyes, David', 'Lee, David', 'Dunn, Mary', 'Janssen, William', 'Cantor, Alan', 'Sotomayor, Eduardo', 'Messina, Jane', 'Antonia, Scott J']","['Dessureault S', 'Noyes D', 'Lee D', 'Dunn M', 'Janssen W', 'Cantor A', 'Sotomayor E', 'Messina J', 'Antonia SJ']","['Department of Interdisciplinary Oncology, H.

Furthermore, hotspot mutations in the Abelson tyrosine kinase (ABLK) domain of the bcr-abl gene translocation in Philadelphia chromosome-positive (Ph+) chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) cells confer resistance on the specific kinase blocking agent, STI571. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Genomic DNA from K562, CESS and patient CML cells were amplified using rapid cycle quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction for the gene regions spanning the mutation hotspots. In assays for ABLK exons 4 or 6, exonic or intronic PCR primers were used. RESULTS: We show that separation of cycle threshold (CT) values for log-fold amplicon quantification was 2.9 cycles for ABLK exon 4, and 3.8 cycles for exon 6 with rapid amplification times. K562 CML cells were found to have a approximately 2 log-fold ABLK gene amplification. In contrast, patient CML cells had CT differences of 2.2 for both exon, suggesting that there was no significant ABLK gene amplification. DNA sequencing confirmed that neither K562 nor patient CML cells contained ABLK hotspot mutations. Messenger RNA transcription analysis permitted the assessment of BCR-ABL transcription, which was qualitatively correlated to genomic amplification. CONCLUSIONS: This novel Q-PCR assay was found to have high fidelity and legitimacy, and potentially useful for monitoring minimal residual disease, transcriptionally silent Ph+ CML cells, and bcr-abl gene amplification.","['Gullo, Charles A', 'Chuah, Charles T H', 'Hwang, William Y K', 'Teoh, Gerrard K H']","['Gullo CA', 'Chuah CT', 'Hwang WY', 'Teoh GK']","['Multiple Myeloma Research Laboratory (MMRL), SingHealth Research Facilities, Singapore. gcrcg@cgh.com.sg']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Singapore,Ann Acad Med Singap,"Annals of the Academy of Medicine, Singapore",7503289,"['0 (RNA, Messenger)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Chronic Disease', 'Drug Resistance/*genetics', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*genetics', 'Gene Amplification', 'Genes, abl/*genetics', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*genetics', 'Mutation', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*genetics', 'RNA, Messenger', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction']",,2006/11/15 09:00,2007/02/28 09:00,['2006/11/15 09:00'],"['2006/11/15 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/02/28 09:00 [medline]', '2006/11/15 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Ann Acad Med Singap. 2006 Oct;35(10):680-7.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To this day, the gold standard for studying ion channels is the patch clamp technique. Patch clamping involves careful positioning of a fine-tipped glass micropipette onto the surface of the cell to form a high-resistance (>1 Gohms) seal (""gigaseal""), a procedure that is laborious, vibration-sensitive, and not easily amenable to automation. In addition, the solution inside the pipette cannot be easily exchanged. Recently reported patch clamp chips offer the potential of increased throughput, but to date the overall per-cell performance of most designs has been very low when compared to pipettes, and/or the fabrication process is prohibitively expensive. Here we demonstrate a replica-molded elastomeric patch clamp chip incorporating nanofabricated constrictions, which delivers high-stability gigaseals, with success rates comparable to those of pipettes, using rat basophilic leukemia (RBL) cells. The high stability enables exchanges of both the extracellular and intracellular solution during whole-cell recordings. In a sample of 103 experiments, 66 cells (64%) were successfully immobilized at the patch aperture; 38 cells (58% of immobilized cells, 37% of all cells) were successfully gigasealed; and 25 cells (65% of gigasealed cells, 34% of immobilized cells, 24% of all cells) were successfully perforated for whole-cell access. In the last group of 27 experiments, 79% of the cells could be immobilized, of which 68% could be gigasealed and 46% perforated for whole-cell access, indicating that dexterity is important.","['Chen, Chihchen', 'Folch, Albert']","['Chen C', 'Folch A']","['Department of Bioengineering, University of Washington, Seattle, Washington 98195, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",20060823,England,Lab Chip,Lab on a chip,101128948,['0 (Ion Channels)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cells, Immobilized', 'Electric Impedance', 'Ion Channels/*analysis', '*Microfluidic Analytical Techniques', 'Patch-Clamp Techniques', 'Rats']",,2006/11/15 09:00,2007/05/10 09:00,['2006/11/15 09:00'],"['2006/11/15 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/05/10 09:00 [medline]', '2006/11/15 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1039/b607913j [doi]'],ppublish,Lab Chip. 2006 Oct;6(10):1338-45. doi: 10.1039/b607913j.

THE AIM OF THE STUDY: Is to determine the diagnostic and prognostic role of clinico-pathologic variables, CD23 and Cyclin D1 oncoprotiens in B-SLL/CLL and MCL. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This study included 25 BCLL/ SLL cases and 25 MCL cases. All cases were carefully examined and stained using CD23 and Cyclin D1 immunostaining. RESULTS: There was significant difference between BCLL/ SLL and MCL regarding several items including pattern of growth, where interfollicular pattern was restricted to B-SLL/CLL while nodular and mantle zone pattern were confined to MCL; pseudo-follicles were only present in B-CLL/SLL. Transformed cells, plasmacytoid cells, peripheral blood lymphocytosis, significant longer survival and good prognosis were statistically more prominent in favor of B-CLL/SLL. On the other hand, cell cleavage, epithelioid histiocytes, plasma cells, naked nuclei, hyalinized venules, deposited hyaline material in background and reticular fibers in addition to higher mitotic index per 20 HPF were more significantly identified in favor of MCL. CD23 was expressed as membranous pattern in 16/25 (64%) of B-CLL/SLL cases and 1/25 (4%) of MCL cases. On the other hand, Cyclin D1 was expressed as nuclear staining in 18/25 (72%) of MCL cases and only 1/25 (4%) of B-CLL/SLL cases. Regarding B-CLL/SLL, age >60 years and mitosis >or=10/20 HPF were independent prognostic factors of shorter survival by multivariate analysis. In MCL, Cyclin D1 overexpression and splenomegaly were independent prognostic factors of survival by multivariate analysis. CONCLUSION: Cyclin D1 is not only implicated in tumor genesis of MCL, but also in progression and extension of the disease when expressed in high levels (50% cut off value) and it seems to have prognostic impact in MCL. This can be used as a basis for future therapeutic strategies targeting cell cycle regulators. This study could support the concept that Cyclin D1 and CD23 immunostaining may be reliable diagnostic tools for discrimination between B-CLL/SLL and MCL.","['Asaad, Nancy Yousef', 'Abd El-Wahed, Moshira Mohamed', 'Dawoud, Marwa Mohammed']","['Asaad NY', 'Abd El-Wahed MM', 'Dawoud MM']","['The Department of Pathology, Faculty of Medicine, Menoufiya University.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,England,J Egypt Natl Canc Inst,Journal of the Egyptian National Cancer Institute,9424566,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Receptors, IgE)', '136601-57-5 (Cyclin D1)']",IM,"['Biomarkers, Tumor/*analysis', 'Cyclin D1/metabolism', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*diagnosis/metabolism/mortality', 'Lymphoma, Mantle-Cell/*diagnosis/metabolism/mortality', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', 'Receptors, IgE/metabolism', 'Survival Analysis']",,2006/11/15 09:00,2007/06/07 09:00,['2006/11/15 09:00'],"['2006/11/15 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/06/07 09:00 [medline]', '2006/11/15 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Egypt Natl Canc Inst. 2005 Dec;17(4):279-90.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Transmission of HTLV by blood and organ transplantation has been documented, with some infections leading to clinical disease. Organ donors are tested for anti-HTLV antibodies and donor suitability is determined primarily by results from enzyme immunoassays (EIA). Confirmatory testing is not routinely performed, and the number of false positive organ donors is unknown. METHODS: In order to investigate the contemporary seroprevalence of anti-HTLV I/II antibodies among solid organ donors and determine the number of false positive samples, we tested 1,408 specimens from prospective organ donors in 2002 and 2003. All specimens were tested for anti-HTLV antibodies by a commercial EIA. Repeatedly reactive specimens underwent confirmatory testing using a commercial Western blot. RESULTS: There were 22 repeatedly EIA reactive donor specimens (1.56%). Five specimens did not undergo further testing because of case shutdown or insufficient sample quantity. HTLV I/II western blot confirmed six positives, whereas five were negative and six were indeterminate. The majority of confirmed specimens were positive for antibodies to HTLV-II. CONCLUSIONS: Our data shows that 29% of initially reactive specimens were false positives. With the increasing demand for organs, the unnecessary rejection of organs that are falsely positive for HTLV antibodies becomes of tremendous importance and stresses the need for timely confirmatory testing for HTLV.","['Nowicki, Marek J', 'Matsuoka, Lea', 'Brucal, Dem', 'Chinchilla, Claudia', 'Mone, Thomas', 'Selby, Rick', 'Mendez, Robert']","['Nowicki MJ', 'Matsuoka L', 'Brucal D', 'Chinchilla C', 'Mone T', 'Selby R', 'Mendez R']","['National Institute of Transplantation, Los Angeles, CA 90057, USA. marek@usc.edu']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Transplantation,Transplantation,0132144,"['0 (HTLV-I Antibodies)', '0 (HTLV-II Antibodies)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Blotting, Western', 'Female', 'HTLV-I Antibodies/*blood', 'HTLV-II Antibodies/*blood', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Seroepidemiologic Studies', '*Tissue Donors']",,2006/11/15 09:00,2007/01/11 09:00,['2006/11/15 09:00'],"['2006/11/15 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/01/11 09:00 [medline]', '2006/11/15 09:00 [entrez]']","['10.1097/01.tp.0000236031.03510.75 [doi]', '00007890-200611150-00015 [pii]']",ppublish,Transplantation. 2006 Nov 15;82(9):1210-3. doi: 10.1097/01.tp.0000236031.03510.75.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Persistence of BCR-ABL-positive (bcr-abl(+)) cells or secondary resistance during imatinib therapy frequently occurs. In this study, we investigated the activity of a novel dual ligand specific for peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha and gamma (PPARalpha/gamma) against CML blast crisis cell lines. Exposure of these cell lines (K562, KU812 and KCL22) to TZD18 resulted in a growth inhibition in a dose- and time-dependent manner. This effect may not be mediated through PPARgamma and PPARalpha activation, since antagonists of PPARgamma and/or PPARalpha could not reverse this inhibition. Western blotting analysis showed that expression of the cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor (CDKI) p27(kip1) was enhanced, whereas levels of cyclin E, cyclin D2 and cyclin dependent kinase 2 (CDK-2) were decreased when these cells were treated with TZD18. Most interestingly, TZD18 synergistically enhanced the antiproliferative and pro-apoptotic effect of imatinib.

The molecular basis for the familial pheochromocytoma has been largely elucidated and the role of germline mutation of the VHL, RET, SDHB, and SDHD genes has been established. However, on genotyping a group of 172 sporadic or familial pheochromocytomas, we characterized four unrelated probands with familial pheochromocytomas without any sequence variants of RET (exons 8, 10, 11, 13, 14, 15, and 16) or the entire coding sequence of VHL, SDHB, SDHC, SDHD, and EGLN3 (exon-intron boundaries included). The proband of family 1 is a man who had a bilateral pheochromocytoma at the age of 32 and a local recurrence at the age of 48 years. His brother died of malignant pheochromocytoma and his nephew died suddenly of an undiagnosed pheochromocytoma. The proband of family 2 is a female who had a 5-cm benign adrenal pheochromocytoma at the age of 34 years, while her cousin (maternal branch) had a monolateral pheochromocytoma at the age of 42 years. No other tumors had been reported in either family. The proband of family 3 is a female who had a bilateral pheochromocytoma at the age of 66 years. Her sister had a bilateral pheochromocytoma and breast cancer at the age of 54 years. Several other tumors were recorded in this family, including laryngeal cancer, leukemia, and a case of medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) in one brother. MTC was naturally ruled out in the proband and her sister. In family 4, the proband was a female who had a bilateral pheochromocytoma at the age of 46 years and a local recurrence a few years later, with liver metastases from the pheochromocytoma. Her brother had a monolateral benign pheochromocytoma. The proband also had a melanoma and bilateral renal cysts. This case revealed a VHL sequence variant IVS2+43 A>G, which was also found in one other unrelated sporadic pheochromocytoma. VHL mRNA integrity is currently being evaluated. The proband had no cerebellar or spinal NMR findings or retinal alterations.

Treatment of human promyelocytic leukemia NB4 cells with 0.5muM As(2)O(3) for 30 min induced no DNA breaks, as analyzed by a standard comet assay. However, breaks were detected if these cells were then digested with endonuclease III (EnIII), formamidopyrimidine-DNA glycosylase (Fpg), or a nuclear extract (NE) of NB4 cells. Using either H(2)O(2)-Fe-treated nuclei or As(2)O(3)-treated cells, digestion with either NE or EnIII + Fpg generated the same amount of breaks, and subsequent treatment with EnIII + Fpg resulted in no increase in breaks in NE-digested cells and vice versa. The human cell lines, defective in nucleotide excision protein, such as xeroderma pigmentosum (XP) A, XPD, and XPG, excised Ultraviolet C-induced adducts less rapidly than normal fibroblasts, but excised As(2)O(3) adducts at the same rate as the normal cells. Immunodepletion of the NE with antibody against 8-oxoguanine DNA glycosylase (OGG1) or MutY homolog (MYH) decreased the incision of As(2)O(3)-induced adducts, while antibodies against XPA, XPB, XPD, XPF, or XPG, did not. These results suggest that As(2)O(3) induces the formation of only oxidative DNA adducts and that OGG1 and MYH are involved in this incision process.","['Pu, Yeong-Shiau', 'Jan, Kun-Yan', 'Wang, Tsing-Cheng', 'Wang, Alexander S S', 'Gurr, Jia-Ran']","['Pu YS', 'Jan KY', 'Wang TC', 'Wang AS', 'Gurr JR']","['Department of Urology, National Taiwan University College of Medicine, Taipei 10002, Taiwan, ROC.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20061113,United States,Toxicol Sci,Toxicological sciences : an official journal of the Society of Toxicology,9805461,"['0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (DNA Adducts)', '0 (Environmental Pollutants)', '0 (Ferrous Compounds)', '0 (Oxides)', '39R4TAN1VT (ferrous sulfate)', 'BBX060AN9V (Hydrogen Peroxide)', 'EC 3.2.2.- (DNA Glycosylases)', 'EC 3.2.2.- (mutY adenine glycosylase)', 'EC 3.2.2.- (oxoguanine glycosylase 1, human)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)']",IM,"['Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals', 'Cell Line', 'Comet Assay', 'DNA Adducts/*metabolism', '*DNA Damage', 'DNA Glycosylases/*metabolism', '*DNA Repair', 'Environmental Pollutants/*toxicity', 'Ferrous Compounds/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Hydrogen Peroxide/pharmacology', 'Oxidative Stress/drug effects/genetics', 'Oxides/*toxicity']",,2006/11/15 09:00,2007/04/06 09:00,['2006/11/15 09:00'],"['2006/11/15 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/04/06 09:00 [medline]', '2006/11/15 09:00 [entrez]']","['kfl166 [pii]', '10.1093/toxsci/kfl166 [doi]']",ppublish,Toxicol Sci. 2007 Feb;95(2):376-82. doi: 10.1093/toxsci/kfl166.

In previous studies we and others used CD40 ligation to obtain higher expression of co-stimulatory and adhesion molecules on leukaemic cells from children with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL). This time we assess the cytokine and chemokine gene expression profile in CD40-stimulated ALL cells. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Malignant cells from 25 children with BCP-ALL were stimulated (or not) with huCD40LT and rIL-4 for 96 h. Eleven different molecule, cytokine and chemokine mRNAs levels (CCR7, IL-23, TGF-beta-IP, IFN-gamma, IL-10, CD1a, CD40, CD54, CD80, CD83, CD86) were determined using the real-time PCR technique with TaqMan chemistry using ready-to-use low-density arrays for gene expression by Applied Biosystems. RESULTS: 1) Increases in mRNA levels for CD40, CD54 and CD80 after CD40L and IL-4 stimulation were observed, 2) CCR7 mRNA expression was higher after CD40 ligation than before the culture (p = 0.002), 3) IL-10 mRNA expression was higher after the culture with medium than before the culture (p = 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: The results show that leukaemia-derived dendritic cells obtained with CD40 ligation express CCR7 - chemokine is involved in migration to lymph nodes and does not produce higher amounts of IL-10, a potent immunosuppressive cytokine. Our preclinical findings could be used in the design of immunotherapy trials for the treatment of children with ALL.","['Luczynski, W', 'Ilendo, E', 'Kovalchuk, O', 'Krawczuk-Rybak, M', 'Malinowska, I', 'Koltan, A', 'Szczepanski, T', 'Wysocka, J', 'Jaworowski, R', 'Olejnik, I', 'Chyczewski, L', 'Matysiak, M', 'Wysocki, M', 'Sonta-Jakimczyk, D', 'Wieczorek, M']","['Luczynski W', 'Ilendo E', 'Kovalchuk O', 'Krawczuk-Rybak M', 'Malinowska I', 'Koltan A', 'Szczepanski T', 'Wysocka J', 'Jaworowski R', 'Olejnik I', 'Chyczewski L', 'Matysiak M', 'Wysocki M', 'Sonta-Jakimczyk D', 'Wieczorek M']","['Department of Pediatric Hematology, Medical University in Bialystok, Poland. w.luczynski@wp.pl']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Scand J Clin Lab Invest,Scandinavian journal of clinical and laboratory investigation,0404375,"['0 (CCR7 protein, human)', '0 (CD40 Antigens)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, CCR7)', '0 (Receptors, Chemokine)', '130068-27-8 (Interleukin-10)', '207137-56-2 (Interleukin-4)']",IM,"['CD40 Antigens/*pharmacology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Child', 'Dendritic Cells/drug effects/metabolism/pathology', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-10/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Interleukin-4/pharmacology', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/drug effects/*metabolism/pathology', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis/biosynthesis', 'Receptors, CCR7', 'Receptors, Chemokine/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Up-Regulation/drug effects']",,2006/11/15 09:00,2007/01/12 09:00,['2006/11/15 09:00'],"['2006/11/15 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/01/12 09:00 [medline]', '2006/11/15 09:00 [entrez]']","['UQ74612832707210 [pii]', '10.1080/00365510600931098 [doi]']",ppublish,Scand J Clin Lab Invest. 2006;66(8):695-703. doi: 10.1080/00365510600931098.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Thus, these methods can potentially be used for tailoring treatment and personalize the cure. Although MRD studies are becoming an integral part of the modern management of patients with leukemia, several parameters are critical for the application and interpretation of MRD studies, including therapeutic context, timing of sampling, target genes and sensitivity of the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay, inter-laboratory standardization (particularly relevant in multicenter studies), selection of patients, retrospective or prospective nature of the study.

To cure leukemia, allogeneic HSCT relies on donor T cells in the allograft, which promote engraftment, eradicate malignant cells, and reconstitute immunity. Here, we focus on the open issues of rejection, graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), and infections and the benefits of natural killer (NK) cell alloreactivity and its underlying mechanisms. Donor-versus-recipient NK cell alloreactivity derives from a mismatch between inhibitory receptors for self-major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecules on donor NK clones and the MHC class I ligands on recipient cells. These NK clones sense the missing expression of the self-MHC class I allele on the allogeneic targets and mediate alloreactions.

A salient feature of M1 cells is that they respond to the physiological survival factor interleukin-6 (IL-6), yet lack the tumor suppressor gene p53. Functional wild-type activation of temperature-sensitive p53 protein (p53 val) at permissive temperature in M1-t-p53 cells results in rapid apoptosis, which is blocked by IL-6. How p53 induces M1 apoptosis and how IL-6 protects against p53-induced apoptosis are not fully understood. Here it is shown that p53-mediated apoptosis of M1 cells involves rapid activation of the proapoptotic Fas/CD95 death pathway, which activates caspases 8 and 10. Functional p53 also targets the mitochondria, causing upregulation of proapoptotic Bax, downregulation of prosurvival Bcl-2 and activation of caspase 9. IL-6 was found to protect against p53-induced apoptosis via activation of the PI3K/Akt survival pathway, which in turn counters both the Fas/CD95 and mitochondrial apoptotic pathways and activates the prosurvival transcription factor nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB). Taken together, this work supports a novel model for leukemic progression where cells that acquire the ability to produce an autocrine survival factor, such as IL-6, can bypass normal p53 surveillance function by targeting Akt, which in turn can exert effects on the regulators of apoptosis, such as the Fas/CD95 pathway, the mitochondria and NF-kappaB.","['Vesely, D L', 'Hoffman, B', 'Liebermann, D A']","['Vesely DL', 'Hoffman B', 'Liebermann DA']","['Fels Institute for Cancer Research & Molecular Biology, Temple University School of Medicine, Philadelphia, PA 19140, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20061113,England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/*physiology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-6/*physiology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*enzymology/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/*physiology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/*physiology', 'Signal Transduction/*physiology', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/*physiology']",,2006/11/14 09:00,2007/06/26 09:00,['2006/11/14 09:00'],"['2006/11/14 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/06/26 09:00 [medline]', '2006/11/14 09:00 [entrez]']","['1210109 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.onc.1210109 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2007 May 10;26(21):3041-50. doi: 10.1038/sj.onc.1210109.

This voltage is the source of exposure to contact current that has been hypothesized to behave as a confounder with respect to the association between residential magnetic fields and childhood leukemia. The previous modeling effort has only considered the influence of distribution lines on the B(avg):V(W-E) relationship. This study extends that analysis to include the effect of distribution line unbalance and the presence of nearby transmission lines. The results show that, compared to balanced systems, unbalanced distribution systems had increased B(avg) and V(W-E), with a relatively greater effect on (VW-E). The presence of a transmission line proportionally increased B(avg) and V(W-E) more on balanced systems than unbalanced systems and attenuated the relationship of B(avg) with V(W-E) on systems with 25% unbalance. Increases in B(avg) due to the transmission line were confined to distances within 100-200 m of the line, but increases in V(W-E) extended to the furthest distance included in the model (365 m). The observations reported may be relevant to prior epidemiological studies of magnetic fields and childhood leukemia, and suggest that research efforts continue to explore the role of contact current in potentially explaining those studies.","['Kavet, Robert', 'Daigle, Jeff P', 'Zaffanella, Luciano E']","['Kavet R', 'Daigle JP', 'Zaffanella LE']","['Electric Power Research Institute, P.O.

Horses ranged in age from 0.3 to 20.5 years (median 5.0 years) and included 18 females and 19 males. Weight loss (n = 25) and ventral edema (n = 21) were the most common historical and physical abnormalities. The most common laboratory abnormalities were hyperfibrinogenemia (n = 26), hypoalbuminemia (n = 19), anemia (n = 19), leukemia (n = 14), hyperglobulinemia (n = 13), and thrombocytopenia (n = 13). Thirty-four tumors involved multiple lymphoid tissues and abdominal or thoracic organs, and 3 tumors were restricted to cutaneous and subcutaneous sites. Histopathologically, all tumors diffusely effaced normal lymph node architecture. Tumor cell morphology was heterogeneous in 17 tumors, and 8 tumors had marked histiocytic and multinucleated giant cell infiltrates. Extensive necrosis or focal fibrosis was present in 22 and 4 lymphomas, respectively. Staining of tumor sections with antibodies against CD3 and CD79alpha molecules resulted in classification of T-cell (n = 26) or B-cell (n = 7) origin. Four tumors could not be classified. Most T-cell tumors comprised small to medium CD3(+) lymphocytes, whereas 5 of 7 B-cell tumors were infiltrated by numerous small T lymphocytes and classified as T-cell-rich B-cell lymphoma. Neither estrogen nor progesterone receptor expression was consistently identified by immunochemical assessment of tumor tissues. Fresh tumor cells from 6 horses bound antibodies reactive with equine CD4, CD5, CD8, CD21, or major histocompatibility class II molecules, confirming T-cell (n = 5) or B-cell origin (n = 1). These findings suggest that T-cell lymphoma is more common than B-cell lymphoma in horses and that inflammation, possibly from tumor cytokine production, is frequent.","['Meyer, J', 'Delay, J', 'Bienzle, D']","['Meyer J', 'Delay J', 'Bienzle D']","['Department of Pathobiology, University of Guelph, Guelph, ON N1G 2W1, Canada.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Vet Pathol,Veterinary pathology,0312020,,IM,"['Animals', 'Female', 'Horse Diseases/diagnosis/*pathology', 'Horses', 'Immunochemistry', 'Lymphoma/diagnosis/pathology/*veterinary', 'Male']",,2006/11/14 09:00,2007/01/17 09:00,['2006/11/14 09:00'],"['2006/11/14 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/01/17 09:00 [medline]', '2006/11/14 09:00 [entrez]']","['43/6/914 [pii]', '10.1354/vp.43-6-914 [doi]']",ppublish,Vet Pathol. 2006 Nov;43(6):914-24. doi: 10.1354/vp.43-6-914.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We analyzed the rate, causes, and evolution of hospitalization after HSCT. METHODS: We retrospectively studied 140 consecutive patients who received an autologous HSCT (n = 107; 76.4%) or an allogeneic HSCT (n = 33; 23.6%) in our institution from May 2001 through September 2004. RESULTS: There were 45 readmissions in 28 patients (20%): three (10%) in the autologous and 25 (90%), in the allogeneic HSCT cohorts. The overall median age was 35.3 +/- 13.5 years and 54% were women. Hematologic diseases were: multiple myeloma (n = 1, 4%), myelodysplastic syndrome (n = 2, 7%), acute lymphoblastic leukemia (n = 2, 7%), aplastic anemia (n = 2, 7%), chronic myeloid leukemia (n = 3, 11%), non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (n = 4, 14%), Hodgkin's disease (n = 4, 14%) and acute nonlymphoblastic leukemia (n = 10, 38%). The length of stay for each readmission was 25 +/- 21 days. The median day of readmission was +62.5 (range = +19 to +987); however, 75% occurred between days +30 and +70. The causes of hospitalization were: infections (n = 24, 54%), due to the graft (n = 14, 31%), graft failure (n = 4, 9%), coagulation disorders (n = 2, 4%), and second neoplasm (n = 1, 2%). Mortality due to the transplant was 10 patients (14%) including: graft-versus-host disease (n = 3), sepsis (n = 3), thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (n = 1), and relapse (n = 3). CONCLUSIONS: Although there was a frequent use of hospital resources (20%) after HSCT with patients hospitalized for a median of 25 days, it was beneficial since there were 86% survivors at 36 months follow-up.","['Moya, R', 'Espigado, I', 'Parody, R', 'Carmona, M', 'Marquez, F', 'De Blas, J M']","['Moya R', 'Espigado I', 'Parody R', 'Carmona M', 'Marquez F', 'De Blas JM']","['Servicio de Hematologia y Hemoterapia, Hospital Universitario Virgen del Rocio, Sevilla, Spain. ruth_hematol@yahoo.es']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Transplant Proc,Transplantation proceedings,0243532,,IM,"['Adult', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease/epidemiology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*methods/mortality', 'Humans', 'Length of Stay', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Patient Readmission/*statistics & numerical data', 'Recurrence', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Sepsis/epidemiology', 'Survival Analysis', 'Transplantation, Autologous', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",,2006/11/14 09:00,2007/01/05 09:00,['2006/11/14 09:00'],"['2006/11/14 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/01/05 09:00 [medline]', '2006/11/14 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0041-1345(06)00954-7 [pii]', '10.1016/j.transproceed.2006.08.057 [doi]']",ppublish,Transplant Proc. 2006 Oct;38(8):2591-2. doi: 10.1016/j.transproceed.2006.08.057.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Whey carrier proteins beta-lactoglobulin-A and-B (BLG-A and-B) and chronic myelogenous leukemia cell line K562 were the targets. Fluorescence and CD instruments were used to assess effect of the ligands on the protein structure. Growth inhibitory effect of the Pd(II) complexes towards the cancer cells was measured using 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. Results of fluorescence studies revealed that the complexes had no dithiocarbamate moiety (compounds 3 and 4) could quench the intrinsic fluorescence emission of the proteins at lower concentrations than those had such moiety (compounds 1 and 2). The far-UV-CD studies revealed that the regular secondary structure of BLG-A and -B did not show any noticeable alteration upon interaction with different of Pd(II)-complexes. The results of cell proliferation assay also displayed that Com-1 and Com-2 had more growth inhibitory activity against K562, than Com-3 and Com-4.

We established Ara-C (0.003-1 micromol/l)-resistant NALM-6 leukemia cells, and attempted the characterization of their resistance. METHODS: The Ara-C-resistant cell lines were developed by stepwise increases in the drug. The mRNA expressions were analyzed by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The uptake of Ara-C, deoxycytidine kinase (dCK) activity and cytidine deaminase (CDA) activity were measured using radioisotope methods. Cytotoxicity was evaluated using the MTT [3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide] assay. RESULTS: The mRNA expression of human equilibrative nucleoside transporter-1 (hENT-1), which is an uptake transporter of Ara-C, was initially decreased during the acquisition of resistance to Ara-C. The expression of dCK, an activation enzyme, and of CDA, an inactivation enzyme, was decreased and increased in the late phase, respectively. The cytotoxic effect of Ara-C on parental NALM-6 cells was ameliorated by hENT-1 inhibitors. There were no differences in the cytotoxic effect of other anticancer drugs, but there was similar resistance to nucleoside analogues via hENT-1 between the parental and resistant cells. CONCLUSIONS: Decreased hENT-1 expression and function is causatively responsible for the acquisition of Ara-C resistance and alterations in dCK and CDA contribute to the higher concentration range.","['Kanno, Syu-ichi', 'Hiura, Takako', 'Ohtake, Takaharu', 'Koiwai, Kimiko', 'Suzuki, Hiroyoshi', 'Ujibe, Mayuko', 'Ishikawa, Masaaki']","['Kanno S', 'Hiura T', 'Ohtake T', 'Koiwai K', 'Suzuki H', 'Ujibe M', 'Ishikawa M']","['Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, Cancer Research Institute, Tohoku Pharmaceutical University, and Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, National Hospital Organization, Sendai Medical Center, Japan. syu-kan@tohoku-pharm.ac.jp']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20061109,Netherlands,Clin Chim Acta,Clinica chimica acta; international journal of clinical chemistry,1302422,"['0 (RNA, Messenger)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '46S541971T (Thioinosine)', '64ALC7F90C (Dipyridamole)', 'EC 2.7.1.74 (Deoxycytidine Kinase)', 'EC 3.5.4.5 (Cytidine Deaminase)', 'GV1L2DZM2Z (4-nitrobenzylthioinosine)']",IM,"['Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cytarabine/*pharmacology/toxicity', 'Cytidine Deaminase/metabolism', 'Cytoprotection/drug effects', 'Deoxycytidine Kinase/metabolism', 'Dipyridamole/pharmacology', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Gene Expression/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/enzymology/*pathology', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Thioinosine/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology']",,2006/11/14 09:00,2007/03/07 09:00,['2006/11/14 09:00'],"['2006/02/09 00:00 [received]', '2006/09/08 00:00 [revised]', '2006/09/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2006/11/14 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/03/07 09:00 [medline]', '2006/11/14 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0009-8981(06)00618-8 [pii]', '10.1016/j.cca.2006.09.014 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Chim Acta. 2007 Feb;377(1-2):144-9. doi: 10.1016/j.cca.2006.09.014.

Considering the impact of the structure of newly synthesized anthracyclines on their cellular activity, our data clearly indicated that among tested anthracyclines DOXM, a morpholine derivative of DOX exerted the highest antiproliferative and differentiating activity. An increase of gamma-globin mRNA level caused both by high transcription rate and by mRNA stabilization, as well as an enhancement of expression but not activity of erythroid transcription factor GATA-1 were observed. Therefore, a high level of hemoglobin-containing cells in the presence of DOXM resulted from transcriptional and post-transcriptional events on gamma-globin gene regulation. The same morpholine modification introduced to EDOX did not cause, however, similar effects on cellular level. Characterization of new powerful inducers of erythroid differentiation may contribute to the development of novel compounds for pharmacological approach by differentiation therapy to leukemia or to beta-globin disorder, beta-thalassemia.","['Szulawska, Agata', 'Arkusinska, Justyna', 'Czyz, Malgorzata']","['Szulawska A', 'Arkusinska J', 'Czyz M']","['Department of Molecular Biology of Cancer, Medical University of Lodz, 6/8 Mazowiecka Street, 92-215 Lodz, Poland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20061004,England,Biochem Pharmacol,Biochemical pharmacology,0101032,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (GATA1 Transcription Factor)', '0 (GATA1 protein, human)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', '9004-22-2 (Globins)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Differentiation/*drug effects', 'DNA Primers', 'Doxorubicin/analogs & derivatives/*pharmacology', 'Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay', 'Flow Cytometry', 'GATA1 Transcription Factor/metabolism', 'Globins/*genetics', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*pathology', 'Protein Binding', 'RNA, Messenger/*genetics']",,2006/11/14 09:00,2007/02/23 09:00,['2006/11/14 09:00'],"['2006/07/05 00:00 [received]', '2006/08/10 00:00 [revised]', '2006/09/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2006/11/14 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/02/23 09:00 [medline]', '2006/11/14 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-2952(06)00617-4 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bcp.2006.09.028 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Pharmacol. 2007 Jan 15;73(2):175-84. doi: 10.1016/j.bcp.2006.09.028.

Different concentrations of ZGDHu-1 and the different time of cultivation were used to treat NB4 cells. The proliferation inhibition of NB4 cells was analysed by cell counting, alive cell count, MTT assay. Cell apoptosis was determined by cell morphology, DNA agarose gel electrophoresis, DNA content, Annexin-V/PI and Hoechst 33258 labeling method. The analysis of cell morphological change, expression of CD11b, CD13 and NBT reduction were performed to evaluate the differentiation of NB4 cells. The expressions of bcl-2, bax and phosphorylated p38MAPK or STAT3 were detected by flow cytometry. While the expression of hTERT mRNA in transcriptional level was measured by fluorescence quantitative RT-PCR. The results showed that ZGDHu-1 could inhibit NB4 cell proliferation viability within a certain range of treating time and does, IC(50) values at 48 and 72 hours were 450 ng/ml and 200 ng/ml respectively. A majority of NB4 cells were arrested in G(2/M) phase and a progressive decline of cells was seen in G(0/1). The NB4 cells apoptosis was confirmed by cell typical cell morphology, DNA fragments and sub-G(1) phase peak as well as Hoechst33258 and Annexin-V/PI labeling method with a time-dose-related manner. The morphology of NB4 cells cultured in the presence of 2 - 100 ng/ml ZGDHu-1 for three days was more mature with higher NBT positivity and expressions of CD11b and CD13 than those in control. The expression of phosphor-p38MAPK and bax was increased while phosphor-STAT3 and bcl-2 were unchanged by the treatment of ZGDHu-1. ZGDHu-1 could decrease the expression of hTERT-mRNA in a dose-dependent manner. It is concluded that ZGDHu-1 can inhibit proliferation, induce differentiation and apoptosis of NB4 cells. The mechanism may be associated with up-regulation of bax expression, enhancement of phosphor-p38MAPK activation and inhibition of hTERT-mRNA.","['Zhou, Yong-Lie', 'Lu, Ya-Ping', 'Hu, Wei-Xiao', 'Qiu, Lian-Nu', 'Wang, Wen-Song', 'Wu, Jian-Guo', 'Liu, Jian-Dong']","['Zhou YL', 'Lu YP', 'Hu WX', 'Qiu LN', 'Wang WS', 'Wu JG', 'Liu JD']","['Central Laboratory, Zhejiang Provincial People Hospital, Hangzhou 310014, China. zyl@zjyxjy.com']",['chi'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,China,Zhongguo Shi Yan Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi,Zhongguo shi yan xue ye xue za zhi,101084424,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Heterocyclic Compounds, 1-Ring)', '0', '(N,N-di-(m-methylphenyl)-3,6-dimethyl-1,4-dihydro-1,2,4,5-tetrazine-1,4-dicarboxa', 'mide)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Cell Proliferation/*drug effects', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'Heterocyclic Compounds, 1-Ring/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*pathology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,2006/11/14 09:00,2007/12/21 09:00,['2006/11/14 09:00'],"['2006/11/14 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/12/21 09:00 [medline]', '2006/11/14 09:00 [entrez]']",['1009-2137(2006)05-0880-07 [pii]'],ppublish,Zhongguo Shi Yan Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi. 2006 Oct;14(5):880-6.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Meanwhile, the steady state level of human 8-hydroxyguanine glycosylase (hOGG1) mRNA transcript was monitored by quantitative real-time PCR. The results showed that the defence of antioxidant system was impaired in patients with acute leukemia. The incidence of depression was 47.83% in 92 cases. T-AOC and SOD activities were significantly decreased in patients with depression, while ROS, NO, MDA levels and hOGG1 mRNA expression were reverse of the former. It revealed that depression positively correlated with course of disease and hOGG1, and negatively correlated with T-AOC.

Vitamin D, acquired primarily through exposure to the sun via the skin, is believed to inhibit tumor development and growth and reduce mortality for certain cancers. METHODS: We extend the analysis of this relationship to include cancer incidence as well as mortality, using higher quality and higher resolution data sets than have typically been available. Over three million incident cancer cases between 1998 and 2002 and three million cancer deaths between 1993 and 2002 in the continental United States were regressed against daily satellite-measured solar UV-B levels, adjusting for numerous confounders. Relative risks of reduced solar UV-B exposure were calculated for thirty-two different cancer sites. RESULTS: For non-Hispanic whites, an inverse relationship between solar UV-B exposure and cancer incidence and mortality was observed for ten sites: bladder, colon, Hodgkin lymphoma, myeloma, other biliary, prostate, rectum, stomach, uterus, and vulva. Weaker evidence of an inverse relationship was observed for six sites: breast, kidney, leukemia, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, pancreas, and small intestine. For three sites, inverse relationships were seen that varied markedly by sex: esophagus (stronger in males than females), gallbladder (stronger in females than males), and thyroid (only seen in females). No association was found for bone and joint, brain, larynx, liver, nasal cavity, ovary, soft tissue, male thyroid, and miscellaneous cancers. A positive association between solar UV-B exposure and cancer mortality and incidence was found for anus, cervix, oral cavity, melanoma, and other non-epithelial skin cancer. CONCLUSION: This paper adds to the mounting evidence for the influential role of solar UV-B exposure on cancer, particularly for some of the less-well studied digestive cancers. The relative risks for cancer incidence are similar to those for cancer mortality for most sites. For several sites (breast, colon, rectum, esophagus, other biliary, vulva), the relative risks of mortality are higher, possibly suggesting that the maintenance of adequate vitamin D levels is more critical for limiting tumor progression than for preventing tumor onset. Our findings are generally consistent with the published literature, and include three cancer sites not previously linked with solar UV-B exposure, to our knowledge: leukemia, small intestine, and vulva.","['Boscoe, Francis P', 'Schymura, Maria J']","['Boscoe FP', 'Schymura MJ']","['Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, School of Public Health, University at Albany, Rensselaer, NY 12144, USA. fpb01@health.state.ny.us']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",20061110,England,BMC Cancer,BMC cancer,100967800,,IM,"['Epidemiologic Studies', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Male', 'Mortality/trends', 'Neoplasms/*mortality', 'Risk Factors', 'Ultraviolet Rays/*adverse effects', 'United States/epidemiology']",,2006/11/14 09:00,2006/12/27 09:00,['2006/11/14 09:00'],"['2006/07/05 00:00 [received]', '2006/11/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2006/11/14 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/12/27 09:00 [medline]', '2006/11/14 09:00 [entrez]']","['1471-2407-6-264 [pii]', '10.1186/1471-2407-6-264 [doi]']",epublish,BMC Cancer. 2006 Nov 10;6:264. doi: 10.1186/1471-2407-6-264.,,,,,PMC1665523,,['U55/CCU22012-04/PHS HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,

A four-year-old girl underwent a fully human leukocyte antigen-matched allogeneic BMT for thalassemia major from her mother positive for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg). A 12-yr-old boy with chronic myeloid leukemia, positive for HBsAg and HBV-DNA received a fully HLA-matched allogeneic BMT from his sister in the first chronic phase of the disease. HBIg was successfully used in both cases to prevent HBV reactivation of the recipients.

Furthermore, we expected that these associations would be moderated by child age at diagnosis and gender. METHOD: Peer, teacher, and self-report data were obtained for 82 cancer survivors (age 9-17 years) using classroom rating and nomination procedures that are widely used in research on social development. Information regarding cranial radiation therapy (CRT), intrathecal chemotherapy (ITC), and systemic methotrexate were obtained from medical records and used to create a composite index of CNS treatment intensity. RESULTS: Higher scores on the index of CNS treatment intensity were associated with poorer peer acceptance, fewer friendships, greater social sensitivity-isolation, and diminished leadership-popularity based on peer-report. These associations were stronger for boys and children who were younger (<10 years old) at diagnosis. In contrast, CNS treatment intensity was only predictive of teacher-perceptions of aggressive-disruptive behavior and it was unrelated to social self-perceptions. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that children who receive CRT and ITC are at risk for problematic peer relations, particularly if they are male or younger at diagnosis. Given the stability of poor peer relationships and documented linkages between peer problems and subsequent academic and psychiatric difficulties, clinical services should address these issues. Research is needed to identify mechanisms that account for these outcomes and provide direction for prevention and treatment efforts.","['Vannatta, Kathryn', 'Gerhardt, Cynthia A', 'Wells, Robert J', 'Noll, Robert B']","['Vannatta K', 'Gerhardt CA', 'Wells RJ', 'Noll RB']","[""Center for Biobehavioral Health, Columbus Children's Research Institute, and The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Age Factors', 'Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Central Nervous System/*drug effects/*radiation effects', 'Child', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Cranial Irradiation/adverse effects/*psychology', 'Data Collection', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Injections, Spinal/adverse effects/psychology', 'Interpersonal Relations', 'Male', 'Methotrexate/adverse effects', 'Neoplasms/*psychology/therapy', 'Sex Factors', 'Social Adjustment', 'Social Behavior', 'Survivors']",,2006/11/11 09:00,2007/10/12 09:00,['2006/11/11 09:00'],"['2006/11/11 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/10/12 09:00 [medline]', '2006/11/11 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/pbc.21062 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2007 Oct 15;49(5):716-22. doi: 10.1002/pbc.21062.,,,,,,"['(c) 2007 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) were estimated comparing the observed numbers of second malignancies with the expected numbers obtained from sex-, age-, period- and population-specific incidence rates. Seminomas and nonseminomas, the 2 main histological groups of testicular cancer, were analyzed separately. During a median follow-up period of 8.3 years (0-35 years), we observed 1,811 second tumors, with a corresponding SIR of 1.65 (95% confidence interval (CI): 1.57-1.73). Statistically significant increased risks were found for fifteen cancer types, including SIRs of 2.0 or higher for cancers of the stomach, gallbladder and bile ducts, pancreas, bladder, kidney, thyroid, and for soft-tissue sarcoma, nonmelanoma skin cancer and myeloid leukemia. The SIR for myeloid leukemia was 2.39 (95% CI: 1.41-3.77) after seminomas, and 6.77 (95% CI: 4.14-10.5) after nonseminomas. It increased to 37.9 (95% CI: 18.9-67.8; based on 11 observed cases of leukemia) among nonseminoma patients diagnosed since 1990. SIRs for most solid cancers increased with follow-up duration, whereas they did not change with year of testicular cancer diagnosis. Among subjects diagnosed before 1980, 20 year survivors of seminoma had a cumulative risk of solid cancer of 9.6% (95% CI: 8.7-10.5%) vs. 6.5% expected, whereas 20 years survivors of nonseminoma had a risk of 5.0% (95% CI: 4.2-6.0%) vs. 3.1% expected.

We investigated the relationship between cancer incidence and OC insecticide use among pesticide applicators enrolled in the Agricultural Health Study, a prospective cohort study of 57,311 licensed applicators in Iowa and North Carolina enrolled between 1993 and 1997. Information on ever use of 7 OC insecticides (aldrin, chlordane, DDT, dieldrin, heptachlor, lindane, toxaphene) was collected from a self-administered questionnaire at enrollment. Lifetime exposure-days to OC insecticides were calculated using additional data from a take-home questionnaire completed by 25,291 participants (44% of total). We found no clear evidence of an association between use of OC insecticides and incident cancers (N = 1,150) ascertained through December, 2002. When we focused on individual insecticides and structurally similar groups (aldrin and dieldrin; chlordane and heptachlor), significantly increased relative risks of some cancers were observed for use of some chemicals (rectal cancer and chlordane, lung cancer and dieldrin, non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) and lindane, melanoma and toxaphene, leukemia and chlordane/heptachlor).

The results clearly show that curcumin induces apoptosis in these cells as evidenced by the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria to the cytosol and increase in the DNA content in sub G1 region as observed in FACS analysis. Apoptosis is apparently mediated by up-regulation of apoptotic gene bax and simultaneous down-regulation of anti-apoptotic gene bcl-2 followed by activation of caspases 3 and 8 and degradation of PARP. Telomerase, a reverse transcriptase, has been found to be activated in more than 80% of human cancers and, therefore, can be considered as a potential marker for tumorigenesis. Certain natural compounds have the potential of inhibiting telomerase activity leading to suppression of cell viability and induction of apoptosis. The present study shows that curcumin-induced apoptosis coincides with the inhibition of telomerase activity in a dose dependent manner.","['Mukherjee Nee Chakraborty, Sutapa', 'Ghosh, Utpal', 'Bhattacharyya, N P', 'Bhattacharya, R K', 'Dey, Subhabrata', 'Roy, Madhumita']","['Mukherjee Nee Chakraborty S', 'Ghosh U', 'Bhattacharyya NP', 'Bhattacharya RK', 'Dey S', 'Roy M']","['Department of Environmental Carcinogenesis & Toxicology, Chittaranjan National Cancer Institute, 37, S.P.

We tested whether bortezomib cytotoxicity is affected by multidrug resistance (MDR) proteins expressed in AML cells. We also tested whether bortezomib interactions with cytarabine and anthracyclines are affected by p53, because proteasome inhibition stabilizes p53 and may thus cause cell cycle arrest. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Bortezomib sensitivity of cell lines overexpressing P-glycoprotein, multidrug resistance protein-1, breast cancer resistance protein and lung resistance protein was studied in the presence and absence of established modulators of these transport proteins. Drug interactions during simultaneous and sequential exposure to bortezomib and anthracyclines or cytarabine in diverse ratios were evaluated by isobologram and combination index analyses in AML cell lines with wild type and inactive p53 and were correlated with cell cycle perturbations induced by bortezomib. RESULTS: Of the MDR mechanisms studied, only P-glycoprotein conferred resistance to bortezomib, and resistance was only twofold. Interactions between bortezomib and anthracylines and cytarabine changed from antagonistic to additive or synergistic with increasing drug activity levels and were not affected by p53 status. CONCLUSIONS: MDR proteins and p53 do not affect bortezomib cytotoxicity or in vitro interactions with anthracyclines or cytarabine, but these interactions are concentration-dependent, and this concentration-dependency should be considered in the design of combination regimens.","['Minderman, Hans', 'Zhou, Yunfei', ""O'Loughlin, Kieran L"", 'Baer, Maria R']","['Minderman H', 'Zhou Y', ""O'Loughlin KL"", 'Baer MR']","['Department of Medicine, Roswell Park Cancer Institute, Elm and Carlton Streets, Buffalo, NY 14263, USA. hans.minderman@roswellpark.org']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20061110,Germany,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol,Cancer chemotherapy and pharmacology,7806519,"['0 (Anthracyclines)', '0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Boronic Acids)', '0 (Multidrug Resistance-Associated Proteins)', '0 (Protease Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrazines)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '69G8BD63PP (Bortezomib)']",IM,"['Anthracyclines/*pharmacology', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/*pharmacology', 'Boronic Acids/*pharmacology', 'Bortezomib', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cytarabine/*pharmacology', 'Drug Interactions', 'Drug Resistance, Multiple/physiology', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/physiology', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'HL-60 Cells/drug effects/metabolism/pathology', 'Humans', 'Inhibitory Concentration 50', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Multidrug Resistance-Associated Proteins/metabolism', 'Protease Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Pyrazines/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/*metabolism']",,2006/11/11 09:00,2007/07/06 09:00,['2006/11/11 09:00'],"['2006/07/19 00:00 [received]', '2006/10/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2006/11/11 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/07/06 09:00 [medline]', '2006/11/11 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s00280-006-0367-6 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol. 2007 Jul;60(2):245-55. doi: 10.1007/s00280-006-0367-6.

Bortezomib (Velcade) is the first proteasome inhibitor proven to be clinically useful and will soon be followed by a second generation of small molecule inhibitors with improved pharmacological properties. Although it is now understood that certain types of malignancies have an exquisite dependence on a functional proteasome for their survival, the underlying reason(s) remain unclear as of now. In this context, addiction to nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB)-induced survival signals, activation of the unfolded protein response as well as a reduced proteasomal activity in differentiated plasma cells have all been proposed to justify proteasome inhibitors' activity in susceptible tissues. In addition to their anticancer properties, bortezomib and related drugs modulate inflammatory and immune responses by affecting function and survival of immune cells such as lymphocytes and dendritic cells. The present review offers an overview of the biological effects that have been involved in proteasome inhibitors' antitumor activity and suggests prospective future applications for these drugs based on their recently characterized anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory effects.","['Nencioni, A', 'Grunebach, F', 'Patrone, F', 'Ballestrero, A', 'Brossart, P']","['Nencioni A', 'Grunebach F', 'Patrone F', 'Ballestrero A', 'Brossart P']","['Department of Internal Medicine, University of Genova, Genova, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20061109,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Boronic Acids)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Protease Inhibitors)', '0 (Proteasome Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrazines)', '69G8BD63PP (Bortezomib)']",IM,"['Boronic Acids/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Bortezomib', 'Cardiovascular Diseases/drug therapy', 'Dendritic Cells/drug effects/metabolism', 'Graft vs Host Disease/drug therapy', 'Humans', 'Lymphocytes/drug effects/metabolism', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/*drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Multiple Myeloma/*drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'NF-kappa B/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', '*Protease Inhibitors/pharmacology/therapeutic use', '*Proteasome Inhibitors', 'Pyrazines/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects']",66,2006/11/11 09:00,2007/02/10 09:00,['2006/11/11 09:00'],"['2006/11/11 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/02/10 09:00 [medline]', '2006/11/11 09:00 [entrez]']","['2404444 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.leu.2404444 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2007 Jan;21(1):30-6. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2404444.

Overall response rates to bortezomib were similar in patients with and without del(13q14) (45 versus 55%; P=0.66), and rates of complete remission (CR) near CR were also not different between the two patient populations (18 versus 14%).

We report the clinical and molecular features of a patient initially identified as a potential FA case only because of chemotherapy toxicity during the treatment of a T-lineage acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Cells from this patient showed a moderate chromosomal instability, increasing sensitivity to DNA crosslinking agents but normal response to ionizing radiation. The analysis of FA proteins demonstrated a marked reduction of FANCD2 (>95%), but normal levels of FANCA or FANCG. Interestingly, this defect was associated with a homozygous missense mutation of FANCD2, resulting in a novel amino-acid substitution (Leu153Ser) at residue Leu153, which is highly conserved through evolution. The FANCD2(L153S) protein, whose reduced expression was not due to impaired transcription, was detected also in its monoubiquitinated form in the nucleus, suggesting that the mutation does not affect post-translation modifications or subcellular localization but rather the stability of FANCD2. Therefore, the hypomorphic Leu153Ser mutation represents the first example of a FANCD2 defect that might promote clonal progression of tumors, such as T-ALL, and severe chemotherapy toxicity in patients without any clinical manifestations typical of FA.","['Borriello, A', 'Locasciulli, A', 'Bianco, A M', 'Criscuolo, M', 'Conti, V', 'Grammatico, P', 'Cappellacci, S', 'Zatterale, A', 'Morgese, F', 'Cucciolla, V', 'Delia, D', 'Della Ragione, F', 'Savoia, A']","['Borriello A', 'Locasciulli A', 'Bianco AM', 'Criscuolo M', 'Conti V', 'Grammatico P', 'Cappellacci S', 'Zatterale A', 'Morgese F', 'Cucciolla V', 'Delia D', 'Della Ragione F', 'Savoia A']","['Department of Biochemistry and Biophysics, F Cedrangolo II, University of Naples, Naples, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20061109,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, Myelomonocytic)', '0 (CD33 protein, human)', '0 (FANCD2 protein, human)', '0 (Fanconi Anemia Complementation Group D2 Protein)', '0 (Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 3)', 'EC 3.4.11.2 (CD13 Antigens)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Substitution', 'Antigens, CD', 'Antigens, Differentiation, Myelomonocytic', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/administration & dosage/*adverse effects', 'CD13 Antigens', 'Child', 'Chromosomal Instability', 'Disease Progression', 'Fanconi Anemia/genetics', 'Fanconi Anemia Complementation Group D2 Protein/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Infections/etiology/genetics', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*drug therapy/*genetics/physiopathology', 'Male', '*Mutation', 'Pancytopenia/chemically induced/genetics', 'Remission Induction', 'Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 3']",,2006/11/11 09:00,2007/02/10 09:00,['2006/11/11 09:00'],"['2006/11/11 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/02/10 09:00 [medline]', '2006/11/11 09:00 [entrez]']","['2404468 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.leu.2404468 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2007 Jan;21(1):72-8. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2404468.

In order to identify genes which might be related to drug resistance, we retrospectively studied gene expression patterns in blast populations of 14 patients with de novo AML, focusing on known or potential resistance mechanisms against cytosine arabinoside and anthracyclines. Following induction and postremission chemotherapy, 7 patients achieved a complete remission (CR) for more than 1 year, while 7 patients showed blast persistence (BP) after induction and salvage chemotherapy. Gene expression analysis was performed using RNA extracted from archived guanidine extracts and Affymetrix HGU133A gene chips. We utilized the Gene Ontology category Biological Process to select genes implicated in DNA metabolism, nucleoside and nucleotide metabolism and transport, reactive oxygen species metabolism, apoptosis and response to drugs and identified 32 differentially expressed genes. From this functional perspective, we found differences between the CR and BP groups with regard to nucleotide metabolism (PBEF1, G6PD; p = 0.048), apoptosis (TNFAIP3, TNFAIP8, MPO, BCL2A1, BAX, SON, BNIP3L; p = 0.039) and reactive oxygen species metabolism (SOD2, KIAA0179; p = 0.048). However, the attempt to construct a predictive model of chemoresistance failed. BP samples had a 2-fold higher expression of CD34 than CR samples. Thus, our findings are in line with reports describing differences in apoptosis resistance between CD34+ and CD34- blast populations. Taken together, our results suggest that drug resistance in AML is a heterogenous phenomenon that might be better defined by means of disturbed biological processes than by focusing on the alteration of the expression of distinct genes.","['Eisele, L', 'Klein-Hitpass, L', 'Chatzimanolis, N', 'Opalka, B', 'Boes, T', 'Seeber, S', 'Moritz, T', 'Flasshove, M']","['Eisele L', 'Klein-Hitpass L', 'Chatzimanolis N', 'Opalka B', 'Boes T', 'Seeber S', 'Moritz T', 'Flasshove M']","['Department of Internal Medicine (Cancer Research), University of Essen, Medical School, Essen, Germany. lewin.eisele@uni-essen.de']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20061108,Switzerland,Acta Haematol,Acta haematologica,0141053,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nucleosides)', '0 (Nucleotides)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '11062-77-4 (Superoxides)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antigens, CD34/analysis', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis/genetics', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*genetics', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/drug therapy/*genetics/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Nucleosides/metabolism', 'Nucleotides/metabolism', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Oxidative Stress/genetics', 'RNA, Neoplasm/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Remission Induction', 'Salvage Therapy', 'Superoxides/metabolism', 'Treatment Outcome']",,2006/11/11 09:00,2007/02/16 09:00,['2006/11/11 09:00'],"['2005/12/12 00:00 [received]', '2006/03/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2006/11/11 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/02/16 09:00 [medline]', '2006/11/11 09:00 [entrez]']","['96854 [pii]', '10.1159/000096854 [doi]']",ppublish,Acta Haematol. 2007;117(1):8-15. doi: 10.1159/000096854.

Its contribution to transformation is largely unknown, in particular with respect to survival and apoptosis. We therefore silenced TEL/AML1 expression in leukemic REH cells by RNA inhibition, which eventually led to programmed cell death. Microarray and 2D gel electrophoresis data demonstrated a differential regulation of heat-shock proteins (HSPs), among them HSP90, as well as of its client, survivin. Consistent with these findings, ectopic expression of TEL/AML1 in Ba/F3 cells increased protein levels of HSP90 and survivin and conferred resistance to apoptotic stimuli. Our data suggest that TEL/AML1 not only contributes to leukemogenesis by affecting an antiapoptotic network but also seems to be indispensable for maintaining the malignant phenotype.

With the prolonged overall patient survival achieved by new treatment modalities, additional drugs are required to inhibit bone destruction. We focused on a novel and more potent structural analog of the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug etodolac, known as SDX-308, and its effects on osteoclastogenesis and multiple myeloma cells. SDX-101 is another structural analog of etodolac that is already used in clinical trials for the treatment of B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL). Compared with SDX-101, a 10-fold lower concentration of SDX-308 induced potent (60%-80%) inhibition of osteoclast formation, and a 10- to 100-fold lower concentration inhibited multiple myeloma cell proliferation. Bone resorption was completely inhibited by SDX-308, as determined in dentin-based bone resorption assays. SDX-308 decreased constitutive and RANKL-stimulated NF-kappaB activation and osteoclast formation in an osteoclast cellular model, RAW 264.7. SDX-308 effectively suppressed TNF-alpha-induced IKK-gamma and IkappaB-alpha phosphorylation and degradation and subsequent NF-kappaB activation in human multiple myeloma cells. These results indicate that SDX-308 effectively inhibits multiple myeloma cell proliferation and osteoclast activity, potentially by controlling NF-kappaB activation signaling. We propose that SDX-308 is a promising therapeutic candidate to inhibit multiple myeloma growth and osteoclast activity and that it should receive attention for further study.","['Feng, Rentian', 'Anderson, Gulsum', 'Xiao, Guozhi', 'Elliott, Gary', 'Leoni, Lorenzo', 'Mapara, Markus Y', 'Roodman, G David', 'Lentzsch, Suzanne']","['Feng R', 'Anderson G', 'Xiao G', 'Elliott G', 'Leoni L', 'Mapara MY', 'Roodman GD', 'Lentzsch S']","['Division of Hematology/Oncology, University of Pittsburgh Cancer Institute, PA 15232, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20061109,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal)', '0 (Heterocyclic Compounds, 3-Ring)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (RANK Ligand)', '0 (SDX 308)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal/chemistry/*pharmacology/toxicity', 'Bone Resorption/metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation/*drug effects', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Heterocyclic Compounds, 3-Ring/chemistry/*pharmacology/toxicity', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Multiple Myeloma/*metabolism/*pathology', 'NF-kappa B/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Osteoblasts/cytology/drug effects', 'Osteoclasts/cytology/*drug effects/metabolism', 'RANK Ligand/pharmacology', 'Signal Transduction', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,2006/11/11 09:00,2007/03/21 09:00,['2006/11/11 09:00'],"['2006/11/11 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/03/21 09:00 [medline]', '2006/11/11 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)41940-8 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2006-07-027458 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2007 Mar 1;109(5):2130-8. doi: 10.1182/blood-2006-07-027458.

Methylation patterns are often very heterogeneous, however, presenting a serious challenge for the development of methylation assays for diagnostic purposes. METHODS: We used Pyrosequencing technology to determine the methylation status of 68 CpG sites in the CpG island of the CDKN2B gene [cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 2B (p15, inhibits CDK4)], frequently hypermethylated in myeloid malignancies, in a series of bone marrow samples from patients with myelodysplasia and myeloid leukemia (n = 82) and from 32 controls. A total of 7762 individual methylation sites were quantitatively evaluated. Precision and reproducibility of the quantification was evaluated with several overlapping primers. RESULTS: The use of optimized sequencing primers and the new Pyro Q-CpG software enabled precise and reproducible quantification with a single sequencing primer of up to 15 CpG sites distributed over approximately 100 bp. Extensive statistical analyses of the whole CpG island revealed for the first time disease-specific methylation patterns of the CDKN2B gene in myeloid malignancies and small regions of differential methylation with high discriminatory power that enabled differentiation of even low-grade myelodysplastic syndrome samples from the controls, a result that was confirmed in an independent group of 9 control and 36 patient samples. CONCLUSION: The precise quantitative methylation mapping of whole CpG islands is now possible with Pyrosequencing software in combination with optimized sequencing primers. This method reveals disease-specific methylation patterns and enables the development of specific diagnostic assays.","['Brakensiek, Kai', 'Wingen, Luzie U', 'Langer, Florian', 'Kreipe, Hans', 'Lehmann, Ulrich']","['Brakensiek K', 'Wingen LU', 'Langer F', 'Kreipe H', 'Lehmann U']","['Institute of Pathology, Medizinische Hochschule Hannover, Hannover, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Validation Study']",20061109,England,Clin Chem,Clinical chemistry,9421549,"['0 (CDKN2B protein, human)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p15)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', '*CpG Islands', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p15/*genetics', 'DNA Methylation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*genetics', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*genetics', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA', 'Software']",,2006/11/11 09:00,2007/02/07 09:00,['2006/11/11 09:00'],"['2006/11/11 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/02/07 09:00 [medline]', '2006/11/11 09:00 [entrez]']","['clinchem.2007.072629 [pii]', '10.1373/clinchem.2007.072629 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Chem. 2007 Jan;53(1):17-23. doi: 10.1373/clinchem.2007.072629.

To cure leukemia, we should not only find MRD in time, but also quantitate MRD for instructing treatment and predicting prognosis. This study was to establish a real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) system to quantitate bcr-abl mRNA. METHODS: bcr-abl mRNA in leukemia cell line K562 was amplified by RT-PCR. T-A clone was used to construct the combined plasmid to be standard template; the standard curve of bcr-abl oncogene was drawn. bcr-abl mRNA in bone marrow samples of 16 chronic myelocytic leukemia (CML) patients was quantitated by this method. The sensitivity, stability, and repetition of this method were evaluated. RESULTS: The sensitivity is 10 copies of the recombined plasmid. The coefficient variations (CV) of repetition and stability were 2.19% and 3.21%. The correlation (R) of the standard curve was 0.984. The median bcr-abl level of the 16 CML patients was 4.58x10(4) kb/microg RNA. CONCLUSIONS: Real-time PCR has high sensitivity, repetition, and specificity.

This study was to detect the cell-specific expression of C/EBPepsilon, and to investigate the effect of C/EBPepsilon overexpression on c-Myc expression, cell cycle distribution, and cell differentiation of human myelomonocytic leukemia cell line U-937. METHODS: The expression of C/EBPepsilon in 5 hematopoietic cell lines (U-937, NB4, HL-60, K-562 and Jurkat T cell lines) was tested by semi-quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). According to the RT-PCR results, human myelomonocytic leukemia cell line U-937 was selected and transfected with pcDNA3.1-C/EBPepsilon32 expression vector by electroperforation, and screened by G418 to yield positive clones which were termed U-937-C/EBPepsilon32. The expression of C/EBPepsilon and c-Myc in U937-C/EBPepsilon32 cells was detected by RT-PCR and Western blot; cell cycle and differentiation of U937-C/EBPepsilon32 cells was analyzed by flow cytometry. RESULTS: C/EBPepsilon overexpression obviously increased the expression of CD11b (a cell surface marker of granulocyte maturity). The positive rate of CD11b was significantly higher in U-937-C/EBPepsilon32 cells than in U-937 and U-937-pcDNA3.1 cells(92.56% vs. 77.46% and 74.81%), while c-Myc expression and cell cycle had no changes.

It crosses the blood-brain barrier and has potent antivasospastic and brain-protective effects. While nicaraven scavenges the hydroxyl radical, the mechanism of its protection remains obscure. In addition to the hydroxyl radical scavenging effect, nicaraven also exhibits inhibitory action on poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP). The mechanism of the pharmacological action of nicaraven has not yet been clarified. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Human myeloid HL-525 cells were exposed to ionizing radiation or hydrogen peroxide and the effect of nicaraven on the activation of the Egr-1 promoter was measured. Next, the action of the drug on DNA fragmentation and inhibition of thymidine uptake caused by the genotoxic stimulation of ionizing radiation or cytosine B-D-arabinofuranoside (ara-C) were assessed. Finally, direct inhibition of the PARP enzyme by nicaraven was measured. RESULTS: Nicaraven did not inhibit the activation of the Egr-1 promoter caused by H2O2 and the activation caused by ionizing radiation. However, the drug repressed DNA fragmentation and increased thymidine uptake dose-dependently. Nicaraven had a direct inhibitory effect on PARP. DISCUSSION: The effect of nicaraven on the Egr-1 promoter was different from that of another free-radical scavenger, N-acetyl cysteine. Nicaraven demonstrated similar protection of the PARP inhibitors including 3-aminobenzamide. Since nicaraven directly inhibits the PARP enzyme, the drug might be useful in oncology as well as in studying tissue-damaging conditions characterized by increased PARP activity.","['Watanabe, Michiko', 'Akiyama, Nobutake', 'Sekine, Hiroshi', 'Mori, Mariko', 'Manome, Yoshinobu']","['Watanabe M', 'Akiyama N', 'Sekine H', 'Mori M', 'Manome Y']","['Department of Molecular Cell Biology, Institute of DNA Medicine, Center for Medical Sciences, Jikei University School of Medicine, Minato-ku, Tokyo 105-8461, Japan. troy@jikei.ac.jp']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Greece,Anticancer Res,Anticancer research,8102988,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Antioxidants)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (EGR1 protein, human)', '0 (Early Growth Response Protein 1)', '0 (Free Radical Scavengers)', '0 (Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerase Inhibitors)', '0 (Protective Agents)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '25X51I8RD4 (Niacinamide)', '8J365YF1YH (3-aminobenzamide)', 'BBX060AN9V (Hydrogen Peroxide)', 'EC 2.4.2.30 (Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases)', 'UD8PEV6JBD (nicaraven)', 'VC2W18DGKR (Thymidine)', 'WYQ7N0BPYC (Acetylcysteine)']",IM,"['Acetylcysteine/pharmacology', 'Adenocarcinoma/metabolism/pathology', 'Adenoviridae/genetics', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/*toxicity', 'Antioxidants/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects/radiation effects', 'Benzamides/pharmacology', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects/radiation effects', 'Cytarabine/*toxicity', 'Early Growth Response Protein 1/pharmacology', 'Free Radical Scavengers/pharmacology', 'Genes, Reporter/physiology', 'Humans', 'Hydrogen Peroxide/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/metabolism/pathology', 'Niacinamide/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', '*Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerase Inhibitors', 'Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases/metabolism', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/genetics', 'Protective Agents/*pharmacology', '*Radiation, Ionizing', 'Stomach Neoplasms/metabolism/pathology', 'Thymidine/metabolism', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects/radiation effects']",,2006/11/11 09:00,2006/12/09 09:00,['2006/11/11 09:00'],"['2006/11/11 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/12/09 09:00 [medline]', '2006/11/11 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Anticancer Res. 2006 Sep-Oct;26(5A):3421-7.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Whether, morphinone, an oxidative metabolite of morphine, also induced a similar type of cell death in HL-60 cells was investigated. Morphinone showed slightly higher cytotoxic activity against human tumor cell lines (oral squamous cell carcinoma HSC-2, HSC-3, HSC-4, NA, Ca9-22, promyelocytic leukemia HL-60, cervical carcinoma HeLa) than against normal oral human cells (gingival fibroblast HGF, pulp cells HPC, periodontal ligament fibroblast HPLF). Morphinone also induced an almost undetectable level of internucleosomal DNA fragmentation in the HL-60 cells. Morphinone did not activate caspase-8 or -9 in these cells. Morphinone dose-dependently activated caspase-3 in both HL-60 and HSC-2 cell lines, but to a much lesser extent than actinomycin D. Electron microscopy demonstrated that morphinone induced mitochondrial shrinkage, vacuolization and production of autophagosome and the loss of cell surface microvilli, without destruction of cell surface and nuclear membranes in the HL-60 cells. The autophagy inhibitor 3-methyladenine (0.3-10 mM) slightly inhibited the morphinone-induced cytotoxicity, when corrected for its own cytotoxicity. These data suggest that morphinone induces non-apoptotic cell death in HL-60 cells.","['Takeuchi, Risa', 'Hoshijima, Hiroshi', 'Nagasaka, Hiroshi', 'Chowdhury, Shahead Ali', 'Kikuchi, Hirotaka', 'Kanda, Yumiko', 'Kunii, Shiro', 'Kawase, Masami', 'Sakagami, Hiroshi']","['Takeuchi R', 'Hoshijima H', 'Nagasaka H', 'Chowdhury SA', 'Kikuchi H', 'Kanda Y', 'Kunii S', 'Kawase M', 'Sakagami H']","['Division of Anesthesiology, Department of Comprehensive Medical Sciences, Meikai University School of Dentistry, Sakado, Saitama 350-0283, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Greece,Anticancer Res,Anticancer research,8102988,"['1CC1JFE158 (Dactinomycin)', '28MBK63MAW (morphinone)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 8)', 'Q812464R06 (Hydromorphone)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Autophagy/drug effects', 'Carcinoma, Squamous Cell/metabolism/*pathology', 'Caspase 3/metabolism', 'Caspase 8/metabolism', 'Cell Death/*drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Dactinomycin/pharmacology', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Fibroblasts/drug effects', 'HL-60 Cells/drug effects', 'HeLa Cells/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Hydromorphone/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Mouth Neoplasms/metabolism/*pathology']",,2006/11/11 09:00,2006/12/09 09:00,['2006/11/11 09:00'],"['2006/11/11 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/12/09 09:00 [medline]', '2006/11/11 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Anticancer Res. 2006 Sep-Oct;26(5A):3343-8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Our array-based analyses of gene expression in patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) revealed several genes (MMP8, MMP9, PCNA, JNK2, MAPK p38) with significant increased expression. We suppose that the genes may be implicated in the disease development and a siRNA-suppression can elucidate their functions in leukemogenesis. One of the crucial requirements for this purpose is a high efficiency of siRNA delivery into CML primary cells. Using fluorescein-labeled siRNAs we systematically tested a variety of physical and chemical non-vector based transfection methods in order to evaluate which of them gave the most suitable transfer. Chemically synthesized siRNAs against mentioned genes were transfected into the cells and level of knockdown was determined by real time RT-PCR. Chemical transfection reagents (Oligofectamine, Metafectene, siPORT Amine) commonly used to transfect siRNAs in CML cell lines showed very low siRNA delivery in CML primary cells-mRNA levels decreased at the most to 76%. Electroporation achieved better results (suppression to 63%) but it was associated with high degree of cell death (more than 60%). In the study we obtained the best transfection efficiency using nucleofector technology. Gene expressions ranged 22-37% that remained from original levels. According to our results, nucleofection appears to be the only suitable non-viral method for siRNA delivery into the hard-to-transfect CML primary cells.","['Merkerova, Michaela', 'Klamova, Hana', 'Brdicka, Radim', 'Bruchova, Hana']","['Merkerova M', 'Klamova H', 'Brdicka R', 'Bruchova H']","['Institute of Hematology and Blood Transfusion, U nemocnice 1, 128 20, Prague 2, Czech Republic.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20061109,Netherlands,Mol Biol Rep,Molecular biology reports,0403234,"['0 (RNA, Small Interfering)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'Female', 'Gene Expression/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/genetics/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', '*RNA Interference', 'RNA, Small Interfering/*pharmacology', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,2006/11/10 09:00,2007/08/19 09:00,['2006/11/10 09:00'],"['2006/04/11 00:00 [received]', '2006/06/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2006/11/10 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/08/19 09:00 [medline]', '2006/11/10 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s11033-006-9006-x [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Biol Rep. 2007 Mar;34(1):27-33. doi: 10.1007/s11033-006-9006-x.

The median follow up time was 54 months (range 1-218). The incidence of acute graft vs host disease (GvHD) degrees II-IV and extensive chronic GvHD were not different between the two decades (p = 0.894 and p = 0.422, respectively).

One-year TRM and overall survival were improved in the later decade (33 vs 18%, p = 0.011 and 62 vs 73% at 5 years, p = 0.063, respectively).

Here we show that other data reveal a similarly parabolic relationship for other ionizing radiation-associated phenomena, namely, genetic recombination, chromosomal translocation, cell inactivation and lethality, and human leukemogenesis. Furthermore, the minima for all effects fall in a relatively narrow range of the dose-rate logarithms. Because the only mechanism common to all of these phenomena is the double-strand break (DSB) in DNA, we refer to our previous analysis of the endogenous production of DSBs, from which we concluded that approximately 50 endogenous DSBs occur per cell cycle, although most are repaired without error. Comparison then reveals that their rate of production falls within the range of minima for the several end points pursuant to radiation-induced DSBs.

Research in these areas is often exploratory; even so, there is interest in statistical methods that accurately point to effects that are likely to replicate. Correlations among predictors are used to improve the statistical analysis. We exploit two ideas: non-negative matrix factorization methods that create ordered sets of predictors; and statistical testing within ordered sets which is done sequentially, removing the need for correction for multiple testing within the set. RESULTS: Simulations and theory point to increased statistical power. Computational algorithms are described in detail. The analysis and biological interpretation of a real dataset are given.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Participants were 67 children. Thirty-five (14 boys and 21 girls) were long-time survivors of ALL and 32 (18 boys and 14 girls) were control subjects. The Children's Effort Rating Table (CERT) was used to measure whole-body perceived exertion at low and moderate intensity exercise. Peak oxygen uptake was measured using a motorized treadmill. CERT and physiological data were analysed using 2 x 2 mixed analyses of variance, appropriate t-tests and coefficients of correlation. RESULTS: In absolute terms, boys treated for ALL found perception of effort to be more strenuous at both low (3.9 vs. 3.5 units) and moderate (6.1 vs. 5.3 units) intensity exercise than control subjects, although differences were not significant (p > 0.05); girls treated for ALL found perception of effort to be the same as controls at low intensity exercise (3.1 vs. 3.1 units) but slightly higher than controls at moderate intensity exercise (5.6 vs. 5.2 units); neither of these differences were significant (p > 0.05). When CERT values were adjusted for (.-)VO(2) peak (%) and heart rate (HR) peak (%) differences remained non-significant. There were no significant interactions (Intensity x Group) in males, but the interaction for (.-)VO(2) peak (%) was significant in females (p < 0.05). The main effect for Intensity (low and moderate) was significant for all variables in boys and girls (p < 0.0001). The main effect for Group (ALL and controls) identified significantly greater absolute (b.p.m.) and relative (%) HR values in ALL boys at low and moderate intensity exercise. In female ALL and control subjects the interaction (Intensity x Group) distinguished between (.-)VO(2) peak (%) at moderate intensity exercise and HR peak (%) at low and moderate intensity exercise. Coefficients of correlation between perceived effort and (.-)VO(2) peak (%) in boys and girls were low to high (0.28-0.76), and between absolute and relative HR were also low to high (0.33-0.73). There were low correlations between time 'off therapy' and perceived effort, (.-)VO(2) peak (%) and HR peak (%) (-0.003 to -0.49). CONCLUSION: It was concluded that perception of effort in survivors of ALL at low and moderate intensity exercise was the same as that of control subjects. Correlations between perceived effort and physiological variables at moderate exercise were low to high, while those between perceived effort and time from treatment were generally weak.","['Bell, W', 'Warner, J T', 'Evans, W D', 'Webb, D K H', 'Mullen, R H', 'Gregory, J W']","['Bell W', 'Warner JT', 'Evans WD', 'Webb DK', 'Mullen RH', 'Gregory JW']","['University of Wales Institute, Cyncoed, Cardiff, Wales, UK. wbell@uwic.ac.uk']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,England,Ann Hum Biol,Annals of human biology,0404024,,IM,"['Analysis of Variance', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Exercise Test', 'Exercise Tolerance/physiology', 'Female', 'Heart Rate/physiology', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Oxygen Consumption/physiology', 'Physical Exertion/*physiology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*physiopathology']",,2006/11/10 09:00,2007/01/11 09:00,['2006/11/10 09:00'],"['2006/11/10 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/01/11 09:00 [medline]', '2006/11/10 09:00 [entrez]']","['K0548W4314131R80 [pii]', '10.1080/03014460600687382 [doi]']",ppublish,Ann Hum Biol. 2006 May-Jun;33(3):357-71. doi: 10.1080/03014460600687382.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Our findings showed that the anticancer activities of 5 were due to the side chain attached to the aminophenol moiety. A p-octylaminophenol (p-OAP) provided the most potent anticancer activity among p-alkylaminophenols examined. In this study, we investigated anticancer activities against various cancer cell lines by the new aminophenols, p-dodecylaminophenol (1), p-decylaminophenol (2), N-(4-hydroxyphenyl)dodecananamide (3), and N-(4-hydroxyphenyl)decananamide (4), which exhibits a side chain as long as 5. Cell growth of breast cancer (MCF-7, MCF-7/Adr(R)), prostate cancer (DU-145), and leukemia (HL60) cells was suppressed by 1 and 2 in a fashion dependent on the length of the alkyl chain attached to the aminophenol. In contrast, 3 and 4 were extremely weak. Compound 5 was less potent than 1. Cell growth of liver cancer (HepG2) was not markedly affected by these compounds. In addition, apoptosis of HL60 cells was induced by 1 and 2 in a chain length-dependent manner, but not by 3 and 4. Incorporation of compounds into HL60 cells was in the order 1>2=3>4. These results indicated that anticancer activities for 1 and 2 are correlated with their incorporation into cancer cells and their capability to induce apoptosis, but not for 3 and 4. Compound 1, a potent anticancer agent with potency strikingly greater than 5, may potentially be useful in clinic.","['Ohba, Toshihiro', 'Yamauch, Takayasu', 'Higashiyama, Kimio', 'Takahashi, Noriko']","['Ohba T', 'Yamauch T', 'Higashiyama K', 'Takahashi N']","['Laboratory of Physiological Chemistry, Institute of Medicinal Chemistry, Hoshi University, Shinagawa-ku, Tokyo 142-8501, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20061025,England,Bioorg Med Chem,Bioorganic & medicinal chemistry,9413298,"['0 (Aminophenols)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '187EJ7QEXL (Fenretinide)']",IM,"['Aminophenols/*chemical synthesis/*pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*chemical synthesis/*pharmacology', 'Breast Neoplasms/drug therapy/pathology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'DNA Fragmentation/drug effects', 'Electrophoresis, Agar Gel', 'Female', 'Fenretinide/*analogs & derivatives/*chemical synthesis/pharmacology', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Prostatic Neoplasms/drug therapy/pathology', 'Structure-Activity Relationship']",,2006/11/10 09:00,2007/03/14 09:00,['2006/11/10 09:00'],"['2006/09/29 00:00 [received]', '2006/10/17 00:00 [revised]', '2006/10/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2006/11/10 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/03/14 09:00 [medline]', '2006/11/10 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0968-0896(06)00875-3 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bmc.2006.10.042 [doi]']",ppublish,Bioorg Med Chem. 2007 Jan 15;15(2):847-53. doi: 10.1016/j.bmc.2006.10.042.

It has generally been assumed that cancer induction decreases rapidly at high doses due to cell killing. However, this is not seen in all RT groups, and a model recently developed by Sachs and Brenner [2005. Solid tumor risks after high doses of ionizing radiation. Proc. Natl Acad. Sci. USA 102, 13040-13045] proposed a mechanism for repopulation of cells after radiation exposure that explained why this might happen, at least for solid tumours. In this paper, this model is generalized to allow for heterogeneity in the dose received, and various alternate patterns of repopulation are also considered. The model is fitted to the Japanese atomic bomb survivor leukaemia incidence data, and data for various therapeutically irradiated groups. Two sets of parameters from these model fits are used to assess the sensitivity of model predictions. It is shown that in general allowing for heterogeneity in dose distribution and haematopoietic stem cell migration results in lower risks than the same average dose administered uniformly and without such migration, although this does not hold in the limiting case of complete stem cell repopulation between radiation dose fractions. We also investigate the difference made by assuming a compartmental repopulation signal, and a global repopulation signal. In general we show that in the absence of stochastic extinction, compartmental repopulation always predicts a larger number of mutated cells than global repopulation. However, in certain dose regimes stochastic extinction cannot be ignored, and in these cases the numbers of mutated cells predicted with global repopulation can exceed that for compartmental repopulation. In general, mutant cell numbers are highly overdispersed, with variance much greater than the mean.","['Little, Mark P']",['Little MP'],"['Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, Imperial College Faculty of Medicine, London W2 1PG, UK. mark.little@imperial.ac.uk']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20061001,England,J Theor Biol,Journal of theoretical biology,0376342,,IM,"['Cell Count', 'Cell Movement/physiology/radiation effects', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/physiology/radiation effects', 'Humans', 'Japan/epidemiology', 'Leukemia/*etiology/physiopathology/radiotherapy', 'Mathematics', 'Models, Biological', 'Monte Carlo Method', 'Mutation', 'Nuclear Warfare', 'Radiation Dosage', 'Radiotherapy/adverse effects', 'Risk Factors', 'Signal Transduction/physiology/radiation effects']",,2006/11/10 09:00,2007/05/22 09:00,['2006/11/10 09:00'],"['2006/04/10 00:00 [received]', '2006/09/25 00:00 [revised]', '2006/09/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2006/11/10 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/05/22 09:00 [medline]', '2006/11/10 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0022-5193(06)00450-4 [pii]', '10.1016/j.jtbi.2006.09.026 [doi]']",ppublish,J Theor Biol. 2007 Mar 7;245(1):83-97. doi: 10.1016/j.jtbi.2006.09.026.

A series of 30 patients were evaluated for various unexplained haematological abnormalities between 1997 and 2005, and found to have circulating monoclonal T-cell large granular lymphocytes (T-LGL). These patients fit the diagnosis of T-cell clonopathy of unknown significance (TCUS), which may represent a clinical spectrum of clonal T-LGL proliferation. Our patients were characterised by a complete absence of severe neutropenia (<0.5 x 10(9)/l), absence of recurrent neutropenic infection (0%), negative rheumatoid serology (0%) and a low incidence of constitutional symptoms (20%). This overall asymptomatic clinical presentation appeared to be different from other previously reported series of TCUS or T-LGL leukaemia who typically had symptomatology and required treatment. Our series of 30 patients represented the benign end of the spectrum of clonal T-LGL proliferation, and might reflect diagnosis at earlier stages of the condition relative to other reported series.

RESULTS: In the present study, we have specifically knocked down the expression of FGF4 using AMO (antisense morpholino oligonucleotide)-mediated inhibition and demonstrate that FGF4 acts in the dorsal marginal zone to restrict blood development and promote the development of skeletal muscle. In addition, we used a drug inhibitor of FGF signalling and an inducible form of FGFR1 (FGF receptor 1) to identify a period of competence during late blastula and gastrula stages when FGF signalling acts to regulate blood versus muscle specification. Notably, we found that it is the dorsal activity of FGF that is required to restrict the expression of SCL (stem cell leukaemia) to the ventral blood island. CONCLUSIONS: Our data indicate that FGF4 is a key organizer-derived signal involved in the process of dorsoventral patterning of the mesoderm.","['Isaacs, Harry V', 'Deconinck, Anne E', 'Pownall, Mary E']","['Isaacs HV', 'Deconinck AE', 'Pownall ME']","['Area 11, Department of Biology, University of York, York YO10 5YW, U.K.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Biol Cell,Biology of the cell,8108529,"['0 (Fibroblast Growth Factor 4)', '0 (Oligonucleotides, Antisense)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor, Fibroblast Growth Factor, Type 1)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Blastula/cytology/drug effects/metabolism', 'Blood Cells/cytology/*metabolism', 'Body Patterning/*physiology', 'Cell Differentiation/genetics', 'Cell Lineage/genetics', 'Down-Regulation/genetics', 'Embryo, Nonmammalian', 'Fibroblast Growth Factor 4/genetics/*metabolism', 'Gastrula/cytology/drug effects/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental/genetics', 'Mesoderm/cytology/*metabolism', 'Muscle, Skeletal/cytology/*metabolism', 'Oligonucleotides, Antisense/pharmacology', 'Receptor, Fibroblast Growth Factor, Type 1/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects/physiology', 'Xenopus laevis/*embryology/metabolism']",,2006/11/10 09:00,2007/05/03 09:00,['2006/11/10 09:00'],"['2006/11/10 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/05/03 09:00 [medline]', '2006/11/10 09:00 [entrez]']","['BC20060103 [pii]', '10.1042/BC20060103 [doi]']",ppublish,Biol Cell. 2007 Mar;99(3):165-73. doi: 10.1042/BC20060103.,,,,,,,"['BB/D010039/1/Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council/United', 'Kingdom', 'G0400193/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom', 'Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom']",,,,,,,,,,,,

DiR has absorption and fluorescence maxima at 750 and 782 nm, respectively, which corresponds to low light absorption and autofluorescence in living tissues. This allows us to obtain a significant signal with very low background level. A charge-coupled device (CCD)-based imager is used for noninvasive whole-body imaging of DiR-labeled cell homing in intact animals. This powerful technique can potentially visualize any cell type without use of specific antibodies conjugated with NIR fluorescent tag or loading cells with transporter-delivered NIR fluorophores.

METHODS AND RESULTS: Previously untreated patients with B-chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL), mantle-cell lymphoma (MCL), and small-cell lymphocytic lymphoma (SCLL) were evaluated by flow cytometry. The control group consisted of blood donors. The CD20 density was measured on tumor cell populations in patients and on the B-lymphocytes of the control group. The density was expressed in MESE In the patients with B-CLL and SCLL, the CD20 density was low (25,300 vs. 36,100 MESF) and it was significantly lower than in donors (172,800 MESF; p<0.001). The difference between B-CLL and SCLL patients was not statistically significant. The density in MCL patients (196,300 MESF) was comparable to that of donors.

We compared body composition, muscle strength, and mobility between 75 adult survivors of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and expected values based on population normative data. METHODS: Subjects were young adults treated for childhood ALL between 1970 and 1986, selected randomly from participants in an ongoing study of cancer survivors. DeXA scans were performed to evaluate body composition, and myometry used to measure strength. Mobility was evaluated with the Timed Up and Go (TUG) and 2-min walk (TMW). One sample t-tests compared ALL survivors to population norms. RESULTS: Males had 4.5% and females had 2.3% more body fat than expected (expected males 21.5%, females 36.0%).

An important early requirement for Scl in endothelial development has also been revealed recently in zebrafish embryos, supporting previous findings in scl(-/-) embryoid bodies. Scl depletion culminates most notably in failure of dorsal aorta formation, potentially revealing a role in the formation of hemogenic endothelium. We now present evidence that the requirements for Lmo2 in zebrafish embryos are essentially the same as for Scl. The expression of important hematopoietic regulators is lost, reduced, or delayed, panendothelial gene expression is down-regulated, and aorta-specific marker expression is lost. The close similarity of the phenotypes for Scl and Lmo2 suggest that they perform these early functions in hemangioblast development within a multiprotein complex, as shown for erythropoiesis. Consistent with this, we find that scl morphants cannot be rescued by a non-Lmo2-binding form of Scl but can be rescued by non-DNA-binding forms, suggesting tethering to target genes through DNA-binding partners linked via Lmo2. Interestingly, unlike other hematopoietic regulators, the Scl/Lmo2 complex does not appear to autoregulate, as neither gene's expression is affected by depletion of the other. Thus, expression of these critical regulators is dependent on continued expression of upstream regulators, which may include cell-extrinsic signals.","['Patterson, Lucy J', 'Gering, Martin', 'Eckfeldt, Craig E', 'Green, Anthony R', 'Verfaillie, Catherine M', 'Ekker, Stephen C', 'Patient, Roger']","['Patterson LJ', 'Gering M', 'Eckfeldt CE', 'Green AR', 'Verfaillie CM', 'Ekker SC', 'Patient R']","['Weatherall Institute of Molecular Medicine, Oxford University, John Radcliffe Hospital, Headington, Oxford, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20061107,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (LIM Domain Proteins)', '0 (Lmo2 protein, mouse)', '0 (Metalloproteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Zebrafish Proteins)', '0 (lmo2 protein, zebrafish)', '0 (tal1 protein, zebrafish)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",IM,"['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing', 'Animals', 'Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'DNA/metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/deficiency/genetics/*metabolism', 'Embryo, Nonmammalian/cytology/embryology/metabolism', 'Endothelial Cells/cytology/metabolism', 'Erythroid Cells/cytology/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental', '*Hematopoiesis', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology/metabolism', 'LIM Domain Proteins', 'Metalloproteins/deficiency/genetics/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Myeloid Cells/cytology/metabolism', 'Phenotype', 'Protein Binding', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1', 'Transcription Factors', 'Zebrafish/*blood/embryology/genetics/*metabolism', 'Zebrafish Proteins/deficiency/genetics/*metabolism']",,2006/11/09 09:00,2007/04/03 09:00,['2006/11/09 09:00'],"['2006/11/09 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/04/03 09:00 [medline]', '2006/11/09 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)41845-2 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2006-02-003087 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2007 Mar 15;109(6):2389-98. doi: 10.1182/blood-2006-02-003087.

Children with NF1 are predisposed to juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia (JMML) and lethally irradiated mice given transplants with homozygous Nf1 mutant (Nf1-/-) hematopoietic stem cells develop a fatal myeloproliferative disorder (MPD) that models JMML. We investigated the requirement for signaling through the GM-CSF receptor to initiate and sustain this MPD by generating Nf1 mutant hematopoietic cells lacking the common beta chain (Beta c) of the GM-CSF receptor. Mice reconstituted with Nf1-/-, beta c-/- stem cells did not develop evidence of MPD despite the presence of increased number of immature hematopoietic progenitors in the bone marrow. Interestingly, when the Mx1-Cre transgene was used to inactivate a conditional Nf1 mutant allele in hematopoietic cells, concomitant loss of beta c-/- reduced the severity of the MPD, but did not abrogate it.

Here we asked whether autocrine signaling contributes to survival of BCR/ABL+ cells in the presence of IM and nilotinib (NI; AMN107), a novel, more selective Abl inhibitor. Conditioned media (CM) of IM-resistant LAMA84 cell clones (R-CM) was found to substantially protect IM-naive LAMA cells and primary CML progenitors from IM- or NI-induced cell death. This was due to an increased secretion of the granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), which was identified as the causative factor mediating IM resistance in R-CM. GM-CSF elicited IM and NI drug resistance via a BCR/ABL-independent activation of the janus kinases 2 (JAK-2)/signal transducer and activator of transcription 5 (STAT-5) signaling pathway in GM-CSF receptor alpha receptor (CD116)-expressing cells, including primary CD34+/CD116+ GM progenitors (GMPs). Elevated mRNA and protein levels of GM-CSF were detected in IM-resistant patient samples, suggesting a contribution of GM-CSF secretion for IM and NI resistance in vivo. Importantly, inhibition of JAK-2 with AG490 abrogated GM-CSF-mediated STAT-5 phosphorylation and NI resistance in vitro. Together, adaptive autocrine secretion of GM-CSF mediates BCR/ABL-independent IM and NI resistance via activation of the antiapoptotic JAK-2/STAT-5 pathway. Inhibition of JAK-2 overcomes GM-CSF-induced IM and NI progenitor cell resistance, providing a rationale for the application of JAK-2 inhibitors to eradicate residual disease in CML.","['Wang, Ying', 'Cai, Dali', 'Brendel, Cornelia', 'Barett, Christine', 'Erben, Philipp', 'Manley, Paul W', 'Hochhaus, Andreas', 'Neubauer, Andreas', 'Burchert, Andreas']","['Wang Y', 'Cai D', 'Brendel C', 'Barett C', 'Erben P', 'Manley PW', 'Hochhaus A', 'Neubauer A', 'Burchert A']","['Philipps Universitat Giessen und Marburg, Standort Marburg, Klinik fur Hamatologie, Onkologie und Immunologie, Marburg, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20061107,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Receptors, Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '0 (STAT5 Transcription Factor)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 2)', 'F41401512X (nilotinib)']",IM,"['Benzamides', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/genetics/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Janus Kinase 2/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/metabolism/pathology', 'Myeloid Progenitor Cells/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Piperazines/*pharmacology', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Pyrimidines/*pharmacology', 'Receptors, Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/metabolism', 'STAT5 Transcription Factor/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,2006/11/09 09:00,2007/03/21 09:00,['2006/11/09 09:00'],"['2006/11/09 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/03/21 09:00 [medline]', '2006/11/09 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)41942-1 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2006-08-040022 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2007 Mar 1;109(5):2147-55. doi: 10.1182/blood-2006-08-040022.

Chaetocin largely spares matched normal CD138(-) patient bone marrow leukocytes, normal B cells, and neoplastic B-CLL (chronic lymphocytic leukemia) cells, indicating a high degree of selectivity even in closely lineage-related B cells. Furthermore, chaetocin displays superior ex vivo antimyeloma activity and selectivity than doxorubicin and dexamethasone, and dexamethasone- or doxorubicin-resistant myeloma cell lines are largely non-cross-resistant to chaetocin. Mechanistically, chaetocin is dramatically accumulated in cancer cells via a process inhibited by glutathione and requiring intact/unreduced disulfides for uptake. Once inside the cell, its anticancer activity appears mediated primarily through the imposition of oxidative stress and consequent apoptosis induction. Moreover, the selective antimyeloma effects of chaetocin appear not to reflect differential intracellular accumulation of chaetocin but, instead, heightened sensitivity of myeloma cells to the cytotoxic effects of imposed oxidative stress.

In the present study, its effects on oxidative stress in various mammalian cell lines were investigated. When cell-permeating fluorescent dyes were used as indicators of the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), we found that PAT treatment directly increased intracellular oxidative stress in human embryonic kidney (HEK293) and human promyelocytic leukemia (HL-60) cells. Lipid peroxidation levels were also significantly increased in HL-60 cells and mouse kidney homogenates treated with PAT. Suppression of CuZn-superoxide dismutase (SOD) expression in mammalian cells by small interfering RNA resulted in an increase in PAT-mediated membrane damage, while overexpression of human CuZn-SOD or catalase led to a reduction in damage, indicating the involvement of ROS in PAT toxicity. Pretreatment of HEK293 cells with Tiron, a free radical scavenger, reduced the phosphorylation levels of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) 1/2 elicited by PAT. The ERK1/2 signaling pathway inhibitor, U0126, also significantly decreased the levels of ROS associated with PAT treatment. These findings indicate that PAT treatment results in the ROS production in mammalian cells, and ROS partially contributes to PAT-induced cytotoxicity.

Depending on the breakpoint on chromosome 22 (the Philadelphia chromosome--Ph+) the derivative 9+ encodes either the p40(ABL/BCR) fusion transcript, detectable in about 65% patients suffering from chronic myeloid leukemia, or the p96(ABL/BCR) fusion transcript, detectable in 100% of Ph+ acute lymphatic leukemia patients. The ABL/BCRs are N-terminally truncated BCR mutants. The fact that BCR contains Rho-GEF and Rac-GAP functions strongly suggest an important role in cytoskeleton modeling by regulating the activity of Rho-like GTPases, such as Rho, Rac and cdc42. We, therefore, compared the function of the ABL/BCR proteins with that of wild-type BCR. METHODS: We investigated the effects of BCR and ABL/BCRs i.) on the activation status of Rho, Rac and cdc42 in GTPase-activation assays; ii.) on the actin cytoskeleton by direct immunofluorescence; and iii) on cell motility by studying migration into a three-dimensional stroma spheroid model, adhesion on an endothelial cell layer under shear stress in a flow chamber model, and chemotaxis and endothelial transmigration in a transwell model with an SDF-1alpha gradient. RESULTS: Here we show that both ABL/BCRs lost fundamental functional features of BCR regarding the regulation of small Rho-like GTPases with negative consequences on cell motility, in particular on the capacity to adhere to endothelial cells.

However, there are very few clinicopathologic studies reported in the literature of lymphomas involving the pleura. OBJECTIVE: To characterize the clinicopathologic features of lymphomas involving the pleura. DESIGN: We reviewed the clinicopathologic features of 34 patients with lymphoma involving the pleura proven by biopsy and classified these neoplasms using the World Health Organization classification. RESULTS: There were 22 men and 12 women, with an average age of 62 years (range, 22-82 years). Nine (26.5%) patients had pleural involvement as the only site of disease, 22 (64.7%) had other sites of involvement, and 3 (8.8%) had inadequate staging data. Eighteen (56.2%) of 32 patients with adequate clinical data had a history of lymphoma (including 3 patients with pleural involvement as the only disease site). In 29 (85.3%) cases, a specific diagnosis according to the World Health Organization classification could be made: 17 (58.6%) diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, 5 (17.2%) follicular lymphoma (including a case with areas of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma), 2 (6.9%) small lymphocytic lymphomas/chronic lymphocytic leukemia, 2 (6.9%) precursor T-cell lymphoblastic lymphoma/leukemia, 1 (3.4%) mantle cell lymphoma, 1 (3.4%) posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorder, and 1 (3.4%) classical Hodgkin lymphoma. The other 5 cases were B-cell lymphomas that could not be further classified. Cytologic examination of pleural fluid was performed in 15 cases and was positive for lymphoma in 8 (53.3%) cases.

This dynamic event is mediated by interactions between specific virus envelope proteins with their cell-bound receptors. This process is exemplified by Moloney murine leukemia virus (Mo-MLV) where envelope protein interaction with its receptor, mCAT-1, leads to virus-cell membrane fusion and infection of cells. Here, fluorescent nanoparticles (NPs) were coated with Mo-MLV derived membranes (Mo-NPs) by extrusion. Electron microscopy and biochemical analysis showed tight association of the virus membranes and NPs. The coated NPs mimic native virus by binding and entering only cells expressing the virus receptor. Confocal microscopy revealed that the coated NPs were taken up into endocytic compartments containing receptor and were also seen associated with caveolin, a marker of caveolae. To demonstrate that the Mo-NPs could escape endosomes and deliver a protein cargo into the cell cytosol, beta-lactamase (betalac) was covalently coupled to the Mo-NP cores and incubated with cells. betalac activity was only detected in the cytosol of mCAT-1-expressing cells. This is the first time that virus proteins have been used to specifically target NPs to receptor-bearing cells as well as penetration into the cell cytosol. Extrusion provides a rapid, detergent-free method to couple virus membranes to NPs and should be readily applicable for many other virus and NP types.","['Deniger, Drew C', 'Kolokoltsov, Andrey A', 'Moore, Andrew C', 'Albrecht, Thomas B', 'Davey, Robert A']","['Deniger DC', 'Kolokoltsov AA', 'Moore AC', 'Albrecht TB', 'Davey RA']","['Department of Microbiology and Immunology, University of Texas Medical Branch, Galveston, Texas 77555, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",,United States,Nano Lett,Nano letters,101088070,['0 (Cationic Amino Acid Transporter 1)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Cationic Amino Acid Transporter 1/*chemistry/metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Membrane/chemistry/metabolism', 'Cytosol/chemistry/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/*chemistry/metabolism', 'Nanoparticles/*chemistry', 'Particle Size', 'Surface Properties']",,2006/11/09 09:00,2007/01/24 09:00,['2006/11/09 09:00'],"['2006/11/09 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/01/24 09:00 [medline]', '2006/11/09 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1021/nl061180z [doi]'],ppublish,Nano Lett. 2006 Nov;6(11):2414-21. doi: 10.1021/nl061180z.,,,,,,,"['R01 AI063513/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'U54 AI057156/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,

A group of 24 patients and 24 healthy controls were studied for the total of 15 immunological parameters, including the prevalence of antibodies against human herpesviruses and papillomaviruses. To clearly discriminate between changes associated with the disease and those induced by the therapy, all patients were enrolled prior to the start of any anti-leukaemic therapy. Statistically significant differences between patients and controls were found in the levels of IgA, C4 component of complement, CRP and IL-6, the production of Th1 cytokines in stimulated CD3 cells and the E. coli stimulatory index. The analysis of the interrelationship between the results obtained in the individual patients presented some unexpected findings, such as the lack of correlation between the CRP and IL-6 levels. It will be the purpose of a follow-up to determine whether and how the immune status of the patients prior to the treatment correlates with their response to therapy and how the individual immunological profiles change in the course of the disease.

In the present study, two PPAR-gamma agonists, 15-deoxy-delta (12,14)-prostaglandin J2 (15d-PGJ2) and a synthetic PPAR-gamma agonist troglitazone (TGZ), were used to investigate activated PPAR-gamma-induced apoptosis on human monocyte leukemia U937 and Mono Mac 6 cells in vitro. The results showed that both U937 and Mono Mac 6 cells demonstrated constitutive activation of COX-2 expression; treatment by 15d-PGJ2 and TGZ could induce apoptosis remarkably in human monocyte leukemia cells by disruption of mitochondrial membrane potential, activation of caspase-3, and causing cleavage of the caspase substrate poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP). Further studies revealed that treatment by both 15d-PGJ2 and TGZ remarkably downregulated COX-2 expression in these two kind of monocyte leukemia cells as measured by reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) and Western blot. Furthermore, the expression of Bcl-2 and Bcl-Xl and Mcl-1 was downregulated while Bax expression was upregulated concurrently after the cells were treated by these two agonists, and no variations were found in other Bcl-2 family members such as Bak, Bid, and Bad. Taken together, our results demonstrate for the first time that downregulation of cyclooxygenase-2 expression, disruption of mitochondrial membrane potential, activation of caspase-3, downregulation of Bcl-2, Bcl-Xl, and Mcl-1, and upregulation of Bax are involved in PPAR-gamma agonists-induced apoptosis in these two human monocyte leukemia cells.","['Liu, Jia-Jun', 'Liu, Pei-Qing', 'Lin, Dong-Jun', 'Xiao, Ruo-Zhi', 'Huang, Min', 'Li, Xu-Dong', 'He, Yi', 'Huang, Ren-Wei']","['Liu JJ', 'Liu PQ', 'Lin DJ', 'Xiao RZ', 'Huang M', 'Li XD', 'He Y', 'Huang RW']","[""Department of Hematology and Oncology, Third Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, People's Republic of China. jiajunliu2002@yahoo.com.cn""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20061107,Germany,Ann Hematol,Annals of hematology,9107334,"['0 (Chromans)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (PPAR gamma)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Thiazolidinediones)', '60203-57-8 (9-deoxy-delta-9-prostaglandin D2)', 'EC 1.14.99.1 (Cyclooxygenase 2)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'I66ZZ0ZN0E (Troglitazone)', 'RXY07S6CZ2 (Prostaglandin D2)', 'VC2W18DGKR (Thymidine)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Blotting, Western', 'Caspase 3/*metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Chromans/pharmacology', 'Cyclooxygenase 2/*metabolism', 'DNA, Neoplasm/metabolism', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Gene Expression/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Membrane Potential, Mitochondrial/drug effects', 'Monocytes/drug effects/metabolism/pathology', 'PPAR gamma/*agonists/genetics/metabolism', 'Prostaglandin D2/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Thiazolidinediones/pharmacology', 'Thymidine/metabolism', 'Troglitazone', 'U937 Cells']",,2006/11/08 09:00,2007/11/08 09:00,['2006/11/08 09:00'],"['2006/06/25 00:00 [received]', '2006/09/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2006/11/08 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/11/08 09:00 [medline]', '2006/11/08 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s00277-006-0205-2 [doi]'],ppublish,Ann Hematol. 2007 Mar;86(3):173-83. doi: 10.1007/s00277-006-0205-2.

Since then we have investigated the in vivo efficacy of PHI. The effects of PHI were evaluated in immunodeficient mice, with xenografts of human leukemia HL-60 cells. The maximum tolerated dose (MTD) was determined. The experimental mice received 80% of the MTD. Oral feedings of PHI significantly reduced tumor incidence (p<0.05) without overt toxicity. PHI inhibited cell cycle progression through the down-regulation of cyclin expression, Rb phosphorylation and the up-regulation of the cdk-inhibitors. Apoptosis was significantly increased in the treated tumors but not in the normal mouse tissues.

In the present study, we have tested the possible anti-leukemia potential of a combination regimen including crocodile egg extract, wild radix ginseng and natural Ganoderma lucidum (CGG extract) on acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) in vitro. A water soluble CGG extract was prepared and its antiproliferative activity was tested on the KG1a AML cell line and two freshly prepared bone marrow aspirate samples isolated from patients with de novo AML during presentation by a MTS/PMS assay. Furthermore, the possible activity of the CGG extract on the regeneration potential of KG1a cells was also investigated using a semi-solid methyl-cellulose colony formation assay. Lastly, the acute toxicity of CGG extract was further examined by a single high-dose oral feeding to rats. We found that the CGG extract could possess significant antiproliferative activity on AML cells. A strong colony formation inhibition was further demonstrated on KG1a cells. After feeding the rats with an excessive dose of CGG extract, we observed no development of acute toxicity. We concluded that the CGG extract has growth inhibitory potential on KG1a cells and AML bone marrow samples in vitro. An in vivo toxicity test revealed that no acute toxicity was observed after feeding the rats a high dosage of the CGG extract. Further animal model tests are necessary to investigate the possible chronic toxicity of the CGG extract.","['Chui, Chung Hin', 'Wong, Raymond Siu Ming', 'Cheng, Gregory Yin Ming', 'Lau, Fung Yi', 'Kok, Stanton Hon Lung', 'Cheng, Chor Hing', 'Cheung, Filly', 'Tang, Wing Ka', 'Teo, Ivy Tuang Ngo', 'Chan, Albert Sun Chi', 'Tang, Johnny Cheuk On']","['Chui CH', 'Wong RS', 'Cheng GY', 'Lau FY', 'Kok SH', 'Cheng CH', 'Cheung F', 'Tang WK', 'Teo IT', 'Chan AS', 'Tang JC']","['Central Laboratory of the Institute of Molecular Technology for Drug Discovery and Synthesis, State Key Laboratory of Chinese Medicine and Molecular Pharmacology, The Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Kowloon, Hong Kong, P.R.

However, its toxicity on the renal system and suppression effect on bone marrow limits its usage clinically. A synthetic analogue of cantharidin (CAN 037) has been shown to have cytotoxic effect on the SK-Hep 1 hepatoma cell line but its underlying working principle remains undefined. Here we further report the action of CAN 037 on an acute myelogenous leukaemia (AML) cell line, KG1a. [3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tet razolium] (MTS) assay was used to demonstrate the cytotoxicity of CAN 037 on KG1a cells. Morphological changes of CAN 037-treated leukaemia cells were recorded under an inverted microscope. Possible activation of caspase 3, 8 and 9 from KG1a cells was also investigated. KG1a AML cells were sensitive to CAN 037. Morphological changes including cell shrinkage and loss of colony formation ability were observed. Caspase 3, 8 and 9 activity was elevated, whereas pre-incubating the KG1a cells with the generic caspase inhibitor z-VAD-fmk could only partially reverse the CAN 037-induced cell death. In addition to the SK-Hep-1 hepatoma cell line, CAN 037 is also effective in inducing the death of KG1a AML cells in vitro. Apoptosis is involved in the action of CAN 037 including the activation of the caspase family. Caspase-dependent cell death pathway may be necessary but not essential in CAN 037-induced apoptosis of KG1a cells. Further consideration of the structural activity relationship of CAN 037 may provide opportunities to improve its therapeutic value.","['Kok, Stanton Hon Lung', 'Chui, Chung Hin', 'Lam, Wing Sze', 'Chen, Jien', 'Lau, Fung Yi', 'Wong, Raymund Siu Ming', 'Cheng, Gregory Yin Ming', 'Tang, Wing Ka', 'Teo, Ivy Tuang Ngo', 'Cheung, Filly', 'Cheng, Chor Hing', 'Chan, Albert Sun Chi', 'Tang, Johnny Cheuk On']","['Kok SH', 'Chui CH', 'Lam WS', 'Chen J', 'Lau FY', 'Wong RS', 'Cheng GY', 'Tang WK', 'Teo IT', 'Cheung F', 'Cheng CH', 'Chan AS', 'Tang JC']","['State Key Laboratory of Chinese Medicine and Molecular Pharmacology, Department of Applied Biology and Chemical Technology, The Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Hong Kong, PR China']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Greece,Int J Mol Med,International journal of molecular medicine,9810955,"['EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'IGL471WQ8P (Cantharidin)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Cantharidin/analogs & derivatives/chemical synthesis/chemistry/*toxicity', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cytotoxicity Tests, Immunologic', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Molecular Structure', 'Nuclear Magnetic Resonance, Biomolecular', 'Structure-Activity Relationship']",,2006/11/08 09:00,2007/01/24 09:00,['2006/11/08 09:00'],"['2006/11/08 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/01/24 09:00 [medline]', '2006/11/08 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Int J Mol Med. 2006 Dec;18(6):1217-21.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In particular the assay provides drug/target interaction data that can facilitate the selection of lead compounds for further evaluation in more sophisticated solid tumour models, whilst successfully implementing the 3Rs - the 'replacement' 'refinement' and 'reduction' of animals. This more ethical and rapid approach to early drug development does not compromise on the validity, sensitivity, predictivity or efficacy of preclinical evaluation. We present novel data using the standard cross-linker mitomycin C (MMC) as a positive control, and two investigational DNA interactive molecules (C1311/ SJG-136). Tumour cells were seeded in fibres and implanted into mice. Following treatment with an intraperitoneal injection, fibres were excised and cells retrieved for pharmacodynamic analysis using the comet assay/fluorescence microscopy. Microscopy results revealed nuclear uptake and localisation within cytoplasmic organelles of HT29 colorectal adenocarcinoma cells following treatment with C1311 (150 mg/kg). Following treatment with SJG-136 (0.3 mg/kg) a 27.3% (p<0.001) DNA cross-linking (s.c.) effect was observed in the HL60 acute promyelocytic leukaemia cell line. DNA cross-linking effects of 55% (i.p) and 50% (s.c.) (p<0.005) were observed in the A549 lung carcinoma cell line following administration of MMC (6 mg/kg).

Mutations in the hCDC4 gene have been found in several solid tumors such as pancreas, colorectal or endometrial cancer. We carried out a mutation analysis of the hCDC4 gene in 35 samples of patients with Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) to elucidate a possible role of hCDC4 mutations in this disease. By direct DNA sequencing and digestion with Surveyor nuclease one heterozygous mutation in the 5' untranslated region of exon 1, transcript variant 3 was detected. Additionally, we could identify a new intronic SNP downstream of exon 10. The new variation was present in 20% of AML samples and was furthermore confirmed in a panel of 51 healthy individuals where it displayed a frequency of 14%. In conclusion we provide first data that in contrast to several solid tumors, mutations in the hCDC4 gene may not play a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of AML. Furthermore, we describe a new intronic polymorphism with high frequency in the intron sequence of the hCDC4 gene.","['Nowak, Daniel', 'Mossner, Maximilian', 'Baldus, Claudia D', 'Hopfer, Olaf', 'Thiel, Eckhard', 'Hofmann, Wolf-Karsten']","['Nowak D', 'Mossner M', 'Baldus CD', 'Hopfer O', 'Thiel E', 'Hofmann WK']","['Department of Hematology, Oncology and Transfusion Medicine, Charite, University Hospital Benjamin Franklin, Berlin, Germany. daniel.nowak@charite.de']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20061026,Australia,Int J Med Sci,International journal of medical sciences,101213954,,,,,2006/11/08 09:00,2006/11/08 09:01,['2006/11/08 09:00'],"['2006/08/25 00:00 [received]', '2006/10/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2006/11/08 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/11/08 09:01 [medline]', '2006/11/08 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.7150/ijms.3.148 [doi]'],epublish,Int J Med Sci. 2006 Oct 26;3(4):148-51. doi: 10.7150/ijms.3.148.,,,,,PMC1633823,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Given the dramatic activity of lenalidomide in other B-cell malignancies and its pleotropic immunomodulatory effects, we conducted a phase II trial of this agent in CLL. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with relapsed or refractory B-cell CLL (B-CLL) were eligible if they required treatment as per the National Cancer Institute Working Group 1996 guidelines. Lenalidomide was administered orally at 25 mg on days 1 through 21 of a 28-day cycle. Response was assessed after each cycle. Patients were to continue treatment until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or complete remission. Rituximab was added to lenalidomide on disease progression. RESULTS: Forty-five patients were enrolled, with a median age of 64 years. Sixty-four percent of the patients had Rai stage III or IV disease, and 51% were refractory to fludarabine. The overall response rate was 47%, with 9% of the patients attaining a complete remission. Fatigue, thrombocytopenia, and neutropenia were the most common adverse effects noted in 83%, 78%, and 78% of the patients, respectively. CONCLUSION: Lenalidomide is clinically active in patients with relapsed or refractory B-CLL. These findings are encouraging and warrant further investigation of this agent in the treatment of this disorder.","['Chanan-Khan, Asher', 'Miller, Kena C', 'Musial, Laurie', 'Lawrence, David', 'Padmanabhan, Swaminathan', 'Takeshita, Kenichi', 'Porter, Carl W', 'Goodrich, David W', 'Bernstein, Zale P', 'Wallace, Paul', 'Spaner, David', 'Mohr, Alice', 'Byrne, Catriona', 'Hernandez-Ilizaliturri, Francisco', 'Chrystal, Cynthia', 'Starostik, Petr', 'Czuczman, Myron S']","['Chanan-Khan A', 'Miller KC', 'Musial L', 'Lawrence D', 'Padmanabhan S', 'Takeshita K', 'Porter CW', 'Goodrich DW', 'Bernstein ZP', 'Wallace P', 'Spaner D', 'Mohr A', 'Byrne C', 'Hernandez-Ilizaliturri F', 'Chrystal C', 'Starostik P', 'Czuczman MS']","['Department of Medicine, Roswell Park Cancer Institute, Buffalo, NY 14263, USA. asher.chanan-khan@roswellpark.org']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial, Phase II', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20061106,United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Immunologic Factors)', '4Z8R6ORS6L (Thalidomide)', 'F0P408N6V4 (Lenalidomide)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Fatigue/chemically induced', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunologic Factors/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Lenalidomide', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local/drug therapy', 'Neutropenia/chemically induced', 'Remission Induction', 'Thalidomide/adverse effects/*analogs & derivatives/therapeutic use', 'Thrombocytopenia/chemically induced']",,2006/11/08 09:00,2006/12/16 09:00,['2006/11/08 09:00'],"['2006/11/08 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/12/16 09:00 [medline]', '2006/11/08 09:00 [entrez]']","['JCO.2005.05.0401 [pii]', '10.1200/JCO.2005.05.0401 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2006 Dec 1;24(34):5343-9. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2005.05.0401.

Relative risks (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of stroke by treatment exposures were examined by multivariate analyses. RESULTS: Thirty-seven leukemia survivors and 63 brain tumor survivors reported a late-occurring stroke. The rate of late-occurring stroke for leukemia survivors was 57.9 per 100,000 person-years (95% CI, 41.2 to 78.7). The RR of stroke for leukemia survivors compared with the sibling comparison group was 6.4 (95% CI, 3.0 to 13.8; P < .0001). The rate of late-occurring stroke for brain tumor survivors was 267.6 per 100,000 person-years (95% CI, 206.8 to 339.2).

Molecular profiling of the NCI-60 cancer cell lines using five different microarray platforms showed strong negative correlations of asparagine synthetase (ASNS) expression and DNA copy number with sensitivity to l-ASP in the leukemia and ovarian cancer cell subsets. To assess whether the ovarian relationship is causal, we used RNA interference to silence ASNS in three ovarian lines and observed 4- to 5-fold potentiation of sensitivity to l-ASP with two of the lines. For OVCAR-8, the line that expresses the least ASNS, the potentiation was >500-fold. Significantly, that potentiation was >700-fold in the multidrug-resistant derivative OVCAR-8/ADR, showing that the causal relationship between ASNS expression and l-ASP activity survives development of classical multidrug resistance. Tissue microarrays confirmed low ASNS expression in a subset of clinical ovarian cancers as well as other tumor types. Overall, this pharmacogenomic/pharmacoproteomic study suggests the use of l-ASP for treatment of a subset of ovarian cancers (and perhaps other tumor types), with ASNS as a biomarker for patient selection.","['Lorenzi, Philip L', 'Reinhold, William C', 'Rudelius, Martina', 'Gunsior, Michele', 'Shankavaram, Uma', 'Bussey, Kimberly J', 'Scherf, Uwe', 'Eichler, Gabriel S', 'Martin, Scott E', 'Chin, Koei', 'Gray, Joe W', 'Kohn, Elise C', 'Horak, Ivan D', 'Von Hoff, Daniel D', 'Raffeld, Mark', 'Goldsmith, Paul K', 'Caplen, Natasha J', 'Weinstein, John N']","['Lorenzi PL', 'Reinhold WC', 'Rudelius M', 'Gunsior M', 'Shankavaram U', 'Bussey KJ', 'Scherf U', 'Eichler GS', 'Martin SE', 'Chin K', 'Gray JW', 'Kohn EC', 'Horak ID', 'Von Hoff DD', 'Raffeld M', 'Goldsmith PK', 'Caplen NJ', 'Weinstein JN']","['Genomics and Bioinformatics Group, Room 5056B, 37 Convent Drive, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA. jw4i@nih.gov']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural']",20061106,United States,Mol Cancer Ther,Molecular cancer therapeutics,101132535,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', 'EC 3.5.1.1 (Asparaginase)', 'EC 6.3.1.1 (Aspartate-Ammonia Ligase)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology/toxicity', 'Asparaginase/*pharmacology/toxicity', 'Aspartate-Ammonia Ligase/genetics/*metabolism', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'DNA, Neoplasm/metabolism', 'Drug Resistance, Multiple', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Humans', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Ovarian Neoplasms/*enzymology/pathology', 'RNA Interference', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Time Factors']",,2006/11/08 09:00,2007/02/16 09:00,['2006/11/08 09:00'],"['2006/11/08 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/02/16 09:00 [medline]', '2006/11/08 09:00 [entrez]']","['1535-7163.MCT-06-0447 [pii]', '10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-06-0447 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Cancer Ther. 2006 Nov;5(11):2613-23. doi: 10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-06-0447.

However, previous epidemiologic studies were limited in size to establish an association between HCV infection and specific lymphoma subtypes. We performed a large, multicenter, case-control study to address this question. METHODS: The study comprised 5 European countries and included newly diagnosed cases of any lymphoid malignancy recruited between 1998 and 2004. Controls were matched to cases by 5-year age group, sex, and study center. In-person interviews were conducted to collect data on demographic, medical, and family history as well as environmental exposures. Serum samples of 1807 cases and 1788 controls (excluding human immunodeficiency virus-positive and organ-transplantation subjects) were screened for HCV infection using an enzyme immunoassay. Positive as well as randomly selected negative samples were subjected to HCV RNA detection and HCV genotyping. RESULTS: HCV infection was detected in 53 (2.9%) lymphoma cases and in 41 (2.3%) control subjects (odds ratio [OR], 1.42; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.93-2.15). Restricted to individuals who tested positive for HCV-RNA (indicating persistent infection and active viral replication), the OR was 1.82 (95% CI: 1.13-2.91). In subtype-specific analyses, HCV prevalence was associated with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (OR, 2.19; 95% CI: 1.23-3.91) but not with chronic lymphocytic leukemia or follicular, Hodgkin's, or T-cell lymphoma. The sample size was not sufficient to derive any conclusions for rare lymphoma entities such as splenic marginal zone lymphoma. CONCLUSIONS: These results support a model that chronic HCV replication contributes to lymphomagenesis and establish a specific role of HCV infection in the pathogenesis of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.","['Nieters, Alexandra', 'Kallinowski, Birgit', 'Brennan, Paul', 'Ott, Melanie', 'Maynadie, Marc', 'Benavente, Yolanda', 'Foretova, Lenka', 'Cocco, Pier Luigi', 'Staines, Anthony', 'Vornanen, Martine', 'Whitby, Denise', 'Boffetta, Paolo', 'Becker, Nikolaus', 'De Sanjose, Silvia']","['Nieters A', 'Kallinowski B', 'Brennan P', 'Ott M', 'Maynadie M', 'Benavente Y', 'Foretova L', 'Cocco PL', 'Staines A', 'Vornanen M', 'Whitby D', 'Boffetta P', 'Becker N', 'De Sanjose S']","['German Cancer Research Center, Heidelberg, Germany. a.nieters@dkfz.de']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20060920,United States,Gastroenterology,Gastroenterology,0374630,"['0 (RNA, Viral)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Data Interpretation, Statistical', 'Europe/epidemiology', 'Female', 'Hepacivirus/genetics/pathogenicity', 'Hepatitis C/blood/*complications/*epidemiology', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse/blood/*epidemiology/*virology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prevalence', 'RNA, Viral/blood', 'Risk Factors']",,2006/11/08 09:00,2007/01/31 09:00,['2006/11/08 09:00'],"['2006/05/25 00:00 [received]', '2006/09/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2006/11/08 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/01/31 09:00 [medline]', '2006/11/08 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0016-5085(06)02079-8 [pii]', '10.1053/j.gastro.2006.09.019 [doi]']",ppublish,Gastroenterology. 2006 Dec;131(6):1879-86. doi: 10.1053/j.gastro.2006.09.019.

We present the results of treatment of Philadelphia chromosome-negative (Ph-) ALL patients over 55 yr treated in the PETHEMA ALL-96 trial. PATIENTS AND METHODS: From 1996 to 2006, 33 patients > or = 55 yr with Ph- ALL were included. Induction therapy was vincristine, daunorubicin, prednisone, asparaginase, and cyclophosphamide over 5 weeks. Central nervous system (CNS) prophylaxis involved triple intrathecal (IT) therapy, 14 doses over the first year. Consolidation-1 included mercaptopurine, methotrexate, teniposide and cytarabine, followed by one consolidation-2 cycle similar to the induction cycle. Maintenance consisted of mercaptopurine and methotrexate up to 2 yr in complete remission (CR) with monthly reinduction cycles (vincristine, prednisone and asparaginase) during the first year. RESULTS: Median (range) age was 65 yr (56-77). Phenotype (30 patients): early-pre-B 7, common/pre-B 18, T 5. Cytogenetics (28 patients): normal 12, complex 10, t(4;11) 2 and other 4. CR was achieved in 19/33 (57.6%) patients, early death occurred in 12 (36.4%) and 2 (6%) were resistant. Overall survival and disease-free survival probabilities (2 yr, 95% CI) were 39% (21%-57%) and 46% (22%-70%), respectively (median follow up of 24 months). Removal of asparaginase and cyclophosphamide from the induction decreased induction death (OR 0.119, CI 95% 0.022-0.637, P = 0.013) and increased survival (20% vs. 52%, P = 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The prognosis of elderly Ph- ALL patients is poor.

However, the intensive cytostatic therapy may lead to late side effects influencing quality of life. AIM OF THE STUDY: Analysis of the reconvalescence of the immune functions after completion of therapy for malignancies in children. PATIENTS: 88 long-term survivors (51 boys, 37 girls) were investigated (43 acute lymphoid leukemia, 15 lymphoma, 20 bone tumors, 10 other solid tumors). Mean age at the time of diagnosis was 7.8 years (1 mo-17.7 years). METHODS: The following parameters were investigated: serum immunoglobulin levels after completion of the chemotherapy and in the next 4 years thereafter, lymphocyte subpopulations in the peripheral blood by flow-cytometry and cellular immunity by in vitro tests (natural killer activity, antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity, mitogen-induced T- and B-cell blastic transformations). RESULTS: Lower serum immunoglobulin (IgG) levels could be detected in patients with leukemia after completion of the chemotherapy (8.8 +/- 3.2 g/l). One year thereafter serum IgG levels increased significantly (10.1 +/- 2.9 g/l) (p<0.05). In patients with solid tumors the serum IgG levels were in the normal range at the end of the chemotherapy (12.1 +/- 4.3 g/l). At a mean of 1.3 years after the end of chemotherapy NK activity decreased in 7/43 (16.3%) leukemia patients, and in 3/45 (6.7%) solid tumor patients, ADCC decreased in 8/43 (18.6%) and 3/45 (6.7%), respectively (p<0.05 leukemia vs. solid tumor). At a mean of 15 months after the end of the therapy B-cell blastic transformation was decreased in 3/43 (7%) leukemia patients and in 4/45 (8.9%) solid tumor patients. At the same time point T-cell blastic transformation was altered in 5/43 (11.6%) and in 4/45 (8.9%) cases, respectively. CONCLUSION: Cytotoxic therapies lead to severe, long-term depression of the immune system. At the end of the chemotherapy this effect is more pronounced in leukemia patients. Years (1.5-3) after completion of the therapy in a significant proportion of the patients some in vitro parameters of the immune system are yet altered, so careful monitoring of this patient population is mandatory.","['Gado, Judit', 'Schlick, Barbara', 'Barany, Olga', 'Nemeth, Julia', 'Muller, Judit', 'Csoka, Monika', 'Constantin, Tamas', 'Vonnak, Eszter', 'Bocskei, Renata', 'Hauser, Peter', 'Kovacs, Gabor']","['Gado J', 'Schlick B', 'Barany O', 'Nemeth J', 'Muller J', 'Csoka M', 'Constantin T', 'Vonnak E', 'Bocskei R', 'Hauser P', 'Kovacs G']","['Semmelweis Egyetem, Altalanos Orvostudomanyi Kar, II.

CONCLUSION: Leukocytosis and RA syndrome are associated with ATO and baseline leukocyte count respectively, and there is distinct link between leukocytosis and RA syndrome.","['Jin, Bo', 'Hou, Ke-zuo', 'Liu, Yun-peng', 'Yu, Ping']","['Jin B', 'Hou KZ', 'Liu YP', 'Yu P']","['Department of Medical Oncology, the First Affiliated Hospital, China Medical University, Shenyang 110001. jinbo@csco.org.cn']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,China,Chin Med Sci J,Chinese medical sciences journal = Chung-kuo i hsueh k'o hsueh tsa chih,9112559,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (Oxides)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Dyspnea/chemically induced', 'Female', 'Fever/chemically induced', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*drug therapy', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Leukocytosis/*chemically induced', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Oxides/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Remission Induction', 'Syndrome']",,2006/11/08 09:00,2007/09/15 09:00,['2006/11/08 09:00'],"['2006/11/08 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/09/15 09:00 [medline]', '2006/11/08 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Chin Med Sci J. 2006 Sep;21(3):171-4.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is based upon differentiation of stem cells under the action of growth factors. A mathematical approach of this process is proposed to understand some blood diseases characterized by very long period oscillations in circulating blood cells. A system of three differential equations with delay, corresponding to the cell cycle duration, is proposed and analyzed. The existence of a Hopf bifurcation at a positive steady-state is obtained through the study of an exponential polynomial characteristic equation with delay-dependent coefficients. Numerical simulations show that long-period oscillations can be obtained in this model, corresponding to a destabilization of the feedback regulation between blood cells and growth factors, for reasonable cell cycle durations. These oscillations can be related to observations on some periodic hematological diseases (such as chronic myelogenous leukemia, for example).","['Adimy, Mostafa', 'Crauste, Fabien', 'Ruan, Shigui']","['Adimy M', 'Crauste F', 'Ruan S']","[""Laboratoire de Mathematiques Appliquees UMR 5142, Universite de Pau et des Pays de l'Adour, Avenue de l'universite, 64000, Pau, France. mostafa.adimy@univ-pau.fr""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",20060802,United States,Bull Math Biol,Bulletin of mathematical biology,0401404,['0 (Hematopoietic Cell Growth Factors)'],IM,"['Cell Cycle/physiology', 'Computer Simulation', 'Hematologic Diseases/*blood', 'Hematopoiesis/*physiology', 'Hematopoietic Cell Growth Factors/*physiology', 'Humans', '*Models, Biological']",,2006/11/07 09:00,2007/04/20 09:00,['2006/11/07 09:00'],"['2006/03/01 00:00 [received]', '2006/03/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2006/11/07 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/04/20 09:00 [medline]', '2006/11/07 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s11538-006-9121-9 [doi]'],ppublish,Bull Math Biol. 2006 Nov;68(8):2321-51. doi: 10.1007/s11538-006-9121-9.

Our aim was to examine whether it might similarly be used to treat glioblastoma multiforme. METHODS: The lipid-soluble active ingredients of danggui were extracted with acetone (AS-AC) or chlorophenol (AS-CH) and their antiproliferative and proapoptotic effects were studiedin vitro on cultured GBM 8401 cells and in vivoon tumors in nude mice. RESULTS: After a 24-hour treatment, either AS-AC or AS-CH at a lower (50 micro g/ml) and a higher concentration (100 micro g/ml) significantly inhibited the proliferative activity of GBM 8401 cultured cells by 30-50%, as well as the expression of cathepsin B and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). In nude mice, the growth of the tumor was inhibited by 30% by AS-CH or AS-AC (20 mg/kg; p < 0.05) and by 60% by AS-CH or AS-AC (60 mg/kg; p < 0.05). AS-AC and AS-CH also significantly inhibited microvessel formation in the tumors of nude mice. CONCLUSIONS: Danggui may inhibit tumor growth by reducing the level of VEGF and the proapoptotic protein, cathepsin B. Thus, danggui may be useful in the treatment of high-grade astrocytomas.","['Lee, Wei-Hwa', 'Jin, Jong-Shiaw', 'Tsai, Wen-Chiuan', 'Chen, Yu-Ting', 'Chang, Wen-Liang', 'Yao, Chen-Wen', 'Sheu, Lia-Fa', 'Chen, Ann']","['Lee WH', 'Jin JS', 'Tsai WC', 'Chen YT', 'Chang WL', 'Yao CW', 'Sheu LF', 'Chen A']","['Department of Pathology, Tri-Service General Hospital, National Defense Medical Center, Taipei, Taiwan, ROC.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Switzerland,Pathobiology,"Pathobiology : journal of immunopathology, molecular and cellular biology",9007504,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Drugs, Chinese Herbal)', '0 (Formazans)', '0 (Plant Extracts)', '0 (Tetrazolium Salts)', '0 (VEGFA protein, human)', '0 (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A)', '23305-68-2 (MTT formazan)', 'EC 3.4.22.1 (Cathepsin B)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Angelica sinensis/*chemistry', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Astrocytoma/blood supply/*drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Brain Neoplasms/blood supply/*drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Cathepsin B/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Drugs, Chinese Herbal/*pharmacology', 'Female', 'Formazans/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Nude', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Neovascularization, Pathologic/drug therapy/pathology', '*Phytotherapy', 'Plant Extracts/pharmacology', 'Tetrazolium Salts/metabolism', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A/metabolism']",,2006/11/07 09:00,2007/01/05 09:00,['2006/11/07 09:00'],"['2006/01/24 00:00 [received]', '2006/06/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2006/11/07 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/01/05 09:00 [medline]', '2006/11/07 09:00 [entrez]']","['95560 [pii]', '10.1159/000095560 [doi]']",ppublish,Pathobiology. 2006;73(3):141-8. doi: 10.1159/000095560.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Exposure to environmental chemicals is thought to be involved in the pathogenesis of B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL) and P-gp-transported drugs are used in its treatment; however, little is known about the impact of the C3435T MDR1 SNP in B-CLL. In this study, 110 Caucasian B-CLL patients and 201 healthy controls were genotyped for the MDR1 C3435T SNP. Additionally, P-gp activity was assessed in malignant lymphocytes of 22 untreated B-CLL patients. We observed a higher frequency of carriers of at least one 3435T allele (3435CT and 3435TT genotypes) among B-CLL patients as compared to normal individuals (76% vs . 63%, p=0.027). The genotypes 3435CT and 3435TT were associated with B-CLL, (odds ratio=1.8, 95% confidence interval = 1.1-3.0). Moreover, P-gp activity in B-CLL cells depended on MDR1 genotype, with the highest P-gp activity in 3435CC homozygotes, intermediate in 3435CT heterozygotes and the lowest in 3435TT homozygotes (p=0.042). P-gp activity was also significantly lower in carriers of the T-allele (3435CT/TT genotype) as compared to the non-carriers (3435CC genotype), (p=0.029). Taken together, these data indicate that the MDR1 C3435T SNP may carry an increased risk of developing B-CLL, possibly by virtue of decreased protection against P-gp-substrate carcinogens. The differences in P-gp activity in B-CLL tumor cells related to MDR1 genotype may have implications to the response to chemotherapy with P-gp transported anticancer agents.","['Jamroziak, Krzysztof', 'Balcerczak, Ewa', 'Smolewski, Piotr', 'Robey, Robert W', 'Cebula, Barbara', 'Panczyk, Mariusz', 'Kowalczyk, Monika', 'Szmigielska-Kaplon, Anna', 'Mirowski, Marek', 'Bates, Susan E', 'Robak, Tadeusz']","['Jamroziak K', 'Balcerczak E', 'Smolewski P', 'Robey RW', 'Cebula B', 'Panczyk M', 'Kowalczyk M', 'Szmigielska-Kaplon A', 'Mirowski M', 'Bates SE', 'Robak T']","['Department of Hematology, Medical University of Lodz,, Ciolkowskiego 2, PL 93-510 Lodz, Poland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Switzerland,Pharmacol Rep,Pharmacological reports : PR,101234999,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Drug Resistance, Multiple/genetics', 'Female', '*Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Polymorphism, Genetic']",,2006/11/07 09:00,2007/03/28 09:00,['2006/11/07 09:00'],"['2006/01/09 00:00 [received]', '2006/07/24 00:00 [revised]', '2006/11/07 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/03/28 09:00 [medline]', '2006/11/07 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Pharmacol Rep. 2006 Sep-Oct;58(5):720-8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Inhibition of LPAAT-beta induces growth arrest and apoptosis in cancer cell lines, implicating LPAAT-beta as a potential drug target in neoplasia. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: In this study, we investigated the effects of CT32228, a specific LPAAT-beta inhibitor, on BCR-ABL-transformed cell lines and primary cells from patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia. RESULTS: CT32228 had antiproliferative activity against BCR-ABL-positive cell lines in the nanomolar dose range, evidenced by cell cycle arrest in G2-M and induction of apoptosis. Treatment of K562 cells with CT32228 led to inhibition of extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 phosphorylation, consistent with inhibition of mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling. Importantly, CT32228 was highly active in cell lines resistant to the Bcr-Abl kinase inhibitor imatinib. Combination of CT32228 with imatinib produced additive inhibition of proliferation in cell lines with residual sensitivity toward imatinib. In short-term cultures in the absence of growth factors, CT32228 preferentially inhibited the growth of granulocyte-macrophage colony-forming units from chronic myelogenous leukemia patients compared with healthy controls.

EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We monitored late events and causes of death over 15 years (median follow-up, 120 months) in 120 patients with nonbulky stage IA-IIA Hodgkin's lymphoma, treated with four cycles of ABVD and limited radiotherapy. Pulmonary and cardiac function tests were done throughout the follow-up. Outcome measures included cause-specific mortality, standardized mortality ratio, and standardized incidence ratio for secondary neoplasia. RESULTS: Projected 15-year event-free and overall survival were 78% and 86%, and tumor mortality was 3%. Standardized mortality ratio was significantly higher than 1 for both males (2.8; P=0.029) and females (9.4; P=0.003). The risk of cardiovascular events at 5 and 12 years was 5.5% and 14%, with a median latent time of 67 months (range: 23-179 months) from the end of radiotherapy. Pulmonary toxicity developed in 8% of patients; all had received mediastinal irradiation and the median time from radiotherapy to pulmonary sequelae was 76 weeks (range: 50-123 weeks). The risk of secondary neoplasia at 5 and 12 years was 4% and 8%, respectively, with no cases of leukemia. Fertility was preserved. CONCLUSIONS: Long-term events were mostly related to radiotherapy; the role of short ABVD chemotherapy was very limited, as documented by fertility preservation and lack of secondary myelodysplasia/leukemia. A proportion of patients died from causes unrelated to disease progression and the excess mortality risk was mostly due to the occurrence of secondary neoplasms and cardiovascular diseases.

We developed a fusion protein consisting of the ligand binding domains of the IL-6 receptor subunits IL-6Ralpha and gp130 that acts as a highly potent IL-6 inhibitor. Gp130 is a shared cytokine receptor also used by the IL-6-related cytokines oncostatin M and leukemia inhibitory factor. In this study, we have shown that the IL-6 receptor fusion protein (IL-6-RFP) is a specific IL-6 inhibitor that does not block oncostatin M or leukemia inhibitory factor. We characterized the complex of IL-6-RFP and fluorescently labeled IL-6 (YFPIL-6) by blue native PAGE and gel filtration. A 2-fold molar excess of IL-6-RFP over IL-6 was sufficient to entirely bind IL-6 in a complex with IL-6-RFP. As shown by treatment with urea and binding competition experiments, the complex of IL-6 and IL-6-RFP is more stable than the complex of IL-6, soluble IL-6Ralpha, and soluble gp130. By live cell imaging, we have demonstrated that YFP-IL-6 bound to the surface of cells expressing gp130-CFP is removed from the plasma membrane upon the addition of IL-6-RFP. The apparent molecular mass of the IL-6.IL-6-RFP complex determined by blue native PAGE and gel filtration suggests that IL-6 is trapped in a structure analogous to the native hexameric IL-6 receptor complex.

Presence of this antigen also predicts response to immunosuppressive treatment. If DR15 expression on hematopoietic cells also favors induction of immune responses in an allogeneic setting, a lower relapse rate after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) might result through an enhanced graft-versus-leukemia effect. We retrospectively analyzed outcome of HLA-identical sibling HSCT in 192 consecutive patients with acute or chronic leukemia or non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Patients carrying the DR15 antigen had a higher estimated 5-year overall survival (76%) than did DR15-negative patients (55%; P = .04). Improved survival for DR15 patients was due to a significant decrease in death from relapse (5% for DR15(+) versus 24% for DR15(-); P = .02), whereas no difference was seen for rates of transplant-related mortality (19% and 21%, respectively; P = .76). Findings were confirmed by multivariate analyses. Our results show an association of DR15 with a decreased risk of disease relapse and improved survival after HSCT for leukemia or non-Hodgkin lymphoma.

In this analysis, we report the outcomes of 46 patients with advanced CLL who underwent nonmyeloablative stem cell transplantation (NST) from HLA-matched unrelated (67%) or related (33%) donors. Fludarabine (30 mg/m2 x 4) and low-dose intravenous busulfan (0.8 mg/kg/day x 4) were used for conditioning. The 2-year overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) rates in this refractory patient population were 54% and 34%, respectively, with a median follow-up of 20 months. The primary cause of treatment failure was relapse, with a 2-year cumulative incidence of 48%. High hematopoietic donor chimerism > or = 75% at day +30 was a significant predictor of 2-year PFS (47% vs 11%; P = .03). In multivariate analysis, chemotherapy-refractory disease at transplantation was associated with a 3.2-fold risk of progression (P = .01) and a 4.6-fold risk of death (P = .02). Increasing number of previous therapies and increasing bone marrow involvement were also associated with decreased PFS and OS. These results suggest that NST using fludarabine and low-dose intravenous busulfan is a reasonable treatment option for patients with advanced CLL, but that NST earlier in the disease course will likely be needed to achieve long-term disease control in a high proportion of patients.","['Brown, Jennifer R', 'Kim, Haesook T', 'Li, Shuli', 'Stephans, Katherine', 'Fisher, David C', 'Cutler, Corey', 'Ho, Vincent', 'Lee, Stephanie J', 'Milford, Edgar L', 'Ritz, Jerome', 'Antin, Joseph H', 'Soiffer, Robert J', 'Gribben, John G', 'Alyea, Edwin P']","['Brown JR', 'Kim HT', 'Li S', 'Stephans K', 'Fisher DC', 'Cutler C', 'Ho V', 'Lee SJ', 'Milford EL', 'Ritz J', 'Antin JH', 'Soiffer RJ', 'Gribben JG', 'Alyea EP']","['Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA 02115, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Biol Blood Marrow Transplant,Biology of blood and marrow transplantation : journal of the American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation,9600628,"['0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'G1LN9045DK (Busulfan)', 'P2K93U8740 (fludarabine)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Busulfan/administration & dosage', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Graft Survival', 'Graft vs Host Disease/epidemiology/etiology/prevention & control', 'Graft vs Leukemia Effect', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/adverse effects', 'Humans', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/therapeutic use', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/drug therapy/mortality/*surgery', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Survival Rate', 'Transplantation Conditioning/methods', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Vidarabine/administration & dosage/analogs & derivatives']",,2006/11/07 09:00,2007/03/21 09:00,['2006/11/07 09:00'],"['2006/04/28 00:00 [received]', '2006/06/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2006/11/07 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/03/21 09:00 [medline]', '2006/11/07 09:00 [entrez]']","['S1083-8791(06)00406-X [pii]', '10.1016/j.bbmt.2006.06.004 [doi]']",ppublish,Biol Blood Marrow Transplant. 2006 Oct;12(10):1056-64. doi: 10.1016/j.bbmt.2006.06.004.,,,,,,,"['A129530/PHS HHS/United States', 'K23 CA115682-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA81538/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 HL070149/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,

To date, such altered HLA expression has not been studied extensively in freshly isolated leukemic blasts. If it occurs, leukemic cells could escape T-cell surveillance as a consequence. Genotypes of nine leukemic cell lines were determined using a polymerase chain reaction for HLA classes I and II. Cells were also examined for HLA beta2-microglobulin, and allele-specific HLA protein expression using flow cytometry. Next, 44 samples of freshly isolated leukemic blasts from 43 patients with malignant hematological diseases were examined for allele-specific HLA expression using flow cytometry. Microsatellite analysis was performed to determine heterozygosity in the HLA region on chromosome 6. Genotype analysis for HLA class I together with microsatellite analysis demonstrated loss of HLA haplotype in HL-60 cells. No loss of HLA haplotype was observed in 44 samples of freshly isolated leukemic blasts. As reported previously, flow cytometric analysis rarely demonstrated loss or down-regulation of HLA expression at initial diagnosis (3/39; 7.7%); however, this was evident in two of five cases in relapse (40.0%), which contrasts with previous reports. In one patient with acute leukemia, HLA-A2 cell surface expression was present at initial diagnosis, lost at relapse, and completely restored after 48 h of culture in the presence of interferon-gamma. These results suggest loss of allele-specific HLA expression may be involved in the pathogenesis of relapse in patients with leukemia. The findings should be valuable in designing new strategies for clinical immunotherapy.","['Masuda, Kozo', 'Hiraki, Akio', 'Fujii, Nobuharu', 'Watanabe, Toshiyuki', 'Tanaka, Motoyuki', 'Matsue, Kosei', 'Ogama, Yoichiro', 'Ouchida, Mamoru', 'Shimizu, Kenji', 'Ikeda, Kazuma', 'Tanimoto, Mitsune']","['Masuda K', 'Hiraki A', 'Fujii N', 'Watanabe T', 'Tanaka M', 'Matsue K', 'Ogama Y', 'Ouchida M', 'Shimizu K', 'Ikeda K', 'Tanimoto M']","['Department of Medicine, Okayama University Graduate School of Medicine and Dentistry, Okayama, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,England,Cancer Sci,Cancer science,101168776,['0 (Histocompatibility Antigens Class I)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Blast Crisis/genetics', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Down-Regulation', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Gene Expression', 'Genotype', 'Haplotypes', 'Histocompatibility Antigens Class I/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Humans', '*Loss of Heterozygosity', 'Lymphoproliferative Disorders/*genetics', 'Male', 'Microsatellite Repeats', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local/*genetics', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction']",,2006/11/07 09:00,2007/05/05 09:00,['2006/11/07 09:00'],"['2006/11/07 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/05/05 09:00 [medline]', '2006/11/07 09:00 [entrez]']","['CAS356 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1349-7006.2006.00356.x [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Sci. 2007 Jan;98(1):102-8. doi: 10.1111/j.1349-7006.2006.00356.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Cytological impressions from the eyes of nine allografted patients (17 eyes) were analysed. Donor cells were identified using sex-chromosome-specific fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). Cells were characterized by immunohistochemistry (IHC) using the CK3 and CK19 epithelial markers, the panleucocytic marker CD45 and the myofibroblast marker alpha-SMA. RESULTS: No epithelial cells of donor origin were observed in the corneal or conjunctival samples. Cells of donor origin were found in the corneal samples, although these were often too degraded to allow characterization by IHC. In the conjunctiva, a median of 86% of the total number of cells were of recipient origin, including a subgroup (2%) of giant cells exhibiting polyploidy (range 4-18 n), found in the limbal region.

A total of 375 patients, up to 65 years old, were randomised between fludarabine or FC for first line therapy. No routine anti-infective prophylaxis was provided. A total of 196 infectious episodes, including 33 severe infections, were documented. In the fludarabine arm, 32.9% of the patients developed an infectious complication compared with 39.9% in the FC arm (P = 0.2). No difference was observed in the rate of severe infections (Common Toxicity Criteria grades III and IV) between both treatment arms. Dose reductions were performed more frequently in FC-treated patients. Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) was administered due to leucopenia in 5% of all patients. A multivariate regression model identified only elevated thymidine kinase, but not the treatment arm, as a statistically independent risk factor for infections. In summary, FC was not associated with a higher rate of infections compared with fludarabine alone. No routine antibiotic or virostatic prophylaxis, or preemptive treatment with G-CSF, is necessary in first line therapy with fludarabine-based regimens in younger patients with CLL, if adequate dose reduction is performed.

Here, we demonstrate that expression levels of HATs, p300 and CBP [CREB (cAMP-response-element-binding protein)-binding protein] were decreased during chemical hepatocarcinogenesis, whereas expression of MOZ (monocytic leukaemia zinc-finger protein; MYST3)--a member of the MYST [MOZ, Ybf2/Sas3, Sas2 and TIP60 (Tat-interacting protein, 60 kDa)] acetyltransferase family--was induced. Although the MOZ gene frequently is rearranged in leukaemia, we were unable to detect MOZ rearrangement in livers with hyperplastic nodules. We examined the effect of MOZ on hepatocarcinogenic-specific gene expression. GSTP (glutathione S-transferase placental form) is a Phase II detoxification enzyme and a well-known tumour marker that is specifically elevated during hepatocarcinogenesis. GSTP gene activation is regulated mainly by the GPE1 (GSTP enhancer 1) enhancer element, which is recognized by the Nrf2 (nuclear factor-erythroid 2 p45 subunit-related factor 2)-MafK heterodimer. We found that MOZ enhances GSTP promoter activity through GPE1 and acts as a co-activator of the Nrf2-MafK heterodimer. Further, exogenous MOZ induced GSTP expression in rat hepatoma H4IIE cells. These results suggest that during early hepatocarcinogenesis, aberrantly expressed MOZ may induce GSTP expression through the Nrf2-mediated pathway.","['Ohta, Kumiko', 'Ohigashi, Megumi', 'Naganawa, Ayako', 'Ikeda, Hiromi', 'Sakai, Masaharu', 'Nishikawa, Jun-ichi', 'Imagawa, Masayoshi', 'Osada, Shigehiro', 'Nishihara, Tsutomu']","['Ohta K', 'Ohigashi M', 'Naganawa A', 'Ikeda H', 'Sakai M', 'Nishikawa J', 'Imagawa M', 'Osada S', 'Nishihara T']","['Laboratory of Environmental Biochemistry, Graduate School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Osaka University, 1-6 Yamada-Oka, Suita, Osaka 565-0871, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Biochem J,The Biochemical journal,2984726R,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Proteins)', '0 (MafK Transcription Factor)', '0 (NF-E2-Related Factor 2)', 'EC 2.3.1.48 (Histone Acetyltransferases)', 'EC 2.3.1.48 (Kat6a protein, rat)', 'EC 2.5.1.18 (Glutathione S-Transferase pi)']",IM,"['Animals', '*Biomarkers, Tumor', 'CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Proteins/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Dimerization', '*Gene Expression', 'Glutathione S-Transferase pi/genetics/metabolism', 'Histone Acetyltransferases/genetics/*metabolism', 'Liver Neoplasms/*enzymology/genetics/*pathology', 'MafK Transcription Factor/genetics/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'NF-E2-Related Factor 2/genetics/*metabolism', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/genetics', 'Protein Binding', 'Rats']",,2006/11/07 09:00,2007/03/21 09:00,['2006/11/07 09:00'],"['2006/11/07 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/03/21 09:00 [medline]', '2006/11/07 09:00 [entrez]']","['BJ20061194 [pii]', '10.1042/BJ20061194 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem J. 2007 Mar 15;402(3):559-66. doi: 10.1042/BJ20061194.,,,,,PMC1863558,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the present study, we sought to identify novel C/EBPalpha interacting proteins in vivo through immunoprecipitation using mass spectrometry-based proteomic techniques. We identified Max, a heterodimeric partner of Myc, as one of the interacting proteins of C/EBPalpha in our screen. We confirmed the in vivo interaction of C/EBPalpha with Max and showed that this interaction involves the basic region of C/EBPalpha. Endogenous C/EBPalpha and Max, but not Myc and Max, colocalize in intranuclear structures during granulocytic differentiation of myeloid U937 cells. Max enhanced the transactivation capacity of C/EBPalpha on a minimal promoter. A chromatin immunoprecipitation assay revealed occupancy of the human C/EBPalpha promoter in vivo by Max and Myc under cellular settings and by C/EBPalpha and Max under retinoic acid induced granulocytic differentiation. Interestingly, enforced expression of Max and C/EBPalpha results in granulocytic differentiation of the human hematopoietic CD34(+) cells, as evidenced by CD11b, CD15 and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor receptor expression. Silencing of Max by short hairpin RNA in CD34(+) and U937 cells strongly reduced the differentiation-inducing potential of C/EBPalpha, indicating the importance of C/EBPalpha-Max in myeloid progenitor differentiation. Taken together, our data reveal Max as a novel co-activator of C/EBPalpha functions, thereby suggesting a possible link between C/EBPalpha and Myc-Max-Mad network.","['Zada, A A', 'Pulikkan, J A', 'Bararia, D', 'Geletu, M', 'Trivedi, A K', 'Balkhi, M Y', 'Hiddemann, W D', 'Tenen, D G', 'Behre, H M', 'Behre, G']","['Zada AA', 'Pulikkan JA', 'Bararia D', 'Geletu M', 'Trivedi AK', 'Balkhi MY', 'Hiddemann WD', 'Tenen DG', 'Behre HM', 'Behre G']","['Bone Marrow Transplantation Unit, State Center for Cell and Gene Therapy, Clinic Internal Medicine IV, Martin-Luther-University, Halle, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20061102,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Leucine Zipper Transcription Factors)', '0 (CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Protein-alpha)', '0 (MAX protein, human)', '0 (MXD1 protein, human)', '0 (MYC protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.1.21 (Thymidine Kinase)']",IM,"['Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Leucine Zipper Transcription Factors/analysis/*physiology', 'CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Protein-alpha/analysis/chemistry/*physiology', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Dimerization', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology', 'Humans', '*Leukopoiesis', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', '*Proteomics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc/analysis/*physiology', 'RNA, Small Interfering/pharmacology', 'Repressor Proteins/*physiology', 'Thymidine Kinase/genetics']",,2006/11/04 09:00,2007/09/21 09:00,['2006/11/04 09:00'],"['2006/11/04 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/09/21 09:00 [medline]', '2006/11/04 09:00 [entrez]']","['2404438 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.leu.2404438 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2006 Dec;20(12):2137-46. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2404438.

The absorption and permeation of oral D-Xylose, lactulose and mannitol were measured weekly from baseline until marrow recovery in adult recipients of idarubicin plus cytarabine for untreated acute myeloid leukaemia. These studies were correlated with non-haematologic chemotherapy-related toxicities reflecting mucosal damage, including nausea, vomiting, stomatitis, diarrhoea, abdominal pain and systemic infection. D-xylose absorption decreased and lactulose:mannitol ratio reflecting intestinal permeability increased from baseline until the second and third week after the beginning of the treatment followed by recovery. These measures correlated with infection rates, nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea and increased blood product utilization. Lisofylline was associated with increased intestinal permeability, nausea, vomiting and infection-related morbidity despite a reduction in the duration of neutropaenia. These surrogates of intestinal barrier function correlated well with clinically important outcomes despite the failure to demonstrate reduced morbidity with lisofylline and represent useful objective outcome measurements for future clinical trials of products for the amelioration of the effects of cytotoxic therapy on the intestinal mucosa.","['Bow, E J', 'Meddings, J B']","['Bow EJ', 'Meddings JB']","['Department of Internal Medicine and Medical Microbiology, The University of Manitoba, Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada. ebow@hsc.mb.ca']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20061102,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', 'A1TA934AKO (Xylose)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*adverse effects', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infections/*etiology', 'Intestinal Absorption/drug effects', 'Intestinal Mucosa/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prospective Studies', 'Remission Induction', 'Xylose/blood']",,2006/11/04 09:00,2007/09/21 09:00,['2006/11/04 09:00'],"['2006/11/04 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/09/21 09:00 [medline]', '2006/11/04 09:00 [entrez]']","['2404440 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.leu.2404440 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2006 Dec;20(12):2087-92. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2404440.

We evaluated ZAP-70 expression in 156 CLL patients by immunohistochemistry (IHC) on formalin-fixed bone marrow (BM) biopsies at diagnosis. At presentation, 117 patients (75%) were with Binet stage A, 27 (17%) stage B and 12 (8%) stage C. Median follow-up was 61 months (range 6-242). ZAP-70 was expressed in neoplastic lymphocytes of 69 patients (44%). Concordance between ZAP-70 by IHC and ZAP-70 by FC, immunoglobulin heavy chain variable genes (IGHV) mutational status and CD38 expression was found in 41/46 (89%), 41/49 (80%) and in 60/88 (68%) tested cases, respectively. ZAP-70 expression significantly correlated with advanced Binet stage (B-C), diffuse BM infiltration, increased lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and beta2-microglobulin serum levels and lymphocyte doubling time <12 months. ZAP-70 positivity was significantly related to poorer time to progression (median 16 months vs 158 of ZAP-70-negative cases) (P<0.0001) and overall survival (median 106 months vs not reached) (P=0.0002); this correlation was confirmed at multivariate analysis.

After completion of the full RTX infusion, substantial recrudescence of CLL cells occurs, and these cells have lost > 90% of CD20. To gain insight into mechanism(s) of CD20 loss, we investigated the hypothesis that thrice-weekly low-dose RTX (20 or 60 mg/m2) treatment for CLL over 4 wk would preserve CD20 and enhance leukemic cell clearance. During initial infusions in all 12 patients, the first 30 mg of RTX promoted clearance of > 75% leukemic cells. Four of six patients receiving 20 mg/m2 RTX retained > or = 50% CD20, and additional RTX infusions promoted further cell clearance. However, four of six patients receiving 60 mg/m2 had CD20 levels < 20% baseline 2 days after initial infusions, and additional RTX infusions were less effective, presumably due to epitope loss. Our results suggest that when a threshold RTX dose is exceeded, recrudesced RTX-opsonized cells are not cleared, due to saturation of the mononuclear phagocytic system, but instead are shaved of RTX-CD20 complexes by acceptor cells. Thrice-weekly low-dose RTX may promote enhanced clearance of circulating CLL cells by preserving CD20.","['Williams, Michael E', 'Densmore, John J', 'Pawluczkowycz, Andrew W', 'Beum, Paul V', 'Kennedy, Adam D', 'Lindorfer, Margaret A', 'Hamil, Susan H', 'Eggleton, Jane C', 'Taylor, Ronald P']","['Williams ME', 'Densmore JJ', 'Pawluczkowycz AW', 'Beum PV', 'Kennedy AD', 'Lindorfer MA', 'Hamil SH', 'Eggleton JC', 'Taylor RP']","['Hematology/Oncology Division and Hematologic Malignancy Program, University of Virginia Health System, Charlottesville, VA 22908-0733, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived)', '0 (Antigens, CD20)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Complement C3)', '4F4X42SYQ6 (Rituximab)']",IM,"['Administration, Oral', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/*administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived', 'Antigens, CD20/*blood', 'Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Complement C3/metabolism', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Immunologic', 'Drug Administration Schedule', '*Drug Delivery Systems', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infusions, Intravenous', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/blood/*immunology/*therapy', 'Lymphocyte Count', 'Lymphocyte Depletion', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Rituximab']",,2006/11/04 09:00,2007/01/06 09:00,['2006/11/04 09:00'],"['2006/11/04 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/01/06 09:00 [medline]', '2006/11/04 09:00 [entrez]']","['177/10/7435 [pii]', '10.4049/jimmunol.177.10.7435 [doi]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 2006 Nov 15;177(10):7435-43. doi: 10.4049/jimmunol.177.10.7435.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
