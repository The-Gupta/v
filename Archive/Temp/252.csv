Previous work [Zwelling et al., Biochemistry 20, 6553 (1981)] had shown that m-AMSA is in rapid equilibrium between extracellular and intracellular compartments, and that the DNA strand breaks exist in a steady state of rapid formation and resealing. The current work reports an unusual uptake phenomenon of m-AMSA by mouse leukemia L1210 cells that occurs at higher drug concentrations than previously studied. The new uptake phenomenon was characterized by cooperativity, hysteresis, irreversibility, saturability, slowness and temperature dependence. It is concluded that m-AMSA concentrations above a critical value can initiate the irreversible sequestration of m-AMSA into a new phase, probably in an extranuclear compartment of the cell, from which the drug has no access to the nuclear DNA and probably does not contribute to cytotoxicity.","['Zwelling, L A', 'Kerrigan, D', 'Michaels, S', 'Kohn, K W']","['Zwelling LA', 'Kerrigan D', 'Michaels S', 'Kohn KW']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Biochem Pharmacol,Biochemical pharmacology,0101032,"['0 (Aminoacridines)', '0 (Azides)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Intercalating Agents)', '00DPD30SOY (Amsacrine)']",IM,"['Allosteric Regulation', 'Aminoacridines/*metabolism', 'Amsacrine', 'Animals', 'Azides/pharmacology', 'Cell Nucleus/metabolism', 'Cells, Cultured', 'DNA, Neoplasm/metabolism', 'Energy Metabolism/drug effects', 'Hydrogen-Ion Concentration', 'Intercalating Agents/pharmacology', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia L1210/*metabolism', 'Mice']",1982/10/15 00:00,1982/10/15 00:01,['1982/10/15 00:00'],"['1982/10/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1982/10/15 00:01 [medline]', '1982/10/15 00:00 [entrez]']","['0006-2952(82)90561-5 [pii]', '10.1016/0006-2952(82)90561-5 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Pharmacol. 1982 Oct 15;31(20):3269-77. doi: 10.1016/0006-2952(82)90561-5.,,,,,,,,,,,,

The results have been compared with previously published in vivo antitumor activity and physicochemical properties related to DNA binding, acridine base strength, stability to chemical attack by thiols, and lipophilicity. Multiple-parameter regression equations show that both dose potency and host toxicity in mice are related to a combination of in vitro activity and a nonlinear (quadratic) term in lipophilicity. The in vitro activity can in turn be modeled as a combination of terms representing DNA binding, ability to quench the fluorescence of DNA-bound ethidium stability to thiolysis, and lipophilicity. It is hypothesized that the terms for thiolytic stability and lipophilic-hydrophilic balance describe the availability of the drug to the cell, and that the DNA binding constant determines what proportion of the available drug is bound to DNA, the proposed target site. The remaining terms could reflect changes in the geometry of drug-DNA binding, which in turn affect the intrinsic activity of these drugs when bound at their site of action.","['Baguley, B C', 'Cain, B F']","['Baguley BC', 'Cain BF']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Mol Pharmacol,Molecular pharmacology,0035623,"['0 (Aminoacridines)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '00DPD30SOY (Amsacrine)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",IM,"['Aminoacridines/*pharmacology', 'Amsacrine', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'DNA/metabolism', 'Half-Life', 'Leukemia, Experimental/drug therapy', 'Mice', 'Regression Analysis']",1982/09/01 00:00,1982/09/01 00:01,['1982/09/01 00:00'],"['1982/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1982/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1982/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Mol Pharmacol. 1982 Sep;22(2):486-92.,,,,,,,,,,,,

The process by which transferrin-bound Ga is converted to tumor-bound Ga is not fully understood, but may involve the differential physiology of neoplasms compared with normal tissues. Based on the slight acidity known to be exhibited by the extracellular fluid of many animal and human tumors, we have studied the effect of pH on stability and dissociation of the Ga-transferrin complex and on the uptake of Ga by tumor cells in vitro and animal tumors in vivo. When plasma from rabbits injection 67Ga-citrate was dialyzed at pH 6.5-7.5, dissociation of Ga from transferrin showed an inverse pH-dependence. A similar inverse dependence on pH was observed for the uptake of Ga by L1210 leukemia cells and Ehrlich ascites cells incubated with Ga-transferrin complex. Tumor uptake of Ga in rats bearing Walker-256 carcinosarcoma or Murphystum lymphosarcoma whose tumor pH had been further lowered by administration of glucose showed a statistically significant increase over control rats receiving no glucose. These results demonstrate that the stability of the Ga-transferrin complex is pH-dependent and suggest that dissociation of this complex due to decreased pH at the tumor site may be one factor involved in tumor localization and binding of Ga.","['Vallabhajosula, S R', 'Harwig, J F', 'Wolf, W']","['Vallabhajosula SR', 'Harwig JF', 'Wolf W']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Germany,Eur J Nucl Med,European journal of nuclear medicine,7606882,"['0 (Gallium Radioisotopes)', '0 (Transferrin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Carcinoma 256, Walker/metabolism', 'Carcinoma, Ehrlich Tumor/metabolism', 'Cell Survival', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Gallium Radioisotopes/*metabolism', 'Hydrogen-Ion Concentration', 'Leukemia L1210/metabolism', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/metabolism', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred DBA', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Neoplasms/*metabolism', 'Rabbits', 'Rats', 'Transferrin/*metabolism']",1982/01/01 00:00,1982/01/01 00:01,['1982/01/01 00:00'],"['1982/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1982/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1982/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF00253083 [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Nucl Med. 1982;7(10):462-8. doi: 10.1007/BF00253083.,"['5 PO1 CA 19438/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', '5 RO1 21273/PHS HHS/United States', '5 SO7 RR 05466 13/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,

Sequence analysis of this clone has shown that at least 65 nucleotides at the 5' end of 7S RNA are extensively homologous with the highly repeated mouse B1 family. Heterologous hybridisations between the cloned mouse 7S sequence and RNAs prepared from rat, human and chick cells have shown that the non-B1 part of the 7S RNA molecule has been highly conserved during recent eucaryotic evolution. There are multiple copies of 7S RNA genes in the genomes of mouse, human, rat and chick cells, but substantial differences exist in copy number and genomic organisation in these organisms.","['Balmain, A', 'Krumlauf, R', 'Vass, J K', 'Birnie, G D']","['Balmain A', 'Krumlauf R', 'Vass JK', 'Birnie GD']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Nucleic Acids Res,Nucleic acids research,0411011,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (RNA, Ribosomal)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', '*Cloning, Molecular', 'Cytoplasm/metabolism', '*DNA', 'DNA, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Leukemia, Experimental/genetics', 'Mice', 'Molecular Weight', 'Nucleic Acid Hybridization', 'Polyribosomes/analysis', 'RNA, Neoplasm/*genetics', 'RNA, Ribosomal/*genetics']",1982/07/24 00:00,1982/07/24 00:01,['1982/07/24 00:00'],"['1982/07/24 00:00 [pubmed]', '1982/07/24 00:01 [medline]', '1982/07/24 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/nar/10.14.4259 [doi]'],ppublish,Nucleic Acids Res. 1982 Jul 24;10(14):4259-77. doi: 10.1093/nar/10.14.4259.,,,['GENBANK/X04211'],PMC320798,,,,,,,,

Patients entered remission after 2-5 weekly cycles of vincristine-daunorubicin (day 1) followed by sequential cytosine arabinoside and 6-azauridine (days 4-7). With continuation therapy of monthly vincristine-doxorubicin-cyclophosphamide, weekly cytosine arabinoside, and daily 6-mercaptopurine, the median duration of complete remission was 10 mo and the median survival time 21 mo. Portal triaditis, evident in 11 of 23 patients with liver biopsies, was associated with long remissions. A larger spleen size (greater than 5 cm) and a higher myeloblast labeling index (greater than 10%) at diagnosis were clearly related to shorter durations of remission. Splenectomy within 1 mo of remission had no statistically significant effect on the frequency of relapse or length of remission. Patients without central nervous system (CNS) leukemia at diagnosis, all treated prophylactically with intrathecal methotrexate, had a low frequency of initial CNS relapse (3/56, 5%). The 2-yr disease-free survival rate is 29% (20 of 68 patients attaining complete remission). fifteen patients have completed 2.5 yr of therapy, and each remains in continuous complete remission, off treatment, for 1+ -36+ mo.

DBI was found to increase markedly the inhibitory effect of either 4,4'-diacetyldiphenylurea-bis(guanylhydrazone) or MGBG on respiration of isolated rat liver mitochondria. Conversely, these bis(guanylhydrazones) enhanced the inhibitory potency of DBI and increased the apparent affinity of mitochondria for the drug. As with MGBG and 4,4'-diacetyldiphenylurea-bis(guanylhydrazone), the potassium cationophore, valinomycin, increased the sensitivity of mitochondrial respiration to DBI. It is suggested that the enhancement of bis(guanylhydrazone) inhibition of mitochondrial respiration by DBI involves inhibition of proton fluxes across the inner mitochondrial membrane and the subsequent alkalinization of the mitochondrial matrix. This drug interaction was extended to the level of antiproliferative activity in which DBI was found to potentiate the growth-inhibitory effects of MGBG on murine L1210 leukemia in vivo.","['Byczkowski, J Z', 'Zychlinski, L', 'Porter, C W']","['Byczkowski JZ', 'Zychlinski L', 'Porter CW']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Carbanilides)', '0 (Guanidines)', '0 (Polyamines)', '13284-07-6 (diacetyldiphenylurea bisguanylhydrazone)', '2001-95-8 (Valinomycin)', 'DD5K7529CE (Phenformin)', 'OD5Q0L447W (Mitoguazone)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Carbanilides/*pharmacology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Synergism', 'Guanidines/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia L1210/*drug therapy', 'Mitochondria, Liver/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Mitoguazone/*pharmacology', 'Oxygen Consumption/drug effects', 'Phenformin/*pharmacology', 'Polyamines/pharmacology', 'Rats', 'Valinomycin/pharmacology']",1982/09/01 00:00,1982/09/01 00:01,['1982/09/01 00:00'],"['1982/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1982/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1982/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1982 Sep;42(9):3592-5.,"['CA-22153/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-24538/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,

Many of the 5-iminodaunorubicin breaks measured in this assay may arise from apposed single-strand breaks (i.e., double-strand breaks). 5-Iminodaunorubicin produced breaks which disappeared within 1 to 2 hr following drug removal and were in this way similar to the breaks produced by the acridine intercalator 4'-(9-acridinylamino)methanesulfon-m-anisidide. Adriamycin produced more persistent breaks. Despite similarities in the kinetics of break disappearance, 5-iminodaunorubicin produced greater cytotoxicity than did 4'-(9-acridinylamino)methanesulfon-m-anisidide when compared at doses producing equal single-strand or double-strand breaks. Differences in the ratio of single-strand breaks to double-strand breaks and the associated cytotoxicity for 5-iminodaunorubicin and 4'-(9-acridinylamino)methanesulfon-m-anisidide indicate that a different mechanism is probably involved in the DNA break production by each agent. Differences between the cytotoxicity associated with the DNA break production by two agents with similar break disappearance kinetics indicate that intercalator-induced DNA breaks cannot be a uniformly lethal DNA lesion.","['Zwelling, L A', 'Kerrigan, D', 'Michaels, S']","['Zwelling LA', 'Kerrigan D', 'Michaels S']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Aminoacridines)', '00DPD30SOY (Amsacrine)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'P910685S6G (5-iminodaunorubicin)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,"['Aminoacridines/*pharmacology', 'Amsacrine', 'Animals', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', '*DNA', 'Daunorubicin/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Doxorubicin/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia L1210/*metabolism/physiopathology', 'Mice']",1982/07/01 00:00,1982/07/01 00:01,['1982/07/01 00:00'],"['1982/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1982/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1982/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1982 Jul;42(7):2687-91.,,,,,,,,,,,,

(1981) J. Mol.

The DHF reductase gene in these cells is amplified about 350-fold as a result of selection for resistance to methotrexate. Dramatic overproduction of DHF reductase mRNA in L5178Y-R cells suggests that most of the DHF reductase genes in these cells are transcribed. We report that all major mononucleosomal species resolvable by two-dimensional fractionation are detected by both DHF reductase- and satellite DNA-specific hybridization probes. Although the DHF reductase and satellite hybridization patterns differ somewhat from each other and from the total mononucleosomal pattern, their overall similarity is very high. In particular, no large differences in the abundance of mononucleosomes containing high mobility group non-histone proteins (HMG) 14 and 17 are seen between the DHF reductase and satellite chromatin regions under a wide variety of conditions for chromatin isolation, digestion, and fractionation. Possible interpretations of the apparent lack of selectivity of HMG-chromatin interactions in this system are discussed. We also found that the amplified DHF reductase genes possess a wide range of nucleosomal repeat lengths close to that in the bulk chromatin. In contrast, the range of nucleosomal repeat lengths in the satellite chromatin is much narrower than in both DHF reductase and bulk chromatin.","['Barsoum, J', 'Levinger, L', 'Varshavsky, A']","['Barsoum J', 'Levinger L', 'Varshavsky A']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Chromatin)', '0 (Nucleosomes)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 1.5.1.3 (Tetrahydrofolate Dehydrogenase)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chromatin/analysis/*metabolism', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'DNA/metabolism', 'Drug Resistance', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', '*Genes', 'Leukemia L5178/*enzymology', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*enzymology', 'Methotrexate/pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Nucleic Acid Hybridization', 'Nucleosomes/metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Tetrahydrofolate Dehydrogenase/*genetics', '*Transcription, Genetic']",1982/05/10 00:00,1982/05/10 00:01,['1982/05/10 00:00'],"['1982/05/10 00:00 [pubmed]', '1982/05/10 00:01 [medline]', '1982/05/10 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0021-9258(18)34667-2 [pii]'],ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1982 May 10;257(9):5274-82.,,,,,,,,,,,,

Exogenous hemin is not only incorporated into hemoglobin in these cells but also stimulates heme biosynthesis (Granick, J. L., and Sassa, S. (1978) J. Biol. Chem. 253, 5402-5406). In this study, we examined whether metalloporphyrins other than hemin can also induce differentiation, and if so, whether they can also be incorporated into hemoglobin. Among eight metalloporphyrins examined in culture of these cells, i.e. Co, Mn, Cu, Mg, Ni, Zn, Sn, and Cd protoporphyrin IX, only Co protoporphyrin (10(-4) M) was found to significantly increase the biosynthesis of heme and hemoglobin. In contrast to hemin-mediated induction of erythroid differentiation, Co protoporphyrin was not incorporated into hemoglobin in Friend cells. These data indicate that Co protoporphyrin induces the formation of heme and hemoglobin in Friend cells and that these increases are due to the enhancement of heme biosynthetic activity.","['Chang, C S', 'Sassa, S']","['Chang CS', 'Sassa S']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Hemoglobins)', '0 (Porphyrins)', '0 (Protoporphyrins)', '42VZT0U6YR (Heme)', '63AAN3JDZE (cobaltiprotoporphyrin)', 'EC 1.14.14.18 (Heme Oxygenase (Decyclizing))']",IM,"['Animals', '*Cell Transformation, Viral', 'Friend murine leukemia virus/*genetics', 'Heme/*biosynthesis/metabolism', 'Heme Oxygenase (Decyclizing)/metabolism', 'Hemoglobins/*biosynthesis', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Porphyrins/*pharmacology', 'Protoporphyrins/*pharmacology']",1982/04/10 00:00,1982/04/10 00:01,['1982/04/10 00:00'],"['1982/04/10 00:00 [pubmed]', '1982/04/10 00:01 [medline]', '1982/04/10 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0021-9258(18)34829-4 [pii]'],ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1982 Apr 10;257(7):3650-4.,['ES-01055/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,

Mild nausea and vomiting, transient elevation of serum glutamic oxaloacetic-acid-transaminase, and bilirubin were noted. All of these patients had had prior anthracycline therapy. Abnormal echocardiograms were seen in 14 of 23 patients who had echocardiograms done before and after AMSA.

Therapeutic and toxic effects in the central nervous system have been noted with systemic treatment. In order to better define the relationship between L-asparaginase administration and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) asparagine levels, L-asparaginase and asparagine were measured in the CSF of rhesus monkeys following intrathecal and i.v. administration. Following intrathecal injection, the enzyme activity of Escherichia coli L-asparaginase in the CSF demonstrated a more rapid terminal half-life than did that of 111In-labeled diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid, a marker of CSF bulk flow [4 +/- 0.7 (S.D.) hr versus 5.8 +/- 0.2 hr]. Intrathecal injection of E. coli asparaginase resulted in complete depletion of CSF asparagine for at least 5 days. A similar period of CSF asparagine depletion was observed following i.v. administration of L-asparaginase. Similar results were found in seven patients undergoing systemic L-asparaginase therapy. The minimal plasma level of L-asparaginase necessary to deplete CSF asparagine in both species was 0.1 IU/ml. Two other enzymes, Erwinia L-asparaginase and succinylated Acinetobacter glutaminase-asparaginase, were cleared from the CSF at the same rate as bulk flow. These data indicate that systemic L-asparaginase therapy may be a feasible means of treating central nervous system involvement in patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia and that there is no therapeutic advantage to using intrathecal L-asparaginase.","['Riccardi, R', 'Holcenberg, J S', 'Glaubiger, D L', 'Wood, J H', 'Poplack, D G']","['Riccardi R', 'Holcenberg JS', 'Glaubiger DL', 'Wood JH', 'Poplack DG']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['7006-34-0 (Asparagine)', '7A314HQM0I (Pentetic Acid)', 'EC 3.5.1.1 (Asparaginase)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Asparaginase/administration & dosage/cerebrospinal fluid/*metabolism', 'Asparagine/blood/*cerebrospinal fluid', 'Half-Life', 'Humans', 'Injections, Intramuscular', 'Injections, Intravenous', 'Injections, Spinal', 'Kinetics', 'Macaca mulatta', 'Male', 'Pentetic Acid/administration & dosage/cerebrospinal fluid', 'Time Factors']",1981/11/01 00:00,1981/11/01 00:01,['1981/11/01 00:00'],"['1981/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1981/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1981/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1981 Nov;41(11 Pt 1):4554-8.,['CA 20061/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,

Both compounds produced SSB's and DPC's at nearly 1:1 ratios. The SSB's and DPC's were shown to be localized with respect to each other; this was inferred from the finding that filter assays based on protein adsorption completely prevented the elution of the DNA single-strand segments between SSB's. In the case of m-AMSA, which produces relatively high frequencies of DNA lesions, the possibility that a protein bridges across the SSB was excluded by alkaline sedimentation studies. Both compounds also produced DSB's, but the SSB/DSB ratios differed; the SSB/DSB ratios increase in the following order: ellipticine greater than adriamycin greater than m-AMSA greater than X-ray [results of this paper combined with those of Ross, W. E., & Bradley, M. O. (1981) Biochim. Biophys. Acta (in press)]. The o-AMSA isomer is much less cytotoxic than m-AMSA and did not produce protein-associated strand breaks. The simplest model to explain the results is that a protein becomes covalently bound to either the 3' or the 5' termini of the intercalator-induced strand breaks. At moderately cytotoxic doses, m-AMSA yielded much larger frequencies of protein-associated SSB's than did adriamycin. m-AMSA-induced protein-associated SSB's saturated at approximately 60000 per cell over a concentration range in which m-AMSA uptake by the cells was proportional to the drug concentration. m-AMSA was found to enter and exit from cells very rapidly at 37 degrees C; protein-associated SSB's and DSB's also appeared and disappeared rapidly. At reduced temperature, however, the appearance and disappearance of protein-associated SSB's could be blocked while m-AMSA entry and exit still occurred. The saturation behavior and temperature dependence suggest that the formation and disappearance of protein-associated strand breaks is enzymatic. The simplest hypothesis is that the linked protein is a nuclease, such as a topoisomerase, which becomes bound to one terminus of the strand break it produces. It is proposed that topoisomerases producing SSB's and DSB's are stimulated to different degrees by different intercalators.","['Zwelling, L A', 'Michaels, S', 'Erickson, L C', 'Ungerleider, R S', 'Nichols, M', 'Kohn, K W']","['Zwelling LA', 'Michaels S', 'Erickson LC', 'Ungerleider RS', 'Nichols M', 'Kohn KW']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Biochemistry,Biochemistry,0370623,"['0 (Aminoacridines)', '0 (DNA, Single-Stranded)', '0 (Deoxyribonucleoproteins)', '0 (Intercalating Agents)', '0 (Nucleoproteins)', '00DPD30SOY (Amsacrine)', ""51264-17-6 (4'-(9-acridinylamino)methanesulfon-o-anisidide)"", '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)']",IM,"['Aminoacridines/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Amsacrine', 'Animals', 'Biological Transport', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'DNA, Single-Stranded/*metabolism', 'Deoxyribonucleoproteins/*metabolism', 'Doxorubicin/*pharmacology', 'Intercalating Agents/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia L1210/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Nucleoproteins/*metabolism']",1981/11/10 00:00,1981/11/10 00:01,['1981/11/10 00:00'],"['1981/11/10 00:00 [pubmed]', '1981/11/10 00:01 [medline]', '1981/11/10 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1021/bi00526a006 [doi]'],ppublish,Biochemistry. 1981 Nov 10;20(23):6553-63. doi: 10.1021/bi00526a006.,,,,,,,,,,,,

To ascertain the influence of various clinical and morphologic parameters of survival, univariate and multivariate statistical analyses were performed. Patients older than 30 years of age had significantly lower incidences of mediastinal involvement (P = 0.01), number of mitotic figures (P = 0.04), and development of leukemia (P = 0.02) than patients younger than 30.

Parathyroid glands from these dogs had a normal or atrophic microscopic appearance. Ultrastructurally, the chief cells of the parathyroid glands had small cytoplasmic areas devoid of secretory granules and containing few organelles associated with hormonal synthesis, which is indicative of an inactive phase of the secretory cycle. In relationship to total serum calcium, serum canine immunoreactive parathyroid hormone was moderately increased in 3 dogs whose parathyroid glands had morphologic characteristics of inactivity. As a result of prolonged hypercalcemia, the thyroid glands contained prominent areas of parafollicular cell hyperplasia. The ultrastructure of a typical hyperplastic parafollicular cells was characterized by a large cytoplasmic area filled with numerous secretory granules and moderate numbers of organelles associated with hormonal synthesis. The results of this study indicate that some nonendocrine malignant neoplasms of dogs may be capable of secreting a hypercalcemia substance immunologically indistinguishable from parathyroid hormone. In the absence of neoplastic involvement of bone, the canine disease has many similarities to pseudohyperparathyroidism.","['Yarrington, J T', 'Hoffman, W E', 'Macy, D', 'Hawker, C']","['Yarrington JT', 'Hoffman WE', 'Macy D', 'Hawker C']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Am J Vet Res,American journal of veterinary research,0375011,['0 (Parathyroid Hormone)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Carcinoma/pathology/veterinary', 'Dog Diseases/*pathology', 'Dogs', 'Hypercalcemia/pathology/veterinary', 'Hyperparathyroidism/pathology/*veterinary', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/pathology/veterinary', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/pathology/veterinary', 'Parathyroid Glands/*pathology', 'Parathyroid Hormone/*blood', 'Thyroid Gland/*pathology']",1981/02/01 00:00,1981/02/01 00:01,['1981/02/01 00:00'],"['1981/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1981/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1981/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Am J Vet Res. 1981 Feb;42(2):271-4.,['RR05460/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,

During 3 d of incubation with CM, when the Ml cells differentiated to macrophages and lost their mitotic activity, the actin content, F-actin ratio in total actin, and the actin synthesis showed an increase. A greater difference before and after differentiation was found in the ability of G-actin to polymerize. Actin harvested from CM-treated cells showed a greater ability to polymerize, depending on the increased concentration of MgCl2 and/or KCl and proteins, as compared with the actin from untreated Ml cells. Actin harvested from the Mml cell line, a macrophage line, had a particularly high polymerizability with or without CM treatment.

This difference was dependent not on the consolidation and maintenance therapy, but on the total dose of Ara-C used and leukemic blasts left in marrow at the end of chemotherapy.

The flattened phenotype of FF clones is stable during cell replication either in soft agar or in vivo. With the number of passages of FLC on HEF the fibronectin (FN) sensitivity of FF clones increases with a proportional reduction of their tumorigenicity. The FN-sensitivity was defined as the ability of a certain dose of FN to flatten 50% of cells of a given FF clone. Tumorigenicity was defined as the number of FF cells able to give palpable tumors, in 50% of inoculated mice. Exogenous FN does not modify the duplication time of FF clones but strongly influences their growth behavior. In the presence of FN, the growth rate of FF cells is controlled by the size of the growth are available. Highly FN-sensitive FF cells grown on FN-coated substrata die at confluency while FF cells not adherent to substrata escape cell death and grow in suspension.

The differential response of parent and purine analog-resistant cell lines to MTX is not due to host influences, for both L1210/6MP and L1210/6TG cell lines are cross-resistant to 6-MeMPR, an inhibitor of de novo synthesis, and cultured L1210/6MP cells are more sensitive to MTX than the parent cell line. Following treatment of tumor-bearing mice with MTX, the drug concentration in L1210/6TG cells was about 50% greater than in L1210/0 cells for 24 hr and may account, wholly or in part, for the increased sensitivity of the L1210/6TG cell line to MTX. L1210/6MP cells, however, accumulated less MTX than L1210/0 cells, indicating that an equivalent mechanism is not operative in these cells. DHFR activity in L1210/6TG cells was the same as that in L1210/0 cells, but activity in L1210/6MP cells was lower by 60%. Cultured L1210/6MP cells also exhibited a deficiency in DHFR activity as compared to the parent cell line. The sensitivity of the enzyme to MTX was the same for all three cell lines propagated in vivo. Therefore, the increased sensitivity of the L1210/6MP cell line to MTX may be due, in part, to decreased DHFR activity. Significantly lower levels of GTP + GDP and CTP in 6TG-resistant cells than in parent cells 4 hr after the administration of MTX to tumor-bearing mice may be related to the increased MTX sensitivity of these cells. Our results indicate that the observed alterations in drug sensitivity are associated with more than one biochemical change and that these changes are different in the two purine analog-resistant cell lines.","['Strobel-Stevens, J D', 'El Dareer, S M', 'Trader, M W', 'Hill, D L']","['Strobel-Stevens JD', 'El Dareer SM', 'Trader MW', 'Hill DL']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Biochem Pharmacol,Biochemical pharmacology,0101032,"['0 (Ribonucleotides)', 'E7WED276I5 (Mercaptopurine)', 'EC 1.5.1.3 (Tetrahydrofolate Dehydrogenase)', 'FTK8U1GZNX (Thioguanine)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Chemical Phenomena', 'Chemistry', 'Drug Resistance', 'Female', 'Leukemia L1210/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Male', 'Mercaptopurine/*pharmacology', 'Methotrexate/*pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred DBA', 'Ribonucleotides/metabolism', 'Tetrahydrofolate Dehydrogenase/metabolism', 'Thioguanine/*pharmacology']",1982/10/01 00:00,1982/10/01 00:01,['1982/10/01 00:00'],"['1982/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1982/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1982/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0006-2952(82)90096-X [pii]', '10.1016/0006-2952(82)90096-x [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Pharmacol. 1982 Oct 1;31(19):3133-7. doi: 10.1016/0006-2952(82)90096-x.,['N01-CM-87162/CM/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,

A single oral dose of acetaminophen, 125 mg/kg, was given at the fifth day of the mice survival period (7.7 days) and the animals killed twenty-four hours later. As revealed by serum glutamic-pyruvic transaminase, serum glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase and lactic dehydrogenase, acetaminophen was less hepatotoxic in leukaemic mice than in control mice by comparison with their own saline group; on the other hand the difference between control and leukaemic mice treated with acetaminophen was significant only for glutamic-pyruvic transaminase. Moreover, we found higher unchanged acetaminophen concentrations in plasma, liver, kidneys, brain and fat of the leukaemic mice as compared to controls, less conjugated metabolites in plasma and liver, decreased in vitro aniline hydroxylation and ethylmorphine N-demethylation. Finally, following acetaminophen administration, reduced hepatic glutathione was depleted to a much lesser extent in the tumor bearing animals than in controls. In conclusion, the L-1210 leukaemia seems to modify the acetaminophen hepatotoxicity and this effect might be explained by decreased acetaminophen biotransformation into toxic metabolites or intermediates.","['Lavigne, J G', ""d'Auteuil, C"", 'Lavoie, J M']","['Lavigne JG', ""d'Auteuil C"", 'Lavoie JM']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Canada,Rev Can Biol Exp,Revue canadienne de biologie experimentale,8213593,"['362O9ITL9D (Acetaminophen)', 'EC 2.6.1.1 (Aspartate Aminotransferases)', 'EC 2.6.1.2 (Alanine Transaminase)']",IM,"['Acetaminophen/blood/*toxicity', 'Alanine Transaminase/blood', 'Animals', 'Aspartate Aminotransferases/blood', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia L1210/*complications/physiopathology', 'Liver/*pathology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred Strains']",1982/07/01 00:00,1982/07/01 00:01,['1982/07/01 00:00'],"['1982/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1982/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1982/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Rev Can Biol Exp. 1982 Jul;41(2):121-8.,,,,,,,,,,,,

The irradiated recipients of the cultured marrow did not develop leukemia during the 180 days of observation post-irradiation, indicating the absence of leukemia cells in the inocula. A loss of leukemia cells in vitro occurred in cultures with and without the addition of hydrocortisone to the medium. Hydrocortisone was shown to have a stimulating effect on maintenance of hemopoietic stem cells, granulocyte progenitors and granulopoiesis in these cultures.","['Hays, E F', 'Hale, L']","['Hays EF', 'Hale L']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Eur J Cancer Clin Oncol,European journal of cancer & clinical oncology,8112045,['WI4X0X7BPJ (Hydrocortisone)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Cell Count', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*pathology', 'Hydrocortisone/pharmacology', 'Lymphoma/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred AKR', 'Neoplasms, Experimental/pathology', 'Time Factors']",1982/04/01 00:00,1982/04/01 00:01,['1982/04/01 00:00'],"['1982/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1982/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1982/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1016/0277-5379(82)90014-1 [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Cancer Clin Oncol. 1982 Apr;18(4):413-8. doi: 10.1016/0277-5379(82)90014-1.,['CA NO. 12386/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,

These kinetic perturbations were monitored by changes in growth rates, cell volumes and cell-cycle distributions. At equimolar exposure doses (based on molar concentration of purine bases), 0.1 mM poly(s6I) was more effective than 6-MP in reducing growth rate and total cell number. A 20-fold increase in the 6-MP exposure dose (to 2 mM) was required to reduce total cell number similar to 0.1 mM poly(s6I). Concomitant determination of Coulter volume distributions of treated cell populations indicated 0.1 mM poly(s6I) increased the mean population volume more than either concentration of 6-MP. Cell-cycle distributions obtained by flow cytometry showed that, simultaneously with the increase in mean population volume, poly(s6I) exposure caused a decrease of cells in G1 and S and a pronounced accumulation of cells in G2. Treatment with 6-MP caused similar cell-cycle redistributions but always less than for poly(s6I). Flow sorting of these redistributed populations indicated the increase in mean population volume during treatment with 0.1 mM poly(s6I) was almost equally due to an increased percentage of G2 cells and to an increased volume of cells with the G2 DNA content. However, with 0.1 mM 6-MP, increased volume of G2 cells was predominant. Although poly(s6I) was synthesized in an attempt to develop more effective delivery forms of biologically active compounds like 6-MP and it has close structural similarities to 6-MP, its mechanism of action is unknown.","['Tomasovic, S P', 'Higashikubo, R', 'Cohen, A M', 'Broom, A D']","['Tomasovic SP', 'Higashikubo R', 'Cohen AM', 'Broom AD']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cytometry,Cytometry,8102328,"['0 (Polyribonucleotides)', '0 (Thionucleotides)', '25249-22-3 (Poly I)', '59126-38-4 (poly(thioinosinic acid))', 'E7WED276I5 (Mercaptopurine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Division/*drug effects', '*Cell Line', 'Cell Separation', 'Cell Survival', 'Clone Cells/drug effects', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Interphase/drug effects', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia L1210/*pathology', 'Mercaptopurine/*pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Mitosis/drug effects', 'Poly I/*pharmacology', 'Polyribonucleotides/*pharmacology', 'Thionucleotides/*pharmacology']",1982/07/01 00:00,1982/07/01 00:01,['1982/07/01 00:00'],"['1982/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1982/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1982/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/cyto.990030111 [doi]'],ppublish,Cytometry. 1982 Jul;3(1):48-54. doi: 10.1002/cyto.990030111.,"['CA-11935/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-14165/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32-09097/PHS HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,

Thus leukemic cells of T-cell origin migrated farther than those of B-cell origin. In the cases of myelocytic leukemia, the distance of random migration was on the average 0.54 mm for the cells of five patients with acute myelocytic leukemia, 2.42 mm for the cells of three patients with acute myelomonocytic leukemia, 1.69 mm for the cells of four patients with chronic myelocytic leukemia at blastic crisis and 3.78 mm for the cells of one patient with chronic monocytic leukemia.

We find a marked inconsistency between values for influx Km and Ki in reciprocal experiments measuring competition between various folate compounds as well as inconsistent effects of transloading shown for 5-formyltetrahydrofolate influx, but not folic acid influx. These results argue strongly against a one-carrier model for transport of folate compounds. The most straightforward interpretation of our data is that two distinct transport systems mediate entry of folate compounds in L1210 plasma membrane vesicles. If a two-carrier model is correct, then our data indicate that one of the carriers has low capacity and high affinity for folate coenzymes and methotrexate. This system is apparently negligible as a transport route for folic acid. Transtimulation of initial influx by substrates of the low capacity system is obtained following transloading with coenzymes but not by transloading with folic acid. Our data indicate that the second folate transport system postulated by the two-carrier model has a low affinity for all the folate compounds studied. Nevertheless, the putative second system is significant, especially for folic acid transport, because it has a much higher capacity than the first transport system. In contrast to the first system, transloading with any of the folate compounds studied had no effect on initial influx mediated by the second folate transport system. The two systems are also differentially inhibited by pCMBS, DIDS and SITS and the influx Vmax for the high-affinity/low-capacity system was altered in a vesicle preparation derived from a methotrexate resistant L1210 cell line.","['Yang, C H', 'Dembo, M', 'Sirotnak, F M']","['Yang CH', 'Dembo M', 'Sirotnak FM']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Membr Biol,The Journal of membrane biology,0211301,"['0 (Formyltetrahydrofolates)', '0 (Tetrahydrofolates)', '935E97BOY8 (Folic Acid)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Biological Transport', 'Cell Membrane/metabolism', 'Cytoplasmic Granules/metabolism', 'Diffusion', 'Drug Resistance', 'Folic Acid/*metabolism', 'Formyltetrahydrofolates/*metabolism', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia L1210/*metabolism', 'Methotrexate/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Tetrahydrofolates/*metabolism']",1983/01/01 00:00,1983/01/01 00:01,['1983/01/01 00:00'],"['1983/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1983/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1983/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF01870795 [doi]'],ppublish,J Membr Biol. 1983;75(1):11-20. doi: 10.1007/BF01870795.,"['CA 08748/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 24153/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,

The inhibitory effect is at the killer cell level and not the target cell level, which suggests that 13.1 may react with a receptor on NK cells. This hypothesis was tested in assays to delineate precisely where in the NK cytolytic reaction sequence 13.1 interferes with lysis; 13.1 did not block initial NK-target cell interaction as measured in a target binding cell assay. With the use of a Ca++ pulse technique, 13.1 did not block any events occurring during Ca++-dependent programming. If the antibody was added after conjugate formation but before the addition of CaCl2 to initiate programming, however, full inhibition of NK lysis occurred. Therefore, 13.1 antibody defines a distinct stage in the NK reaction sequence that links target binding to the initiation of calcium-dependent programming events. NK cell binding alone is not sufficient to trigger lytic events, and the presence of a second structure or a distinct portion on a single structure is required to trigger lysis. We show that 13.1 blocks the ability of K562 to inhibit NK killing of Molt-4 in a cold target inhibition assay. Therefore, despite the fact that 13.1 does not disrupt conjugate formation, NK specificity may exist at a post-binding site rather than at the initial NK-target binding interaction.

To this end, the cells were separated according to size by sedimentation at unit gravity in a specially designed sedimentation chamber. The fractions were analyzed by radioautography and flow cytophotometry. The size-distributions obtained by 1g sedimentation coincided with cell-cycle age distribution. With increasing fraction number, samples highly enriched in G1, S, and G2/M cells, respectively were obtained: the smallest cells being in early G1 and the largest in mitosis. In the presence of dexamethasone (10(-6)-10(-5) M), growth slowed down after a few cell cycles and the cells accumulated in early G1 phase. Lytic cell kill by continued exposure to the drug was confined to the fractions containing the small, early G1-phase cells. These fractions were also enriched in noncycling cells that were not labeled by prolonged exposure to 3H-thymidine. After removal of dexamethasone, the cells in S and G2/M phase completed cell cycle traverse but were retarded again in the G1 and early S phase of the next division cycle. The data suggest a memory effect for previous drug exposure. It is concluded that the cytostatic and cytolytic effects of dexamethasone are separate, though not unrelated events. Cytolysis is confined to the noncycling cells that in untreated populations can exit from the dividing compartment during a transitional phase of about 60 minutes subsequent to mitotic division. The cytostatic effects potentiate cytolysis by accumulating the cells in the early G1 phase and thus increasing the probability of their transit to the G0 compartment, sensitive for drug-mediated cytolysis.","['Smets, L A', 'Bout, B', 'Brouwer, M', 'Tulp, A']","['Smets LA', 'Bout B', 'Brouwer M', 'Tulp A']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Cell Physiol,Journal of cellular physiology,0050222,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Separation', 'DNA, Neoplasm/analysis', 'Dexamethasone/*therapeutic use', 'Drug Evaluation, Preclinical', 'Interphase/*drug effects', 'Leukemia L1210/analysis/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Mice']",1983/09/01 00:00,1983/09/01 00:01,['1983/09/01 00:00'],"['1983/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1983/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1983/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/jcp.1041160318 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cell Physiol. 1983 Sep;116(3):397-403. doi: 10.1002/jcp.1041160318.,,,,,,,,,,,,

Polyamine oxidases (PAO), present in ruminant and particularily in fetal calf serum (FCS), degrade polyamines to polyaminoaldehydes and other products that inhibit cell proliferation. Since most in vitro assays for cloning tumor stem cells use FCS as an essential supplement of the nutrient media, we examined the effects of specifically inhibiting the PAO activity on the clonal growth of leukemic cells and the following normal lymphocytes: the W 25 rat chloroleukemia, the M1 mouse myeloblastic and the L 1210 rat lymphoblastic leukemia, a primary human acute myeloblastic leukemia (AML) and acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) as well as normal human PHA-stimulated lymphocytes. In the presence od horse serum, nontoxic doses of the PAO inhibitor 1-hydroxybenzyloxyamine did not affect colony growth of either cell type. However, in the presence of FCS, clonal growth of W 25, ALL, AML, and PHA lymphocytes was significantly stimulated by the enzyme inhibitor. Our data suggest (a) that poor cell proliferation of several tumors in vitro may result from the reaction of polyamines (from cells) and PAO (from serum), (b) that this can be easily tested by means of a specific PAO inhibitor, and (c) that the growth conditions can be optimized by adding nontoxic doses of the enzyme inhibitor or by exchanging FCS for another serum.","['Ali-Osman, F', 'Maurer, H R']","['Ali-Osman F', 'Maurer HR']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,J Cancer Res Clin Oncol,Journal of cancer research and clinical oncology,7902060,"['0 (Cresols)', '0 (Culture Media)', '555-61-3 (NSD 1024)', 'EC 1.5.- (Oxidoreductases Acting on CH-NH Group Donors)', 'EC 1.5.3.- (polyamine oxidase)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cattle', 'Cell Line', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Clone Cells', 'Cresols/pharmacology', '*Culture Media', '*Fetal Blood', 'Humans', 'Leukemia', 'Lymphocytes/drug effects', 'Mice', 'Neoplasms/*metabolism', 'Oxidoreductases Acting on CH-NH Group Donors/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Rats']",1983/01/01 00:00,1983/01/01 00:01,['1983/01/01 00:00'],"['1983/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1983/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1983/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF00399892 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cancer Res Clin Oncol. 1983;106(1):17-20. doi: 10.1007/BF00399892.,,,,,,,,,,,,

The compound exhibited general inhibitory effects on the macromolecular syntheses. Among them, protein synthesis was most severely inhibited by AF and to the same extent as by cycloheximide. AF, however, did not affect protein synthesis by cell-free system even at 2 mg/ml. Although AF inhibited the incorporation of [14C]acetate into total acid precipitable products only slightly, the synthetic pattern of simple lipids from [14C]acetate was significantly changed. Especially, the incorporation of [14C]acetate into squalene was almost completely blocked at 25 micrograms/ml. The incorporation of [14C]acetate into triglyceride was inhibited and that into cholesterol was enhanced. Concerning the diglycerides, the incorporation of [14C]acetate was enhanced and that of [3H]glycerol was inhibited. The incorporation of [3H]glycerol and [3H]mevalonate into the intact cell was significantly inhibited as compared with [14C]acetate.

It was found that the overall frequencies of statistically significant (P less than 0.01) increases and decreases in organ-specific tumor incidence in treated groups relative to controls were approximately the same. The decreases were due primarily to mammary gland fibroadenomas in females (which were clearly associated with decreased weight gain in the treated groups) and leukemia/lymphoma in both sexes (which were frequently associated with increased liver tumor incidences in the treated groups). A clear explanation for this latter association was not apparent. The increased tumor incidences in the treated groups relative to controls were due primarily to liver neoplastic nodules. Treated animals of either sex had slightly (but significantly) improved overall survival relative to controls. The intra- and inter-laboratory variability in control tumor incidence frequently exceeded what one would expect to find by chance alone. This investigation helps explain the decreased tumor incidences observed in many NTP feeding studies. It also indicates that attention should be directed toward the determination of underlying mechanisms responsible for the negative correlation between the incidences of liver tumors and leukemia/lymphoma.,"['Haseman, J K']",['Haseman JK'],['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Fundam Appl Toxicol,Fundamental and applied toxicology : official journal of the Society of Toxicology,8200838,,IM,"['Animals', 'Biological Assay', 'Female', 'Leukemia, Experimental/chemically induced', 'Liver Neoplasms/chemically induced', 'Male', 'Mammary Neoplasms, Experimental/chemically induced', 'Neoplasms, Experimental/*chemically induced', 'Rats', 'Rats, Inbred F344', 'Sex Factors']",1983/01/01 00:00,1983/01/01 00:01,['1983/01/01 00:00'],"['1983/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1983/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1983/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1016/s0272-0590(83)80165-1 [doi]'],ppublish,Fundam Appl Toxicol. 1983 Jan-Feb;3(1):1-9. doi: 10.1016/s0272-0590(83)80165-1.,,,,,,,,,,,,

The difficulties encountered in rendering these heteroantisera specific for a unique cell surface component have been a major drawback to a more rapid development of immunologic cell typing. With the introduction of hybridoma technology, it became possible to obtain monoclonal antibodies and markedly improve immunologic cell typing. We have, therefore, used this new technology for the production of monoclonal antibodies against human leukocyte surface antigens. This paper describes four cell type-specific monoclonal antibodies, which turned out to be very useful reagents in leukemia diagnosis. One of these antibodies, VIM-D5, is directed against a myeloid cell surface antigen. VIL-A1 is specific for the common acute leukemia associated antigen.

With the present strategy used by the National Cancer Institute and the European Organization for Research on Treatment of Cancer, most new compounds are initially tested in the P388 leukemia model. Drugs showing activity in this prescreen are subsequently evaluated in a panel of eight screens (B16, CD8, Co38, L1210, LL, CX-1, LX-1, and MX-1). Positivity in any one of these screens qualifies a new drug for further preclinical studies leading to phase I-II clinical trial. Our analyses of the experimental screening data for 1949 compounds, and the comparison of results in humans and mice for 69 drugs that have been clinically evaluated against solid tumors, have indicated that the correlation of screening and clinical results is low and that a modified approach using four systems (P388, B16, L1210, and MX-1) would have been sufficient to uncover most of the drugs presently shown to be clinically active. In order to take advantage also of the information provided by other screens of the panel, a three-stage strategy can be used. In the first stage, compounds would be tested in the P388 prescreen, with a slightly higher level of response being required (T/C% greater than or equal to 125 instead of 120). In the second stage, prescreen-positive drugs would be tested in the B16, L1210, and MX-1 systems. Drugs positive in any one of these screens may then be tested in Co38, LL, and CX-1 to determine priorities for clinical study. For new chemical structures of particular promise, this third stage could be dropped. LX-1 and CD8 are not useful in this context. Such a strategy would be much more economical and faster than the automatic use of nine systems, and the resultant savings should permit the discovery of an increased number of potentially active compounds.","['Staquet, M J', 'Byar, D P', 'Green, S B', 'Rozencweig, M']","['Staquet MJ', 'Byar DP', 'Green SB', 'Rozencweig M']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Treat Rep,Cancer treatment reports,7607107,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*administration & dosage', 'Drug Evaluation, Preclinical/*methods', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*drug therapy', 'Mice', 'National Institutes of Health (U.S.)', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Neoplasms, Experimental/*drug therapy', 'Research Design', 'United States']",1983/09/01 00:00,1983/09/01 00:01,['1983/09/01 00:00'],"['1983/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1983/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1983/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Treat Rep. 1983 Sep;67(9):753-65.,,,,,,,,,,,,

Electron micrographic studies of leukemic cells treated with 41.8 degrees hyperthermia found that structural damage to the cell, i.e., changes in the Golgi apparatus, was associated with the lack of ability to form colonies. AKR leukemia cells were more sensitive than normal cells to hyperthermic killing at 41.8 degrees and at 42.5 degrees. This differential was found whether cells of each type were heated separately or when mixed together.

The differences in sensitivity of these two cell strains to physical and chemical agents are paralleled by differences in DNA repair efficiency. Although both strains can be cloned in soft agar, LY-S cells invariably show higher plating efficiencies. In vitro mean doubling times are 12 to 15 hr and approximately 10 hr for LY-R and LY-S cells, respectively. The actual loss of tumorigenicity and changes in radio- and photosensitivity associated with conversion of LY-R cells into LY-S cells occur within a short time. This indicates that these changes (and probably other phenotypic changes mentioned above) result from a single event or from several events occurring within a relatively short time elicited by in vitro culture conditions.","['Beer, J Z', 'Budzicka, E', 'Niepokojczycka, E', 'Rosiek, O', 'Szumiel, I', 'Walicka, M']","['Beer JZ', 'Budzicka E', 'Niepokojczycka E', 'Rosiek O', 'Szumiel I', 'Walicka M']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Survival/radiation effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Leukemia L5178/*pathology', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Photic Stimulation', 'Time Factors', 'Ultraviolet Rays']",1983/10/01 00:00,1983/10/01 00:01,['1983/10/01 00:00'],"['1983/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1983/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1983/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1983 Oct;43(10):4736-42.,,,,,,,,,,,,

To determine whether comparable degrees of enhancement could be achieved in sensitive and resistant tumor lines, the magnitude of chemosensitization produced by treating the resistant tumors with the MISO-nitrosourea combinations was compared to the chemopotentiation produced in similarly treated nitrosourea-sensitive tumor lines from which the resistant lines had been derived. As evidenced by increased cure probabilities, the addition of MISO [5.0 mmol/kg (1.0 mg/g)] significantly potentiated the response of the parental nitrosourea-sensitive L1210/0 tumor to a 20-mg/kg dose of CCNU. When combined with doses of CCNU lower than 20 mg/kg or with BCNU, MISO failed to significantly modify the response of the L1210/0 tumor. Significant chemosensitization also was evident when 2.5- and 1.25-mmol/kg doses of MISO were used in combination with CCNU at 20 mg/kg. The effectiveness of BCNU and CCNU against the nitrosourea-resistant L1210/BCNU tumor was not significantly improved by MISO (5.0 mmol/kg), even when the sensitizer was combined with doses of nitrosoureas approaching 10% lethal dose (60 days) concentrations. In contrast, the effectiveness of CCNU against the parental KHT and resistant KHT/CCR tumors, assessed using a tumor regrowth assay, was equally enhanced by simultaneous MISO treatment. Therefore, one cannot safely predict the extent of enhancement which might result from the addition of MISO to a chemotherapeutic regimen based solely on the responsiveness of the tumor to the chemotherapy drug(s) alone.","['Mulcahy, R T', 'Siemann, D W']","['Mulcahy RT', 'Siemann DW']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Nitroimidazoles)', '0 (Nitrosourea Compounds)', '7BRF0Z81KG (Lomustine)', '8FE7LTN8XE (Misonidazole)', 'U68WG3173Y (Carmustine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Carmustine/*therapeutic use', 'Cell Line', 'Drug Resistance', 'Drug Synergism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia L1210/drug therapy', 'Lomustine/*therapeutic use', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C3H', 'Misonidazole/*therapeutic use', 'Nitroimidazoles/*therapeutic use', 'Nitrosourea Compounds/*therapeutic use', 'Sarcoma, Experimental/drug therapy']",1983/10/01 00:00,1983/10/01 00:01,['1983/10/01 00:00'],"['1983/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1983/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1983/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1983 Oct;43(10):4709-13.,"['CA-11051/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-11198/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-20329/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,,,,,

The in vitro growth of A65T was strictly dependent on the presence of active tumor promoters. Their action was reversible, since withdrawal of 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate resulted in rapid decrease in viability of the cells. Three classes of chemically unrelated compounds sharing tumor-promoting activity in mouse skin could support the in vitro growth of A65T: plant diterpene esters; indole alkaloids; and polyacetates. Their growth effect on A65T cells quantitatively correlated well with the tumor-promoting activity in mouse skin. However, other growth stimulators of epidermal cells such as cholera toxin and epidermal growth factor failed to support the growth of A65T. It is suggested that lymphokines such as interleukin-2 and interleukin-3 were not responsible for 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate-stimulated growth of A65T because concanavalin A-stimulated spleen cell-conditioned medium containing both interleukin-2 and interleukin-3 activities as well as WEHI-3 cell culture supernatant containing potent interleukin-3 activity did not stimulate the proliferation of A65T cells. Furthermore, 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate did not induce production of any significant amount of either activity in A65T cells. This cell line is useful for the screening of tumor promoters in environments although, so far, all the compounds capable of stimulating A65T growth have been limited to those competing with phorbol esters for the cellular receptor. Also, the cell line provides a potential model for analyzing growth requirements of developing mouse thymic leukemias.","['Kaneshima, H', 'Hiai, H', 'Fujiki, H', 'Oguro, Y B', 'Iijima, S', 'Sugimura, T', 'Nishizuka, Y']","['Kaneshima H', 'Hiai H', 'Fujiki H', 'Oguro YB', 'Iijima S', 'Sugimura T', 'Nishizuka Y']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Acetates)', '0 (Alkaloids)', '0 (Diterpenes)', '0 (Indoles)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Phorbols)', '0 (Polymers)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Acetates/pharmacology', 'Alkaloids/pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Diterpenes/pharmacology', 'Indoles/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*pathology', 'Lymphokines/pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Phorbols/*pharmacology', 'Polymers', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/*pharmacology']",1983/10/01 00:00,1983/10/01 00:01,['1983/10/01 00:00'],"['1983/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1983/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1983/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1983 Oct;43(10):4676-80.,,,,,,,,,,,,

In particular, we examined the effects of dexamethasone on (a) the early events of differentiation such as cell volume alterations and 'memory response' and (b) the onset of biochemical events associated with terminal erythroid cell differentiation. By analysing kinetics of commitment of Friend cells to terminal erythroid differentiation on a clonal basis, we have observed that dexamethasone inhibited the completion of the latent period (time elapsed prior to commitment) and impaired ""memory"" (ability to inducer-treated cells to continue differentiation after a discontinuous exposure to inducer). Treatment of Friend cells with dexamethasone did not prevent the occurrence of DMSO-induced alterations in cell volume. However, dexamethasone treatment prevented a series of biochemical events associated with terminal Friend cell differentiation. These include the decrease in the rate of both cytoplasmic and nuclear RNA synthesis as well as the induction of cytidine deaminase activity and hemoglobin synthesis. These data indicate that the dexamethasone-sensitive process(es) operate during the early stages of Friend cell differentiation and that they are responsible for the inhibition of terminal erythroid maturation. These dexamethasone-sensitive processes, however, appear to be different from those regulating cell volume alterations during the early steps of DMSO-induced Friend cell differentiation.","['Tsiftsoglou, A S', 'Wong, W', 'Housman, D E']","['Tsiftsoglou AS', 'Wong W', 'Housman DE']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Netherlands,Biochim Biophys Acta,Biochimica et biophysica acta,0217513,"['7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)', 'EC 3.5.4.5 (Cytidine Deaminase)', 'YOW8V9698H (Dimethyl Sulfoxide)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Differentiation/*drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Cytidine Deaminase/genetics', 'Dexamethasone/*pharmacology', 'Dimethyl Sulfoxide/pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance', 'Enzyme Induction', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*physiopathology', 'Mice']",1983/09/13 00:00,1983/09/13 00:01,['1983/09/13 00:00'],"['1983/09/13 00:00 [pubmed]', '1983/09/13 00:01 [medline]', '1983/09/13 00:00 [entrez]']","['0304-4165(83)90308-2 [pii]', '10.1016/0304-4165(83)90308-2 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochim Biophys Acta. 1983 Sep 13;759(3):160-9. doi: 10.1016/0304-4165(83)90308-2.,"['CA-14051/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-17575/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,

Liposomal lysis was found to be associated with the process of liposomal binding (perhaps as a result of the binding itself). Lysis was followed by release of the entrapped carboxyfluorescein into the media and its subsequent uptake by the cells. This lysis was shown to be dependent upon discrete membrane-associated sites that have some of the properties of proteins. The results of these studies suggest that liposomal binding to the cells, subsequent lysis of the liposomes and cellular uptake of their contents should be seriously considered in all studies of liposome-cell interactions as an alternate mode of interaction to the four modes (fusion, endocytosis, adsorption and lipid exchange) previously emphasized in the literature.","['Kercret, H', 'Chiovetti, R Jr', 'Fountain, M W', 'Segrest, J P']","['Kercret H', 'Chiovetti R Jr', 'Fountain MW', 'Segrest JP']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Netherlands,Biochim Biophys Acta,Biochimica et biophysica acta,0217513,"['0 (Fluorescent Dyes)', '0 (Liposomes)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Fractionation', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Membrane/*physiology/ultrastructure', 'Centrifugation, Density Gradient', 'Fluorescent Dyes', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*physiopathology', 'Liposomes/*isolation & purification/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Spectrometry, Fluorescence', 'Thymus Neoplasms/*physiopathology']",1983/08/24 00:00,2001/03/28 10:01,['1983/08/24 00:00'],"['1983/08/24 00:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1983/08/24 00:00 [entrez]']","['0005-2736(83)90091-3 [pii]', '10.1016/0005-2736(83)90091-3 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochim Biophys Acta. 1983 Aug 24;733(1):65-74. doi: 10.1016/0005-2736(83)90091-3.,"['CA-22868/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'DE-02670/DE/NIDCR NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,

However macrophages were cytostatic to antibody-coated L2C cells in that uptake of 3H-thymidine or 3H-deoxycytidine was abruptly and in some cases completely inhibited upon cell contact being established. Antigenic modulation which had proceeded sufficiently to protect against lysis by complement did not protect against cytostasis.

Non-activated monocytes lysed antibody-coated K-562 cells rapidly, the observed lysis reaching a constant level of 28% after 6 h of co-culture. Lymphokine-activated monocytes mediated ADCC with a similar time course but with higher cytolysis level (42%) compared to non-activated monocytes. The cytolysis was dependent on the amount of antibody on the K-562 cells and on the number of effector cells present in the assay. Scanning electron microscopy revealed that sensitized target cells in contact with monocytes lost their microvilli. Lysis was probably extracellular, but a small number of completely engulfed intact target cells were observed. Lymphokine-activation of the monocytes led to a dissociation of the phagocytic and cytotoxic activity, indicating that phagocytosis is not directly involved in ADCC. Thin section- and freeze-fracture electron microscopy of the contact area between effector and target cells revealed no membrane specializations. The cells were always separated by a gap of 20-30 nm interrupted by characteristic invaginations in the opposing plasma membranes.","['Espevik, T', 'Hammerstrom, J']","['Espevik T', 'Hammerstrom J']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Denmark,Acta Pathol Microbiol Immunol Scand C,"Acta pathologica, microbiologica, et immunologica Scandinavica.

Although the number of potential donors increased when cross reactive or single antigen mismatches were considered, our estimate of donor availability of this type is lower than reported previously. More donors were identified for the 39 patients with relatively common genotypes than for the remaining 61 patients. Of the latter group, 25 patients did not have any potential donors with ""no mismatches"" while in most of the others the only suitable donor was a family member.

The model relates the mutant progenitor frequency (MPF), the number of cells per million surviving cells with DNA damage after exposure to the chemical, to the mutant frequency (MF), the number of TFT-resistant cells per million survivors. For a given expression time, the deterministic relationship is linear and the proportionality constant depends on the relative suspension growth factor (rg) and relative cloning efficiencies (rc) of mutants to those of wild type cells: MF = (rg X rc) X MPF. Experimental noise leads to variations in the values of rg and rc and lack of reproducibility in the system. If mutant progenitors and their progeny grow as well as wild-type cells and if all of the parental mutant progenitors express the mutant phenotype, then rg = 1/2 and rc = 1. Biological mechanisms, such as differential growth characteristics of mutant and wild-type cells or DNA repair, can make the mutant frequency an inaccurate estimate of the MPF. For the assay to be useful as a screen for the mutagenic activity of chemicals, rg X rc has to be reasonably constant from chemical to chemical.","['Lee, Y J', 'Caspary, W J']","['Lee YJ', 'Caspary WJ']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Netherlands,Mutat Res,Mutation research,0400763,,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Division', 'DNA Repair', 'Leukemia L5178/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*genetics', 'Mathematics', 'Mesothelin', 'Mice', '*Models, Biological', '*Mutagenicity Tests', 'Mutation', 'Time Factors']",1983/08/01 00:00,1983/08/01 00:01,['1983/08/01 00:00'],"['1983/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1983/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1983/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0165-1161(83)90231-5 [pii]', '10.1016/0165-1161(83)90231-5 [doi]']",ppublish,Mutat Res. 1983 Aug;113(5):417-30. doi: 10.1016/0165-1161(83)90231-5.,,,,,,,,,,,,

An indication for the occurrence of X-ray-induced untargeted mutagenesis.,413-22,"As it is not known to what extent differential growth rates of induced mutants lead to over- and under-representation of mutants in treated populations and thereby affect the determination of mutant frequencies, the mutation induction in X-irradiated L5178Y mouse lymphoma cells was determined via two methods. The first method involves the standard protocol which may suffer from the effect of differential growth rates, while the second method is based upon the fluctuation test in which the differential growth rates can be actually measured. It appeared that the standard protocol led to a mutant frequency that was similar to the mutant frequency determined in the fluctuation test. Therefore, the standard protocol appears to lead to only a minor under-estimation if any. Substantial heterogeneity in growth rates of induced mutants was observed, but the mutants with a selective advantage appear largely to compensate for the mutants that are lost because of selective disadvantage. It was calculated that the chance for isolating the same mutant twice from a treated population had been increased 2.2-fold because of the observed differential growth rates. Therefore, our data indicate that the standard protocol does not lead to serious errors in the determination of mutant frequencies and in the sampling of mutants.

Detailed studies indicated that the mode of action of the quassinoids as protein synthesis inhibitors was identical in all of the cells where inhibition was observed; i.e., the elongation step of protein synthesis was blocked by the quassinoids.

An increase in the expression of HLA-antigens detected by beta 2-Microglobulin (beta 2-M) could be demonstrated for peripheral blood mononuclear cells, non-T cells, Null cells, activated T cells, fetal thymocytes, adherent cells, and on four malignant non-T lymphoblastoid cell lines. In contrast, no significant differences were observed in the expression of antigens specific for B-lymphocytes (B1), T-lymphocytes (T3, T4, T6, T8, T11), NK-cells (901) and adherent cells (Mo1-4). Likewise, the expression of Ia-antigens remained unaltered on non-T cells, Null cells, and monocytes. The only other effect of IFN was an increase in the number as well as the amount of lymphocytes expressing the T10 antigen. It thus seems that the enhancing effect of IFN on resting cells of the immune system is highly selective.

Common sites were the femoral and tibial diaphyses and the metaphyses around the knee. Five were in the epiphyses. Other sites were the pelvis, humerus and ulna. One patient had a lymphomatous synovial effusion of the knee. In the lower limbs the lesions were often bilateral and symmetrical. Five patients had pathological fractures.

Two of these correspond to the well-established activated and nonactivated forms, while the third appears similar to the mero-receptor complex first described by Sherman et al. (Fed. Proc., 37: 167-173, 1978). Based on their differential affinities for DNA- and DEAE-cellulose in buffers of low ionic strength (the activated complex binds to DNA- and DEAE-cellulose; the nonactivated complex binds to only DEAE-cellulose; the mero-receptor-like complex binds to neither), we have developed a rapid minicolumn chromatographic procedure for separating these forms, and have applied it to examine the relative proportion of different complexes in cytosols from cells of leukemia patients. All samples from nine patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia contained these three complexes in proportions similar to those seen with normal lymphoid tissue. Cytosols from six of eight specimens from patients with acute nonlymphocytic leukemia contained a lower proportion of activated complexes and a higher proportion of mero-receptor-like complexes than cytosols from normal or chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells. Whether such differences in the properties of cytosolic complexes are due to degradation taking place after the cells are broken, and whether they can be correlated to in vivo therapeutic response, is not known, but studies are in progress to answer these questions. The minicolumn procedure described here offers a simple and reliable method for these purposes.","['Holbrook, N J', 'Bloomfield, C D', 'Munck, A']","['Holbrook NJ', 'Bloomfield CD', 'Munck A']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Indicators and Reagents)', '0 (Receptors, Glucocorticoid)', '0 (Receptors, Steroid)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', '9013-34-7 (DEAE-Cellulose)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Chromatography, Affinity/methods', 'Chromatography, DEAE-Cellulose/methods', 'Cytosol/metabolism', 'DEAE-Cellulose', 'DNA', 'Dexamethasone/*metabolism', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Indicators and Reagents', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/metabolism', 'Lymphocytes/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Receptors, Glucocorticoid/isolation & purification/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Steroid/*metabolism']",1983/09/01 00:00,1983/09/01 00:01,['1983/09/01 00:00'],"['1983/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1983/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1983/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1983 Sep;43(9):4478-82.,"['AM 03535/AM/NIADDK NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 17323/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 26273/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,,,,,

It is lethal to B16 and CHO cells and to a variety of human tumors in the clonogenic assay at 1 ng/ml and is effective against L1210 leukemia and B16 melanoma in vivo at 1 to 50 micrograms/kg. CC-1065 inhibits DNA synthesis and binds to DNA in a nonintercalative manner in the minor groove. We report here the kinetics of inhibition of DNA synthesis and of cell progression and the phase-specific toxicity of the drug. To determine phase-specific toxicity, we started synchronous CHO cultures from mitotic cells harvested after Colcemid pretreatment. These cultures showed that mitotic cells were the most sensitive, and sensitivity decreased as the cells progressed through G1 to S and G2. Experiments with B16 and CHO mitotic cells harvested without Colcemid pretreatment also showed that mitotic cells were more sensitive than G1/S-phase cells. Cell progression studies showed that CC-1065 did not affect progression from mitosis to G1 or from G1 to S. Cells progressed slowly through S at low levels (1 ng/ml) of the drug but were blocked in S at 5 ng/ml. Cell progression from G2 to M was blocked by CC-1065. DNA synthesis in B16 cells was measured at different times after 2-hr exposure to CC-1065. The percentage of inhibition of DNA synthesis was minimum at 4 hr and maximum at 19 hr after drug exposure. Since B16 cell progression studies showed a marked change in percentage of S-phase cells during this time, the DNA synthesis rate was recalculated as cpm/S-phase cell. After this correction (i.e., expressing DNA synthesis as cpm/S-phase cell), the percentage of inhibition of DNA synthesis was minimum at 0 hr and gradually increased to maximum inhibition at 19 hr without the decrease seen previously at 4 hr.","['Bhuyan, B K', 'Crampton, S L', 'Adams, E G']","['Bhuyan BK', 'Crampton SL', 'Adams EG']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Duocarmycins)', '0 (Indoles)', '0 (Leucomycins)', '69866-21-3 (CC 1065)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/*toxicity', 'Cell Cycle/*drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cricetinae', 'Cricetulus', 'DNA Replication/drug effects', 'Duocarmycins', 'Female', '*Indoles', 'Kinetics', 'Leucomycins/*toxicity', 'Mitosis/drug effects', 'Ovary']",1983/09/01 00:00,1983/09/01 00:01,['1983/09/01 00:00'],"['1983/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1983/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1983/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1983 Sep;43(9):4227-32.,,,,,,,,,,,,

Using the human colonic tumor cell line, HT-29, time-dose studies were performed with log-phase cultures in order to determine conditions which maximize the incorporation of L-canavanine into cellular proteins while leaving a large fraction of the cells viable for subsequent gamma-ray survival measurements. At an input ratio of 2.5 (L-canavanine:arginine), the analogue exerted a cytostatic effect on the cells for at least 6 days following one cell division. Little cell killing (less than 20%) by clonogenicity was caused by L-canavanine during the first 12 hr of treatment of log-phase cells, even at a L-canavanine:arginine ratio of 20. A 24-hr exposure, however, produced an exponential decrease in survival as a function of L-canavanine concentration. The interaction between L-canavanine treatment and gamma-ray damage with respect to cell survival was examined under several conditions and times based on the above findings. Optimal enhancement of X-ray-induced cytotoxicity (assayed by loss of clonogenicity) was observed with a 48-hr exposure to the analogue at a L-canavanine:arginine ratio of 10. A marked increase in radiosensitivity was observed when L-canavanine was administered either before or after irradiation of the cells. In both protocols, enhancement was seen at all radiation doses. Together with our earlier findings showing the antitumor activity of L-canavanine in L1210 murine leukemia, these results suggest the potential usefulness of this amino acid analogue in the treatment of cancer.","['Green, M H', 'Ward, J F']","['Green MH', 'Ward JF']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,['3HZV514J4B (Canavanine)'],IM,"['Adenocarcinoma/*physiopathology/radiotherapy', 'Canavanine/*toxicity', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Survival/drug effects/radiation effects', 'Colonic Neoplasms/*physiopathology/radiotherapy', 'Drug Evaluation, Preclinical', 'Gamma Rays', 'Humans', 'Kinetics']",1983/09/01 00:00,1983/09/01 00:01,['1983/09/01 00:00'],"['1983/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1983/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1983/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1983 Sep;43(9):4180-2.,"['CA23100/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA26279/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,

When a 60-min time course of uptake was monitored, the sensitive cells had a 4-fold greater uptake than did the resistant cells. When the cells were perfused with drug-free medium, identical exchangeable levels of the drug were lost from both sublines. The difference in drug uptake could be accounted for entirely on the basis of differences in a slowly exchanging drug fraction which probably represents bound intracellular drug. In glucose-free medium, uptake of daunomycin was accelerated by metabolic inhibition to a greater extent in resistant than in sensitive cells. Furthermore, there was minimal decrease in the fluorescence when both sublines were perfused with drug-free medium. The addition of glucose to this medium induced a significant decrease in fluorescence in resistant but not in sensitive cells. These data raise the possibility that decreased drug uptake in resistant cells associated with decreased slowly exchanging drug fraction may be associated with an inherent defect in drug binding which is reversed by inhibition of energy metabolism. Parallel in vitro and in vivo studies revealed the presence of uptake heterogeneity; both sensitive and resistant cells contained subpopulations (20 to 30%) that have less or more fluorescence than the predominant pattern. This observation demonstrates the possible use of the digitized video fluorescence microscopy for recognizing subsets of cells with different drug susceptibility and to monitor the emergence of anthracycline-resistant cell populations.","['Yanovich, S', 'Taub, R N']","['Yanovich S', 'Taub RN']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,['ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Biological Transport', 'Daunorubicin/*metabolism/therapeutic use', 'Drug Resistance', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia P388/drug therapy/*metabolism/pathology', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred DBA', 'Microscopy, Fluorescence/methods']",1983/09/01 00:00,1983/09/01 00:01,['1983/09/01 00:00'],"['1983/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1983/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1983/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1983 Sep;43(9):4167-71.,"['CA 31761/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 31762/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-33249/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,

A small fraction of the population, however, undergoes spontaneous differentiation. This spontaneous differentiation was examined at the individual cell level in relation to cell multiplication, commitment, and maturation. The results indicate that murine erythroleukemic cells destined to undergo spontaneous differentiation first undergo commitment, an irreversible process characterized by cells becoming (a) capable of producing hemoglobin coupled with (b) a loss of their ability to undergo more than six subsequent cell divisions. Commitment is followed by a maturation process which includes the accumulation of erythroid specific markers, e.g., hemoglobin. With respect to commitment, spontaneous differentiation resembles the differentiation produced by most inducers but differs from that evoked by hemin. Serum hemin may therefore be exempt from implication in the spontaneous process. 12-O-Tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate, which is known to inhibit murine erythroleukemic cell differentiation, was found to exert its inhibitory effect on both the commitment and maturation steps of spontaneous differentiation. The results further indicate that cells become committed mainly during the logarithmic rather than the stationary phase of the growth cycle. Once committed, however, the cells mature during both the logarithmic and stationary phases. When logarithmic growth was maintained continuously, the rate of the spontaneous differentiation increased (20- to 100-fold) due to the higher probability of cell commitment. A steady state culture was obtained in which the rates of cell multiplication, initiation of commitment, and maturation remained constant.","['Fibach, E', 'Treves, A', 'Rachmilewitz, E A']","['Fibach E', 'Treves A', 'Rachmilewitz EA']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Hemoglobins)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)', 'YOW8V9698H (Dimethyl Sulfoxide)']",IM,"['Animals', '*Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Clone Cells', 'Dimethyl Sulfoxide/pharmacology', 'Hemoglobins/analysis', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*physiopathology', 'Mice', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology']",1983/09/01 00:00,1983/09/01 00:01,['1983/09/01 00:00'],"['1983/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1983/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1983/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1983 Sep;43(9):4136-41.,,,,,,,,,,,,

To better understand the process of myeloid maturation, the change in actin content during induced maturation of HL-60 human promyelocytic leukemia cells was studied. HL-60 cells induced toward myeloid maturation by a 5-day exposure to dimethylformamide showed an 86% increase in a 43,000 mol wt protein comigrating with rabbit muscle actin on dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gels. To further demonstrate that this was an increase in actin content, the total actin content of lysed HL-60 cells was measured by the ability of actin to inhibit DNAase I. Using this assay, actin content of HL-60 cells increased 96% during induced differentiation. The amount of incorporation of 3H-leucine into actin doubled after a 5-day exposure to dimethylformamide, suggesting the increase in actin was due primarily to new synthesis. Total new protein synthesis increased 2-7-fold during differentiation. Additional analysis of polyacrylamide gels showed increased quantities and new synthesis of a high molecular weight protein comigrating with rabbit muscle myosin. This study shows that actin content increases during myeloid maturation. It also demonstrates that the HL-60 cell line is a useful model to study both functional and biochemical events during human myeloid differentiation.","['Meyer, W H', 'Howard, T H']","['Meyer WH', 'Howard TH']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Actins)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '298-83-9 (Nitroblue Tetrazolium)', '8696NH0Y2X (Dimethylformamide)', 'EC 3.1.- (Deoxyribonucleases)', 'EC 3.6.4.1 (Myosins)', 'GMW67QNF9C (Leucine)']",IM,"['Actins/*biosynthesis', '*Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Deoxyribonucleases', 'Dimethylformamide/pharmacology', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'Enzyme Inhibitors', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leucine/metabolism', 'Myosins/biosynthesis', 'Nitroblue Tetrazolium/metabolism']",1983/08/01 00:00,1983/08/01 00:01,['1983/08/01 00:00'],"['1983/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1983/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1983/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)83940-8 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1983 Aug;62(2):308-14.,,,,,,,,,,,,

Issues of interest include the contribution of an external control, the effective handling of highly skewed exposure data, and the potential for detecting effects in populations occupationally exposed to radiation. Expressions for evaluating the power of various procedures are derived and applied to data from the Hanford population in order to determine power curves for detecting leukemia effects, with both additive and multiplicative linear models being used. It is found that the introduction of an external control can increase power, although not when an overall adjustment factor must be estimated from the data or when death rates for the study population are substantially lower than those for the control population. It is also found that very little power is lost if exposures are grouped. Finally, the power calculations indicate, as expected, that in analyses of occupationally exposed populations, such as the Hanford workers, there is very little chance of detecting radiation effects at the levels of our current estimates. However, power is reasonably good for detecting effects that are 10 to 15 times larger.","['Gilbert, E S']",['Gilbert ES'],['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",United States,Biometrics,Biometrics,0370625,,IM,"['Biometry', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Radiation-Induced/diagnosis/*epidemiology/etiology', 'Male', 'Models, Biological', 'Occupational Diseases/*epidemiology']",1983/03/01 00:00,1983/03/01 00:01,['1983/03/01 00:00'],"['1983/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1983/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1983/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Biometrics. 1983 Mar;39(1):161-71.,,,,,,,,,,,,

Ac4F3-NAcMan and Ac4-NAcMan inhibited cellular replication in suspension culture at concentrations of 0.02 and 0.08 mM, respectively. The cytotoxicity of Ac4-NAcMan was relatively reversible, whereas that produced by Ac4-F3-NAcMan was not, as judged by measurement of the cloning efficiencies of cells exposed to these agents. The analogs inhibited incorporation of N-[3H]acetylmannosamine into ethanol-soluble and -insoluble materials. Separation of ethanol-soluble metabolites by HPLC demonstrated that Ac4F3-NAcMan caused accumulation of radioactivity from N-[3H]acetylmannosamine in CMP-N-acetylneuraminic acid (CMP-NeuNAc) equal to the decrease in macromolecular-bound 3H caused by this agent. In contrast, similar exposure to Ac4-NAcMan produced a large increase in the amount of radioactivity in ethanol-soluble N-acetylneuraminic acid while decreasing the amount of label from N-[3H]acetylmannosamine in cellular CMP-NeuNAc, suggesting that the analogs differ in their biochemical sites of action. Treatment of cells with either analog increased the amount of neuraminidase-hydrolyzable sialic acid-like material on the cell surface; this appeared to be due to the incorporation of the analogs into cellular glycoconjugates, since incubation of cells with 3H-labeled analogs resulted in the appearance of radioactivity in cellular ethanol-insoluble and neuraminidase-hydrolyzable material. Incubation of cells with Ac4-NAcMan labeled with 14C in the 4-O-acetyl group further demonstrated that incorporation occurred with approx. 50% retention of this substituent. Thus, both the amount and the nature of the surface sialic acid constituents of treated cells were altered, suggesting that these or similar analogs could potentially be used to modify cellular membrane function.","['Schwartz, E L', 'Hadfield, A F', 'Brown, A E', 'Sartorelli, A C']","['Schwartz EL', 'Hadfield AF', 'Brown AE', 'Sartorelli AC']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Netherlands,Biochim Biophys Acta,Biochimica et biophysica acta,0217513,"['0 (Hexosamines)', '0 (Sialic Acids)', '10028-17-8 (Tritium)', '3063-71-6 (Cytidine Monophosphate N-Acetylneuraminic Acid)', '76375-61-6 (2-acetamido-1,3,4,6-tetra-O-acetyl-2-deoxymannopyranose)', '86900-32-5 (2-trifluoroacetamido-1,3,4,6-tetra-O-acetyl-2-deoxymannopyranose)', 'EC 3.2.1.18 (Neuraminidase)', 'X80PR7P73R (N-acetylmannosamine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cytidine Monophosphate N-Acetylneuraminic Acid/metabolism', 'Hexosamines/chemical synthesis/*metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Neuraminidase/metabolism', 'Sialic Acids/*metabolism', 'Tritium']",1983/07/14 00:00,1983/07/14 00:01,['1983/07/14 00:00'],"['1983/07/14 00:00 [pubmed]', '1983/07/14 00:01 [medline]', '1983/07/14 00:00 [entrez]']","['0167-4889(83)90051-4 [pii]', '10.1016/0167-4889(83)90051-4 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochim Biophys Acta. 1983 Jul 14;762(4):489-97. doi: 10.1016/0167-4889(83)90051-4.,"['CA-02817/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-05349/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-16359/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,

L-Alanosine resulted in increased intra-cellular levels of 5-phosphoribosyl-1-pyrophosphate (PRPP), enhanced FUra metabolism to ribonucleotide derivatives, and resulted in more FUra residues incorporated into RNA. Sequential addition of L-alanosine and FUra also resulted in synergistic cytotoxicity as determined by soft agar cloning. Adenine antagonized these biochemical and biological effects of L-alanosine. L-Alanosine also augmented the rate at which FUrd was metabolized and was also associated with a greater incorporation of the FUra residues into RNA. Cytotoxicity after sequential L-alanosine and FUrd was also synergistic. The mechanism by which L-alanosine altered the metabolism of FUrd, however, was different from the way in which it enhanced FUra metabolism in that aspartic acid and not adenine was able to reverse the effects of L-alanosine on FUrd metabolism and cytotoxicity. L-Alanosine appeared to augment the RNA-directed activity of FUra and FUrd in that there was no correlation between the enhanced metabolism and cytotoxicity of these two fluoropyrimidines and either levels of fluorodeoxyuridylate (FdUMP) which inhibits thymidylate (TMP) synthetase or inhibition of the ability of cells to incorporate deoxyuridylate into acid-precipitable material.","['Heimer, R', 'Goldberg, D', 'Cadman, E']","['Heimer R', 'Goldberg D', 'Cadman E']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Biochem Pharmacol,Biochemical pharmacology,0101032,"['0 (Nucleotides)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '2CNI71214Y (alanosine)', '30KYC7MIAI (Aspartic Acid)', 'JAC85A2161 (Adenine)', 'OF5P57N2ZX (Alanine)', 'W78I7AY22C (Deoxyuridine)']",IM,"['Adenine/pharmacology', 'Alanine/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Aspartic Acid/pharmacology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Clone Cells/metabolism', 'Deoxyuridine/metabolism', 'Leukemia L1210/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Nucleotides/metabolism', 'Pyrimidines/*metabolism', 'Time Factors']",1983/01/15 00:00,1983/01/15 00:01,['1983/01/15 00:00'],"['1983/01/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1983/01/15 00:01 [medline]', '1983/01/15 00:00 [entrez]']","['0006-2952(83)90544-0 [pii]', '10.1016/0006-2952(83)90544-0 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Pharmacol. 1983 Jan 15;32(2):199-206. doi: 10.1016/0006-2952(83)90544-0.,"['CA-24187/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-27130/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,

The earliest description of such a specific association is the one of the Philadelphia chromosome and myelogenous leukemia (1960). Other congenital karyotype abnormalities are associated with specific cancers. Examples of these are Down's syndrome with leukemia and Klinefelter's syndrome with male breast cancer. Genetic diseases of increased chromosome breakage, or of defective chromosome repair, are associated with greatly increased cancer incidence. Three such diseases have been recognized: 1) Fanconi's anemia, associated with leukemias and lymphomas, 2) Bloom's syndrome, associated with acute leukemias and lymphosarcoma, and 3) ataxia telangiectasia, associated with Hodgkin's disease, leukemia, and lymphosarcomas. Ten percent of individuals with ataxia telangiectasia will develop one of these neoplasms. Individuals with certain of these syndromes display an unusually high radiosensitivity. Radiation therapy for cancers has been fatal in patients who received as low as 3000 rad. This remarkable radiosensitivity has been quantitated in cell cultures from such cases. Evidence suggests that the apparent sensitivity may reflect subnormal ability to repair radiation damage.

Throughout 14 serial passages, the spleen cell cultures remained fibroblastic and no cytopathic effect was evident. The virus incorporates [3H]uridine, contains an RNA-dependent DNA polymerase (RDDP), has a buoyant density of 1.15 g/cm3 in sucrose, and was designated MNV-1. Virion-associated reverse transcriptase showed no preference for either Mg2+ or Mn2+ in standard RDDP assays. Complementary DNA (cDNA) transcribed from polyadenylated MNV-1 RNA hybridized to genomic DNA and RNA extracted from diseased tissues but not to nucleic acids from normal tissues of a healthy Macaca nemestrina or a Macaca mulatta. MNV-1 is therefore exogenous to these species. MNV-1 had no detectable homology to the endogenous macaque virus isolates MAC-1 and MMC-1. Liquid hybridization of MNV-1 cDNA to viral RNA derived from exogenous and endogenous subhuman primate retroviruses (SiSV(SSAV), GALV-SF, BaEV-M7, and BILN) did not reveal any significant sequence homologies. In addition, MNV-1 does not share homology with bovine leukemia virus or Mason-Pfizer monkey virus as determined by Southern blot hybridization. We conclude that MNV-1 is a unique retrovirus which has not previously been described. As the ultrastructure of virions in in vitro cell cultures, as well as disease involved tissue, show some particles with type C morphology and others with type D morphology, MNV-1 may be comprised of more than one component.","['Hefti, E', 'Ip, J', 'Giddens, W E Jr', 'Panem, S']","['Hefti E', 'Ip J', 'Giddens WE Jr', 'Panem S']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Virology,Virology,0110674,"['0 (DNA, Viral)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Cells, Cultured', 'DNA, Viral', 'Macaca/*microbiology', 'Macaca nemestrina/*microbiology', 'Monkey Diseases/*microbiology', 'Nucleic Acid Hybridization', 'Retroperitoneal Fibrosis/microbiology/*veterinary', 'Retroviridae/genetics/*isolation & purification/physiology', 'Spleen/microbiology']",1983/06/01 00:00,2001/03/28 10:01,['1983/06/01 00:00'],"['1983/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1983/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1016/0042-6822(83)90146-0 [doi]'],ppublish,Virology. 1983 Jun;127(2):309-19. doi: 10.1016/0042-6822(83)90146-0.,"['CA 19164/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'RR00166/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', 'RR01203/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,

These cells exhibited membrane properties of B-lymphocytes; quantitation of surface membrane immunoglobulins by the peroxidase labeled antibody technique showed an average number of 20,000 to 40,000 immunoglobulin molecules per marked cell. Observations by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) showed that HC have a great capacity to adhere quickly to glass coverslips, to phagocytose latex particles, and to resist trypsin treatment. These cells possess numerous inter cellular connections forming a network on the glass-coverslip, and thin cytoplasmic projections enabling them to adhere. When cells adhering to a support are stimulated by latex particles, they are able to phagocytose these particles and this results in the swelling of the cell due to the unpleating of numerous folds of the membrane. After this stimulation, HC appeared smooth. Our SEM analysis provides an explanation of the disappearance of the hairy appearance classically described. After trypsin treatment, the adhering HC remain on the glass even if they have suffered membrane damage. In conclusion, SEM examination of adhering cells and phagocytosis demonstrate the variability of the membrane aspect of the HCL cells under various culture conditions.","['Goasguen, J', 'Le Prise, P Y', 'Leblay, R', 'Richier, J L']","['Goasguen J', 'Le Prise PY', 'Leblay R', 'Richier JL']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Germany,Nouv Rev Fr Hematol,Nouvelle revue francaise d'hematologie,7909092,"['0 (Latex)', 'EC 3.4.21.4 (Trypsin)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Cell Adhesion/drug effects', 'Cell Membrane/immunology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Latex', 'Leukemia, Hairy Cell/*blood/ultrastructure', 'Male', 'Microscopy, Electron, Scanning', 'Middle Aged', 'Phagocytosis', 'Trypsin/pharmacology']",1983/01/01 00:00,1983/01/01 00:01,['1983/01/01 00:00'],"['1983/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1983/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1983/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Nouv Rev Fr Hematol. 1983;25(2):97-102.,,,,,,,,,,,,

Association of impaired NK susceptibility with sialic acid and analysis of other parameters.,71-8,"Neuraminidase treatment of parental and butyrate-induced K562 tumor cells was associated with an increase in natural killer (NK) susceptibility of these target cells. The degree of enhancement with neuraminidase was significantly greater for the NK-resistant (NRR) butyrate-differentiated K562 cells so that the relative difference between the parental NK-sensitive (NKS) K562 line and its induced NKR variants, in terms of NK sensitivity, was no longer five- or six-fold but only two-fold. The predominant reason for the altered NK susceptibilities of the target cells after neuraminidase treatment was an increase in the target-cell-binding ability of these cells as assessed by a direct conjugate-forming cell assay using Percoll-enriched NK cells and cold target competition assays. The enhancement did not appear to be due simply to an increased membrane-membrane attraction caused by a reduction of net negative cell surface charges since protamine sulphate, a positively charged molecule, had no effect on NK activity. Compared with the NKS parental K562 tumor cells, the NKR butyrate-induced cells had 3.6- to 4.0-fold higher sialo-transferase activities and were associated with significantly greater amounts of cell surface sialic acid detected both in sialyl glycoproteins (2.2- to 2.9-fold higher) and particularly within ganglioside extracts (6.2- to 13.6-fold higher). In conformity with the marked neuraminidase enhancement of NK-mediated cytolysis of the butyrate-induced targets, these NKR cells were associated with significantly enhanced levels of neuraminidase-accessible sialic acid compared to the NKS parental K562 cell line. Other parameters such as sensitivity to superoxide radicals, intrinsic superoxide dismutase levels, altered membrane repair mechanisms and transferrin competition, were not significantly different between the NKS and NKR target phenotypes. Sugar inhibition studies demonstrated an enhanced inhibition against the butyrate-induced cells with a variety of neutral sugars. The degree of inhibition with phosphorylated sugars was comparable between the parental and induced K562 tumor target cells and is consistent with our previous findings showing that these hexose phosphates may be inhibiting cytolysis at a step independent of target-cell recognition.","['Werkmeister, J A', 'Pross, H F', 'Roder, J C']","['Werkmeister JA', 'Pross HF', 'Roder JC']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,"['0 (Butyrates)', '0 (Carbohydrates)', '0 (Sialic Acids)', '107-92-6 (Butyric Acid)', 'EC 1.15.1.1 (Superoxide Dismutase)', 'EC 2.4.99.- (Sialyltransferases)', 'EC 3.2.1.18 (Neuraminidase)']",IM,"['Butyrates/*pharmacology', 'Butyric Acid', 'Carbohydrates/pharmacology', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Humans', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*immunology', 'Leukemia/*immunology', 'Neuraminidase/*pharmacology', 'Sialic Acids/analysis', 'Sialyltransferases/analysis', 'Superoxide Dismutase/analysis']",1983/07/15 00:00,1983/07/15 00:01,['1983/07/15 00:00'],"['1983/07/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1983/07/15 00:01 [medline]', '1983/07/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ijc.2910320112 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Cancer. 1983 Jul 15;32(1):71-8. doi: 10.1002/ijc.2910320112.,,,,,,,,,,,,

Fresh tumor cells were relatively resistant to lysis by autologous unseparated lymphocytes in a 4 h Cr-release assay. Positive reactions were recorded in 10 of 38 blood samples and 10 of 37 effusion specimens. Purification of large granular lymphocytes (LGL) by discontinuous Percoll gradient centrifugation resulted in enhancement of cytotoxic activity against autologous tumor cells and K562 cells, with no reactivity in LGL-depleted small T-lymphocyte populations. Significant lysis of effusion tumor cells by autologous LGL was observed in 15 of 22 blood specimens and 15 of 21 effusion samples. Further depletion of high-affinity sheep erythrocyte rosetting cells from Percoll-purified LGL populations gave an increase in autologous tumor-killing activity. Depletion of LGL/K562 conjugates from LGL populations decreased lysis of autologous tumor cells and K562 cells. Effusion tumor cells that were susceptible to lysis by allogeneic normal LGL were also killed by autologous LGL, and effusion tumor cells resistant to lysis by allogeneic NK cells were not lysed by autologous LGL. In a single-cell cytotoxicity assay in agarose, 4-26% LGL bound autologous tumor cells and 0.2-5% LGL killed these target cells, while 12-45% LGL bound K562 cells and 2-20% LGL lysed them. These results indicate that cytotoxic potential for autologous effusion tumor cells is present in the peripheral blood and pleural effusions of cancer patients; it is strongly associated with a minor proportion of LGL and restricted to the cell population that can lyse NK-sensitive K562 cells.","['Uchida, A', 'Micksche, M']","['Uchida A', 'Micksche M']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Separation', '*Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*immunology', 'Leukemia/immunology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms/*immunology', 'Pleural Effusion/immunology']",1983/07/15 00:00,1983/07/15 00:01,['1983/07/15 00:00'],"['1983/07/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1983/07/15 00:01 [medline]', '1983/07/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ijc.2910320107 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Cancer. 1983 Jul 15;32(1):37-44. doi: 10.1002/ijc.2910320107.,,,,,,,,,,,,

Eleven other cultured cell lines including three B-cell lines, three T-cell lines, two non-T, non-B cell lines, two myeloid cell lines and one monocytoid cell line were not sensitive to these interferons. The results indicated that the growth inhibitory activity of interferons was not always cell lineage-specific and cell lines which were sensitive to the one interferon were always sensitive to the other interferon, although the level of sensitivity was different. Cytocidal action of interferons was analyzed by use of the most sensitive Daudi cells. The results indicated that both interferons had a time-dependent cytocidal action, but not a concentration-dependent one.

BA showed dose-dependent inhibition of HL60 promyelocytic leukemia cells and normal human granulocyte/macrophage colonies. It showed no in vitro activity against either KG-1 myeloid leukemia cells or chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells grown in colony culture. BA failed to inhibit growth of either HL60 or KG-1 cells in liquid culture, and did not induce differentiation of HL60 cells. When tested against human tumor colony-forming cells from 30 patients with solid tumors, inhibition of colony growth greater than 70% was seen in six patients (20%).

Cellular myc-specific RNA was detected in all 30 samples of hematopoietic tissue examined, including 18 leukemias of both the lymphoid and myeloid series, three lymphomas, five normal leukocytes, and four cell lines. Although the level of expression varied over a 25-fold range, no general pattern based on cell type or disease state was evident. In addition, in all cell types examined, a single-molecular-weight myc-specific RNA species was observed. Transcriptional expression of the rel and rasH genes showed a similar lack of specificity, with the rasH gene being expressed at a low uniform level in all cell types examined. myb expression was marginally detectable in most samples, although the myeloid leukemia cells possessed approximately 4-fold higher levels. The expression of src was relatively low in most samples, with markedly elevated levels in a few diverse leukemia samples. erb expression was undetectable in all but two acute myelogenous leukemia samples. Analysis of one patient who had high levels of myc, erb, and src expression before therapy revealed a dramatic reduction in erb and src expression but not myc expression while the patient was in remission. These results indicate that primary human leukemia cells, as well as normal leukocytes, do express the cell homologues to several retrovirus-associated oncogenes, that some leukemia cells express high levels of several oncogenes, and that some of these genes are differentially expressed in specific subpopulations of cells.","['Rosson, D', 'Tereba, A']","['Rosson D', 'Tereba A']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,,IM,"['Child', 'Gene Expression Regulation', '*Hematopoiesis', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*genetics', '*Oncogenes', '*Transcription, Genetic']",1983/08/01 00:00,1983/08/01 00:01,['1983/08/01 00:00'],"['1983/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1983/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1983/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1983 Aug;43(8):3912-8.,"['CA-21765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA-28221/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 CA-09346/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,

Fifty-two percent of these patients had leukemia or lymphoma and 40% had solid tumors. All patients had lung tissue obtained premortem either by transbronchial biopsy through the flexible fiberoptic bronchoscope or by open lung biopsy. There was a 27% complication rate in these invasive procedures including bleeding, pneumothorax, and ventilatory support. Infectious agents were found in only 13 cases (25%) with a mortality rate of 62%. The pathologic finding of the underlying malignant disease or organizing pneumonia portended a poor prognosis with 100% and 80% mortality, respectively. Twenty-one patients had biopsy tissue revealing only nonspecific pathologic changes and were associated with the lowest mortality (19%). It was found that 50% of the solid tumor patients with unexplained pulmonary infiltrates had nonspecific pathologic changes. The biopsy findings resulted in a change in the therapy in 29% of the cases and in 19% of the cases the subsequent change in therapy resulted in marked improvement.

Of 26 sublines that were recloned, six cell lines showing different degrees of Gg3Cer expression at the cell surface were used for analysis of the glycolipid composition as related to its cell surface antigenicity. Three remarkable correlations between glycolipid composition and the antigenicity of Gg3Cer have been found: (a) high-expressor sublines were characterized by a large proportion of a unique molecular species of Gg3Cer having alpha-hydroxypalmitic acid in its ceramide moiety in striking contrast to low expressors which did not contain this molecular species; (b) low expressors contained a large quantity of ganglio-N-tetraosylceramide (Gg4Cer) and NeuAc alpha 2 leads to 3Gal beta 1 leads to 3GalNAc beta 1 leads to 4Gal beta 1 leads to 4Glc beta 1 leads to 1 Cer (GM1b) gangliosides, whereas these glycolipids were almost absent in high-expressor clones; and (c) nonexpressors, which were converted from the high expressors in vivo through immunotherapy with the monoclonal antibodies to Gg3Cer, contained a large quantity of ganglio-N-tetraosylceramide and NeuAc alpha 2 leads to 3Gal beta 1 leads to 3GalNAc beta 1 leads to 4Gal beta 1 leads to 4Glc beta 1 leads to 1Cer. The nonexpressors should have an induced enzyme system to metabolize Gg3Cer to ganglio-N-tetraosylceramide and NeuAc alpha 2 leads to 3Gal beta 1 leads to 3GalNAc beta 1 leads to 4Gal beta 1 leads to 4Glc beta 1 leads to 1Cer. Three factors, i.e., ceramide composition, coexisting glycolipids, and an antibody-dependent glycolipid change, are therefore important in determination of glycolipid antigenicity and antigen modulation by antibodies. The ceramide composition may affect glycolipid organization in membranes, and the coexisting glycolipid having a longer carbohydrate chain may mask the accessibility of antibody to the antigenic glycolipid. The antigenic modulation by the action of the antibody in vivo may be based on activation of a new glycosyltransferase.","['Kannagi, R', 'Stroup, R', 'Cochran, N A', 'Urdal, D L', 'Young, W W Jr', 'Hakomori, S']","['Kannagi R', 'Stroup R', 'Cochran NA', 'Urdal DL', 'Young WW Jr', 'Hakomori S']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Ceramides)', '0 (Fatty Acids)', '0 (Gangliosides)', '0 (Glycolipids)', '0 (Glycosphingolipids)', '35960-33-9 (ganglio-N-triaosylceramide)', '37758-47-7 (G(M1) Ganglioside)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/*analysis', 'Ceramides/*analysis', 'Fatty Acids/analysis', 'G(M1) Ganglioside/analysis', 'Gangliosides', 'Glycolipids/*analysis', 'Glycosphingolipids/*immunology', 'Leukemia L5178/*analysis', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*analysis', 'Mice']",1983/10/01 00:00,2001/03/28 10:01,['1983/10/01 00:00'],"['1983/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1983/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1983 Oct;43(10):4997-5005.,"['CA 20026/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'GM 23100/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,

The plasma concentration of the major protease inhibitor of the coagulation mechanism, antithrombin III, is substantially decreased in patients receiving this drug. This observation has generated speculation that L-asparaginase may induce a hypercoagulable state in humans. To examine this hypothesis, we studied ten patients with ALL in remission who were being treated with the above chemotherapeutic agent. Our data revealed that infusion of this enzyme leads to a marked decrease in the plasma concentrations of prothrombin as well as antithrombin III. However, we have also observed a constant level of thrombin generation during the same period of time as monitored by plasma levels of prothrombin activation fragment (F1 + 2) and thrombin-antithrombin complex (TAT). Based upon these findings we suggest that administration of L-asparaginase does not usually lead to the induction of a hypercoagulable state.","['Bauer, K A', 'Teitel, J M', 'Rosenberg, R D']","['Bauer KA', 'Teitel JM', 'Rosenberg RD']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Thromb Res,Thrombosis research,0326377,"['0 (Peptide Fragments)', '9000-94-6 (Antithrombin III)', '9001-26-7 (Prothrombin)', 'EC 3.4.21.5 (Thrombin)', 'EC 3.5.1.1 (Asparaginase)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antithrombin III/analysis', '*Antithrombin III Deficiency', 'Asparaginase/*adverse effects', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Humans', 'Peptide Fragments/analysis', 'Prothrombin/analysis', 'Thrombin/analysis', 'Thrombosis/blood/*chemically induced']",1983/02/15 00:00,1983/02/15 00:01,['1983/02/15 00:00'],"['1983/02/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1983/02/15 00:01 [medline]', '1983/02/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1016/0049-3848(83)90247-5 [doi]'],ppublish,Thromb Res. 1983 Feb 15;29(4):437-42. doi: 10.1016/0049-3848(83)90247-5.,"['CA19589/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL25066/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL28960/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,

In 4 exposed patients (19%) all bone marrow cells had clonal chromosomal aberrations (designated AA), while also 4 of the non-exposed patients (15%) were AA. Thus in young ANLL patients, there was no significant association between occupational exposure to potential mutagenic/carcinogenic agents and the AA constitution of the leukaemic cells. (2) 51 patients were 55 years of age or older (median 65 years). 16 were exposed and 8 of these (50%) had the AA constitution. 35 patients were non-exposed and only 4 (11%) were AA. It is known from previous studies that the survival of ANLL patients with AA is extraordinarily short. Accordingly the overrepresentation of AA in exposed patients 55 years or older, was associated with a shorter survival than that of the non-exposed elderly patients. The results suggest that etiologic factors may influence the clinical course of ANLL, especially in elderly patients.","['Brandt, L', 'Mitelman, F', 'Nilsson, P G']","['Brandt L', 'Mitelman F', 'Nilsson PG']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Denmark,Scand J Haematol,Scandinavian journal of haematology,0404507,,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Aged', '*Aging', '*Chromosome Aberrations', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia/chemically induced/*genetics/mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Occupational Diseases/*genetics/mortality', 'Prognosis', 'Sex Factors']",1983/03/01 00:00,1983/03/01 00:01,['1983/03/01 00:00'],"['1983/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1983/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1983/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1600-0609.1983.tb01480.x [doi]'],ppublish,Scand J Haematol. 1983 Mar;30(3):227-31. doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0609.1983.tb01480.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,

A progressive increase in the intensity of [3H]TdR labeling of many replicons was observed after irradiation in the LS cells, but not in LR cells. This indicated a reduced or absent endogenous dTTP supply after irradiation in the LS cells, implicating a defect in nucleoside precursor production. Irradiated normal human and A-T cells did not show this effect. After 2 Gy, the frequency of initiation of replicons into synthesis was temporarily reduced in the normal human but not in the A-T cells. After 20 Gy, the rate of DNA chain growth was preferentially reduced in the normal human cells, but an increase was observed in the A-T cells. This increased rate could be explained in terms of a normal supply of complexes involved in chain elongation being distributed over a reduced number of initiated replicon clusters in the A-T cells.","['Ockey, C H']",['Ockey CH'],['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Radiat Res,Radiation research,0401245,['9007-49-2 (DNA)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Ataxia Telangiectasia/*metabolism', 'Autoradiography', 'Cell Line', 'DNA/analysis/metabolism/*radiation effects', 'Fibroblasts/metabolism/radiation effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia L5178/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Replicon/*radiation effects', 'Time Factors', 'X-Rays']",1983/05/01 00:00,1983/05/01 00:01,['1983/05/01 00:00'],"['1983/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1983/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1983/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Radiat Res. 1983 May;94(2):427-38.,,,,,,,,,,,,

Analysis with a logit model was used to estimate odds ratios that compared the probabilities of death in an acute care hospital and in a chronic care facility with the probability of death at home. Patients whose cancers had been diagnosed less than 1 month before their deaths were significantly more likely to die in a hospital than were patients whose cancers had been diagnosed earlier. Cancer sites, too, were significantly related to place of death: persons with leukemia or lymphoma were most likely to die in a hospital, followed by patients with lung, breast, and upper gastrointestinal tract cancers; persons with colorectal, genitourinary, and miscellaneous cancers were most likely to die at home. The patients whose deaths were studied were classified by socioeconomic area (SEA) ranking.

(Other markers, such as ouabain- or methothrexate-resistance and alanine independence, in other L5178Y mouse lymphoma cells were also examined, but our criteria for the acceptability of data or the paucity of data considerably reduced the value of these mutagenesis test systems to this study.) The biochemical basis for the L5178Y/TK+/- assay depends on the ability of TK-competent cells to phosphorylate 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine or trifluorothymidine. The phosphorylated product or its metabolites kill these cells, thus, medium containing 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine or trifluorothymidine is capable of selecting for cells that are lacking the TK enzyme (TK-/-). TK-/- cells eventually give rise to a bimodal distribution of colony sizes. The relative proportion of small and large colonies appears to be characteristic of the mutagen, its dose, and the length of the expression period. A total of 108 references were reviewed and 48 chemical agents were evaluated. Of these, in vivo carcinogenicity data existed for 44 and covered a wide variety of chemical classes (43 compounds) and a complex mixture. In this system, 39 agents were positive, 1 was negative, and 4 yielded inconclusive results. The 44 test substances evaluated were insufficient to single out agents or agent classes for which the assay was particularly well suited; however, with the exception of thymidine analogs, the system seems to be versatile. The correlation of the TK locus assay results with the carcinogenicity data revealed that 2 agents were definite false positives (sodium azide and methotrexate) and 1 agent was a definite false negative (1,1-dimethylhydrazine). Further evaluation suggested that 4-acetylaminofluorene and diphenylnitrosamine were questionable false positives, while benzo[e]pyrene was a questionable false negative. (The term questionable was used to imply uncertainties concerning the mutagenicity and/or carcinogenicity data). Thus, the assay is of value in the battery approach to mutagenicity/carcinogenicity screening.","['Clive, D', 'McCuen, R', 'Spector, J F', 'Piper, C', 'Mavournin, K H']","['Clive D', 'McCuen R', 'Spector JF', 'Piper C', 'Mavournin KH']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",Netherlands,Mutat Res,Mutation research,0400763,"['0 (Mutagens)', 'EC 2.7.1.21 (Thymidine Kinase)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Genes/*drug effects', 'Leukemia L5178/*physiopathology', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*physiopathology', 'Mice', 'Mutagenicity Tests/standards', 'Mutagens/*toxicity', '*Mutation', 'Thymidine Kinase/genetics', 'United States', 'United States Environmental Protection Agency']",1983/06/01 00:00,1983/06/01 00:01,['1983/06/01 00:00'],"['1983/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1983/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1983/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0165-1110(83)90005-2 [pii]', '10.1016/0165-1110(83)90005-2 [doi]']",ppublish,Mutat Res. 1983 Jun;115(2):225-51. doi: 10.1016/0165-1110(83)90005-2.,,,,,,,,,,,,

Towards the aim of influencing cell behaviour by lowering membrane fluidity, reaction conditions for catalytic hydrogenation at physiological temperature and pH have been established that effect reduction of the unsaturated species, and preferentially the polyunsaturated forms, but this has not yet been accomplished without killing the cells. That saturation of ethylenic linkages per se is the cause of death is indicated by separate findings showing that the lymphocytes are capable of withstanding hydrogen gas at the requisite high pressure (9 atm.) or exposure alone to the rhodium catalyst [chlorotris (sodium diphenylphosphinobenzene-m-sulphonate)-rhodium(I) tetrahydrate]. It remains feasible that future use of these two agents in combination under milder conditions to produce much lower degrees of hydrogenation than those reported here will permit the cells to survive. Concerning fatty acyl chain composition, the lymphocytes from most of the patients exhibited an inversion in the level of palmitic and stearic acid. A consistently abnormal pattern exhibited by the patients was a rise in oleic acid and a fall in arachidonic acid content. This same alteration has been demonstrated elsewhere in transformed/neoplastic cell types and hence it could well represent phenotypic expression in the CLL lymphocyte of malignant change.

All of the antibodies, whether type-specific to 17D YF or flavivirus cross-reactive, mediated antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) of virus growth in P388D1 cells. There was no consistent relationship between ADE titres and the degree or pattern of neutralizing and/or haemagglutination inhibition activity. Monoclonal antibodies of different isotypes were used to investigate further the properties of P388D1 Fc receptors. The effects of trypsin treatment of P388D1 on ADE were similar to those previously described in experiments measuring direct binding of IgG proteins or rosetting of sheep red blood cells (SRBC) by macrophages, demonstrating sensitivity to digestion by trypsin of the Fc receptor for monomeric IgG2a but not for IgG2b. Aggregated myeloma proteins of IgG2a and IgG2b isotypes competed equally well with either IgG2a or IgG2b monoclonal antibodies to 17D YF in inhibition of ADE. However, selective inhibition by the homologous isotype was observed when rosetting by P388D1 of SRBC coated with IgG2a or IgG2b monoclonal antibodies was examined. These results may help to explain apparent discrepancies previously reported between experiments utilizing direct binding of IgG proteins and those using rosetting of antibody-coated SRBC to examine Fc receptor properties and indicate that immune complexes of virus and antibody resemble aggregated immunoglobulins with respect to macrophage Fc receptor function and differ from antibody-coated SRBCs.","['Schlesinger, J J', 'Brandriss, M W']","['Schlesinger JJ', 'Brandriss MW']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,J Gen Virol,The Journal of general virology,0077340,"['0 (Antigen-Antibody Complex)', '0 (Receptors, Fc)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigen-Antibody Complex', 'Cell Line', 'Hemagglutination Inhibition Tests', 'Hybridomas/immunology', 'Leukemia P388/immunology', 'Macrophages/*immunology', 'Mice', 'Plasmacytoma/immunology', 'Receptors, Fc/*immunology', 'Yellow fever virus/*immunology/pathogenicity']",1983/06/01 00:00,1983/06/01 00:01,['1983/06/01 00:00'],"['1983/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1983/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1983/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1099/0022-1317-64-6-1255 [doi]'],ppublish,J Gen Virol. 1983 Jun;64 (Pt 6):1255-62. doi: 10.1099/0022-1317-64-6-1255.,,,,,,,,,,,,

In contrast, drug-induced agranulocytosis was more severe, with a higher incidence of positive blood cultures, low cellularity of initial bone marrow aspirates, and a shorter duration of neutropenia.

Peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) from immune animals were assayed for cytotoxic activity using a 51Cr release microcytotoxicity assay. The time courses for appearance of cytotoxic cells were similar for all cats: effector lymphocytes appeared in the blood 7 days after immunization; peak activity occurred about day 16, and cytotoxic PBL were no longer detectable by 35 days. The specificity of cytotoxic lymphocytes was studied using autochthonous and allogeneic targets. PBL from each of five immunized cats killed autochthonous transformed fibroblast (ATF) targets, but the immune lymphocytes were not cytotoxic for non-transformed autochthonous fibroblasts, for allogeneic fibroblasts transformed with FeSV, or for an allogeneic lymphoma cell line which produces feline leukemia virus (FeLV). Specific restriction of target-cell killing to the ATF occurred at all effector:target-cell ratios tested, and was maintained throughout prolonged assay incubation periods. The results suggest that for cytotoxicity to occur it is necessary for the immune lymphocytes to recognize a combination of virus-associated antigens and ""self"" antigens on the ATF.

This association may have no relevance to the efficacy of treatment. The assignment of patients to response categories also represents a methodologic problem. Variability in the definition of a nonresponder and the handling of early deaths can both lead to varying conclusions concerning survival.

Plasma ara-C levels, which could be detected in only 2 of 11 patients examined, were maintained (over 0.08 micrograms/ml) for 8 hr after infusion. Urinary BHAC excretion was less than 0.2 micrograms/ml of the sensitivity limit in all samples. Prolonged urinary ara-C excretion was detected, but it was only 0.5% of the administered BHAC for 24 hr. At 12 hr after a 200-mg infusion of BHAC, BHAC level in bone marrow fluid was significantly higher (p less than 0.01) than that in plasma. In spite of the lipophilic nature of the agent, the BHAC concentration in cerebrospinal fluid was less than 0.2 micrograms/ml in 8 of 9 patients without meningeal involvement. These findings were thought to indicate a restricted and prolonged BHAC distribution including plasma, blood cells, and bone marrow fluids, which may be of importance in the administration of BHAC in the chemotherapy of hematological cancers.","['Ueda, T', 'Nakamura, T', 'Ando, S', 'Kagawa, D', 'Sasada, M', 'Uchino, H', 'Johno, I', 'Akiyama, Y']","['Ueda T', 'Nakamura T', 'Ando S', 'Kagawa D', 'Sasada M', 'Uchino H', 'Johno I', 'Akiyama Y']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '3083-77-0 (Arabinofuranosyluracil)', '9YVR68W306 (enocitabine)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*metabolism', 'Arabinofuranosyluracil/metabolism', 'Bone Marrow/metabolism', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Cytarabine/*analogs & derivatives/metabolism', 'Erythrocytes/metabolism', 'Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infusions, Parenteral', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia/blood/cerebrospinal fluid/*metabolism', 'Middle Aged', 'Time Factors']",1983/07/01 00:00,1983/07/01 00:01,['1983/07/01 00:00'],"['1983/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1983/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1983/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1983 Jul;43(7):3412-6.,,,,,,,,,,,,

High-dose FUra plus delayed infusion with uridine was more effective than FUra (200 mg/kg) in inhibiting the growth of the B16 melanoma. High-dose FUra plus uridine rescue was, however, no more effective than FUra (200 mg/kg) in increasing the survival times of mice bearing the L1210 leukemia. To see if uridine rescue from FUra toxicity correlated with effects against a sensitive normal tissue, bone marrow nucleated cellularity of normal, non-tumor-bearing mice was monitored after drug treatment. In mice treated with FUra (200 mg/kg) followed in 24 hr by a 5-day infusion with either uridine (5 g/kg/day) or 0.9% NaCl solution, there was not as great a decrease in cellularity at the nadir with uridine, and, in addition, uridine accelerated recovery as compared to 0.9% NaCl solution. Furthermore, uridine (5 g/kg/day), but not thymidine (dThd) (5 g/kg/day) or 2'-deoxyuridine (dUrd) (5 g/kg/day), had a sparing effect on the depression in bone marrow nucleated cellularity seen at the nadir on Day 4 after Fura (200 mg/kg). The specificity of uridine to rescue mice from the lethal toxicity of the related fluorinated pyrimidines, 5-fluorouridine and 5-fluoro-2'-deoxyuridine, was also examined.

The results confirmed previous investigators' findings of the increase in cathepsin D activity (specific activity) in liver and muscle of tumor bearers. In addition, it was found that this increase was a general response of the host since heart, kidney, lung, and spleen cathepsin D specific activity were also enhanced in tumor bearers. These increases ranged from an average of 10% for spleen to 100% for gastrocnemius muscle. This effect was age related in heart and kidney. As a working hypothesis, we propose the concept that tumor bearers release protease-enhancing factor(s) which trigger increase or enhancement of cathepsin D activity in host tissues by yet unknown mechanisms. Pepstatin (60 mg/kg), a known inhibitor of cathepsin D in vitro, was shown to provide long-lasting inhibition (3 to 6 days) of cathepsin D in vivo in non-tumor bearers particularly in spleen, liver, kidney, lung, and heart. Evidence is provided from assays of cell fractions that this inhibition takes place at or in the lysosome. The duration of the effectiveness of pepstatin was altered in tumor bearers in that cathepsin D activity of heart, lung, and spleen had returned to near normal values in 48 hr following pepstatin injection. However, in muscle, liver, and kidney, significant inhibition (90%) still persisted in tumor bearers as it did in non-tumor bearers.

A series of model compounds has been studied to determine if the quinone group is involved in the cytotoxic activity of these agents and to investigate the mechanism of this action. Hydrolyzed benzoquinone mustard, which contains a quinone group, produced significant cell kill of L5178Y lymphoblasts, whereas hydrolyzed aniline mustard, which has a similar chemical structure but contains no active functional groups, showed little activity against this cell line. Benzoquinone mustard, which possesses both a quinone moiety and an active alkylating group, was approximately 30,000 times more active against L5178Y cells than was hydrolyzed benzoquinone mustard. It was approximately 600 times more active than aniline mustard, a compound which has the same alkylating group but no quinone function, and 200 times more active than an equimolar combination of aniline mustard and hydrolyzed benzoquinone mustard. The cytotoxic activity of hydrolyzed benzoquinone mustard was inhibited by either superoxide dismutase or catalase, while catalase but not superoxide dismutase inhibited the activity of benzoquinone mustard. Neither enzyme had any effect on the cytocidal action of aniline mustard. These studies suggest that the presence of a quinone group in the chemical structure of a compound can result in significant cell kill by a mechanism that appears to involve free radicals and active oxygen species. In addition, if the compound contains an alkylating group which can bind to DNA, as well as a quinone moiety, the cytocidal activity of the agent appears to be enhanced and is greater than that resulting from an additive effect of the two groups.","['Begleiter, A']",['Begleiter A'],['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Quinones)', 'EC 1.11.1.6 (Catalase)', 'EC 1.15.1.1 (Superoxide Dismutase)']",IM,"['Animals', '*Antineoplastic Agents', 'Catalase/pharmacology', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia L5178/*drug therapy', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*drug therapy', 'Mice', 'Quinones/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Superoxide Dismutase/pharmacology']",1983/02/01 00:00,1983/02/01 00:01,['1983/02/01 00:00'],"['1983/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1983/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1983/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1983 Feb;43(2):481-4.,,,,,,,,,,,,

Exposure of the erythroblasts to two reversible inhibitors of protein synthesis, puromycin and cycloheximide, enhanced their association with and phagocytosis by macrophages. The effect was evident after the drugs had caused a partial inhibition of protein synthesis and appeared to be reversible. By contrast, the treatment of erythroblasts with the inhibitor of RNA-synthesis, actinomycin D, which caused a marked depression of RNA but not of protein synthesis, failed to affect the interaction of erythroblats with macrophages.

None of the patients had received antibiotics, nor had a history of previous episodes of colitis. Three had cultures positive for colonic organisms during the episodes.

Gross evidence of disease was found in the cecum, the transverse colon, and rectosigmoid in three patients, but the true extent of disease was underestimated. Microscopic examination of the two resected specimens showed extensive mucosal and variable submucosal necrosis with invasion of the colonic wall by bacteria. Acute inflammatory changes were absent. With profound neutropenia, the colon wall lacks resistance to invasion by the resident microflora. The condition is probably best treated without operation.

A variety of approaches were used in discriminating between transport and kinase-mediated phosphorylation. Under these conditions, two systems mediating influx were delineated which exhibited high-affinity [Km = 13.9 +/- 2 (S.E.) microM] or low-affinity [Km = 199 +/- 27 microM] for [3H]-adenosine. Both systems exhibited high capacities, but that associated with the low-affinity system (V 37 degrees max = 263 +/- 43 nmol = 99.6 +/- 12 nmol sec/g, dry weight). The relative difference in affinity of these two systems during influx was also reflected in the values for influx Ki obtained with other nucleosides and nucleoside analogues. Influx of [3H]-adenosine by each mediated system was inhibited by 6-(2-hydroxy-5-nitrobenzyl)thioguanosine, a specific transport inhibitor, and by 9-beta-D-arabinofuranosylpurine-6(1H)thione which is not phosphorylated in L1210 cells. Influx kinetics were the same in L1210 cells, in adenosine triphosphate-depleted L1210 cells (L1210/ara-C/MMPR) which have substantially reduced ability for [3H]adenosine phosphorylation, and in the presence of 2'-deoxycoformycin, a potent inhibitor of adenosine deaminase. The same multiplicity in mediated influx of [3H]adenosine was shown at 0 degrees when transport became rate limiting to total uptake. The high-affinity system mediating [3H]adenosine influx was also elucidated in L1210 cell plasma membrane vesicles in the presence or absence of 2'-deoxycoformycin. Almost all of the natural nucleosides examined competed less effectively with [3H]adenosine for influx by the high-affinity system than by the low-affinity system. These results are discussed with respect to possible pharmacological implications.","['Chello, P L', 'Sirotnak, F M', 'Dorick, D M', 'Yang, C H', 'Montgomery, J A']","['Chello PL', 'Sirotnak FM', 'Dorick DM', 'Yang CH', 'Montgomery JA']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Purine Nucleosides)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'K72T3FS567 (Adenosine)', 'P2K93U8740 (fludarabine)']",IM,"['Adenosine/*metabolism', 'Animals', 'Biological Transport', 'Cell Membrane/metabolism', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia L1210/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Purine Nucleosides/*metabolism', 'Temperature', 'Time Factors', 'Vidarabine/analogs & derivatives/metabolism']",1983/01/01 00:00,1983/01/01 00:01,['1983/01/01 00:00'],"['1983/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1983/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1983/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1983 Jan;43(1):97-103.,"['CA 08748/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 24153/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 26318/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,

VP-16 has been shown to cause single-strand breaks (SSBs) in DNA, but their relationship to cytotoxicity has not been determined. We have investigated the action of VP-16 using mouse leukemia L1210 cells in culture. By using the alkaline elution technique, we reaffirmed the occurrence of SSBs in DNA over the drug concentration range 1 to 60 microM. We were able to demonstrate additional types of DNA damage in the form of DNA double-strand breaks and DNA-protein cross-links within the same dose range. The number of double-strand breaks formed per SSB was consistent over this dose range and greater than that found after exposure of L1210 cells to gamma-irradiation. DNA SSBs and double-strand breaks were also shown to occur in isolated nuclei, indicating that cytoplasmic components are not required for this drug action. Colony formation by L1210 cells in soft agar decreased over a drug concentration range similar to that which produced DNA damage. The correlation between the effective dose range in the colony-forming assay and the DNA scission experiments supports the hypothesis that DNA breakage is responsible for drug cytotoxicity. The demonstration of strand scission in isolated nuclei may provide an experimental model for elucidating the exact mechanism of action of VP-16.","['Wozniak, A J', 'Ross, W E']","['Wozniak AJ', 'Ross WE']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (DNA, Single-Stranded)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'L36H50F353 (Podophyllotoxin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Chemical Phenomena', 'Chemistry', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'DNA/*analysis', 'DNA, Single-Stranded/analysis', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Etoposide/*therapeutic use', 'Leukemia L1210/*drug therapy/genetics', 'Mice', 'Podophyllotoxin/*analogs & derivatives']",1983/01/01 00:00,1983/01/01 00:01,['1983/01/01 00:00'],"['1983/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1983/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1983/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1983 Jan;43(1):120-4.,['RCDA CA-00537/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,

Theoretical calculations predicted that entry of chlorambucil into cells by simple diffusion would be rapid and essentially complete in 45 sec or less. Uptake of intact chlorambucil was rapid, reaching a cell/medium ratio of approximately 1.5 in less than 15 sec at both 37 degrees and 4 degrees, consistent with a simple diffusion mechanism. In cells treated with [14C]chlorambucil for 60 min, the intracellular level of intact drug decreased with time, and this decay was attributed to hydrolysis and alkylation. The level of intact drug in the medium decreased at a similar rate resulting in a nearly constant cell/medium distribution ratio. Intact chlorambucil in the cells was found to be entirely ethanol- and trichloroacetic acid-soluble. Efflux of intact chlorambucil was very rapid and temperature-insensitive. These findings suggest that chlorambucil efflux, as well as influx, is by a simple diffusion mechanism. A derivative of chlorambucil was found in ethanol solutions of the drug. This derivative, which may be the ethyl ester of the drug, is highly concentrated in cells and may interfere with pharmacological investigations of chlorambucil.","['Begleiter, A', 'Goldenberg, G J']","['Begleiter A', 'Goldenberg GJ']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Biochem Pharmacol,Biochemical pharmacology,0101032,"['18D0SL7309 (Chlorambucil)', '3K9958V90M (Ethanol)', '5V2JDO056X (Trichloroacetic Acid)']",IM,"['Alkylation', 'Animals', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chlorambucil/*metabolism', 'Chromatography, Thin Layer', 'Ethanol/pharmacology', 'Hydrolysis', 'Leukemia L5178/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*metabolism', 'Lymphocytes/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Time Factors', 'Trichloroacetic Acid/pharmacology']",1983/02/01 00:00,1983/02/01 00:01,['1983/02/01 00:00'],"['1983/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1983/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1983/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0006-2952(83)90535-X [pii]', '10.1016/0006-2952(83)90535-x [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Pharmacol. 1983 Feb 1;32(3):535-9. doi: 10.1016/0006-2952(83)90535-x.,,,,,,,,,,,,

After a lag of 1-2 hours, a second phase occurred which exhibited very little or no additional ligation but further compaction of the nucleoid DNA. Both the DNA strand rejoining and initial nucleoid compaction of the first phase were inhibited by 3-ABA2 but not by novobiocin, and the second phase was inhibited by novobiocin but not by 3-ABA. The two phases of reconstitution of nucleoid compactness following X-irradiation are thus distinguishable by their time of occurrence and by their sensitivity to inhibitors of DNA-related enzymes.

Comparison of the time course of altered urinary excretion of these RNA catabolites with the appearance of a recognizable tumor after MCA application revealed that the onset of the altered excretion rate of these compounds precedes tumor diagnosis. At present, the time-course studies in our mice exposed to a single X-ray dose to induce lymphoblastic leukemia seem to indicate a similar situation. Mice exhibiting preleukemic histological features already excrete increased amounts of various modified nucleosides and bases. Confirmation of our results by analysis of further irradiation-exposed mice in our present detailed time-course studies and of tumors experimentally induced in other organs of mice and other species will be taken as a basis for developing an in vivo test for carcinogenicity.

The enzyme complex provides for the cellular regulation of enzymatic activities by physical interaction of the proteins with each other and by prior alteration of one enzyme's substrate by a related enzyme. Such regulatory abilities may go awry in neoplasia. Components of the protein biosynthetic machinery, such as aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases, have been thought to exist freely in the cytoplasm. However, high-molecular-weight enzyme complexes with aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase activities have been found in mammalian cells. We have been the first to report that the mammalian cell enzymes responsible for modification of tRNA occur in enzyme complexes (molecular weight 900000 daltons) associated with aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases and that the activities of these enzymes differ in normal and leukemic cells. Thus the enzymes responsible for the methylation of tRNA occur in enzyme complexes that provide efficient maturation of tRNA and possible regulation of protein synthesis. In FLC cells a unique enzyme complex composed of tRNA-methyltransferase and aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase activities has also been shown to contain a specific ribonuclease activity and a cysteine-tRNA sulfurtransferase activity. Sulfurtransferase activity has been characterized and optimized for its tRNA and cysteine substrates and mercaptoethanol and cation cofactors. Abnormal activity of this enzyme during neoplasia could result in improper acylation of tRNA and/or infidelity of coding by tRNA. Specific RNase is important in the sizing of percursor tRNA into mature tRNA. Results showed that this sizing was dependent upon the presence of the enzyme complex and the length of the incubation time. Many of the 20 aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases are also found in the complex. Electron microscopy has verified the subunit nature of the complex, seen previously by density gradient centrifugation and gel filtration. Three subunits, each of 300 000 daltons, comprise a complex approximately 200 A in diameter.","['Agris, P F', 'Playl, T', 'Goldman, L', 'Horton, E', 'Woolverton, D', 'Setzer, D', 'Rodi, C']","['Agris PF', 'Playl T', 'Goldman L', 'Horton E', 'Woolverton D', 'Setzer D', 'Rodi C']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Germany,Recent Results Cancer Res,Recent results in cancer research.

The rate of 3H-thymidine incorporation is affected by two factors; inhibition and resumption of replicon initiation, and chain elongation. A simple method has been developed for estimating the amount of thymidine incorporation which is accounted for by DNA chain elongation after irradiation. This then allows an analysis of the inhibition and resumption of replicon initiation caused by X-rays. The method is based on knowledge of the rate of DNA chain elongation and of the distribution of replicon sizes which are determined by fiber autoradiography. The duration of the inhibition of replicon initiation and the initial slope of the curve showing recovery of initiation were obtained by subtracting the DNA synthesis due to chain elongation from the overall rate of 3H-thymidine incorporation. The interval of depressed DNA synthesis increased with increasing dose of X-rays but only gradually at doses higher than 500 rad. The interval did not exceed 60 min even after 5,000 rad.

The inhibition of transforming activity due to HpaII methylation was reversed by treatment of the transfected cells with 5-azacytidine, a specific inhibitor of methylation. Analysis of the genomic DNA from the transformed cells which resulted from the transfection of methylated MSV DNA revealed that the integrated MSV proviral DNA was sensitive to HpaII digestion in all cell lines examined, suggesting that loss of methyl groups was necessary for transformation. When cells were infected with Moloney murine leukemia virus at various times after transfection with methylated MSV DNA, the amount of transforming virus produced indicated that the loss of methyl groups occurred within 24 h. Methylation of MSV DNA at HhaI sites was as inhibitory to transforming activity as methylation at HpaII sites. In addition, methylation at both HpaII and HhaI sites did not further reduce the transforming activity of the DNA. These results suggested that; whereas methylation of specific sites on the provirus may not be essential for inhibiting the transforming activity of MSV DNA, methylation of specific regions may be necessary. Thus, by cotransfection of plasmids containing only specific regions of the MSV provirus, it was determined that methylation of the v-mos gene was more inhibitory to transformation than methylation of the viral long terminal repeat.","['McGeady, M L', 'Jhappan, C', 'Ascione, R', 'Vande Woude, G F']","['McGeady ML', 'Jhappan C', 'Ascione R', 'Vande Woude GF']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,"['0 (DNA, Viral)', 'EC 2.1.1.- (DNA modification methylase HhaI)', 'EC 2.1.1.- (DNA modification methylase HpaII)', 'EC 2.1.1.- (DNA-Cytosine Methylases)', 'EC 2.1.1.37 (DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferases)']",IM,"['Animals', '*Cell Transformation, Viral', 'DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferases/metabolism', 'DNA, Viral/*metabolism', '*DNA-Cytosine Methylases', 'Methylation', 'Mice', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/*genetics', 'Virus Replication']",1983/03/01 00:00,1983/03/01 00:01,['1983/03/01 00:00'],"['1983/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1983/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1983/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/mcb.3.3.305-314.1983 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 1983 Mar;3(3):305-14. doi: 10.1128/mcb.3.3.305-314.1983.,['IF32CA06762-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,PMC368539,,,,,,,,

The nuclei and the chromatin were then digested to various extents with micrococcal nuclease and the resulting mono- and dinucleosome fractions of the two preparations were compared. During progressive digestion mononucleosomes from chromatin retained H1 histone and a DNA length of 165 base pairs, whereas those from nuclei released H1 histone and the length of their DNA decreased to 140 base pairs at an early stage of digestion. These nucleosomal preparations were always associated with nonhistone proteins. The dinucleosomes from nuclei contained larger amounts of nonhistone proteins than those from chromatin, but half of these proteins was released during the process of cleavage into mononucleosomes. The final mononucleosome preparation from nuclei retained 20% less nonhistone proteins than that from chromatin. The contents of nonhistone proteins in mono- and dinucleosomes from chromatin were the same. The electrophoretical distributions of molecular species of nonhistone proteins in mononucleosomes from nuclei and chromatin were different from each other: during digestion the profile of the former changed, whereas that of the latter remained constant. It is tentatively concluded that both H1 histone and nonhistone proteins were bound to nucleosomes more or less loosely in intact nuclei in situ, but that when the nuclear structure was disrupted these proteins became more tightly bound.","['Ohba, Y', 'Toyoda, K']","['Ohba Y', 'Toyoda K']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,J Biochem,Journal of biochemistry,0376600,"['0 (Chromatin)', '0 (Chromosomal Proteins, Non-Histone)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Histones)', '0 (Nucleosomes)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Base Composition', 'Cell Fractionation/methods', 'Cell Nucleus/*ultrastructure', 'Chromatin/*ultrastructure', 'Chromosomal Proteins, Non-Histone/analysis', 'DNA, Neoplasm/analysis', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'Histones/analysis', 'Leukemia L5178/analysis', 'Mice', 'Molecular Weight', 'Nucleosomes/ultrastructure']",1983/02/01 00:00,1983/02/01 00:01,['1983/02/01 00:00'],"['1983/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1983/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1983/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/oxfordjournals.jbchem.a134206 [doi]'],ppublish,J Biochem. 1983 Feb;93(2):513-23. doi: 10.1093/oxfordjournals.jbchem.a134206.,,,,,,,,,,,,

In addition, it addresses the area of dis-synchrony, which causes stress for many patients. The author focuses on the area of dis-synchrony because she believes that social workers must be clear about the differences between reactions of pathological patients and strong reactions of psychologically normal patients to extraordinary circumstances. The literature on stress has begun to look at this aspect but is still open to a pathology bias. The social work profession needs to evolve new ways of thinking about normal people and their environments. The unique access that social workers have to the range of patients in a variety of settings creates the opportunity for them to make a significant contribution to the understanding of the full range of human experiences. Moreover, the sharing of knowledge between workers in mental health settings and those in medical settings is relevant not only in the provision of direct service, but also in the development of hospital policies and national policies regarding health care for individuals and their families.","['Christ, G H']",['Christ GH'],['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",United States,Health Soc Work,Health & social work,7611528,,IM,"['Adult', 'Female', 'Hospital Departments/*organization & administration', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/psychology', '*Life Change Events', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms/*psychology', 'Schizophrenic Psychology', '*Social Work, Psychiatric']",1983/01/01 00:00,1983/01/01 00:01,['1983/01/01 00:00'],"['1983/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1983/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1983/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/hsw/8.1.57 [doi]'],ppublish,Health Soc Work. 1983 Winter;8(1):57-64. doi: 10.1093/hsw/8.1.57.,,,,,,,,,,,,

After fixation and incubation with RNase, DNA in situ is partially denatured by acid and the cells are stained with acridine orange (AO). Staining with AO under these conditions reveals the extent of denatured versus double stranded DNA and enables one to distinguish mitotic from interphase cells. It is observed that all BrdUrd treated cells, regardless of cell cycle phase, have decreased both green and red fluorescence. This finding suggests that BrdUrd interacts with AO not only in the complexes of the dye with double stranded DNA, but also with the single stranded biopolymer. The BrdUrd-attributed suppression of cell fluorescence is large enough to separate totally BrdUrd labeled from unlabeled mitotic populations. The combination of these two flow cytometric techniques, one which allows discrimination between interphase and metaphase cells and the other which allows further subdivision of metaphase cells into those which have incorporated BrdUrd and those which have not, provides an alternative to the autoradiographic procedure necessary for obtaining the fraction of labeled mitoses.","['Darzynkiewicz, Z', 'Traganos, F', 'Melamed, M R']","['Darzynkiewicz Z', 'Traganos F', 'Melamed MR']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cytometry,Cytometry,8102328,"['F30N4O6XVV (Acridine Orange)', 'G34N38R2N1 (Bromodeoxyuridine)']",IM,"['Acridine Orange', 'Animals', 'Bromodeoxyuridine/*metabolism', '*Flow Cytometry', 'Friend murine leukemia virus', 'Leukemia, Experimental/pathology', '*Mitosis']",1983/03/01 00:00,1983/03/01 00:01,['1983/03/01 00:00'],"['1983/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1983/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1983/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/cyto.990030507 [doi]'],ppublish,Cytometry. 1983 Mar;3(5):345-8. doi: 10.1002/cyto.990030507.,"['CA14134/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA23296/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA28704/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,

There are neither specific changes in karyogram nor in alkaline phosphatase positivity. B) Idiopathic myeloproliferative syndrome is characterized (in comparison to A) by dysplastic changes especially in megakaryocytic line; it develops slowly tending to malignancy, namely leukemia or erythroleukemia that keep (unlike spontaneous leukemia) more severe dysplastic changes of megakaryocytes. Alkaline phosphatase is increased, atypical karyogram is not changed in Ph 1 region. C) Malignant neoplastic myeloproliferation of panmyelosis type is a primary destructive process akin to myelosis. Alkaline phosphatase is decreased, there are typical Ph 1 changes in karyogram and tumorous lymph node infiltration. Secondary myeloproliferative syndrome follows rarely and a mixed picture can be observed then, of course without severe megakaryocytic dysplasia. D) Myelofibrosis is an uncharacteristic final picture of various origin which neither develops in myeloproliferative syndrome or substitutionary extramedullar hemopoesis. Hesitation in oncological typing of idiopathic myeloproliferative syndrome cannot influence its nosological individuality.

Culture of bone marrow cells in medium supporting long-term generation of myeloid cells resulted in a rapid loss of NK activity in 1-3 days. In contrast, antibody-dependent cytotoxicity to an NK-resistant tumor was maintained for more than 7 weeks. Horse serum, a component of the myelopoietic culture medium, was found to diminish NK cytotoxicity of blood and bone marrow cultures whereas hydrocortisone supplement did not. In addition, an adherent cell is present in bone marrow which greatly inhibits NK activity. Nonadherent bone marrow cells exhibited higher cytotoxicity than unfractionated cells at all days of culture; adherent cells were not cytotoxic to K562. Purified adherent marrow cells inhibited the cytotoxic capacity of nonadherent blood or marrow mononuclear cells during coculture. Indomethacin, an inhibitor of protaglandin synthesis, augmented levels of NK activity in cultures of bone marrow cells, indicating that macrophages may be suppressing this effector function via prostaglandins. Further identification of the adherent suppressor cells came from experiments in which suppression was prevented by treatment of the adherent cells with monoclonal OKM1 antibody plus complement. This study shows that bone marrow-adherent OKM1-positive cells, presumably macrophages, negatively regulate NK activity, and it defines conditions for analysis of the generation and/or positive regulation of NK cells in human bone marrow.","['Punjabi, C J', 'Moore, M A', 'Ralph, P']","['Punjabi CJ', 'Moore MA', 'Ralph P']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Netherlands,Cell Immunol,Cellular immunology,1246405,['XXE1CET956 (Indomethacin)'],IM,"['Antibody-Dependent Cell Cytotoxicity', '*Bone Marrow Cells', 'Cell Adhesion', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Humans', 'Immune Tolerance', 'Indomethacin/pharmacology', 'Killer Cells, Natural/cytology/*immunology', 'Lymphocyte Depletion', 'Monocytes/immunology', 'Time Factors']",1983/04/01 00:00,1983/04/01 00:01,['1983/04/01 00:00'],"['1983/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1983/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1983/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0008-8749(83)90002-3 [pii]', '10.1016/0008-8749(83)90002-3 [doi]']",ppublish,Cell Immunol. 1983 Apr 1;77(1):13-22. doi: 10.1016/0008-8749(83)90002-3.,"['AI-15811/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-09149-07/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-19052/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,

Several of the more effective anions and their respective inhibition constants (Ki values) were: 5-methyltetrahydrofolate (0.3 microM), bromosulfophthalein (2 microM), thiamine pyrophosphate (3 microM), 8-anilino-1-naphthalene sulfonate (7 microM), phthalate (20 microM), and AMP (50 microM). Moderate inhibition was observed with Pi (Ki = 400 microM) and other divalent inorganic anions, while small monovalent anions such as Cl- (Ki = 30 mM) were the least effective. When these same anions were tested for an effect on methotrexate efflux, stimulation was observed with some anions, while others had no effect. Enhancement was produced by folate compounds and p-amino-benzoylglutamate, small monovalent (e.g., Cl-, acetate, and lactate) and divalent (e.g., phosphate and succinate) anions, a few nucleotides (e.g., AMP), and thiamine pyrophosphate, while little or no effect was associated with trivalent anions (e.g., citrate), most nucleotides, and large organic anions (e.g., bromosulfophthalein, NAD, and NADP). Anions with the ability to promote methotrexate efflux in control cells lost this capacity upon exposure of the cells to an irreversible inhibitor of methotrexate influx. These results support the hypothesis that methotrexate transport proceeds via an anion-exchange mechanism and moreover provide evidence that anion substrates for this system can be identified by their ability to promote methotrexate efflux. Anions which appear most likely to participate in this exchange cycle in vivo are Pi and AMP.","['Henderson, G B', 'Zevely, E M']","['Henderson GB', 'Zevely EM']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Arch Biochem Biophys,Archives of biochemistry and biophysics,0372430,"['0 (Anions)', '0 (Buffers)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Anions/*metabolism', 'Biological Transport', 'Buffers/pharmacology', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia L1210/*metabolism', 'Methotrexate/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Substrate Specificity']",1983/03/01 00:00,1983/03/01 00:01,['1983/03/01 00:00'],"['1983/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1983/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1983/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0003-9861(83)90162-5 [pii]', '10.1016/0003-9861(83)90162-5 [doi]']",ppublish,Arch Biochem Biophys. 1983 Mar;221(2):438-46. doi: 10.1016/0003-9861(83)90162-5.,"['CA23970/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA6522/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,

The LGL leukemia is the major cause of death of aging F344 rats. Morphologically, the LGL leukemias were composed of cells with either pleomorphic nuclei with many intracytoplasmic granules or round nuclei with few intracytoplasmic granules. The granules appeared to be lysosomes containing beta-glucuronidase and acid phosphatase and ultrastructurally developed in association with vesicles in the Golgi apparatus. Splenic natural killer cell activity against YAC-1 cells varied from case to case, and it appeared to be associated with LGL leukemia cells. Some transplantable leukemias had stable NK activity. Fluorescence-activated cell sorter (FACS) analysis of surface antigens revealed the LGL leukemias to be heterogeneous, and there was no correlation between cytotoxic activity and cell surface antigens. Although the morphologic features of cells in LGL leukemias resemble those of normal rat LGLs, differences in cytotoxic activity and surface antigens suggest that LGL tumors represent a heterogeneous group of leukemias which may serve as a model for the study of origin and lineage of normal LGL and NK cells.","['Ward, J M', 'Reynolds, C W']","['Ward JM', 'Reynolds CW']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Am J Pathol,The American journal of pathology,0370502,"['0 (Antigens, Surface)']",IM,"['Aging', 'Animals', 'Antigens, Surface/analysis', 'Killer Cells, Natural/immunology', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/immunology/pathology/*veterinary', 'Male', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Rats', 'Rats, Inbred F344', 'Rodent Diseases/immunology/*pathology']",1983/04/01 00:00,1983/04/01 00:01,['1983/04/01 00:00'],"['1983/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1983/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1983/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Am J Pathol. 1983 Apr;111(1):1-10.,,,,PMC1916195,,,,,,,,

Two groups, called Ea and Eb, consist of N-tropic viruses related to the standard endogenous ecotropic virus of AKR mice. Ea viruses replicate with reduced efficiency in cell lines derived from C3H mice, while Eb viruses essentially replicate normally in these cells. As elsewhere reported, Ea viruses appear apathogenic in C3H mice, while Eb viruses cause a moderate incidence of late leukemias. The biological differences are associated with modulations of the fine structure of the gag gene-encoded proteins. A third group of viruses, called Ec, is clearly more diverged. They differ extensively from Ea and Eb viruses in the products of the gag and env gene, and are related to Rauscher leukemia virus. Ec viruses are NB-ecotropic; they replicate efficiently in all mouse cells tested, and induce leukemias in C3H mice with shorter latency periods than Eb viruses. Since published nucleic acid hybridization data indicate that DBA/2 mice only carry one ecotropic provirus, we assume that the DBA/2 viruses represent a developmental series of variants evolving during the life of the animals.","['Nexo, B A', 'Ulrich, K']","['Nexo BA', 'Ulrich K']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Virology,Virology,0110674,"['0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)', '0 (Viral Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Disease Susceptibility', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Inbred C3H', 'Mice, Inbred DBA', 'Molecular Weight', 'Retroviridae/*isolation & purification/physiology', 'Species Specificity', 'Viral Envelope Proteins', 'Viral Proteins/*analysis', 'Virus Replication']",1983/03/01 00:00,1983/03/01 00:01,['1983/03/01 00:00'],"['1983/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1983/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1983/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1016/0042-6822(83)90216-7 [doi]'],ppublish,Virology. 1983 Mar;125(2):454-67. doi: 10.1016/0042-6822(83)90216-7.,,,,,,,,,,,,

These include a major species designated gp52 and its processed form which is designated gp65. The SFFV glycoproteins were found to be predominantly intracellular, although a portion of gp65 is expressed on the cell surface. gp65 was observed to be highly sialylated and resistant to digestion with endoglycosidase-H (endo-H). In contrast, gp52 was endo-H sensitive and the polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis profile of the endo-H digests suggested the presence of four glycosylation sites. Analysis of tryptic glycopeptides from gp52 by reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography also suggested the presence of four glycosylation sites. Glycopeptide analysis of Pronase digests of gp52 revealed two major size classes with molecular weights of 2200 and 1500, which correspond to two of the four oligosaccharide size classes reported previously for MuLV gp70's (M.C. Kemp, N.G. Famulari, P.V. O'Donnell, and R.W. Compans, 1980, J. Virol. 34, 154). Both glycopeptide size classes were sensitive to digestion with endo-H. The glycopeptide profile of gp65 was found to be very heterogeneous and the predominant form was a 2900-dalton size class. In addition a fucosyl glycopeptide of 2500 daltons was observed in gp65, but not in F-MuLV or F-MCF glycoproteins. In the presence of the sodium ionophore monensin, the processing of gp52 to gp65 was inhibited. Instead a smaller protein of about 60,000 daltons was observed, which did not arrive at the cell surface, a situation analogous to the processing and post-translational modification reported for gp52 from anemic isolates of SFFV (S.K. Ruscetti, J.A. Field, and E.M.

A light microscopic and ultrastructural study of a new prognostic parameter.,5-12,"Peripheral blood lymphocytes from 48 consecutive, newly diagnosed CLL patients were examined by light- and electron-microscopy for the presence of nuclear cleaving or folding. On this basis, the patients could be subdivided into 2 easily separable morphological groups. In 42 patients the lymphocytes had regular round nuclei. In 6 patients (13%) the lymphocytes of peripheral blood had a highly irregular nuclear outline characterized by pronounced cleaving or folding of the nuclear membrane. In 4 of these 6 patients immunological investigations demonstrated membrane markers consistent with B-cell monoclonality. Age, sex, distribution between stages as well as mode of clinical presentation were all alike in the 2 groups of patients. In spite of this a statistically significant, highly increased mortality was observed in patients with lymphocyte nuclear irregularities. Thus, 50% of all deaths occurred in this small group of patients. These findings indicate that lymphocyte nuclear cleaving or folding represents a stage-independent prognostic parameter, which permits selection of a small but easily identified high-risk group of patients.","['Ralfkiaer, E', 'Geisler, C', 'Hansen, M M', 'Hou-Jensen, K']","['Ralfkiaer E', 'Geisler C', 'Hansen MM', 'Hou-Jensen K']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Denmark,Scand J Haematol,Scandinavian journal of haematology,0404507,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*blood/pathology/ultrastructure', 'Lymphocytes/*ultrastructure', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Nuclear Envelope/ultrastructure', 'Prognosis']",1983/01/01 00:00,1983/01/01 00:01,['1983/01/01 00:00'],"['1983/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1983/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1983/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1600-0609.1983.tb00628.x [doi]'],ppublish,Scand J Haematol. 1983 Jan;30(1):5-12. doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0609.1983.tb00628.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,

HTLV is closely linked to a subtype of adult T-cell malignancies and except for isolated cases, has not been found associated with any other form of leukaemia, lymphoma or other cancers (see refs 1, 2 for review). HTLV can be transmitted to cord blood T lymphocytes in vitro and the infected cells exhibit characteristics of transformed neoplastic T cells. We have recently cloned DNA sequences derived from approximately 1 kilobase (kb) of the 5' and 3' termini of the HTLV genome, as well as a 4-5-kb defective HTLV provirus flanked by cellular sequences. The availability of these probes has enabled us to carry out a limited survey of different fresh or cultured cells from patients of different lymphoid and myeloid malignancies for HTLV-related DNA sequences. The results presented here show that cells from all Japanese patients with adult T-cell leukaemia and several patients with various mature T-cell malignancies from elsewhere contained one or more copies of a highly conserved HTLV genome. The infected cells are of clonal origin. Fresh cells from 1 of the 10 myeloid leukaemic patients contained exogenous DNA sequences distantly related to HTLV.","['Wong-Staal, F', 'Hahn, B', 'Manzari, V', 'Colombini, S', 'Franchini, G', 'Gelmann, E P', 'Gallo, R C']","['Wong-Staal F', 'Hahn B', 'Manzari V', 'Colombini S', 'Franchini G', 'Gelmann EP', 'Gallo RC']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Nature,Nature,0410462,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (DNA, Viral)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Cell Line', 'DNA, Neoplasm/*isolation & purification', 'DNA, Viral/*isolation & purification', 'Genes, Viral', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/genetics/*microbiology', 'Plasmids', 'Retroviridae/*genetics/isolation & purification']",1983/04/14 00:00,1983/04/14 00:01,['1983/04/14 00:00'],"['1983/04/14 00:00 [pubmed]', '1983/04/14 00:01 [medline]', '1983/04/14 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/302626a0 [doi]'],ppublish,Nature. 1983 Apr 14;302(5909):626-8. doi: 10.1038/302626a0.,,,,,,,,,,,,

Simultaneously, the turnover of labelled lymphocytes in the peripheral blood was evaluated. From another CLL patient a regional lymph node was removed 6 h after an intralymphatic flash injection of [3H] thymidine and sectioned for autoradiographic study of the distribution of labelled cells within the lymph node tissue. While the durations of DNA synthesis were found to be normal, the labelling indices were reduced. The relative cell production rate was far lower than normal. Very small growth fractions were calculated, amounting to less than 1% in one patient, and to 2.4% in the other. The distribution of labelled cells in the lymph nodes was focal, which supports the finding of low growth fractions. According to the present data, CLL is a disorder in which a very small number of cells cycle at a roughly normal rate. A kinetic definition of accumulative and proliferative tumour growth is introduced. Tumour growth is termed accumulative if growth appears to result from a decreased relative cell loss rate rather than an increased relative cell production rate. According to this definition, the kinetics in CLL may be classified as accumulative. In absolute terms, however, the number of lymphoid cells produced per unit of time was found to be far higher in CLL than in the healthy state.","['Dormer, P', 'Theml, H', 'Lau, B']","['Dormer P', 'Theml H', 'Lau B']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,,IM,"['Aged', 'Cell Division', 'Cell Survival', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*pathology', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Lymph Nodes/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged']",1983/01/01 00:00,1983/01/01 00:01,['1983/01/01 00:00'],"['1983/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1983/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1983/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0145-2126(83)90052-8 [pii]', '10.1016/0145-2126(83)90052-8 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 1983;7(1):1-10. doi: 10.1016/0145-2126(83)90052-8.,,,,,,,,,,,,

A statistically significant reduction in pneumonia, upper respiratory tract infection, periproctitis and skin abscesses was also observed in Groups A and B. As to the causative organisms, a relative increase in incidence of infections caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Escherichia coli and a decrease in those caused by Proteus and fungi were observed in Groups A and B, as compared with Group C.

Moreover, this reactive antigen is acquired on neuroendocrine thymic epithelium during thymic ontogeny--first appearing on fetal thymic epithelial cells between 8 and 15 wk gestation. While only a portion of thymic epithelial cells in the subcapsular cortical region of 15- and 24-wk fetal thymuses contained anti-p19+ epithelial cells, the entire subcapsular cortical region of newborn thymus epithelium was anti-p19+. By age 3 yr, normal subjects' entire subcapsular cortical and medullary thymic epithelium was anti-p19+. Using antibody against HTLV core protein, p24, and c-DNA probes for HTLV DNA, neither HTLV-specific p24 protein nor proviral DNA could be demonstrated in anti-p19+ thymic epithelial tissue. However, thymic epithelial extracts, disrupted HTLV extracts, as well as purified HTLV p19 antigen all inhibited the binding of anti-p19 antibody to thymic epithelium. Thus, anti-p19 may recognize a determinant on an HTLV-encoded 19,000-dalton structural protein that is shared by human thymic epithelium. Alternatively, anti-p19 defines a host encoded protein that is selectively expressed by normal thymic epithelium, and is induced to be expressed in HTLV-infected malignant T cells.","['Haynes, B F', 'Robert-Guroff, M', 'Metzgar, R S', 'Franchini, G', 'Kalyanaraman, V S', 'Palker, T J', 'Gallo, R C']","['Haynes BF', 'Robert-Guroff M', 'Metzgar RS', 'Franchini G', 'Kalyanaraman VS', 'Palker TJ', 'Gallo RC']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Exp Med,The Journal of experimental medicine,2985109R,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Thymopoietins)', '0 (thymus-leukemia antigens)', '61512-21-8 (Thymosin)', 'W0B22ISQ1C (Thymalfasin)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/*analysis', 'Antigen-Antibody Reactions', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/analysis/*immunology', 'Binding Sites, Antibody', 'Cell Membrane/immunology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cytoplasm/immunology', 'DNA, Neoplasm/analysis', 'Epithelium/immunology', 'Female', 'Humans', '*Membrane Glycoproteins', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Proteins/analysis', 'Pregnancy', 'Rabbits', 'Retroviridae/immunology', 'Thymalfasin', 'Thymopoietins/analysis', 'Thymosin/analogs & derivatives/analysis', 'Thymus Gland/embryology/*immunology', 'Tumor Virus Infections/genetics/*immunology']",1983/03/01 00:00,1983/03/01 00:01,['1983/03/01 00:00'],"['1983/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1983/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1983/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1084/jem.157.3.907 [doi]'],ppublish,J Exp Med. 1983 Mar 1;157(3):907-20. doi: 10.1084/jem.157.3.907.,"['CA 08975/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 11265/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 28936/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,PMC2186953,,,,,,,,

Injection of RMuLV, either intravenously or intraperitoneally, rapidly induced thrombocytopenia, possibly as a result of direct interaction between platelets and viral particles. The susceptibility to this acute thrombocytopenia was genetically controlled and was inherited as a dominant trait. Murine strains with H-2d or H-2k haplotype, which are susceptible to the induction of leukemia by RMuLV, developed thrombocytopenia, whereas leukemia-resistant H-2b and H-2q strains of mice failed to develop thrombocytopenia. Using B10 H-2-congenic and intra-H-2-recombinant mice, it was shown that the susceptibility to RMuLV-induced thrombocytopenia was controlled by gene(s) in or closely linked to the D region of the H-2 complex. Megakaryocytes may be one of the first sites for the replication of RMuLV. Indeed, among bone marrow cells, only megakaryocytes expressed viral antigens gp70 and p30 during the initial phase of RMuLV infection. In addition, megakaryocytes from infected mice were able to transfer preleukemic thrombocytopenia as well as leukemia in syngeneic mice. The infection of megakaryocytes by RMuLV appears to be genetically controlled in a manner similar to the induction of thrombocytopenia, since only the megakaryocytes from mice developing thrombocytopenia were infected by RMuLV. These results indicate that the gene(s) governing the induction of thrombocytopenia by RMuLV may be the same gene(s) (or closely linked to the gene) that controls the susceptibility to leukemogenesis, and would be consistent with the expression of the gene product, presumably a receptor-like molecule for RMuLV, on platelet and megakaryocyte membranes.","['Grau, G E', 'Puthavathana, P', 'Izui, S', 'Lambert, P H']","['Grau GE', 'Puthavathana P', 'Izui S', 'Lambert PH']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Exp Med,The Journal of experimental medicine,2985109R,"['0 (Antigens, Viral)', '0 (H-2 Antigens)', '0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)', '0 (Viral Proteins)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Animals', 'Antigens, Viral/analysis/genetics', 'Bone Marrow Cells', 'Disease Susceptibility', 'Female', 'H-2 Antigens/genetics/immunology', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Experimental/etiology/*genetics/immunology', 'Megakaryocytes/*immunology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Inbred C3H', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Inbred CBA', 'Mice, Inbred DBA', 'Rauscher Virus/immunology', 'Thrombocytopenia/etiology/*genetics/immunology', 'Viral Envelope Proteins', 'Viral Proteins/analysis']",1983/03/01 00:00,1983/03/01 00:01,['1983/03/01 00:00'],"['1983/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1983/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1983/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1084/jem.157.3.1028 [doi]'],ppublish,J Exp Med. 1983 Mar 1;157(3):1028-39. doi: 10.1084/jem.157.3.1028.,,,,PMC2186971,,,,,,,,

We investigated the mechanism of this antibody-induced alteration of leukemia cell phenotype in a series of passive transfer experiments using monoclonal antiviral antibodies. Our results indicated that two IgG2a anti-gp70 cytotoxic antibodies could reduce the frequency of virus-producing cells within the leukemic spleen as well as maintain the virus-nonproducing phenotype once it was established. IgG2a and IgG2b monoclonal anti-p 15 antibodies, IgM, and IgA anti-gp70 antibodies, and an IgG3 anti-p 15(E) antibody were not effective. The mechanism of this phenotypic alteration appeared to involve an antibody-mediated cytostasis of virus-producing leukemia cells with the subsequent over-growth of virus-nonproducing cells. The maintenance of the virus-nonproducing phenotype was dependent on the presence of anti-gp70 antibodies capable of neutralizing and clearing infectious F-MuLV in vivo. The presence of these neutralizing antibodies appeared to prevent reinfection of virus-nonproducing cells and therefore interfered with reversion to the virus-producing phenotype.","['Britt, W J', 'Chesebro, B']","['Britt WJ', 'Chesebro B']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antibodies, Viral)', '0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)', '0 (Viral Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/administration & dosage/*physiology', 'Antibodies, Viral/administration & dosage/*physiology', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'Friend murine leukemia virus/immunology', 'Immunization, Passive', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Experimental/genetics/*immunology/microbiology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred A', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Phenotype', 'Viral Envelope Proteins', 'Viral Proteins/*immunology']",1983/05/01 00:00,1983/05/01 00:01,['1983/05/01 00:00'],"['1983/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1983/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1983/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Immunol. 1983 May;130(5):2363-7.,,,,,,,,,,,,

Expression of cell surface (neuraminidase-releasable) sialic acid on IFN-treated cells was markedly elevated (three- to six-fold). The increase in neuraminidase-releasable sialic acid is contributed by sialoglycoproteins and particularly by cell-surface gangliosides in IFN-treated cells. Incorporation of [3H]-galactose into all GSL was elevated in IFN-treated cells. Thin-layer chromatographic analysis of GSL of IFN-treated cells showed an increase in several GSL homologues with striking changes in ganglioside with chromatographic migration of GM2, GM1, and GD1a relative to control cells. IFN-treated tumor-cell lines became resistant to lysis by virus-induced IFN-activated natural killer (NK) cells, as shown previously, but addition of neuraminidase to IFN-treated and untreated cells caused only a moderate increase in NK-sensitivity. This suggests that IFN-mediated protection of target cells from NK lysis was not due to a preferential masking of target structure by elevated levels of sialic acid. These membrane-associated changes in GSL and sialic acid in IFN-treated cells may be potentially significant, because a correlation between certain GSL expression, sialic acid phenotype and susceptibility of target cells to NK-cell-mediated lysis have been found in several other systems.","['Yogeeswaran, G', 'Gronberg, A', 'Welsh, R M', 'Kiessling, R']","['Yogeeswaran G', 'Gronberg A', 'Welsh RM', 'Kiessling R']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,"['0 (Glycosphingolipids)', '0 (Interferon Type I)', '0 (Sialic Acids)', 'X2RN3Q8DNE (Galactose)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Membrane/metabolism', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic/drug effects', 'Galactose/metabolism', 'Glycosphingolipids/*metabolism', 'Interferon Type I/*pharmacology', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*immunology', 'Leukemia L1210/*metabolism', 'Lymphoma/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred Strains', 'Neoplasms, Experimental/metabolism', 'Sialic Acids/*metabolism']",1983/04/15 00:00,1983/04/15 00:01,['1983/04/15 00:00'],"['1983/04/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1983/04/15 00:01 [medline]', '1983/04/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ijc.2910310417 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Cancer. 1983 Apr 15;31(4):501-7. doi: 10.1002/ijc.2910310417.,"['AI 17672/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'CA26782/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,

The mechanism of enhancement of VCR cytotoxicity was explained by the enhanced accumulation of VCR in K562, especially in resistant cells.","['Tsuruo, T', 'Iida, H', 'Tsukagoshi, S', 'Sakurai, Y']","['Tsuruo T', 'Iida H', 'Tsukagoshi S', 'Sakurai Y']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Calcium-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Calmodulin)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', 'CJ0O37KU29 (Verapamil)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Calcium/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Calcium-Binding Proteins/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Calmodulin/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Doxorubicin/*therapeutic use', 'Drug Synergism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Verapamil/pharmacology', 'Vincristine/*therapeutic use']",1983/05/01 00:00,1983/05/01 00:01,['1983/05/01 00:00'],"['1983/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1983/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1983/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1983 May;43(5):2267-72.,,,,,,,,,,,,

The requirement for spontaneous chemical transformation of these agents to exert anticancer activity was evaluated using as the prototype the most potent member of this class synthesized to date, the 3,4-dimethoxybenzene sulfonylhydrazone of 2-pyridinecarboxaldehyde 1-oxide (3,4-DSP. 3,4-DSP was chemically unstable, decomposing with a half-life of 19 min in 0.01 M potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) at 37 degrees. The major chemical decomposition product was identified as 2-pyridylcarbinol 1-oxide by comparison with the authentic compound. This carbinol is hypothesized to be formed via the intramolecular abstraction of hydrogen from the arylsulfonyl-hydrazone, a process that leads to the release of 3,4-dimethoxybenzenesulfinic acid and the formation of 1-oxidopyridin-2-yldiazomethane, which subsequently reacts with water. The diazomethane intermediate is a potent alkylating agent which, if generated in cells, would have the potential to alkylate nucleophilic groups of biologically important macromolecules. The proposed reactive species was trapped using both 4-(4-nitrobenzyl)pyridine (NBP) and morpholine, and the latter product was characterized by mass spectroscopy. The importance of the chemical formation of an alkylating species to cytotoxicity was demonstrated by studies in which solutions of 3,4-DSP were ""aged"" prior to addition to L1210 leukemia cells in culture and prior to incubation with NBP. The ""aging"" of 3,4-DSP for 20 min resulted in a 4-fold decrease in cytotoxicity, and aging for 1 to 3 hr led to complete loss of cytotoxicity. Correspondingly, a 20-min aging period decreased alkylation of NBP by 51%, and 3-hr aging resulted in essentially no alkylation of the nucleophile. Further support for the above proposed chemical activation pathway was provided by correlations between in vitro cytotoxicity, in vivo antineoplastic activity, chemical stability, and the degree of alkylation of NBP by a wide variety of arylsulfonyl-hydrazones. The lack of the 1-oxide, envisioned to be required for intramolecular hydrogen abstraction, the steric prevention of the abstraction, or the replacement of the proton of the nitrogrn of the side-chain by a methyl group resulted in a marked increase in chemical stability and a corresponding loss of the ability to alkylate NBP and to inhibit the replication of L1210 leukemia cells in culture.","['Shiba, D A', 'May, J A Jr', 'Sartorelli, A C']","['Shiba DA', 'May JA Jr', 'Sartorelli AC']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Alkylating Agents)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Hydrazones)', '0 (Pyridines)', '0Z6GS37N7H (4-(4-nitrobenzyl)pyridine)', '73736-93-3 (2-pyridinecarboxaldehyde-1-oxide-3,4-dimethoxybenzene', 'sulfonylhydrazone)', '9TF312056Y (Nicotinyl Alcohol)']",IM,"['Alkylating Agents', 'Animals', '*Antineoplastic Agents', 'Cell Division/*drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chemical Phenomena', 'Chemistry', 'Half-Life', 'Humans', 'Hydrazones/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia L1210/pathology', 'Mice', 'Nicotinyl Alcohol', 'Pyridines', 'Sarcoma, Experimental/pathology', 'Structure-Activity Relationship']",1983/05/01 00:00,2001/03/28 10:01,['1983/05/01 00:00'],"['1983/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1983/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1983 May;43(5):2023-9.,"['CA-02817/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-16359/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'GM-08797/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,

This relationship was maintained when using ara-A in the presence of the adenosine deaminase inhibitor deoxycoformycin. Furthermore, treatment with increasing concentrations of ara-A resulted in a greater proportion of ara-A residues at the 3'-terminus, consistent with this agent providing a poor primer terminus for elongating DNA strands.

The observed phenomenon of collateral sensitivity is associated with a significantly higher inhibition of the specific activity of carbamyl phosphate synthetase II, pyrimidine nucleoside kinases, adenine phosphoribosyl transferase, and hypoxanthine phosphoribosyl transferase in the PALA-sensitive line, P388/ACIA.

Moreover, the purine nucleotide pool demonstrated a significant expansion of adenosine triphosphate and guanosine triphosphate only in the P388/ACIA line following a similar treatment with PALA.

PBMC from healthy donors and from patients were cultured with and without 500 U of highly purified human fibroblast IFN/ml for 24 hr, and then their cytotoxic activity was assayed by a 5-hr 51Cr-release test. Of primary tumor cells isolated from patients, the cells of 5 of 15 patients with acute nonlymphocytic leukemia (ANLL), 5 of 9 patients with acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL), 2 of 3 patients with chronic phase chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), 2 of 3 patients with blastic phase CML, 1 patient with hairy cell leukemia, and 6 patients with diffuse non-Hodgkin's lymphoma were sensitive to IFN-activated PBMC of healthy donors, whereas the cells of 3 of the ANLL patients, 2 of the ALL patients, and 3 of the lymphoma patients were sensitive to unstimulated PBMC. Of the ANLL cells tested, myeloblasts, promyelocytes, and monoblasts were sensitive to either unstimulated or IFN-activated PBMC. Compared with the ANLL cells, the lymphoma cells were statistically significantly sensitive to activated effector cells (p less than 0.025). On the basis of the unlabeled target competition test and the recovery of cytotoxic cells within the fractions enriched in natural killer (NK) cells, NK cells appeared to mediate the above unstimulated and IFN-boosted cytotoxicity. In experiments using autologous effector-target cells from 11 patients, the addition of 500 U of IFN/ml enhanced the lytic activity of PBMC against autologous lymphoma cells in 1 patient, and higher concentrations of IFN, i.e., 2500 or 3500 U/ml, enhanced their cytotoxic activity against autologous leukemia or lymphoma cells in 4 of 8 patients. These data indicate that IFN-activated allogeneic PBMC are able to lyse both myeloid and lymphoid tumor cells, whereas higher concentrations of IFN are required to enhance lytic activity against autologous tumor cells.","['Oshimi, K', 'Oshimi, Y', 'Motoji, T', 'Kobayashi, S', 'Mizoguchi, H']","['Oshimi K', 'Oshimi Y', 'Motoji T', 'Kobayashi S', 'Mizoguchi H']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,['0 (Interferon Type I)'],IM,"['Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Humans', 'Immunologic Surveillance', 'Interferon Type I/*immunology', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*immunology', 'Leukemia/*immunology', 'Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Lymphoma/*immunology']",1983/04/01 00:00,1983/04/01 00:01,['1983/04/01 00:00'],"['1983/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1983/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1983/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)85641-9 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1983 Apr;61(4):790-8.,,,,,,,,,,,,

If not exposed to EP, the erythroid cells divide for about 120 hr in culture, and they maintain the potential for full differentiation in response to EP added at any time during the period from 72 to 120 hr. Between 96 and 120 hr of culture without added EP, the EP-sensitive erythroid precursor cells that have formed discrete erythroid bursts can be isolated in relatively large numbers from such cultures by plucking with a Pasteur pipette. The addition of EP initiates the final stages of erythroid differentiation, including heme synthesis in 70%-80% of these isolated cells. With respect to homogeneity of the precursor cells, quantity of EP-responsive cells obtainable, and uniformity of EP responsiveness, this system is uniquely favorable for biochemical studies of the late differentiation effects of EP. The overall changes in gene expression accompanying EP-induced terminal differentiation were examined by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis of proteins labeled for a short time with radioactive amino acids. Several new proteins are synthesized in these erythroid cells during terminal differentiation, but the number is a very small percentage of the total number of proteins being made. Thus, in this system, the effect of EP is to initiate expression of a small group of genes, including those for globins, spectrin, and other proteins involved in the final stages of erythroid differentiation.","['Bondurant, M', 'Koury, M', 'Krantz, S B', 'Blevins, T', 'Duncan, D T']","['Bondurant M', 'Koury M', 'Krantz SB', 'Blevins T', 'Duncan DT']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,['11096-26-7 (Erythropoietin)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Bone Marrow Cells', 'Cell Differentiation/*drug effects', 'Cell Separation', '*Cell Transformation, Viral', 'Cells, Cultured', '*Erythropoiesis', 'Erythropoietin/*pharmacology', '*Friend murine leukemia virus', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*drug effects', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Time Factors']",1983/04/01 00:00,1983/04/01 00:01,['1983/04/01 00:00'],"['1983/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1983/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1983/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)85635-3 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1983 Apr;61(4):751-8.,"['R01 AM-15555/AM/NIADDK NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 AM-07186/AM/NIADDK NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,

The presence of L.1 in mouse blood was demonstrated up to 15 days after the inoculation. On the other hand, in vivo administration of L.1 was probably accompanied by loss of the cytotoxic activity, perhaps through a mechanism of complement inactivation, since the presence of undiluted normal mouse serum in a CDC assay inhibited the cytotoxic activity of L.1. Moreover, serum from L.1-treated mice did not display any cytotoxic activity, although the presence of the antibody could be demonstrated by indirect immunofluorescence.

A potential influence of intracellular and extracellular pH on cytotoxic, mutagenic, carcinogenic, and teratogenic potencies of other chemicals is also suggested.

Four major cell types of leukemia were considered. Acute lymphatic leukemia had a bimodal distribution with the first peak in the 5-9-year age group and lowest rates in age group 35-44, after which rates rose geometrically. Acute myeloid leukemia had only a very small childhood peak with a low in the age group 5-9, after which the rates also rose geometrically. For both chronic lymphatic and myeloid leukemia the rates rose geometrically after age 15. Rates among females were consistently lower for each age group. The highest sex ratio was found for chronic lymphatic leukemia and is proposed to be the result of a lag period between male and female rates. During the period under study acute lymphatic leukemia mortality in adults declined by almost 10% while acute myeloid leukemia mortality increased by almost 20%. Analysis of the geographic variation of the four major cell types revealed a geographic association between acute lymphatic and acute myeloid leukemia in children, a lack of association between childhood and adult cell types, and an association of acute and chronic cell types in adults.","['Selvin, S', 'Levin, L I', 'Merrill, D W', 'Winkelstein, W Jr']","['Selvin S', 'Levin LI', 'Merrill DW', 'Winkelstein W Jr']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Am J Epidemiol,American journal of epidemiology,7910653,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Epidemiologic Methods', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia/*mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Sex Factors', 'Statistics as Topic', 'United States']",1983/02/01 00:00,2001/03/28 10:01,['1983/02/01 00:00'],"['1983/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1983/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/oxfordjournals.aje.a113524 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Epidemiol. 1983 Feb;117(2):140-52. doi: 10.1093/oxfordjournals.aje.a113524.,['5T32 CA 09348/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,

Two monosaccharides, D-mannose and N-acetyl-D-galactosamine, were found to decrease cytotoxicity consistently in a dose-dependent manner. However, D-mannose preferentially inhibited lysis of RL male I target cells with little effect on lysis of L5178Y target cells, while the reverse was found with N-acetyl-D-galactosamine. Neither monosaccharide interfered with the activation of macrophages by polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid. Natural killer cell activity was decreased by a 25 mM concentration of D-mannose but not by N-acetyl-D-galactosamine, although increasing concentrations of N-acetyl-D-galactosamine were inhibitory. Neither monosaccharide affected cytotoxicity by alloimmune T cells. Cytotoxicity of macrophage-like cell lines against tumor target cells was also decreased by monosaccharides but the pattern of inhibition was different from that seen with activated macrophage effector cells. Both D-mannose and N-acetyl-D-galactosamine inhibited glucose oxidation by activated macrophages but only D-mannose significantly decreased protein synthesis of activated macrophages. These results indicate that monosaccharides can inhibit macrophage-mediated cytotoxicity in a selective manner with the pattern dependent on the tumor target cell used in the assay.","['Brunda, M J', 'Wiltrout, R H', 'Holden, H T', 'Varesio, L']","['Brunda MJ', 'Wiltrout RH', 'Holden HT', 'Varesio L']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,['0 (Monosaccharides)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic/*drug effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Killer Cells, Natural/drug effects/*immunology', 'Leukemia L5178/*immunology', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*immunology', 'Macrophages/drug effects/*immunology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Nude', 'Monosaccharides/*pharmacology']",1983/03/15 00:00,1983/03/15 00:01,['1983/03/15 00:00'],"['1983/03/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1983/03/15 00:01 [medline]', '1983/03/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ijc.2910310319 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Cancer. 1983 Mar 15;31(3):373-9. doi: 10.1002/ijc.2910310319.,,,,,,,,,,,,

Experiments were performed to investigate whether homozygosity at the Mov loci would be compatible with normal development. Animals heterozygous at an Mov locus were mated, and the genotype of the offspring was analyzed. From parents heterozygous at the loci Mov1 to Mov12, respectively, homozygous offspring were obtained with the expected Mendelian frequency. In contrast, no homozygous offspring or embryos older than day 15 of gestation were obtained from parents heterozygous at the Mov13 locus. When pregnant Mov13 females at day 13 and day 14 of gestation were analyzed, approximately 25% of the embryos were degenerated. Genotyping revealed that these degenerated embryos were invariably homozygous and the normal appearing embryos were either heterozygous or negative for M-MuLV. These results suggest that integration of M-MuLV at the Mov13 locus leads to insertion mutagenesis, resulting in embryonic arrest between day 12 and day 13 of gestation. It is possible that the Mov13 locus represents a gene or gene complex involved in the early embryonic development of the mouse.","['Jaenisch, R', 'Harbers, K', 'Schnieke, A', 'Lohler, J', 'Chumakov, I', 'Jahner, D', 'Grotkopp, D', 'Hoffmann, E']","['Jaenisch R', 'Harbers K', 'Schnieke A', 'Lohler J', 'Chumakov I', 'Jahner D', 'Grotkopp D', 'Hoffmann E']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cell,Cell,0413066,,IM,"['Animals', '*Genes, Lethal', 'Genes, Recessive', '*Genes, Viral', 'Heterozygote', 'Homozygote', 'Mice/*embryology', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/*genetics', 'Mutation']",1983/01/01 00:00,1983/01/01 00:01,['1983/01/01 00:00'],"['1983/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1983/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1983/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0092-8674(83)90511-1 [pii]', '10.1016/0092-8674(83)90511-1 [doi]']",ppublish,Cell. 1983 Jan;32(1):209-16. doi: 10.1016/0092-8674(83)90511-1.,,,,,,,,,,,,

Specific chromosomal abnormalities in the abnormal karyotypes were compared to morphologic subgroups of ANLL. An 8;21 translocation was found in 6 of 9 cases with M2 morphology but was also found in 1 case with M1 morphology. One of 4 with M3 (progranulocytic) morphology had a 15;17 translocation, and another had a 17q deletion. A structural abnormality in 11q was found in 3 of 7 patients with M5 (monoblastic) morphology, 2 of whom had a 9;11 translocation. The only case of M6 had a 22q-or Philadelphia chromosome in addition to other abnormalities. Statistical analysis of 27 abnormal karyotypes showed preferential structural rearrangement of 8q and 21q. We conclude that, in children as well as adults, specific structural abnormalities are correlated with certain morphologic subgroups of ANLL. However, other chromosomal changes associated with prior mutagenic exposure of adult ANLL were uncommon in children, which may suggest a difference in pathogenesis.","['Brodeur, G M', 'Williams, D L', 'Kalwinsky, D K', 'Williams, K J', 'Dahl, G V']","['Brodeur GM', 'Williams DL', 'Kalwinsky DK', 'Williams KJ', 'Dahl GV']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Genet Cytogenet,Cancer genetics and cytogenetics,7909240,,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Child', '*Chromosome Aberrations', 'Chromosome Deletion', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia/*genetics/mortality', 'Ploidies', 'Prognosis', 'Translocation, Genetic']",1983/02/01 00:00,1983/02/01 00:01,['1983/02/01 00:00'],"['1983/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1983/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1983/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0165-4608(83)90041-9 [pii]', '10.1016/0165-4608(83)90041-9 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Genet Cytogenet. 1983 Feb;8(2):93-105. doi: 10.1016/0165-4608(83)90041-9.,,,,,,,,,,,,

The severity of mononuclear infiltration in the liver correlated poorly with the size of the liver or spleen, the biochemical changes, or number of hairy cells in the blood. Abnormal serum biochemical values were present occasionally and were usually due to associated diseases or to complications of this disease. Elevated serum alkaline phosphatase activity was noted in four patients; three of them had granulomatous lesions in the liver. Unless the characteristic ""clear cell"" pattern is seen, the hepatic mononuclear cell infiltration may not be diagnostic of hairy cell leukemia and, in many instances, may not even be suggestive of neoplasia. A new technique for demonstrating tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase activity in methacrylate-embedded sections was developed, which allowed identification of hairy cells in the liver biopsy specimens of all five patients so studied.

High-performance liquid chromatography and competition studies with spermidine indicated that the homologs, which vary in the length of the carbon chain separating the amines, penetrated the cells. The structural specificity of the spermidine carrier was defined. Three of the six spermidine homologs supported cell growth during a 48-hour incubation in the presence of DFMO, indicating that a two-carbon extension of spermidine structure was tolerated for biological function. Two of the five putrescine homologs supported growth after being converted by the cells to their respective spermidine homologs. The central nitrogen of spermidine appears to be essential for function since diamines of chain length comparable to that of spermidine did not prevent DFMO cytostasis.

This inhibition of glycoprotein biosynthesis led to a cessation of cell growth which was reversible in a dose-dependent and time-dependent manner. After removal of the antibiotic from L1210 cell cultures resumption of sugar incorporation preceded that of thymidine incorporation and the recovery of cell growth. The treatment of cells with tunicamycin resulted in a significant increase in the intracellular pool of UDP-N-acetylglucosamine which occurred concurrently with alterations in cell ultrastructure including distentions of the endoplasmic reticulum and nuclear membranes. Similar ultrastructural changes and increases in the intracellular pools of UDP-sugars were observed in L1210 cells exposed to 5 mM D-glucosamine, which suggested that the antiproliferative effects of tunicamycin may be related to the accumulation in the endoplasmic reticulum of one or more nucleotide sugar precursors of asparagine-linked glycoprotein biosynthesis. However, the biological effects of tunicamycin could be distinguished from those caused by D-glucosamine. Exposure of L1210 cells to tunicamycin resulted in specific alterations in the biochemical composition of the plasma membrane and in the inhibition of cellular agglutination by wheat germ agglutinin which were not apparent following exposure to equitoxic concentrations of the aminosugar. These studies, together with those which demonstrated that recovery of the cellular capacity to synthesize glycoproteins was obligatory for the recovery of cellular proliferation in tunicamycin-treated cells, suggested that inhibition of the synthesis of glycoproteins was the major factor limiting L1210 leukemic cell proliferation.","['Morin, M J', 'Porter, C W', 'McKernan, P', 'Bernacki, R J']","['Morin MJ', 'Porter CW', 'McKernan P', 'Bernacki RJ']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Cell Physiol,Journal of cellular physiology,0050222,"['0 (Glycoproteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '11089-65-9 (Tunicamycin)', '28RYY2IV3F (Fucose)', '528-04-1 (Uridine Diphosphate N-Acetylglucosamine)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'N08U5BOQ1K (Glucosamine)', 'PHA4727WTP (Mannose)']",IM,"['Agglutination', 'Animals', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Membrane/analysis', 'DNA/biosynthesis', 'Endoplasmic Reticulum/*drug effects', 'Fucose/metabolism', 'Glucosamine/*pharmacology', 'Glycoproteins/*biosynthesis', 'Leukemia L1210', 'Mannose/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Neoplasm Proteins/biosynthesis', 'Nuclear Envelope/*drug effects', 'Tunicamycin/pharmacology', 'Uridine Diphosphate N-Acetylglucosamine/metabolism']",1983/02/01 00:00,1983/02/01 00:01,['1983/02/01 00:00'],"['1983/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1983/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1983/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/jcp.1041140204 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cell Physiol. 1983 Feb;114(2):162-72. doi: 10.1002/jcp.1041140204.,"['CA-09072/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-13038/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-24538/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,

In six of the nine episodes, the patients had received recent oral alkylating agents; conversely, recovery from aplasia occurred in some while on alternate alkylator therapy and two patients had no pretreatment. Spontaneous occurrence and recovery, therefore, could not be excluded. Onset of PRCA may be suggested by macrocytosis, but discontinuance of therapy at its development may not prevent PRCA if, indeed, therapy is one of the causes.

Samples from three patients had significantly abnormal ratios, one from a patient with SA and acquired Hb H disease (alpha/beta 0 X 26), one from a patient with secondary acquired SA (alpha/beta 0 X 88), and one from a patient who went on to develop acute myeloblastic leukaemia (alpha/beta 1 X 36). Globin synthesis was stimulated by 100 microM haem similarly in normal, SA and ID reticulocytes. Any limitation of globin synthesis in SA and ID is therefore not easily reversible by adding haem. Inhibition of haem synthesis in nonsideroblastic reticulocytes using 4 mM isonicotinic acid hydrazide for 1 h incubation affected neither total globin synthesis nor the alpha/beta ratio. These results contradict the view that decreased haem synthesis decreases globin chain synthesis and decreases the alpha/beta globin chain synthesis ratios in human reticulocytes. Previously reported findings that haem could reverse globin chain synthesis inhibition in SA were good evidence for a primary deficiency of haem synthesis in the erythroblasts of these patients.

For lung cancer, a linear interpolation between zero dose-zero effect and the data from radon-induced cancers in miners implies that the majority of all lung cancers among non-smokers are due to radon; since lung cancers in miners are mostly small-cell undifferentiated (SCU), a rather rare type in general, linearity over predicts the frequency of SCU lung cancers among non smokers by a factor of 10, and among non-smoking females age 25-44 by a factor of 24. Similarly, linearity predicts that the majority of all lung cancers early in this century were due to radon even after due consideration is given to cases missed by poor diagnostic efficiency (this matter is considered in some detail). For the 30-40 age range, linearity over predicts the total lung cancer rate at that time by a factor of 3-6; for SCU lung cancer, the over-prediction is by at least a factor of 10. Other causes of lung cancer are considered which further enhance the degree to which the linearity assumption over-estimates the effects of low level radiation. A similar analysis is applied to leukemia induced by natural radiation. It is concluded that the upper limit for this is not higher than estimates from the linearity hypothesis. The use of the selectivities is justified by the fact that the total incidence of lung cancer or leukemia is an upper limit on the rate at which it is caused by natural radiation effects; in determining upper limits it is justifiable to select situations which minimize them.","['Cohen, A F', 'Cohen, B L']","['Cohen AF', 'Cohen BL']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Health Phys,Health physics,2985093R,,IM,"['Adult', 'Background Radiation', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Radiation', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', '*Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced']",1980/01/01 00:00,1980/01/01 00:01,['1980/01/01 00:00'],"['1980/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1980/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1980/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/00004032-198001000-00006 [doi]'],ppublish,Health Phys. 1980 Jan;38(1):53-69. doi: 10.1097/00004032-198001000-00006.,,,,,,,,,,,"['University of Pittsburgh, PA 15260.']",

These and other results suggest that this newly isolated protein is the one responsible for the Ca2+-dependent binding of the drug to the basophil membrane.","['Mazurek, N', 'Bashkin, P', 'Pecht, I']","['Mazurek N', 'Bashkin P', 'Pecht I']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,EMBO J,The EMBO journal,8208664,"['0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (cromolyn binding protein, rat)', 'Q2WXR1I0PK (Cromolyn Sodium)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Basophils/*metabolism', 'Carrier Proteins/isolation & purification/*metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Membrane/metabolism', 'Chromatography, Affinity', 'Cromolyn Sodium/*metabolism', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*metabolism', 'Membrane Proteins', 'Molecular Weight', 'Rats']",1982/01/01 00:00,1982/01/01 00:01,['1982/01/01 00:00'],"['1982/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1982/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1982/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,EMBO J. 1982;1(5):585-90.,,,,PMC553091,,,,,,,,

Thymocytes had high ADA activity (21.2 +/- 6.8 10(3) nM/h/mg) and low PNP activity (1.2 +/- 0.6), whereas T peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) had low ADA activity (1.20 +/- 0.22) and high PNP activity (2.8 +/- 1.3). Moreover cortico-thymocytes had higher ADA and lower PNP levels than medullary thymocytes. A linear correlation was observed between ADA and PNP activities in both thymocytes and T-PBL. Cells from 13 patients with T acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and 10 patients with T lymphoblastic lymphoma (LL) had very high levels of ADA (respectively 13.0 +/- 5.4 and 22.8 +/- 14) and low levels of PNP (respectively 1.9 +/- 0.8 and 2.5 +/- 1.4). However no clear relationship appeared between subgroups of these T-cell malignancies defined by their patterns of surface antigens, revealed by reactivity with monoclonal antibodies, and ADA and PNP levels, and there was no correlation between the two enzymes. In contrast, cells from 31 patients with HLA-DR+ common ALL had significantly low values of ADA as compared to cells from six patients with HLA-DR- common ALL and a linear correlation was observed between ADA and PNP in cells from children with non-T, non-B ALL. These results show that specific stages of T-cell development may be characterized by the relationships and the correlation between the two enzymes and suggest that T-ALL and T-LL appear to be the group of lymphoid malignancies with a high degree of incoordination between ADA and PNP activities.","['Demeocq, F', 'Viallard, J L', 'Boumsell, L', 'Richard, Y', 'Chassagne, J', 'Plagne, R', 'Lemerle, J', 'Bernard, A']","['Demeocq F', 'Viallard JL', 'Boumsell L', 'Richard Y', 'Chassagne J', 'Plagne R', 'Lemerle J', 'Bernard A']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,"['0 (Antigens, Surface)', '0 (HLA-DR Antigens)', '0 (Histocompatibility Antigens Class II)', 'EC 2.4.2.- (Pentosyltransferases)', 'EC 2.4.2.1 (Purine-Nucleoside Phosphorylase)', 'EC 3.5.4.- (Nucleoside Deaminases)', 'EC 3.5.4.4 (Adenosine Deaminase)']",IM,"['Adenosine Deaminase/*metabolism', 'Antigens, Surface/analysis', 'HLA-DR Antigens', 'Histocompatibility Antigens Class II/analysis', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/classification/*enzymology', 'Nucleoside Deaminases/*metabolism', 'Pentosyltransferases/*metabolism', 'Purine-Nucleoside Phosphorylase/*metabolism', 'T-Lymphocytes/*enzymology', 'Thymus Gland/enzymology']",1982/01/01 00:00,1982/01/01 00:01,['1982/01/01 00:00'],"['1982/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1982/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1982/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1016/0145-2126(82)90027-3 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Res. 1982;6(2):211-20. doi: 10.1016/0145-2126(82)90027-3.,,,,,,,,,,,,

Biopsy proved them to be well-differentiated lymphosarcoma. On admission, systemic lymphadenopathy was noted and there was 26% of plasmacytoid cells in the bone marrow of the sternum. Monoclonal gammopathy of IgM,K type was found; her disease was diagnosed as a macroglobulinemia (IgM: 8,460 mg/dl). VENP-therapy consisted of vincristine 1 mg/w, cyclophosphamide 50 mg/d procarbazine 50 mg/d and prednisolone 30 mg/d was applied for about four weeks, but in vain. Transaminase levels were elevated (GOT 575 U, GPT 480 U) and the superficial lymphnodes did hardly diminish. Therefore, after improvement of the liver dysfunctions, 5 courses of AAAP-therapy, which was consisted of ACNU 50 mg/d (IV drip over 4 hrs), adriamycin 20 mg/d (IV push), methotrexate 25 mg/d (IV push) and prednisolone 60 mg/d (IV push) once a week or three were employed with excellent clinical effects. The superficial lymphnodes disappeared, M-protein and plasmacytoid cells in the bone marrow markedly decreased. An interval of the initial remission reached to 17 months. As previously reported, AAAP-therapy was also effective to multiple myeloma and acute lymphocytic leukemia of B-cell type. Therefore, AAAP-therapy would be one of the best chemotherapies for B-cell malignancy including macroglobulinemia.","['Maruo, K', 'Yoshikawa, H', 'Nagata, K']","['Maruo K', 'Yoshikawa H', 'Nagata K']",['jpn'],"['Case Reports', 'English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Japan,Gan To Kagaku Ryoho,Gan to kagaku ryoho.

As a result deteriorating hygienic circumstances may soon promote the occurrence of epidemics by pathogenic bacteria in a zone surrounding the bombed area. This may be promoted by the presence of persons with a suppressed defence capacity due to (low dose) irradiation obtained during the explosion or later on by fall out. Both infections by potentially pathogenic microbes--most of endogenous origin--as well as infections by a number of different pathogenic bacterial species could effectively be prevented by selective decontamination (SD). SD is a method of infection prophylaxis in use in neutropenic patients such as patients with acute leukaemia during remission induction therapy. SD is performed by oral treatment with colonization resistance saving antimicrobial drugs and should start within two or three days after a nuclear explosion. Suggestions are made for the organisation of large scale treatment of many thousands of persons with SD-pills while implications of the latter for the control of epidemic spread of infections among persons living in the first aid zone who have not been exposed to radiation during or after the explosion, are also mentioned.","['van der Waaij, D']",['van der Waaij D'],['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Scand J Infect Dis Suppl,Scandinavian journal of infectious diseases.

Splenic hemopoiesis is accompanied by white pulp atrophia. The cause of death was septicopyemia in three rats, anemia in three, and bleeding in one rat. None of the animals developed a leukemic blast phase. Myelodysplastic changes in this experiment are the same as have been shown to precede leukemia in rats treated with five DMBA pulses (Fohlmeister et al. 1981). Possible relations of myelodysplasia and leukemia are discussed.","['Fohlmeister, I', 'Schaefer, H E', 'Fischer, R']","['Fohlmeister I', 'Schaefer HE', 'Fischer R']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,J Cancer Res Clin Oncol,Journal of cancer research and clinical oncology,7902060,"['57-97-6 (9,10-Dimethyl-1,2-benzanthracene)']",IM,"['9,10-Dimethyl-1,2-benzanthracene', 'Animals', 'Blood Cell Count', 'Bone Marrow Examination', 'Erythrocyte Count', 'Granulocytes', 'Hematopoiesis', 'Humans', 'Injections', 'Male', 'Neoplasms, Experimental/pathology', 'Preleukemia/chemically induced/etiology/*pathology', 'Rats', 'Rats, Inbred Strains', 'Spleen/cytology']",1982/01/01 00:00,1982/01/01 00:01,['1982/01/01 00:00'],"['1982/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1982/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1982/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF00406245 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cancer Res Clin Oncol. 1982;104(3):249-61. doi: 10.1007/BF00406245.,,,,,,,,,,,,

Antisera to this suppressor factor raised in either DBA/2 or C57BL/6 mice can specifically absorb out suppressor factor and eliminate suppressor cells in the presence of complement. The in vivo effects of these antisera were tested for their ability to modulate the growth of P815 tumors in DBA/2 mice. It was found that the antiserum raised in syngeneic (DBA/2) but not allogeneic (C57BL/6) mice was able to significantly slow the rate of tumor growth and to prolong survival in treated mice. The antiserum was effective in this way only if it was administered early in the course of tumor growth. It was shown that this effect was not attributable to the presence in the serum of antibodies directed to antigens present on P815 cells, and it therefore appears to be due to interference with the function of T suppressor cells arising early in the immune response to the tumor cells.","['Maier, T', 'Levy, J G']","['Maier T', 'Levy JG']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Germany,Cancer Immunol Immunother,"Cancer immunology, immunotherapy : CII",8605732,['0 (Immune Sera)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Female', '*Immune Sera', '*Immunosuppression Therapy', '*Immunotherapy', 'Leukemia L1210/immunology/*therapy', 'Mast-Cell Sarcoma/immunology/*therapy', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Inbred DBA', 'Neoplasms, Experimental/immunology/therapy', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology']",1982/01/01 00:00,1982/01/01 00:01,['1982/01/01 00:00'],"['1982/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1982/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1982/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF00205314 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Immunol Immunother. 1982;13(2):134-9. doi: 10.1007/BF00205314.,,,,,,,,,,,,

Interferon (IFN) enhanced the NK activity of normal individuals and of 11 SLE patients, while it did not enhance in the remaining 12 patients. The patients whose NK activity was enhanced by beta-IFN had significantly higher initial activity than those who did not respond to beta-IFN. Furthermore, peripheral mononuclear cells (MNC) from IFN responders produced gamma-IFN after stimulation with concanavalin A (Con A) in titres comparable to those of normals. In contrast, peripheral MNC from beta-IFN non-responders failed to produce significant titres of gamma-IFN after stimulation with Con A. These results indicate that certain patients with SLE have low NK activity, which is generally paralleled by an inability to respond to exogenous beta-IFN and by blunted production of gamma-IFN after stimulation with Con A.","['Tsokos, G C', 'Rook, A H', 'Djeu, J Y', 'Balow, J E']","['Tsokos GC', 'Rook AH', 'Djeu JY', 'Balow JE']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Clin Exp Immunol,Clinical and experimental immunology,0057202,"['0 (Interferon Type I)', '11028-71-0 (Concanavalin A)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)']",IM,"['Cells, Cultured', 'Concanavalin A/pharmacology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Interferon Type I/*pharmacology', 'Interferon-gamma/biosynthesis', 'Killer Cells, Natural/drug effects/*immunology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/immunology', 'Leukocytes/drug effects', 'Lupus Erythematosus, Systemic/*immunology']",1982/11/01 00:00,1982/11/01 00:01,['1982/11/01 00:00'],"['1982/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1982/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1982/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Clin Exp Immunol. 1982 Nov;50(2):239-45.,,,,PMC1536692,,,,,,,,

The abnormal neutrophil population persisted after blast cells had disappeared from the blood and until marrow hypoplasia was induced by chemotherapy. When remission emerged, the peroxidase activity of the neutrophil population was normal. At subsequent relapse, the neutrophil population with increased peroxidase activity reappeared and with the induction of second remission neutrophil peroxidase again returned to normal. In 8 other cases where sufficient neutrophils were present for analysis by the Hemalog D, neutrophil peroxidase was normal or not increased in 7 cases, but was markedly reduced in 1 case of AML (M6 type).

During the active phase of their red cell aplasia, there was a marked reduction in the numbers of erythroid colony-forming units (CFU-E). Unfractionated sera or separated IgG fractions from these patients did not impair CFU-E proliferation from either autologous or allogeneic marrows. Increased numbers of T lymphocytes were present in marrow aspirates of these patients. Analysis of these T cells indicated that 90 and 35%, respectively, bore Fc receptors for IgG (T gamma cells). Removal of T cells by E-rosetting techniques augmented CFU-E growth in CLL-PRCA 10-fold. Similar treatment of normal marrows did not cause similar enhanced growth of CFU-E. Co-cultures of marrow T cells or T gamma cells obtained during the active phase of CLL-PRCA suppressed CFU-E growth from autologous or allogeneic marrows. After achieving drug-induced remission of the PRCA, marrow T cells were no longer inhibitory. In contrast, BFU-E (erythroid burst-forming units) or granulocyte proliferation in diffusion chambers were not suppressed by CLL-PRCA T cells.

The mechanisms responsible for this induction of differentiation, however, remain unclear. We have monitored the effects of two specific inhibitors of DNA synthesis to determine whether slowing of DNA polymerization can induce HL-60 differentiation. The results demonstrate that cytosine arabinoside (ara-C) induces nonspecific esterase activity in HL-60 cells and increases surface expression of the monocyte antigen MY-4. The results also demonstrate that aphidicolin, an inhibitor of DNA polymerase which is not incorporated in DNA, induces similar phenotypic changes. The induction of differentiation by both agents was accompanied by loss of clonogenic potential as monitored by colony formation in methylcellulose.

Among the viruses responding to chelators were mammalian type C viruses, primate type D viruses and bovine leukemia virus. The effect was dose-dependent. The avian type C virus AMV, however, was found to be not susceptible to the agents. Rauscher mouse leukemia virus treated in vitro with EDTA or EGTA showed reduced infectivity in mice. The results are considered as evidence for some association of divalent cations with membranes of mammalian retroviruses. The disintegrating activity of EGTA suggests that Ca2+ is an integral constituent of viruses but Mg2+ may also be involved. These cations seem to be responsible for maintaining integrity of retroviral membranes which, after chelation of ions, are either disrupted or become permeable for the exogenous template of reverse transcriptase. In addition, the disintegrating activity of trifluoperazine may indicate that a calmodulin-like protein occurs in retroviral membranes.","['Wunderlich, V', 'Sydow, G']","['Wunderlich V', 'Sydow G']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",Austria,Arch Virol,Archives of virology,7506870,"['0 (Ethylene Glycols)', '214IZI85K3 (Trifluoperazine)', '526U7A2651 (Egtazic Acid)', '9G34HU7RV0 (Edetic Acid)', '9Y8NXQ24VQ (Propranolol)', 'I38ZP9992A (Magnesium)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Avian Myeloblastosis Virus/drug effects', 'Calcium/*physiology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Edetic Acid/*pharmacology', 'Egtazic Acid/*pharmacology', 'Ethylene Glycols/*pharmacology', 'Magnesium/*physiology', 'Propranolol/pharmacology', 'Rauscher Virus/drug effects', 'Retroviridae/analysis/*drug effects', 'Trifluoperazine/pharmacology']",1982/01/01 00:00,1982/01/01 00:01,['1982/01/01 00:00'],"['1982/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1982/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1982/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF01314725 [doi]'],ppublish,Arch Virol. 1982;73(2):171-83. doi: 10.1007/BF01314725.,,,,,,,,,,,,

Stimuli often assumed to be noxious (e.g., electric shock, isolation housing) have been found to exert either potentiating or protective effects on an animal's response to potentially pathogenic stimulation. This variability has often been attributed to the influences of these stimuli on aspects of neuroendocrine or immunological function which are related to specific forms of pathogenic stimulation. The impact of a particular form of stimulation on the physiological state of the organism is also determined by the ability of the animal to cope with the stimulus environment. Factors shown to influence have included: (a) other aspects of the immediate environment at the time of stimulation; (b) prior experience with the same or other forms of stimulation; (c) the animal's ability to control its relationship to the stimuli by learning to escape or avoid them; (d) the availability of relevant feedback regarding stimulus onset (e.g., warning signal), and (e) the stage of the disease process at which stimulation is imposed. These findings by various investigators indicate that it may be inappropriate to place a priori value judgements on any form of psychosocial stimulation or stress either as conceptually or operationally defined. The adaptive value of the psychosocial environment will depend upon its perception by the animal, the animal's ability to cope with the stimulus environment, and the particular disease system being studied.","['Plaut, S M', 'Friedman, S B']","['Plaut SM', 'Friedman SB']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",Switzerland,Psychother Psychosom,Psychotherapy and psychosomatics,0024046,['0 (Blood Glucose)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Blood Glucose/analysis', 'Diabetes Mellitus, Experimental/psychology', 'Disease Susceptibility/*psychology', 'Electroshock', 'Enterovirus Infections/psychology', 'Female', 'Haplorhini', 'Leukemia/psychology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred Strains', 'Rats', '*Social Environment', 'Social Isolation', 'Stomach Ulcer/psychology', 'Stress, Physiological/*psychology']",1982/01/01 00:00,1982/01/01 00:01,['1982/01/01 00:00'],"['1982/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1982/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1982/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1159/000287635 [doi]'],ppublish,Psychother Psychosom. 1982;38(1):274-83. doi: 10.1159/000287635.,,,,,,,,,,,,15

Evaluation of these rare cases emphasizes that detection of surface immunoglobulins and spontaneous rosetting are not sufficient for the characterization of leukemic clones and raises some doubts concerning the use of available surface markers in the characterization of lymphoproliferative disorders.","['Semenzato, G', 'Pizzolo, G', 'Gerosa, F', 'Pandolfi, F', 'Pezzutto, A', 'Andrighetto, G C', 'Quinti, I', 'Agostini, C', 'Foa, R', 'Tridente, G']","['Semenzato G', 'Pizzolo G', 'Gerosa F', 'Pandolfi F', 'Pezzutto A', 'Andrighetto GC', 'Quinti I', 'Agostini C', 'Foa R', 'Tridente G']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,J Clin Immunol,Journal of clinical immunology,8102137,"['0 (Immunoglobulin M)', '0 (Immunoglobulin kappa-Chains)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell)', '0 (Receptors, Immunologic)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Animals', 'B-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Erythrocytes/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin M', 'Immunoglobulin kappa-Chains', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*immunology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell', 'Receptors, Immunologic', 'Rosette Formation', 'Sheep']",1982/10/01 00:00,1982/10/01 00:01,['1982/10/01 00:00'],"['1982/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1982/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1982/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF00915070 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Immunol. 1982 Oct;2(4):296-302. doi: 10.1007/BF00915070.,,,,,,,,,,,,

Lymphomas were induced in F1 hybrids derived from crossing these two stocks with various susceptible strains. In T-cell leukemias originating from F1 hybrids with Rb(4;15) as one parent and strain CBA or ASW as the other, the translocation chromosome was present in two copies. In trisomic tumors derived from Rb(4;15) X AKR F1 cross, the AKR-derived chromosome 15 was duplicated regularly. In contrast, all trisomic lymphomas of the T(7;15)9H F1 outcrosses showed duplication of the non-translocated chromosome 15 and not of the (7;15) translocation chromosome. It is suggested that the resistance of the T(7;15)9H stock to chemical induction of T-cell leukemia may be related to the position of the translocation on chromosome 15 (band D2). Our previous studies (reviewed by Klein, 1981) have indicated that this area may contain an oncogene that needs to be activated and subsequently undergo duplication in the course of leukemia development. In our previous studies on trisomic leukemias induced in heterozygotes (Wiener et al., 1979, 1980 b), we have found that duplication was non-random in all investigated crosses, unless the normal and the translocation marker carrying chromosomes were derived from the same inbred strain. A ""duplication preference"" scale could be established between chromosomes No. 15 derived from different strains. This suggested that the likelihood of leukemia development was different, depending on the genetic origin of chromosome 15. In the present study, we have found that the duplication of chromosome 15 occurred at random in the CBAT6T6 X C3H F1 cross. This is attributed to the close genetic relationship between the two strains, as indicated by their shared isoenzyme and other markers.","['Wiener, F', 'Spira, J', 'Babonits, M', 'Klein, G']","['Wiener F', 'Spira J', 'Babonits M', 'Klein G']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,"['57-97-6 (9,10-Dimethyl-1,2-benzanthracene)', '684-93-5 (Methylnitrosourea)']",IM,"['9,10-Dimethyl-1,2-benzanthracene', 'Animals', 'Chromosome Banding', 'Chromosomes/*physiology', 'Crosses, Genetic', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*genetics', 'Methylnitrosourea', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred Strains/*genetics', 'Species Specificity', '*Translocation, Genetic']",1982/10/15 00:00,1982/10/15 00:01,['1982/10/15 00:00'],"['1982/10/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1982/10/15 00:01 [medline]', '1982/10/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ijc.2910300415 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Cancer. 1982 Oct 15;30(4):479-87. doi: 10.1002/ijc.2910300415.,['5 RO1 CA 14054-09/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,

Although a similar activity was detected in the extract from mitomycin C treated cells, little activity was detected in the extract from cells treated with DMSO, a potent erythroid inducing agent. The induction of the active factor by UV irradiation was not specific of Friend cells since similar inducing activities were detected in the extract from non-erythroid murine cells irradiated by UV.

Regional differences in the incidence of neoplasms of these types have been reported. Furthermore, most published series have drawn cases from referral institutions rather than the general population. In order to determine the true incidence of a cohort we surveyed an entire population, that of Tasmania, an island state of Australia with a population of 410,000, during a defined period, the years 1977-1980 inclusive, for the occurrence of LPD. A total of 248 cases was discovered, made up of 133 cases of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL), 30 of chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL), 18 of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL), 54 of multiple myeloma (MM), eight of macroglobulinaemia (MGA) and five others. We identified B lymphocytes by the presence of surface membrane immunoglobulin (Smlg) and their ability to rosette with mouse red blood cells, and T lymphocytes by their ability to rosette with sheep red blood cells. Laboratory testing was performed in 201 (81%) of the cases and characterisation of the cell of origin as of B, T or ""null"" type was successful in 158 (64%). Of these 158, 136 (86%) were B, 4 (3%) T, and 18 (11%) ""null"". On B cell subtyping by heavy and light chain lg analysis the Tasmanian series, compared with other reports, had an apparent paucity of B-CLL, MM and MGA of lambda subtype (57 k to 12 lambda, k:lambda ratio 4.8:1) and an unusual incidence of B-CLL with the double lg heavy chain combination M+G.

To investigate whether this uniform and stable epigenetic state was the result of a selection in long-term culture for the corresponding cell type, 29 new cell lines were isolated from the hemopoietic organs of DBA/2 mice infected with Friend virus and were analyzed without delay for the expression of several erythroid traits. All the lines examined displayed levels of expression of the markers indistinguishable from those displayed by established Friend cell clones. Thus, newly isolated Friend cell lines appear to be blocked at essentially the same stage of erythroid differentiation as established clones. This indicates that the expression of several characteristic erythroid markers is remarkably stable in vitro and does not result from long-term selection.

Such a stimulation of phospholipid methylation was not observed in an HL-60 cell variant that is resistant to phorbol ester-induced differentiation. Enhanced methylation of phospholipids was detected 6 h after treatment and reached a maximum level of about twice the control level at 24-48 h. The degree of phospholipid methylation was dependent on the phorbol ester dose. The stimulation in phospholipid methylation by PMA was confirmed by measuring the activity of phosphatidylethanolamine methyltransferase in cellular lysates. After 24 or 48 h of exposure, the enzyme activity was elevated in the HL-60 cell lysates but not in the resistant cells. Phospholipid methylation was also stimulated after treatment of the HL-60 cells with the phorbol diester phorbol-12,13-dibutyrate or teleocidin, which is not a phorbol ester compound. These two chemicals and PMA are tumor promoters and inducers of cell differentiation in the HL-60 cells. Phorbol-12,13-diacetate and 4-O-methyl PMA, which are not tumor promoters or inducers of cell differentiation in the HL-60 cells, did not stimulate phospholipid methylation.

The case was unusual in its association with leukaemic arthropathy but ultrastructurally the hairy cells were typical. By immunofluorenscence and immuno-electron microscopy the neoplastic cells expressed IgA lambda both on the cell surface and intracellularly in the rough endoplasmic reticulum, perinuclear space and Golgi apparatus. No Ig was observed in the ribosomal-lamellae complexes. These cells also synthesised and secreted Ig of class A lambda in culture. However the serum paraprotein was of class IgA chi and could not be attributed to an abnormal population of plasma cells in the bone marrow. There was no other evidence for myeloma and the IgA chi paraproteinaemia appeared to be benign, apparently unrelated to the neoplastic proliferation of hairy cells.","['Newell, D G', 'Sattar, M', 'Hannam-Harris, A C', 'Cawley, M I', 'Jayaswal, U', 'Smith, J L']","['Newell DG', 'Sattar M', 'Hannam-Harris AC', 'Cawley MI', 'Jayaswal U', 'Smith JL']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Denmark,Scand J Haematol,Scandinavian journal of haematology,0404507,"['0 (Immunoglobulin alpha-Chains)', '0 (Immunoglobulin gamma-Chains)', '0 (Immunoglobulin kappa-Chains)', '0 (Immunoglobulin lambda-Chains)', '0 (Immunoglobulin mu-Chains)', '0 (Receptors, Fc)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/immunology/ultrastructure', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin alpha-Chains/biosynthesis', 'Immunoglobulin gamma-Chains/biosynthesis', 'Immunoglobulin kappa-Chains/biosynthesis', 'Immunoglobulin lambda-Chains/biosynthesis', 'Immunoglobulin mu-Chains/biosynthesis', 'Leukemia, Hairy Cell/*complications/immunology/ultrastructure', 'Male', 'Paraproteinemias/blood/*complications/immunology', 'Receptors, Fc']",1982/05/01 00:00,1982/05/01 00:01,['1982/05/01 00:00'],"['1982/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1982/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1982/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1600-0609.1982.tb00550.x [doi]'],ppublish,Scand J Haematol. 1982 May;28(5):441-50. doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0609.1982.tb00550.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,

There was no inhibition of TxB2 formation. By contrast, two structurally-related compounds, PGI2 and its stable analog, 6-beta-PGI1, did not affect the formation of either LT's or TxB2. The inhibition of LT formation by U-60,257 was rapidly reversed after removal of this compound from the cells. U-60,257 did not inhibit the cyclooxygenase of human polymorphonuclear leukocytes.

Lines resistant to 6-thioguanine (TGr) and 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine (BUr) were isolated from L5178Y and these three mutagen -sensitive mutants.

The hybrids homozygous for the mutagen-sensitive markers showed nearly the same sensitivity to UV, 4NQO, X-rays and MMS as their parental TGr and BUr lines. The hybrids constructed by fusing L5178Y BUr and TGr lines from each of MS-1, M10 and Q31 displayed the normal UV, X-ray and MMS resistancy of L5178Y cells.

The 4NQO-sensitive phenotype, however, behaved codominantly in somatic cell hybrids.","['Shiomi, T', 'Hieda-Shiomi, N', 'Sato, K']","['Shiomi T', 'Hieda-Shiomi N', 'Sato K']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Netherlands,Mutat Res,Mutation research,0400763,"['0 (Mutagens)', '56-57-5 (4-Nitroquinoline-1-oxide)', 'AT5C31J09G (Methyl Methanesulfonate)', 'FTK8U1GZNX (Thioguanine)', 'G34N38R2N1 (Bromodeoxyuridine)']",IM,"['4-Nitroquinoline-1-oxide/pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Bromodeoxyuridine/pharmacology', '*Drug Resistance', 'Hybrid Cells', 'Leukemia L5178/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*genetics', 'Methyl Methanesulfonate/pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Mutagens/*pharmacology', 'Phenotype', '*Radiation Tolerance', 'Thioguanine/pharmacology', 'Ultraviolet Rays', 'X-Rays']",1982/08/01 00:00,1982/08/01 00:01,['1982/08/01 00:00'],"['1982/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1982/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1982/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0027-5107(82)90267-6 [pii]', '10.1016/0027-5107(82)90267-6 [doi]']",ppublish,Mutat Res. 1982 Aug;95(2-3):313-25. doi: 10.1016/0027-5107(82)90267-6.,,,,,,,,,,,,

Genetic structure of leukemic and healthy children was found to be significantly different by phenotypic combinations of 2 loci (ABO and Rhesus). The distribution of children for their age at the beginning of the disease was studied. The results revealed that children with the low weight and body length values at birth, as well as those having ARh+ and BRh+ blood groups, develop leukemia earlier than those with ""average"" characteristics and blood groups other than ARh+ and BRh+. The anamnesis of children which developed leukemia demonstrated a higher infectious-inflammatory disease frequency, as compared with the control group. By comparison of some parental characteristics of two groups of children, it was found that parents of children which became ill, were on the average older at the moment of baby's birth than parents of healthy children.

L1210 cells treated with glutaraldehyde plus concanavalin A (ConA) were more potent in inducing antitumor immunity than those treated with Vibrio cholerae neuraminidase or mitomycin C (MMC). This and the finding that cell-bound ConA enhanced the immunogenic potency of MMC- or formaldehyde-treated L1210 vaccines indicate that ConA endowed the cells with additional potency in inducing antitumor immunity. ConA-free and ConA-bound vaccine cells took up the same amount of anti-L1210 antibody, suggesting that cell-bound ConA did not increase tumor-associated antigen molecules on the tumor cell surface. However, adoptively transferred spleen cells of mice sensitized with ConA-bound, but not ConA-free, vaccine amplified the vaccine-induced antitumor immunity in the recipients. These donor spleen cells suppressed the in vitro proliferation of live L1210 cells no more than non-primed spleen cells, nor was their amplifying activity abrogated by treatment with anti-Lyt-2.1 antibody and rabbit sera as a source of complement. This indicated that cytotoxic T cells and/or their precursors were not involved in the observed amplification. This as well as the finding that their amplifying activity was completely abrogated by treatment with rabbit anti-mouse brain-associated T cell antigen antisera and rabbit sera as a source of complement, led us to conclude that amplifier T cell production, associated with vaccine-bound ConA, was responsible for the enhanced immunogenic potency of ConA-bound vaccines.","['Kataoka, T', 'Oh-Hashi, F', 'Sakurai, Y']","['Kataoka T', 'Oh-Hashi F', 'Sakurai Y']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Japan,Gan,Gan,0151745,"['0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Mitomycins)', '0 (Vaccines)', '11028-71-0 (Concanavalin A)', '50SG953SK6 (Mitomycin)', 'EC 3.2.1.18 (Neuraminidase)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/analysis', 'Cell Division', 'Concanavalin A/*pharmacology', 'Immunity', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Leukemia L1210/*immunology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred Strains', 'Mitomycin', 'Mitomycins/pharmacology', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Neuraminidase/pharmacology', 'Spleen/immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Vaccines/*immunology']",1982/04/01 00:00,1982/04/01 00:01,['1982/04/01 00:00'],"['1982/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1982/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1982/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Gan. 1982 Apr;73(2):193-205.,,,,,,,,,,,,

This ability decreases with age and with duration of the contamination due to radionuclides. From the above aspects of radiation injury the ability of hemopoiesis to compensate the decreased production of differentiated peripheral cell forms is discussed. It is remarkable that myeloid leukemia occurred earlier and more frequently in 239Pu-contaminated animals than in controls. After the injection of plutonium-239, myeloid and lymphatic leukemias were diagnosed in most of the animals dying without osteosarcoma.

P mu-mRNAs (productive) correspond to the normal 2.7-kilobase (kb) membrane (mu m) and 2.4-kb secreted (mu s) mu mRNA species both in size and coding capacity and occur at approximately equal abundance in most mu-positive (pre-B-like) A-MuLV transformants. A mu-mRNAs (aberrant) generally fall into one of two categories--aberrantly small 2.3-kb mu m and 2.0-kb mu s mRNAs which encode aberrantly small mu polypeptide chains, or normal-sized, V H-containing mu RNAs which do not encode immunologically identifiable mu polypeptide chains. In one case, the latter type of A mu-mRNA was demonstrated to result from an in-phase termination codon in the D segment of the mu mRNA. Also, most, if not all, A-MuLV transformants express members of a 3.0 to 1.9-kb set of C mu-containing, but V H-negative S mu-RNAs (for sterile), the expression of which may occur simultaneously with but independently of P mu-mRNAs or A mu-mRNAs. The S mu-RNA sequences do not encode immunologically identifiable mu chains and can be produced by cells with unrearranged heavy-chain alleles, such as T-lymphocytes, although the structure of the S mu-RNAs from T-lymphoid cells appears to be different from that of B-lymphoid cell S mu-RNAs. Certain A-MuLV transformants also express gamma-RNA sequences that are probably analogous to the three different forms of mu RNA. These data support the concept that heavy-chain allelic exclusion, like that of light chains, is not mediated by control at the DNA or RNA levels but is probably a consequence of feedback control from cytoplasmic mu chains.","['Alt, F W', 'Rosenberg, N', 'Enea, V', 'Siden, E', 'Baltimore, D']","['Alt FW', 'Rosenberg N', 'Enea V', 'Siden E', 'Baltimore D']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,"['0 (DNA, Recombinant)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)', '0 (Immunoglobulin mu-Chains)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)']",IM,"['Abelson murine leukemia virus', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Line', '*Cell Transformation, Viral', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'DNA, Recombinant', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/*genetics', 'Immunoglobulin mu-Chains/*genetics', 'Lymphocytes/immunology/*metabolism', 'Lymphoma', 'Mice', 'RNA, Messenger/*analysis/genetics', 'Transcription, Genetic']",1982/04/01 00:00,1982/04/01 00:01,['1982/04/01 00:00'],"['1982/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1982/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1982/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/mcb.2.4.386-400.1982 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 1982 Apr;2(4):386-400. doi: 10.1128/mcb.2.4.386-400.1982.,"['CA-14051/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-24220/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-24530/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,PMC369803,,,,,,,,

Results indicated that inhibition of DNA polymerase alpha did not affect the accumulation of form III viral DNA in either permissive or nonpermissive cells. However, the normal accumulation of circular form I DNA in permissive cells was inhibited. The block in the accumulation of form I DNA resembled that occurring in some F-MuLV Fv-1-nonpermissive infections. Additionally, aphidicolin treatment resulted in the accumulation of novel low-molecular-weight viral DNA species, normally detectable in a nonpermissive infection of NIH cells with B-tropic F-MuLV.

Fifty mg MCNU/kg killed all CD2F1 mice within about 10 days, while the administration of 3,000 mg sugar alcohols/kg immediately prior to MCNU protected mice from the lethal toxicity and all survived. The amelioration of MCNU toxicity by sugar alcohols was dose-dependent. Pretreatment with mannitol 1 day before MCNU administration was effective. In addition, a series of five daily treatments with lower doses of mannitol was also effective. This protection was accompanied by the reduction of both body weight loss and myelosuppression. The antitumor effects of MCNU on P388 leukemia and Lewis lung carcinoma were not significantly altered by mannitol treatment.

Fab fragments of both hybridoma IgGs inhibited binding to neutrophils of soluble rabbit IgG complexes and sheep erythrocytes (E) coated with rabbit IgG. The number of sites for 3G8 Fab was 135,000 per neutrophil, roughly equivalent to the number of sites for rabbit IgG in immune complexes (112,000 per cell). We did not observe human IgG1 binding sites on neutrophils, although binding of IgG1 to FcR-bearing lines U937 and HL-60 was readily demonstrated. Other cell types bearing 3G8 binding sites were mature chronic myelogenous leukemia cells, eosinophils, 6% of E-rosetting lymphocytes, and 15% of Ig-bearing peripheral lymphocytes. No binding of 3G8 Fab was observed on the FcR-bearing cell lines U937, HL-60 Raji, Daudi, and K562 or on blood monocytes. However, 15% of monocytes cultured for 7 days and 60% of lung macrophages expressed 3G8 antigen. When analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate/polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, the neutrophil FcR immunoprecipitated with 3G8 or 4F7 Fab-Sepharose displayed a broad band extending from Mr 73,000 to 51,000; in many experiments this band was resolved into two poorly separated components, centered at Mr 66,000 and 53,000.

These 'immunoselected' sublines were compared with the original YAC line with regard to their ability to grow in a panel of semisyngeneic F1 hybrids. Natural hybrid resistance to YAC, previously found to be mediated by NK cells, affected the immunoselected sublines to a much smaller extent. This was further corroborated by the fact that the same sublines showed a decreased sensitivity to the in vitro lysis by NK cells from the same hybrid genotypes. Another set of YAC variants were produced by repeated in vitro exposure to NK cells and intermittent passage in highly NK-active F1 hosts. These 'NK-selected' sublines showed a permanently decreased sensitivity to NK lysis after 8-10 selections. When compared for in vivo growth with the parental YAC-1 tissue culture line in a spectrum of relatively resistant F1 hybrids, they had an increased frequency of takes.

Our interest in this study focuses on the relationship between the regulation of calcium concentration and differentiation. We used the fluorescent membrane probe DiOC6 to examine the relationship between MEL cell mitochondria and changes in cytoplasmic calcium levels occurring at the initiation of commitment. Fluorescence microscopy reveals the selective association of DiOC6 with MEL cell mitochondria, where an enhanced fluorescence is observed. Treatment of cells with dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) or other inducers causes a decrease in mitochondria-associated fluorescence levels that occurs with the initiation of commitment. A decrease in DiOC6 fluorescence is caused by agents that reduce mitochondrial membrane potential, but is only slightly affected by agents that alter plasma membrane potential. Amiloride and EGTA, agents that prevent commitment and inhibit calcium uptake, also prevent the decrease in DiOC6 uptake caused by DMSO. The effect of DMSO on MEL cell mitochondria is mimicked by FCCP, a proton ionophore that dissipates mitochondrial membrane potential. FCCP also caused MEL cell mitochondria to release calcium into the cytoplasm. When MEL cells are treated with DMSO plus FCCP, commitment is initiated without the lag period observed when cells are treated with DMSO alone. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that mitochondrial transmembrane potential is important in the regulation of cytoplasmic calcium levels at the time of commitment of MEL cells to terminal differentiation.","['Levenson, R', 'Macara, I G', 'Smith, R L', 'Cantley, L', 'Housman, D']","['Levenson R', 'Macara IG', 'Smith RL', 'Cantley L', 'Housman D']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cell,Cell,0413066,"['370-86-5 (Carbonyl Cyanide p-Trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone)', '526U7A2651 (Egtazic Acid)', '7DZO8EB0Z3 (Amiloride)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)', 'YOW8V9698H (Dimethyl Sulfoxide)']",IM,"['Amiloride/pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Calcium/*metabolism', 'Carbonyl Cyanide p-Trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone/pharmacology', '*Cell Differentiation', 'Cytoplasm/metabolism', 'Dimethyl Sulfoxide/pharmacology', 'Drug Synergism', 'Egtazic Acid/pharmacology', 'Intracellular Membranes/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Experimental/metabolism', '*Membrane Potentials', 'Mice', 'Mitochondria/*metabolism']",1982/04/01 00:00,1982/04/01 00:01,['1982/04/01 00:00'],"['1982/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1982/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1982/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0092-8674(82)90064-2 [pii]', '10.1016/0092-8674(82)90064-2 [doi]']",ppublish,Cell. 1982 Apr;28(4):855-63. doi: 10.1016/0092-8674(82)90064-2.,,,,,,,,,,,,

Patients with abnormal karyotypes who failed to develop hepatitis had the shortest survival times (median, 124 days). The group of patients who had the longest survival (median, 1130 days) included those over 40 years old, with posttransfusion hepatitis, and with normal karyotypes.

Twenty-six patients survived longer than two months after the operation. Despite the cyclosporin A, 31 patients (86%) suffered an acute form of graft-versus-host disease and 22 (61%) a chronic form. Nevertheless, the disease was usually treatable with immunosuppressive agents and caused the death of only one patient. Cyclosporin A caused renal toxicity in all cases; occasionally this was associated with a ""capillary leak"" syndrome, fatal in two patients. In children hypertension, fits, and fluid retention were common side effects. Blood concentrations of cyclosporin A correlated with blood urea values and blood pressure but did not predict the occurrence of graft-versus-host disease.

The average age was over 60 years. Patients wit chronic cold agglutinin disease had more hemolytic crises, bleeding and Raynaud's phenomena, and less frequently lymphadenopathy or hepatosplenomegaly. The frequency of anemia, positive Coombs test results, cryoglobulinemia and Bence Jones proteinuria was similar in the various groups. Survival time from diagnosis was on average two years in lymphoma, two and a half years in Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia, more than six years in chronic lymphocytic leukemia and more than five years in chronic cold agglutinin disease. Anti-I were common in chronic cold agglutinin disease (74 percent) and rare in other groups (32 to 33 percent). Anti-I and other cold agglutinins were rare in chronic cold agglutinin disease and common in lymphoma and Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia. In chronic cold agglutinin disease, and in Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia, cold agglutinins usually had K light chains--92 percent and 71 percent, respectively--whereas in lymphoma, 71 percent of cold agglutinins had lambda light chains. The type of light chains related to the specifically of cold agglutinins: 58 percent of IgM/K were anti-I, 75 percent of IgM/lambda had other specificities. Cold agglutinins were cytotoxic to autologous and allogeneic cells were killed implying that the former may be precoated in vivo with the antibodies. In conclusion, conditions with persistent cold agglutinins are a spectrum that varies from ""benign"" autoimmune-like chronic cold agglutinin disease to malignant lymphoma. Marked differences in the light chain type of cold agglutinins, specificity toward membranous antigens and severity of clinical manifestations were noted in benign and malignant varieties.","['Crisp, D', 'Pruzanski, W']","['Crisp D', 'Pruzanski W']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Am J Med,The American journal of medicine,0267200,['0 (Immunoglobulin M)'],IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Anemia, Hemolytic, Autoimmune/*immunology', 'B-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin M/analysis', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*immunology', 'Lymphoma/*immunology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', 'Waldenstrom Macroglobulinemia/*immunology']",1982/06/01 00:00,1982/06/01 00:01,['1982/06/01 00:00'],"['1982/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1982/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1982/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0002-9343(82)90852-X [pii]', '10.1016/0002-9343(82)90852-x [doi]']",ppublish,Am J Med. 1982 Jun;72(6):915-22. doi: 10.1016/0002-9343(82)90852-x.,,,,,,,,,,,,

The QSAR for the activity of the triazines on purified DHFR is compared with the QSAR for their action on L. casei cell culture and murine L5178Y cell culture. The QSAR for action on purified DHFR is similar to that on wild type cells; however, the QSAR for these cells differs remarkably from QSAR for both types of cells that are resistant to methotrexate (MTX). The conclusion from these analyses is that cells resistant to MTX protect themselves from this highly hydrophilic drug by developing a hydrophobic barrier. Our understanding of DHFR interaction with drugs is rapidly increasing via QSAR, and X-ray crystallography, combined with the new molecular graphics of Langridge's group, promises to expedite the process.

Lymphocytes from seven of the 11 patients studied secreted immunoglobulin in response to pokeweed mitogen (PWM). IgM was always the major immunoglobulin and in five of the seven responders it was the only class detected; only one type of light chain was observed in most cases. This was in contrast to normal lymphocytes which secreted all classes of immunoglobulin (IgM was invariably the lowest) containing both types of light chain. Lipopolysaccharide induced immunoglobulin secretion in only one of four CLL cases. This was again IgM with only one type of light chain. The assays are therefore most probably measuring a response by the leukaemic cells. In most CLL cases, immunoglobulin secretion by the residual normal cells, which proliferate in response to mitogen, was not observed. This inability of the normal lymphocytes to differentiate fully into immunoglobulin secreting cells and the block in switching from IgM production to other classes in the leukaemic cells may both be attributable to a defect in the regulatory system of the immune response in CLL patients.","['Johnstone, A P', 'Jensenius, J C', 'Millard, R E', 'Hudson, L']","['Johnstone AP', 'Jensenius JC', 'Millard RE', 'Hudson L']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Clin Exp Immunol,Clinical and experimental immunology,0057202,"['0 (Immunoglobulin Light Chains)', '0 (Immunoglobulin M)', '0 (Immunoglobulins)', '0 (Lipopolysaccharides)', '0 (Mitogens)', '0 (Pokeweed Mitogens)']",IM,"['Aged', 'B-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Light Chains/biosynthesis', 'Immunoglobulin M/biosynthesis', 'Immunoglobulins/*biosynthesis', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*immunology', 'Lipopolysaccharides/pharmacology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mitogens/*pharmacology', 'Pokeweed Mitogens/pharmacology']",1982/03/01 00:00,1982/03/01 00:01,['1982/03/01 00:00'],"['1982/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1982/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1982/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Clin Exp Immunol. 1982 Mar;47(3):697-705.,,,,PMC1536416,,,,,,,,

In the group fed by nasogastric tube the mean weight loss was significantly smaller (p less than 0.01) and there were fewer patients with a severe weight loss of more than 5% during the first 3 wk (p less than 0.01) than in the hospital diet group. Serum albumin reduction of more than 10% was present in 4/20 and 23/35 for each group respectively (p less than 0.01).

The most effective prophylaxis has included the use of protected environments and antibiotic regimens (PEPA). Most oral prophylactic regimens include vancomycin to provide coverage against aerobic, gram-positive cocci and some anaerobes. Regimens of nonabsorbable antibiotics are effective in eliminating the vast majority of bacteria from the stool, but the antifungal agents are less effective. However, once the antibiotic regimen is discontinued, organisms previously cultured will reappear. Several prospective, randomized studies have been conducted of patients with acute leukemia who are undergoing chemotherapy administered to induce remission. The frequency of complications caused by infection has been significantly lower for patients in the PEPA program than for controls. A recent study of patients with lymphoma has shown that patients in the PEPA program can tolerate higher doses of chemotherapy than can control patients and that they have lower frequency of complications caused by infection.","['Bodey, G P']",['Bodey GP'],['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Rev Infect Dis,Reviews of infectious diseases,7905878,"['0 (Anti-Bacterial Agents)', '6Q205EH1VU (Vancomycin)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Administration, Oral', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents/*administration & dosage', 'Bacterial Infections/prevention & control', 'Drug Therapy, Combination', 'Environment, Controlled', 'Feces/microbiology', 'Humans', '*Infection Control', 'Leukemia/complications', 'Mycoses/prevention & control', 'Neoplasms/*complications', 'Pharynx/microbiology', 'Prospective Studies', 'Random Allocation', 'Vancomycin/therapeutic use']",1981/11/01 00:00,1981/11/01 00:01,['1981/11/01 00:00'],"['1981/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1981/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1981/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Rev Infect Dis. 1981 Nov-Dec;3 suppl:S259-68.,,,,,,,,,,,,

A 10-fold increase in sensitivity was obtained with drug-resistant human leukemia cell lines. Repeated use of the coupled microspheres in the cytostatic assays did not increase their activity, indicating that these complexes can be recycled. The results suggest that coupled adriamycin sufficiently perturbs the plasma membrane to lead to cytostatic activity. It is proposed that this mode of drug delivery provides multiple and repetitious sites for drug-cell interactions.

In one experiment, blood cells from the mice in remission were transferred to normal BALB/c recipients, and the latter animals have not developed detectable tumor for the 6 mo of observation. Because 1-10 adoptively transferred BCL1 cells will cause tumor in normal BALB/c mice by 12 wk, the inability to transfer tumor to recipients might indicate that the donor animals were tumor free.

One consequence of this is that the cells can prove resistant to lysis by complement subsequently added to the system, a process termed here anti-complementary modulation. We studied quantitatively the extent of antibody loss accompanying the modulation by radioimmunolabeling the cell surfaces with 125I-Fab' gamma fragments from an anti-antibody. Antibody directed against the constant region of the IgG light chain (anti-lambda) gave modulation effective against syngeneic (guinea pig strain 2) complement that closely paralleled the disappearance of anti-lambda from the cell surfaces. Antibody directed against the idiotypic region of the light chain (anti-Id) was as effective as anti-lambda in modulating against syngeneic complement. However, the bulk of the anti-Id was seen by radioimmunolabeling to persist on the surfaces of the resistant cells, even after prolonged exposure at 37 degrees C, and was shown by immunofluorescence to be in a patched configuration. In contrast to the results with syngeneic complement, modulation effective against rabbit complement appeared to have an absolute requirement for clearing of the antibody: thus anti-lambda could modulate, anti-Id could not. The differences observed between anti-lambda and anti-Id could not be accounted for by differences in their isotypic (Ig subclass) composition nor by the numbers of antibody molecules bound. Studies with directly fluoresceinated and 125I-labeled anti-lambda revealed endocytosis rather than shedding was the major route of antibody loss from the cell surfaces over the period of anti-complementary modulation. The findings are discussed in relation to mechanisms that enable leukemic B lymphocytes to escape destruction when confronted by antibody and complement.","['Gordon, J', 'Anderson, V A', 'Stevenson, G T']","['Gordon J', 'Anderson VA', 'Stevenson GT']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Antibodies, Anti-Idiotypic)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Constant Regions)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Idiotypes)', '0 (Immunoglobulin lambda-Chains)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell)', '9007-36-7 (Complement System Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Anti-Idiotypic/analysis', 'B-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Complement System Proteins/*immunology/metabolism', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Endocytosis', 'Guinea Pigs', 'Immunoglobulin Constant Regions', 'Immunoglobulin Idiotypes/immunology', 'Immunoglobulin lambda-Chains/immunology', 'Immunologic Capping', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*immunology', 'Rabbits', 'Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell/*analysis']",1982/06/01 00:00,1982/06/01 00:01,['1982/06/01 00:00'],"['1982/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1982/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1982/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Immunol. 1982 Jun;128(6):2863-9.,,,,,,,,,,,,

The total cellular immunoreactive receptor is rapidly lost from erythrocytes during the process of reticulocyte maturation (from as many as 400,000 molecules to <20,000 molecules/reticulocyte). This event parallels the loss of cell surface transferrin binding sites and RNA content, and correlates with previous studies that have measured the decline in hemoglobin synthesis.Nonhemoglobin-producing normal human fibroblasts, which appear to have a much lower iron requirement than reticulocytes, contain similar numbers of immunoreactive receptors per cell (400,000 receptor molecules), when in an active state of proliferation. Although receptor density on fibroblasts is directly related to cell proliferation, our studies demonstrate that nonproliferating fibroblasts still retain significant numbers of immunoreactive receptors (150,000 molecules/cell) and transferrin binding sites. Since additional studies indicate that proliferating cells have increased iron uptake, a simple hypothesis would predict that the parallel increase in transferrin binding sites and total cellular immunoreactive receptor associated with proliferation is related to an increased cellular iron requirement. However, the number of immunoreactive receptor molecules and transferrin binding sites is not changed when cells are grown in iron-deficient media, or in media with added transferrin-iron. This result and the lack of marked differences in receptor number on both hemoglobin-producing and nonhemoglobin-producing cells indicate that other factors besides receptor density play major roles in the regulation of cellular iron uptake, retention, and loss.","['Frazier, J L', 'Caskey, J H', 'Yoffe, M', 'Seligman, P A']","['Frazier JL', 'Caskey JH', 'Yoffe M', 'Seligman PA']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Clin Invest,The Journal of clinical investigation,7802877,"['0 (Transferrin)', 'E1UOL152H7 (Iron)']",IM,"['Anemia, Sickle Cell/blood', 'Binding Sites', 'Cell Line', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Humans', 'Immunodiffusion', 'Immunosorbent Techniques', 'Iron/metabolism', 'Leukemia', 'Leukocytes/*metabolism', 'Reticulocytes/*metabolism', 'Skin', 'Transferrin/*metabolism']",1982/04/01 00:00,1982/04/01 00:01,['1982/04/01 00:00'],"['1982/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1982/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1982/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1172/jci110525 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Invest. 1982 Apr;69(4):853-65. doi: 10.1172/jci110525.,['AM27039/AM/NIADDK NIH HHS/United States'],,,PMC370140,,,,,,,,

Both lines produce a CSF species that stimulates exclusively the formation of neutrophil granulocyte colonies. This G-CSF copurifies with a mast cell growth factor but can be separated from M- and GM-CSF. NZB bone marrow is unresponsive to G-CSF stimulation. WEHI-3B D+ cells can induced to terminal granulocyte differentiation by a factor present in murine and human postendotoxin serum that is different from G-CSF present in WEHI-3B D+ or D- CM since the latter has little or no leukemia differentiation-inducing activity. Endotoxin treatment of C. parvum primed mice leads to simultaneous induction of serum activities with selective action on myeloid leukemic cells, a serum differentiation inducing activity and a leukemic colony inhibitory activity. These factors act synergistically to block leukemic stem cell self-renewal. The results suggest that a variety of inducible factors may have potent and selective antileukemic activity.","['Moore, M A']",['Moore MA'],['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Cell Physiol Suppl,Journal of cellular physiology.

An HL-60 cell variant, designated as R-59, which is resistant to differentiation induction by phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate was also resistant to differentiation induction by teleocidin. Differentiation was determined by increases in the percent of morphologically mature cells and in lysozyme and nonspecific esterase activities. Both compounds inhibited the growth of HL-60 cells by blocking them from entering the synthesis phase of the cell cycle with an accumulation of cells after 48 h in G1 phase. No such effects were observed in the R-59 cells. They were, however, as susceptible as the parent HL-60 cells, to inducers which are not considered to be tumor promoters such as dimethylsulfoxide and retinoic acid. However, these inducers cause the HL-60 and R-59 cells to differentiate into granulocyte-like cells. These results indicate that teleocidin produces in both the HL-60 and R-59 cells effects which are similar to those cause by phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate.

All infections were cured with the appropriate antibiotics and removal of the SRVC.

Iron deficiency anemia and the anemia of chronic disease are the most common types of anemia in the elderly. Nutritional anemias due to folate or vitamin B(12) deficiency are treatable and should not be overlooked. Newer chemotherapy regimens for acute nonlymphocytic leukemia have been effective in many older patients. Decisions to treat are sometimes difficult, often depending on the aggregate of coexistent physical and mental disorders. The most prevalent type of leukemia in the elderly is chronic lymphocytic leukemia. A benign asymptomatic course requires no therapy, but aggressive disease requires treatment. Multiple myeloma should be suspected in an elderly person who has both unexplained anemia and bone pain.

Rabbit antisera with activity directed against p28 (alpha-ATC) were prepared and p28 was identified by immunoprecipitation in NP-40 extracts of activated, extrinsically labeled lymphocytes. p28 was not expressed in appreciable amounts by unstimulated T cells, stimulated or unstimulated B cells, null cells, or adherent cells. Protein p28 was only minimally represented on resting thymocytes but was easily detected on 4-hr activated thymocytes and the T lymphoblastoid cell lines HSB2 and MOLT-4. Absorption and immunoprecipitation studies with alpha-ATC indicated that p28 was not present on erythrocytes, platelets, neutrophils, six B cell lines, six null cell lines, and seven other T lymphoblastoid cell lines. Protein p28 from HSB2 cells was absorbed by lentil lectin, concanavalin A, and wheat germ agglutinin affinity columns and was eluted with the appropriate sugars. Gel filtration column chromatography of unreduced p28 in the presence of 0.5% NP-40 or 0.1% deoxycholate gave elution characteristics consistent with a m.w. of approximately 60,000 to 100,000. In preparative isoelectric focusing (IEF) studies the isoelectric point (pI (p28) = 5.2 to 6.1) was similar or identical to that described for the reduced and denatured protein in two-dimensional polyacrylamide gels (pI = 5.5 to 6.2). Protein p28 was eluted from DEAE-cellulose (Whatman DE-52) ion exchange columns at 0.05 to 0.15 M NaCl. Experiments with monoclonal antibodies or heteroantisera specific for other T cell and B cell antigens and various lymphoblastoid cell lines and normal peripheral blood cells indicated that p28 is distinct from the human Ia-like antigens, from T3, T4, T5, T8, and from several other reported human T cell antigens that appear to correspond to Thy-1, the sheep erythrocyte receptor, and a human thymus-leukemia antigen.","['Udey, M C', 'Jendrisak, M D', 'Parker, C W']","['Udey MC', 'Jendrisak MD', 'Parker CW']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte)', '0 (Antigens, Ly)', '0 (Antigens, Surface)', '0 (Immune Sera)', '0 (Lectins)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Wheat Germ Agglutinins)']",IM,"['Absorption', 'Animals', 'Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte', 'Antigens, Ly', '*Antigens, Surface', 'Cell Line', 'Chemical Phenomena', 'Chemistry', 'Chromatography, Gel', 'Chromatography, Ion Exchange', 'Humans', 'Immune Sera', 'Infant', 'Isoelectric Focusing', 'Lectins/immunology', '*Lymphocyte Activation', 'Membrane Proteins/metabolism', 'Molecular Weight', 'Rabbits', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Wheat Germ Agglutinins']",1982/04/01 00:00,1982/04/01 00:01,['1982/04/01 00:00'],"['1982/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1982/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1982/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Immunol. 1982 Apr;128(4):1870-5.,"['GM 07200/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'P50 AI 15322/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,

However, one kappa gene is already rearranged, and after overnight incubation with lipopolysaccharide (LPS), most of the cells are induced to synthesize light chain. The induced cells display IgM on their surface, but do not secrete IgM. Thus, 70Z/3 cells resemble cells poised at the pre-B cell/B lymphocyte border. We have examined synthesis and post-translational modification of mu-chains in uninduced and induced 70Z/3 cells. Isolation of mu-chains and peptide maps demonstrated that both populations synthesize intracellular forms that correspond to membrane-specific mum and secretion-specific mus chains. These intracellular forms have completed only the first of the two glycosylation steps characteristic of eukaryotic cells. After induction by LPS, L chain synthesis commences, mum and mus synthesis are both increased twofold to threefold (due to an increased rate of synthesis rather than decreased degradation), and both complex with L chain to form mu2L2 tetramers. Furthermore, the glycosylation of a subset of the mum chains is completed, and these are placed on the membrane. However, unglycosylated mu2L2 tetramers can be placed on the membrane, so glycosylation is not a requirement. These data suggest that L chain may not be sufficient for externalization of mum and mus chains. These data support the idea that the controls of membrane placement and secretion of mu chains are post-translational and that different mechanisms operate for mum and mus chains.","['Mains, P E', 'Sibley, C H']","['Mains PE', 'Sibley CH']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Immunoglobulin Constant Regions)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Light Chains)', '0 (Immunoglobulin M)', '0 (Immunoglobulin mu-Chains)', '0 (Macromolecular Substances)']",IM,"['Animals', 'B-Lymphocytes/*immunology/pathology', 'Carbohydrate Metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/*metabolism/pathology', 'Chemical Phenomena', 'Chemistry', 'Immunoglobulin Constant Regions', 'Immunoglobulin Light Chains/biosynthesis', 'Immunoglobulin M/*biosynthesis', 'Immunoglobulin mu-Chains/biosynthesis/classification', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*immunology/metabolism', 'Macromolecular Substances', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Inbred DBA']",1982/04/01 00:00,1982/04/01 00:01,['1982/04/01 00:00'],"['1982/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1982/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1982/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Immunol. 1982 Apr;128(4):1664-70.,"['CA 29679/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA20314/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'RR07096/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,,,,,

Dexamethasone (10(-7) M) completely inhibited the formation of colonies in response to L929 CSF but had no effect on the response to CSF in the culture supernatants of the murine macrophage cell line, PU5-1.8. We postulated that a cofactor, interleukin 1, present in the PU5-1.8 supernatants was responsible for protecting colony formation against steroid suppression. Interleukin 1, isolated from culture supernatants of PU5-1.8 and from culture supernatants of human acute monocytic leukemia cells, blocked the inhabitory effects of dexamethasone on colony formation in response to L929 CSF. Moreover, dexamethasone inhibited colony formation in response to PU5-1.8 culture supernatants when interleukin 1 was absent. We also examined interleukin 2 for possible protective effects. Although crude interleukin 2 preparations (supernatants of spleen cells cultured with concanavalin A) blocked dexamethasone inhibition, purified interleukin 2 had no protective effects. These data indicate that interleukin 1 protects colony formation by a pathway that is independent of interleukin 2 and that supernatants of spleen cells activated with concanavalin A probably contain significant amount of interleukin 1.","['Mishell, R I', 'Lee, D A', 'Grabstein, K H', 'Lachman, L B']","['Mishell RI', 'Lee DA', 'Grabstein KH', 'Lachman LB']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Colony-Stimulating Factors)', '0 (Interleukin-1)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Proteins)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Bone Marrow/*drug effects', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', '*Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'Colony-Stimulating Factors/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Dexamethasone/*pharmacology', 'Female', 'Granulocytes/cytology', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-1', 'Interleukin-2/therapeutic use', 'Macrophages/cytology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C3H', 'Proteins/*therapeutic use']",1982/04/01 00:00,1982/04/01 00:01,['1982/04/01 00:00'],"['1982/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1982/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1982/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Immunol. 1982 Apr;128(4):1614-9.,"['AI 15482/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'AM 08054/AM/NIADDK NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 25056/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,,,,,

L5178Y, or L1210 tumors. Neoplastic cells were grown in vitro from tumor stock and injected i.p. into mice from two groups, one drinking tap water, and other drinking 30% heavy water in tap water. One-half of the animals in each of these two groups was given a single injection of MTX (4 mg/kg body weight) on 3 consecutive days per week. At death, extension of primary and metastatic tumors was examined and was found to be macro- and microscopically comparable in the corresponding groups. The mean survival time of untreated mice drinking tap water was about 2 weeks following injection of the fast-growing P815, L5178Y, or L1210 (V) tumors and approximately 5 weeks after injection of cells from a slower-growing L1210 subline. Body deuteration alone roughly doubled the survival time solely of mice bearing this L1210 subline. Treatment with MTX approximately doubled the mean survival time of hosts bearing one of the fast-growing tumors. Combined treatment with heavy water and MTX increased the mean survival time of the mice in all groups by 15 to 125% as compared to control values. The reasons for this effect are unknown. However, heavy water has been shown to exert antimitotic activity and to depress the incorporation of radioactive precursors into DNA of proliferating mammalian cells. The depression of antibody formation following antigenic stimulation and the reduction in numbers of nonneoplastic lymphoid cells of mice following moderate body deuteration may have contributed to the enhancement of MTX activity in addition to other effects of deuterium.","['Laissue, J A', 'Burki, H', 'Berchtold, W']","['Laissue JA', 'Burki H', 'Berchtold W']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['AR09D82C7G (Deuterium)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Deuterium/*therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Leukemia L1210/drug therapy', 'Leukemia L5178/drug therapy', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*drug therapy/pathology/radiotherapy', 'Mast-Cell Sarcoma/drug therapy', 'Methotrexate/*therapeutic use', 'Mice', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Probability', 'Sarcoma, Experimental/*drug therapy/pathology/radiotherapy', 'Time Factors']",1982/03/01 00:00,1982/03/01 00:01,['1982/03/01 00:00'],"['1982/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1982/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1982/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1982 Mar;42(3):1125-9.,,,,,,,,,,,,

Mortality from all causes combined was 66% greater than that of members of the general population of England and Wales. There were substantial excesses of deaths from non-neoplastic conditions, but these appeared to be associated with the disease itself rather than its treatment. A nearly fivefold excess of deaths from leukaemia and a 62% excess of deaths from cancers of sites that would have been in the radiation fields (""heavily irradiated sites"") were likely to have been a direct consequence of the radiation treatment itself. The excess death rate from leukaemia was greatest three to five years after treatment and was close to zero after 18 years. In contrast, the excess of cancers of heavily irradiated sites did not become apparent until nine or more years after irradiation and continued for a further 11 years. More than 20 years after irradiation the excess risk declined, but the fall was not statistically significant. The number of cancers of sites not considered to be in the radiation beams was 20% greater than expected. This excess, although not statistically significant, may also have been due to radiation scattered from beams directed at other parts of the body. The risk of a radiation-induced leukaemia or other cancer was related to the age of the patient at the time of treatment. Those irradiated when aged 55 years or more had an excess death rate from leukaemia more than 15 times that of those treated under 25 years of age, and a similar difference was apparent for cancers of heavily irradiated sites. The radiation dose to the bone marrow was estimated for the patients who died with leukaemia and for a 1 in 15 sample of the total study population. The excess risk of leukaemia varied erratically with radiation dose owing, perhaps, in part to the increase in the proportion of the cells in the bone marrow that are sterilised with increasing doses. A mathematical model using a linear leukaemia induction rate and exponential cell sterilisation fitted the data reasonably well, and the results suggested that for low radiation doses about two deaths from leukaemia would be induced per million people per rad of x rays per year for up to 20 years after exposure. Because of the failure to find a clear dose-response relationship this estimate must be regarded with caution, but it is in reasonable agreement with that derived from studies of the atomic bomb survivors.","['Smith, P G', 'Doll, R']","['Smith PG', 'Doll R']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br Med J (Clin Res Ed),British medical journal (Clinical research ed.),8302911,,IM,"['Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Colonic Neoplasms/mortality', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Radiation', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Radiation-Induced/*mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced/*mortality', 'Radiotherapy Dosage', 'Risk', 'Spondylitis, Ankylosing/*radiotherapy', 'Time Factors']",1982/02/13 00:00,1982/02/13 00:01,['1982/02/13 00:00'],"['1982/02/13 00:00 [pubmed]', '1982/02/13 00:01 [medline]', '1982/02/13 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1136/bmj.284.6314.449 [doi]'],ppublish,Br Med J (Clin Res Ed). 1982 Feb 13;284(6314):449-60. doi: 10.1136/bmj.284.6314.449.,,,,PMC1496076,,,,,,,,

The MOPP-radiotherapy treated patients have a significantly better survival and relapse-free survival than the monochemotherapy-radiotherapy treated patients (86.9 p. cent vs 76.1 p. cent and 83.5 p. cent vs 65.4 p. cent). Thirteen relapses were observed after a median complete remission period of 30 months: 6 patients are now free from disease and one is still under treatment. Ten patients died after a 55 months median survival: 7 died from Hodgkin's Disease and 3 from treatment toxicity. No secondary cancer or leukemia has been observed. The main long-term complications of therapy were sterility in male patients, after chemotherapy, and growth defects and disturbances of thyroid functions after radiotherapy.","['Cramer, P', 'Schaison, G', 'Andrieu, J M', 'Boiron, M', 'Bernard, J']","['Cramer P', 'Schaison G', 'Andrieu JM', 'Boiron M', 'Bernard J']",['fre'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",France,Bull Cancer,Bulletin du cancer,0072416,"['35S93Y190K (Procarbazine)', '50D9XSG0VR (Mechlorethamine)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', 'VB0R961HZT (Prednisone)', 'MOPP protocol']",IM,"['Adolescent', '*Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Hodgkin Disease/pathology/*therapy', 'Humans', 'Long-Term Care', 'Male', 'Mechlorethamine/therapeutic use', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Prednisone/therapeutic use', 'Procarbazine/therapeutic use', 'Prognosis', 'Radiotherapy Dosage', 'Vincristine/therapeutic use']",1981/01/01 00:00,1981/01/01 00:01,['1981/01/01 00:00'],"['1981/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1981/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1981/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Bull Cancer. 1981;68(5):456-64.,,Maladie de Hodgkin de l'enfant resultats a long terme du traitement.,,,,,,,,,,

We found specific transport alterations during this developmental program. Transport of 3-O-methylglucose increased with each successive developmental stage. Aminoisobutyrate transport was maintained during Friend cell differentiation, but fell slightly in erythrocytes. Leucine, lysine and uridine transport began to fall two days after dimethylsulfoxide exposure, and diminished further in red cells. These studies of transport are not directly comparable to uptake studies reported by others. Median cell volume and thus surface area decreased more during differentiation than amino acid transport declined, so flux, transport past a unit area of membrane, actually increased. Monosaccharide flux also increased. Only uridine transport fell in parallel to surface area.

To determine whether this assumption is correct, 42 patients with diffuse histiocytic lymphoma were induced with prednisone, high-dose methotrexate, Adriamycin, cyclophosphamide, and VP-16 (ProMACE). Nitrogen mustard-vincristine-procarbazine-prednisone (MOPP) consolidation was then used, followed by late intensification with ProMACE. Patients were selected randomly to receive adjuvant TPN or a standard diet during ProMACE-MOPP treatment. While TPN patients had a greater median weight gain than did control patients, lean body mass and degree of myelosuppression did not improved as a consequence of TPN. There was no significant difference in tumor response or survival between TPN and control patients, whether or not the patients were initially malnourished. In a second trial, 32 young patients with metastatic or other poor-prognosis sarcomas were randomly allocated to receive TP or a standard diet as an adjunct to one very intensive course of combination chemotherapy or chemotherapy plus total body irradiation; autologous marrow transplantation was used with gain than did controls but remained in a negative nitrogen balance. Response rates and median durable survival did not differ between the two groups. In both trials, the maximum nutritional support permitted by currently available technology was offered. Thus, the limiting factor may not be nutritional status but rather the intrinsic biology of the tumors and the limitations of their response to current therapy. In in vitro studies of the possible influence of nutrition on cancer treatment, we have compared sublines of P388 murine leukemia cells which are sensitive or resistant to Adriamycin. The difference in drug sensitivity correlated with differences in lipid composition, with more intracellular lipid, and with greater membrane rigidity in the resistant cells. Resistant cells have a relatively poor transport of drug into the cell; moreover, intracellular Adriamycin is sequestered in lipid depots away from DNA. These results suggest one possible relationship between nutritional phenomena and drug sensitivity.","['Levine, A S', 'Brennan, M F', 'Ramu, A', 'Fisher, R I', 'Pizzo, P A', 'Glaubiger, D L']","['Levine AS', 'Brennan MF', 'Ramu A', 'Fisher RI', 'Pizzo PA', 'Glaubiger DL']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial']",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*administration & dosage', 'Cell Membrane Permeability', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Doxorubicin/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance', 'Drug Therapy, Combination', 'Humans', 'Leukemia P388/metabolism', 'Lipid Metabolism', 'Mice', '*Nutritional Physiological Phenomena', '*Parenteral Nutrition', '*Parenteral Nutrition, Total', 'Prognosis', 'Sarcoma/drug therapy/mortality/*therapy']",1982/01/01 00:00,1982/01/01 00:01,['1982/01/01 00:00'],"['1982/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1982/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1982/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1982;42(2 Suppl):774s-781s.,,,,,,,,,,,,

Reported here are the clinical and pathologic findings of Aspergillus pericarditis in six immunocomprised patients who came to autopsy in the past 11 years. Five had leukemia, one had received a renal transplant. All had pulmonary aspergillosis. Two had clinically overt pericarditis leading to cardiac tamponade and death. Pulmonary aspergillosis preceded development of pericardial signs. Chest radiographs, serial electrocardiograms, and echocardiograms showed abnormality but were nonspecific. Pericardiocentesis was performed in one patient but proved nondiagnostic and yielded only transient hemodynamic improvement; postmortem Gram stain of the spun sediment of that pericardial fluid revealed branched hyphae. Although five patients received Amphotericin B, whether it entered the pericardial space is uncertain. Postmortem examination revealed extensive pericardial involvement by Aspergillus associated with effusions as large as 1000 ml Aspergillus penetrated the pericardium by rupture of myocardial abscesses and invasion from contiguous pulmonary foci into the pericardial space. A clinical diagnosis of Aspergillus pericarditis was never established, and at least two died of their pericardial disease. Aspergillus pericarditis is a lethal cardiac infection, which is likely to increase in frequency, and should be considered in the hemodynamically unstable immunocompromised patient, especially when signs of pericarditis or pulmonary aspergillosis are present.","['Walsh, T J', 'Bulkley, B H']","['Walsh TJ', 'Bulkley BH']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aspergillosis/immunology/*microbiology/pathology', 'Aspergillus flavus/isolation & purification', 'Cardiac Tamponade/etiology', 'Electrocardiography', 'Female', 'Heart/diagnostic imaging/microbiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/complications/immunology', 'Lung/diagnostic imaging/microbiology', 'Lung Diseases, Fungal/complications/*microbiology', 'Middle Aged', 'Myocardium/pathology', 'Pericarditis/immunology/*microbiology/pathology', 'Pericardium/microbiology/pathology', 'Pleural Effusion/etiology', 'Radiography']",1982/01/01 00:00,1982/01/01 00:01,['1982/01/01 00:00'],"['1982/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1982/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1982/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/1097-0142(19820101)49:1<48::aid-cncr2820490112>3.0.co;2-a [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 1982 Jan 1;49(1):48-54. doi: 10.1002/1097-0142(19820101)49:1<48::aid-cncr2820490112>3.0.co;2-a.,['P50-HL-17655/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,

Review of 57 cases.,999-1008,"Between 1966 and 1979, biclonal gammopathy was recognized in 57 patients. Clinical and laboratory features differentiated three groups: biclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance, 37 cases (65 percent); multiple myeloma, nine cases (16 percent); and lymphoproliferative disease--including lymphoma, macroglobulinemia, chronic lymphocytic leukemia and unclassified lymphoproliferative disorders--11 cases (19 percent). With biclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance, symptomatic multiple myeloma developed after two years in one patient; the others remained stable. One patient with multiple myeloma had osteosclerotic myeloma and a severe sensorimotor peripheral neuropathy, and another presented with plasma cell leukemia. In the remainder response to therapy and survival were much the same as in patients with multiple myeloma with a monoclonal protein. Patients with lymphoproliferative disease responded to chemotherapy like that for monoclonal gammopathy. Of the 57 patients, 30 (53 percent) had IgG and IgA components, 15 (26 percent) had IgG and IgM, six had two IgG components, three had IgA and IgM, one had IgA proteins, one had IgA and IgE and 1 had triclonal gammopathy. Of the 115 light chains, 70 percent were kappa; the chains were both kappa and lambda in 63 percent of biclonal pairs. In many cases, serum electrophoresis produced only a single band on the acetate strip, and the biclonal gammopathy was not recognized until immunoelectrophoresis was done. Although the clinical features of biclonal gammopathy and its response to therapy are similar to those of monoclonal gammopathy, this subject is of importance because of the lack of clinical data in the literature.","['Kyle, R A', 'Robinson, R A', 'Katzmann, J A']","['Kyle RA', 'Robinson RA', 'Katzmann JA']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Am J Med,The American journal of medicine,0267200,"['0 (Immunoglobulin A)', '0 (Immunoglobulin G)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Light Chains)', '0 (Immunoglobulin M)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Hypergammaglobulinemia/*diagnosis', 'Immunoglobulin A/analysis', 'Immunoglobulin G/analysis', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/analysis', 'Immunoglobulin Light Chains/analysis', 'Immunoglobulin M/analysis', 'Lymphoproliferative Disorders/*diagnosis', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multiple Myeloma/*diagnosis', 'Prognosis']",1981/12/01 00:00,1981/12/01 00:01,['1981/12/01 00:00'],"['1981/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1981/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1981/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0002-9343(81)90326-0 [pii]', '10.1016/0002-9343(81)90326-0 [doi]']",ppublish,Am J Med. 1981 Dec;71(6):999-1008. doi: 10.1016/0002-9343(81)90326-0.,"['CA-11911/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-16835/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'NS-14304/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,

Histocompatibility (HLA) typing was determined for A, B, and DR and MB antigens. Serum samples were tested for a variety of antinuclear antibodies (ANA), lymphocytotoxic antibodies and rheumatoid factors, and C2 levels were determined by hemolytic titration. Inheritance of C2D, the gene coding for C2, was limited to the haplotype HLA-A25, B18, DR2. Low but significant titers of ANA, rheumatoid arthritis nuclear antigen (RANA) and/or rheumatoid factors were found in eight of the nine adult family members without association with HLA haplotype. The sister of the proband had persistently strongly positive LE cell preparations for more than a decade and had joint pains while taking sulfa drugs. The son of the proband had leukemia. All other family members were healthy. We conclude that the increased incidence of rheumatic disease in persons with C2D deficiency is multifactorial and requires environmental factors or other hereditary factors unrelated to the HLA-A25, B18, DR2 haplotype. The C2D gene is clearly not associated with positive ANA tests or immunoprecipitins to RANA.","['McCarty, D J', 'Tan, E M', 'Zvaifler, N J', 'Koethe, S', 'Duquesnoy, R J']","['McCarty DJ', 'Tan EM', 'Zvaifler NJ', 'Koethe S', 'Duquesnoy RJ']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Am J Med,The American journal of medicine,0267200,"['0 (Antibodies, Antinuclear)', '0 (Complement C2)', '0 (HLA Antigens)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Antibodies, Antinuclear/analysis', 'Complement C2/*deficiency', 'Female', 'Genes, MHC Class II', 'HLA Antigens/genetics', 'Haploidy', 'Heterozygote', 'Histocompatibility Testing', 'Humans', 'Lupus Erythematosus, Systemic/*genetics/immunology', 'Male', 'Pedigree']",1981/12/01 00:00,1981/12/01 00:01,['1981/12/01 00:00'],"['1981/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1981/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1981/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0002-9343(81)90311-9 [pii]', '10.1016/0002-9343(81)90311-9 [doi]']",ppublish,Am J Med. 1981 Dec;71(6):945-8. doi: 10.1016/0002-9343(81)90311-9.,['AI-12507/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,

In the present work, eight different oncogene DNA sequences have been used as probes to search for homologous sequences in the DNA of organisms of other phyla. Five of these probes hybridized to the DNA of Drosophila melanogaster. Abelson leukemia virus probe detected a single homologous DNA fragment in Drosophila DNA. In contrast, probes prepared from the genomes of Harvey, avian, and feline sarcoma viruses and avian myelocytomatosis virus hybridized with multiple homologous sequences in Drosophila DNA. The identification of sequences homologous to vertebrate oncogenes in invertebrates demonstrates both a high degree of conservation of these genes and a wide distribution among divergent species.

This resistance appeared to be due to non-H-2 genes although a modulation of the tumour growth by genes encoded by the MHC was also evident. The study of backcrosses between susceptible BALB/c and resistant (BALB/C X B10.BR)F1 crosses revealed that 83% of animals developed lethal tumours after injection of 10(2) YC8 cells.

T cell proliferative responses against gp70 are associated with the production of a lymphokine inducing 20 alpha-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase in splenic lymphocytes.,2565-70,"One of the characteristic cellular immune responses associated with the regression of Moloney leukemia/sarcoma virus-induced tumors is a T cell proliferative response against the major viral envelope glycoprotein, gp70. The results described here demonstrated that associated with this proliferative response is the production of a lymphokine, Interleukin 3 (IL-3). The production of IL-3 was immunologically specific and showed the same specificity as that observed in blastogenic responses. IL-3 production was dependent upon an antigen-specific Thy-1.2+, Lyt-1+, 2- lymphocyte subpopulation but did not require the presence of an Ia+ or an adherent accessory cell. The results also suggested that IL-3 may constitute one of the blastogenic factors previously shown to be involved in the proliferative response to gp70. In particular, purified IL-3 was found to induce proliferation of both normal and immune nylon wool purified splenic lymphocytes. The phenotype of the responding lymphocyte subpopulation was Thy-1.2-, Lyt-1-, 2-, Ig-, and Ia-. Maximal IL-3 production occurred approximately 48 hr after the addition of antigen and its production was significantly blocked by mitomycin C. These characteristics were unlike those for the general production of blastogenic factor activity suggesting that IL-3 is responsible for only a minor component of the proliferative response.","['Ihle, J N', 'Lee, J C', 'Rebar, L']","['Ihle JN', 'Lee JC', 'Rebar L']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Antigens, Viral)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Interleukin-3)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)', '0 (Viral Proteins)', 'EC 1.1.1.- (20-Hydroxysteroid Dehydrogenases)']",IM,"['20-Hydroxysteroid Dehydrogenases/metabolism', 'Animals', 'Antigens, Viral/*immunology', 'Interleukin-2/biosynthesis', 'Interleukin-3', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*immunology', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Lymphokines/biosynthesis', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Nude', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/immunology', 'Phenotype', 'Spleen/immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Viral Envelope Proteins', 'Viral Proteins/*immunology']",1981/12/01 00:00,1981/12/01 00:01,['1981/12/01 00:00'],"['1981/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1981/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1981/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Immunol. 1981 Dec;127(6):2565-70.,['N01-CO-75380/CO/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,

The present studies demonstrate that secretion of CF is triggered by the binding of neoplastic targets to BCG-activated macrophages. The binding of tumor targets, but not of normal lymphocytes, resulted in enhanced secretion of CF from BCG-activated macrophages, although not from macrophages elicited by thioglycolate broth. Dead or metabolically inactive tumor targets, as well as membrane preparations of tumor targets, induced secretion of CF from BCG-activated macrophages. The blocking of macrophage-target binding with a porous filter prevented augmented secretion of CF. Appreciable secretion of CF occurred in as little as 30 min after addition of tumor targets to BCG macrophages. Binding did not induce a generalized increase in secretion of neutral proteases by BCG macrophages, since secretion of plasminogen activator was actually decreased after the binding of P815 targets.

To evaluate whether alloimmunization continues to be a long-term problem in patients surviving induction therapy, 114 patients with acute nonlymphocytic leukemia (ANLL) who survived more than 6 mo and who received multiple courses of chemotherapy and abundant platelet transfusions were studied. Clinical response to random donor platelets and lymphocytotoxic antibody (LCTAb) were measured pretreatment and serially throughout the study period. Fourteen patients (12%) were alloimmunized upon admission, 34 (30%) patients became alloimmunized during remission induction therapy, and 66 (58%) patients did not become alloimmunized during that period. Sixty-one of these 66 patients (92%) never became alloimmunized and responded to random donor platelets during their subsequent course despite the fact they received multiple further platelet transfusions, whereas the alloimmunized patients tended to remain alloimmunized for their entire clinical course. There was no difference in age or sex between groups, and prognostic factors predicting alloimmunization could not be detected. In greater than 90% of patients not alloimmunized at admission, the presence or absence of LCTAb after induction predicts later alloantibody production. This information can be used to plan the type of platelet transfusions (HLA-matched or random donor) needed for subsequent maintenance and induction therapy. It may also help to identify a group of patients to whom more aggressive maintenance chemotherapy may be more safely administered.","['Dutcher, J P', 'Schiffer, C A', 'Aisner, J', 'Wiernik, P H']","['Dutcher JP', 'Schiffer CA', 'Aisner J', 'Wiernik PH']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antilymphocyte Serum)', '0 (HLA Antigens)', '0 (Isoantibodies)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antilymphocyte Serum', 'Blood Transfusion', 'Female', 'HLA Antigens', 'Humans', '*Immunization', 'Isoantibodies/*biosynthesis', 'Leukemia/*therapy', 'Long-Term Care', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Platelet Transfusion']",1981/11/01 00:00,1981/11/01 00:01,['1981/11/01 00:00'],"['1981/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1981/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1981/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)84783-1 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1981 Nov;58(5):1007-11.,,,,,,,,,,,,

Thirty minutes after ionophore stimulation, 55% of the total 5-HETE synthesized was esterified into phospholipids and 35% incorporated into acylglycerols. In contrast, the other hydroxylated derivatives of arachidonic acid (HHT and leukotriene B) were not incorporated into acylglycerols or phospholipids.

At concentrations (7 X 10-4 M) which had no inhibitory effect on cell growth, pretreatment of these cells with procaine for 12-24 hr caused a pronounced inhibition ( greater than 90%) of commitment of terminal erythroid differentiation of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO)-treated cells. Simultaneous treatment of MEL cells with DMSO and procaine, however, resulted to only slight inhibition (less than 20%) of commitment. Blockade of commitment by procaine pretreatment appears to be general since it was observed in cells treated with other inducers (6-thioguanine, dimethylformamide). Procaine pretreatment did not abolish the ability of MEL cells to complete the ""latent period"" and commit upon the removal of the block. Reversal of procaine inhibition of commitment was obtained by the addition of either CaCl2 (1.0 mM), calcium ionophore A23817 (1 microgram/ml), but not of MgCl2 (1.0 mM). From these data we conclude that procaine inhibits the terminal erythroid differentiation of MEL cells by blocking an event or process required for commitment which occurs prior to commitment itself.

Using a human lymphoblastoid cell line (WI-L2) deficient in adenine phosphoribosyltransferase (EC 2.4.2.7), we have quantitated the rate of adenine synthesis and the relative importance of the phosphorolysis of 5'-methylthioadenosine versus adenosine or 2'-deoxyadenosine in adenine generation. Dividing adenine phosphoribosyltransferase-deficient WI-L2 cells produced adenine at a rate of 0.27 nmol/mg protein/h. This represented approximately 10% of the rate of hypoxanthine production by WI-L2 cells deficient in hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase (EC 2.4.2.8) but was equivalent to the rate of 5'-methylthioadenosine synthesis by human lymphoblastoid CCRF-CEM deficient in 5'-methylthioadenosine, phosphorylase (5'-methylthioadenosine: orthophosphate methylthioribosyltransferase). Up to 97% of adenine, but not hypoxanthine, synthesis was inhibited dose-dependently by the S-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase-inhibitor methylglyoxal bis(guanylhydrazone) and also by spermidine and spermine, but was enhanced by putrescine. The addition of 2-fluoroadenine, a potent competitive inhibitor of methylthioadenosine phosphorylase (Ki = 0.43 microM) to adenine phosphoribosyl-transferase-deficient cells resulted in a progressive accumulation of 5'-methylthioadenosine in the culture medium, and up to an 85% decrease in adenine production at non-toxic concentrations. These results show that de novo adenine synthesis by dividing human cells is considerable, and that 85-97% derives from the cleavage of 5'-methylthioadenosine and hence from polyamine synthesis.","['Kamatani, N', 'Carson, D A']","['Kamatani N', 'Carson DA']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Netherlands,Biochim Biophys Acta,Biochimica et biophysica acta,0217513,"['0 (Polyamines)', '0 (Thionucleosides)', '2FZ7Y3VOQX (Spermine)', 'EC 2.4.2.1 (Purine-Nucleoside Phosphorylase)', ""EC 2.4.2.28 (5'-methylthioadenosine phosphorylase)"", 'EC 2.4.2.7 (Adenine Phosphoribosyltransferase)', 'EC 2.4.2.8 (Hypoxanthine Phosphoribosyltransferase)', 'EC 4.1.1.50 (Adenosylmethionine Decarboxylase)', 'JAC85A2161 (Adenine)', 'K72T3FS567 (Adenosine)', 'U87FK77H25 (Spermidine)', 'V10TVZ52E4 (Putrescine)']",IM,"['Adenine/*biosynthesis', 'Adenine Phosphoribosyltransferase/deficiency', 'Adenosine/analogs & derivatives/deficiency', 'Adenosylmethionine Decarboxylase/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Genetic Variation', 'Humans', 'Hypoxanthine Phosphoribosyltransferase/deficiency', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/metabolism', 'Polyamines/*biosynthesis', 'Purine-Nucleoside Phosphorylase/deficiency', 'Putrescine/biosynthesis', 'Spermidine/biosynthesis', 'Spermine/biosynthesis', 'Spleen/metabolism', 'Thionucleosides/deficiency']",1981/07/17 00:00,1981/07/17 00:01,['1981/07/17 00:00'],"['1981/07/17 00:00 [pubmed]', '1981/07/17 00:01 [medline]', '1981/07/17 00:00 [entrez]']","['0304-4165(81)90024-6 [pii]', '10.1016/0304-4165(81)90024-6 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochim Biophys Acta. 1981 Jul 17;675(3-4):344-50. doi: 10.1016/0304-4165(81)90024-6.,['GM 23200/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,

The in vitro biological potencies of teleocidin and lyngbyatoxin A were almost as great as those of dihydroteleocidin B and TPA, but that of debromoaplysiatoxin was much weaker.","['Fujiki, H', 'Mori, M', 'Nakayasu, M', 'Terada, M', 'Sugimura, T', 'Moore, R E']","['Fujiki H', 'Mori M', 'Nakayasu M', 'Terada M', 'Sugimura T', 'Moore RE']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (Alkaloids)', '0 (Carcinogens)', '0 (Dermotoxins)', '0 (Irritants)', '0 (Lyngbya Toxins)', '0 (Marine Toxins)', '27974YJ83L (teleocidins)', '57-97-6 (9,10-Dimethyl-1,2-benzanthracene)', '96A4OVM68C (dihydroteleocidin B)', 'EC 4.1.1.17 (Ornithine Decarboxylase)', 'SE69L721CS (lyngbyatoxin A)']",IM,"['9,10-Dimethyl-1,2-benzanthracene', '*Alkaloids', 'Animals', '*Carcinogens', '*Cocarcinogenesis', 'Dermotoxins', 'Enzyme Induction/drug effects', 'Female', 'Irritants', '*Lyngbya Toxins', 'Marine Toxins', 'Mice', 'Neoplasms, Experimental/chemically induced', 'Ornithine Decarboxylase/biosynthesis', 'Skin Neoplasms/chemically induced', 'Structure-Activity Relationship']",1981/06/01 00:00,1981/06/01 00:01,['1981/06/01 00:00'],"['1981/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1981/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1981/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1073/pnas.78.6.3872 [doi]'],ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1981 Jun;78(6):3872-6. doi: 10.1073/pnas.78.6.3872.,['CA12632-06/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,PMC319675,,,,,,,,

In B cells, a complete gene for the immunoglobulin VH region is formed by somatic recombination of VH and joining region heavy chain (JH) gene segments [through an intermediate diversity(D) region gene segment]. In an attempt to determine whether a complete immunoglobulin VH region is expressed on T cells that bear an antigen receptor, we analyzed the restriction map of the JH-C mu locus in genomic DNA from two cloned murine cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) lines specific for the x-ray-induced leukemia RL male 1. We found no rearrangement of the JH C mu locus in the CTL lines, indicating that the T-cell antigen receptor(s) in these CTLs is not coded for by a complete immunoglobulin VH gene formed by joining of VH, (DH), and JH genes. In addition, we determined that C mu genes on both chromosomes were present and that there was no rearrangement of the C alpha, C kappa, or lambda chain genes in these CTL cells.","['Cayre, Y', 'Palladino, M A', 'Marcu, K B', 'Stavnezer, J']","['Cayre Y', 'Palladino MA', 'Marcu KB', 'Stavnezer J']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)', '0 (Immunoglobulin mu-Chains)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/*genetics', 'Immunoglobulin mu-Chains/*genetics', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred Strains', 'Nucleic Acid Hybridization', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/*genetics', 'Recombination, Genetic', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology']",1981/06/01 00:00,1981/06/01 00:01,['1981/06/01 00:00'],"['1981/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1981/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1981/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1073/pnas.78.6.3814 [doi]'],ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1981 Jun;78(6):3814-8. doi: 10.1073/pnas.78.6.3814.,"['AI GM 14617/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 09149/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'GM 26939/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']",,,PMC319663,,,,,,,,
