The tax gene product (HTLV-I p40tax and HTLV-II p37tax) is the transcriptional activator of the viral long terminal repeat. The rex gene encodes two protein products, p27rex/p21rex and p26rex/p24rex in HTLV-I and HTLV-II, respectively. Rex acts posttranscriptionally to facilitate accumulation of full-length gag/pol and singly spliced env mRNA in the cytoplasm of HTLV-infected cells. Previous studies showed that the first ATG of the rex gene is critical for Rex production and function. The importance of the internal ATGs to Rex function is not known. However, in vitro mutagenesis of the HTLV-I rex gene has provided indirect evidence which suggests that p21rex, and by analogy HTLV-II p24rex, results from initiation at an internal AUG of the tax/rex mRNA. By using an infectious molecular clone of HTLV-II, we investigated the importance of the internal ATGs of the rex gene on Rex protein production and function. Our results indicate that p24rex of HTLV-II is not initiated at an internal AUG and that the internal methionine codons are not crucial to the function of the rex gene and, ultimately, the transforming properties of the virus.","['Green, P L', 'Xie, Y M', 'Chen, I S']","['Green PL', 'Xie YM', 'Chen IS']","['Department of Medicine, UCLA School of Medicine 90024-1736.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Codon)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', 'AE28F7PNPL (Methionine)']",IM,"['Cell Line', '*Cell Transformation, Viral', 'Codon/*genetics', '*Genes, Viral', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 2/*genetics/physiology', 'Humans', '*Methionine', 'Plasmids', 'RNA, Messenger/*genetics', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Trans-Activators/*genetics', 'Transfection', '*Virus Replication']",1990/10/01 00:00,1990/10/01 00:01,['1990/10/01 00:00'],"['1990/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Virol. 1990 Oct;64(10):4914-21. doi: 10.1128/JVI.64.10.4914-4921.1990.,"['CA 32737/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 38597/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",['10.1128/JVI.64.10.4914-4921.1990 [doi]'],,PMC247982,,,,,,

A serum monoclonal gammapathy was found in 4 patients, Ig M/k in two cases and IgM/l and IgG/k in one case. Patients with hypogammaglobulinaemia had a similar surface phenotype as patients with normal Ig levels (MRFC+, sIg+, CD20+, HLA/DR+, FMC7-, CD5+, CD9+). On the other hand the cases with hypogammaglobulinaemia displayed the features of a more advanced disease, a higher incidence of organomegalies (p less than 0.05), anaemia and/or thrombopenia (p less than 0.05), a diffuse bone marrow pattern (p less than 0.05), advanced clinical stages (p less than 0.05) as well as higher levels of both peripherial blood (p less than 0.02) and bone marrow lymphocytosis (p less than 0.02).

Media containing only horse sera (as opposed to horse and fetal calf sera) and catalase (for antioxidative effect) supported improved culture viability, as indicated by increased recovery of progenitor cells (granulocyte-macrophage colony-forming units, CFU-GM) and the release of abundant erythroid cells in the cultures for up to 3 weeks. CFU-GM were maintained for at least 3-4 weeks of culture. Culture appearance, cell counts, and assays of CFU-GM were used to compare the culture kinetics of tumor-involved marrow to normal marrow specimens. Cultures of marrow with extensive tumor involvement tended to be less viable, apparently due to a relative lack of competent progenitors. To investigate whether canine long-term marrow culture provided a purging effect similar to the loss of tumor cells noted in human long-term cultures of marrow from patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) or acute myelogenous leukemia (AML), we established long-term marrow cultures from 28 dogs with histologically confirmed untreated lymphoma or leukemia. Eleven of these dogs had cytogenetically marked tumor cells in the marrow at the initiation of culture. In six dogs with lymphoma and one dog with acute monocytic leukemia (AMoL) French-American-British classification (FAB) M4 leukemia, we could detect no cytogenetic evidence for persistence of the tumor clones in individually plucked or pooled CFU-GM grown from 3-week-old long-term cultures. In one case of AML (FAB M2), 80% of CFU-GM recovered from long-term cultures at 4 weeks still contained an extra metacentric marker chromosome associated with the continued presence of the leukemic clone in the cultures. Our documentation of a purging effect for some tumors supports the use of this canine model system in the investigation of autologous marrow transplantation with long-term cultured cells for humans with lymphoma and leukemia.","['Carter, R F', 'Kruth, S A', 'Valli, V E', 'Dube, I D']","['Carter RF', 'Kruth SA', 'Valli VE', 'Dube ID']","['Department of Pathology, University of Toronto, Ontario, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,['0 (Genetic Markers)'],IM,"['Animals', '*Bone Marrow Cells', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Dogs', '*Genetic Markers', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology', 'Leukemia/genetics/*pathology', 'Lymphoma/genetics/*pathology']",1990/10/01 00:00,1990/10/01 00:01,['1990/10/01 00:00'],"['1990/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Exp Hematol. 1990 Oct;18(9):995-1001.,,,,,,,,,,

In this study we attempted the purging of the malignant cells by the use of VP-16-213 (VP-16) and nitrogen mustard (NM) either alone or in combination. Four cell lines from various hematological malignancies were utilized: SK-DHL-2 was established from a B-cell diffuse histiocytic lymphoma; RAJI was from an Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-infected B-cell lymphoma cell line; K-562 were from a chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) blastic crisis; and HL-60, derived from a human promyelocytic leukemia, were used in exponential growth phase. Four logs of tumor cell-elimination were observed after 1-h incubation of RAJI cells with 25 micrograms/ml of VP-16. K-562 and SK-DHL-2 cells showed a greater than 4 logs reduction after 1-h exposure to 75 micrograms/ml of VP-16, and HL-60 cell line growth was inhibited by 3.2 logs. Under the same conditions (i.e., the treatment with 75 micrograms/ml), we observed a mean recovery of 2.7% of BM granulocyte-macrophage colonies (granulocyte-macrophage colony-forming units, CFU-GM), 3.2% of erythroid (erythroid burst-forming units, BFU-E), and 2.5% of pluripotent (granulocyte erythrocyte macrophage megakaryocyte colony-forming units, CFU-GEMM) progenitors, respectively. More than 3 logs reduction of leukemia and lymphoma cell lines were reached following 1-h treatment with 1 micrograms/ml of NM. After exposure to the same concentration of the drug we obtained 2.5% CFU-GM, 1.2% BFU-E, and 2% CFU-GEMM recovery. A drug mixture containing constant doses of VP-16 (10 and 20 micrograms/ml) and NM (1 micrograms/ml) reduced HL-60 and SK-DHL-2 cell growth to undetectable levels (i.e., 4 and 5 logs elimination) in the presence of an excess of irradiated BM cells, whereas it did not further affect the recovery of the BM precursors as compared to the single drugs used alone. These results suggest that the combination of these two drugs at the selected dose level could provide a better therapeutic index (i.e., higher tumor cell killing coupled with no additional cytotoxic effect on normal BM cells) than the same chemotherapeutic agent used alone and that this mixture may be useful for the ""ex vivo"" treatment of BM grafts.","['Lemoli, R M', 'Gulati, S C']","['Lemoli RM', 'Gulati SC']","['Department of Medicine Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York 10021.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,"['0 (Nitrogen Mustard Compounds)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)']",IM,"['Bone Marrow/*drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Synergism', 'Etoposide/*pharmacology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*pathology', 'Lymphoma/*pathology', 'Nitrogen Mustard Compounds/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects']",1990/10/01 00:00,1990/10/01 00:01,['1990/10/01 00:00'],"['1990/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Exp Hematol. 1990 Oct;18(9):1008-12.,,,,,,,,,,

Probes that can detect restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLPs) on chromosome 12, which makes it possible to determine the copy number of this chromosome, as well as bcl-1 probes that can detect t(11;14) were used. Of 13 CLL cases with normal karyotypes, none showed evidence for either trisomy 12 or t(11;14). This finding indicates that CLL cases with an apparently normal karyotype do not have two of the most common clonal chromosomal aberrations and may be karyotypically normal.

Ca, Mg-dependent endonucleolysis activity was the same in the group of patients with non-malignant pathology and in donors' one. Successful treatment and remission state of our patients was associated with alteration of the Ca, Mg-dependent endonucleolysis activity to normal level as well as immunological parameters.

The cis and trans diastereoisomers were characterized by NMR. The absolute configurations of the enantiomers were established by X-ray diffraction and circular dichroism (CD) measurements. By means of absorption spectroscopy and determinations of fluorescence and fluorescence decay, it was found that the cancerostatically active compound (+)(6aR, 13aS)-3,4-dimethoxy-10,11-dimethyl-6,6a,7,8,13, 13a-hexahydrochromeno[4,3-b][1,5]benzodiazepine (ZIMET 54/79) and its biologically inactive (-) enantiomer (ZIMET 55/79) interact with liposomal membranes. At pH values of 6.0 and 7.3 the long-wave absorption bands of these agents showed weak bathochromic and hypochromic effects upon addition of neutral, and positively and negatively charged phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylcholine/cholesterol liposomes. Such spectral changes are interpreted as resulting from the binding of both agents to phospholipid bilayers. Steady-state determinations using the membrane probe 1-anilino-8-naphthalenesulfonic acid (1,8-ANS) led to the observation of a small decrease in fluorescence intensity in the presence of either agent. Time-resolved measurements demonstrate that the mechanism of action of the agents occurs mainly through the partial displacement of probe molecules from regions of hydrophobic binding to areas of greater solvent accessibility. No significant differences in binding between the cancerostatically active and inactive enantiomers with liposomes (archiral systems) were detectable on the basis of spectrophotometric and fluorescence determinations. Cell membrane bound adenylate cyclase is stimulated by ZIMET 54/79, resulting in an increase of 103% in the level of cAMP in mouse L1210 leukemia cells. On examination of structure-activity relationships, it was found that the biological activity (leukemia L1210, P388, Lewis lung carcinoma, melanoma B16, increase in cAMP) is correlated with the particular configuration (6aR,13aS) and type of substituent at positions 3 and 4 of the benzo ring in the case of alkoxy groups and positions 10 and 11 for methyl groups.

This and another 5-FU-resistant cell line (L1210/5-FU-2) showed approximately 50-fold increase in resistance to 5-FU, i.e., IC50 of 5-FU determined for wild type L1210 cells was 3 x 10(-7) M, whereas those for 5-FU-resistant lines, L1210/5-FU-1 and L1210/5-FU-2 were 1.65 x 10(-5) M and 1.35 x 10(-5) M, respectively. The incorporation of 3H-5-FU into L1210/5-FU-1 cells was about 57% of that observed in wild type L1210 cells. Northern blot analysis of DHFR mRNA obtained from 5-FU-sensitive and -resistant cell lines revealed four distinct bands of 1.6 kb, 1.2 kb, 1.0 kb and 0.75 kb in length. Although all these bands showed higher density in autoradiography in 5-FU-resistant lines than in wild type, no extra band was observed. Southern blot analysis of DHFR DNA, digested with the restriction enzymes, EcoRI, BamHI or HindIII, revealed no rearrangement. However, all the fragments were expanded, showing that DHFR gene increased in 5-FU-resistant cells. The karyotype analysis carried out for L1210/5-FU-1 showed abnormal banding region in a part of chromosome X, and this chromosomal aberration was considered to be the reflection of the amplification of DHFR gene. Many investigators have reported that thymidylate synthetase (TS), a target enzyme for 5-FU, increased in 5-FU-resistant cells and that the increase of TS was responsible for the drug resistance to 5-FU. The increase both in DHFR mRNA and DHFR DNA suggested the increase in DHFR and also in N5, N10 methylenetetrahydrofolate (methylene THF), a coenzyme of TS. The increase of methylene THF, together with the increase of TS, might result in the resistance of the cells to 5-FU.","['Konishi, Y', 'Kanamaru, R', 'Ishioka, C', 'Ishikawa, A', 'Shibata, H', 'Wakui, A', 'Dei, T']","['Konishi Y', 'Kanamaru R', 'Ishioka C', 'Ishikawa A', 'Shibata H', 'Wakui A', 'Dei T']","['Department of Clinical Cancer Chemotherapy, Tohoku University, Sendai.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Japan,Tohoku J Exp Med,The Tohoku journal of experimental medicine,0417355,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', 'EC 1.5.1.3 (Tetrahydrofolate Dehydrogenase)', 'U3P01618RT (Fluorouracil)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'DNA, Neoplasm/genetics/metabolism', 'Drug Resistance/genetics', 'Fluorouracil/*pharmacology', 'Gene Amplification/drug effects', 'Leukemia L1210/drug therapy/*enzymology/genetics', 'Mice', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/*metabolism', 'RNA, Neoplasm/genetics/metabolism', 'Tetrahydrofolate Dehydrogenase/genetics/*metabolism']",1990/05/01 00:00,1990/05/01 00:01,['1990/05/01 00:00'],"['1990/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Tohoku J Exp Med. 1990 May;161(1):33-42. doi: 10.1620/tjem.161.33.,,['10.1620/tjem.161.33 [doi]'],,,,,,,,

The first part shows that undernourishment is an adverse prognostic factor in the outcome of treatment of patients with ALL inasmuch as malnourished children, due to diminished bone marrow reserve, receive approximately 50% of the optimal doses of so-called ""maintenance"" chemotherapy, thus leading into frequent bone marrow leukaemic relapses and into a shortened disease-free survival--DFS--(5 year DFS was 83% for well nourished children and only 26% for undernourished children, p less than 0.001). The second part demonstrates that the delivery of sub-optimal doses of myelosuppressive maintenance chemotherapy is by itself, an adverse prognostic factor in the outcome of treatment of children with ALL: five year disease free-survival was 65% and 7% for children receiving either optimal or sub-optimal doses of ablative maintenance chemotherapy (p less than 0.001); accordingly, suboptimal doses of chemotherapy were delivered mainly in undernourished children, due to the abnormally low bone marrow reserve. This third part deals with two additional points: the degree of undernourishment as related to the prognosis and the changes in the nutritional status along with the anti-leukaemic chemotherapy, together with its relationship to the prognosis. In a group of 43 children with standard-risk ALL, we have found that those with a mild to moderate degree of undernourishment do better than those with severe forms of malnutrition (2 year-DFS was 50% and 25% respectively, p less than 0.02), but significantly worse than those with normal nourishment status.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","['Lobato Mendizabal, E', 'Ruiz-Arguelles, G J']","['Lobato Mendizabal E', 'Ruiz-Arguelles GJ']","['Centro de Hematologia y Medicina Interna de Puebla, Hospital Universitario de Puebla, Mexico.']",['spa'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Spain,Sangre (Barc),Sangre,0404373,,IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*administration & dosage/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Nutrition Disorders/*etiology/mortality', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*complications/drug therapy/mortality', 'Prognosis', 'Risk', 'Spain/epidemiology', 'Survival Rate']",1990/06/01 00:00,1990/06/01 00:01,['1990/06/01 00:00'],"['1990/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Sangre (Barc). 1990 Jun;35(3):189-95.,,,Leucemia y desnutricion.

It could be shown that, independent of the tumor stage investigated, the total clearance of mitoguazone is slightly reduced reflecting a moderate increase of AUC in the serum of leukemia-bearing animals. Furthermore, in an advanced tumor stage the drug levels in kidneys, liver, spleen and serum were found to be elevated to some extent in comparison to tumor-free controls in contrast to an earlier stage of leukemia. In conclusion, the tumor stage has to be considered as an important factor to which extent a neoplasia may alter the pharmacokinetics of drugs used for anticancer chemotherapy.","['Amlacher, R', 'Suhnel, J', 'Baumgart, J', 'Mackowiak, A', 'Schulze, W', 'Bubner, M', 'Hoffmann, H']","['Amlacher R', 'Suhnel J', 'Baumgart J', 'Mackowiak A', 'Schulze W', 'Bubner M', 'Hoffmann H']","['Central Institute of Microbiology and Experimental Therapy, Academy of Sciences, GDR, Jena.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Germany,Pharmazie,Die Pharmazie,9800766,['OD5Q0L447W (Mitoguazone)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Body Weight/drug effects', 'Female', 'Leukemia P388/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred Strains', 'Mitoguazone/*pharmacokinetics/pharmacology', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Organ Size/drug effects']",1990/05/01 00:00,1990/05/01 00:01,['1990/05/01 00:00'],"['1990/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Pharmazie. 1990 May;45(5):364-6.,,,,,,,,,,

The combination of the monoclonal antibodies, CD11b, CD15, and CD16, in addition to the forward and orthogonal light scattering signals permitted the isolation of neutrophilic cells from cells of other cell lineages with a purity of greater than 99%. An unexpectedly close relationship was found between the identification of neutrophil maturation by flow cytometry and morphological classification of cells sorted based on cell surface antigen expression and light scattering properties. The neutrophils could be divided into six distinct maturational stages, i.e., stage N I contained predominantly myeloblasts; stage N II, predominantly promyelocytes; stage N III, predominantly early myelocytes; stage N IV, predominantly myelocytes and metamyelocytes; stage N V, predominantly metamyelocytes and bands; and stage VI, predominantly segmented neutrophils.

Results of PFGE studies and in situ hybridization to metaphase chromosomes in the third Ph-positive patient, whose DNA clearly lacked M-BCR rearrangement on Southern analysis, were consistent with a breakpoint on chromosome 22 located 3' of all known exons of the BCR gene.

The findings in this patient may be explained by an unusual genomic breakpoint downstream of the BCR gene associated with long range splicing that excluded all of the 3' BCR exons. Of the five patients with Ph-negative M-BCR non-rearranged CML studied by PFGE for BCR gene rearrangement, none had evidence of rearranged bands. We conclude that PFGE is a valuable adjunct to standard molecular techniques for the study of atypical cases of CML. Occasional patients with Ph-positive CML have breakpoints outside M-BCR. The BCR gene is probably not involved in patients with Ph-negative, M-BCR non-rearranged CML.","['Min, G L', 'Martiat, P', 'Pu, G A', 'Goldman, J']","['Min GL', 'Martiat P', 'Pu GA', 'Goldman J']","['MRC/LRF Leukaemia Unit, Royal Postgraduate Medical School, London, U.K.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,['0 (DNA Probes)'],IM,"['Blotting, Southern', 'Chromosome Fragility', 'Chromosome Mapping', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 22', 'DNA Probes', 'Electrophoresis, Agar Gel/methods', 'Exons', '*Gene Rearrangement', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Chronic, Atypical, BCR-ABL Negative/genetics', '*Oncogenes', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction']",1990/09/01 00:00,1990/09/01 00:01,['1990/09/01 00:00'],"['1990/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 1990 Sep;4(9):650-6.,,,,,,,,,,

All patients had received a standardized first line treatment and were considered refractory against conventional chemotherapy as defined by nonresponse to induction treatment (n = 8), nonresponse to an alternative salvage regimen at first relapse (n = 9), second and third relapses (n = 5) and relapse after bone marrow transplantation (n = 2). Therapy consisted of HD-araC 3 g/m2 q 12 hr days 1-4 and mitoxantrone 10 mg/m2/d days 2-5 or 2-6. Twelve of the 24 patients (50%) achieved a complete remission (CR), one patient had a partial remission, and five patients were nonresponders. Five patients died in aplasia due to infections, one additional patient succumbed to HD-araC related CNS toxicity. Nonhematologic side effects consisted predominantly in infection, nausea and vomiting, mucositis and diarrhea. Recovery of blood counts occurred at a median of 28 days from the onset of treatment; the median time to CR was 33 days. Three of the 12 responders underwent subsequent bone marrow transplantations and one is alive disease free at 40+ months. The median remission duration for the remaining nine patients is 3.5 months, with one case in ongoing CCR at 36+ months; the median survival time is 5 months. Considering the selection of a highly unfavorable group of patients, these data demonstrate a significant antileukemic activity of HAM in refractory ALL and support its application as consolidation treatment during first line ALL therapy.","['Hiddemann, W', 'Buchner, T', 'Heil, G', 'Schumacher, K', 'Diedrich, H', 'Maschmeyer, G', 'Ho, A D', 'Planker, M', 'Gerith-Stolzenburg, S', 'Donhuijsen-Ant, R']","['Hiddemann W', 'Buchner T', 'Heil G', 'Schumacher K', 'Diedrich H', 'Maschmeyer G', 'Ho AD', 'Planker M', 'Gerith-Stolzenburg S', 'Donhuijsen-Ant R', 'et al.']","['Department of Internal Medicine, University of Munster, F.R.G.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', 'BZ114NVM5P (Mitoxantrone)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Diarrhea/chemically induced', 'Drug Evaluation', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mitoxantrone/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Nausea/chemically induced', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/surgery', 'Remission Induction', 'Vomiting/chemically induced']",1990/09/01 00:00,1990/09/01 00:01,['1990/09/01 00:00'],"['1990/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 1990 Sep;4(9):637-40.,,,,,,,,,,

In seven of these cases the blasts were class II+, CD34+ and TdT+, in one were class II+, TdT+, CD7+ while in the remaining leukemia blasts expressed class II only. Cytoplasmic and membrane CD22, CD3, CD13, and Ig as well as membrane CD19, CD10, CD37, CD2, CD33, CD14, glycophorin C, and CD61 were absent. The further characterization of these rare leukemias yielded the following results. The TCR-beta, -gamma and -delta genes were in germline configuration in seven cases studied while IgH genes were rearranged on both alleles in two cases and germline in the other five. By ultrastructural analysis peroxidase activity was detected on unfixed cells in a minority of blasts from four of seven cases. In two of the peroxidase-positive cases a small proportion of blasts also reacted with an anti-myeloperoxidase monoclonal antibody. In one of the peroxidase-negative cases, 7% of blasts were labeled by the antibody, suggesting the presence of peroxidase in its proenzyme form. Importantly, the two cases with Ig gene rearrangements did not have cytochemically or immunologically detectable peroxidase. Three of the nine patients were treated as ALL while six received AML chemotherapy. In five patients complete remission was achieved while the other four died from infections during remission induction. Four patients are still in remission 7, 12, 24, and 30 months after diagnosis while one patient relapsed after 12 months. In conclusion, we have characterized the genotypic and ultrastructural features of subtype of acute leukemia in which blasts expressed immaturity markers and lacked lineage associated antigens. In contrast to previously reported ""unclassifiable"" cases, the leukemias were phenotypically homogeneous and showed a good response to chemotherapy.","['Campana, D', 'Hansen-Hagge, T E', 'Matutes, E', 'Coustan-Smith, E', 'Yokota, S', 'Shetty, V', 'Bartram, C R', 'Janossy, G']","['Campana D', 'Hansen-Hagge TE', 'Matutes E', 'Coustan-Smith E', 'Yokota S', 'Shetty V', 'Bartram CR', 'Janossy G']","['Department of Immunology, Royal Free Hospital School of Medicine, London, U.K.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antigens, Differentiation)', '0 (Enzyme Precursors)', 'EC 1.11.1.- (Peroxidases)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Aged', 'Antigens, Differentiation/analysis', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Enzyme Precursors/analysis', 'Female', 'Gene Rearrangement, B-Lymphocyte, Heavy Chain', 'Gene Rearrangement, T-Lymphocyte', 'Genotype', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Leukemia/*diagnosis/drug therapy/genetics', 'Male', 'Microscopy, Electron', 'Middle Aged', 'Peroxidases/analysis', 'Phenotype', 'Remission Induction']",1990/09/01 00:00,1990/09/01 00:01,['1990/09/01 00:00'],"['1990/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 1990 Sep;4(9):620-4.,['Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom'],,,,,,,,,

Fifteen of those cases were under 10 years of age, seven of whom presented with joint or bone pains. Boys outnumbered girls by almost 5:1 and the ethnic distribution showed a preponderance of patients of East Indian origin. At last follow-up (May 1989), the survival rate of the 15 under-10-year-old patients was 71%. Immunophenotype studies on nine of the 17 patients revealed six carrying T cell markers and three carrying markers suggestive of a pre-B phenotype. HLA tissue typing on 10 patients showed an enhanced frequency of the HLA-B40 antigen when compared with controls (p less than 0.05). This antigen was present in six of the patients typed and four carried the HLA-A2 and B40 antigens together, two of whom also carried the CW3 antigen and the other two carried untypable C antigens. Three of the four carrying HLA-A2 and B40 have died. Two of the three pre-B cases also carried the HLA-A2 and B40 antigens.

Peripheral blood and bone marrow monocytes of leukemic patients could not be distinguished by their cell or organelle stereologic characteristics. Monocytes from patients with both M4 and M5 acute leukemia had relatively large cell and nuclear volumes.

Patients with B-lineage leukemia or NHL demonstrated in 90% an Ig heavy chain gene rearrangement, 6% with an additional light chain kappa gene rearrangement. Combined Ig- with TCR-beta-gene rearrangements were mainly found in patients with common ALL: 19% at first presentation, and 33% in relapse. Moreover, 6 c-ALL patients showed rearrangements in all 3 gene loci (JH-, Ck- and TCR). Based on the developmental hierarchy of Ig- and TCR gene rearrangements it was possible to further subclassify c-ALL into different stages of B cell development. No correlation could be established between the different constellations of gene rearrangements, the number of rearranged fragments and the course of illness. All patients with T-lineage leukemia or NHL demonstrated TCR rearrangements of the beta-, g- and delta-gene loci, two with an additional Ig gene rearrangement. These data confirm recent reports indicating that immunoglobulin heavy chain gene rearrangements are not restricted to B-lineage neoplasms. Furthermore, non-germline configuration was found in tumor cells of every patient with AUL, O-ALL and AHL, permitting a classification to B- or T-cell lineage. Noteworthy is that every AML patient with Ig- and/or TCR gene rearrangements showed a poor or non-response towards therapy. Specimens of individual patients with differently involved tissues at diagnosis always showed an identical rearrangement.

Therefore, the latency period between the acquisition of HTLV-1 and clinical manifestation of ATL can be represented by the age of disease onset.

(1989) J. Biol. Chem. 264, 19076-19080). In this paper, the effects of 1,25-(OH)2D3 on the product of sphingomyelin hydrolysis, ceramide, and the possible function of ceramide as a lipid mediator of the effects of 1,25-(OH)2D3 on HL-60 cell differentiation were investigated. Treatment of HL-60 cells with 1,25-(OH)2D3 resulted in a time- and dose-dependent increase in ceramide mass levels. Ceramide levels peaked at 2 h following treatment of HL-60 cells with 100 nM 1,25-(OH)2D3 with an increase of 41% over base line. The mass of generated ceramide (13 +/- 2 pmol/nmol of phospholipid) agreed with the mass of hydrolyzed sphingomyelin (17 +/- 4 pmol/nmol of phospholipid). Cell-permeable ceramides with shorter N-acyl chains induced HL-60 cell differentiation at subthreshold concentrations of 1,25-(OH)2D3. Higher concentrations of cell-permeable ceramides potently induced HL-60 cell differentiation independent of 1,25-(OH)2D3. A 2-h exposure of HL-60 cells to N-acetyl-sphingosine was sufficient to cause differentiation. Morphologically, N-acetylsphingosine caused a similar monocytic differentiation of HL-60 cells as did 1,25-(OH)2D3. Exogenous ceramide was further metabolized to sphingomyelin and other sphingolipids, but no conversion to sphingosine was detected. Moreover, sphingosine and its analogs failed to affect monocytic differentiation of HL-60 cells in response to subthreshold 1,25-(OH)2D3, indicating that the effect of ceramide was independent of sphingosine generation. These studies demonstrate that ceramide is a lipid mediator that may transduce the action of 1,25-(OH)2D3 on HL-60 cell differentiation.","['Okazaki, T', 'Bielawska, A', 'Bell, R M', 'Hannun, Y A']","['Okazaki T', 'Bielawska A', 'Bell RM', 'Hannun YA']","['Department of Medicine, Duke University Medical Center, Durham, North Carolina 27710.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Ceramides)', '0 (Phosphatidylcholines)', '0 (Phospholipids)', '0 (Sphingomyelins)', 'FXC9231JVH (Calcitriol)']",IM,"['Calcitriol/*pharmacology', 'Cell Differentiation/*drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Ceramides/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute', 'Phosphatidylcholines/metabolism', 'Phospholipids/*metabolism', 'Sphingomyelins/metabolism']",1990/09/15 00:00,1990/09/15 00:01,['1990/09/15 00:00'],"['1990/09/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/09/15 00:01 [medline]', '1990/09/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1990 Sep 15;265(26):15823-31.,"['CA 46738/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'ES 00155/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States']",['S0021-9258(18)55472-7 [pii]'],,,,,,,,

The present studies define the novel phospholipid ceramide 1-phosphate in these cells and present evidence for formation of this compound by preferential utilization of ceramide derived from spingomyelin. A ceramide 1-phosphate standard, prepared enzymatically via diacylglycerol kinase, was utilized for localization. In cells labeled to equilibrium with 32Pi to label the head group of the molecule, the basal ceramide 1-phosphate level was 30 +/- 2 pmol/10(6) cells. Generation of ceramide via the use of exogenous sphingomyelinase resulted in time- and concentration-dependent formation of ceramide 1-phosphate. As little as 3.8 x 10(-5) units/ml was effective and a 3-fold increase was observed with a maximal concentration of 3.8 x 10(-2) units/ml; ED50 approximately 2 x 10(-4) units/ml. This effect was observed by 5 min and maximal at 30 min. Similarly, in cells labeled with [3H]serine to probe the sphingoid base backbone, the basal level of ceramide 1-phosphate was 39 +/- 5 pmol/10(6) and increased 2.5-fold with sphingomyelinase; ED 50 approximately 5 x 10(-5) units/ml. To determine the source of the phosphate moiety, studies were performed with cells short term labeled with 32Pi and resuspended in medium without radiolabel. Under these conditions, sphingomyelin was virtually unlabeled. Nevertheless, sphingomyelin (3.8 x 10(-2) units/ml) induced a 12-fold increase in radiolabel incorporation, suggesting ceramide 1-phosphate formation occurred via ceramide phosphorylation. This event appeared specific for ceramide derived from sphingomyelin since ceramide from glycosphingolipids was not converted to ceramide 1-phosphate. In sum, these studies demonstrate the novel phospholipid ceramide 1-phosphate in HL-60 cells and suggest the possibility that a path exists from sphingomyelin to ceramide 1-phosphate via the phosphorylation of ceramide.","['Dressler, K A', 'Kolesnick, R N']","['Dressler KA', 'Kolesnick RN']","['Department of Medicine, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, Cornell University Medical College, New York, New York 10021.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Ceramides)', '0 (Phosphates)', '0 (Phosphorus Radioisotopes)', '0 (Sphingomyelins)', '0 (ceramide 1-phosphate)', 'EC 3.1.4.12 (Sphingomyelin Phosphodiesterase)', 'EC 3.2.1.- (Glycoside Hydrolases)', 'EC 3.2.1.123 (endoglycoceramidase)']",IM,"['Autoradiography', 'Cell Line', 'Ceramides/*biosynthesis/*metabolism', 'Glycoside Hydrolases/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute', 'Phosphates/metabolism', 'Phosphorus Radioisotopes', 'Sphingomyelin Phosphodiesterase/metabolism', 'Sphingomyelins/*metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/*metabolism']",1990/09/05 00:00,1990/09/05 00:01,['1990/09/05 00:00'],"['1990/09/05 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/09/05 00:01 [medline]', '1990/09/05 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1990 Sep 5;265(25):14917-21.,['R01-CA-42385/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],['S0021-9258(18)77204-9 [pii]'],,,,,,,,

The diagnosis of malignant meningitis was confirmed by malignant or 'suspicious' cerebrospinal fluid cytology in 13/20 patients. The 6th and 7th cranial nerves were most commonly involved. Multiple nerve involvement was present in 11/20 patients, for a total of 42 nerves affected. Treatment consisted of whole brain irradiation to a median dose of 2400 cGy (range: 1000-3000) at 200-300 cGy per fraction. Median survival was 7 months. Forty of 42 nerves improved, for an actuarial response rate of 95% at 3 months. The complete response rate was 44% and was better for patients with lymphoma than for those with leukemia (72% vs 19%, p = 0.04). Delaying initiation of irradiation more than 3 days after the onset of symptoms did not affect the ultimate response rate, but slightly increased the median time to response (9 days vs 14 days, p = 0.1). Radiation therapy is an effective means of reversing cranial nerve dysfunction in leukemia and lymphoma. Higher doses may be needed to increase the rate of complete response.","['Gray, J R', 'Wallner, K E']","['Gray JR', 'Wallner KE']","['Department of Radiation Oncology, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY 10021.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys,"International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics",7603616,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Cranial Nerve Diseases/etiology/*radiotherapy', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*complications/radiotherapy', 'Lymphoma/*complications/radiotherapy', 'Male', 'Meningeal Neoplasms/*complications/radiotherapy', 'Middle Aged', 'Paralysis/etiology/*radiotherapy']",1990/08/01 00:00,1990/08/01 00:01,['1990/08/01 00:00'],"['1990/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 1990 Aug;19(2):439-44. doi: 10.1016/0360-3016(90)90555-x.,,"['0360-3016(90)90555-X [pii]', '10.1016/0360-3016(90)90555-x [doi]']",,,,,,,,

Role of the immune system in the inhibition of visceral metastases.,468-74,"DBA/2 mice were injected i.v. with IFN alpha/beta-resistant 3CI8 Friend erythroleukemia cells (FLC) which metastasize to the liver and spleen. IFN alpha/beta treatment of FLC-injected mice increased their survival time and these mice developed a resistance to a second challenge with FLC. The efficacy of IFN alpha/beta in increasing the survival time was compared between normal immunocompetent and immunodeficient mice. The anti-tumor action of IFN was markedly reduced or abolished in newborn DBA/2 mice, in adult athymic nu/nu and beige DBA/2 mice, and in BALB/c scid/scid mice. To determine the phenotype of the effector cells involved, FLC-injected DBA/2 mice were treated with antibodies to asialo-GMI, CD4, or CD8 antigens, or with cyclosporin A or silica. IFN alpha/beta treatment proved much less effective in these mice, indicating that a variety of effector cell types participated in the IFN-induced suppression of visceral metastases. Thus, an intact immune system appears to be essential to obtain optimal therapeutic effects of IFN alpha/beta in this experimental model.","['Gresser, I', 'Maury, C', 'Carnaud, C', 'De Maeyer, E', 'Maunoury, M T', 'Belardelli, F']","['Gresser I', 'Maury C', 'Carnaud C', 'De Maeyer E', 'Maunoury MT', 'Belardelli F']","['Institut de Recherches Scientifiques sur le Cancer, C.N.R.S., Villejuif, Paris, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,"['0 (Antibodies)', '0 (Cyclosporins)', '0 (Interferon Type I)', '0 (Interleukin-2)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies/therapeutic use', 'Cyclosporins/therapeutic use', 'Drug Resistance/genetics', 'Friend murine leukemia virus', 'Interferon Type I/*therapeutic use', 'Interleukin-2/therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*drug therapy', 'Liver Neoplasms/prevention & control/*secondary', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred DBA', 'Mice, Mutant Strains', 'Mice, Nude', '*Neoplastic Cells, Circulating', 'Splenic Neoplasms/prevention & control/*secondary', 'Tumor Virus Infections/*drug therapy/genetics']",1990/09/15 00:00,1990/09/15 00:01,['1990/09/15 00:00'],"['1990/09/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/09/15 00:01 [medline]', '1990/09/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Int J Cancer. 1990 Sep 15;46(3):468-74. doi: 10.1002/ijc.2910460324.,,['10.1002/ijc.2910460324 [doi]'],,,,,,,,

Its functional properties remain obscure; however, the N-terminal peptidic sequence could have a regulatory function on hematopoietic stem cell proliferation. To investigate the mechanism of T beta 4 expression, we studied T beta 4 gene expression in various leukemic cells and in established cell lines. Among leukemic cell samples obtained from leukemia patients, the T beta 4 gene was highly expressed in a lymphoid lineage, especially in adult T-cell leukemia (ATL) cells, rather than in a granulocyte lineage. The T beta 4 gene was more transcriptionally active in chronic B-cell leukemia than in acute B-cell leukemia, while it was inactive in plasma cell leukemia. We also found that cells from one of the ATL patients transcribed a heterogeneous message. T beta 4 messenger RNA increased in MOLT-3 during differentiation by 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA), in HL60 cells induced by TPA or dimethylsulfoxide and K562 cells stimulated by cytosine arabinoside or hemin. The genomic sequence of T beta 4 is considered to be highly conserved. Only 1 of 20 genomes from normal or hematopoietic malignant cells showed restriction fragment length polymorphism. These findings, along with previous data, suggest that T beta 4 may be a new marker of differentiation of hematopoietic cells.","['Shimamura, R', 'Kudo, J', 'Kondo, H', 'Dohmen, K', 'Gondo, H', 'Okamura, S', 'Ishibashi, H', 'Niho, Y']","['Shimamura R', 'Kudo J', 'Kondo H', 'Dohmen K', 'Gondo H', 'Okamura S', 'Ishibashi H', 'Niho Y']","['First Department of Internal Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Kyushu University, Fukuoka, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (RNA, Messenger)', '549LM7U24W (thymosin beta(4))', '61512-21-8 (Thymosin)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Female', '*Gene Expression Regulation', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*cytology/drug effects/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia/*blood', 'Leukocytes/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Reference Values', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Thymosin/*analogs & derivatives/genetics', 'Transcription, Genetic']",1990/09/01 00:00,1990/09/01 00:01,['1990/09/01 00:00'],"['1990/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 1990 Sep 1;76(5):977-84.,,['S0006-4971(20)74499-X [pii]'],,,,,,,,

The bioactivities of these compounds have been evaluated in five different cell lines (WEHI 3B, C653, X63/OMIL3, R6X-B15, and HL-60) and compared with the activities of 1-O-hexadecyl-2-O-methyl-sn-3-glycerophosphocholine (GPC) and its enantiomer, 3-O-hexadecyl-2-O-methyl-sn-1-GPC. The results indicate that a alpha-D-thioglucopyranoside [1-O-hexadecyl-2-O-methyl-3-S-(alpha-D-1'- thioglucopyranosyl-sn-glycerol)] is selective with respect to its action on target cells, with high activity for killing of WEHI 3B and C653 cells as determined by inhibition of [3H]thymidine incorporation into DNA and HL-60 cell cytotoxicity, but unable to induce aggregation of rabbit platelets at 10(-5) M. The corresponding beta-linked thioglycolipid was ineffective with respect to cytotoxicity against each cell line tested, indicating the importance of configuration at the anomeric position; the beta-thioglycoside was also ineffective with respect to inducing platelet aggregation. 1-O-Hexadecyl-2-O-methyl-sn-3-GPC and 3-O-hexadecyl-2-O-methyl-sn-1-GPC were potent inhibitors of growth of each cell line tested but also caused rabbit platelet aggregation at concentrations greater than or equal to 10(-7) M.

They are also subject to very rapid proteolytic decomposition, even at physiological pH. The acylated analogues 1,3-dialkyl-3-acyltrizenes are much more stable in aqueous solution, but they also give rise to alkyldiazonium ions. Four acylated 1,3-dimethyltriazenes, where the acyl groups were diethylphosphoryl (DMP), carbethoxy (DMC), acetyl (DMA), and N-methylcarbamoyl (DMM), were studied kinetically. Rate-pH profiles indicated that the acyl group had a profound effect on the mechanism of decomposition. The cytotoxic potential of all four compounds was studied in vitro by using the MTT-tetrazolium assay. The compounds had fair-to-good activity against some cell lines, particularly those deficient in methylation repair. In vivo assays of DMC and DMM against several tumor xenografts in nude mice showed promising activity for some cancers, particularly in the case of DMM. In vitro assays were also carried out on three 1-(2-chloroethyl)-3-methyl-3-acyltriazenes. The acyl groups were carbethoxy (CMC), acetyl (CMA), and N-methylcarbamoyl (CMM). The activity of these compounds largely paralleled that of bis(2-chloroethyl)-N-nitrosourea (BCNU), except for those cell lines which exhibited the Rem phenotype; triazenes were more active in those lines than BCNU. The in vivo activity of CMC, CMA, and CMM was tested in the P388 leukemia assay. All three were active but CMC and CMA proved to be rather toxic. CMM was well tolerated and was examined in several tumor xenografts in nude mice. Significant activity was found against MX-1 mammary carcinoma, against LX-1 small cell lung carcinoma, and particularly against LOX amelanotic melanoma, where complete cures were effected. The antineoplastic activity of the acyltriazenes is well-correlated with their chemical behavior.","['Smith, R H Jr', 'Scudiero, D A', 'Michejda, C J']","['Smith RH Jr', 'Scudiero DA', 'Michejda CJ']","['Laboratory of Chemical and Physical Carcinogenesis, ABL-Basic Research Program, NCI-Frederick Cancer Research and Development Center, Maryland 21701.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Med Chem,Journal of medicinal chemistry,9716531,"['0 (Alkylating Agents)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Triazenes)']",IM,"['Alkylating Agents/*chemical synthesis/pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*chemical synthesis/pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use', 'Chemical Phenomena', 'Chemistry', 'Half-Life', 'Mice', 'Mice, Nude', 'Neoplasms, Experimental/drug therapy', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Triazenes/*chemical synthesis/pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects']",1990/09/01 00:00,2001/03/28 10:01,['1990/09/01 00:00'],"['1990/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1990/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Med Chem. 1990 Sep;33(9):2579-83. doi: 10.1021/jm00171a036.,"['N01-C0-74102/PHS HHS/United States', 'N01-CO-74101/CO/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",['10.1021/jm00171a036 [doi]'],,,,,,,,

But ovarian tumor-forming-leukemia is relatively rare, hence not enough is known about it. Recently, the authors experienced a case of young woman with recurrent leukemia which manifested as a giant ovarian tumor. She suffered from acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) in February, 1986, and received chemotherapy (predonisolone and cytocine arabinoside) until complete remission in peripheral blood. But she developed a giant abdominal tumor in May, 1988, and admitted to our hospital for close examination and treatment. Preoperative blood examination was within normal range, and peripheral blood smear revealed no leukemic blasts. She had a giant abdominal tumor occupying whole abdominal cavity, and the tumor showed solid pattern in ultra-sonography, CT and NMR-CT. Malignant lower abdominal tumor was suspected, and simple abdominal hysterectomy, bilateral salphingo-oophorectomy and omentumectomy was performed on 27th. May, 1988. A giant abdominal tumor developed from left ovary, infiltrating to the uterus through left Fallopian tube, and metastatic lesion at omentum were present. Postoperative pathological findings in immunochemistry showed that the tumor was recurrence of ALL as tumor-forming-leukemia. After operation, she was treated in the department of internal medicine for postoperative chemotherapy (TCMP-therapy 1 kur) and discharged in December, 1988. She is alive and healthy 10 months after operation, and reveals no signs of recurrence. It was important to recognize lower abdominal tumor in leukemic patients as gynecologic problem, and significance of surgical approach to ovarian tumor-forming-leukemia was indicated.","['Okamura, M', 'Akabori, T', 'Takeuchi, S', 'Yamazaki, M', 'Mochizuki, M', 'Itoh, H']","['Okamura M', 'Akabori T', 'Takeuchi S', 'Yamazaki M', 'Mochizuki M', 'Itoh H']","['Department of Gynecology and Obstetrics, Kobe University School of Medicine.']",['jpn'],"['Case Reports', 'English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Japan,Nihon Gan Chiryo Gakkai Shi,Nihon Gan Chiryo Gakkai shi,7505713,,IM,"['Adult', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Ovarian Neoplasms/*pathology/surgery', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*pathology/surgery', 'Tomography, X-Ray Computed']",1990/05/20 00:00,1990/05/20 00:01,['1990/05/20 00:00'],"['1990/05/20 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/05/20 00:01 [medline]', '1990/05/20 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Nihon Gan Chiryo Gakkai Shi. 1990 May 20;25(5):1032-7.,,,,,,,,,,

Four groups were investigated; recipients of non-T-cell depleted allografts without graft-versus-host disease (GvHD), recipients of non-T-cell depleted allografts with GvHD, recipients of T-cell depleted allografts, and recipients of genetically identical twin transplants compared with recipients of non-T-cell depleted allografts without GvHD, Decreased relapse was observed in recipients of non-T-cell depleted allografts with acute (relative risk 0.68, P = 0.03), chronic (relative risk, 0.43, P = 0.01), and both acute and chronic GvHD (relative risk 0.33, P = 0.0001). These data support an anti-leukemia effect of GvHD. AML patients receiving identical twin transplants had an increased probability of relapse (relative risk 2.58, P = 0.008) compared to allograft recipients without GvHD supporting an anti-leukemia effect of allografts independent of GvHD. CML patients receiving T-cell depleted transplants without GvHD had a higher probability of relapse (relative risk 6.91, P = 0.0001) than recipients of non-T-cell depleted allografts without GvHD. These data support an antileukemia effect independent of GvHD altered by T-cell depletion.

He recovered from acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) grade III-IV of skin, liver and gut, but chronic GVHD of progressive onset developed. On day 556 post-graft severe thrombocytopenia was resistant to prednisolone, cyclophosphamide and high dose immunoglobulin. Splenectomy was followed by a normalization of platelet counts. The subsequent clinical course was characterized by progressive muscular atrophy and weight loss. Dysphagia, dysarthria, cachexia and ultimately recurrent pneumonic episodes ensued. The cachectic patient developed a highly abnormal breathing pattern with hypoventilation and intermittent apnea requiring mechanical ventilation. Auditory evoked potentials revealed a considerable dysfunction of the brainstem. The patient died on day 1120 post-graft from pneumonia, aggravated by thoracic muscular insufficiency. Postmortem examination revealed diffuse predominantly lymphoid perivascular infiltration in meninges and CNS tissue; proliferation of activated microglial cells expressing the HLA-DR antigen was prominent in the brainstem. These histologic changes are similar to those observed in the CNS in experimental GVHD.

According to alkaline elution analysis, single-strand breaks (SSB) occur in both cell types. DNA-protein and interstrand crosslinks are prominent features of TG effects in L1210, CEM, and HL-60 but not CHO cells. To assess which DNA strand experiences SSB in CHO cells, the cells were synchronized by growth to confluence (late G1, S). The cells were then diluted into fresh medium so that they underwent a round of division during a subsequent 16-hr interval. They were treated with TG during this first cell cycle, and mitotic cells were harvested at the end of the first cycle using colcemid. SSB were determined in parental DNA (radiolabeled with thymidine during growth to confluence), TG-containing DNA (radiolabeled with [14C]TG during drug exposure), and daughter DNA (labeled with thymidine during the second cell cycle). SSB occurred in TG-containing DNA late in the second cell cycle after drug exposure and in the DNA synthesized from a TG-DNA template (daughter DNA). This observation is consistent with the known delayed cytotoxicity and chromosomal aberrations seen in CHO cells. The SSB suggest relatively normal elongation of DNA containing TG but altered synthesis and/or ligation from a TG-DNA template. This premise was tested in synchronized CHO cells. The DNA strand incorporating TG elongated naturally; however, DNA elongation was impaired in the cell cycle following TG treatment. The results are consistent with SSB in daughter DNA synthesized from a TG-DNA template due to inability to elongate the newly-synthesized strand.","['Pan, B F', 'Nelson, J A']","['Pan BF', 'Nelson JA']","['Department of Experimental Pediatrics, University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston 77030.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Biochem Pharmacol,Biochemical pharmacology,0101032,"['0 (Cross-Linking Reagents)', '0 (DNA, Single-Stranded)', 'FTK8U1GZNX (Thioguanine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cells, Cultured/drug effects', 'Cricetinae', 'Cross-Linking Reagents', '*DNA Damage', 'DNA, Single-Stranded/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia L1210/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Ovary/drug effects/metabolism', 'Thioguanine/*toxicity']",1990/09/01 00:00,1990/09/01 00:01,['1990/09/01 00:00'],"['1990/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Biochem Pharmacol. 1990 Sep 1;40(5):1063-9. doi: 10.1016/0006-2952(90)90494-6.,"['CA-16672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-28034/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['0006-2952(90)90494-6 [pii]', '10.1016/0006-2952(90)90494-6 [doi]']",,,,,,,,

The principal cancers considered were leukemia and childhood malignancies. Estimates of the emissions delivered to small geographic study tracts were derived from mathematical dispersion models which accounted for modifying factors such as wind and terrain; the model of accident emissions was validated by readings from off-site dosimeters. Incident cancers among area residents for the period 1975-1985 (n = 5,493) were identified by a review of the records at all local and regional hospitals; preaccident and postaccident trends in cancer rates were examined. For accident emissions, the authors failed to find definite effects of exposure on the cancer types and population subgroups thought to be most susceptible to radiation. No associations were seen for leukemia in adults or for childhood cancers as a group. For leukemia in children, the odds ratio was raised, but cases were few (n = 4), and the estimate was highly variable. Moreover, rates of childhood leukemia in the Three Mile Island area are low compared with national and regional rates. For exposure to routine emissions, the odds ratios were raised for childhood cancers as a whole and for childhood leukemia, but confidence intervals were wide and included 1.0. For leukemia in adults, there was a negative trend. Trends for two types of cancer ran counter to expectation. Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma showed raised risks relative to both accident and routine emissions; lung cancer (adjusted only indirectly for smoking) showed raised risks relative to accident emissions, routine emissions, and background gamma radiation. Overall, the pattern of results does not provide convincing evidence that radiation releases from the Three Mile Island nuclear facility influenced cancer risk during the limited period of follow-up.","['Hatch, M C', 'Beyea, J', 'Nieves, J W', 'Susser, M']","['Hatch MC', 'Beyea J', 'Nieves JW', 'Susser M']","['Div. of Epidemiology, Columbia U.

There was no significant increase in NK activity when either the HC targets or NK-enriched cells were preincubated with dCF. However, preincubation of both HC and NK cells with dCF resulted in increased NK activity. Culture of enriched NK cells with IFN-alpha enhanced their activity. However, preincubation of HC targets with this drug in the presence or absence of dCF resulted in a protective effect. Maximal NK activity towards HCL was obtained when the target tumour cells were separately precultured with dCF and the NK-enriched effectors precultured with dCF + IFN-alpha. The effect of dCF and IFN-alpha was also measured using the standard K562 cells as targets for NK activity. dCF enhanced NK activity following preculture of both effector and target K562 cells, but IFN-alpha did not reduce K562 cell susceptibility to NK lysis as it did for HC cells. Our findings suggest that (a) dCF and IFN-alpha, which are used to treat HC, could function via activation of NK cells, (b) effects on both effector and tumour target cells should be taken into account, and (c) caution should be exercised in extrapolating the effects of NK-cell activity against K562 cells to those on HC targets.","['Lahat, N', 'Aghai, E', 'Merchav, S', 'Kinarty, A', 'Sobel, E', 'Froom, P']","['Lahat N', 'Aghai E', 'Merchav S', 'Kinarty A', 'Sobel E', 'Froom P']","['Immunology Unit, Lady Davis Carmel Hospital, Haifa, Israel.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Scand J Immunol,Scandinavian journal of immunology,0323767,"['0 (Interferon Type I)', '395575MZO7 (Pentostatin)']",IM,"['Cytotoxicity, Immunologic/immunology', 'Humans', 'Interferon Type I/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*drug effects/immunology', 'Leukemia, Hairy Cell/drug therapy/*immunology', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/immunology', 'Lymphocyte Activation/drug effects', 'Pentostatin/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1990/08/01 00:00,1990/08/01 00:01,['1990/08/01 00:00'],"['1990/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Scand J Immunol. 1990 Aug;32(2):205-9. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-3083.1990.tb02911.x.,,['10.1111/j.1365-3083.1990.tb02911.x [doi]'],,,,,,,,

As a screening test, the X-ray diagnosis with barium contrast medium is used and the risk of X-ray exposure must be considered in order to compare with the benefit of the mass screening. We have reported in the previous article in 1977 that the benefit and risk of stomach cancer mass screening become equal at age of 40 y.o. Since then, various conditions with the mass screening of stomach cancer have changed so that reevaluation of the benefit and risk relationship is necessary. Especially the risk coefficient of radiation-induced stomach cancer has been revised drastically in the report of United Nations Scientific Committee on the effects of radiation in 1988. So, in this report, the benefit of mass screening of stomach cancer is defined as the net elongation of average life expectancy due to the life saved, and the risk of the screening is defined as the net shortage of average life expectancy due to the radiation-induced stomach cancer and leukemia. Since the benefit increases rapidly with age and the risk decreases with age, a certain age at which the benefit and risk become identical should be found and under this age the mass screening is not justified to be performed. Assuming X-ray dose equivalent to stomach of 10 mSv and risk coefficient of stomach cancer of 12.6 X 10(-3) Sv-1 from the United Nations report, the critical age is found to be about 35 y.o. for men and women.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","['Iinuma, T', 'Tateno, Y']","['Iinuma T', 'Tateno Y']","['Division of Clinical Research, National Institute of Radiological Sciences.']",['jpn'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Japan,Nihon Igaku Hoshasen Gakkai Zasshi,Nihon Igaku Hoshasen Gakkai zasshi.

FDA fluorescence was linearly related to viable cell number within a wide range of cell densities (3-4 logs) as well as in the presence of different added proportions of dead cells. The assay reliably detects high and low grade resistance to vincristine (vcr) and daunorubicin, respectively, as well as the subsequent reversal of vcr resistance by cyclosporin A and the calcium channel blocker verapamil. Using ALL cell lines, drug sensitivity was in good correspondence with data obtained by the microculture tetrazolium assay.

The translocation results in the translation of an aberrant abl-related protein with tyrosine kinase activity. Genetically active genes are known to have chromatin which is hypersensitive to deoxyribonuclease I (DNase I) and to be hypomethylated. Using an in situ nick translation technique on metaphase chromosomes, we have examined DNase I sensitivity and methylation status at the breakpoints 9q34 and 22q11 in bone marrow cells from controls (two cases) and CML patients (three cases). In CML cells DNase I sensitivity was significantly increased, at both breakpoints, in the translocated chromosomes compared with their normal homologues in CML cells and with both homologues in control marrows. A hypermethylated site, seen at 22q11 in normal 22s was hypomethylated on 22q-. The 9q34 region was hypomethylated in normal and translocated chromosomes. DNase I sensitivity, seen at 22q13 in CML cells, was lost following translocation in one of three cases. This technique demonstrates alterations in chromatin conformation and methylation status at translocation breakpoints which may be related to acquired genetic activity at one or both of these sites.","['Yamada, T', 'Secker-Walker, L M']","['Yamada T', 'Secker-Walker LM']","['Department of Haematology, Royal Free Hospital School of Medicine, London, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Chromatin)', 'EC 3.1.21.1 (Deoxyribonuclease I)']",IM,"['Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Chromatin/metabolism', '*Chromosome Fragility', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 22', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 9', 'Chronic Disease', 'Deoxyribonuclease I/metabolism', 'Gene Expression', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Male', 'Metaphase', 'Methylation', 'Middle Aged', '*Oncogenes', '*Philadelphia Chromosome', '*Translocation, Genetic']",1990/05/01 00:00,1990/05/01 00:01,['1990/05/01 00:00'],"['1990/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 1990 May;4(5):341-4.,,,,,,,,,,

The results were compared with controls in which cells were exposed to the individual drug only and seeded after appropriate intervals. Simultaneous exposure to two drugs produced lethal effects, but no more than those produced by doxorubicin or mitoxantrone alone. Ara-C followed by doxorubicin produced time-dependent increases in cell kill that was parallel to the doxorubicin alone control, indicative of no true potentiation. In contrast, ara-C followed by mitoxantrone produced striking increases in cell kill effects. Thus, ara-C followed by mitoxantrone resulted in more than 10-fold increases in cell kill at the intervals of greater than or equal to 8 hr between exposures, and the strong cell kill effects were maintained.

We report that of 163 children with ALL seen at the King Faisal Specialist Hospital and Research Centre, we find that their median age was 5.0 years with a modal value of 3 years, with a range of 4 months to 14 years; that there were 93 cALL patients who were predominantly young (median age 5.0 years).

From five normal controls and 14 CML patients in chronic phase, bone marrow samples were taken before treatment and tested for antiproliferative activity by rIFN-alpha-2C, using a microagar culture system for BFU-E, CFU-GM, and CFU-Meg. Light-density nucleated bone marrow cells were stimulated for BFU-E and CFU-Meg colony formation with Alpha medium containing 20% serum obtained from a patient with severe aplastic anaemia. CFU-GM growth was induced with conditioned medium from the cell line GCT. In normal controls BFU-E, CFU-GM and CFU-Meg colony formation was inhibited by rIFN-alpha-2C in a dose-dependent manner. BFU-E proved to be the most sensitive cell lineage (IC50: 65; range: 53-116 U/ml) whereas CFU-GM was about 20 times less sensitive (IC50: 643; range: 480-897 U/ml). The sensitivity of CFU-Meg ranged between these two colony types with 50% growth inhibition at an IFN concentration of 160 (range: 68-246 U/ml). A heterogeneous response to rIFN-alpha-2C in vitro was seen in CML patients. Three of the 14 patients were 'resistant' to rIFN-alpha-2C in vitro with IC50 values for BFU-E, CFU-GM and/or CFU-Meg colony formation greater than 10(4) U/ml. Patients were subsequently treated with a daily dose of rIFN-alpha-2C of 5 x 10(6) U. Four patients achieved a complete and six achieved a partial haematological response. Of the four non-responders three rapidly progressed into blastic crisis. Thus it was seen that treatment failure to interferon was accompanied by IFN-resistance in vitro of BFU-E, CFU-GM and/or CFU-Meg colony formation by bone marrow precursors (p less than 0.01). These results suggest a predictive value of IFN-sensitivity testing in vitro in Ph1 + CML.","['Geissler, D', 'Gastl, G', 'Aulitzky, W', 'Tilg, H', 'Gaggl, S', 'Konwalinka, G', 'Huber, C']","['Geissler D', 'Gastl G', 'Aulitzky W', 'Tilg H', 'Gaggl S', 'Konwalinka G', 'Huber C']","['Department of Internal Medicine, University Hospital, Innsbruck, Austria.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,"['0 (Interferon Type I)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Female', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Interferon Type I/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/pathology/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Recombinant Proteins']",1990/01/01 00:00,1990/01/01 00:01,['1990/01/01 00:00'],"['1990/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 1990;14(7):629-36. doi: 10.1016/0145-2126(90)90018-5.,,"['0145-2126(90)90018-5 [pii]', '10.1016/0145-2126(90)90018-5 [doi]']",,,,,,,,

To understand the mechanism of the high incidence of hypercalcemia in ATL, we studied the expression of a parathyroid hormone-related protein (PTHrP) gene that has been proposed as a causative factor of hypercalcemia in some solid tumors. The polymerase chain reaction coupled with reverse transcription of mRNA was applied to RNA from peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Cells from all 13 ATL patients examined showed abundant expression of the PTHrP gene, while cells from uninfected normal subjects did not. Significant expression of PTHrP gene was also detected in HTLV-1 carriers without any symptoms and in patients with HTLV-1-associated myelopathy or tropical spastic paraparesis. PTHrP mRNA levels correlated with the number of infected cells that were estimated by the integrated HTLV-1 DNA. These results suggest that HTLV-1-infected cells are expressing the PTHrP gene. This concept was further supported by the finding that the HTLV-1 trans-activator, the tax gene product, caused trans-activation of the PTHrP gene promoter linked to the CAT gene. These observations might explain the general expression of the PTHrP gene in ATL patients and the high incidence of hypercalcemia in ATL.","['Watanabe, T', 'Yamaguchi, K', 'Takatsuki, K', 'Osame, M', 'Yoshida, M']","['Watanabe T', 'Yamaguchi K', 'Takatsuki K', 'Osame M', 'Yoshida M']","['Department of Viral Oncology, Cancer Institute, Toshima-ku, Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Exp Med,The Journal of experimental medicine,2985109R,"['0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (Oligonucleotide Probes)', '0 (PTHLH protein, human)', '0 (Parathyroid Hormone)', '0 (Parathyroid Hormone-Related Protein)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Trans-Activators)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Carrier State', 'Cell Line', 'DNA, Viral/genetics', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Viral', '*Genes, Viral', 'HTLV-I Infections/*genetics', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*genetics', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Oligonucleotide Probes', 'Parathyroid Hormone/*genetics', 'Parathyroid Hormone-Related Protein', 'Plasmids', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Proteins/*genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Restriction Mapping', 'Trans-Activators/*genetics', 'Transcription, Genetic', '*Transcriptional Activation', 'Transfection']",1990/09/01 00:00,1990/09/01 00:01,['1990/09/01 00:00'],"['1990/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Exp Med. 1990 Sep 1;172(3):759-65. doi: 10.1084/jem.172.3.759.,,['10.1084/jem.172.3.759 [doi]'],,PMC2188541,,,,,,

We report here on the detection of human IL-5 receptors on eosinophilic sublines of the promyelocytic leukemia HL-60. Sodium butyrate, which initiates differentiation to mature eosinophils, also induces the appearance of high affinity (Kd 1-5 X 10(-11) M) IL-5 binding sites on these cells. The receptors are specific for IL-5, since binding of radiolabeled ligand can only be inhibited with homologous or murine IL-5 and not by other cytokines. We further show that the receptors are functional, since IL-5 can stimulate the proliferation of these cells. Affinity crosslinking of surface-bound 125I human IL-5 or 35S mouse IL-5 identified two membrane polypeptides of approximately 60 and approximately 130 kD to which IL-5 is closely associated. The presence of granulocyte/macrophage-colony-stimulating factor or tumor necrosis factor during butyrate induction decreased the expression of IL-5 binding sites compared with control cultures. The identification and characterization of human IL-5 receptors on HL-60 sublines should provide new insight into the role of this cytokine in eosinophil differentiation.","['Plaetinck, G', 'Van der Heyden, J', 'Tavernier, J', 'Fache, I', 'Tuypens, T', 'Fischkoff, S', 'Fiers, W', 'Devos, R']","['Plaetinck G', 'Van der Heyden J', 'Tavernier J', 'Fache I', 'Tuypens T', 'Fischkoff S', 'Fiers W', 'Devos R']","['Roche Research Gent, Ghent, Belgium.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Exp Med,The Journal of experimental medicine,2985109R,"['0 (Butyrates)', '0 (Interleukin-5)', '0 (Receptors, Immunologic)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-5)', '107-92-6 (Butyric Acid)']",IM,"['Butyrates/pharmacology', 'Butyric Acid', 'Cell Line', 'Clone Cells', 'Eosinophils/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-5/*metabolism', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute', 'Receptors, Immunologic/biosynthesis/isolation & purification/*metabolism', '*Receptors, Interleukin', 'Receptors, Interleukin-5', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects/*immunology']",1990/09/01 00:00,1990/09/01 00:01,['1990/09/01 00:00'],"['1990/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Exp Med. 1990 Sep 1;172(3):683-91. doi: 10.1084/jem.172.3.683.,,['10.1084/jem.172.3.683 [doi]'],,PMC2188565,,,,,,

However, the inhibitory effect of MC on myeloid cell lines has been reported. To assess the effect of MC on human leukemic progenitor cell growth (acute myeloblastic leukemia colony-forming units, AML-CFU), increasing concentrations of MC (0.36%, 0.72%, and 1.44%) were added in a double-feeder culture system. T-lymphocyte-depleted leukemic cells from 12 patients with AML were cultured in the presence of 2.5% phytohemagglutinin (PHA) in a liquid and a semisolid (MC) medium over a leukocyte feeder layer. The leukemic nature of the colonies was confirmed by cytogenetic studies. The median cloning efficiency in the optimal MC assay system was significantly higher (217 leukemic colony-forming units [CFU-L]/5 x 10(4) cells) than the one obtained in the liquid assay system (72.5 CFU-L/5 x 10(4) cells). However, three patterns of growth were observed: 1) colony formation was significantly better in MC than in the liquid assay system (seven of ten cases), 2) there was no difference in growth response (three of ten cases), and 3) colony formation was significantly better in the liquid assay system (one of ten cases). In the semisolid assay system, colony growth was dependent on MC concentration and varied among individual patients. A striking feature was the partial reduction of AML-CFU growth at 1.44% MC, with complete inhibition in 4/11 cases. This phenomenon was not observed for normal progenitors cultured under the same conditions. Cytological evaluation of AML-CFU showed an incomplete maturation to the myelocyte state, accompanied occasionally by macrophagic differentiation. In contrast, maturation of the granulocyte-macrophage colony-forming unit (CFU-GM) clones was harmonious, resulting in greater than 40% polynuclear cells, even from a 7-day culture. Despite a variable clonal response of leukemic progenitors from individual patients, we conclude that 0.72% MC is the optimal concentration of MC in our system, allowing clonal growth of AML-CFU.","['Allieri, M A', 'Douay, L', 'Deloux, J', 'Smadja, N', 'Najman, A', 'Gorin, N C']","['Allieri MA', 'Douay L', 'Deloux J', 'Smadja N', 'Najman A', 'Gorin NC']","[""Laboratoire d'Etude de l'Hematopoiese-Unite de recherche sur les greffes de cellules souches hematopoietiques, Formation Associee Claude Bernard, CHU St. Antoine, Paris, France.""]",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,"['0 (Phytohemagglutinins)', '9004-67-5 (Methylcellulose)']",IM,"['Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Clone Cells/cytology', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Granulocytes/pathology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*pathology', 'Macrophages/pathology', 'Methylcellulose/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Phytohemagglutinins/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1990/09/01 00:00,1990/09/01 00:01,['1990/09/01 00:00'],"['1990/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Exp Hematol. 1990 Sep;18(8):911-5.,,,,,,,,,,

We have recently shown, however, that this mutant gene is expressed in odontoblasts of transplanted teeth derived from homozygous and heterozygous carrier embryos. The expression of the Mov13 allele has now been followed throughout in vivo development of mandibular teeth and bone in heterozygous animals, by in situ hybridization with a probe that specifically recognizes transcripts of the mutant gene. We show that the onset of its transcription precisely coincides with the final differentiation of odontoblasts and the onset of dentinogenesis, i.e. on day E16 for the incisor and at birth for the first molar. The mutant allele is also transcribed in osteoblasts of mandibular bone, again starting precisely with the onset of osteogenesis (day E13/14). No other cells were seen to transcribe the mutant gene. By these criteria, transcription of the Mov13 allele constitutes a true differentiation marker for odontoblasts and osteoblasts. Expression of the mutant allele in these two specialized cell types, in contrast to its transcriptional block in all other mesodermal cells ('fibroblasts'), suggests tissue-specific differences in the regulation of the alpha 1(I) collagen gene.","['Schwarz, M', 'Harbers, K', 'Kratochwil, K']","['Schwarz M', 'Harbers K', 'Kratochwil K']","['Institute of Molecular Biology, Austrian Academy of Sciences, Salzburg.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Development,"Development (Cambridge, England)",8701744,"['0 (Genetic Markers)', '0 (RNA Probes)', '9007-34-5 (Collagen)']",IM,"['Alleles', 'Animals', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Collagen/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Genetic Markers', 'Mandible/cytology/embryology', 'Mice', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/genetics', 'Mutation', 'Nucleic Acid Hybridization', 'Odontoblasts/*cytology', 'Osteoblasts/*cytology', 'Proviruses/genetics', 'RNA Probes', 'Restriction Mapping', 'Tooth/cytology/embryology', '*Transcription, Genetic']",1990/04/01 00:00,1990/04/01 00:01,['1990/04/01 00:00'],"['1990/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Development. 1990 Apr;108(4):717-26.,,,,,,,,,,

Plasmacytoid leukemia is characterized by a generalized invasion of visceral tissues and the orbit of the eye by plasmacytoid cells. The disease was experimentally transmitted to healthy chinook salmon by i.p. injection of kidney tissue homogenates, but transmission with a cell-free filtrate was equivocal. In another experiment, chinook salmon, coho salmon, O. kisutch, sockeye salmon, O. nerka, rainbow trout, O. mykiss (or Salmo gairdneri), and Atlantic salmon, Salmo salar, were given injections of a tissue homogenate from affected chinook salmon. Ten wk after exposure, plasmacytoid leukemia was observed in all of the sockeye salmon and chinook salmon, one of ten Atlantic salmon, and none of the rainbow trout. Seven of the ten coho salmon examined at 10 wk had lesions suggestive of early development or a mild form of the disease. Multifocal areas of proliferating cells resembling plasmablasts were observed in the visceral fat, and the kidneys exhibited mild to moderate hyperplasia of the hematopoietic interstitium.

Bryo induced a prompt and persistent macrophage-like differentiation, as evidenced by functional, morphological, and immunological criteria. Differentiated cells remained viable for at least 21 days with little change in cell number. CML cell cultures treated in semisolid medium with bryo showed diffuse infiltration with single macrophages, as well as discrete macrophage, mixed, and granulocytic colonies. Supernatants of suspension cultures of bryo-treated CML cells contained granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Furthermore, colony formation could be significantly inhibited by the addition of antibodies to GM-CSF. Prolonged liquid culture of CML cells in bryo reduced colony-forming unit, granulocyte-macrophage content. Bryo-induced differentiation was associated with a decrease in lactoferrin, a marker of granulocyte differentiation, and an increase in both c-fms and interleukin-1 beta RNA, both of which are expressed by monocytes/macrophages. These data demonstrate that bryostatin 1 is capable of inducing macrophage-like differentiation in maturing CML cells. Furthermore, bryostatin induces secretion of GM-CSF by such cells in suspension and semisolid medium and also promotes clonal extinction of granulocyte-macrophage progenitors.

In humans acivicin causes reversible, dose-limiting central nervous system (CNS) effects including somnolence, ataxia, personality changes, and hallucinations. We have observed and reported previously that acivicin-treated cats exhibit symptoms (ataxia, sedation, somnolence) resembling CNS toxicity reported in humans. We hypothesized that if acivicin uptake into brain were mediated by a saturable transport system common to endogenous amino acids, drug uptake and CNS toxicity might be blocked by elevation of normal amino acid concentrations in circulating plasma. To test this hypothesis, cats received constant-rate i.v. infusions of either saline or Aminosyn, 10% (a commercially available mixture of 16 amino acids not containing glutamine, glutamate, aspartate, or cysteine) for 4 h prior to and 18 h subsequent to administration of acivicin at a dose producing marked behavioral changes in control cats. Presence or absence of ataxia and sedation were noted at intervals after acivicin treatment. Results showed that Aminosyn infusion prevented CNS symptoms in six of eight cats. Subsequent experiments showed that acivicin levels in brain tissue of Aminosyn-treated cats were 13% of the drug levels in saline-infused cats. Acivicin levels in most peripheral tissues were also decreased significantly by Aminosyn infusion but not to the extent observed in brain. Decreased brain uptake was shown to be due to a combination of amino acid blockade of drug transport into that organ and of increased total body clearance of drug. Concomitant Aminosyn treatment did not alter the efficacy of acivicin in mice bearing L1210 leukemia or MX-1 human mammary carcinoma. Further studies demonstrated that a solution containing only four large neutral amino acids (leucine, isoleucine, phenylalanine, and valine) could also protect cats from acivicin-induced CNS toxicity, apparently without increasing acivicin total body clearance. However, a mixture of several other amino acids contained in Aminosyn (alanine, arginine, tyrosine, histidine, proline, serine, and glycine) failed to prevent CNS toxicity. We conclude that cotreatment with Aminosyn or a mixture of large neutral amino acids could protect cancer patients from acivicin-induced CNS toxicity without ablating antitumor efficacy.","['Williams, M G', 'Earhart, R H', 'Bailey, H', 'McGovren, J P']","['Williams MG', 'Earhart RH', 'Bailey H', 'McGovren JP']","['Cancer and Infectious Diseases Research, Upjohn Company, Kalamazoo, Michigan 49001.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Amino Acids)', '0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Electrolytes)', '0 (Isoxazoles)', '0 (Oxazoles)', '0 (Parenteral Nutrition Solutions)', '0 (Solutions)', '0 (amino-acid, glucose, and electrolyte solution)', 'IY9XDZ35W2 (Glucose)', 'O0X60K76I6 (acivicin)']",IM,"['Amino Acids/administration & dosage/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Animals', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/*toxicity', 'Breast Neoplasms/drug therapy', 'Cats', 'Central Nervous System/drug effects/*pathology', 'Electrolytes', 'Female', 'Glucose', 'Humans', 'Infusions, Intravenous', 'Isoxazoles/administration & dosage/therapeutic use/*toxicity', 'Leukemia L1210/drug therapy', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred Strains', 'Mice, Nude', 'Oxazoles/*toxicity', 'Parenteral Nutrition Solutions', 'Reference Values', 'Solutions', 'Transplantation, Heterologous']",1990/09/01 00:00,1990/09/01 00:01,['1990/09/01 00:00'],"['1990/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 1990 Sep 1;50(17):5475-80.,,,,,,,,,,

The specific drug combination and experimental growth system for this introductory application was that of 1-beta-D-arabinofuranosylcytosine (ara-C) and cisplatin with simultaneous drug exposure (1, 3, 6, 12, or 48 h) against L1210 leukemia in vitro. To quantitate the type and degree of drug interaction, a model was fitted using nonlinear regression to the data from each separate experiment, and parameters were estimated (K. C. Syracuse and W. R. Greco, Proc. Biopharm. Sect. Am. Stat. Assoc., 127-132, 1986). The parameters included the maximum cell density over background in absence of drug, the background cell density in presence of infinite drug, the 50% inhibitory concentrations and concentration-effect slopes for each drug, and a synergism-antagonism parameter, alpha. A positive alpha indicates synergism, a negative alpha, antagonism, and a zero alpha, additivity. Maximal synergy was found with a 3-h exposure of ara-C + cisplatin, with alpha = 3.08 +/- 0.96 (SE) and 2.44 +/- 0.70 in two separate experiments. Four different graphic representations of the raw data and fitted curves provide visual indications of goodness of fit of the estimated dose-response surface to the data and visual indications of the intensity of drug interaction. The universal response surface approach is mathematically consistent with the traditional isobologram approach but is more objective, is more quantitative, and is more easily automated. Although specifically developed for in vitro cancer chemotherapy applications, the universal response surface approach should prove to be useful in the fields of pharmacology, toxicology, epidemiology, and biomedical science in general.","['Greco, W R', 'Park, H S', 'Rustum, Y M']","['Greco WR', 'Park HS', 'Rustum YM']","['Grace Cancer Drug Center, Roswell Park Memorial Institute, New York State Department of Health, Buffalo 14263.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', 'Q20Q21Q62J (Cisplatin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cisplatin/*pharmacology', 'Cytarabine/*pharmacology', 'Drug Synergism', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia L1210', 'Mathematics', 'Mice', 'Models, Theoretical', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/cytology/*drug effects']",1990/09/01 00:00,1990/09/01 00:01,['1990/09/01 00:00'],"['1990/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 1990 Sep 1;50(17):5318-27.,"['CA184202/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA46732/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA50456/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,"['Cancer Res. 1992 Aug 15;52(16):4558-60; author reply 4561-5.

We report Ki values for the inhibition of L1210 thymidylate synthase (TS) of 2 and 0.027 microM for 2-desamino-5,8-dideazafolate and desamino-CB3717, respectively, indicating a 30- and 10-fold loss in TS-inhibitory activity compared with the corresponding 2-NH2 compounds. The synthetic tri- and tetrapolyglutamate derivatives of desamino-CB3717 were 66- and 101-fold more potent than the monoglutamate form as inhibitors of TS. Both desamino compounds were more potent as inhibitors of L1210 and W1L2 cell growth than were their 2-amino counterparts. 2-Desamino-5,8-dideazafolate retains quite good activity against both the TS-overproducing W1L2:C1 line and the L1210 cell line grown in the presence of thymidine, suggesting that a secondary locus of action may be involved. This other target is a folate-dependent enzyme as evidenced by the protection of the inhibition of cell growth by the addition of hypoxanthine or folinic acid together with thymidine. The methotrexate-resistant, dihydrofolate reductase-overproducing L1210:R7A cell line is cross-resistant to 2-desamino-5,8-dideazafolate, which suggests that dihydrofolate reductase is the other target. An L1210 subline (1565) unable to transport reduced folates is 10-fold resistant to desamino-CB3717 and 2-desamino-5,8-dideazafolate but is not cross-resistant to CB3717 or 5,8-dideazafolate. The removal of the 2-amino function of CB3717 did not affect folylpolyglutamate synthetase substrate activity (CB3717 Km = 48 microM, desamino-CB3717 Km = 40 microM). However, both 5,8-dideazafolate and its desamino analogue were about 10-fold better substrates for folylpolyglutamate synthase than were the N10-propargyl compounds, and this may contribute to their good growth-inhibitory properties. In vivo, desamino-CB3717 cured approximately 75% of mice bearing the L1210:ICR tumor at doses of 50 mg/kg daily for 5 days and above (maximum tolerated dose greater than 1000 mg/kg daily for 5 days).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)","['Jackman, A L', 'Taylor, G A', ""O'Connor, B M"", 'Bishop, J A', 'Moran, R G', 'Calvert, A H']","['Jackman AL', 'Taylor GA', ""O'Connor BM"", 'Bishop JA', 'Moran RG', 'Calvert AH']","['Drug Development Section, Institute of Cancer Research, Sutton, Surrey, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '935E97BOY8 (Folic Acid)', 'EC 2.1.1.45 (Thymidylate Synthase)', 'N8VP1Y24AU (ICI 198583)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Drug Resistance', 'Folic Acid/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia L1210/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred DBA', 'Mice, Inbred Strains', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Thymidylate Synthase/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/*cytology/drug effects']",1990/09/01 00:00,1990/09/01 00:01,['1990/09/01 00:00'],"['1990/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 1990 Sep 1;50(17):5212-8.,,,,,,,,,,

Frequency and long-term sequelae in patients receiving high-dose chemotherapy and marrow transplantation.,900-8,"One hundred sixty-eight bone marrow transplant recipients and 49 patients who received high-dose chemotherapy were evaluated for symptomatic thrombosis after Hickman catheter placement. The timing of thrombotic complications was different between these two groups, with the transplant group having a significantly lower thrombus-free survival by 28 days after catheter placement. By 100 days after placement the thrombus-free survival rates of the two groups were similar. The platelet count at time of catheter placement was significantly lower in the nontransplant group, and the thrombus-free survival was longer in patients whose catheter was placed when their platelet count was less than 150,000, suggesting that thrombocytopenia delays thrombotic complications. Placement of two Hickman catheters resulted in a 12.9% thrombosis rate (21 of 162 patients) and was significantly more likely to be associated with thrombosis than placement of one catheter. Long-term follow-up evaluation of patients treated without successful fibrinolytic therapy showed no residual symptoms of venous obstruction. In those patients presenting with concomitant catheter obstruction resulting from thrombosis, low-dose fibrinolytic therapy was successful in restoring catheter function 70% of the time. Placement of two Hickman catheters is associated with an inordinate incidence of thrombosis. Thrombocytopenia at the time of catheter placement may delay this complication. Thrombotic catheter obstruction can be treated successfully with low-dose fibrinolytic therapy. Even without fibrinolytic therapy, catheter-induced subclavian vein thrombosis rarely causes long-term disability.","['Haire, W D', 'Lieberman, R P', 'Edney, J', 'Vaughan, W P', 'Kessinger, A', 'Armitage, J O', 'Goldsmith, J C']","['Haire WD', 'Lieberman RP', 'Edney J', 'Vaughan WP', 'Kessinger A', 'Armitage JO', 'Goldsmith JC']","['Department of Internal Medicine, University of Nebraska Medical Center, Omaha 68198-3330.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,,IM,"['Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Catheterization, Central Venous/*adverse effects/methods', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/surgery', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Platelet Count', '*Pulmonary Veins', 'Radiography', 'Regression Analysis', 'Risk Factors', 'Survival Rate', 'Thrombolytic Therapy', 'Thrombosis/blood/diagnostic imaging/*etiology/mortality/therapy', 'Time Factors']",1990/09/01 00:00,1990/09/01 00:01,['1990/09/01 00:00'],"['1990/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer. 1990 Sep 1;66(5):900-8. doi: 10.1002/1097-0142(19900901)66:5<900::aid-cncr2820660515>3.0.co;2-a.,,['10.1002/1097-0142(19900901)66:5<900::aid-cncr2820660515>3.0.co;2-a [doi]'],,,,,,,,

The incidence, 10-year actuarial risk (AR), and relative risk (RR) of a second malignancy developing were calculated for the 407 patients who were treated with surgery alone, 226 who were treated with surgery followed by adjuvant chemotherapy (CT), 140 who were treated with surgery plus adjuvant radiation therapy (RT), and 308 who received all three modalities (CRT). The AR of a subsequent cancer (8.4% for CRT, 8.7% for CT, 8.7% for RT, and 11.7% for surgery only patients) did not differ significantly between treatment groups. The overall second cancer RR was 1.0% after CRT (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.4 to 2.0), 1.3% after RT (95% CI, 0.6 to 2.5), 1.6% after CT (95% CI, 0.9 to 2.6), and 1.7% after surgery alone (95% CI, 1.2 to 2.4). Contralateral breast cancers (RR of 4.2%; 95% CI, 2.7 to 6.3) account for the statistically significant excess of second malignancies among the surgery alone patients. The AR for contralateral breast cancer in the surgery group was higher than in either group receiving CT (P less than 0.01), but was not significantly different from the RT group. The RR for solid tumors other than breast cancer was not significantly different from unity in any of the treatment groups. The RR for acute leukemia was 16.7% in the CRT group (95% CI, 0.2 to 92.7), 11.1% in the CT group (95% CI, 0.1 to 61.8), 10.0% in the surgery alone group (95% CI, 1.1 to 36.1), and 0.0% in the RT group (95% CI, 0.0 to 61.1). This study indicated that inclusion of RT and/or CT in the initial treatment of breast cancer did not impact negatively on patients' overall risk for a subsequent malignancy during the first decade after therapy, and that adjuvant CT with or without RT may decrease their risk of a contralateral breast cancer.","['Lavey, R S', 'Eby, N L', 'Prosnitz, L R']","['Lavey RS', 'Eby NL', 'Prosnitz LR']","['Department of Radiation Oncology, University of California Los Angeles.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,,IM,"['Actuarial Analysis', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*adverse effects', 'Breast Neoplasms/etiology/surgery/*therapy', 'Combined Modality Therapy/adverse effects', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Neoplasm Invasiveness', 'Neoplasms, Multiple Primary/chemically induced/epidemiology/*etiology', 'Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced/*etiology', 'Postoperative Complications/*etiology', 'Radiotherapy/*adverse effects', 'Remission Induction']",1990/09/01 00:00,1990/09/01 00:01,['1990/09/01 00:00'],"['1990/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer. 1990 Sep 1;66(5):874-81. doi: 10.1002/1097-0142(19900901)66:5<874::aid-cncr2820660511>3.0.co;2-6.,,['10.1002/1097-0142(19900901)66:5<874::aid-cncr2820660511>3.0.co;2-6 [doi]'],,,,,,,,

PMA stimulation of B-cells induced morphological changes as well as CD5, CD11c, B-ly 7 and TRAP positivity. The cells formed small aggregates, the cell membranes were ruffled and frequently hairy and a small number of cells became plastic adherent and developed dendritic structure. CD5 and CD11c appeared on day 2, imitating a B-CLL phenotype. On day 3 and 4 a decrease of CD5, an increase of CD11c and the appearance of B-ly 7 could be seen mimicking an HCL phenotype. The changes in B-CLL and HCL upon PMA stimulation were mainly morphological: the B-CLL cells became ruffled and aggregated strongly, while the HCL cells developed dendritic features and became adherent. The immunophenotype of the PMA stimulated HCL cells did not change. The B-CLL cells remained CD5 positive and did not become B-ly 7 positive. The findings indicate that although PMA stimulation of normal peripheral blood cells results in CLL- as well as HCL-like phenotypes, similar stimulation of B-CLL cells does not result in an HCL-like phenotype.","['Visser, L', 'Poppema, S']","['Visser L', 'Poppema S']","['Department of Laboratory Medicine, Cross Cancer Institute, Edmonton, Alberta, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,['NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)'],IM,"['B-Lymphocytes/*drug effects/immunology', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Hairy Cell/immunology/*pathology', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*blood/immunology', 'Phenotype', 'Spleen/pathology', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/*pharmacology']",1990/07/01 00:00,1990/07/01 00:01,['1990/07/01 00:00'],"['1990/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 1990 Jul;75(3):359-65. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.1990.tb04349.x.,,['10.1111/j.1365-2141.1990.tb04349.x [doi]'],,,,,,['Br J Haematol. 1991 May;78(1):139-40.

Fifteen patients had de novo EL, five patients had therapy-related EL. Myelodysplasia preceded the onset of EL in eight cases and myelodysplastic features involving multiple haemopoietic lineages were observed at leukaemia presentation in all cases. Immunologic findings confirmed multilineage involvement, showing sub-population of cells expressing platelet-associated markers in more than 50% of cases tested and the presence of a myelomonocytic component, besides glycophorin A-positive cells. Cytogenetically, major karyotype aberrations (MAKA), defined by the presence of three or more aberrant events in the same clone, were observed in 14 cases, minor karyotype aberrations (MIKA) were observed in four cases and normal karyotype in two cases. No differences in the cytological-cytogenetic picture of our patients with de novo EL, and with therapy-related EL were found suggesting that aetiological factors and/or pathogenetic mechanisms common to EL and secondary leukaemia may exist. All patients with MAKA had leftward shift of erythropoiesis with proerythroblasts and basophilic erythroblasts usually representing more than 50% of all erythroid cells. In patients with MIKA or normal karyotype, maturatio of erythroid cells, though morphologically abnormal, was quantitatively preserved and early erythroblasts never exceeded 25% of erythroid cells. Clinically, the haemoglobin level at presentation, as well as in the proportion of patients achieving complete remission after chemotherapy, appeared to be lower in the maturation arrest-MAKA group as compared to the preserved maturation-MIKA/normal karyotype group. Median survival was shorter in the former group (3.5 months) than in the latter (median 13 months). Morphologic-immunologic-cytogenetic studies thus allow for the identification of two distinct cytogenetic-clinicopathological types of EL.","['Cuneo, A', 'Van Orshoven, A', 'Michaux, J L', 'Boogaerts, M', 'Louwagie, A', 'Doyen, C', 'Dal Cin, P', 'Fagioli, F', 'Castoldi, G', 'Van den Berghe, H']","['Cuneo A', 'Van Orshoven A', 'Michaux JL', 'Boogaerts M', 'Louwagie A', 'Doyen C', 'Dal Cin P', 'Fagioli F', 'Castoldi G', 'Van den Berghe H']","['Centre for Human Genetics, University of Leuven, Belgium.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Erythroblasts/pathology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/genetics/immunology/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Retrospective Studies']",1990/07/01 00:00,1990/07/01 00:01,['1990/07/01 00:00'],"['1990/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 1990 Jul;75(3):346-54. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.1990.tb04347.x.,,['10.1111/j.1365-2141.1990.tb04347.x [doi]'],,,,,,,,

Sixty-nine quinoline 4-carboxylic acid analogs were analyzed as inhibitors of L1210 dihydroorotate dehydrogenase. This structure-activity relationship study identified three critical regions of brequinar sodium and its analogs, where specific substitutions are required for the inhibition of the activity of dihydroorotate dehydrogenase. The three principal regions are: (i) the C(2) position where bulky hydrophobic substituents are necessary, (ii) the C(4) position which has a strict requirement for the carboxylic acid and its corresponding salts, and (iii) the benzo portion of the quinoline ring with appropriate substitutions. These results will be useful in the elucidation of the precise nature of the interaction between brequinar sodium and dihydroorotate dehydrogenase.","['Chen, S F', 'Papp, L M', 'Ardecky, R J', 'Rao, G V', 'Hesson, D P', 'Forbes, M', 'Dexter, D L']","['Chen SF', 'Papp LM', 'Ardecky RJ', 'Rao GV', 'Hesson DP', 'Forbes M', 'Dexter DL']","['Cancer Chemotherapy Research Program, E.I.

A lower risk than expected--after both in situ and invasive carcinoma of the uterine cervix--is observed for breast cancer, cancer of the corpus uteri and for multiple myeloma.

To elucidate the mechanism of the PHG, we investigated whether hairy cells produce interleukin 6 (IL-6) and express IL-6 receptor. The culture supernatant of these hairy cells increased 3H-thymidine uptake of a IL-6 dependent hybridoma clone (MH60) in a dose-dependent manner. These cells were stained with anti-IL-6 antibody using immuno-cytochemical technique. Our results suggested that these hairy cells produce and secrete IL-6. Immunocytochemical staining with anti IL-6 receptor antibody and the binding assay with 125I-labelled recombinant IL-6 revealed that these cells express little or no receptors for IL-6. It was therefore suggested that IL-6 produced by hairy cells in this case is not an autocrine growth factor for these cells but may play a role in development of PHG by stimulating normal B lymphocytes to produce an excessive amount of immunoglobulin.","['Shiota, M', 'Kawanishi, Y', 'Nakano, M', 'Ohdo, T', 'Toyama, K']","['Shiota M', 'Kawanishi Y', 'Nakano M', 'Ohdo T', 'Toyama K']","['First Department of Internal Medicine, Tokyo Medical College.']",['jpn'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Japan,Nihon Ketsueki Gakkai Zasshi,Nihon Ketsueki Gakkai zasshi : journal of Japan Haematological Society,2984803R,"['0 (Immunoglobulin G)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Receptors, Immunologic)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-6)']",IM,"['B-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Hypergammaglobulinemia/*etiology', '*Immunoglobulin G', 'Interleukin-6/analysis/*biosynthesis/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Hairy Cell/blood/complications/*metabolism', 'Middle Aged', 'Receptors, Immunologic/analysis', 'Receptors, Interleukin-6']",1990/05/01 00:00,1990/05/01 00:01,['1990/05/01 00:00'],"['1990/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Nihon Ketsueki Gakkai Zasshi. 1990 May;53(3):582-8.,,,,,,,,,,

Preconditioning of the tumour cells with either IL-1 alpha or TNF alpha did not affect cytostasis by subsequent culture of tumor cells in presence of either one of the cytokines.

In this study we attempted to prolong the retention of the radioiodine in marrow through the use of propylthiouracil (PTU). When administered to normal dogs, PTU pretreatment resulted in improved marrow localization of 131I-labeled DM-5. There was no appreciable loss of activity from the marrow during the 2-4 hr postinjection time interval; a finding in contrast to the control animals where marrow activity declined a mean 45 +/- 0.5% over the same time period. Additionally, in contrast to controls, a rise in plasma trichloroacetic acid (TCA) nonprecipitable activity was not demonstrated in the PTU treated group during this 2-4 hr period.

However, no conclusive explanation has yet been provided for this property. We now present some data indicating that the cholesterol concentration in the incubation medium modulates EL toxicity against the HL60 leukemic cell line in vitro. Furthermore, model membranes richer in cholesterol take up EL more slowly, and cell cholesterol enrichment of HL60 cells counteracts EL biophysical membrane interaction, but not toxicity, in our experimental model. However, the K562 cell line, a leukemia line less sensitive to EL toxic action, has higher levels of cell cholesterol. Our data provide evidence to explain differences in sensitivity to EL among different cell types and contribute to the understanding of the mechanism of action of EL.","['Diomede, L', 'Bizzi, A', 'Magistrelli, A', 'Modest, E J', 'Salmona, M', 'Noseda, A']","['Diomede L', 'Bizzi A', 'Magistrelli A', 'Modest EJ', 'Salmona M', 'Noseda A']","['Istituto di Ricerche Farmacologiche Mario Negri, Milan, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Glyceryl Ethers)', '0 (Phosphatidic Acids)', '97C5T2UQ7J (Cholesterol)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacokinetics/toxicity', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Membrane/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Cholesterol/*metabolism', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Interactions', 'Glyceryl Ethers/*pharmacokinetics/toxicity', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/metabolism', 'Membrane Fluidity/drug effects', 'Phosphatidic Acids/*pharmacokinetics/toxicity', 'Time Factors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects/metabolism']",1990/08/15 00:00,1990/08/15 00:01,['1990/08/15 00:00'],"['1990/08/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/08/15 00:01 [medline]', '1990/08/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Int J Cancer. 1990 Aug 15;46(2):341-6. doi: 10.1002/ijc.2910460234.,,['10.1002/ijc.2910460234 [doi]'],,,,,,,,

One successful strategy has been to use heteroconjugates or bispecific monoclonal antibodies reacting with T cell molecules with activating properties (e.g., mab directed to CD3/TCR) and target cell surface antigens. In this report we show that Staphylococcal enterotoxins (SE) direct human T lymphocytes to execute cytotoxicity toward MHC class II-expressing Raji cells, but not against MHC class II-deficient Raji mutant RJ 2.2.5. Both HLA-DR+ and HLA-DR- effector T lymphocytes are effective in the killing of Raji cells coated with SE. The Staphylococcal enterotoxin-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (SDCC) is a rapid T lymphocyte-mediated cytolytic mechanism killing the targets within an hour of incubation. HLA-DR+ target cells are sensitized to be killed within minutes of incubation with picomolar concentrations of SE. SE-sensitized Raji cells remain targets for SDCC after overnight culture at 37 degrees C, demonstrating that the sensitive state is relatively stable. SEA- and SEB-selective cytolytic T cell lines were established to illustrate the clonal variability of SDCC effectors with respect to SE specificity. We also demonstrate that autologous monocytes and activated T lymphocytes as well as B lymphocytes and freshly prepared HLA-DR+ leukemic cells are excellent targets in SDCC.","['Hedlund, G', 'Dohlsten, M', 'Lando, P A', 'Kalland, T']","['Hedlund G', 'Dohlsten M', 'Lando PA', 'Kalland T']","['Pharmacia Leo Therapeutics AB, Ideon, Malmo, Sweden.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Netherlands,Cell Immunol,Cellular immunology,1246405,"['0 (Enterotoxins)', '0 (HLA-DR Antigens)', '37337-57-8 (enterotoxin A, Staphylococcal)', '39424-53-8 (enterotoxin B, staphylococcal)']",IM,"['B-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Child', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic/immunology', 'Enterotoxins/*immunology', 'HLA-DR Antigens/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/immunology', 'Lymphoma/immunology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/*immunology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1990/09/01 00:00,1990/09/01 00:01,['1990/09/01 00:00'],"['1990/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cell Immunol. 1990 Sep;129(2):426-34. doi: 10.1016/0008-8749(90)90218-g.,,"['0008-8749(90)90218-G [pii]', '10.1016/0008-8749(90)90218-g [doi]']",,,,,,,,

The T cell help was mediated by soluble factors, as indicated in experiments showing that cell-free conditioned medium from T lymphocytes activated by HTLV-I was able to induce B cell proliferation and differentiation. Furthermore, a direct effect of HTLV-I on B cell proliferation was demonstrated when viral particles were added to purified B cells together with suboptimal doses of Staphylococcus aureus Cowan strain I (SAC). These observations show that an immediate early effect of HTLV-I infection was exerted on B cells, mainly in a T cell-dependent manner.

Flow cytometric analysis demonstrated the expression of the IL-2R beta chain on granular lymphocytes (GLs) from all eight patients with granular lymphocyte proliferative disorders (GLPDs), on adult T-cell leukemia (ATL) cells from all three patients with ATL, and on T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) cells from one of three patients with T-ALL. Although GLs from all the GLPD patients expressed the IL-2R beta chain alone and not the IL-2R alpha chain (Tac-antigen: p55), ATL and T-ALL cells expressing the beta chain coexpressed the alpha chain. In two of seven patients with common ALL (cALL) and in both patients with B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia, the leukemic cells expressed the alpha chain alone. Neither the alpha chain nor the beta chain was expressed on leukemic cells from the remaining 28 patients, including all 18 patients with acute nonlymphocytic leukemia, five of seven patients with cALL, all three patients with multiple myeloma, and two of three patients with T-ALL. These results indicate that three different forms of IL-2R chain expression exist on leukemic cells: the alpha chain alone; the beta chain alone; and both the alpha and beta chains. To examine whether the results obtained by flow cytometric analysis actually reflect functional aspects of the expressed IL-2Rs, we studied the specific binding of 125I-labeled IL-2 (125I-IL-2) to leukemic cells in 18 of the 44 patients.

Since tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF alpha) shares many of the biologic properties of IL-1, we have compared the protective effects of TNF alpha with IL-1 against 4-HC. Incubation of human bone marrow mononuclear cells or an enriched progenitor population for 20 hours with either TNF alpha or IL-1 resulted in the survival of an increased number of single- and mixed-lineage colonies, including replatable blast cell colonies, while only rare colonies were seen in the control group. Antibodies to TNF alpha completely abolished the protection observed with IL-1, while antibodies to IL-1 alpha and IL-1 beta decreased but did not abolish the protection seen with TNF alpha. Combinations of low doses of TNF alpha and IL-1 showed synergy in their protective effects. Furthermore, no protection was observed by IL-1, IL-1 bone-marrow-conditioned medium (IL-1-BMCM), or TNF alpha for HL-60, K562, KG1, KG1a, and DU.528 leukemic-cell lines or primary acute myelogenous leukemic (AML) blast cells from the lethal effects of 4-HC. In the case of HL-60 and KG1a cell lines, TNF alpha preincubation resulted in increased cytotoxicity. Furthermore, preincubation of a mixture of AML cells and normal bone-marrow cells with IL-1 + TNF alpha before 4-HC resulted in the protection of normal but not leukemic progenitors. These results suggest that TNF alpha is necessary for the protection of normal, early, human hematopoietic progenitors from 4-HC, while IL-1 is not mandatory but will synergize with TNF alpha to offer increased protection. In addition, no protection from 4-HC is observed by TNF alpha, IL-1, or IL-1-BMCM for primary leukemic blast cells or leukemic cell lines.","['Moreb, J', 'Zucali, J R', 'Rueth, S']","['Moreb J', 'Zucali JR', 'Rueth S']","['Department of Medicine, University of Florida, Gainesville.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Interleukin-1)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'U880A4FUDA (perfosfamide)']",IM,"['Cell Line', 'Cyclophosphamide/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-1/pharmacology/physiology', 'Leukemia/blood', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/*pharmacology/physiology']",1990/08/15 00:00,1990/08/15 00:01,['1990/08/15 00:00'],"['1990/08/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/08/15 00:01 [medline]', '1990/08/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 1990 Aug 15;76(4):681-9.,['AI 24709/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States'],['S0006-4971(20)82442-2 [pii]'],,,,,,,,

By differential screening of a cDNA library derived from cells treated with phorbol ester we have isolated and characterised a set of early response genes (ERGs) displaying rapid transient up-regulation of expression in response to PMA. Cross-hybridisation studies showed that PMA probably induces the expression of over one hundred distinct genes, implying an ERG complexity comparable to that activated by mitogenic stimulation of fibroblasts and normal T lymphocytes. Of 13 genes analysed in detail, most were induced by PMA without a requirement for de novo protein synthesis, whilst nuclear run-on analysis showed that at least some of the more abundant classes of ERG were up-regulated through transcriptional mechanisms. In a proliferating variant B-CLL population, few differences in ERG expression were seen, suggesting that these genes are part of a gene regulatory pathway coupled to the differentiative rather than the proliferative response of B-CLL cells. However, studies in a range of cell types revealed a surprisingly diverse pattern of PMA-induced expression where most ERGs were relatively B-CLL-specific. This implies an extreme diversity of gene regulatory pathways activated in the primary response by phorbol ester generally and suggests that the onset of PMA-induced plasmacytoid differentiation of B-CLL cells is preceded by activation of a complex gene regulatory program that is largely unique to this maturation-arrested B cell.","['Murphy, J J', 'Norton, J D']","['Murphy JJ', 'Norton JD']","['Department of Haematology, Royal Free Hospital School of Medicine, London, U.K.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Biochim Biophys Acta,Biochimica et biophysica acta,0217513,['NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)'],IM,"['B-Lymphocytes/metabolism/*pathology', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cloning, Molecular', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/blood/*genetics', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Plasma Cells/metabolism/*pathology', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Up-Regulation/genetics']",1990/07/30 00:00,1990/07/30 00:01,['1990/07/30 00:00'],"['1990/07/30 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/07/30 00:01 [medline]', '1990/07/30 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Biochim Biophys Acta. 1990 Jul 30;1049(3):261-71. doi: 10.1016/0167-4781(90)90096-k.,,"['0167-4781(90)90096-K [pii]', '10.1016/0167-4781(90)90096-k [doi]']",,,,,,,,

We tested tamoxifen's ability to augment the antitumor activity of interleukin-2 (IL-2), a lymphokine capable of expanding and activating lymphocytes, in the treatment of established pulmonary metastases of the weakly immunogenic murine fibrosarcoma MCA-106. Age-matched C57BL/6 female mice bearing pulmonary metastases induced by a tail vein injection of MCA-106 tumor suspension (5 x 10(5) cells/mouse) were treated from days 3 through 12 with intraperitoneal saline solution or IL-2 (50,000 units twice a day). Half of the mice in each group received plain and the remainder received tamoxifen-treated (2 units/ml) drinking water ad libitum for the duration of the experiment. All mice were killed on day 18 for enumeration of pulmonary metastases. Compared with saline-treated control mice, IL-2 and tamoxifen reduced metastases by 66% (p less than 0.0002) and 30% (p less than 0.005), respectively. IL-2 and tamoxifen combined reduced metastases 95% (p less than 0.0002), significantly better than did IL-2 (p less than 0.02) or tamoxifen (p less than 0.0003) alone. In vitro, tamoxifen inhibited proliferation of the weakly estrogen receptor-positive MCA-106 tumor by approximately 30%. Tamoxifen had no effect on the generation of 3-day IL-2-activated lymphocyte cytotoxicity against both natural killer-sensitive (YAC) and natural killer-resistant (MCA-106) target cells. Both YAC and MCA-106 tumor became more resistant to lysis with increased concentration of tamoxifen. This is the first demonstration of in vivo potentiation of IL-2 antitumor activity by tamoxifen and suggests its possible use clinically.","['Kim, B', 'Warnaka, P', 'Konrad, C']","['Kim B', 'Warnaka P', 'Konrad C']","['Department of Surgery, University of Utah Medical Center, Salt Lake City.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Surgery,Surgery,0417347,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '094ZI81Y45 (Tamoxifen)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Drug Synergism', 'Female', 'Fibrosarcoma/pathology/prevention & control/secondary', 'Interleukin-2/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Experimental/pathology', 'Lung Neoplasms/pathology/prevention & control/secondary', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Spleen/cytology/drug effects', 'Tamoxifen/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/transplantation']",1990/08/01 00:00,1990/08/01 00:01,['1990/08/01 00:00'],"['1990/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Surgery. 1990 Aug;108(2):139-44; discussion 144-5.,['P30CA43703/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,

We found that thrombospondin synthesis and platelet factor (PF)-4 gene expression were specific for mature megakaryoblasts, whereas collagen unresponsiveness and prostaglandin E1-induced Ca2+ mobilization were noted in immature megakaryoblasts alone. This experiment shows that functional and genetic analysis are useful for characterizing the leukemic megakaryoblastic cells. We analyzed the clinical, hematologic and genetic features of 4 patients with M7, and acute megakaryoblastic transformation of CML, MDS and essential thrombocythemia. In two patients, prednisolone and 6-MP were effective in cytoreduction. In 3 patients with increased platelet counts, normal CFU-Meg formation, the megakaryoblasts with platelet production, or the coexistence of immature megakaryoblasts with mature megakaryocytes were observed, thus indicating that some megakaryoblastic leukemia cells still have the capacity of differentiation.

With extended follow-up and a larger patient population, we have further evaluated the biologic and clinical aspects of pre-B leukemia. Of 686 cases of ALL with adequate immunophenotyping, 150 were classified as pre-B cell. Seventy-seven (69%) of the 112 pre-B cases with fully banded karyotypes had a translocation. The t(1;19) accounted for 28 (25%) of these pre-B cases and 31 (6.5%) of all 480 consecutively banded ALL cases. Three (2.6%) of the pre-B cases had a novel dicentric (7;9)(p1?3;p11) translocation. A t(9;22)(q34;q11) and a t(4;11)(q21;q23) were observed in seven (6%) and three (2.6%) of the cases, respectively. Within the pre-B subgroup, comparison of t(1;19) cases (n = 28) with those having other translocations (n = 49) or no identifiable translocations (n = 35) indicated that higher leukocyte counts (P = .002), absence of DNA indexes greater than 1.16 (P = .02), higher serum lactate dehydrogenase levels (P less than .0001), and a higher frequency of nonwhite race (P = .006) were significantly related to the t(1;19). Both the t(1;19) and other chromosomal translocations were associated with an adverse prognosis in the subset of patients treated from 1979 to 1984 (Total Therapy study X). In a more recent and more intensive chemotherapy program (Total Therapy study XI), neither the t(1;19) nor other chromosomal translocations has conferred an inferior outcome, suggesting that effective treatment can offset the negative impact of chromosomal rearrangements in cases of childhood pre-B ALL.","['Raimondi, S C', 'Behm, F G', 'Roberson, P K', 'Williams, D L', 'Pui, C H', 'Crist, W M', 'Look, A T', 'Rivera, G K']","['Raimondi SC', 'Behm FG', 'Roberson PK', 'Williams DL', 'Pui CH', 'Crist WM', 'Look AT', 'Rivera GK']","[""Department of Pathology, St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN 38105.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,,IM,"['Child', 'Child, Preschool', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 1', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 19', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Karyotyping', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics/mortality', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics/mortality', 'Prognosis', 'Survival Rate', '*Translocation, Genetic']",1990/08/01 00:00,1990/08/01 00:01,['1990/08/01 00:00'],"['1990/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 1990 Aug;8(8):1380-8. doi: 10.1200/JCO.1990.8.8.1380.,"['CA-20180/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-21765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",['10.1200/JCO.1990.8.8.1380 [doi]'],,,,,,,,

Leukocytes from 36 patients with tumors (chronic myelogenic leukemia, hairy cell leukemia, and malignant melanoma) were monitored for their Mx-homolog content before, during, and after rIFN-alpha-2b therapy. Before therapy, only one patient was slightly positive for Mx-homolog. All 36 patients showed a significant increase of Mx-homolog in their mononuclear cells within the first day of IFN therapy. During therapy, the Mx-homolog levels remained elevated. After cessation of treatment, the Mx-homolog content in the mononuclear cells decreased slowly; within 2 weeks, it was about 20-30% of its value during therapy. However, even after 3 weeks, the Mx-homolog was still detectable. The maximally induced Mx-homolog concentration showed a significant correlation to the IFN dose given in vivo. These data indicate that the Mx-homolog is an excellent marker for monitoring the activity of IFN during IFN therapy.

Thus, when the appropriate amount of DF was injected into rats bearing MIA C51 cells, the development of chloroleukemia was aborted. In the present study, we provide evidence that stimulation of endogenous differentiation activity (DA) production by the administration of a biologic response modifier (Imuvert) will like-wise abort the development of chloroleukemia. Imuvert at 50 micrograms/ml had no direct effect on growth, viability, or differentiation of MIA C51 cells. However, when monocytes from young rats or adult rats were stimulated with Imuvert in vivo or in vitro, there was significant increase in DA production. Treatment of young rats with Imuvert aborted the development of chloroleukemia from transplanted MIA C51 cells.

Because embryonic cells are growth factor responsive and maintain high proliferative rates, we examined the requirement for growth factor-initiated proliferation for NK susceptibility. Murine embryonic fibroblasts made quiescent in defined medium lacking growth factors were relatively resistant to NK cytolysis. However, reinitiation of proliferation with basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) or epidermal growth factor enhanced lysis in a dose-dependent fashion. TGF-beta, which blocked cell division, did not enhance cytotoxicity. Additionally, growth inhibition by prolonged incubation at confluence suppressed lysis. The enhanced NK cytotoxicity of bFGF-stimulated fibroblasts was caused by a post-binding event because no difference in cold target inhibition could be demonstrated with bFGF-treated cells. NK cytotoxicity has largely been attributed to the action of cytotoxins released from cytoplasmic granules. In a 51Cr release assay, bFGF-treated fibroblasts were insensitive to NK granules isolated from the RNK large granular lymphocyte leukemia. However, these same cells exhibited marked sensitivity to lysis in an 18-h adhesion assay normally utilized to detect TNF-alpha. With the use of this assay, a dose-dependent increase in sensitivity of bFGF-treated fibroblasts was observed, whereas quiescent fibroblasts were resistant to the action of isolated NK granules. Granule cytotoxicity was not caused by cytolysin/perforin because inactivation of granule hemolytic activity with CaCl2 did not affect fibroblast killing, and bFGF-treated cells were insensitive to purified cytolysin/perforin. This suggested that another granule associated cytotoxin was responsible for enhanced NK sensitivity of actively proliferating fibroblasts.","['Khalil, N', 'Battistuzzi, S C', 'Kraut, R P', 'Schwarz, L C', 'Greenberg, A H']","['Khalil N', 'Battistuzzi SC', 'Kraut RP', 'Schwarz LC', 'Greenberg AH']","['Manitoba Institute of Cell Biology, Department of Medicine, Winnipeg, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Cytotoxins)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '62031-54-3 (Fibroblast Growth Factors)', '62229-50-9 (Epidermal Growth Factor)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cytoplasmic Granules/*physiology', '*Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Cytotoxins/*physiology', 'Epidermal Growth Factor/*pharmacology', 'Fibroblast Growth Factors/*pharmacology', 'Fibroblasts', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*immunology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C3H', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/physiology']",1990/08/15 00:00,1990/08/15 00:01,['1990/08/15 00:00'],"['1990/08/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/08/15 00:01 [medline]', '1990/08/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 1990 Aug 15;145(4):1286-92.,,,,,,,,,,

In contrast to the effect it exerts on normal B cells, IL-4 does not promote DNA synthesis by B-CLL lymphocytes. Rather this interleukin inhibits the response to IL-2 in all patients' cells that responded to this interleukin. We thus examined whether IL-4 would modulate the number and/or the affinity of IL-2 receptors. A 3-day activation of cells by anti-microAb induced a few hundred high affinity IL-2 receptors (HA-IL-2R) on B-CLL cell surface, as determined by Scatchard analysis. Treatment of cells with IL-4 caused a marked decrease in the number of HA-IL-2R without interfering with the binding ability of IL-2. In contrast with this profound suppressive effect, IL-4 did not down-regulate the expression of each chain, alpha and beta (p55 and p75, respectively), of the HA-IL-2R heterodimer.

We have improved all three PCR steps: sample preparation, DNA amplification, and detection of the amplified product. Some of the improvements have been described previously, but they have never been combined into a complete PCR protocol. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were lysed directly in a buffer containing sodium dodecyl sulfate, Triton X-100, and proteinase K. This crude cell lysate was amplified in a two-step PCR, first with outer primers and then with inner primers nested within the first primers. The PCR product was visualized by agarose gel electrophoresis and ethidium bromide staining. Thus, we avoided conventional DNA extraction as well as hybridization for the detection of the PCR product. The samples were analyzed with four sets of nested primers (JA4 through JA7, JA9 through JA12, JA13 through JA16, and JA17 through JA20) designed to amplify HIV-1 gag, env gp120, env gp41, and pol sequences, respectively. We were able to amplify HIV-1 sequences in all samples from 90 HIV-1-seropositive individuals with mostly mild symptoms. Of these individuals, 24 were negative in HIV-1 isolation and 9 were selected because they were infected by African and Haitian HIV-1 strains. Eighty-five (94%) individuals were positive with at least three of four primer sets.

The purification procedure consisted of carboxymethyl-Sepharose, phosphocellulose, Sephacryl S-200, and phenyl-Sepharose chromatographies. Polyclonal antibodies were generated in guinea pigs with a titer of at least 1:6000. Immunohistochemical staining of fetal rat tibia with the antisera revealed that only the lysosomes of osteoclasts, but not osteoblasts, were stained. An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was developed with the antisera. There was no cross-reactivity with 1) partially purified acid phosphatases (ACPs) from normal human and beef spleens, 2) ACPs in extracts of human osteoblastic cells, 3) purified bovine bone matrix TrACP, or 4) commercial prostatic ACP. However, extracts of giant cell bone tumors, containing large amounts of bona fide osteoclasts, showed large amounts of cross-reactive material, which diluted in parallel with the partially purified hairy cell leukemic TrACP in the ELISA. Commercial serum band 5b TrACP also displaced in parallel with the partially purified hairy cell leukemic TrACP. Immunoblotting studies revealed that the antiserum, but not nonimmune guinea pig serum, reacted with the homogeneous hairy cell leukemia splenic band 5 TrACPs, which were recently purified by our laboratory. Preliminary application of the ELISA to sera of patients with metabolic bone diseases revealed that normal healthy individuals had measurable amounts of the immunoreactive material, and patients with Paget's disease or hyperparathyroidism, who should have high bone turnover, had elevated levels of this immunoreactive material in their sera. In contrast, the level of serum osteoclastic TrACP in a patient with an acute lymphatic leukemia was normal. In summary, 1) we have shown that hairy cell leukemia splenic TrACP shares significant immunological similarity with the osteoclastic TrACP and with the serum band 5b TrACP, and 2) the ELISA holds promise for a sensitive and specific assay for bone resorption.","['Kraenzlin, M E', 'Lau, K H', 'Liang, L', 'Freeman, T K', 'Singer, F R', 'Stepan, J', 'Baylink, D J']","['Kraenzlin ME', 'Lau KH', 'Liang L', 'Freeman TK', 'Singer FR', 'Stepan J', 'Baylink DJ']","['Department of Medicine, Loma Linda University, California.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",United States,J Clin Endocrinol Metab,The Journal of clinical endocrinology and metabolism,0375362,"['0 (Isoenzymes)', '0 (Tartrates)', 'EC 3.1.3.2 (Acid Phosphatase)']",IM,"['Acid Phosphatase/analysis/*blood/isolation & purification', 'Animals', 'Bone Neoplasms/enzymology', 'Chromatography, Affinity', 'Chromatography, Ion Exchange', 'Cross Reactions', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Histocytochemistry', 'Humans', 'Isoenzymes/analysis/blood/isolation & purification', 'Leukemia, Hairy Cell/enzymology', 'Osteoblasts/enzymology', 'Osteoclasts/*enzymology', 'Osteosarcoma/enzymology', 'Rats', 'Spleen/enzymology', 'Tartrates/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/enzymology']",1990/08/01 00:00,1990/08/01 00:01,['1990/08/01 00:00'],"['1990/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Clin Endocrinol Metab. 1990 Aug;71(2):442-51. doi: 10.1210/jcem-71-2-442.,,['10.1210/jcem-71-2-442 [doi]'],,,,,,,,

Resistant cells showed a rapid decrease of Gs alpha that is consistent with the finding that cAMP did not accumulate in these cells. Cholera toxin treatment of resistant cells had long-lasting effects (several weeks) on the level of Gs alpha in the cell membrane. The duration of Gs alpha decrease does not correspond to the probable life of catalytically active cholera toxin in the cells, and suggests a regulated process more complex than a proteolytic degradation targeted on ADP-ribosylated molecules.","['Hermouet, S', 'Milligan, G', 'Lanotte, M']","['Hermouet S', 'Milligan G', 'Lanotte M']","['INSERM U301, Hopital Saint-Louis, Paris, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,FEBS Lett,FEBS letters,0155157,"['0 (Adenylate Cyclase Toxin)', '0 (Adenylyl Cyclase Inhibitors)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Thionucleotides)', '0 (Virulence Factors, Bordetella)', ""0 (guanosine 5'-O-(1-thiotriphosphate))"", '20762-30-5 (Adenosine Diphosphate Ribose)', ""37589-80-3 (Guanosine 5'-O-(3-Thiotriphosphate))"", '86-01-1 (Guanosine Triphosphate)', '9012-63-9 (Cholera Toxin)', 'EC 2.4.2.31 (Pertussis Toxin)', 'EC 4.6.1.1 (Adenylyl Cyclases)']",IM,"['Adenosine Diphosphate Ribose/metabolism', 'Adenylate Cyclase Toxin', '*Adenylyl Cyclase Inhibitors', 'Adenylyl Cyclases/biosynthesis', 'Animals', 'Cell Communication/drug effects', 'Cholera Toxin/*pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', ""*Guanosine 5'-O-(3-Thiotriphosphate)/*analogs & derivatives"", 'Guanosine Triphosphate/analogs & derivatives/metabolism', 'Immunoblotting', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/enzymology', 'Membrane Proteins/metabolism', 'Pertussis Toxin', 'Rats', 'Thionucleotides/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/*drug effects/enzymology', 'Virulence Factors, Bordetella/pharmacology']",1990/07/16 00:00,1990/07/16 00:01,['1990/07/16 00:00'],"['1990/07/16 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/07/16 00:01 [medline]', '1990/07/16 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,FEBS Lett. 1990 Jul 16;267(2):221-5. doi: 10.1016/0014-5793(90)80929-d.,,"['0014-5793(90)80929-D [pii]', '10.1016/0014-5793(90)80929-d [doi]']",,,,,,,,

Cells grown with no added folic acid developed macrocytosis, a prolonged doubling time, a grossly increased deoxyuridine-suppressed value, and markedly reduced thymidylate synthetase activity. Cells in medium containing 50 nmol/l added folic acid became macrocytic with similar biochemical changes, but their doubling time was only marginally prolonged. In 100 nmol/l added folic acid, there was slight macrocytosis and a normal doubling time, but marked biochemical alterations were still present. The findings demonstrate that folate deficiency causes diminished thymidylate synthetase activity and macrocytosis in human myeloid cells, but that such cells may nevertheless demonstrate no prolongation of their doubling time, indicating either that their supply of thymidine triphosphate (TTP) is sufficient, or that misincorporation of deoxyuridine triphosphate (dUTP) is occurring. This suggests that the ineffectiveness of haemopoiesis in folate deficiency may result from damage to bone marrow cells in some way other than arrest in S-phase by a reduced delivery of TTP to the DNA replication fork.","['Matthews, J H', 'Shiels, S', 'Wickramasinghe, S N']","['Matthews JH', 'Shiels S', 'Wickramasinghe SN']","[""Dept. of Haematology, St Mary's Hospital Medical School, London, U.K.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Eur J Haematol,European journal of haematology,8703985,"['935E97BOY8 (Folic Acid)', 'EC 2.1.1.45 (Thymidylate Synthase)', 'W78I7AY22C (Deoxyuridine)']",IM,"['Cell Division', 'Cell Survival', 'Deoxyuridine/*pharmacology', 'Folic Acid/pharmacology/*physiology', 'Folic Acid Deficiency', 'Humans', 'Interphase', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*metabolism/pathology', 'Thymidylate Synthase/*metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1990/07/01 00:00,1990/07/01 00:01,['1990/07/01 00:00'],"['1990/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Eur J Haematol. 1990 Jul;45(1):43-7. doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0609.1990.tb00413.x.,,['10.1111/j.1600-0609.1990.tb00413.x [doi]'],,,,,,,,

At initial diagnosis the blast cell populations of patients with SML were characterized by significantly reduced cytosolic thymidine kinase activity (TK), thymidine-incorporation (dTR) and deoxyuridine incorporation (dUR) into DNA as well as reduced amounts of DNA-synthesizing S-phase-cells (%S) in the bone marrow (BM), compared to those patients with a rapidly proliferating acute myelogenous leukaemia (AML) and to healthy individuals. None of the SML-patients showed clinical symptoms such as night-sweat, weight-loss, hepato- and splenomegaly or lymphadenopathy at initial diagnosis. For characterization of SML vs AML we recommend the use of the biochemical parameter TK activity and the observed absence of the above-mentioned clinical symptoms. The transition to the rapidly proliferating type of AML can be recognized by an increase in the values of the biochemical and cytokinetic parameters.

Graft vs leukemia (GVL) effects independent of graft vs host disease were investigated in allogeneic bone marrow chimeras tolerant of host and donor alloantigens. The role of Thy1.2, L3T4 and Lyt2 T lymphocytes as effector cells of GVL were investigated in (BALB/c x C57BL/6)F1 mice inoculated with murine B-cell leukemia and subsequently conditioned with total lymphoid irradiation and cyclophosphamide (200 mg/kg). Mice were reconstituted with C57BL/6 bone marrow cells depleted of well-defined T-cell subsets or enriched for stem cells by the soybean agglutination method. Detection of residual tumor cells, an indicator for efficacy of GVL, was carried out by adoptive transfer of peripheral blood or spleen cells obtained from treated chimeras into secondary naive BALB/c recipients at different time intervals following bone marrow transplantation. Treatment of the primary marrow inoculum with monoclonal anti-Thy1.2 or anti-Lyt2 abolished the GVL effects and all secondary BALB/c recipients developed leukemia within 60 days. On the other hand, the treatment with monoclonal anti-L3T4 did not influence the effect of GVL and all treated recipients remained without leukemia. The data suggest that T cells may mediate GVL effects in the absence of graft vs host disease and in circumstances where tolerance to conventional alloantigens is elicited. Effector cells of GVL across the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) in the murine B-cell leukemia tumor model system appear to be Thy1.2+ Lyt2+ L3T4-. Induction of GVL effects by allogeneic cells tolerant of host MHC suggests that these effects may be independent of graft vs host disease.","['Weiss, L', 'Weigensberg, M', 'Morecki, S', 'Bar, S', 'Cobbold, S', 'Waldmann, H', 'Slavin, S']","['Weiss L', 'Weigensberg M', 'Morecki S', 'Bar S', 'Cobbold S', 'Waldmann H', 'Slavin S']","['Department of Bone Marrow Transplantation and Cancer Immunobiology Research Laboratory, Hadassah University Hospital, Jerusalem, Israel.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",Germany,Cancer Immunol Immunother,"Cancer immunology, immunotherapy : CII",8605732,"['0 (Agglutinins)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)']",IM,"['Agglutinins/pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/immunology', 'Bone Marrow Cells', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/*immunology', 'Chimera', 'Cyclophosphamide/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Immune Tolerance', 'Immunization, Passive', 'Leukemia, B-Cell/immunology/pathology/*surgery', 'Lymphatic Irradiation', 'Major Histocompatibility Complex/immunology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Phenotype', 'Spleen/cytology', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology/physiology', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",1990/01/01 00:00,1990/01/01 00:01,['1990/01/01 00:00'],"['1990/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Immunol Immunother. 1990;31(4):236-42. doi: 10.1007/BF01789175.,,['10.1007/BF01789175 [doi]'],,,,,,,,

Vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) is produced by some of these tumors, and elevated serum levels correlate with tumor cell differentiation and a favorable prognosis. It has previously been demonstrated that human neuroblastoma cell lines LA-N-5 and IMR-32 will differentiate in vitro when exposed to retinoic acid. It is now shown that VIP also induces in vitro differentiation of these neuroblastoma lines. LA-N-5 or IMR-32 cells were grown in the presence of different concentrations of VIP. Cell proliferation was suppressed, as measured by cell count, incorporation of [3H]thymidine, and measurement of the proliferation index. The degree of suppression correlated with the concentration of VIP, and the effect was indistinguishable, on a molar basis, from that seen when cells were treated with retinoic acid. Similarly, the morphological changes seen in the VIP-treated cells were the same as those seen in retinoic acid-treated ones. The effects of VIP on both cell lines, like those of retinoic acid, are reversible. The human neuroepithelioma line CHP-100, is much less sensitive to either agent. Vasoactive intestinal peptide is the first substance shown to cause differentiation of neuroblastoma cells in vitro which is also known clinically to have a specific association with that tumor. It is postulated that VIP may play a key role in the well-documented maturation of these tumors in vivo and in the normal development of the sympathetic nervous system. These findings may also have therapeutic implications for the management of this frustrating childhood malignancy.","['Pence, J C', 'Shorter, N A']","['Pence JC', 'Shorter NA']","['Department of Surgery, Duke University Medical Center, Durham, North Carolina 27710.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,['37221-79-7 (Vasoactive Intestinal Peptide)'],IM,"['Breast Neoplasms', 'Cell Differentiation/*drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute', 'Neuroblastoma', 'Neuroectodermal Tumors, Primitive, Peripheral', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/cytology/*drug effects', 'Vasoactive Intestinal Peptide/*pharmacology']",1990/08/15 00:00,1990/08/15 00:01,['1990/08/15 00:00'],"['1990/08/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/08/15 00:01 [medline]', '1990/08/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 1990 Aug 15;50(16):5177-83.,,,,,,,,,,

Enzyme activity in normal granulocytes using Gal beta 1-3GalNAc alpha-o-nitrophenyl as substrate was 1.5 +/- 0.7 nmol/mg/h whereas activity in morphologically mature granulocytes from 6 patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) was 4.2 +/- 1.6 nmol/mg/h (P less than 0.05). Myeloblasts from 5 patients with CML in blast crisis showed enzyme activity levels of 6.5 +/- 2.5 nmol/mg/h. From 2 patients with CML, both blasts and granulocytes were obtained, with higher enzyme activity in the patients' blasts (7.1 nmol/mg/h) than in their granulocytes (4.9 nmol/mg/h) in both cases, suggesting that the increase in enzyme activity is related to the differentiation or proliferation status of the CML cells. However, similarly high enzyme levels were also seen in myeloblasts from acute myeloblastic leukemia patients (5.6 +/- 1.4 nmol/mg/h) and in some acute myeloblastic leukemia-derived cell lines (KG1a and HL60), suggesting that increased levels of this enzyme are not directly correlated with the presence of the Ph1 chromosome. This alpha(2-3)-sialyltransferase activity can also be detected in normal peripheral blood lymphocytes and exhibits increased activity in chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells and acute lymphoblastic leukemia. These data suggest that the level of enzyme activity may vary with growth rate and maturation status in myeloid and lymphoid hemopoietic cells. Finally, we have identified a glycoprotein in acute myeloblastic leukemia cells that serves as a substrate for the alpha(2-3)-sialyltransferase. The desialylated form of the glycoprotein was resialylated in vitro by the purified placental form of this alpha(2-3)-sialyltransferase and exhibits a molecular weight of about 150,000.","['Kanani, A', 'Sutherland, D R', 'Fibach, E', 'Matta, K L', 'Hindenburg, A', 'Brockhausen, I', 'Kuhns, W', 'Taub, R N', 'van den Eijnden, D H', 'Baker, M A']","['Kanani A', 'Sutherland DR', 'Fibach E', 'Matta KL', 'Hindenburg A', 'Brockhausen I', 'Kuhns W', 'Taub RN', 'van den Eijnden DH', 'Baker MA']","['Department of Medicine, Toronto General Hospital, Ontario, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['EC 2.4.99.- (Sialyltransferases)', 'EC 2.4.99.4 (beta-galactoside alpha-2,3-sialyltransferase)']",IM,"['Blast Crisis/enzymology', 'Cell Line', 'Granulocytes/*enzymology', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*enzymology/pathology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*enzymology', 'Lymphocytes/enzymology', 'Reference Values', 'Sialyltransferases/*metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/*enzymology']",1990/08/15 00:00,1990/08/15 00:01,['1990/08/15 00:00'],"['1990/08/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/08/15 00:01 [medline]', '1990/08/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 1990 Aug 15;50(16):5003-7.,"['CA31762/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA35329/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,

(a) Initiation of new replicons and possibly of Okazaki fragments was inhibited when the cells were treated with 0.1 microM TCN. The inhibition of replicon initiation was shown by the rate of alkaline elution of [3H]DNA from 15-min-[3H]thymidine-labeled cells being slower if the cells had been pretreated with TCN, indicating that the average size of actively replicating DNA strands was increased. (b) At 1 microM TCN elongation of previously initiated DNA chains was also inhibited. This conclusion was suggested by the decrease in the rate of alkaline elution of [3H]DNA, during postlabeling incubation, being less if TCN was included in the medium. The mechanism of inhibition of DNA synthesis by TCN was shown not to involve DNA strand breakage or cross-linking, inhibition of polyamine biosynthesis, inhibition of purine de novo biosynthesis, inhibition of DNA polymerase alpha or DNA primase, or inhibition of ligation of Okazaki fragments. The effects of TCN on the incorporation of [3H]thymidine into Okazaki fragments and higher molecular weight DNA suggested the possibilities of inhibition of Okazaki fragment initiation and/or DNA polymerase delta.","['Wotring, L L', 'Townsend, L B', 'Jones, L M', 'Borysko, K Z', 'Gildersleeve, D L', 'Parker, W B']","['Wotring LL', 'Townsend LB', 'Jones LM', 'Borysko KZ', 'Gildersleeve DL', 'Parker WB']","['Department of Pharmaceutical Chemistry, College of Pharmacy, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor 48109-1065.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Ribonucleosides)', '2421HMY9N6 (triciribine)', '2FZ7Y3VOQX (Spermine)', 'EC 2.7.7.- (DNA Primase)', 'EC 2.7.7.- (RNA Nucleotidyltransferases)', 'EC 2.7.7.7 (DNA Polymerase I)', 'U87FK77H25 (Spermidine)', 'V10TVZ52E4 (Putrescine)', 'VC2W18DGKR (Thymidine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'DNA Polymerase I/metabolism', 'DNA Primase', 'DNA Replication/*drug effects', 'DNA, Neoplasm/antagonists & inhibitors/biosynthesis/isolation & purification', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia L1210/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Putrescine/metabolism', 'RNA Nucleotidyltransferases/metabolism', 'Ribonucleosides/*pharmacology', 'Spermidine/metabolism', 'Spermine/metabolism', 'Thymidine/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/*drug effects/metabolism']",1990/08/15 00:00,1990/08/15 00:01,['1990/08/15 00:00'],"['1990/08/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/08/15 00:01 [medline]', '1990/08/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 1990 Aug 15;50(16):4891-9.,['CA34200-07/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,

A striking morphologic finding was the presence of clumped chromatin with grooved nuclei or Rieder cell formation in 20 cases. Other than a slight excess of the pre-B immunophenotype, the near-triploid cases did not appear to differ substantially from the general ALL population in clinical features. In contrast, near-tetraploid cases were more often associated with a T-cell immunophenotype (47% v 14%, P less than .001) and L2 morphology (30% v 22%, P less than .01), and were older at diagnosis (median age, 8.6 v 4.8 years, P = .01) than cases with other ploidies.

Hybrids were derived from 18 of the 23 patients, but only hybrids from 13 patients were found to secrete immunoglobulin (Ig) (IgM kappa 4, IgM lambda 8, and only kappa light chain 1). Supernatants of these hybrids were tested against an extensive panel of antigens by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, indirect immunofluorescence, and hemagglutination. At the same time, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from 15 of these patients, including most patients from whom secreting hybrids had not been obtained, were stimulated with phorbol myristate acetate (PMA). Our results indicated that secreting heterohybrids from CLL B lymphocytes are frequently obtained; however, this is highly dependent on the light chain phenotype, since 8 of 9 lambda-expressing CLL produced hybrids secreting complete Igs, as compared with 4 of 12 kappa-expressing CLL. In addition, B lymphocytes of most patients from whom we failed to derive secreting hybrids also failed to secrete Ig on PMA stimulation. Secondly, CD5+ B-CLL lymphocytes were frequently committed to the production of natural autoantibodies, since in 8 of 15 cases (including hybrids and PMA stimulation) anti-Fc activity was found; three of these also displayed a multispecific binding pattern.","['Borche, L', 'Lim, A', 'Binet, J L', 'Dighiero, G']","['Borche L', 'Lim A', 'Binet JL', 'Dighiero G']","['Immunohematologie et Immunopathologie, Institut Pasteur, Paris, France.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Autoantibodies)', '0 (Phorbol Esters)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Animals', 'Antibody Formation', 'Autoantibodies/*immunology', 'B-Lymphocytes/drug effects/*immunology/pathology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Hybrid Cells/immunology/pathology', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/immunology/*pathology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Middle Aged', 'Multiple Myeloma/immunology/pathology', 'Phorbol Esters/pharmacology']",1990/08/01 00:00,1990/08/01 00:01,['1990/08/01 00:00'],"['1990/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 1990 Aug 1;76(3):562-9.,,['S0006-4971(20)84233-5 [pii]'],,,,,,,,

A Pediatric Oncology Group study.,489-94,"Among 3,638 children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) entered on Pediatric Oncology Group (POG) protocols between June 1981 and April 1989, successful cytogenetic studies were available for 2,519, 58 (2.3%) of which had the Philadelphia (Ph) chromosome detected. Features associated with the presence of the Ph chromosome were high leukocyte count (median, 33 x 10(9)/L), older age median, 9.6 years), a higher proportion of French-American-British L2 morphology, and a lower frequency of mediastinal mass. Immunologic marker studies at diagnosis in 56 Ph+ cases identified early pre-B ALL in 42 cases (75%), pre-B-cell in 9 (16%), and T-cell in 5 (9%). This distribution is similar to that found in Ph+ ALL. Intensive multiagent chemotherapy induced complete remissions in only 78% of eligible Ph+ patients compared with 96% of those without an identified Ph chromosome (P less than .001). Of 44 eligible Ph+ patients treated on POG frontline protocols for children with non-T, non-B-cell ALL, 27 have failed therapy, compared with 520 of 1,892 without an identified Ph chromosome (logrank P less than .001). Ph+ ALL is an aggressive form of acute leukemia that frequently presents in older children with a high leukocyte count, FAB L2 morphology, and a pseudodiploid karyotype, and becomes multidrug-resistant early. Thus, Ph+ cases require early identification to permit treatment with intensive induction regimens and experimental approaches such as bone marrow transplantation.","['Crist, W', 'Carroll, A', 'Shuster, J', 'Jackson, J', 'Head, D', 'Borowitz, M', 'Behm, F', 'Link, M', 'Steuber, P', 'Ragab, A']","['Crist W', 'Carroll A', 'Shuster J', 'Jackson J', 'Head D', 'Borowitz M', 'Behm F', 'Link M', 'Steuber P', 'Ragab A', 'et al.']","[""St Jude Children's Research Hospital.""]",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Immunoglobulin Fc Fragments)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', 'EC 3.5.1.1 (Asparaginase)', 'VB0R961HZT (Prednisone)']",IM,"['Asparaginase/therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cohort Studies', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Fc Fragments/genetics/immunology', 'Male', 'Phenotype', '*Philadelphia Chromosome', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/*genetics/pathology', 'Prednisone/therapeutic use', 'Prognosis', 'Vincristine/therapeutic use']",1990/08/01 00:00,1990/08/01 00:01,['1990/08/01 00:00'],"['1990/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 1990 Aug 1;76(3):489-94.,"['CA21765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA29139/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA30969/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",['S0006-4971(20)84223-2 [pii]'],,,,,,,,

The two-dimensional patterns of [35S]methionine-labelled proteins on two-dimensional O'Farrell gels of queuine-deficient (Q-), compared with queuine-supplemented (Q+) growing cells, showed specific characteristic alterations in the synthesis of 36 and 42 kd basic proteins. According to pI values and immunoreactivity with anti-LDH antibodies, the 36 kd proteins represent various forms of LDH A subunits or closely related proteins. Cell-free systems of protein synthesis were established from growing (Q-) or (Q+) cells. Addition of 3 x 10(-8) M queuine to the (Q-) in vitro system inhibited the incorporation of [35S]methionine into total protein to approximately 20%; raising the concentration of queuine up to 1 x 10(-6) M did not increase the inhibitory effect appreciably. In the (Q-) system, a series of 36 kd proteins, with pI values corresponding to LDH A isoforms, were synthesized. The in vitro synthesis of these proteins was completely inhibited by addition of queuine at a concentration of 3 x 10(-8) M. Furthermore, the expression of certain other proteins was lower in the (Q+) than in the (Q-) in vitro system. Labelling of growing (Q+) or (Q-) cells with [32P]orthophosphate and subsequent analysis of phosphoproteins on two-dimensional O'Farrell gels showed that queuine inhibited the synthesis of distinct phosphoproteins. Protein synthesis performed in cell-free (Q-) or (Q+) systems in the presence of non-labelled amino acids and 32P-labelled gamma ATP also indicated that queuine interferes with the synthesis and/or phosphorylation of particular phosphoproteins.","['Mahr, U', 'Bohm, P', 'Kersten, H']","['Mahr U', 'Bohm P', 'Kersten H']","['Institut fur Biochemie, Universitat Erlangen-Nurnberg, FRG.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Biofactors,"BioFactors (Oxford, England)",8807441,"['0 (Isoenzymes)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Phosphoproteins)', '5Z93L87A1R (Guanine)', '72496-59-4 (queuine)', 'EC 1.1.1.27 (L-Lactate Dehydrogenase)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell-Free System', 'Friend murine leukemia virus', 'Guanine/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Isoenzymes', 'L-Lactate Dehydrogenase/biosynthesis', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/pathology', 'Mice', 'Neoplasm Proteins/biosynthesis', 'Phosphoproteins/biosynthesis', 'Phosphorylation', '*Protein Biosynthesis/*drug effects', 'Protein Processing, Post-Translational/*drug effects', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1990/07/01 00:00,1990/07/01 00:01,['1990/07/01 00:00'],"['1990/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Biofactors. 1990 Jul;2(3):185-92.,,,,,,,,,,

Using a combination of the polymerase chain reaction and conventional screening procedures, we have isolated cDNA clones encoding the human platelet/human erythroleukemia (HEL) cell 12-lipoxygenase. From the deduced primary structure, human platelet/HEL 12-lipoxygenase would encode a Mr 75,000 protein consisting of 663 amino acids. The cDNA encoding the full-length protein (pCDNA-121x) under the control of the cytomegalovirus promoter was expressed in simian COS-M6 cells. Intact cells and lysed-cell supernatants were able to synthesize 12-H(P)ETE from arachidonic acid, whereas no 12-H(P)ETE synthesis was detected in mock-transfected cells. A single 2.4-kilobase mRNA was detected in erythroleukemia cells but not in several other tissues and cell lines evaluated by Northern blot analysis. Comparison of the human platelet/HEL 12-lipoxygenase sequence with that of porcine leukocyte 12-lipoxygenase and human reticulocyte 15-lipoxygenase revealed 65% amino acid identity to both enzymes. By contrast, the leukocyte 12-lipoxygenase is 86% identical to human reticulocyte 15-lipoxygenase. Sequence data and previously demonstrated immunochemical and biochemical evidence support the existence of distinct 12-lipoxygenase isoforms. The availability of cDNA probes for human platelet/HEL cell 12-lipoxygenase should facilitate elucidation of the biological role of this pathway.","['Funk, C D', 'Furci, L', 'FitzGerald, G A']","['Funk CD', 'Furci L', 'FitzGerald GA']","['Division of Clinical Pharmacology, Vanderbilt University, Nashville, TN 37232.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['EC 1.13.11.- (Arachidonate Lipoxygenases)', 'EC 1.13.11.31 (Arachidonate 12-Lipoxygenase)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Arachidonate 12-Lipoxygenase/blood/*genetics', 'Arachidonate Lipoxygenases/*genetics', 'Base Sequence', 'Blood Platelets/*enzymology', 'Cell Line', '*Cloning, Molecular', 'Gene Library', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*enzymology/genetics', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Restriction Mapping', 'Sequence Homology, Nucleic Acid']",1990/08/01 00:00,1990/08/01 00:01,['1990/08/01 00:00'],"['1990/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1990 Aug;87(15):5638-42. doi: 10.1073/pnas.87.15.5638.,['HL30400/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States'],['10.1073/pnas.87.15.5638 [doi]'],,PMC54382,['GENBANK/M35418'],,,,,

We demonstrate here that the full graft-versus-leukemia effect of allogeneic T lymphocytes is obtained even when GVHD is markedly diminished by the coadministration of IL-2 and TCD syngeneic marrow. This methodology represents an approach to the treatment of leukemia in which the beneficial effects of allogeneic T cells can be exploited while their major deleterious effect, GVHD, is avoided.

Cases that occurred within 12 months of the first malignant neoplasm were excluded. Survival was estimated using Cox proportional-hazards modeling, with age, sex, and specific type of ANLL as covariates. The 6271 patients with de novo ANLL had an estimated 12-month survival of 30%, while the 107 patients with treatment-related ANLL (radiation therapy, 60; chemotherapy, 29; both, 18) had an estimated 12-month survival of 10%. This is not due to lingering effects of the first tumor since ANLL following solid tumors not treated with chemotherapy or radiation therapy (118 cases) has similar survival (estimated 12-month survival, 36%) as de novo ANLL. We conclude that ANLL that occurs after chemotherapy or radiation therapy is biologically more aggressive and/or resistant to therapy than spontaneous ANLL.

Such studies were done to examine whether CFU-GM responses to heat are influenced by in vitro growth conditions. In terms of heat response CFU-GM progenitors from LTBMCs showed increased heat sensitivity when compared to CFU-GM from mice, with CFU-GM from 33 degrees C cultures being more heat-sensitive than those from 37 degrees C cultures. The kinetics of thermotolerance development and decay in CFU-GM were similar from all three systems. Thermotolerance was maximum at 3-9 h, began to decay by 24 h and was absent by 48 h from cells obtained from mice and LTBMCs grown at 37 degrees C. However, CFU-GM from 33 degrees C LTBMCs showed a delay in decay of thermotolerance. The kinetics of the development and decay of thermotolerance remained as above and was independent of incubation conditions whether bone marrow was left in situ or incubated in vitro in medium containing various colony-stimulating factors (CSF) or medium containing no CSF.

Preincubation of Epo with anti-Epo antibody completely abolished this enhancement, indicating that the increase in colony numbers was caused by Epo itself. Cell surface phenotype analysis of colonies produced by Epo plus PHA-LCM showed no increase in percentages of erythroid and megakaryocyte lineages. The addition of Epo also increased the self-renewal capacity of leukaemic blast cells. Fresh leukaemic cells did not express Epo receptors, but they were induced after incubation with PHA-LCM.

In none of the 25 primary samples tested could a continuously in vitro growing cell line be obtained by adding IL2 to the culture medium. Although IL2 induced a proliferative signal in three of the 31 acute leukaemias analysed, the overall 3H-thymidine uptake of the neoplastic cells was significantly reduced (P less than 0.05) in the presence of IL2. The unlikelihood of an important proliferative signal triggered by IL2 was confirmed in a semisolid clonogenic assay, which failed to document an increased colony growth in the 26 samples studied. Furthermore, using a colorimetric assay as a test for cell proliferation and survival, in seven of the 11 fresh acute leukaemia samples tested a 22-40% reduction in viability was observed in the presence of IL2, while in the remaining four, IL2 was ineffective. In order to investigate the effect of IL2 in an in vivo setting, an experimental model in heavily immunosuppressed nu/nu mice was established. In no case did IL2 promote the in vivo proliferation and growth of human myeloid and lymphoid acute leukaemia cells injected in the mice. On the contrary, with seven of the eight leukaemic cell lines which gave rise spontaneously to leukaemic masses, this could be prevented when the mice received locally 300 U of IL2 three times daily for 90 d. IL2 also blocked the growth in vivo of three fresh acute leukaemia samples (two myeloid and one lymphoid). Co-culture experiments using leukaemic cell lines and increasing numbers of normal lymphocytes suggest that the inhibitory effect of IL2 is probably exerted via an indirect mechanism. These findings, coupled to the well-documented ability of IL2 to generate lymphokine activated killer cells cytolytic against leukaemic blasts, further point to the potential role of immunotherapy with IL2 in the management of patients with haematological malignancies.","['Foa, R', 'Caretto, P', 'Fierro, M T', 'Bonferroni, M', 'Cardona, S', 'Guarini, A', 'Lista, P', 'Pegoraro, L', 'Mandelli, F', 'Forni, G']","['Foa R', 'Caretto P', 'Fierro MT', 'Bonferroni M', 'Cardona S', 'Guarini A', 'Lista P', 'Pegoraro L', 'Mandelli F', 'Forni G', 'et al.']","['Dipartimento di Scienze Biomediche e Oncologia Umana, University of Torino, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Survival', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-2/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*pathology/therapy', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Nude', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*drug effects/pathology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*pathology/therapy', 'Recombinant Proteins', 'Tumor Stem Cell Assay']",1990/05/01 00:00,1990/05/01 00:01,['1990/05/01 00:00'],"['1990/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 1990 May;75(1):34-40. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.1990.tb02613.x.,,['10.1111/j.1365-2141.1990.tb02613.x [doi]'],,,,,,,,

Agreement between two observers was obtained for 94% of the data. BM cellularity was increased in 63% of the cases and was higher in refractory anaemia with excess of blasts (RAEB). RAEB in transformation (RAEB-t) and chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia (CMML) (P = 0.001). Dysmegakaryopoiesis and dyserythropoiesis were present respectively in 83% and 72% of the cases, with slight differences among the FAB subtypes. Abnormal localization of immature precursors (ALIP) was found in more than half of the cases and somewhat more frequently seen in the RAEB + RAEB-t + CMML group (P = 0.07). Eosinophilia, plasmacytosis and reticulin fibrosis were evident in 26%, 18% and 47% of the cases respectively. Cellularity (P = 0.006), eosinophilia (P = 0.009) and, to some extent, dysmegakaryopoiesis (P = 0.07) bore a certain relationship with survival on univariate analysis. The presence of ALIP was not seen to affect the outcome. Multivariate analysis showed that the cellularity and presence of dysmegakaryopoiesis, in BM biopsy, added significant independent prognostic information to that achieved with age, platelet count and proportion of blast cells in BM aspirate, three variables with proven prognostic value in MDS patients. Using a regression model including these five characteristics we have stratified the patients into low, intermediate and high-risk groups with different survivals (P = 0.00001). The present findings show that BM biopsy is able to provide both morphological characteristics and information about the prognosis of survival, and should thus be included in the initial evaluation of MDS.","['Rios, A', 'Canizo, M C', 'Sanz, M A', 'Vallespi, T', 'Sanz, G', 'Torrabadella, M', 'Gomis, F', 'Ruiz, C', 'San Miguel, J F']","['Rios A', 'Canizo MC', 'Sanz MA', 'Vallespi T', 'Sanz G', 'Torrabadella M', 'Gomis F', 'Ruiz C', 'San Miguel JF']","['Hospital Clinico, Salamanca, Spain.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,['0 (Reticulin)'],IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Bone Marrow/*pathology', 'Eosinophils/pathology', 'Erythroblasts/pathology', 'Erythropoiesis', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Lymphocytes/pathology', 'Male', 'Megakaryocytes/pathology', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/mortality/*pathology', 'Plasma Cells/pathology', 'Prognosis', 'Reticulin']",1990/05/01 00:00,1990/05/01 00:01,['1990/05/01 00:00'],"['1990/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 1990 May;75(1):26-33. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.1990.tb02612.x.,,['10.1111/j.1365-2141.1990.tb02612.x [doi]'],,,,,,,,

Among the three derivatives, OL-NME shows the most potent incorporation (83 micrograms/mg protein LDL) compared to ST-NME (37 micrograms/mg protein LDL) and PAL-NME (58 micrograms/mg protein LDL). The size of OL-NME-LDL was determined by size distribution particles, showing their homogeneity compared to native LDL. When culture normal human fibroblasts were incubated with [125I]LDL incorporated drug, they bound to the LDL receptor with the same affinity as native LDL and were internalized and degraded intracellularly. The presence of excess native LDL inhibited the cellular uptake and degradation of [125I]drug-LDL. We have used [125I]acetyl-LDL as a probe for a binding site on macrophages that mediated the uptake and degradation of chemically altered or denatured LDL. Mouse peritoneal macrophages were shown to take up and degrade [125I]acetyl-LDL at rates that were greater than those for the uptake and degradation of native [125I]LDL and [125I]drug-LDL. The in vitro cytotoxic test on L1210 murine leukemic cells demonstrated that the complex was cytotoxic and was more effective than the free drug. This cytotoxic activity of the drug-LDL complex depends on the LDL high affinity receptor since the addition of native LDL reduces the killing power. In contrast, methylated LDL, which does not bind to the LDL receptor, has no effect on it. We conclude that it is possible to incorporate a large amount of cytotoxic drug into LDL without modifying their cellular metabolism via the high affinity LDL receptor pathway. It indicates also that the delivery of lipophilic drugs using LDL might provide distinct advantages over the use of synthetic carriers.","['Samadi-Baboli, M', 'Favre, G', 'Bernadou, J', 'Berg, D', 'Soula, G']","['Samadi-Baboli M', 'Favre G', 'Bernadou J', 'Berg D', 'Soula G']","['Laboratoire de Biochimie, Faculte des Sciences Pharmaceutiques, France.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Biochem Pharmacol,Biochemical pharmacology,0101032,"['0 (Alkaloids)', '0 (Ellipticines)', '0 (Lipoproteins, LDL)', '0 (Receptors, LDL)', '117VLW7484 (ellipticine)']",IM,"['Alkaloids/*metabolism', 'Animals', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Ellipticines/administration & dosage/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'Leukemia L1210/metabolism', 'Lipoproteins, LDL/administration & dosage/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'Macrophages/metabolism', 'Receptors, LDL/*metabolism', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1990/07/15 00:00,1990/07/15 00:01,['1990/07/15 00:00'],"['1990/07/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/07/15 00:01 [medline]', '1990/07/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Biochem Pharmacol. 1990 Jul 15;40(2):203-12. doi: 10.1016/0006-2952(90)90679-f.,,"['0006-2952(90)90679-F [pii]', '10.1016/0006-2952(90)90679-f [doi]']",,,,,,,,

EFMGT involves the exposure of cells in suspension to an electric field which transiently allows the entry of DNA into the cell and its subsequent integration and expression. Plasmids bearing the neo gene were used to identify and select transfected clonogenic cells manifested by geneticin resistance in semisolid medium. Transfection efficiency is significantly affected by the following variables: voltage, capacitance, time constant, number of pulses, buffer type and temperature, DNA concentration, configuration, and promoter type. Cell cycle status also appears to be critical as shown in studies employing aphidicolin synchronization. Using optimal conditions, we have consistently achieved a transfection efficiency of 0.3-0.4% of clonogenic cells per microgram DNA. Stability of neo gene expression was also demonstrated after 4 months in nonselective culture conditions. This level of efficiency compares favorably with other reports of gene transfer into human hemopoietic progenitor cells.","['Croaker, G M', 'Wass, E J', 'Iland, H J']","['Croaker GM', 'Wass EJ', 'Iland HJ']","['Kanematsu Laboratories, Royal Prince Alfred Hospital, Camperdown, NSW, Australia.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Buffers)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",IM,"['Blast Crisis/*genetics', 'Buffers', 'Cell Cycle', 'DNA/genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*genetics/pathology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*genetics/pathology', 'Plasmids', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/physiology', 'Temperature', '*Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1990/07/01 00:00,1990/07/01 00:01,['1990/07/01 00:00'],"['1990/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 1990 Jul;4(7):502-7.,,,,,,,,,,

The preparation of further complexes with sterically hindered diamine backbones, such as 2,5-dimethyl-2,5-hexanediamine, is exemplified. The biological activity of all complexes were compared. The 2,2/c,c complexes are particularly active in tissue culture in cells resistant both to cisplatin and its 1,2-diaminocyclohexane (dach) analogue. The inhibition of DNA synthesis in L1210/0 cells by the 2,2/c,c complexes is equivalent to that of cisplatin. The presence of at least one cis-[Pt(amine)2] unit appears necessary for activity in cell lines sensitive to cisplatin.","['Farrell, N', 'Qu, Y', 'Hacker, M P']","['Farrell N', 'Qu Y', 'Hacker MP']","['Department of Chemistry, University of Vermont, Burlington 05405.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Med Chem,Journal of medicinal chemistry,9716531,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Cyclohexylamines)', '0 (Organoplatinum Compounds)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'C82TX76BHH (1,2-cyclohexanediamine)', 'Q20Q21Q62J (Cisplatin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', '*Cisplatin', '*Cyclohexylamines', 'DNA/biosynthesis', 'Drug Resistance', 'Leukemia L1210/drug therapy/metabolism', 'Leukemia P388/drug therapy', 'Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Molecular Structure', 'Organoplatinum Compounds/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1990/08/01 00:00,1990/08/01 00:01,['1990/08/01 00:00'],"['1990/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Med Chem. 1990 Aug;33(8):2179-84. doi: 10.1021/jm00170a021.,"['CA 01205/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 32244/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",['10.1021/jm00170a021 [doi]'],,,,,,,,

The McAb CD19 was the marker most consistently expressed in B lineage ALL, being positive in 100% of cases, compared to CD24 and CD22 expressed in 82% and 79%, respectively. Similarly, for the T lymphoid lineage, the McAb CD3 was the most reliable and specific marker, being expressed in all T-ALL cases including those with an early thymic phenotype (CD7+, TdT+). Lymphoblasts from eight adults (12.9%) and three children (11.1%) expressed one to four myeloid associated antigens recognized by CD13, CD14, CD33 and anti-myeloperoxidase. There were no substantial clinical and morphological differences between the two ALL groups with or without myeloid associated markers. However, the presence of myeloid associated markers in adult ALL was associated with a significantly lower complete remission (CR) rate (P = 0.05) and with a shorter survival (P = 0.001); this variable was independent of advanced age and high WBC. It is concluded that immunophenotypic analysis in ALL should include myeloid markers for its probable prognostic implications.","['Urbano-Ispizua, A', 'Matutes, E', 'Villamor, N', 'Ribera, J M', 'Feliu, E', 'Montserrat, E', 'Granena, A', 'Vives-Corrons, J L', 'Rozman, C']","['Urbano-Ispizua A', 'Matutes E', 'Villamor N', 'Ribera JM', 'Feliu E', 'Montserrat E', 'Granena A', 'Vives-Corrons JL', 'Rozman C']","['Haematology Laboratory Department, Hospital Clinic i Provincial de Barcelona, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/*analysis', 'B-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Bone Marrow/*immunology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*immunology/mortality', 'Prognosis', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology']",1990/06/01 00:00,1990/06/01 00:01,['1990/06/01 00:00'],"['1990/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 1990 Jun;75(2):202-7. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.1990.tb02649.x.,,['10.1111/j.1365-2141.1990.tb02649.x [doi]'],,,,,,,,

Nine of 19 allografts and two of four autografts had thrombocytopenia requiring platelet transfusion more than 30 d after BMT. There was a close correlation between MK-GPA and platelet count. MK-GPA reached a maximum before day 30 after BMT but remained elevated in patients with persisting thrombocytopenia secondary to poor engraftment, graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) or relapse. Recent platelet transfusion did not suppress serum MK-GPA. Two of four patients undergoing autologous BMT for acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) showed delayed platelet recovery and persistence of MK-GPA in the serum. Seven further AML remission marrows were tested for megakaryocyte production before or after autologous BMT, using pooled sera with known MK-GPA activity. Megakaryocyte generation was reduced before BMT and absent in post transplant samples. This failure of MK production was not corrected by T-cell depletion or by the presence of adherent cells from normal marrow. We conclude that thrombocytopenia after BMT is associated with an appropriate increase in MK-GPA levels in response to a reduction in the megakaryocyte pool rather than the platelet pool, and that persisting thrombocytopenia after autologous BMT is due to decreased numbers of available megakaryocyte precursors.","['Adams, J A', 'Gordon, A A', 'Jiang, Y Z', 'Macdonald, D', 'McCarthy, D M', 'Zuiable, A', 'Treleaven, J', 'Powles, R L', 'Barrett, A J']","['Adams JA', 'Gordon AA', 'Jiang YZ', 'Macdonald D', 'McCarthy DM', 'Zuiable A', 'Treleaven J', 'Powles RL', 'Barrett AJ']","['Department of Haematology, Royal Postgraduate Medical School, Hammersmith Hospital, Sutton, London.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (GPI-Linked Proteins)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Proteins)', 'J27WDC343N (Mesothelin)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/*pathology', 'Female', 'GPI-Linked Proteins', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*surgery', 'Male', 'Megakaryocytes/*pathology', 'Membrane Glycoproteins', 'Mesothelin', 'Middle Aged', 'Platelet Count', 'Postoperative Period', 'Proteins/*analysis', 'Thrombocytopenia/blood/*etiology/pathology']",1990/06/01 00:00,1990/06/01 00:01,['1990/06/01 00:00'],"['1990/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 1990 Jun;75(2):195-201. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.1990.tb02648.x.,,['10.1111/j.1365-2141.1990.tb02648.x [doi]'],,,,,,,,

We have tested the ability of IFN to slow the leukocyte doubling time (Ldt) and to prolong remissions induced by busulphan in 14 patients with chronic granulocytic leukaemia (CGL). Patients served as their own controls; the Ldt during relapse from a busulphan-induced remission on no therapy was determined and compared with the Ldt on IFN maintenance therapy. The initial dose of IFN (2 x 10(6) U M-2 subcutaneously, three times per week) was adjusted up, or down, to prevent the leukocyte count from rising and the platelet count from falling below 75 x 10(9) l-1. The dose of IFN required to prevent relapse in seven patients ranged from 1 x 10(6) U M-2 three times per week to 5.2 x 10(6) U M-2 daily, with a median of 2 x 10(6) U M-2 three times per week. IFN maintenance therapy has prevented relapse in six patients for more than 22 months to more than 68 months. In five patients the Ldt was slowed initially but the disease later progressed in four patients to enter the accelerated (three patients) or blast phase (one patient). The Ldt during IFN therapy did not change from the Ldt on no therapy in one patient; this patient later progressed to the blast phase. In two additional patients the leukaemia progressed during the first course of IFN, with shortening of the Ldt; both of these patients entered the blast phase. In the four patients who have discontinued IFN following relapse in the chronic phase, the Ldt remained prolonged for at least one relapse after the IFN was stopped. IFN maintenance therapy failed to control the leukocyte count in the six patients with a control Ldt of less than 40 days and five of these have progressed to enter the accelerated or blast phase. The early survival of this group of patients resembles the survival of 'good risk' CGL patients reported by others. We conclude that IFN maintenance therapy does alter the relapse pattern of a subset of CGL patients, either slowing the Ldt or preventing relapse.","['Bergsagel, D E', 'Messner, H']","['Bergsagel DE', 'Messner H']","['University of Toronto, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Cancer,British journal of cancer,0370635,"['0 (Interferon Type I)', '0 (Interferon alpha-2)', '0 (Interferon-alpha)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', 'G1LN9045DK (Busulfan)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Busulfan/*therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Interferon Type I/*therapeutic use', 'Interferon alpha-2', 'Interferon-alpha/*therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/genetics/mortality/pathology/surgery/therapy', 'Leukocyte Count/drug effects', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Philadelphia Chromosome', 'Recombinant Proteins', 'Remission Induction']",1990/06/01 00:00,1990/06/01 00:01,['1990/06/01 00:00'],"['1990/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Br J Cancer. 1990 Jun;61(6):895-8. doi: 10.1038/bjc.1990.200.,,['10.1038/bjc.1990.200 [doi]'],,PMC1971686,,,,,,

Newborn mice were infected with Fr-MLV and, at one month of age, were transplanted with two pituitary glands under the kidney capsule. Sham-operated infected mice and uninfected transplanted mice served as controls. SPG selectively reduced the mean survival times of infected mice. Histopathology showed that, while most infected non-transplanted mice developed lymphoid leukaemias, virtually all Fr-MLF-infected mice given SPG developed erythroleukaemias. Experiments in vitro showed that Fr-MLV infection markedly depressed concanavalin A induced DNA synthesis in cells from spleen, thymus and lymph nodes. Addition of prolactin or growth hormone further suppressed lectin-induced mitogenesis of lymphoid cells from infected mice, but failed to influence the response of uninfected controls. These experiments indicate that, in mice, pituitary hormones modulate the development and the histological features of Fr-MLV induced leukaemias, and suggest that endocrine-immunological interactions play a role in retrovirus induced tumorigenesis.","['Fontanini, G', 'Basolo, F', 'Garzelli, C', 'Squartini, F', 'Toniolo, A']","['Fontanini G', 'Basolo F', 'Garzelli C', 'Squartini F', 'Toniolo A']","['Institute of Pathological Anatomy and Histology, University of Pisa, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Cancer,British journal of cancer,0370635,"['9002-62-4 (Prolactin)', '9002-72-6 (Growth Hormone)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Female', 'Friend murine leukemia virus', 'Growth Hormone/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*etiology/mortality/pathology', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/etiology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Pituitary Gland/*transplantation', 'Prolactin/pharmacology']",1990/06/01 00:00,1990/06/01 00:01,['1990/06/01 00:00'],"['1990/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Br J Cancer. 1990 Jun;61(6):841-5. doi: 10.1038/bjc.1990.188.,,['10.1038/bjc.1990.188 [doi]'],,PMC1971688,,,,,,

In most cases, the composition and thickness of these cells do not vary unless the cells are in intimate contact with hematopoietic tissue. In that instance, they are seen as a single layer adjacent to hematopoietic tissue or as a zone of tightly packed or loosely arranged mononuclear (hematopoietic) cells, some apparently originating from the endosteum. In a reparative process, such as following BM harvest, during which bony trabeculae (BT) are mechanically fractured, these cells are seen giving rise to osteoprogenitor (osteoblasts and osteoclasts) cells. Occasionally, the EC appear similar to BM stromal cells (morphologically and by their association with collagen/reticulin fibers) and are best seen at or near the BT that are cut tangentially. Short processes extending from the EC towards the underlying osteocytes have also been observed, suggesting that a channel of communication exists between them and osteocytes. Our observations, coupled with the experimental findings of others (i.e., that hematopoietic stem cells are concentrated near the endosteum, that cells responsible for BM and stroma regeneration are derived from the endosteal layer, and that high concentrations of hematopoietic colony-stimulating factors are produced there), indicate that, in addition to functioning as a simple membranous covering layer for BT, the endosteum helps to support osteocytes and maintains mineral homeostasis.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","['Islam, A', 'Glomski, C', 'Henderson, E S']","['Islam A', 'Glomski C', 'Henderson ES']","['Department of Hematologic Oncology, Roswell Park Cancer Institute, Buffalo, New York.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Anat Rec,The Anatomical record,0370540,,IM,"['Bone Marrow/pathology/*physiology', 'Bone Marrow Cells', 'Bone Marrow Diseases/*pathology/physiopathology', '*Hematopoiesis', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Hairy Cell/pathology/physiopathology', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/pathology/physiopathology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/pathology/physiopathology', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/pathology/physiopathology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/pathology/physiopathology', 'Reference Values']",1990/07/01 00:00,1990/07/01 00:01,['1990/07/01 00:00'],"['1990/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Anat Rec. 1990 Jul;227(3):300-6. doi: 10.1002/ar.1092270304.,,['10.1002/ar.1092270304 [doi]'],,,,,,,,

DIC in patients with AML has been attributed to procoagulants released from granular fractions of leukemic blast cells. The present study was designed (i) to evaluate thrombin activity in patients with AML by measuring plasma levels of fibrinopeptide A (FPA) prior to chemotherapy, and (ii) to examine whether a relationship between FPA levels and the number of peripheral blast cells exists. Plasma levels of FPA were determined using a commercially available RIA kit. To remove fibrinogen and the majority of elastase-induced fibrinopeptides (A alpha 1-21) known to crossreact with the FPA (A alpha 1-16) antiserum used in this assay, plasma samples were treated with bentonite prior to further processing. The study was conducted on 5 patients with APL and on 22 patients with other subtypes of AML. Peripheral blast cell counts at initial diagnosis ranged from 2100 to 56,000/microliters in patients with APL and from 1900 to 151,000/microliters in patients with other AML subtypes. The mean (+/- 1 SEM) pretreatment plasma level of FPA was significantly higher (p = 0.021) in the 5 patients with APL (38.2 +/- 8.3 ng/ml) than in patients with other AML subtypes (8.1 +/- 0.7 ng/ml). No relationship was found between peripheral blast cell counts and the corresponding FPA levels in the total group of 27 patients. However, when considering the 5 patients with APL separately, a significant correlation was observed between peripheral blast cell number and FPA plasma levels (r = 0.88, p = 0.050).

For tumor-derived FPGS, aminopterin was the most preferred substrate overall, exhibiting the lowest value for apparent Km and highest Vmax. The other analogues and folic acid exhibited nearly 2-fold lower Vmax. Folic acid exhibited a 3-fold higher Km than aminopterin. Alkylation of aminopterin (methotrexate) or carbon for nitrogen substitution (10-deazaaminopterin) at N-10 increased Km 3- to 6-fold, while alkylation at C10 (10-ethyl-10-deazaaminopterin) restored Km to near equivalency with aminopterin. For FPGS derived from proliferative intestinal epithelium, aminopterin was also the preferred substrate, but the value for Vmax (derived with crude cell-free extract) was 6-fold lower than for tumor cell FPGS. Values for Vmax (derived with partially purified FPGS) for the other 4-aminofolate analogues and folic acid were similar (methotrexate) or 2-fold (10-ethyl-10-deazaaminopterin) and 5-fold (folic acid) lower than for aminopterin. The value for Km derived with aminopterin was similar to that derived for either tumor cell FPGS. The value for folic acid was 2-fold higher, and alkylation of aminopterin (methotrexate) or carbon to nitrogen substitution (10-deazaaminopterin) at N-10 with (10-ethyl-10-deazaaminopterin) or without alkylation markedly increased Km (27-, 90-, and greater than 100-fold, respectively, for methotrexate, 10-ethyl-10-deazaaminopterin, and 10-deazaaminopterin). In other studies, it was found that the diglutamate of aminopterin (aminopterin +G1) was a relatively poor substrate for FPGS derived from all three sources compared with methotrexate diglutamate, both in respect to values for Km and Vmax that were measured in each case. Findings with FPGS derived from L1210 cells were confirmed by high-pressure liquid chromatography analysis of product formation during the reaction with the parent compounds. The significance of the results presented here to the question of relative toxicity and therapeutic activity of these analogues is discussed.","['Rumberger, B G', 'Barrueco, J R', 'Sirotnak, F M']","['Rumberger BG', 'Barrueco JR', 'Sirotnak FM']","['Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York 10021.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Folic Acid Antagonists)', 'EC 6.3.2.- (Peptide Synthases)', 'EC 6.3.2.17 (folylpolyglutamate synthetase)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Epithelium/enzymology', 'Folic Acid Antagonists/*metabolism', 'Intestine, Small/*enzymology', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia L1210/*enzymology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred Strains', 'Muscle, Smooth/enzymology', 'Peptide Synthases/isolation & purification/*metabolism', 'Sarcoma 180/*enzymology', 'Substrate Specificity']",1990/08/01 00:00,1990/08/01 00:01,['1990/08/01 00:00'],"['1990/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 1990 Aug 1;50(15):4639-43.,"['CA08748/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA18856/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA22764/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,

We have examined the specific effects of transient pharmacological purine dNTP pool perturbations on mutations induced at the hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HPRT) locus in a cultured human T-lymphoblast cell line. Incubation of CEM cells with 50 microM 2'-deoxyguanosine for 6 h increased intracellular dGTP levels 43-fold and induced a 40-fold increase in mutation frequency at the HPRT locus. Six-h incubations with 5, 10, and 20 microM 2'-deoxyadenosine increased dATP pools 4.8-, 8-, and 14.5-fold, respectively, with 59-, 34-, and 43-fold increases in HPRT mutant fractions. In contrast, 24-h incubations with hydroxyurea at concentrations which inhibited cell growth to similar extents did not induce HPRT mutations. Sequencing of HPRT complementary DNA derived from mutant cell lines revealed that the mutations induced by transient purine dNTP pool perturbations exhibited no significant misincorporation of the nucleotide in excess or next-nucleotide effect, and were similar in nature and location to spontaneous HPRT mutations. We conclude that mutations caused by transient purine dNTP pool elevations in these dividing cells are most likely induced by inhibition of DNA repair processes.","['Mattano, S S', 'Palella, T D', 'Mitchell, B S']","['Mattano SS', 'Palella TD', 'Mitchell BS']","['Department of Internal Medicine, University of Michigan Medical School, Ann Arbor 48109-0680.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Deoxyadenosines)', '0 (Deoxyribonucleotides)', '0 (Oligonucleotide Probes)', '0 (Purine Nucleotides)', 'EC 2.4.2.8 (Hypoxanthine Phosphoribosyltransferase)', 'G9481N71RO (Deoxyguanosine)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Cell Line', 'Deoxyadenosines/pharmacology', 'Deoxyguanosine/pharmacology', 'Deoxyribonucleotides/*metabolism', 'Enzyme Induction', 'Gene Amplification', 'Humans', 'Hypoxanthine Phosphoribosyltransferase/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Molecular Sequence Data', '*Mutation', 'Oligonucleotide Probes', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma', 'Purine Nucleotides/*metabolism', 'T-Lymphocytes', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects/enzymology/*metabolism']",1990/08/01 00:00,1990/08/01 00:01,['1990/08/01 00:00'],"['1990/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 1990 Aug 1;50(15):4566-71.,['CA 34085/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,

Recent studies have suggested that a combination of chemoseparation and immunoseparation may be more effective than either modality alone in eliminating malignant cells from human bone marrow. In this report an immunotoxin has been prepared by conjugating pokeweed antiviral protein (PAP) to the 3A1 murine monoclonal antibody that recognizes a 40 kD (CD7) determinant expressed by most T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemias and a majority of normal mature peripheral T cells. When HSB-2 T lymphoma cells were mixed with normal human bone marrow and incubated with 3A1-PAP and 100 microM chloroquine, approximately 3 logs of clonogenic T cells could be eliminated from a 20-fold excess of bone marrow. Treatment of cell mixtures with 2'deoxycoformycin (2'-dCF) and deoxyadenosine (dAdo) eliminated 2 logs of clonogenic tumor cells. The use of 3A1-PAP and chloroquine with dCF/dAdo was more effective than either single modality, eliminating up to 6 logs of HSB-2 tumor cells in optimal experiments. Anti-tumor activity of the combined treatment extended to T leukemia cells taken directly from patients.

Ten (8%) of 123 culture positive patients developed a fulminant cardiorespiratory collapse, with a 60% mortality. One additional death occurred due to cerebritis. However, a time dependent covariate analysis found no significant difference in overall mortality (p = 0.30) or duration of hospitalization (p = 0.50) in patients with or without viridans streptococci infections. A multivariate analysis revealed that age less than 18 years (RR = 1.5, p = 0.04) and a primary diagnosis of acute lymphocytic leukemia (RR = 1.5, p = 0.07) were independent and significant risk factors for viridans streptococci infections.

In the mouse cell lines, active transport represented only a minor nucleoside transport component and was detected only by measuring formycin B uptake in the presence of dipyridamole or nitrobenzylthioinosine, strong inhibitors of facilitated, but not of active, nucleoside transport. Inhibition of facilitated transport resulted in the concentrative accumulation of formycin B in cells expressing active nucleoside transport. Concentrative formycin B accumulation was abolished by treatment of the cells with gramicidin or absence of Na+ in the extracellular medium and strongly inhibited by ATP depletion or ouabain treatment. Mouse macrophages accumulated formycin B to 70-times the extracellular concentration in the absence of dipyridamole during 90 min of incubation at 37 degrees C. Thus active transport represents a major nucleoside transport system of these cells, similarly as previously reported for mouse spleen lymphocytes. In contrast to the various types of mouse cells, active formycin B transport was not detected in human HeLa cells, human H9, Jurkat and CEM T lymphoidal cells and pig spleen lymphocytes.

Although the mechanism of toxicity is not clear, it is thought to result in part from incorporation of AZT into DNA, which causes chain termination. In order to investigate the mechanism of AZT toxicity, the relationship between the presence of AZT in DNA of K562 cells, a chronic myelogenous leukemia cell line, and growth inhibition was examined. No growth inhibition was evident at less than 50 microM AZT, although incorporation of AZT into DNA was detected at 10 and 20 microM. This suggested that the presence of AZT in DNA was not sufficient to inhibit cell growth. Removal of AZT from the medium resulted in the removal of AZT from DNA of the cells, indicative of a cellular repair mechanism. Cellular DNA polymerases alpha, beta, gamma, and delta from human leukemic cells were inhibited by AZT trisphosphate to different degrees, polymerase alpha being the least potently inhibited. Furthermore, an enzyme with exonucleolytic activity, capable of removing AZT and dideoxycytidine from the correspondingly terminated DNA (in vitro), was obtained from these cells. In summary, AZT was incorporated into DNA at levels that were not toxic, and it could be removed by an exonuclease, which might play a key role in the susceptibility of cells to AZT.","['Vazquez-Padua, M A', 'Starnes, M C', 'Cheng, Y C']","['Vazquez-Padua MA', 'Starnes MC', 'Cheng YC']","['Department of Pharmacology, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, CT 06510.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Commun,Cancer communications,8916730,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '4B9XT59T7S (Zidovudine)', 'EC 2.7.7.7 (DNA-Directed DNA Polymerase)']",IM,"['Biological Transport', 'Biotransformation', 'Cell Line', 'DNA, Neoplasm/*biosynthesis/isolation & purification', 'DNA-Directed DNA Polymerase/isolation & purification/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/*metabolism', 'Zidovudine/*metabolism']",1990/01/01 00:00,1990/01/01 00:01,['1990/01/01 00:00'],"['1990/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Commun. 1990;2(1):55-62. doi: 10.3727/095535490820874740.,"['AI-25697/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-44358/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",['10.3727/095535490820874740 [doi]'],,,,,,,,

The inhibition of ribosomal RNA synthesis was accompanied by rapid declines in the steady-state levels of several, but not all, mRNAs, including gamma-globin mRNA. In this report, we demonstrate that gamma-globin mRNA species were decreased by as much as 40% within 2 hr of exposure to micromolar concentrations of FUrd. The decline in gamma-globin mRNA occurred at a rate that outstripped the normal rate of degradation of this mRNA by a factor of 25. The decline in cytoplasmic mRNA was not mirrored in the nucleus; northern blotting revealed that pre-mRNA levels were not reduced. Nuclease protection analyses of precursors from FUrd treated and untreated control cells did not reveal any qualitative differences. Thus, the decrease was not accounted for by drug-induced inhibition of new gamma-globin mRNA synthesis or misincorporation but must have been due to an FUrd-induced increase in gamma-globin mRNA degradation. Drug-induced instability of RNA was not a generalized feature of FUrd exposure, since neither beta-actin mRNA nor cytoplasmic rRNA, whose stabilities in untreated cells are similar to that of gamma-globin mRNA, were affected. Furthermore, the instability of gamma-globin mRNA did not decrease globin protein levels, presumably because the stability of the protein was not altered. The mechanism by which specific increased degradation of gamma-globin mRNA occurred is unknown, but it may have been due to the activation of cytoplasmic endonuclease.","['Heimer, R', 'Sartorelli, A C']","['Heimer R', 'Sartorelli AC']","['Department of Pharmacology, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, CT 06510.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Commun,Cancer communications,8916730,"['0 (Actins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Ribosomal)', '4K0M952561 (5-fluorouridine)', '9004-22-2 (Globins)', 'WHI7HQ7H85 (Uridine)']",IM,"['Actins/genetics', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Nucleus/drug effects/metabolism', 'Cytosol/metabolism', 'Globins/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute', 'RNA, Messenger/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'RNA, Ribosomal/drug effects/genetics', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Uridine/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology']",1990/01/01 00:00,1990/01/01 00:01,['1990/01/01 00:00'],"['1990/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Commun. 1990;2(1):45-53. doi: 10.3727/095535490820874759.,"['CA-02817/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-09085/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",['10.3727/095535490820874759 [doi]'],,,,,,,,

Administration of IMPY or dAdo/EHNA, alone, at the same doses as in the combination, did not prolong the life-span of tumor bearing mice. To determine the basis for the increased survival due to the sequential treatment with IMPY and dAdo/EHNA, cell cycle analysis and deoxyribonucleoside triphosphate concentrations were measured. Cytotoxicity of IMPY and dAdo/EHNA is known to be achieved through the inhibition of ribonucleotide reductase. IMPY is a specific inhibitor of the nonheme-iron subunit of ribonucleotide reductase, whereas deoxyadenosine in the presence of the adenosine deaminase inhibition, EHNA, is converted to deoxyadenosine 5'-triphosphate (dATP), which is a specific inhibitor of the effector-binding-subunit of ribonucleotide reductase. Our studies showed that L1210 cells accumulated in early S-phase, whereas intracellular dATP and deoxyguanosine triphosphate (dGTP) pools were depleted 8 hr after IMPY administration. dAdo/EHNA administration 8 hr after IMPY injection caused an increase in the intracellular concentration of dATP while maintaining the depletion of the dGTP pool and prolonged the S-phase as compared to the administration of IMPY alone.","['Matsumoto, M', 'Weckbecker, G', 'Cory, J G']","['Matsumoto M', 'Weckbecker G', 'Cory JG']","['Department of Internal Medicine, University of South Florida College of Medicine, H.

The kinetics of this ATP-induced response were studied by measuring 22Na+ influx into chronic lymphocytic leukemic lymphocytes incubated in low-sodium media without divalent cations. ATP-stimulated uptake of 22Na-ions was linear over 4 min incubation and this influx component showed a sigmoid dependence on ATP concentration. Hill analysis yielded a K1/2 of 160 microM and a n value of 2.5. The nucleotide ATP-gamma-S (1-2 mM) gave 30% of the permeability increase produced by ATP, but UTP (2 mM) and dTTP (2 mM) had no effect on 22Na influx. The amiloride analogs 5-(N-ethyl-N-isopropyl) amiloride and 5-(N,N-hexamethylene) amiloride, which are potent inhibitors of Na(+)-H+ countertransport, abolished 72-95% of the ATP-stimulated 22Na+ influx. However, the involvement of Na(+)-H+ countertransport in the ATP-stimulated Na+ influx was excluded by three lines of evidence. Sodium influx was stimulated 7-fold by extracellular ATP but only 2.4-fold by hypertonic conditions which are known to activate Na(+)-H+ countertransport. Addition of ATP to lymphocytes produced no change in intracellular pH when these cells were suspended in isotonic NaCl media. Finally ATP caused a membrane depolarization of lymphocytes which is inconsistent with stimulation of electroneutral Na(+)-H+ exchange. These data suggest that ATP acts cooperatively to induce the formation of membrane channels which allow increased Na+ influx by a pathway which is partially inhibited by amiloride and its analogs.","['Wiley, J S', 'Jamieson, G P', 'Mayger, W', 'Cragoe, E J Jr', 'Jopson, M']","['Wiley JS', 'Jamieson GP', 'Mayger W', 'Cragoe EJ Jr', 'Jopson M']","['Haematology Department, Austin Hospital, Heidelberg, Australia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Arch Biochem Biophys,Archives of biochemistry and biophysics,0372430,"['0 (Thymine Nucleotides)', '1428-95-1 (5-(N,N-hexamethylene)amiloride)', '7DZO8EB0Z3 (Amiloride)', '8L70Q75FXE (Adenosine Triphosphate)', '9NEZ333N27 (Sodium)', ""QOP4K539MU (thymidine 5'-triphosphate)"", 'UT0S826Z60 (Uridine Triphosphate)', 'VW50CE070T (ethylisopropylamiloride)']",IM,"['Adenosine Triphosphate/*pharmacology', 'Amiloride/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Biological Transport/drug effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Humans', 'Hydrogen-Ion Concentration', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/metabolism', 'Lymphocytes/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Membrane Potentials/drug effects', 'Sodium/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Thymine Nucleotides/pharmacology', 'Uridine Triphosphate/pharmacology']",1990/08/01 00:00,2001/03/28 10:01,['1990/08/01 00:00'],"['1990/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1990/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Arch Biochem Biophys. 1990 Aug 1;280(2):263-8. doi: 10.1016/0003-9861(90)90328-v.,,"['0003-9861(90)90328-V [pii]', '10.1016/0003-9861(90)90328-v [doi]']",,,,,,,,

In contrast, PSK did not significantly increase the iodination of other cultured cell lines (U-937, THP-1, L-929, T98G, BALB 3T3). The PSK stimulation of iodination of both PMN and HL-60 cells depended on incubation time and temperature, and was significantly suppressed by the presence of myeloperoxidase inhibitors. Among various PSK subfractions, the highest molecular weight fraction (MW greater than 200 kD), or the fraction precipitated at pH 4.0-4.5, stimulated the iodination most. In contrast, natural and chemically modified glucans had little or no stimulation activity. The active PSK subfractions synergistically enhanced TNF stimulation of PMN iodination.

Five cases were acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL); four were acute nonlymphoblastic leukemia (ANLL). Hyperleukocytosis, hepatosplenomegaly, and poor response to conventional therapy were common features, and CNS involvement was detected at diagnosis in three cases. The blast cells from all five cases with ALL expressed early B-cell markers, i.e., HLA-DR+, CD19+, but CD10-. Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT) was present in blasts from four of the five cases and periodic acid-Schiff staining in blasts from two patients only. The leukemic cells of one patient also showed positive nonspecific esterase activity and expressed myeloid-associated antigens CD33 (My9), CD11 (OkM1), and CD14 (My4 and Mo2). Molecular analysis of leukemic cell DNA from this and two other patients showed rearrangement of the immunoglobulin (Ig) heavy-chain genes, but without any evidence of kappa light-chain gene rearrangement. T-cell receptor (TCR) genes remained in the germline configuration in these cases. Cytogenetic analysis showed translocation t(4;11) (q21;q23) in all four cases studied.

Quinidine enhanced the cytotoxicity of both ADR and MITO in P388/S and P388/ADR cells, as assessed by the decrease in color intensity of formazan crystal in the MTT (3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5 diphenyl tetrazolium bromide) assay. A dose dependent inhibition of 3H-thymidine and 3H-uridine incorporation was observed when the P388/S and P388/ADR cells were exposed to quinidine alone. A non-toxic concentration of quinidine (5 microM) enhanced the DNA biosynthesis inhibition induced by ADR (55 to 65%) and MITO (37 to 44%) in P388/ADR cells, indicating reversal of resistance, while in P388/S cells only a minimal increase in DNA biosynthesis inhibition was observed. The combination of quinidine at doses of 50 to 100 mg/kg significantly potentiated the antitumor activity of ADR and MITO in P388/ADR bearing mice, whereas the potentiation of ADR and MITO antitumor response was lower in P388/S bearing mice. Quinidine increased the cellular levels of ADR by 53 to 126% in P388/ADR cells in vitro, but failed to indicate such elevated levels of cellular ADR in P388/S cells. This enhanced intracellular accumulation of ADR in P388/ADR cells, explains the therapeutic efficacy of ADR and MITO in P388/ADR, both in vitro as well as in vivo. Results suggest the efficacy of quinidine to ameliorate the antitumor effects of ADR and MITO in drug resistant tumor cells.","['Parekh, H', 'Chitnis, M']","['Parekh H', 'Chitnis M']","['Cancer Research Institute, Tata Memorial Center, Bombay, India.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Sel Cancer Ther,Selective cancer therapeutics,8912502,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', 'BZ114NVM5P (Mitoxantrone)', 'ITX08688JL (Quinidine)']",IM,"['Animals', '*Antineoplastic Agents', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'DNA, Neoplasm/biosynthesis', 'Doxorubicin/*pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance', 'Female', 'Leukemia P388/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mitoxantrone/*pharmacology', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Quinidine/*pharmacology']",1990/01/01 00:00,1990/01/01 00:01,['1990/01/01 00:00'],"['1990/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Sel Cancer Ther. 1990 Summer;6(2):93-102. doi: 10.1089/sct.1990.6.93.,,['10.1089/sct.1990.6.93 [doi]'],,,,,,,,

We wished to define the mechanism by which the immune activation of circulating cells from HAM/TSP is driven, thus gaining insight into the pathogenesis of this HTLV-I-associated disease. By using a modification of the polymerase chain reaction, we compared the levels of interleukin 2 (IL-2) and IL-2 receptor alpha chain (IL-2R alpha) mRNA expression to the transcription of the HTLV-I transactivator gene, pX, in peripheral blood mononuclear cells of HAM/TSP and ATL patients as well as seropositive carriers. Up-regulation of IL-2 and IL-2R alpha transcripts was detected in HAM/TSP and seropositive carriers that paralleled the coordinate mRNA expression of the pX transactivator. In addition, IL-2 and soluble IL-2R alpha serum levels in HAM/TSP and seropositive carriers were elevated. Despite markedly elevated levels of soluble IL-2R alpha in ATL, transcripts for IL-2 and pX were not demonstrable in the circulating cells. Finally, the marked degree of in vitro spontaneous proliferation present in HAM/TSP was profoundly inhibited by specific anti-IL-2R or anti-IL-2 blocking antibodies. Collectively, these results suggest that immune activation in HAM/TSP, in contrast to ATL, is virally driven by the transactivation and coordinate expression of IL-2 and IL-2R alpha. This deregulated autocrine process may contribute to the evolution of inflammatory nervous system damage in HAM/TSP.","['Tendler, C L', 'Greenberg, S J', 'Blattner, W A', 'Manns, A', 'Murphy, E', 'Fleisher, T', 'Hanchard, B', 'Morgan, O', 'Burton, J D', 'Nelson, D L']","['Tendler CL', 'Greenberg SJ', 'Blattner WA', 'Manns A', 'Murphy E', 'Fleisher T', 'Hanchard B', 'Morgan O', 'Burton JD', 'Nelson DL', 'et al.']","['Metabolism Branche, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Oligonucleotide Probes)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-2)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Blotting, Southern', 'Female', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*genetics/immunology', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy', 'Interleukin-2/*immunology', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*immunology/therapy', '*Lymphocyte Activation', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Nucleic Acid Hybridization', 'Oligonucleotide Probes', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Receptors, Interleukin-2/*immunology', 'Reference Values', '*Transcriptional Activation']",1990/07/01 00:00,1990/07/01 00:01,['1990/07/01 00:00'],"['1990/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1990 Jul;87(13):5218-22. doi: 10.1073/pnas.87.13.5218.,,['10.1073/pnas.87.13.5218 [doi]'],,PMC54293,,,,,,

The studies of the physicochemical properties and solution stability of pentostatin are important to the development of a parenteral formulation for extensive preclinical and clinical testing. Pentostatin displayed apparent pKa values at 25 +/- 0.1 degree C and ionic strength of 0.15 M of 2.03 +/- 0.03 and 5.57 +/- 0.14 (spectrophotometric) and 5.50 +/- 0.02 (potentiometric) for N1 and the amidine nitrogen in the seven-membered ring, respectively, which are the most likely protonation sites. The rates of degradation of pentostatin were determined as a function of pH, buffer concentration, and temperature. In the pH range 1.0-4.0, pentostatin undergoes acid-catalyzed glycosidic cleavage leading to the formation of the base compound, and 2-deoxyribose. A carbonium ion mechanism in which C-N bond cleavage was the rate-determining step was consistent with the data. In the pH range 6.5-10.5, the imine bond at C5 position in pentostatin is hydrolyzed to form the corresponding formamide. Pentostatin hydrolysis in this pH range was independent of pH. At pH greater than 11, pentostatin decomposes to nonchromophoric products probably through multiple-step base-catalyzed hydrolytic mechanisms.

II. Clinical results in acute leukemia, malignant lymphoma and solid tumors].",53-8,"In this second part of the review the clinical significance of autologous bone marrow transplantation (ABMT) as treatment for acute leukemias (AL) and malignant lymphomas is described. In most adult patients with AL in complete remission treated with conventional maintenance therapy relapse usually occurs within one year. However, the results of ABMT, as an intensive consolidation treatment in patients with AL in remission show long-term disease-free survival in a proportion of 40% of patients. Even better results have been reported in patients with purged bone marrow, although the difference is not statistically significant. A major problem of ABMT is still the high percentage of relapse (50%), while the probability of treatment related mortality is relatively low (up to 10%). ABMT is also showing good results in the treatment of non-Hodgkin's lymphomas of intermediate and high-grade histology and in Hodgkin's disease in cases refractory to the first line therapy and in sensitive relapse. However, in refractory cases the results are poor. It is noteworthy, that in all disorders treated with ABMT, prospective randomised controlled trials are missing and current data are based on heterogenous groups of patients. In the majority of solid tumors, even escalated doses of radiochemotherapy with ABMT are not able to eradicate malignant disease. In contrast, the results are very good in neuroblastoma. Although ABMT is a relatively complex and aggressive method, it is being increasingly applied to the treatment of haematological malignant diseases and the results obtained so far, are encouraging and showing that ABMT, besides allogeneic BMT, represents a promising potentially curative treatment for selected group of patients.","['Nemet, D']",['Nemet D'],"['Zavod za hematologiju, Klinika za unutarnje bolesti s poliklinikom, Klinicki bolnicki centar, Medicinski fakultet Sveucilista u Zagrebu.']",['hrv'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Croatia,Lijec Vjesn,Lijecnicki vjesnik,0074253,,IM,"['Acute Disease', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*surgery', 'Lymphoma/*surgery', 'Neoplasms/*surgery', 'Transplantation, Autologous']",1990/01/01 00:00,1990/01/01 00:01,['1990/01/01 00:00'],"['1990/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Lijec Vjesn. 1990 Jan-Feb;112(1-2):53-8.,,,"Transplantacija autologne kostane srzi--novi pristup lijecenju neoplastickih hematoloskih bolesti.

To identify cells with a potential antileukemic activity post-BMT, we monitored the immunological reconstitution in a patient with chronic phase chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) who received a syngeneic BMT from his identical twin brother. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from the donor prior to the transplant and from the recipient posttransplant were cultured with recombinant interleukin-2 to generate lymphokine activated killer (LAK) cells. LAK cells from both sources lysed the cell line target cells K562 and LCL and also recipient and allogeneic CML target cells in a 51Cr release cytotoxicity assay. Donor-derived LAK cells did not kill normal donor marrow. LAK cells had similar effects on granulocyte-macrophage progenitor cells (CFU-GM): LAK cells from both donor pre-BMT and recipient post-BMT inhibited the proliferation of CFU-GM from the patient's CML cells, but again donor LAK cells did not inhibit the colony growth of normal donor marrow. These results suggest that a syngeneic GVL effect is inducible following BMT in man and that this activity may be truly antileukemic and spare normal marrow progenitors.","['Mackinnon, S', 'Hows, J M', 'Goldman, J M']","['Mackinnon S', 'Hows JM', 'Goldman JM']","['MRC/LRF Leukaemia Unit, Royal Postgraduate Medical School, Hammersmith Hospital, London, U.K.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Antigens, Surface)', '0 (Interleukin-2)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/immunology', 'Antigens, Surface/immunology', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/*immunology', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'Graft vs Host Reaction/*immunology', 'Granulocytes/physiology', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-2/pharmacology', 'Killer Cells, Lymphokine-Activated/immunology', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/blood/immunology/*surgery', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/drug effects/immunology', 'Macrophages/physiology', 'Male', 'Phenotype', 'Transplantation, Isogeneic/*immunology']",1990/04/01 00:00,1990/04/01 00:01,['1990/04/01 00:00'],"['1990/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 1990 Apr;4(4):287-91.,,,,,,,,,,

This discrepancy complicates assessment of the functional value of purged grafts. In 11 patients undergoing autologous bone marrow transplantation with 100 microM Asta-Z purged marrow, we investigated the advantages of the collagen gel culture system for detection of spared hematopoietic progenitors. This technique provides a suitable and convenient assay as compared with results with agar. In nine of 11 samples after 14 or 21 days of incubation, up to 100 colonies were observed, (64% monocytic, 27% granulocytic). Day-14 granulocytic colonies were mostly immature, suggesting that they derived from early CFU-GM or pre-CFU-GM. This development of early progenitors could account for the better sensitivity of this technique compared with agar or methylcellulose systems.

Skin involvement was not documented at presentation, but it was seen as a terminal event in one patient with a pattern of dermal lymphocytic infiltration different from that usually seen in Sezary syndrome. By ultrastructural analysis, the circulating lymphoid cells were indistinguishable from small Sezary cells in two cases, resembled large Sezary cells in one case, and consisted of a mixture of small Sezary cells and prolymphocytes in the remaining case. The cells from all cases had a mature T cell phenotype, TdT-, CD1a-, CD2+/-, CD3+, CD5+. In addition, the cells were either CD8+, CD4- or CD8+, CD4+ or CD4-, CD8-; and, in only one case, the findings were similar to those of Sezary syndrome cells: CD4+, CD8-, CD7-, BE-2+. In the latter case, serological and immunological assays were positive for HTLV-I while these were negative in two other patients investigated. The features of these patients suggest that Sezary cell leukemia is a distinct clinico-pathological entity although the alternative diagnosis of adult T cell leukemia/lymphoma could not be excluded in the HTLV-I+ case.

Hematological examination revealed Hb was 7.3 g/dl, WBC was 89,000/microliters (76% blast), and platelet was 154,000/microliters. His bone marrow was hypercellular and consisted with 91% blasts. Myeloperoxidase staining was positive for 38% of blasts. Auer rods were seen in some of blasts. Thus, the diagnosis was M1 according to FAB classification.

Eighty five percent of blasts expressed HLA-DR and 43% of blasts expressed CD2 and CD13 simultaneously. Thus, this leukemia was considered as the hybrid type of acute mixed leukemia by surface marker analysis.

After 4 courses of post remission chemotherapy, he discharged in December 1985 and was followed at our outpatient clinic without chemotherapy. His disease was relapsed in June 1986, and the combination chemotherapy with mitoxantrone, etoposide and Ara-C was applied to him but failed to attain CR. Then, LVP protocol, the chemotherapy for ALL, was started and CR was achieved. The blasts at relapse had morphologically myeloid features, and expressed HLA-DR, CD2 and CD13 as well as at diagnosis. Cytogenetic studies at relapse showed some karyotype except gaining 12p- anomaly. Therefore, same blasts were considered to emerge at relapse.

We report the risk of cancer other than leukemia among the atomic bomb survivors. We note that the number of excess deaths of radiation-induced malignant tumors other than leukemia increases with age. Survivors who were exposed in the first or second decade of life have just entered the cancer-prone age and have so far exhibited a high relative risk in association with radiation dose. Whether the elevated risk will continue or will fall with time is not yet clear, although some evidence suggests that the risk may be declining. It is important to continue long-term follow-up of this cohort to document the changes with time since exposure and to provide direct rather than projected risks over the lifetime of an exposed individual.","['Shimizu, Y', 'Schull, W J', 'Kato, H']","['Shimizu Y', 'Schull WJ', 'Kato H']","['Department of Epidemiology, Radiation Effects Research Foundation, Hiroshima, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,JAMA,JAMA,7501160,,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Child', 'Cohort Studies', 'Humans', 'Japan/epidemiology', 'Leukemia, Radiation-Induced/epidemiology/etiology/mortality', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced/epidemiology/*etiology/mortality', '*Nuclear Warfare', 'Population Surveillance', 'Radiation Dosage', 'Radiometry', 'Time Factors']",1990/08/01 00:00,1990/08/01 00:01,['1990/08/01 00:00'],"['1990/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,JAMA. 1990 Aug 1;264(5):601-4.,,,,,,,,['JAMA. 1990 Aug 1;264(5):622-3.

Therefore, a case-control study with 1177 individuals who died of leukemia and 5330 other deaths (controls) was conducted using estimates of dose to bone marrow computed from fallout deposition rates and subjects' residence locations. A weak association between bone marrow dose and all types of leukemia, all ages, and all time periods after exposure was found. This overall trend was not statistically significant, but significant trends in excess risk were found in subgroups defined by cell type, age, and time after exposure. The greatest excess risk was found in those individuals in the high-dose group with acute leukemia who were younger than 20 years at exposure and who died before 1964.

BHT markedly accelerated retinoic acid-induced myelocytic differentiation and dihydroxyvitamin D3-induced monocytic differentiation in a concentration and time-dependent manner.

Viridans group streptococci were the most frequent species isolated (45 isolates). Hemolytic streptococci (four isolates), pneumococci (three isolates), and enterococci (three isolates) were infrequent. Clinical features of streptococcal bacteremia included fever, upper and lower respiratory infection, respiratory distress syndrome, soft tissue infection, and septic shock. Forty patients who had only streptococci, but no other organisms isolated from their blood, were compared with 36 cases of gram-negative bacillary bacteremia that occurred during the same study period within the same population at risk. The comparison showed that patients with streptococcal bacteremia had more often received high dose cytosine arabinoside as part of their chemotherapy (17 vs. five), had a longer mean duration of fever (11 vs. seven days, p less than 0.01) needed slightly more days of antibacterial therapy (15 vs. 12 days, p = 0.07, not significant), and were more likely to have been treated with newer quinolones for infection prevention (30 vs. eight).

The overall mortality was 18% in streptococcal bacteremia and 17% in gram-negative bacillary bacteremia.

This receptor, a dimer composed of a 57 kD chain, is also present on some B lymphocytes and activated macrophages (anti-TAC) grouped together in CD25. A soluble form of IL-2R (sIL-2R) was recently identified, comprising the extracellular part of the chain (45 kD) which is released by the cell in body fluids. The presence of sIL-2R in serum can be assayed using ELISA (Cell free, T cell Sciences, Cambridge, MA). Normal values range between 100 and 500 U/ml, with a mean value of 375 U/ml. Marked increases of sIL-2R, with levels of up to 50,000 U/ml, have been observed in various diseases: hairy cell leukemia, Hodgkin's disease, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, acute leukemia, B-CLL, ATL and Sezary's syndrome. Lesser increases are also found in autoimmune diseases, viral infections, and following organ transplantation. Many Authors have described the close correlation between sIL-2R levels and the clinical evolution of the disease. Soluble IL-2 receptors were studied in 184 patients affected by skin diseases: eczematous dermatitis, lichen, psoriasis, erythroderma psoriaticum, dermatomyositis, scleroderma bullous dermatosis, melanoma, Kaposi's disease, lymphomatoid papulosis, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, mycosis fungoides (MF), Sezary's syndrome (SS). Increased serum levels of sIL-R2 were found in non-neoplastic dermatological diseases, including autoimmune related pathologies. Values were normal (396 +/- 170 U/ml) in patients affected by Stage 1 melanoma, but increased (558 +/- 291 U/ml) in cases with visceral involvement.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","['Massobrio, R', 'Lisa, F', 'Novelli, M', 'Bernengo, M G']","['Massobrio R', 'Lisa F', 'Novelli M', 'Bernengo MG']","['Clinica Dermatologica I, Universita di Torino.']",['ita'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Italy,G Ital Dermatol Venereol,"Giornale italiano di dermatologia e venereologia : organo ufficiale, Societa italiana di dermatologia e sifilografia",8102852,"['0 (Receptors, Interleukin-2)']",IM,"['Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Receptors, Interleukin-2/*biosynthesis', 'Skin Diseases/*blood', 'Skin Neoplasms/*blood']",1990/02/01 00:00,1990/02/01 00:01,['1990/02/01 00:00'],"['1990/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,G Ital Dermatol Venereol. 1990 Feb;125(1-2):1-6.,,,Livelli sierici dei recettori solubili dell'interleukina-2 in patologia dermatologica.,,,,,,,

This 60 kDa polypeptide was also immunodetected using the same antibodies in human acute lymphoblastic leukemia cells CEM which are known to express CD4. HT29-D4 cells can be induced to differentiate into enterocyte-like cells by removing glucose from the culture medium. Under these conditions, HT29-D4 cells form a polarized epithelial monolayer in which tight junctions separate the plasma membrane in an apical and a basolateral domain. The localization of CD4 molecules in differentiated HT29-D4 cells was exclusively restricted to the basolateral membrane domain as demonstrated by radioimmunoassay and indirect immunofluorescence studies.

The concentration required for 50% inhibition of growth is 1 ng/ml in the CCRF-CEM human leukemia cell culture assay. Concurrent addition of deoxycytidine to the cell culture system provides about a 1000-fold decrease in biological activity. The inhibition of growth of human leukemia cells in culture led to the in vivo evaluation of this compound as a potential oncolytic agent. Maximal activity in vivo was seen with dFdCyd when administered on an every third day schedule. 1-beta-D-Arabinofuranosylcytosine, administered on a daily for 10-day schedule, was directly compared to dFdCyd in this evaluation. dFdCyd demonstrated good to excellent antitumor activity in eight of the eight murine tumor models evaluated. 1-beta-D-Arabinofuranosylcytosine was substantially less active or had no activity in these same tumor models. This in vivo activity against murine solid tumors supports the conclusion that dFdCyd is an excellent candidate for clinical trials in the treatment of cancer.","['Hertel, L W', 'Boder, G B', 'Kroin, J S', 'Rinzel, S M', 'Poore, G A', 'Todd, G C', 'Grindey, G B']","['Hertel LW', 'Boder GB', 'Kroin JS', 'Rinzel SM', 'Poore GA', 'Todd GC', 'Grindey GB']","['Lilly Research Laboratories, Eli Lilly and Company, Lilly Corporate Center, Indianapolis, Indiana 46285.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0W860991D6 (Deoxycytidine)', 'B76N6SBZ8R (gemcitabine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/*therapeutic use', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Deoxycytidine/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology/therapeutic use/toxicity', 'Drug Evaluation, Preclinical', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Leukemia L1210/*drug therapy', 'Leukemia P388/*drug therapy', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred ICR', 'Mice, Inbred Strains', 'Neoplasms, Experimental/*drug therapy', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/*cytology/drug effects']",1990/07/15 00:00,1990/07/15 00:01,['1990/07/15 00:00'],"['1990/07/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/07/15 00:01 [medline]', '1990/07/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 1990 Jul 15;50(14):4417-22.,,,,,,,,,,

The conjugate was formulated in a micellar solution by sonication, in which the conjugate exists as micellar discs (size, 0.01 to 0.04 micron). Analyses on thin-layer and high-pressure liquid chromatography showed that the conjugate was chemically stable upon storage at 3-4 degrees C for more than a 6-mo period. However, stored at room temperature for 3 mo it began to degrade (3 to 11%) to 1-beta-D-arabinofuranosylcytosine 5'-monophosphate and phosphatidic acid. At 3-4 degrees C, the micellar structure remained generally unchanged for 6 mo (size, less than 0.1 micron). Samples stored for 4 mo at room temperature formed some larger vesicles (size, 0.1 to 0.4 micron). Antitumor activity against i.p. implanted L1210 leukemia in mice remained relatively constant with samples stored for 6 mo at 3-4 degrees C or 3 mo at room temperature. 1-beta-D-Arabinofuranosylcytosine 5'-triphosphate (ara-CTP) levels were elevated (greater than 500 pmol/10(7) cells) in L1210 leukemia cells within 1 h following i.p. administration of 400 mg/kg of ara-CDP-DL-PTBA to mice. More importantly, retention of cellular ara-CTP was prolonged (greater than 24 h) in these tumor cells as compared with ara-C treatments. Administration of ara-CDP-DL-PTBA to mice with colon 26 carcinoma (s.c.) resulted in both significant antitumor activity with an increased life span greater than 100% and decreased tumor size. The conjugate also demonstrated a dose-dependent therapeutic effect in mice with M5076 sarcoma (s.c.) as demonstrated by decreases in tumor size and liver metastases. Overall, ara-CDP-DL-PTBA, a stable lipid conjugate of ara-C in a micellar solution, appears to offer substantial therapeutic benefit to mice with leukemia and solid tumors warranting its further development and clinical investigation.","['Hong, C I', 'Bernacki, R J', 'Hui, S W', 'Rustum, Y', 'West, C R']","['Hong CI', 'Bernacki RJ', 'Hui SW', 'Rustum Y', 'West CR']","['Department of Neurosurgery, Roswell Park Cancer Institute, Buffalo, New York 14263.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Phospholipid Ethers)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '125592-28-1 (ara-CDP-1-S-octadecyl-2-O-palmitoyl-1-thioglycerol)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Colonic Neoplasms/drug therapy', 'Cytarabine/*analogs & derivatives/chemical synthesis/metabolism/therapeutic use', 'Drug Stability', 'Female', 'Freeze Fracturing', 'Leukemia L1210/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Melanoma, Experimental/drug therapy', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Inbred DBA', 'Microscopy, Electron', 'Molecular Structure', 'Neoplasms, Experimental/*drug therapy', 'Phospholipid Ethers/chemical synthesis/*therapeutic use', 'Sarcoma, Experimental/drug therapy']",1990/07/15 00:00,1990/07/15 00:01,['1990/07/15 00:00'],"['1990/07/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/07/15 00:01 [medline]', '1990/07/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 1990 Jul 15;50(14):4401-6.,"['CA 21071/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 42898/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-13038/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,

The stability in vivo of 206Bi chelate-103A conjugates was first evaluated in normal mice by determining the levels of 206Bi in blood and kidney, since these were the organs in which free 206Bi, 206Bi-caDTPA-103A, and 35S-103A accumulated. The biodistribution of 206Bi administered as a chelate of caDTPA-103A was virtually indistinguishable from that of free 206Bi, indicating a low degree of in vivo stability of this bismuth chelate when compared to biosynthetically labeled 35S-103A. There was a progressive increase in the 206Bi levels observed in blood when the series of 103A conjugates prepared using SCNBzDTPA, MxDTPA, and DOTA was compared to 206Bi administered free or as a caDTPA-103A chelate. At 1 h after injection into normal mice, the blood level of 206Bi-DOTA-103A was 25-fold greater than that observed for 206Bi-caDTPA-103A and the level in kidney was 6-fold less, values that did not differ significantly from those observed for 35S-103A. Targeting to leukemic spleen was increased by 10-fold when the DOTA conjugate was used; the tumor level was 90% injected dose/g for DOTA, as compared to only 9% injected dose/g for caDTPA-103A at 1 h after injection. Use of the DOTA chelator also reduced by 7-fold the level of uptake by the kidney in the leukemic animals. We, therefore, conclude that the chelator DOTA is a promising reagent for the delivery of 212Bi-antibody conjugates to vascularized tumors under conditions that require targeting via the circulatory system.","['Ruegg, C L', 'Anderson-Berg, W T', 'Brechbiel, M W', 'Mirzadeh, S', 'Gansow, O A', 'Strand, M']","['Ruegg CL', 'Anderson-Berg WT', 'Brechbiel MW', 'Mirzadeh S', 'Gansow OA', 'Strand M']","['Department of Pharmacology and Molecular Sciences, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, Maryland 21205.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Chelating Agents)', '0 (Radioisotopes)', '0 (Sulfur Radioisotopes)', 'U015TT5I8H (Bismuth)']",IM,"['Animals', '*Antibodies, Monoclonal', '*Bismuth/pharmacokinetics', 'Chelating Agents', 'Female', 'Hybridomas/immunology', 'Kidney/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Experimental/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', '*Radioisotopes', 'Spleen/metabolism', 'Sulfur Radioisotopes', 'Tissue Distribution']",1990/07/15 00:00,1990/07/15 00:01,['1990/07/15 00:00'],"['1990/07/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/07/15 00:01 [medline]', '1990/07/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 1990 Jul 15;50(14):4221-6.,['CA-33470/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,

Median age was 60 years and the M:F ratio was 0.69. At diagnosis, 53 patients were asymptomatic; 50 patients had functional symptoms (mainly vasomotor disturbances); 27 patients had large vessel thrombosis; 27 patients had a bleeding diathesis; and seven patients had both bleeding and thrombosis. The platelet count ranged from 0.7 to 2.92 X 10(12)/l. Forty-five of the 61 tested patients (61%) had prolonged bleeding time and/or platelet hypoaggregation. Three patients had in vitro spontaneous aggregation. No significant correlations were found between hemostatic findings and in vivo bleeding or thrombosis. The incidence of bleeding, however, was higher in patients with more than 2 x 10(12)/l platelets. Of 87 karyotypes performed with banding techniques, only four were abnormal. One hundred twenty-nine patients received one or more cytoreductive agents at diagnosis or during follow-up. Sixty patients received an antiaggregating agent. First-line therapy was radiophosphorus (32P) in 22 patients; busulfan in 35 patients; and hydroxyurea in 72 patients. Hydroxyurea required continuous maintenance therapy and had to be changed to another treatment in 12 of the initial responders because of inadequate control of thrombocythemia. During follow-up, 14 treated patients experienced one or several major thrombotic events. Two untreated patients also had major thrombosis. Only one major bleeding event was seen during follow-up. Median actuarial survival was 73.5% at 7 years and only one patient progressed to acute non-lymphocytic leukemia (ANLL). These results suggest that large vessel thrombosis is the main complication of ET. It appears largely unpredictable in a given patient at diagnosis but can be largely prevented by the control of thrombocythemia. Because of the low incidence of side effects of treatment in this experience, the authors believe that cytoreductive therapy is indicated in most patients with ET, as long as a group of patients with very low risk of thrombosis is not defined in prospective studies.","['Fenaux, P', 'Simon, M', 'Caulier, M T', 'Lai, J L', 'Goudemand, J', 'Bauters, F']","['Fenaux P', 'Simon M', 'Caulier MT', 'Lai JL', 'Goudemand J', 'Bauters F']","['Service des Maladies du Sang, C.H.U., Lille, France.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Remission Induction', '*Thrombocythemia, Essential/blood/complications/drug therapy/physiopathology', 'Thrombosis/etiology']",1990/08/01 00:00,1990/08/01 00:01,['1990/08/01 00:00'],"['1990/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer. 1990 Aug 1;66(3):549-56. doi: 10.1002/1097-0142(19900801)66:3<549::aid-cncr2820660324>3.0.co;2-6.,,['10.1002/1097-0142(19900801)66:3<549::aid-cncr2820660324>3.0.co;2-6 [doi]'],,,,,,,,

Results of a pilot trial.,447-50,"With the introduction of effective prophylactic central nervous system (CNS) therapy in childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), the incidence of CNS relapse has been significantly reduced. Nonetheless, there is a continuing need for effective CNS therapy for the 5% to 10% of children who escape prophylaxis and in whom active CNS disease develops. In July 1985, a pilot study was initiated whereby the consolidative CNS treatment, given in the form of craniospinal axis radiation, was delayed and administered after delivery of a prolonged course of intensive systemic and CNS chemotherapy. Ten leukemic patients with CNS relapse were treated according to this pilot study. One patient did not respond to pre-CNS consolidative therapy and died at 2 months with progressive disease. The remaining nine patients have completed the craniospinal axis radiation. Five patients are off all therapy and remain in remission at a median time of 38 months (range, 31 to 46 months). Two patients are near completion of therapy and are disease-free at 22 and 24 months. Testicular relapse occurred in two patients at 14 and 29 months. CNS chemotherapy, as used in this trial, appears to have allowed for a delay in the administration of the consolidative craniospinal radiation without negatively affecting the CNS remission rate or duration. In turn, this delay has allowed for the uncompromised delivery of intensive multiagent systemic chemotherapy, as well as the separation of those patients destined to early systemic relapse from those who will achieve a sustained complete remission. In both cases, a reduction in the need for multiple courses of potentially toxic CNS therapy as a result of CNS reseeding after radiation is anticipated.","['Mandell, L R', 'Steinherz, P', 'Fuks, Z']","['Mandell LR', 'Steinherz P', 'Fuks Z']","['Department of Radiation Oncology, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Brain Neoplasms/*prevention & control', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Evaluation Studies as Topic', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Pilot Projects', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/*prevention & control/radiotherapy', 'Remission Induction', 'Time Factors']",1990/08/01 00:00,1990/08/01 00:01,['1990/08/01 00:00'],"['1990/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer. 1990 Aug 1;66(3):447-50. doi: 10.1002/1097-0142(19900801)66:3<447::aid-cncr2820660308>3.0.co;2-5.,,['10.1002/1097-0142(19900801)66:3<447::aid-cncr2820660308>3.0.co;2-5 [doi]'],,,,,,,,

HCL-V cells had a mature B-cell phenotype: CD19+, CD20+, CD22+, FMC7+, CD11c+, CD10-, CD5-, with light chain isotope restriction in 15 cases. In contrast to typical hairy cells, HCL-V cells were negative with the monoclonal antibodies anti-HC2 and anti-TAC (CD25). Immunoglobulin (Ig) was not detected in two cases and IgG was expressed in the cell membrane of 73% of cases. Bone marrow histology was different from HCL, showing interstitial infiltration by cells clumped together and a moderate amount of reticulin, but the spleen showed the typical red pulp expansion of HCL. HCL-V patients did not respond to splenectomy (5 of 7) or alpha-interferon (7 of 7); 2 of 3 patients had a partial response to 2'deoxycoformycin.

Ten children, representing 2.3% of the entire cohort, had this abnormality (1.5% of ALL patients and 4.8% of ANLL patients).

Leukemic cells from 5 of these 6 cases (4 ANLL, and 1 ALL) coexpressed CD13, a myeloid-associated antigen, and CD2, a T-cell-associated antigen; blasts from the sixth case (ALL) coexpressed CD13 and CD19, a B-lineage-associated antigen. Thus, in addition to the well-described 11q23 translocations and t(9;22), 14q32 translocations also appear to be associated with mixed lineage antigen expression. Break-points of the reciprocal chromosomes from chromosome 14 were identified in five of these cases: 1q23, 6q23-q25, 7p15, 8q11, and 12q13. Of the four mixed-lineage cases that were tested, none showed rearrangement of the immunoglobulin heavy chain (IgH) gene.

Among the 285 pre-B cases in which bone marrow was studied cytogenetically, those with t(1;19) had a significantly worse treatment outcome than all others (11 of 29 v 27 of 256 have failed therapy, P less than .001). This difference is significant (P less than .001) after adjustment for leukocyte count, age, and other relevant features. Cases with the t(1;19) also had a worse prognosis than pre-B patients with other translocations (4 of 37 have failed, P less than .01) or with any other karyotypic abnormality (7 of 101 have failed, P less than .001). We conclude that chromosomal translocations confer a worse prognosis for non-T, non-B-cell childhood ALL, and that the t(1;19) is largely responsible for the poor prognosis of the pre-B subgroup.","['Crist, W M', 'Carroll, A J', 'Shuster, J J', 'Behm, F G', 'Whitehead, M', 'Vietti, T J', 'Look, A T', 'Mahoney, D', 'Ragab, A', 'Pullen, D J']","['Crist WM', 'Carroll AJ', 'Shuster JJ', 'Behm FG', 'Whitehead M', 'Vietti TJ', 'Look AT', 'Mahoney D', 'Ragab A', 'Pullen DJ', 'et al.']","[""St Jude Children's Research Hospital.""]",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,,IM,"['B-Lymphocytes/pathology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 1', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 19', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Male', 'Phenotype', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics/pathology', 'Prognosis', 'Stem Cells/pathology', '*Translocation, Genetic']",1990/07/01 00:00,1990/07/01 00:01,['1990/07/01 00:00'],"['1990/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 1990 Jul 1;76(1):117-22.,"['CA 21765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 25408/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 31566/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",['S0006-4971(20)84267-0 [pii]'],,,,,,,,

We demonstrated that soluble CD9 antigen was shed into CSF obtained from children with ALL, using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), which used the activity of CD9 antigen to bind the Ricinus communis agglutinin (RCA1) and a monoclonal antibody, SJ-9A4, simultaneously. Using RCA1/SJ-9A4 ELISA, CD9 antigen was detectable in CSF but not in plasma from 12 cases of CD9+ ALL in central nervous system (CNS) relapse. However, CD9 antigen was not released into CSF from 11 cases of CD9- ALL with CNS involvement, 136 cases of CD9+ ALL in complete remission (CR), 29 cases of CD9- ALL in CR, or 21 cases of aseptic meningitis. Interestingly, the levels of CD9 antigen were elevated in CSF from 7 of 10 CD9+ ALL patients without cytologically proven CNS involvement at diagnosis, with subsequent return to undetectable levels after initial induction chemotherapy was begun. In addition, sequential analysis of CSF from a 5-year-old boy with CD9+ ALL in CNS relapse showed that levels of CD9 antigen correlated well with the number of leukemic cells in CSF. Serial quantitative analysis of CD9 antigen in CSF could be useful to detect the proliferation of residual leukemic cells before the clinical manifestation.","['Komada, Y', 'Ochiai, H', 'Shimizu, K', 'Azuma, E', 'Kamiya, H', 'Sakurai, M']","['Komada Y', 'Ochiai H', 'Shimizu K', 'Azuma E', 'Kamiya H', 'Sakurai M']","['Department of Pediatrics, Mie University School of Medicine, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation)', '0 (CD9 protein, human)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Tetraspanin 29)']",IM,"['Antibody Specificity', '*Antigens, CD', 'Antigens, Differentiation/*cerebrospinal fluid/immunology', 'Central Nervous System/pathology', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Humans', '*Membrane Glycoproteins', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/cerebrospinal fluid/immunology/*pathology', 'Tetraspanin 29']",1990/07/01 00:00,1990/07/01 00:01,['1990/07/01 00:00'],"['1990/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 1990 Jul 1;76(1):112-6.,,['S0006-4971(20)84266-9 [pii]'],,,,,,,,

The time trend for survival of females was not significant. There were highly significant (p less than 0.001) positive time trends for prevalences of leukemia, anterior pituitary tumors and thyroid C-cell tumors in both sexes, adrenal pheochromocytomas in males and mammary tumors and endometrial stromal polyps in females.

Histological reevaluation of tumor prevalences in approximately 250 rats of each sex at each of 4 different time periods indicated that changes in diagnostic criteria may have contributed to but could not totally explain the increased prevalence of leukemia. Changes in diagnostic criteria and the amount of tissue examined may have contributed to the increased prevalence of anterior pituitary tumors in both sexes and adrenal pheochromocytomas in males.

It should be emphasized, however, that mass screening programs of any kind have to be evaluated by means of benefit-risk analysis and cost-effectiveness analysis. This is the first report on the benefit-risk analysis for mass screening program of lung cancer in Japan. The benefit of the lung cancer mass screening is defined as a net elongation of average life expectancy due to early detection of the cancer. It is calculated as a function of age and sex. While, the risk of the screening program is defined as a net shortage of average life expectancy due to radiation carcinogenesis of leukemia and lung cancer. In the case of radiation carcinogenesis, latent time and plateau period are considered in the calculation of the risk. Since the benefit increases with age and the risk decreases with age for both sexes, one can obtain a certain age at which the benefit and the risk cross. Assuming dose equivalent of lung of 1 mSv and risk coefficient of 15.1 X 10(-3) Sv-1, the crossing ages of men and women are about 42 y.o. and 47 y.o. respectively. We consider that these ages are rather high when chest radiograph is to be used as a screening test.

The first is a series of 10-propargyl-5,8-dideazafolic acid derivatives (10a-j) and the second is a series of the analogous 2-desamino derivatives (13a-c,k), both bearing a more lipophilic substituent on the phenyl ring than the CO-glutamate of classical antifolates. Compounds 10a-j were prepared in a straightforward manner, generally by treatment of N-[6-(bromomethyl)-3,4-dihydro-4-oxo-2-quinazolinyl]-2,2-dimethylprop anamide (6) with various phenyl-substituted N-propargylanilines (8), followed by deprotection. Compounds 13a-c,k were prepared similarly from [6-(bromomethyl)-4-oxo-3(4H)-quinazolinyl] methyl 2,2-dimethylpropanoate (11). The compounds were tested for inhibition of purified L1210 TS and for inhibition of L1210 cell growth in vitro. Several of these nonclassical analogues approached the TS inhibitory potency of 10-propargyl-5,8-dideazafolic acid (1, CB3717), a glutamate-containing TS inhibitor. 2-Amino target compounds 10a-j were generally potent inhibitors of L1210 TS, with IC50s within the range of 0.51-11.5 microM, compared to 0.05 microM for 1. The order of potency for phenyl substitution at the 4-position in this series was the following: COCF3 greater than or equal to NO2 greater than or equal to CONH2 greater than or equal to COCH3 greater than SO2NMe2 greater than CN much greater than OCF3 greater than or equal to F. The 2-desamino target compounds 13a-c,k also exhibited significant, although diminished, TS inhibition. Both series were growth inhibitory to cells in tissue culture and this inhibition could be reversed by thymidine alone, indicating that the primary target was TS. None of the compounds was a potent inhibitor of dihydrofolate reductase. These studies indicate that the presence of the glutamate moiety in folate analogues is not an absolute requirement for potent inhibition of TS.","['McNamara, D J', 'Berman, E M', 'Fry, D W', 'Werbel, L M']","['McNamara DJ', 'Berman EM', 'Fry DW', 'Werbel LM']","['Department of Chemistry, Parke-Davis Pharmaceutical Research Division, Warner-Lambert Company, Ann Arbor, Michigan 48105.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,J Med Chem,Journal of medicinal chemistry,9716531,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Folic Acid Antagonists)', '0 (Indicators and Reagents)', '0 (Quinazolines)', 'EC 2.1.1.45 (Thymidylate Synthase)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*chemical synthesis/pharmacology', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*chemical synthesis/pharmacology', '*Folic Acid Antagonists', 'Humans', 'Indicators and Reagents', 'Leukemia L1210/enzymology', 'Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy', 'Molecular Structure', 'Quinazolines/*chemical synthesis/pharmacology', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Thymidylate Synthase/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/cytology/drug effects/enzymology']",1990/07/01 00:00,1990/07/01 00:01,['1990/07/01 00:00'],"['1990/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Med Chem. 1990 Jul;33(7):2045-51. doi: 10.1021/jm00169a040.,,['10.1021/jm00169a040 [doi]'],,,,,,,,

In one of the earliest studies on MDR, Biedler and Riehm in an attempt to explain the cross-resistance profile of actinomycin D resistant Chinese hamster cells suggested that molecular weight was an important determinant. Our statistical analysis of their data validates their claim and indeed strongly demonstrates that cross resistance is enhanced by the increased size and hydrophobicity of the antitumor agent. Our preliminary studies with methotrexate-resistant L1210 cells indicates that cross resistance is increased in the case of moderate-sized, hydrophilic drugs.

Since post-rearrangement deletion, point mutation, and heavy chain switching occur in heavy chain genes, but are seldom seen in light chain genes, it is important to analyze both heavy and light chain genes to conclusively determine clonal origin.","['Sun, T', 'Susin, M', 'Desner, M', 'Pergolizzi, R', 'Cuomo, J', 'Koduru, P']","['Sun T', 'Susin M', 'Desner M', 'Pergolizzi R', 'Cuomo J', 'Koduru P']","['Department of Laboratories, North Shore University Hospital, Manhasset, NY 11030.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",United States,Hum Pathol,Human pathology,9421547,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Immunoglobulins)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD/analysis', 'Blotting, Southern', 'Gene Rearrangement', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulins/analysis', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/genetics/metabolism/*pathology', 'Lymph Nodes/pathology', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/genetics/metabolism/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Syndrome']",1990/07/01 00:00,1990/07/01 00:01,['1990/07/01 00:00'],"['1990/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Hum Pathol. 1990 Jul;21(7):722-8. doi: 10.1016/0046-8177(90)90032-z.,,"['0046-8177(90)90032-Z [pii]', '10.1016/0046-8177(90)90032-z [doi]']",,,,,,,,

Pharmacokinetic parameters and dosages were determined by linear regression analysis of a one-compartment model by the method of Sawchuk et al. (R. J. Sawchuk, D. E. Zaske, R. J. Cippolle, W. A. Wargin, and R. G. Strate, Clin. Pharmacol. Ther. 21:362-369, 1976). Significant differences between the study and control groups were found for aminoglycoside volume of distribution (0.40 +/- 0.1 versus 0.27 +/- 0.05 liter/kg [mean +/- standard deviation], respectively; P less than 0.0001), clearance (116.6 +/- 48.9 versus 68.6 +/- 26.7 ml/min, respectively; P less than 0.0001), half-life (2.27 +/- 0.66 versus 3.5 +/- 1.8 h, respectively; P less than 0.0001), and elimination rate constant (0.33 +/- 0.11 versus 0.24 +/- 0.09 h-1, respectively; P less than 0.001). The percentage of bone marrow blast cells (at the time of diagnosis) in patients with acute leukemia significantly correlated with increased aminoglycoside clearance (R2 = 36.98%; P = 0.0001). Patients with stage IV lymphomas (Hodgkins disease and non-Hodgkins lymphoma) had a significantly increased clearance compared with patients with lower stages of lymphomas (105.1 +/- 18.5 versus 84.1 +/- 14.9 ml/min; P = 0.014). Fever, leukocyte count, or chemotherapy, among other clinical and laboratory parameters that were studied, had no significant correlation or effect on aminoglycoside disposition. The average dose of amikacin required to maintain peak concentrations in serum above 20 micrograms/ml in patients with a hematologic malignancy was 27.5 +/- 8.43 mg/kg per day. Pharmacokinetic parameters and dosages for the control patients were comparable to general literature standards. we conclude that the dosages recommended by the manufacturers or those derived from nomograms underestimate the aminoglycoside volume of distribution and clearance in patients with a hematologic malignancy and result in suboptimal peak aminoglycoside concentrations in serum. We recommend that in febrile neutropenic patients with an underlying hematologic malignancy, amikacin be initiated at 7.5 to 10 mg/kg per dose every 8 h (2 to 2.5 mg/kg per dose every 8 h for gentamicin) and adjusted within 24 h based on individual pharmacokinetic analysis.","['Zeitany, R G', 'El Saghir, N S', 'Santhosh-Kumar, C R', 'Sigmon, M A']","['Zeitany RG', 'El Saghir NS', 'Santhosh-Kumar CR', 'Sigmon MA']","['Department of Clinical Pharmacy, King Khalid University Hospital, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Antimicrob Agents Chemother,Antimicrobial agents and chemotherapy,0315061,"['0 (Aminoglycosides)', '0 (Anti-Bacterial Agents)', 'AYI8EX34EU (Creatinine)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aminoglycosides', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents/*administration & dosage/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics', 'Bacterial Infections/drug therapy/etiology', 'Creatinine/blood', 'Female', 'Half-Life', 'Humans', 'Kidney Diseases/chemically induced', 'Leukemia/*complications', 'Male', 'Middle Aged']",1990/05/01 00:00,1990/05/01 00:01,['1990/05/01 00:00'],"['1990/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Antimicrob Agents Chemother. 1990 May;34(5):702-8. doi: 10.1128/AAC.34.5.702.,,['10.1128/AAC.34.5.702 [doi]'],,PMC171677,,,,,,

The authors compared the initial morphologic characteristics of B-cell lymphomas and leukemias in uniformly plastic-embedded biopsies of lymph nodes and bone marrow, using the Kiel classification and International Working Formulation (WF). Fifteen of 48 cases with multiple positive biopsies showed major differences, with 9 cases resulting in a discrepant malignancy grade. A discordant low grade was found in the bone marrow of seven cases. Two patients with rapidly progressive bone marrow insufficiency had a reversed pattern. One patient with a composite lymphoma also had disseminated high-grade lymphoma. In 4 of 22 patients with a follicle center cell lymphoma, bone marrow histologic characteristics suggested immunocytoma. The available data suggest that most differences between bone marrow and lymph node biopsies are caused by tumor heterogeneity.

The estimated life risk for an HTLV-I carrier to develop ATLL is approximately 5%. The major transmission pathway of HTLV-I peculiarly endemic in the Nagasaki Prefecture was studied. The prevalence of HTLV-I infection in children of carrier mothers (21%) was significantly higher than that in children in the general population in the area (1%) and more than 85% of mothers of carrier children were carriers. The breast milk of carrier mothers contained HTLV-I-infected cells and was infectious for marmoset via oral administration. A retrospective survey of children of carrier mothers showed that the prevalence of carrier children of carrier mothers was 17 (39%) of 44 and 0 (0%) of 10 when they were given breast milk only or formula only, respectively. These data provide a powerful basis for devising an intervention measure to block the endemic cycle of HTLV-I, ie, if carrier mothers refrain from breast-feeding, the incidence of ATLL will be significantly reduced some 50 years later.","['Tsuji, Y', 'Doi, H', 'Yamabe, T', 'Ishimaru, T', 'Miyamoto, T', 'Hino, S']","['Tsuji Y', 'Doi H', 'Yamabe T', 'Ishimaru T', 'Miyamoto T', 'Hino S']","['Department of Pediatrics, Nagasaki University School of Medicine, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,Pediatrics,Pediatrics,0376422,['0 (HTLV-I Antibodies)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Breast Feeding', 'Carrier State/epidemiology/transmission', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'HTLV-I Antibodies/blood', 'HTLV-I Infections/epidemiology/*prevention & control/transmission', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Japan/epidemiology', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/epidemiology/prevention & control/transmission', 'Pregnancy', 'Prevalence', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Seroepidemiologic Studies', 'Urban Population/statistics & numerical data']",1990/07/01 00:00,1990/07/01 00:01,['1990/07/01 00:00'],"['1990/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Pediatrics. 1990 Jul;86(1):11-7.,,,,,,,,,,

On a molar basis, acetaldoifosphamide was 8-10 times more potent than 4-HC against two different human leukemic myeloid cell lines, but only twice as potent as 4-HC against normal bone marrow granulocyte-macrophage colony-forming cells (GM-CFC). Acetaldoifosphamide retained its activity against leukemic cell lines that were highly resistant to the antileukemic drugs doxorubicin and m-AMSA. GM-CFC doubling times after exposure of bone marrow to high concentrations of acetaldoifosphamide in suspension cultures were 6-12 hours. Similar doubling times were obtained after incubation of marrow with 4-HC. Acetaldoifosphamide has a sparing effect on hematopoietic stem cells that is similar to that found for 4-HC; however, it is considerably more potent than 4-HC. Acetaldoifosphamide is different from 4-HC in its chemical stability and its unique requirement for carboxylate esterase activation.

Bone marrow blast cells were grown in suspension cultures in the presence of 500 U/ml (62 ng/ml) of TNF-alpha for 7 days. Induction of differentiation was assessed by means of morphology, cytochemistry, immunophenotyping (CD11b, CD13, CD14, CD33), and nitroblue tetrazolium reduction. In all cases, exposure of leukemic blasts to TNF-alpha resulted in phenotypic changes consistent with induction of differentiation, although a marked variability in degree and type of response was observed. The majority of cases developed monocytic morphology and showed significant increases (chi 2 test, p less than 0.05) in phagocytic activity and/or expression of ANAE and myelomonocytic differentiation antigens (CD11b, CD14). TNF-alpha reduced c-myc mRNA level over a period of 24 hr in four of six cases studied: the two cases with no down-regulation were the least responsive in terms of myelomonocytic differentiation. These results confirm those obtained with leukemic cell lines, suggesting that TNF-alpha can induce differentiation of fresh AML blasts, mainly toward the monocytic lineage, and that induction of differentiation seems to be closely linked to down-regulation of c-myc mRNA expression over the first 24 hr rather than to attenuation of cellular proliferation per se.","['Bergamaschi, G', 'Carlo-Stella, C', 'Cazzola, M', 'De Fazio, P', 'Pedrazzoli, P', 'Peverali, F A', 'Della Valle, G']","['Bergamaschi G', 'Carlo-Stella C', 'Cazzola M', 'De Fazio P', 'Pedrazzoli P', 'Peverali FA', 'Della Valle G']","['Dipartimento di Medicina Interna e Terapia Medica, University of Pavia, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)']",IM,"['Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Chi-Square Distribution', '*Down-Regulation', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Monocytes/*pathology', '*Proto-Oncogenes', 'RNA, Messenger/*genetics/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/metabolism/pathology', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/*pharmacology']",1990/06/01 00:00,1990/06/01 00:01,['1990/06/01 00:00'],"['1990/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 1990 Jun;4(6):426-30.,,,,,,,,,,

The detected TdT+ cells were studied in detail by use of double marker analyses for TdT and differentiation markers, such as myeloid markers (CD13 and CD33), B cell markers, T cell markers, and the precursor antigen CD34. In 15 (25%) of these leukemic cell samples, we found no TdT+ cells or low percentages of CD10+TdT+ cells; the latter probably represent precursor B cells. In the other 45 (75%) ANLL myeloid marker+TdT+ CD10- cells were detected, ranging from 0.1-10% (n = 24) or over 10% (n = 21) of mononuclear cells. Interestingly, a higher frequency of CD34 positivity was found on the TdT+ cells as compared to the TdT- cells, suggesting that the TdT+ cells represent an immature leukemic subpopulation. Therefore, it may be speculated that the TdT+ subpopulation contains the clonogenic ANLL cells. In two patients, in whom immunologic marker analysis was performed at initial diagnosis as well as at relapse, an expansion of the TdT+ subpopulation was documented at relapse, which may reflect a reduced differentiation capacity of the leukemic cells. Previous studies on a series of nonleukemic bone marrow and blood samples revealed that normal counterparts of myeloid marker+TdT+ cells are rare in bone marrow (less than 0.03%, if they occur at all) and that such cells are not detectable in blood. Therefore myeloid marker TdT double stainings may be useful to monitor the TdT+ leukemic subpopulation in patients with a TdT+ ANLL during and after chemotherapy. Our preliminary results on the follow-up of two such patients support this hypothesis.","['Adriaansen, H J', 'van Dongen, J J', 'Kappers-Klunne, M C', 'Hahlen, K', ""van 't Veer, M B"", 'Wijdenes-de Bresser, J H', 'Holdrinet, A C', 'Harthoorn-Lasthuizen, E J', 'Abels, J', 'Hooijkaas, H']","['Adriaansen HJ', 'van Dongen JJ', 'Kappers-Klunne MC', 'Hahlen K', ""van 't Veer MB"", 'Wijdenes-de Bresser JH', 'Holdrinet AC', 'Harthoorn-Lasthuizen EJ', 'Abels J', 'Hooijkaas H']","['Department of Immunology, University Hospital Dijkzigt/Erasmus University, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antigens, Differentiation, Myelomonocytic)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', 'EC 2.7.7.31 (DNA Nucleotidylexotransferase)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antigens, Differentiation, Myelomonocytic/analysis', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*analysis/blood', 'Bone Marrow/enzymology/immunology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', '*Clinical Enzyme Tests', 'DNA Nucleotidylexotransferase/*analysis/blood', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*diagnosis/immunology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Recurrence']",1990/06/01 00:00,1990/06/01 00:01,['1990/06/01 00:00'],"['1990/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 1990 Jun;4(6):404-10.,,,,,,,,,,

Experiments performed with mouse L1210 leukemia growing in culture show that each antagonist has different sites of inhibition in nucleotide biosynthesis. Acivicin is a potent inhibitor of CTP and GMP synthetases and partially inhibits N-formylglycineamidine ribotide (FGAM) synthetase of purine biosynthesis. DON inhibits FGAM synthetase, CTP synthetase, and glucosamine-6-phosphate isomerase. Azaserine inhibits FGAM synthetase and glucosamine-6-phosphate isomerase. Large accumulations of FGAR and its di- and triphosphate derivatives were observed for all three antagonists which could interfere with the biosynthesis of nucleic acids, providing another mechanism of cytotoxicity. Acivicin, azaserine, and DON are not potent inhibitors of carbamyl phosphate synthetase II (glutamine-hydrolyzing) and amidophosphoribosyltransferase in leukemia cells growing in culture although there are reports of such inhibitions in vitro.

The activity was purified from an immature T-cell acute leukemic tumor cell line, with the majority of enrichment obtained by chromatography on a novel Z-DNA affinity column. The human homologous pairing protein was found to absolutely require homologous DNA substrates in a reaction that needs nearly stoichiometric amounts of protein. The homologous pairing activity is not stimulated by addition of exogenous ATP; however, the photo-cross-linking ATP analog 8-azidoadenosine 5'-[32P] triphosphate (8-N3-[32P]ATP) binds specifically to the homologous pairing protein. Electron microscopic analysis demonstrated the formation of all expected products. Intermediate strand-exchange products were shown to conserve the displaced DNA strands, eliminating many alternate explanations for the homologous pairing activity.

Using transgenic mice and MEL cells the functional part of this region was further mapped to a 300 bp central core, which provides position independent, high level expression. It contains a number of ubiquitous and erythroid specific protein binding sites, including the previously described factors NF-E1 (GF1) and NF-E2. The latter binds to a dimer of the consensus binding sequence for jun/fos. The presence of this sequence is required for the function of the element, but single or multimerized copies of this site failed to give position independent, high levels of expression in transgenic mice or MEL cells.

Seventy-three patients with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) and acute non-lymphoblastic leukaemia (ANLL) with untreated or relapsed disease had a median activity of 2.4% (range 0-13.4) (P less than 0.001), while 57 patients who had achieved complete remission had a median activity of 22.7% (range 9.5-64.4). In 15 patients, reductions of NKA were seen prior to 16 episodes of relapse.

The median NKA of the group prior to the drop in activity was 25.5% and the median first low value was 6.0%. Five patients who relapsed after allogeneic bone marrow transplantation had significant, sustained drops in NKA, 5-9 weeks earlier.

Nevertheless, the total regression of initial tumors and the absence of further tumor incidence (greater than 180 days) was confirmed by autopsy in 5%-10% of the C3H/StRos mice receiving multiple i.p. injections of 5 or 7.5 mg/kg PTT.119. The drug was highly effective against spontaneous AKR leukemia; multiple s.c. or i.p. injections for a total of 15-40 mg/kg PTT.119 increased the average 25-day life span up to 723% and sustained remission in 9%-40% of the animals for greater than 6 months.","['Yagi, M J', 'Bekesi, J G']","['Yagi MJ', 'Bekesi JG']","['Department of Neoplastic Diseases, Mount Sinai School of Medicine, City University of New York, NY 10029.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Germany,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol,Cancer chemotherapy and pharmacology,7806519,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Nitrogen Mustard Compounds)', 'IB1H345F24 (ambamustine)']",IM,"['Adenocarcinoma/*drug therapy/mortality', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Female', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy/mortality', 'Leukemia L1210/*drug therapy/mortality', 'Mammary Neoplasms, Animal/*drug therapy/mortality', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred Strains', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Nitrogen Mustard Compounds/*therapeutic use', 'Osteosarcoma/*drug therapy/mortality', 'Remission Induction']",1990/01/01 00:00,1990/01/01 00:01,['1990/01/01 00:00'],"['1990/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol. 1990;26(3):215-20. doi: 10.1007/BF02897202.,['5P-30CA-23102/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],['10.1007/BF02897202 [doi]'],,,,,,,,

This in vivo assay measures the effects of chemical treatment on neoplastic progression in transplant recipients. Chemicals were given ad libitum in the drinking water simultaneously with the transplants and continued throughout the study. In all, 20 million leukemic cells were injected s.c. into syngeneic rats, which after 60 days resulted in a 10-fold increase in relative spleen weights, a 100-fold increase in white blood cell counts, and a 50% reduction in red blood cell (RBC) indices and platelet counts. At this interval, ethylene glycol monomethyl ether (2-ME) given at a dose of 2.5 mg/ml in the drinking water completely eliminated all clinical, morphological, and histopathological evidence of leukemia, whereas the same dose of ethylene glycol monoethyl ether (2-EE) reduced these responses by about 50%. Seven of the glycol ethers were ineffective as anti-leukemic agents, including ethylene glycol, the monopropyl, monobutyl, and monophenyl ethylene glycol ethers, diethylene glycol, and the monomethyl and monoethyl diethylene glycol ethers. 2-ME more than doubled the latency period of leukemia expression and extended survival for at least 210 days. A minimal effective dose for a 50% reduction in the leukemic responses was 0.25 mg/ml 2-ME in the drinking water (15 mg/kg body weight), whereas a 10-fold higher dose of 2-EE was required for equivalent antileukemic activity. In addition, the in vitro exposure of a leukemic spleen mononuclear cell culture to 2-ME caused a dose- and time-dependent reduction in the number of leukemia cells after a single exposure to 1-100 microM concentrations, whereas the 2-ME metabolite, 2-methoxyacetic acid, was only half as effective. The two glycol alkyl ethers with demonstrable anti-leukemic activity, 2-ME and 2-EE, also exhibited a favorable efficacy-to-toxicity ratio and should be considered for further development as chemotherapeutic agents.","['Dieter, M P', 'Jameson, C W', 'Maronpot, R R', 'Langenbach, R', 'Braun, A G']","['Dieter MP', 'Jameson CW', 'Maronpot RR', 'Langenbach R', 'Braun AG']","['National Institutes of Health, National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, Research Triangle Park, NC 27709.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",Germany,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol,Cancer chemotherapy and pharmacology,7806519,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Ethylene Glycols)']",IM,"['Administration, Oral', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use/toxicity', '*Disease Models, Animal', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Ethylene Glycols/*therapeutic use/toxicity', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Rats', 'Rats, Inbred F344', 'Remission Induction', 'Structure-Activity Relationship']",1990/01/01 00:00,1990/01/01 00:01,['1990/01/01 00:00'],"['1990/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol. 1990;26(3):173-80. doi: 10.1007/BF02897195.,,['10.1007/BF02897195 [doi]'],,,,,,,,

Furthermore, it has been suggested that the paradoxical decrease in TG-induced cytotoxicity at high drug concentrations may be due to an antagonistic interaction between these two mechanisms, in which purine starvation inhibits DNA synthesis and, therefore, incorporation of TG into DNA. In this report we test the hypothesis that by concurrent treatment of L1210 cells with TG and the purine precursor 4-amino-5-imidazolecarboxamide (AIC) it is possible to alleviate DNA synthesis inhibition caused by high concentrations of TG, thus enhancing TG incorporation into DNA and TG-induced cell kill. Both the cytotoxic and cytokinetic results presented support this hypothesis. However, gross incorporation of TG into DNA was not increased by AIC under conditions in which a significant enhancement of cytotoxicity (i.e., 1 log) was observed. These findings suggest that the potentiating effect of AIC may be most prominent on the subpopulation of cells that are resistant to treatment with TG alone, and they demonstrate that the cytotoxic effects of TG treatments are more accurately reflected by observing specific cytokinetic changes (delayed late S/G2 arrest) than by measuring the average extent of TG incorporation into DNA within a given population. Finally, we propose that it may be possible to select conditions for administration of TG that favor one or the other cytotoxic mechanism, depending on whether the clinical objective is induction of remission (where rapid cell lysis due to purine starvation would be desired) or eradication of subclinical disease during remission (where proliferation-dependent cytotoxicity due to DNA incorporation should be more effective.","['Maybaum, J', 'Morgans, C W', 'Ting, P', 'Rogers, C E']","['Maybaum J', 'Morgans CW', 'Ting P', 'Rogers CE']","['Department of Pharmacology, University of Michigan Medical School, Ann Arbor 48109-0504.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Germany,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol,Cancer chemotherapy and pharmacology,7806519,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Imidazoles)', '360-97-4 (Aminoimidazole Carboxamide)', 'FTK8U1GZNX (Thioguanine)']",IM,"['Aminoimidazole Carboxamide/*toxicity', 'Animals', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'DNA, Neoplasm/drug effects/metabolism', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Drug Synergism', 'Imidazoles/*toxicity', 'Leukemia L1210/drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Mice', 'Thioguanine/*toxicity', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects/metabolism/pathology']",1990/01/01 00:00,1990/01/01 00:01,['1990/01/01 00:00'],"['1990/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol. 1990;26(3):168-72. doi: 10.1007/BF02897194.,['CA-40260/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],['10.1007/BF02897194 [doi]'],,,,,,,,

Variations in the structure of the side chains of ametantrone analogues had little effect on the kinetic stability of the complexes, but the mitoxantrone complexes dissociated about an order of magnitude more slowly, suggesting an important role for the two hydroxyl groups on the chromophore of the latter compound. The results are consistent with other n.m.r. and molecular mechanics data, which suggest a binding model where the chromophore intercalates perpendicularly to the DNA base pair axis.

The nuclear run-on experiments were performed and revealed that TPA treatment did not change TK gene activity in HL-60 cells. These findings suggested that the expression of TK mRNA was controlled by a post-transcriptional mechanism. The half-life of mature TK mRNA transcript was found to be more than 8 hours in both proliferating and differentiated HL-60 cells, which indicated that the stability of mature TK mRNA does not play a role in regulating TK gene expression. Analysis of poly(A-) TK mRNAs showed the high molecular weight precursors of TK mRNA which appeared in proliferating cells were not detectable in TPA-treated cells.

These studies demonstrated that the risk of childhood leukemia was increased near certain other nuclear plants. Although the reasons for the increase are still unclear, the scientific debate stimulated by these findings has clarified some of the special methodological problems encountered when studying rare diseases in small areas. Firstly, unless a specific hypothesis is defined in advance, the relevance of a single geographic cluster of disease can rarely be interpreted. Even when a prior hypothesis exists, the small number of cases which generally occur in a small area make the findings highly sensitive to reporting, diagnostic, or classification errors. The statistical power of such investigations is also usually low and only marked increases in risk can be detected.

Induction of mutants by X radiation at the hemizygous hprt locus was dose-rate independent for both strains. These results are in agreement with the hypothesis that the majority of X-radiation-induced TK-/- mutants harbor multilocus deletions caused by the interaction of damaged DNA sites. Repair of DNA lesions during low-dose-rate X irradiation would be expected to reduce the probability of lesion interaction. The results suggest that in contrast to the TK-/- mutants, the majority of mutations at the hprt locus in these strains of L5178Y cells are caused by single lesions subject to dose-rate-independent repair. The vast majority of the TK-/- mutants of strain LY-R16 showed loss of the entire active tk allele, whether the mutants arose spontaneously or were induced by high-dose-rate or low-dose-rate X irradiation. The proportion of TK-/- mutants with multilocus deletions (in which the products of both the tk gene and the closely linked gk gene were inactivated) was higher in the repair-deficient strain LY-S1 than in strain LY-R16. However, even though the mutant frequency decreased with dose rate, the proportion of mutants showing inactivation of both the tk and gk genes increased with a decrease in dose rate. The reason for these apparently conflicting results concerning the effect of DNA repair on the induction of extended lesions is under investigation.","['Evans, H H', 'Nielsen, M', 'Mencl, J', 'Horng, M F', 'Ricanati, M']","['Evans HH', 'Nielsen M', 'Mencl J', 'Horng MF', 'Ricanati M']","['Department of Radiology, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, Ohio 44106.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Radiat Res,Radiation research,0401245,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)']",IM,"['Animals', '*DNA Damage', 'DNA, Neoplasm/*radiation effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Radiation', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Leukemia L5178', 'Mice', '*Mutation', 'Radiation Genetics', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/radiation effects']",1990/06/01 00:00,1990/06/01 00:01,['1990/06/01 00:00'],"['1990/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Radiat Res. 1990 Jun;122(3):316-25.,"['P30 CA43703/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R37 CA15901/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,['Radiat Res 1990 Nov;124(2):248'],,,

Maintenance therapy during remission usually includes oral mercaptopurine and methotrexate. Recently, wide variability in the bioavailability of oral mercaptopurine has been demonstrated, and there is concern that this may affect the risk of relapse. METHODS: To investigate whether lower systemic exposure to mercaptopurine may increase the risk of relapse in acute lymphocytic leukemia, we prospectively studied 23 children receiving maintenance therapy. On the basis of disease features, 11 were classified as being at low risk of relapse, and 12 at standard risk. Those who relapsed (n = 10) did not differ from those who did not in their mean age, hemoglobin level, mean daily dose of mercaptopurine and weekly dose of methotrexate, or the total number of days during which mercaptopurine and methotrexate therapy was interrupted. RESULTS: There was a significant difference in the mean (+/- SEM) area under the mercaptopurine concentration-time curve achieved by a dose of 1 mg of mercaptopurine per square meter of body-surface area: 1636 +/- 197 nmol per liter x minutes in those who relapsed, as compared with 2424 +/- 177 nmol per liter x minutes in those who did not (P less than 0.005). This caused a significantly lower total daily systemic exposure to mercaptopurine in those who relapsed (104,043 +/- 12,812 nmol per liter x minutes) than in those who did not (168,862 +/- 18,830 nmol per liter x minutes) (P less than 0.005). An identical tendency prevailed when patients at low risk and patients at standard risk were analyzed separately. Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed that children in whom an area under the curve of less than 1971 nmol per liter x minutes was achieved by a dose of 1 mg of mercaptopurine per square meter had a significantly poorer prognosis than those with larger areas under the curve (P less than 0.01). Similarly, those with a total daily systemic exposure of more than 137,970 nmol per liter x minutes had a significantly better prognosis than those with a lower exposure (P less than 0.005). CONCLUSIONS: Low systemic exposure to oral mercaptopurine during maintenance therapy for acute lymphocytic leukemia in childhood adversely affects prognosis. Children should be studied at the beginning of maintenance therapy to establish the pharmacokinetics of mercaptopurine, and the dose should be tailored to achieve an appropriate systemic exposure.","['Koren, G', 'Ferrazini, G', 'Sulh, H', 'Langevin, A M', 'Kapelushnik, J', 'Klein, J', 'Giesbrecht, E', 'Soldin, S', 'Greenberg, M']","['Koren G', 'Ferrazini G', 'Sulh H', 'Langevin AM', 'Kapelushnik J', 'Klein J', 'Giesbrecht E', 'Soldin S', 'Greenberg M']","['Division of Clinical Pharmacology, Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, ON, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,N Engl J Med,The New England journal of medicine,0255562,"['E7WED276I5 (Mercaptopurine)', 'EC 1.17.3.2 (Xanthine Oxidase)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Biological Availability', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Humans', 'Mercaptopurine/*administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use', 'Methotrexate/administration & dosage/therapeutic use', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/*mortality', 'Prognosis', 'Prospective Studies', 'Recurrence', 'Remission Induction', 'Risk Factors', 'Survival Analysis', 'Xanthine Oxidase/metabolism']",1990/07/05 00:00,1990/07/05 00:01,['1990/07/05 00:00'],"['1990/07/05 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/07/05 00:01 [medline]', '1990/07/05 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,N Engl J Med. 1990 Jul 5;323(1):17-21. doi: 10.1056/NEJM199007053230104.,,['10.1056/NEJM199007053230104 [doi]'],,,,,,['N Engl J Med. 1990 Nov 29;323(22):1565-6.

There were three fatal toxic events, two due to viral infection and one to a second malignant tumor (NHL). Three other patients developed a second malignant tumour, and one developed a thyroid adenoma. No patient developed acute leukemia. These results are compared with the results of treatment of surgically staged children by extended field irradiation alone, with bimodal treatment reserved for relapse or advanced disease at diagnosis. Initial bimodal treatment improved the overall 10 year survival free from a second relapse rate by 20% (86% vs. 66%). No major difference in treatment toxicity between these two groups has emerged during the first 10 years of follow-up. We conclude that, except for favourable CS-1 presentations, children with Hodgkin's disease confined to the lymphatic system should be given bimodal treatment, but that the least morbid effective combination remains to be determined.","['Jenkin, D', 'Doyle, J', 'Berry, M', 'Blanchette, V', 'Chan, H', 'Doherty, M', 'Freedman, M', 'Greenberg, M', 'Panzarella, T', 'Saunders, F']","['Jenkin D', 'Doyle J', 'Berry M', 'Blanchette V', 'Chan H', 'Doherty M', 'Freedman M', 'Greenberg M', 'Panzarella T', 'Saunders F', 'et al.']","['Division of Hematology/Oncology, Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,Med Pediatr Oncol,Medical and pediatric oncology,7506654,"['35S93Y190K (Procarbazine)', '50D9XSG0VR (Mechlorethamine)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', 'VB0R961HZT (Prednisone)', 'MOPP protocol']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Hodgkin Disease/mortality/pathology/*therapy', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Male', 'Mechlorethamine/administration & dosage', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Neoplasms, Multiple Primary/epidemiology/surgery', 'Pilot Projects', 'Prednisone/administration & dosage', 'Procarbazine/administration & dosage', 'Radiation Injuries/epidemiology', 'Radiotherapy Dosage', 'Recurrence', 'Survival Rate', 'Vincristine/administration & dosage', 'Virus Diseases/epidemiology']",1990/01/01 00:00,1990/01/01 00:01,['1990/01/01 00:00'],"['1990/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Med Pediatr Oncol. 1990;18(4):265-72. doi: 10.1002/mpo.2950180402.,,['10.1002/mpo.2950180402 [doi]'],,,,,,,,

NK activity was also measured. Four of the seven subpopulations of lymphocytes studied, Leu-11+19+, Leu-11+19-, Leu-11+7-, and Leu-19+11-, showed significant within-subject effects over time, using repeated measures ANOVA. Simple contrasts with baseline values showed that, at 1.5 h and 21 h recovery, total number of lymphocytes bearing three different combinations of NK markers, Leu-11+19+, Leu-11+19-, and Leu-11+7-, were significantly decreased when compared with baseline values. At 1.5 h recovery, NK activity was significantly decreased below baseline levels for four of the six effector NK cell/target K562 myelogenous leukemia cell (E:T) ratios tested. At 6 h recovery, NK activity was still decreased significantly with the 12.5:1 and 3:1 E:T ratios. By 21 h recovery, NK activity did not differ significantly from baseline levels.

Examination of genomic DNA demonstrates that the two CP mRNAs are produced from a single gene by alternative spliced patterns. The additional amino acids deduced in CP-1 are products of alternative splicing within an intron of the CP gene at a site 12 nucleotide bases 3' to the commonly used site of CP-2. The CP-1 mRNA transcript encoding four extra amino acids appeared as a minor species accompanying CP-2 mRNA in placenta and chondrocytes. CP-1 mRNA was the predominant CP transcript in a lymphoblastic leukemia cell line, CEM. The mRNA examined from other tissues contained only CP-2 mRNA transcripts.

On the other hand, IFN-alpha did not exert a noticeable proliferative effect on HCL cells but rather inhibited the proliferation of BCGF-treated cells. In addition, IFN-alpha treatment revealed an enhanced expression of class I (4 of 9) and class II (12 of 15) human leukocyte antigen on target HCs. Two-day exposure of HCs to IFN-alpha resulted in enhanced expression of CD25 (11 of 14), whereas a decrease in CD25 expression was recorded in 4 of 5 cases treated with IFN-alpha for 3 days. Also, no significant change in the expression of two other HCL-related surface antigens, CD22 (S-HCL-1; Leu-14) and CD11c(S-HCL-3; Leu-M5), was recorded following up to 3 days of IFN-alpha or BCGF treatment. However, a 5-day exposure to IFN-alpha resulted in a significant decrease in expression of CD11c on treated HCs. Finally, the IFN-alpha-induced immunoultrastructural changes in target HCs were primarily encountered in cells from HCL cases classified as responders to in vivo IFN-alpha therapy. Our data add support to the concept that the effect of IFN-alpha in HCL is mediated by impairment of the response to B-cell growth factors and induction of further differentiation of the target cells.","['Gamliel, H', 'Brownstein, B H', 'Gurfel, D', 'Wu, S H', 'Rosner, M C', 'Golomb, H M']","['Gamliel H', 'Brownstein BH', 'Gurfel D', 'Wu SH', 'Rosner MC', 'Golomb HM']","['Department of Medicine, University of Chicago Medical Center, Illinois 60637.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Antigens, Surface)', '0 (HLA Antigens)', '0 (Interferon Type I)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-2)', '207137-56-2 (Interleukin-4)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/*metabolism', 'Antigens, Surface/metabolism', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'HLA Antigens/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Interferon Type I/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Interleukin-4/antagonists & inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Hairy Cell/immunology/metabolism/*pathology/therapy', 'Male', 'Microscopy, Electron', 'Middle Aged', 'Receptors, Interleukin-2/*metabolism']",1990/07/01 00:00,1990/07/01 00:01,['1990/07/01 00:00'],"['1990/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 1990 Jul 1;50(13):4111-20.,,,,,,,,,,

It has been shown to carbamoylate and inactivate glutathione reductase thereby reducing the intracellular levels of glutathione (GSH). Since GSH depletion by buthionine-S,R-sulfoximine potentiates the cytotoxicity of cyclophosphamide, with a corresponding increase in DNA cross-linking, we have investigated the potential interaction between BHCNU and cyclophosphamide. Treatment of K562 human leukemia cells with 15 microM BHCNU for 1 h resulted in depletion of glutathione to 40% of control values, without significant reduction of cell viability. Subsequent treatment with 10 microM 4-hydroperoxycyclophosphamide (4-HC), a self-activating derivative of cyclophosphamide, reduced the level of glutathione to less than 20% of control values. BHCNU pretreatment enhanced the cytotoxicity of 4-HC resulting in a dose modification factor of 2.5. Alkaline elution analysis of cellular DNA demonstrated that the level of interstrand cross-linking was 2-fold higher in GSH-depleted cells than in nondepleted cells, and the induction of single strand breaks was markedly increased. These findings demonstrate that BHCNU potentiates the cytotoxicity of 4-HC and suggest that this is due to the increased formation of DNA interstrand cross-links caused by a reduced intracellular conjugation of 4-HC with glutathione which results in an increased binding of 4-HC to DNA targets.","['Chresta, C M', 'Crook, T R', 'Souhami, R L']","['Chresta CM', 'Crook TR', 'Souhami RL']","['Department of Oncology, University College, London, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Cross-Linking Reagents)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Nitrosourea Compounds)', '1XBF4E50HS (4-hydroxycyclophosphamide)', ""80413-77-0 (N,N'-bis(4-hydroxycyclohexyl)-N'-nitrosourea)"", '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'GAN16C9B8O (Glutathione)']",IM,"['Cross-Linking Reagents/pharmacology', 'Cyclophosphamide/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', '*DNA Damage', 'DNA, Neoplasm/*drug effects', 'Drug Resistance/genetics', 'Drug Synergism', 'Glutathione/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/genetics/*metabolism', 'Nitrosourea Compounds/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects/metabolism']",1990/07/01 00:00,1990/07/01 00:01,['1990/07/01 00:00'],"['1990/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 1990 Jul 1;50(13):4067-71.,,,,,,,,,,

The tumoricidal activity was analyzed by the elimination of clonogenic leukemia cells (leukemic colony-forming cells), by the inhibition of the proliferative capacity [( 3H]thymidine incorporation) of leukemia cells, and by the elimination of viable leukemia cells measured with flow cytometry. The tumoricidal activity of ALP was dose and incubation time related, as, although to a lesser extent, held true for normal marrow progenitors. For some leukemias the ALP dose necessary for the elimination of 100% of the leukemic colony-forming cells is probably too toxic for normal marrow cells. The results of this study strongly support the possibility that ALP is a promising purging agent in the majority of patients with leukemias.","['Verdonck, L F', 'Witteveen, E O', 'van Heugten, H G', 'Rozemuller, E', 'Rijksen, G']","['Verdonck LF', 'Witteveen EO', 'van Heugten HG', 'Rozemuller E', 'Rijksen G']","['Department of Haematology, University Hospital Utrecht, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Phospholipid Ethers)', '1Y6SNA8L5S (edelfosine)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Blast Crisis', 'Bone Marrow/drug effects', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Child', '*Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Phospholipid Ethers/*pharmacology', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Transplantation, Autologous', '*Tumor Stem Cell Assay']",1990/07/01 00:00,1990/07/01 00:01,['1990/07/01 00:00'],"['1990/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 1990 Jul 1;50(13):4020-5.,,,,,,,,,,

The cells were first treated with 5-FUra, washed, and then treated with various concentrations of differentiation inducers: hexamethylene bisacetamide (HMBA), dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), and N-methylformamide. Pretreatment with 5-FUra, shown here to be a weak inducer of MEL cell differentiation, enhanced the subsequent HMBA induction of differentiation. The three inducers of differentiation markedly inhibited cell growth and increased cell death in a dose- and time-dependent manner if given immediately after cells were exposed to 5-FUra. In contrast, 5-FUra at similar concentrations inhibited cell growth, but only slightly increased cell death, while inducers without 5-FUra had little effect on cell growth or viability. When placed in fresh drug-free medium for 6 days following drug treatments, the cells completely recovered from the growth inhibition of 5-FUra as a single agent, whereas in cells previously treated with only HMBA there was a inhibition of cell growth without loss of viability. In contrast, a profound and prolonged growth inhibition with 98% cell death occurred in cells previously treated with 5-FUra followed by HMBA. The enhancement of 5-FUra cytotoxicity appeared to be directly related to the degree of differentiation and to biochemical events that occur during the commitment to terminal cell division induced by N-methylformamide, DMSO, or HMBA. An increase in Okazaki fragments was found in MEL cells treated with HMBA or DMSO when committed to terminal cell division. DNA breaks also follow 5-FUra treatment (A. Yoshioka et al., J. Biol. Chem., 262: 8235-8241, 1987) and may be the events that lead to cell death. The marked increase in cell death resulting from 5-FUra/HMBA treatment may be, at least partly, a consequence of increased DNA breaks due to 5-FUra followed by inhibition of DNA repair which is known to occur following the HMBA or DMSO induction of differentiation and commitment to terminal cell division. This combined sequential cytotoxic-differentiation therapy resulting in synergistic cytotoxicity and differentiation may be the basis of a new approach to cancer therapy and may aid in reducing the amounts of chemotherapeutic agents required for effective treatment, while maintaining or even increasing their therapeutic effects.","['Waxman, S', 'Scher, B M', 'Hellinger, N', 'Scher, W']","['Waxman S', 'Scher BM', 'Hellinger N', 'Scher W']","['Rochell Belfer Chemotherapy Foundation Laboratory, Department of Medicine, Mount Sinai Medical Center, New York, New York 10029.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Acetamides)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Formamides)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)', 'LA133J59VU (hexamethylene bisacetamide)', 'Q573I9DVLP (Leucovorin)', 'U3P01618RT (Fluorouracil)', 'XPE4G7Y986 (methylformamide)', 'YOW8V9698H (Dimethyl Sulfoxide)']",IM,"['Acetamides/*therapeutic use', 'Animals', 'Cell Count/drug effects', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'DNA Repair/drug effects', 'DNA, Neoplasm/biosynthesis/drug effects', 'Dexamethasone/pharmacology', 'Dimethyl Sulfoxide/pharmacology', 'Drug Synergism', 'Drug Therapy, Combination', 'Fluorouracil/*therapeutic use', 'Formamides/pharmacology', 'Leucovorin/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Mice', 'Time Factors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1990/07/01 00:00,1990/07/01 00:01,['1990/07/01 00:00'],"['1990/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 1990 Jul 1;50(13):3878-87.,,,,,,,,,,

Both strategies have apparent limitations arising from their direct interference with only one determinant of the intracellular AdoHcy/AdoMet ratio, a parameter proposed to be indicative of methylation inhibition. The biological consequences of maximally altering this ratio have been examined by the combined use of an inhibitor of AdoMet synthetase, L-2-amino-4-methoxy-cis-but-3-enoic acid (L-cisAMB), with inhibitors of AdoHcy hydrolase, 9-(trans-2',trans-3'-di-hydroxycyclopent- 4'-enyl)adenine (DHCA) and neplanocin A. At concentrations which inhibited growth of L1210 cells by 50% at 48 h, L-cisAMB alone rapidly depleted AdoMet pools, while neplanocin A or DHCA alone led to an accumulation of AdoHcy. When L-cisAMB was combined with either neplanocin A or DHCA, AdoHcy increased and, concomitantly, AdoMet pools decreased. The resultant AdoHcy/AdoMet ratios for up to 48 h ranged from 2.2 to 3.6-a value 4-fold greater than those achieved with neplanocin A or DHCA alone. This elevation in the AdoHcy/AdoMet ratio was accompanied by marked and sustained interference with DNA and RNA methylation and with a near-total inhibition of cell growth for a period of 24 to 96 h. Thus, the combined treatment with these two types of mechanistically different methylation inhibitors resulted in significantly enhanced interference with nucleic acid methylation and cell growth, both of which correlated directly with unprecedented increases in the AdoHcy/AdoMet ratio. This approach may have therapeutic implications in antiviral and/or antitumor strategies targeting methylation.","['Kramer, D L', 'Porter, C W', 'Borchardt, R T', 'Sufrin, J R']","['Kramer DL', 'Porter CW', 'Borchardt RT', 'Sufrin JR']","['Grace Cancer Drug Center, Roswell Park Cancer Institute, Buffalo, New York 14263.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Polyamines)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '0LVT1QZ0BA (Homocysteine)', ""112318-09-9 (9-(2',3'-dihydroxycyclopent-4'-enyl)adenine)"", '72877-50-0 (neplanocin A)', '7LP2MPO46S (S-Adenosylmethionine)', '979-92-0 (S-Adenosylhomocysteine)', 'K72T3FS567 (Adenosine)']",IM,"['Adenosine/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'DNA, Neoplasm/*metabolism', 'Homocysteine/*analogs & derivatives', 'Leukemia L1210/metabolism/*pathology', 'Methylation', 'Polyamines/metabolism', 'RNA, Neoplasm/*metabolism', 'S-Adenosylhomocysteine/*metabolism', 'S-Adenosylmethionine/*biosynthesis', 'Time Factors']",1990/07/01 00:00,1990/07/01 00:01,['1990/07/01 00:00'],"['1990/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 1990 Jul 1;50(13):3838-42.,"['CA-13038/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-24538/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'GM-29332/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,

The incidence, 10-year actuarial risk, and relative risk of developing an acute leukemia, solid tumor, or second lymphoma were determined by treatment modality and initial lymphoma type. Among the 313 Hodgkin's disease patients, the acute leukemia actuarial risk was 2.0% after chemotherapy, 1.4% after radiation therapy, and 0.9% after combined treatment with chemotherapy and radiation therapy. Their relative risk for acute leukemia was 51.3 overall (95% confidence interval [CI] 13.8 to 131.8) and was elevated in each treatment group. Among the 686 non-Hodgkin's lymphoma patients, the acute leukemia actuarial risk was zero after radiation therapy, 4.6% after chemotherapy, and 4.5% after the combined treatment, again not significantly different between treatment groups. The leukemia relative risk was 10.6 (95% CI 3.4 to 24.8) in the chemotherapy and 11.9 (95% CI 3.2 to 30.6) in the combined treatment group. Among both the Hodgkin's disease and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma populations, the combined treatment group had a lower actuarial risk for solid tumors than either the chemotherapy or radiation therapy group (P less than 0.02). Solid tumor actuarial risk did not differ significantly between the chemotherapy and radiation therapy groups. Hodgkin's disease patients had a solid tumor relative risk that was elevated significantly after radiation therapy (6.5; 95% CI 2.4 to 14.0) and to a lesser extent after chemotherapy (2.6; 95% CI 0.8 to 6.1) or combined treatment (1.7; 95% CI 0.2 to 6.0). Solid tumor relative risk among non-Hodgkin's lymphoma patients was 0.3 for the combined treatment, 0.8 for the chemotherapy, and 1.0 for the radiation therapy group. None of the Hodgkin's disease patients developed a non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. This study found no significant difference in leukemia risk among lymphoma patients treated with chemotherapy and the combined treatment.

Inhibition was observed at nanomolar concentrations of folate or 5-formyltetrahydrofolate where the high-affinity binding protein is the predominant uptake route for folate compounds. At 1.0 nM folate, inhibition of growth by 50% occurred at 0.7 nM homofolate, and maximal inhibition exceeded 90% at homofolate concentrations above 10 nM. Homofolate also inhibited the uptake of 1.0 nM [3H]folate by L1210/JT-1 cells in 72-hr cultures, and the extent of uptake inhibition by 1.0 and 20 nM homofolate was comparable to the inhibition of cell growth by the same concentrations of homofolate. At a growth-limiting concentration of 5-formyltetrahydrofolate (0.5 nM), half-maximal inhibition of L1210/JT-1 cell growth occurred at 1.0 nM homofolate. When excess concentrations of folate (5 microM) or 5-formyltetrahydrofolate (0.5 microM) were added to the medium, no growth inhibition was observed for homofolate at concentrations up to 100 microM. Parental cells lacking the folate binding protein did not respond to homofolate either at growth-limiting (0.5 microM) or excess (5.0 microM) levels of folate. Binding measurements showed that homofolate has a high affinity for the folate-binding protein (Ki = 0.03 nM) but interacts poorly with the reduced-folate transport system (Ki = 203 microM). These results indicate that homofolate inhibits the growth of L1210 cells when intracellular folates are acquired via the high-affinity folate binding protein. The basis for this inhibition appears to be competition by homofolate for substrate binding and internalization.","['Henderson, G B', 'Strauss, B P']","['Henderson GB', 'Strauss BP']","['Department of Molecular and Experimental Medicine, Scripps Clinic and Research Foundation, La Jolla, CA 92037.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Biochem Pharmacol,Biochemical pharmacology,0101032,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '3566-25-4 (homofolic acid)', '935E97BOY8 (Folic Acid)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Animals', '*Antineoplastic Agents', 'Carrier Proteins/metabolism', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Folic Acid/*analogs & derivatives/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Growth Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia L1210/metabolism', 'Methotrexate/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/*drug effects']",1990/06/15 00:00,1990/06/15 00:01,['1990/06/15 00:00'],"['1990/06/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/06/15 00:01 [medline]', '1990/06/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Biochem Pharmacol. 1990 Jun 15;39(12):2019-25. doi: 10.1016/0006-2952(90)90624-t.,['CA-23970/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['0006-2952(90)90624-T [pii]', '10.1016/0006-2952(90)90624-t [doi]']",,,,,,,,

Since our preliminary studies demonstrated that dolastatin 10 inhibited tubulin polymerization and the binding of radiolabeled vinblastine to tubulin, an initial characterization of the properties of dolastatin 10 included a comparison to other antimitotic drugs interfering with vinca alkaloid binding to tubulin (vinblastine, maytansine, rhizoxin, and phomopsin A). Dolastatin 10 inhibited the growth of L1210 murine leukemia cells in culture, with a concordant rise in the mitotic index, and its IC50 value for cell growth was 0.5 nM. Comparable values for the other drugs were 0.5 nM for maytansine, 1 nM for rhizoxin, 20 nM for vinblastine, and 7 microM for phomopsin A. IC50 values were also obtained for the polymerization of purified tubulin in glutamate: 1.2 microM for dolastatin 10, 1.4 microM for phomopsin A, 1.5 microM for vinblastine, 3.5 microM for maytansine, and 6.8 microM for rhizoxin. Dolastatin 10 and vinblastine were comparable in their effects on microtubule assembly dependent on microtubule-associated proteins. Preliminary studies indicated that dolastatin 10, like vinblastine, causes formation of a cold-stable tubulin aggregate at higher drug concentrations. We confirmed that rhizoxin, phomopsin A, and maytansine also inhibit the binding of radiolabeled vinblastine and vincristine to tubulin. Dolastatin 10 and phomopsin A were the strongest inhibitors of these reactions, and rhizoxin the weakest. Dolastatin 10, phomopsin A, maytansine, vinblastine, and rhizoxin all inhibited tubulin-dependent GTP hydrolysis. The greatest inhibition of hydrolysis was observed with dolastatin 10 and phomopsin A, and the least inhibition with rhizoxin.","['Bai, R', 'Pettit, G R', 'Hamel, E']","['Bai R', 'Pettit GR', 'Hamel E']","['Division of Cancer Treatment, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",England,Biochem Pharmacol,Biochemical pharmacology,0101032,"['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Aziridines)', '0 (Depsipeptides)', '0 (Diamines)', '0 (Oligopeptides)', '0 (Organophosphorus Compounds)', '0 (Thiazoles)', '0 (Tubulin)', '0 (Vinca Alkaloids)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '79394-15-3 (dolastatin 1)', '86-01-1 (Guanosine Triphosphate)', '91489-41-7 (DIAM 3)', 'EI946JT51X (dolastatin 10)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/*pharmacology', 'Aziridines/*pharmacokinetics', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Depsipeptides', 'Diamines/*pharmacokinetics', 'Drug Interactions', 'Guanosine Triphosphate/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mitotic Index/drug effects', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Oligopeptides/*pharmacology', 'Organophosphorus Compounds/*pharmacokinetics', 'Thiazoles/*pharmacology', 'Tubulin/*metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects', 'Vinca Alkaloids/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'Vincristine/metabolism']",1990/06/15 00:00,1990/06/15 00:01,['1990/06/15 00:00'],"['1990/06/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/06/15 00:01 [medline]', '1990/06/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Biochem Pharmacol. 1990 Jun 15;39(12):1941-9. doi: 10.1016/0006-2952(90)90613-p.,,"['0006-2952(90)90613-P [pii]', '10.1016/0006-2952(90)90613-p [doi]']",,,,,,,,

We have carried out detailed studies of the selective effect of HIM1 on IL-3-mediated stimulation of hematopoietic progenitors. Preincubation of normal human bone marrow mononuclear cells, depleted of adherent cells and T cells, with HIM1 antibody resulted in a dose-dependent inhibition of IL-3-mediated stimulation of both erythroid burst-forming units (maximum inhibition 55%) and granulocyte/macrophage colony-forming units (maximum inhibition 49%). HIM1 antibody had no effect on growth of erythroid colony-forming units in culture. In addition, preincubation of the cells with HIM1 antibody had no deleterious effect on granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor-induced growth of either erythroid bursts or granulocyte/macrophage colonies. To be certain that the HIM1 antibody did not react directly with IL-3 itself, we attempted to use immunodepletion to remove IL-3 that had been added to our culture medium. Although we were able to remove IL-3 bioactivity by immunodepletion with anti-IL-3 antibody bound to Sepharose beads, beads with attached HIM1 did not remove IL-3 activity from the medium. Polymorphonuclear neutrophils bind high levels of HIM1, although they have very few or no detectable IL-3 receptors.

We now demonstrate the following. (i) Acute transfection and expression of EBNA-2 under control of simian virus 40 or Moloney murine leukemia virus promoters resulted in increased LMP1 expression in P3HR-1-infected Burkitt's lymphoma cells and the P3HR-1 or Daudi cell line. (ii) Transfection and expression of EBNA-LP alone had no effect on LMP1 expression and did not act synergistically with EBNA-2 to affect LMP1 expression. (iii) LMP1 expression in Daudi and P3HR-1-infected cells was controlled at the mRNA level, and EBNA-2 expression in Daudi cells increased LMP1 mRNA. (iv) No other EBV genes were required for EBNA-2 transactivation of LMP1 since cotransfection of recombinant EBNA-2 expression vectors and genomic LMP1 DNA fragments enhanced LMP1 expression in the EBV-negative B-lymphoma cell lines BJAB, Louckes, and BL30. (v) An EBNA-2-responsive element was found within the -512 to +40 LMP1 DNA since this DNA linked to a chloramphenicol acetyltransferase reporter gene was transactivated by cotransfection with an EBNA-2 expression vector. (vi) The EBV type 2 EBNA-2 transactivated LMP1 as well as the EBV type 1 EBNA-2. (vii) Two deletions within the EBNA-2 gene which rendered EBV transformation incompetent did not transactivate LMP1, whereas a transformation-competent EBNA-2 deletion mutant did transactivate LMP1. LMP1 is a potent effector of B-lymphocyte activation and can act synergistically with EBNA-2 to induce cellular CD23 gene expression. Thus, EBNA-2 transactivation of LMP1 amplifies the biological impact of EBNA-2 and underscores its central role in EBV-induced growth transformation.","['Wang, F', 'Tsang, S F', 'Kurilla, M G', 'Cohen, J I', 'Kieff, E']","['Wang F', 'Tsang SF', 'Kurilla MG', 'Cohen JI', 'Kieff E']","['Department of Medicine, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts 02115.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Antigens, Viral)', '0 (EBV-associated membrane antigen, Epstein-Barr virus)', '0 (Epstein-Barr Virus Nuclear Antigens)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (Viral Matrix Proteins)', '0 (Viral Structural Proteins)']",IM,"['Antigens, Viral/*genetics/*physiology', 'B-Lymphocytes/*physiology', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Division', 'Cell Transformation, Viral', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Epstein-Barr Virus Nuclear Antigens', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Viral', 'Genes, Viral', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Regulatory Sequences, Nucleic Acid', 'Trans-Activators/*physiology', '*Viral Matrix Proteins', 'Viral Structural Proteins/genetics']",1990/07/01 00:00,1990/07/01 00:01,['1990/07/01 00:00'],"['1990/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Virol. 1990 Jul;64(7):3407-16. doi: 10.1128/JVI.64.7.3407-3416.1990.,"['CA01395/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA01417/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA17006/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",['10.1128/JVI.64.7.3407-3416.1990 [doi]'],,PMC249594,,,,,,

This switch is accomplished by the post-transcriptional editing of the messenger RNA for apoB-100. We report that a similar switch occurs during the differentiation of the human colonic carcinoma cell line, Caco-2, and that this is accomplished by the same mRNA editing mechanism. Caco-2 cells cultured on Millipore filters developed confluent electrically resistant monolayers, and on Western blot analysis, using a monoclonal antibody directed against the amino terminal region of human apoB-100 (Mab C1.4), secreted greater than 50% apoB-48 (of total apoB-100) into culture media, while Caco-2 cells grown on plastic secreted greater than 95% apoB-100. To assess whether mRNA editing was responsible for the switchover from apoB-100 to apoB-48, apoB cDNA fragments spanning nucleotides 6504-6784 of apoB mRNA were synthesized using RNA isolated from Caco-2 cells grown on filters and Caco-2 cells grown on plastic. The appropriate oligonucleotide primers and Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase were used.

The leukemic cells were first expanded in recombinant human IL-3 in which they acquired a myeloid phenotype, and subsequently were adapted to grow in human rIL-2 in which they became lymphoid committed. The TALL-103/2 cell line expresses only T cell-specific differentiation Ag (CD2, CD3, CD7, and CD8) but has retained the CD33 myeloid Ag originally present on the IL-3 expanded population. By using mAb directed at the TCR-alpha beta or specific for framework determinants on human TCR-gamma and -delta chains, the TALL-103/2 cells were shown to be WT31-, TCR delta 1+, TCS-1+, and Ti gamma A-, thus representing a T cell subset expressing the nondisulfide-linked form of the TCR-gamma delta. The TALL-103/2 cells have been maintained for more than 1 y in the presence of human rIL-2 on which they are strictly dependent. Chemical cross-linking and immunofluorescence studies indicate the presence of both high and intermediate affinity IL-2R on the TALL-103/2 cells. Whereas mAb antiTac and H-31 with reactivity to the IL-2R alpha-chain (p55) compete only partially for the IL-2-induced proliferation of these cells, mAb TU27, specific to the IL-2R beta-subunit (p75), inhibits such growth completely even at high concentrations of IL-2. The interactions of the two T cell-stimulating factors IL-1 and IL-4 on the IL-2-dependent growth of TALL-103/2 cells were investigated. IL-1 alpha synergizes with IL-2 in supporting the short and long term growth of this cell line, whereas IL-4 abrogates its growth. These effects are, at least in part, due to the modulation of IL-2R expression induced by the two lymphokines. Functionally, the TALL-103/2 cells display MHC-nonrestricted cytotoxic activity that is significantly enhanced by addition of either IL-4, IL-6, or IFN-gamma. Because of its properties and its stable requirement for IL-2 for continuous growth, this T lymphocytic leukemia-derived cell line represents an interesting model to analyze ontogeny and function of leukemic T cells.","['Santoli, D', ""O'Connor, R"", 'Cesano, A', 'Phillips, P', 'Colt, T L', 'Lange, B', 'Clark, S C', 'Rovera, G']","['Santoli D', ""O'Connor R"", 'Cesano A', 'Phillips P', 'Colt TL', 'Lange B', 'Clark SC', 'Rovera G']","['Wistar Institute of Anatomy and Biology, Philadelphia, PA 19104.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Interleukin-1)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-2)', '207137-56-2 (Interleukin-4)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD/analysis', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Drug Synergism', 'Humans', 'Immunity, Cellular/drug effects', 'Interleukin-1/*pharmacology', 'Interleukin-2/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Interleukin-4/*pharmacology', 'Major Histocompatibility Complex', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/*classification', 'Receptors, Interleukin-2/physiology', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/*cytology/immunology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1990/06/15 00:00,1990/06/15 00:01,['1990/06/15 00:00'],"['1990/06/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/06/15 00:01 [medline]', '1990/06/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 1990 Jun 15;144(12):4703-11.,"['AG-00378/AG/NIA NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-25875/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-47589/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,,,

The first study goal, to determine the incidence of NIFFD before and during construction, was approached by calculation of incidence rates of NIFFD in patients with acute leukemia, comparing 1982 and 1983 (a baseline period free of construction) to 1986 (a year when construction activity was at its peak). The second study goal, to identify risk factors for the development of NIFFD, was accomplished by reviewing the autopsy records of all patients with underlying hematologic disorders accompanied by granulocytopenia who died in our hospital from 1982 through 1986. Patients with and without autopsy evidence of NIFFD were then compared by univariate and multivariate (logistic regression) analysis to identify potential risk factors for the acquisition of NIFFD. The incidence of NIFFD in patients with acute leukemia hospitalized during the period of hospital construction was significantly increased when compared to a baseline period without construction (11 per 139 versus 4 per 333, p less than .001). Review of all granulocytopenic patients autopsied over the five-year interval 1982 through 1986 revealed duration of granulocytopenia and hospitalization during construction to be risk factors for NIFFD by univariate analysis (p less than .005). Logistic regression showed duration of granulocytopenia to be highly significant independent risk factor (p less than .01) and construction activity to be a probable independent risk factor (p = .09).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","['Weber, S F', 'Peacock, J E Jr', 'Do, K A', 'Cruz, J M', 'Powell, B L', 'Capizzi, R L']","['Weber SF', 'Peacock JE Jr', 'Do KA', 'Cruz JM', 'Powell BL', 'Capizzi RL']","['Section on Infectious Disease, Cancer Center of Wake Forest University, Winston-Salem, North Carolina 27103.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Infect Control Hosp Epidemiol,Infection control and hospital epidemiology,8804099,,IM,"['Cross Infection/*etiology/prevention & control', 'Female', 'Hematologic Diseases/*complications', 'Hospital Bed Capacity, 500 and over', '*Hospital Design and Construction', 'Humans', 'Middle Aged', 'Mycoses/*etiology/prevention & control', 'North Carolina', 'Risk Factors', 'Ventilation/methods']",1990/05/01 00:00,2001/03/28 10:01,['1990/05/01 00:00'],"['1990/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1990/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Infect Control Hosp Epidemiol. 1990 May;11(5):235-42. doi: 10.1086/646160.,['CA-12197/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],['10.1086/646160 [doi]'],,,,,,,,

Evidence for three transporters.,9732-6,"L1210 murine leukemia cells have two nucleoside transport activities that differ in their sensitivity to nitrobenzylmercaptopurine riboside (NBMPR). This study re-examines NBMPR-insensitive nucleoside transport in these cells and finds that it is mediated by two components, one Na(+)-dependent and the other Na(+)-independent. A mutant selected previously for loss of NBMPR-insensitive transport lacks only the Na(+)-independent activity. When NBMPR is used to block efflux via the NBMPR-sensitive transporter, uptake of formycin B (a nonmetabolized analog of inosine) is concentrative in both the parental and mutant cells, but the intracellular concentration of the nucleoside is 5-fold lower in the parental cells. Decreased accumulation of formycin B in the parental cells is due to efflux of the nucleoside via the NBMPR-insensitive, Na(+)-independent transporter that the mutant lacks. The Na(+)-dependent transporter appears to accept most purine, but not pyrimidine, nucleosides as substrates. Two exceptions are uridine, a good substrate, and 7-deazaadenosine, a poor substrate. In contrast, all of the nucleosides tested are substrates for the Na(+)-independent transporter. We conclude that L1210 cells have three distinct nucleoside transporters and that the specificity of the Na(+)-dependent transporter is similar to that of one of the two Na(+)-dependent nucleoside transporters seen in mouse intestinal epithelial cells.","['Crawford, C R', 'Ng, C Y', 'Noel, L D', 'Belt, J A']","['Crawford CR', 'Ng CY', 'Noel LD', 'Belt JA']","[""Department of Biochemical and Clinical Pharmacology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee 38101.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Affinity Labels)', '0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Formycins)', '0 (Nucleosides)', '13877-76-4 (formycin B)', '46S541971T (Thioinosine)', '5A614L51CT (Inosine)', 'GV1L2DZM2Z (4-nitrobenzylthioinosine)']",IM,"['Affinity Labels/pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/*metabolism', 'Biological Transport/drug effects', 'Formycins/*metabolism', 'Inosine/*analogs & derivatives', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia L1210/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Nucleosides/*metabolism', 'Thioinosine/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology']",1990/06/15 00:00,1990/06/15 00:01,['1990/06/15 00:00'],"['1990/06/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/06/15 00:01 [medline]', '1990/06/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1990 Jun 15;265(17):9732-6.,"['CA21765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA33362/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",['S0021-9258(19)38732-0 [pii]'],,,,,,,,

GPIIb-IIIa is a member of the integrin family and serves as a receptor for fibrinogen and other adhesive glycoproteins on the surface of activated blood platelets. Mature platelet GPIIb is processed from a single precursor peptide into a disulfide-linked GPIIb alpha and GPIIb beta chain. To study possible mechanisms which could determine ligand specificity of the GPIIb-IIIa complex we investigated whether there are multiple forms of GPIIb mRNA by screening an unamplified lambda gt10 human erythroleukemia cell cDNA library. Four GPIIb clones were isolated and sequenced. Two contained a 102-nucleotide in-frame deletion corresponding to 34 amino acids in the extracellular domain of GPIIb beta. Polymerase chain reaction amplification of human erythroleukemia cell cDNA confirmed the presence of two different transcripts. Normal genomic DNA sequence was shown to contain consensus splice-donor and splice-acceptor sites indicating a 102-base pair exon that is spliced in or out. Using primers specific for either transcript, both forms of GPIIb mRNA were identified by the polymerase chain reaction in normal human platelets and megakaryocytes, but not in reticulocytes or two white blood cell lines. These data provide evidence for two forms of GPIIb in platelets and megakaryocytes and suggest a mechanism for variations in receptor ligand affinity or localization.","['Bray, P F', 'Leung, C S', 'Shuman, M A']","['Bray PF', 'Leung CS', 'Shuman MA']","['Cancer Research Institute, University of California, San Francisco 94143.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Oligonucleotide Probes)', '0 (Platelet Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Base Sequence', 'Blood Platelets/*metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Gene Library', 'Genes', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute', 'Megakaryocytes/*metabolism', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Oligonucleotide Probes', 'Platelet Membrane Glycoproteins/*genetics', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', '*RNA Splicing', 'RNA, Messenger/*genetics/isolation & purification']",1990/06/15 00:00,1990/06/15 00:01,['1990/06/15 00:00'],"['1990/06/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/06/15 00:01 [medline]', '1990/06/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1990 Jun 15;265(17):9587-90.,"['HL-01815/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL-33277/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL-43020/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",['S0021-9258(19)38705-8 [pii]'],,,"['GENBANK/J05494', 'GENBANK/M18085', 'GENBANK/M54799']",,,,,

Induction of chemotherapy with a combination of 6 drugs (vincristine, cyclophosphamide, cytosine arabinoside, adriamycin, prednisone and L-asparaginase), followed by intensification with methotrexate and L-asparaginase, was introduced in both the usual and the high-risk groups. In a selected group with better prognostic factors, therapy was reduced. In an attempt to minimize the sequelae of CNS prophylactic therapy, cranial irradiation was omitted in half the patients and intrathecal (IT) triple therapy was given instead. Following 2 years of unsatisfactory preliminary results in a very high-risk group (VHR; non-T- and T-cell leukemia with WBC counts of greater than 100,000 and greater than 20,000, respectively), treatment was modified and intensified. Between Nov. 1984 and Feb. 1989, 143 patients were enrolled from 10 hospitals. During follow-up of a median of 2.5 years, there were 32 failures (2 failed remissions, 27 relapsed and 3 died of bleeding and sepsis). 107 patients are alive in first remission and an additional 8 in second and third remissions. By Kaplan-Meier life table analysis, the rates of leukemia-free interval (LFI) and event-free interval (EFI) for 4 years were 60% and 57%, respectively. Improved LFI results of 71% for 4 years were achieved in a group with non-T-cell ALL with WBC less than 100,000 (the largest group, 65% of the patients). In the small ""good risk"" group (10% of patients), and the T-cell group with WBC less than 100,000, LFI for 4 years were 56% and 54%, respectively. In the VHR group, modification seemed to have improved results: LFI of 41% for 3 years. CNS prophylaxis with IT triple therapy was as effective as cranial irradiation in the standard risk group. In 1 out of 33 children on this protocol a single CNS relapse occurred, as compared to 2 out of 35 matched controls with cranial irradiation. These results warrant extension of IT triple therapy to higher risk groups of childhood ALL. As for systemic treatment, increased up-front high-dose intensive therapy is recommended for all groups with ALL, but with reduction of cumulative dose to minimize late effects.","['Stark, B', 'Abramov, A', 'Attias, D', 'Balin, A', 'Burstein, Y', 'Barak, Y', 'Jaber, L', 'Goshen, Y', 'Dvir, A', 'Hagai, E']","['Stark B', 'Abramov A', 'Attias D', 'Balin A', 'Burstein Y', 'Barak Y', 'Jaber L', 'Goshen Y', 'Dvir A', 'Hagai E', 'et al.']","['Pediatric Hematology-Oncology Dept., Beilinson Medical Center, Petah Tikva, Jerusalem.']",['heb'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Israel,Harefuah,Harefuah,0034351,,IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Brain/radiation effects', 'Brain Neoplasms/prevention & control', 'Child', 'Humans', 'Israel/epidemiology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/mortality/radiotherapy', 'Remission Induction', 'Survival Rate']",1990/04/01 00:00,1990/04/01 00:01,['1990/04/01 00:00'],"['1990/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Harefuah. 1990 Apr 1;118(7):373-82.,,,,,,,,,,

Varying doses of 1.5 x 10(4), 5.0 x 10(5), and 1.5 x 10(6) viable tumour cells were inoculated intraperitoneally into groups of either adrenalectomized or sham-operated mice. At days 4 to 7 after the inoculation, adrenalectomized mice inoculated with 1.5 x 10(4) or 5.0 x 10(5) tumour cells had a smaller number of tumour cells in ascites than sham-operated controls. However, after inoculation of 1.5 x 10(6) cells, no significant differences were found at days 2 to 4 between adrenalectomized and sham-operated mice. The growth retardation by adrenalectomy was not observed in adrenalectomized mice supplemented with 4 or 6 micrograms dexamethasone per day per mouse. It suggested that the ablation of glucocorticoids was at least partially responsible for the growth retardation observed in adrenalectomized mice. Cell kinetic analysis revealed that the difference in a potential doubling time could not explain these results. Tumour retention in the peritoneal cavity was measured using [125I]-iododeoxyuridine-labelled tumour cells as a tracer. At days 4 to 6 after inoculation of 5.0 x 10(5) labelled cells, radioactivity in the peritoneal cavity in adrenalectomized mice was about 70 per cent of that in sham-operated mice. This ratio was almost equivalent to the ratio of the number of cells in ascites of adrenalectomized mice to that of sham-operated ones. Consequently, growth retardation observed in adrenalectomized mice resulted from an increase in tumour cell migration and/or in tumour cell death, but not from an increase in doubling time.","['Kimura, K', 'Sakamoto, Y']","['Kimura K', 'Sakamoto Y']","['Department of Oncology, Osaka University Medical School, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Cell Biochem Funct,Cell biochemistry and function,8305874,['7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)'],IM,"['*Adrenalectomy', 'Animals', 'Ascites', 'Cell Division', 'Dexamethasone/pharmacology', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia L1210/*pathology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Peritoneal Cavity', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1990/04/01 00:00,1990/04/01 00:01,['1990/04/01 00:00'],"['1990/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cell Biochem Funct. 1990 Apr;8(2):91-7. doi: 10.1002/cbf.290080203.,,['10.1002/cbf.290080203 [doi]'],,,,,,,,

It also shows that T lymphocyte colonies subcloned with interleukin 2 (IL-2) from CML mixed colonies were inhibited more by rIFN alpha than were similar colonies subcultured from normal mixed colonies. The report demonstrates that the Ph' chromosome is present in such T cell colonies subcultured from CML mixed colonies. When mixed colonies were grown from CML bone marrow in the presence of rIFN alpha, Ph' negative colonies were observed, whereas no such Ph' negative mixed colonies grew from a similar number of bone marrow cells incubated without rIFN alpha. These observations confirm that T lymphocytes derived from bone marrow stem cells are from the CML clone, and that the inhibition of growth of Ph' positive colonies, by rIFN alpha permits the growth of residual normal stem cells.

We examined the mechanism by which macrophages mediate their effect on in vivo erythropoiesis. As reported for whole macrophages, serum-free supernatants (SN) from normal resident peritoneal macrophages suppressed in vivo normal and conventional Friend virus (CFV)-infected CFU-E and caused clinical regression of CFV-induced leukemia in mice. Macrophage SN had no effect on the erythropoietin (EPO)-independent CFU-E characteristic of infection with the polycythemia-inducing strain of Friend virus (FVP), or progression of FVP leukemia. Using biochemical, immunologic, and functional assays, the erythrosuppressive factor in macrophage SN was identified as interleukin-1 alpha (IL-1 alpha). The in vivo erythroid suppressive effects of macrophages, macrophage SN, and IL-1 alpha were reversed by simultaneous treatment with EPO. IL-1 alpha itself had no effect on CFU-E colony formation in vitro. Pretreatment of animals with antibodies to murine tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) completely abrogated the suppression of CFU-E by macrophages, macrophage SN, or human recombinant IL-1 alpha.

Growth of cells in the presence of tunicamycin resulted in the gradual conversion of 3H-labeled polypeptides to a form that migrated more rapidly (Mr 42,000--47,000) during sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)--polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. When plasma membrane fractions were photolabeled and incubated with O-glycanase or endoglycosidase F, the [3H]NBMPR-labeled polypeptides migrated in SDS-polyacrylamide gels with the same mobility as native NBMPR-binding polypeptides, whereas incubation with either N-glycanase or trifluoromethane sulfonic acid converted [3H]NBMPR-labeled polypeptides to the more rapidly migrating form (Mr 41,000--48,000). These observations are consistent with the presence of N-linked oligosaccharides of the complex type on the NBMPR-binding polypeptides of L1210/C2 cells. Tunicamycin exposures that reduced incorporation of [3H]mannose into plasma membrane fractions by greater than 95% had little, if any, effect on either the affinity (Kd values, 0.1-0.2 nM) or abundance (Bmax values, 200,000--220,000 sites/cell) of NBMPR-binding sites, whereas uridine transport kinetics at 37 degrees C were altered in a complex way. Thus, although N-linked glycosylation is not required for insertion of the NBMPR-binding protein into the plasma membrane or for interaction of NBMPR with the high-affinity binding sites, it is important for function of at least one of the three nucleoside transporters expressed by L1210/C2 cells.","['Hogue, D L', 'Hodgson, K C', 'Cass, C E']","['Hogue DL', 'Hodgson KC', 'Cass CE']","['Department of Biochemistry, University of Alberta, Edmonton, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Canada,Biochem Cell Biol,Biochemistry and cell biology = Biochimie et biologie cellulaire,8606068,"['0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Nucleoside Transport Proteins)', '0 (Nucleosides)', '11089-65-9 (Tunicamycin)', '46S541971T (Thioinosine)', 'GV1L2DZM2Z (4-nitrobenzylthioinosine)', 'WHI7HQ7H85 (Uridine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Biological Transport/drug effects', 'Carrier Proteins/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'Glycosylation', 'Leukemia L1210/*metabolism', 'Membrane Proteins/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Nucleoside Transport Proteins', 'Nucleosides/*metabolism', 'Protein Binding/drug effects', 'Thioinosine/analogs & derivatives/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tunicamycin/*pharmacology', 'Uridine/metabolism']",1990/01/01 00:00,1990/01/01 00:01,['1990/01/01 00:00'],"['1990/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Biochem Cell Biol. 1990 Jan;68(1):199-209. doi: 10.1139/o90-026.,,['10.1139/o90-026 [doi]'],,,,,,,,

Specimens from 20 patients (9 males and 11 females, with a median age of 53 years) without any hematologic disorders served as controls. Of the various histologic variables tested, only the counts of neutrophilic granulocytes per 1 sq mm, the ratio of granulocytopoiesis to megakaryopoiesis and the density of reticulin (argyrophilic) fibers revealed a significant correlation with the prognosis. The CML patients were separated into two groups with different survival patterns. Group I (34 patients with a median survival of 24 months) mostly contained cases with the so-called ""megakaryocytic subtype"" of CML, which is accompanied by variable degrees of fibrosis; group II (31 patients with a median survival of 36 months) mainly contained cases with the ""granulocytic subtype,"" which is not accompanied by myelofibrosis. Among the morphometric parameters, a positive correlation existed between the megakaryocyte count and the reticulin fiber density, which underlines the important role of that cell lineage in fibrillogenesis. There were multiple interrelationships between the histomorphometric variables and the laboratory data. Consequently, multivariate regression methods (using Cox's proportional hazards model) were applied to assess the relative predictive value of the patient characteristics for survival. The derived prognostic model divided the patients into two risk groups, with median survivals of 14 and 41 months, respectively. In order of their entry into the regression model, these variables were percentage of neutrophils in the differential blood count, amount of granulopoiesis, liver size, percentage of peripheral myeloblasts and density of reticulin fibers in the bone marrow. In comparing the two patient groups, based on bone marrow histomorphometric parameters, this model revealed that two of those factors (amount of granulopoiesis and density of reticulin fibers) had a significant correlation with the prognosis.","['Thiele, J', 'Wienhold, S', 'Zankovich, R', 'Fischer, R']","['Thiele J', 'Wienhold S', 'Zankovich R', 'Fischer R']","['Institute of Pathology, University of Cologne, Federal Republic of Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Anal Quant Cytol Histol,Analytical and quantitative cytology and histology,8506819,,IM,"['Biopsy/instrumentation/methods', 'Bone Marrow/*pathology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/classification/mortality/*pathology', 'Male', 'Megakaryocytes/pathology', 'Middle Aged', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Neutrophils/pathology', 'Prognosis']",1990/04/01 00:00,1990/04/01 00:01,['1990/04/01 00:00'],"['1990/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Anal Quant Cytol Histol. 1990 Apr;12(2):103-16.,,,,,,,,,,

Indeed, this cell line is characterized by both a capacity for self-renewal and the ability to differentiate spontaneously along erythroid and basophilic cell lineages. In this study we show that interleukin-6 (IL-6) and its specific receptor (IL-6-R) are spontaneously expressed in the human KU812 cell line. Addition of antibody against IL-6 weakly inhibited its cell proliferation (20 to 30%) suggesting that the endogenous production of IL-6 was partially responsible for the growth of the cell line. In contrast, the spontaneous terminal differentiation of this cell line towards the erythroid and basophilic lineages was inhibited by an antibody against IL-6 and this effect was reversed by addition of recombinant human IL-6 (rIL-6). These results suggest that IL-6 is involved more in differentiation than in the proliferation of KU812 cells. After several passages, KU812 cells lose their capacity to differentiate spontaneously. In these cells, the IL-6-R was no more detectable. We therefore suggest that this loss of spontaneous differentiation is associated with an interruption of the IL-6 autocrine loop.","['Navarro, S', 'Louache, F', 'Debili, N', 'Vainchenker, W', 'Doly, J']","['Navarro S', 'Louache F', 'Debili N', 'Vainchenker W', 'Doly J']","['Unite CNRS UPR37, IRSC, Villejuif, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Biochem Biophys Res Commun,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,0372516,"['0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Receptors, Immunologic)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-6)']",IM,"['Cell Differentiation/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-6/biosynthesis/*physiology', 'Leukemia/metabolism/pathology', 'Receptors, Immunologic/biosynthesis', 'Receptors, Interleukin-6', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/*cytology/metabolism']",1990/05/31 00:00,1990/05/31 00:01,['1990/05/31 00:00'],"['1990/05/31 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/05/31 00:01 [medline]', '1990/05/31 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Biochem Biophys Res Commun. 1990 May 31;169(1):184-91. doi: 10.1016/0006-291x(90)91452-x.,,"['0006-291X(90)91452-X [pii]', '10.1016/0006-291x(90)91452-x [doi]']",,,,,,,,

Eight additional patients were also tested with a solid-phase system; 352 (85 percent) of 417 crossmatches were positive and 15 percent were negative. Patients with more reactive LCTAb had very few (often 0-2) in vitro compatible units. Thirty-four transfusions of pooled compatible PCs, all stored less than 3 days, were administered to clinically evaluable patients.

A 4- to 11-fold variation between individuals was found in the pharmacokinetic parameters: peak concentration, time to reach peak, area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC), and fraction of dose excreted in the urine. Three repeated determinations in one individual revealed that AUC also varied more than sixfold following an overnight fast. In three individuals, the reducing agents glutathione (10 mg/kg) and ascorbic acid (15 mg/kg) were coadministered with 6-MP to evaluate their possible role in the protection of 6-MP from oxidation and degradation in the intestinal lumen. No consistent effect was observed, however, on the AUCs of either of these agents. A clear relationship was found between AUCs and the 24-h urinary excretion of unchanged drug (r = 0.9381), indicating that determinations of 6-MP in the urine may replace the painful procedure of repeated blood sampling.

Previous treatments (corticosteroids, immunoglobulins, androgens, immunosuppressor agents, splenectomy) were not effective in any of these cases or in their relatives. A new syndrome can therefore be proposed which can be easily suspected in cases of early onset in life, increased platelet volume, failure of corticosteroids or evidence of a familial blood disorder. It can be proved when the autologous platelet life span is demonstrated to be normal in spite of a chronic thrombocytopenia and a normal megakaryocytic count. The recognition of this syndrome will avoid neonatal complications (cephal-hematomas), surgical complications, and the use of expensive and possibility harmful ineffective treatments, both in the propositus and in other abnormal family members. The syndrome is certainly frequent (54 families are presented here), but the diagnosis is often missed or delayed due to the low risk of hemorrhage.

We performed polymerase chain reaction (PCR), to look for the presence of HTLV-I genomic sequences in those patients. Two primers were chosen for gag and tax genes. Liquid hybridization was performed on the amplified products using an internal 32p labelled oligonucleotide as a probe. The hybridized material was run on a 6% polyacrylamide gel. Forty-three of forty-four seropositive subjects analysed as ""positive controls"" were positive for gag, but only 16/29 for tax. Twenty HTLV-I seronegative neurological patients with a symptomatology suggesting HAM/TSP were tested: 18 were found positive for at least one of the 2 oligonucleotide pairs. Two ""negative controls"": Moya-Moya and vascular brain failure were found negative. 8/9 subjects with uninterpretable WB were also studied by PCR, and 8 were found positive for at least one oligo pair.

It was given in continuous IV infusion from day -8 to day 30 after BMT at the dose of 0.3 microgram/kg/h. The patients were studied according to the risk factors of VOD: diagnosis, intensification of the conditioning and previous liver abnormalities.

One hundred and nine patients were studied, 50 were treated by PGE1 and 59 did not receive it. Univariate analysis shows that the actuarial incidence of VOD was 12.2% in the PGE1 group and 25.5% in the non PGE1 group (P = 0.05). In acute leukemia, it was 39.1% in the non treated group and 12.8% in the PGE1 treated group (P = 0.02). Patients with previous hepatitis had an incidence of 62.5% in the non treated group and 15.5% in the treated group (P = 0.05). A positive CMV serology seemed to increase the risk of VOD: the incidence of VOD was 31.4% in non treated patients and 22% in PGE1 treated patients. The multivariate analysis of the risk factors of VOD show that unfavorable factors were: recipient positive CMV serology (P = 0.06), hepatic disease prior to transplant (P = 0.02) and the absence of PGE1 treatment (P = 0.02).

These results suggest that a human/mouse chimeric antibody can be labeled with 111In and radioiodine without the loss of its immunoreactivity, and that chimeric antibody localizes in vivo in the same way as the parental murine antibody.","['Saga, T', 'Endo, K', 'Koizumi, M', 'Kawamura, Y', 'Watanabe, Y', 'Konishi, J', 'Ueda, R', 'Nishimura, Y', 'Yokoyama, M', 'Watanabe, T']","['Saga T', 'Endo K', 'Koizumi M', 'Kawamura Y', 'Watanabe Y', 'Konishi J', 'Ueda R', 'Nishimura Y', 'Yokoyama M', 'Watanabe T']","['Department of Nuclear Medicine, Kyoto University School of Medicine, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Nucl Med,"Journal of nuclear medicine : official publication, Society of Nuclear Medicine",0217410,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Indium Radioisotopes)', '0 (Iodine Radioisotopes)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/*immunology/pharmacokinetics', 'Antibody Specificity/*immunology', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/*immunology', 'Chimera/*immunology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Indium Radioisotopes', 'Iodine Radioisotopes', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Nude', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/diagnostic imaging/*immunology/metabolism', 'Radionuclide Imaging', 'Tissue Distribution', 'Transplantation, Heterologous']",1990/06/01 00:00,1990/06/01 00:01,['1990/06/01 00:00'],"['1990/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Nucl Med. 1990 Jun;31(6):1077-83.,,,,,,,,,,

DESIGN: Data were analysed using the close pair method developed by Knox for signs of clustering in relation to date and place of onset or date and place of birth. SETTING: Cases were those occurring in the 8 year period between 1953 and 1960 in four old counties of the Midlands of England (Worcestershire, Warwickshire, Staffordshire, Shropshire). CASES: 418 children under 10 years developed cancers during the study period: leukaemia 228, cerebral tumour 99, neuroblastoma 45, nephroblastoma 46. It is thought that data collection was complete. Cases were matched for region, sex and date of birth with live controls. RESULTS: There was evidence among some age groups and diagnoses of an unexpectedly high number of close pairs of onsets, and some indication of similar patterns among births of children who later developed cancer. The pre- and postnatal experiences of children involved in close pairs were examined to see whether they differed from those of control children. Measles appeared to occur more often in the 2-3 years before the onset of leukaemia in children who were later involved in close pairs than in their matched controls. CONCLUSIONS: Common infectious diseases of childhood may play a minor role in the development of some cancers. Epidemics of these diseases may then be reflected on a greatly reduced scale in the subsequent distribution of cancer cases.","['Morris, V']",['Morris V'],"['Department of Fluid Engineering and Instrumentation, Cranfield Institute of Technology, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,J Epidemiol Community Health,Journal of epidemiology and community health,7909766,,IM,"['Age Factors', 'Child', 'Delivery, Obstetric', 'England/epidemiology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/epidemiology/etiology', 'Male', 'Measles/complications', 'Neoplasms/*epidemiology/etiology', 'Space-Time Clustering', 'Statistics as Topic']",1990/03/01 00:00,1990/03/01 00:01,['1990/03/01 00:00'],"['1990/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Epidemiol Community Health. 1990 Mar;44(1):55-8. doi: 10.1136/jech.44.1.55.,,['10.1136/jech.44.1.55 [doi]'],,PMC1060598,,,,,,

DESIGN: A test for spacial clustering was applied using a method which allows for unequal distribution of the population at risk and avoids using census data to provide population denominators. When clustering was identified, four possible aetiological links which had already been suggested to the Leukaemia Research Fund Centre were examined in a local area. SETTING: The study was carried out in the Yorkshire Health Region in the north of England. PATIENTS: 144 children under 15 years of age with a diagnosis of malignant disease known to the Yorkshire Regional Childhood Tumour Registry between 1974 and 1986 were included in the analysis. Of these 53 had leukaemias and nine had lymphomas. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: Significant localised clustering was found in North Humberside, though not in the whole of the Yorkshire Health Region. A number of clustered cases were identified, some of whom were in a post code sector, Hull 10, to the west of Kingston-upon-Hull, about which concern had been expressed since 1985. There was however no evidence that disease clustering was confined to this area. Four previously suggested hypotheses about causation in this particular area were examined but the results were negative or inconclusive. CONCLUSIONS: The identification of spacial clustering must be seen as only the first step in a series of investigations; it can only rarely lead to aetiological conclusions by itself, but it can motivate and target other investigations.","['Alexander, F', 'Cartwright, R', 'McKinney, P A', 'Ricketts, T J']","['Alexander F', 'Cartwright R', 'McKinney PA', 'Ricketts TJ']","['Leukaemia Research Fund Centre for Clinical Epidemiology, Springfield Mount, Leeds.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,J Epidemiol Community Health,Journal of epidemiology and community health,7909766,['0 (Air Pollutants)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Air Pollutants/adverse effects', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'England/epidemiology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia/epidemiology/etiology', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/*epidemiology/etiology', 'Registries', 'Schools', 'Space-Time Clustering']",1990/03/01 00:00,1990/03/01 00:01,['1990/03/01 00:00'],"['1990/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Epidemiol Community Health. 1990 Mar;44(1):39-46. doi: 10.1136/jech.44.1.39.,,['10.1136/jech.44.1.39 [doi]'],,PMC1060595,,,,,,

Levels of actin mRNA and protein synthesis were elevated eight- and sixfold, respectively, after 9 h in CD. This increase was reflected in levels of nuclear run-on actin transcripts and prevented by actinomycin D, suggesting that enhanced transcription of the actin gene was responsible for the increase. Removal of CD resulted in immediate resumption of cell cycle progression with the accumulation of a G2-phase-enriched population and a rapid return of actin mRNA and protein synthesis to control levels (half-life 4.8 h).

The stereochemistry of the cycloadditions was investigated. A high regioselectivity was observed in the reaction of the diene carbamate 2 with 5-methoxy and 5-acetoxy naphthoquinones. This latter gave the unexpected 1,8-regioisomer 3d. The cycloadditions of the dienamide 5 with naphthoquinones 1 (R = OH, OMe, OAc) are regiospecific. Assignment of the structure of the tetrahydroanthraquinone 6b is in good agreement with the known directing effect of the 5-hydroxy group of juglone 1b in analogous Diels-Alder reactions. With 5-methoxy and 5-acetoxy naphthoquinones, the opposite regiochemistry observed is consistent with the electron-donating influence of the methoxy or acetoxy group, making the C-3 carbon atom more electron deficient. Aromatization of the adducts 6b and 7c was accompanied by an unusual elimination of the amido moiety. Thus, 1-hydroxy and 1-methoxy anthraquinones were obtained. Reactions of the dienes 2 and 5 with benzoquinone gave the tetrahydronaphthoquinones 9 and 10 with an endo stereospecificity. Oxidation of 9 by activated manganese dioxide gave the naphthoquinone 11. These compounds were submitted to in vitro cytotoxic assays towards murine L 1210 leukemia cells and clonogenic human tumor cell line MDA-MB 231.

DESIGN: Blinded, controlled follow up of up to 30 years. SETTING: New Zealand. SUBJECTS: 528 Men known to have participated in the tests and a control group of 1504 men who were in the Royal New Zealand Navy during the same period but did not participate in the tests. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Mortality and incidence of cancer. RESULTS: Follow up for the period 1957-87 was 94% complete in test participants and 91% complete in the controls. There were 70 deaths among test participants and 179 deaths among controls, yielding a relative risk of 1.08 (90% confidence interval 0.85 to 1.38, p = 0.29). The relative risk of death from causes other than cancer was 0.96 (0.71 to 1.29, p = 0.59) whereas the relative risk of death from cancer was 1.38 (0.90 to 2.10, p = 0.09) and of the incidence of cancer was 1.12 (0.78 to 1.60, p = 0.29). For cancers other than haematological malignancies the relative risk was 1.14 (0.69 to 1.83, p = 0.31) for mortality and 1.01 (0.67 to 1.50, p = 0.48) for incidence. There were seven deaths from haematological cancers among test participants (relative risk 3.25, 90% confidence interval 1.12 to 9.64, p = 0.02), including four leukaemias (5.58, 1.04 to 41.6, p = 0.03). The relative risk for incidence of haematological cancers was 1.94 (0.74 to 4.84, p = 0.10) and that for leukaemia was 5.51 (1.03 to 41.1, p = 0.03). There were no cases of multiple myeloma in the test participants during the follow up period, but the expected number was only 0.3. CONCLUSIONS: Although the numbers are small, the findings for leukaemia are similar to those for British participants in the nuclear weapons test programme. Some leukaemias, and possibly some other haematological cancers, may have resulted from participation in this programme. There is little evidence of an increased risk for non-haematological cancers, and there is no evidence of an increased risk for causes of death other than cancer.","['Pearce, N', 'Prior, I', 'Methven, D', 'Culling, C', 'Marshall, S', 'Auld, J', 'de Boer, G', 'Bethwaite, P']","['Pearce N', 'Prior I', 'Methven D', 'Culling C', 'Marshall S', 'Auld J', 'de Boer G', 'Bethwaite P']","['Department of Community Health, Wellington School of Medicine, New Zealand.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,BMJ,BMJ (Clinical research ed.),8900488,,IM,"['Cause of Death', 'Confidence Intervals', 'Follow-Up Studies', '*Health Status', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/mortality', '*Military Personnel', 'Neoplasms/mortality', 'New Zealand/epidemiology', '*Nuclear Warfare', 'Risk', 'United Kingdom']",1990/05/05 00:00,1990/05/05 00:01,['1990/05/05 00:00'],"['1990/05/05 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/05/05 00:01 [medline]', '1990/05/05 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,BMJ. 1990 May 5;300(6733):1161-6. doi: 10.1136/bmj.300.6733.1161.,,['10.1136/bmj.300.6733.1161 [doi]'],,PMC1662929,,,,,,

There was a similar pattern in each of the CGL, ET and CLL groups although this only reached statistical significance in the CGL group. In vitro induction of either mRNA or of enzyme activity, however, did not show a difference between the responders and poor responders in any of the patient groups. Our findings are consistent with the concept that 2-5A has an important role in the anti-tumour activity of alpha IFN and suggest that measurement of in vivo induction of 2-5A synthetase mRNA may be useful in predicting clinical response.

This region of MoMuLV and MoMuLV-TB differs in 11 nucleotides. Of these 11 nucleotide differences, 9 are distributed within the two CORE, the two distal NF1, and the two GRE/LVa elements of the enhancer. Since both the CORE binding sites of MoMuLV-TB are mutated with respect to those of MoMuLV, we compared nuclear proteins of a thymus-bone marrow cell line and a T-lymphoma cell line (EMT), which bind to the wild-type and mutant CORE binding sites. Using both the bandshift assay and southwestern analysis with labeled synthetic deoxyoligonucleotides, we showed that a 42-kDa protein from TB and EMT cells bound specifically to the MoMuLV CORE element. The T----C transversion of nucleotide 6 of the CORE consensus, TGTGGT/CTAA, significantly reduced binding of the 42-kDa TB and EMT cell factors. However, the transversion of nucleotide 3 from T----C had little effect on the binding of the 42-kDa protein to the CORE element. In addition, the 42-kDa protein bound weakly to the CCAAT element of MoMuLV. A recombinant virus, NwtTB-6, was generated by introducing the two CORE mutations of MoMuLV-TB into the MoMuLV genome. Although the latency period of NwtTB-6 in the induction of lymphoma was not significantly different from that of MoMuLV, preliminary findings suggest that the lymphoma induced by NwtTB-6 may be more widely distributed.","['Case, R S', 'Khang, Y H', 'Kumar, A', 'Yuen, P H']","['Case RS', 'Khang YH', 'Kumar A', 'Yuen PH']","['Department of Carcinogenesis, University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Smithville 78957.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,Mol Carcinog,Molecular carcinogenesis,8811105,"['0 (DNA Probes)', '0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Transformation, Viral', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'DNA Probes', 'DNA, Viral/analysis', 'Enhancer Elements, Genetic', 'Lymphoma/*genetics/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/*genetics', '*Mutation', 'Nuclear Proteins/*genetics', 'T-Lymphocytes/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1990/01/01 00:00,1990/01/01 00:01,['1990/01/01 00:00'],"['1990/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Mol Carcinog. 1990;3(2):93-102. doi: 10.1002/mc.2940030207.,,['10.1002/mc.2940030207 [doi]'],,,,,,,,

The findings were correlated with treatment variables, the development of fits, and the intelligence quotient (IQ). Reversible brain shrinkage, attributed to treatment with steroids, was found on 87 of 114 initial scans (76%); 14 showed changes in white matter during treatment (10%), and calcification was found in 13 either during or after treatment (10%). Eight children (6%) had fits, and in six of the eight there were changes in white matter or calcification on the scans. Comparison of the two radiotherapy dosages showed no difference in the incidence of abnormalities seen on computed tomography, fits, or serial IQ measurements, but children receiving intramuscular methotrexate had a higher incidence of calcification and a lower mean IQ at one year than those who received the drug orally, although this difference was not apparent later. Younger children were more likely to develop changes on computed tomograms and fits, and to have low IQs on completion of treatment, with changes most apparent in those less than 2 years of age. There were highly significant correlations between abnormalities on computed tomography, fits, and IQ. These findings confirm the neurological vulnerability of younger children with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia, show an association between abnormalities on computed tomography and intellectual deficit, and suggest that methotrexate is more toxic when given intramuscularly than orally. They provide no evidence that 18 Gy of cranial irradiation is less toxic than 24 Gy, and indicate the need for alternative treatment regimens.","['Chessells, J M', 'Cox, T C', 'Kendall, B', 'Cavanagh, N P', 'Jannoun, L', 'Richards, S']","['Chessells JM', 'Cox TC', 'Kendall B', 'Cavanagh NP', 'Jannoun L', 'Richards S']","['Hospital for Sick Children, London.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Comparative Study', 'Controlled Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Arch Dis Child,Archives of disease in childhood,0372434,['YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)'],IM,"['Administration, Oral', 'Brain/diagnostic imaging/drug effects/*radiation effects', 'Brain Diseases/etiology', 'Calcinosis/etiology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Injections, Intramuscular', 'Injections, Spinal', 'Intelligence Tests', 'Methotrexate/administration & dosage/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/radiotherapy/*therapy', 'Radiotherapy/*adverse effects', 'Random Allocation', 'Tomography, X-Ray Computed']",1990/04/01 00:00,1990/04/01 00:01,['1990/04/01 00:00'],"['1990/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Arch Dis Child. 1990 Apr;65(4):416-22. doi: 10.1136/adc.65.4.416.,,['10.1136/adc.65.4.416 [doi]'],,PMC1792187,,,,,,

In the present study we show that Texas-Red (TR) can be advantageously used for the same purpose because: (i) it possesses fluorescence spectra compatible with the simultaneous use of various fluorochromes; (ii) staining is rapid; (iii) it is a viability marker. TR uptake is realized through an active, energy dependent transport across the membrane. This new technique was applied to exponentially growing HL60 and their differentiated counterparts. We show that membrane permeability varies throughout the cell cycle progression and during differentiation. We also show that TR uptake is different between sensitive and cytotoxic drug resistant cells. This technique could be used, in anticancer pharmacology, to correlate phase specificity of cytotoxic drugs with membrane permeability, to understand better the mechanism of action of differentiating agents, and to document the apparition of resistant clones within populations of cells.","['Leonce, S', 'Cudennec, C A']","['Leonce S', 'Cudennec CA']","['Institut de Recherches Servier, Suresnes, France.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Greece,Anticancer Res,Anticancer research,8102988,"['0 (Azides)', '0 (Xanthenes)', '82354-19-6 (Texas red)', '968JJ8C9DV (Sodium Azide)', 'KOO5CM684H (Digitonin)']",IM,"['Azides/pharmacology', 'Cell Cycle', 'Cell Differentiation', '*Cell Membrane Permeability/drug effects', 'Digitonin/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/metabolism/*pathology', 'Sodium Azide', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/metabolism/pathology', '*Xanthenes/pharmacokinetics']",1990/03/01 00:00,1990/03/01 00:01,['1990/03/01 00:00'],"['1990/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Anticancer Res. 1990 Mar-Apr;10(2A):369-74.,,,,,,,,,,

Using the highest noncytotoxic concentrations of three modulators; 2 calcium channel blockers, Verapamil (VEP) and DMDP and a nucleoside transport inhibitor, Dipyridamole (DIP), restoration of Doxorubicin (DOX) sensitivity in vitro against P388/R cells was partial; resistance was reduced from approximately 200 to 10 fold, although DOX accumulation in the resistant cells in the presence of the modulators was completely restored. The DNA single-strand break (SSB) level induced by DOX in P388/S cells (1371 +/- 144 rad equivalents) was significantly higher than in P388/R cells (74 +/- 17 rad equivalents). The effects of VEP, DMDP and DIP on the induction of DNA SSBs by DOX in P388/R were different. DMDP and DIP potentiated the DOX-induced DNA SSBs by 30% each and VEP by 15%. Furthermore, while VEP and DIP had no significant effects on the rapid repair of DOX-induced SSBs, no significant repair of DNA lesion was observed in P388/R treated with DMDP at 1.2 microM, a non-cytotoxic concentration. These data indicate that although these modulators can effectively restore the intracellular accumulation and retention of DOX, these conditions although essential are not sufficient for the complete restoration of DOX sensitivity in this highly resistant cll line. The ability of a calcium antagonist, DMDP, to circumvent DOX resistance might be related not only to the modulation of drug retention, but also to the ability to retard the repair of DOX-induced DNA SSBs.","['Yin, M B', 'Bankusli, I', 'Frank, C', 'Rustum, Y M']","['Yin MB', 'Bankusli I', 'Frank C', 'Rustum YM']","['Grace Cancer Drug Center, Roswell Park Memorial Institute, Buffalo, NY 14263.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Greece,Anticancer Res,Anticancer research,8102988,"['0 (Alkaloids)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Imino Furanoses)', '0 (Pyrrolidines)', '3OWL53L36A (Mannitol)', '59920-31-9 (2,5-dihydroxymethyl-3,4-dihydroxypyrrolidine)', '64ALC7F90C (Dipyridamole)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', 'CJ0O37KU29 (Verapamil)']",IM,"['Alkaloids/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Cell Line', 'DNA Repair/*drug effects', 'DNA, Neoplasm/*drug effects', 'Dipyridamole/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Doxorubicin/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Drug Resistance/genetics', 'Imino Furanoses', 'Leukemia P388/genetics/metabolism', 'Mannitol/analogs & derivatives', '*Pyrrolidines', 'Verapamil/metabolism/*pharmacology']",1990/03/01 00:00,1990/03/01 00:01,['1990/03/01 00:00'],"['1990/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Anticancer Res. 1990 Mar-Apr;10(2A):327-32.,"['CA18420/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA21071/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA24538/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,

Extramedullary relapses usually occur in ""sequestered sites,"" i.e., the testis and central nervous system. Although the true incidence of extramedullary relapse in ""nonsequestered"" sites after allogeneic BMT for ANLL is unknown, it appears that this type of relapse is distinctly unusual. The authors present a case of an unusual extramedullary relapse of ANLL in the breast at day +613 after allogeneic BMT for ANLL.

The study consisted of 132 male and 144 female rats taken from control groups at the termination of seven, 2-year National Toxicology Program (NTP) carcinogenicity studies. A minimum of 10 male and 10 female rats were killed at 6, 9, 12, 15, and 18 months into the seven NTP studies to assess progressive development of AHF. At the end of the studies, 43 males and 35 females had histologic evidence of mononuclear cell leukemia in the liver. There were no differences in the morphologic features of AHF between leukemic and non-leukemic rats; however, there was a decreased incidence of clear AHF in both sexes and in basophilic, vacuolated, and mixed-cell AHF in males. Stereologic analysis revealed that there was also a 40 to 73% reduction in the density of basophilic, clear, vacuolated, and mixed-cell AHF in male rats with leukemia and a 31 and 70% reduction in basophilic and clear AHF, respectively, in females with leukemia. The number of eosinophilic AHF was statistically unchanged in both sexes. The eosinophilic AHF, however, were 2.3 times larger and occupied a 4.3-fold greater volume fraction of the liver in leukemic male rats. Changes in the incidence and density of AHF were directly associated with the severity of the leukemia.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","['Harada, T', 'Maronpot, R R', 'Morris, R W', 'Boorman, G A']","['Harada T', 'Maronpot RR', 'Morris RW', 'Boorman GA']","['Mitsukaido Laboratories, Institute of Environmental Toxicology, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Vet Pathol,Veterinary pathology,0312020,,IM,"['Animals', 'Female', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/pathology/*veterinary', 'Liver/*pathology', 'Male', 'Rats', '*Rats, Inbred F344', '*Rats, Inbred Strains', 'Rodent Diseases/*pathology']",1990/03/01 00:00,1990/03/01 00:01,['1990/03/01 00:00'],"['1990/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Vet Pathol. 1990 Mar;27(2):110-6. doi: 10.1177/030098589002700206.,,['10.1177/030098589002700206 [doi]'],,,,,,,,

We conclude that the CSF-FN test at diagnosis of ALL showed significant differences between groups of patients with and without CNS leukemia, and may prove to be a new early marker for neuroleukemia.","['Koskiniemi, M', 'Rajantie, J', 'Rautonen, J', 'Laipio, M L', 'Salonen, E M', 'Siimes, M A', 'Vaheri, A']","['Koskiniemi M', 'Rajantie J', 'Rautonen J', 'Laipio ML', 'Salonen EM', 'Siimes MA', 'Vaheri A']","[""Children's Hospital, Helsinki, Finland.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Fibronectins)']",IM,"['Analysis of Variance', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*cerebrospinal fluid', 'Brain Neoplasms/*diagnosis', 'Chi-Square Distribution', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Fibronectins/*cerebrospinal fluid', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*diagnosis', 'Prognosis', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'Recurrence', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Spinal Cord Neoplasms/*diagnosis']",1990/01/01 00:00,1990/01/01 00:01,['1990/01/01 00:00'],"['1990/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 1990;14(5):449-52. doi: 10.1016/0145-2126(90)90031-4.,,['10.1016/0145-2126(90)90031-4 [doi]'],,,,,,,,

The cytotoxic effects of BMY-28175 were determined using murine and human tumor cell lines in vitro. Following 72 hour exposure, the drug had IC50 values 1.5 to 13.5 ng/ml in a microtiter assay. BMY-28175 was evaluated for antitumor activity against several experimental murine and human tumor models. The drug administered ip was active against ip implanted P388 leukemia, L1210 leukemia, B16 melanoma, M109 lung carcinoma, C26 colon carcinoma, M5076 sarcoma and Lewis lung carcinoma. In addition, BMY-28175 administered iv was active against iv implanted P388 and L1210 leukemias. BMY-28175 was active against sc implanted B16 melanoma (increased lifespan and/or inhibition of primary tumor growth) in about 60% of the tests. The growth of sc implanted M109 was inhibited by BMY-28175 in a single experiment. BMY-28175 was also active against the MX-1 human mammary xenograft implanted in the subrenal capsule of nude mice. The optimal dose for BMY-28175 in these various studies ranged from 0.16 micrograms/kg per injection with consecutive daily (qd1-9) administration, to 51.2 micrograms/kg with single dose administration.

This effect was unassociated with any alteration in cell viability. HL60 cells which were pre-incubated with 15 micrograms/ml phenytoin sodium for 1 or 48 h and then incubated with the same concentration of the drug plus either 3H-methotrexate (3H-MTX) or 57Co-cyanocobalamin for 90 min, showed an altered accumulation of both radioactive compounds when compared with control cells. Control cells were not pre-incubated with the drug and were subsequently studied in the absence of the drug. Pre-incubation with the drug for 1 h resulted in a 34% increase, and pre-incubation for 48 h in a 19% reduction in the accumulation of 3H-MTX. Pre-incubation for 1 or 48 h caused a 29% reduction in the accumulation of 57Co-cyanocobalamin. Cells cultured in the presence of 15 micrograms/ml phenytoin sodium for 48 h also gave a slightly increased deoxyuridine-suppressed value; this abnormality was partially corrected by the addition of 50 micrograms/ml folinic acid to the test system but was unaffected by the addition of 1 microgram/ml cyanocobalamin. The data indicate that the effects of phenytoin sodium on the proliferation of HL60 cells may have been slightly mediated via a reduced uptake of folate and possibly also of vitamin B12. They also suggest that one of the mechanisms underlying some of the undesirable effects of long-term therapy with phenytoin may be a drug-related impairment of both folate and vitamin B12 uptake by certain cells, including haemopoietic and neural cells.","['Latham, J', 'Gill, D S', 'Wickramasinghe, S N']","['Latham J', 'Gill DS', 'Wickramasinghe SN']","[""Department of Haematology, St Mary's Hospital Medical School, University of London.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Clin Lab Haematol,Clinical and laboratory haematology,7907061,"['0 (Cobalt Radioisotopes)', '10028-17-8 (Tritium)', '6158TKW0C5 (Phenytoin)', '935E97BOY8 (Folic Acid)', 'P6YC3EG204 (Vitamin B 12)', 'W78I7AY22C (Deoxyuridine)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cobalt Radioisotopes', 'Deoxyuridine', 'Folic Acid/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Methotrexate/*metabolism', 'Phenytoin/*pharmacology', 'Tritium', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Vitamin B 12/*metabolism']",1990/01/01 00:00,1990/01/01 00:01,['1990/01/01 00:00'],"['1990/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Clin Lab Haematol. 1990;12(1):67-75. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2257.1990.tb01112.x.,,['10.1111/j.1365-2257.1990.tb01112.x [doi]'],,,,,,,,

Unlike the comparable spermidine (SPD) analogue N1N8-bis(ethyl)spermidine, which regulates only ODC, BESPM suppresses both ODC and AdoMetDC activities. With 1 microM-SPM or -BESPM, near-maximal suppression of enzyme activity (i.e. less than 70%) was achieved after 2 h for ODC and 12 h for AdoMetDC. After such treatment, ODC activity fully recovered within 2-4 h, and that of AdoMetDC within 12 h, when cells were reseeded into drug-free media. It was deduced that an intracellular accumulation of BESPM or SPM equivalent to only approximately 200-450 pmol/10(6) cells was sufficient to fully invoke ODC regulatory mechanisms. Decreases in both enzyme activities after BESPM or SPM treatment were closely paralleled by concomitant decreases in the amount of enzyme protein. Since cellular ODC or AdoMetDC mRNA was not similarly decreased by either BESPM or SPM treatment, it was concluded that translational and/or post-translational mechanisms were probably responsible for enzyme regulation. In support of the former of these possibilities, it was demonstrated that both BESPM and SPM preferentially inhibited the translation in vitro of ODC and AdoMetDC relative to albumin in a reticulocyte-lysate system. On the basis of the consistent similarities between BESPM and SPM in all parameters studied, it is concluded that the analogue most likely acts by mechanisms identical with those by which SPM acts in suppressing polyamine biosynthesis.","['Porter, C W', 'Pegg, A E', 'Ganis, B', 'Madhabala, R', 'Bergeron, R J']","['Porter CW', 'Pegg AE', 'Ganis B', 'Madhabala R', 'Bergeron RJ']","['Grace Cancer Drug Center, Roswell Park Memorial Institute, Buffalo, NY 14263.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Biochem J,The Biochemical journal,2984726R,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Ornithine Decarboxylase Inhibitors)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '2FZ7Y3VOQX (Spermine)', '61345-84-4 (N(1), N(12)-diethylspermine)', 'EC 4.1.1.- (Carboxy-Lyases)', 'EC 4.1.1.17 (Ornithine Decarboxylase)', 'EC 4.1.1.50 (Adenosylmethionine Decarboxylase)']",IM,"['Adenosylmethionine Decarboxylase/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Carboxy-Lyases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia L1210', 'Mice', 'Ornithine Decarboxylase/genetics/metabolism', '*Ornithine Decarboxylase Inhibitors', 'Protein Biosynthesis/drug effects', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Spermine/*analogs & derivatives/*pharmacology', 'Transcription, Genetic/drug effects', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1990/05/15 00:00,1990/05/15 00:01,['1990/05/15 00:00'],"['1990/05/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/05/15 00:01 [medline]', '1990/05/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Biochem J. 1990 May 15;268(1):207-12. doi: 10.1042/bj2680207.,"['CA-18138/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-22153/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-37606/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",['10.1042/bj2680207 [doi]'],,PMC1131413,,,,,,

Consequently, neither the presence nor the severity of mucositis is routinely considered in the selection of specific antibacterial agents for the initial empirical therapy of the febrile cancer patient. In a study of children receiving remission induction chemotherapy for acute nonlymphocytic leukemia, the number of febrile days correlated more closely with the degree of mucositis than with the number of days of neutropenia. Oral mucositis appears to predispose cancer patients to systemic infections with alpha-hemolytic streptococci, Capnocytophaga, and Candida species. Overall, studies of single-drug versus combination therapy for the initial empirical therapy of febrile, neutropenic cancer patients indicate that monotherapy approaches the efficacy of combination therapy, although combination therapy may be preferred for certain cohorts of cancer patients. A concern that is closely related to the issue of combination therapy versus monotherapy is the need for vancomycin in the initial empirical regimen. Vancomycin appears to be the consensus drug of choice for patients with known gram-positive bacterial infections pending antibiotic susceptibility testing; however, there is disagreement as to whether the increased activity of vancomycin against gram-positive bacteria outweighs its expense and potential toxicity for inclusion in the initial empirical regimen.

Using both a high pressure liquid chromatography system and a modification of the 5-fluoro-2'-deoxyuridine-5'-monophosphate radioenzymatic binding assay, we determined that the 5,10-methylene-H4PteGlu pool is 50-60% depleted in human MCF-7 breast cancer cells following exposure to 1 micron MTX for up to 21 h. Similar alterations in the 5,10-methylene-H4PteGlu pools were obtained when human promyelocytic HL-60 leukemia cells and normal human myeloid precursor cells were incubated with 1 micron MTX. The H2PteGlu pools within the MCF-7 cells increased significantly after 15 min of 1 micron MTX exposure, reaching maximal levels by 60 min. Thymidylate synthesis, as measured by labeled deoxyuridine incorporation into DNA, decreased to less than 20% of control activity within 30 min of 1 micron MTX exposure. The inhibition of thymidylate synthesis coincided temporally with the rapid intracellular accumulation of H2PteGlu, a known inhibitor of thymidylate synthase. Furthermore, inhibition of this pathway was associated in a log-linear fashion with the intracellular level of dihydrofolate. These studies provide further evidence that depletion of the thymidylate synthase substrate 5,10-methylene-H4PteGlu is inadequate to account completely for diminished thymidylate synthesis resulting from MTX treatment. Our findings suggest that acute inhibition of de novo thymidylate synthesis is a multifactorial process consisting of partial substrate depletion and direct enzymatic inhibition by H2PteGlu polyglutamates.","['Chu, E', 'Drake, J C', 'Boarman, D', 'Baram, J', 'Allegra, C J']","['Chu E', 'Drake JC', 'Boarman D', 'Baram J', 'Allegra CJ']","['Division of Cancer Treatment, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland 20892.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['935E97BOY8 (Folic Acid)', 'EC 2.1.1.45 (Thymidylate Synthase)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Breast Neoplasms', 'Cell Line', 'Female', 'Folic Acid/metabolism', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*enzymology', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute', 'Methotrexate/*pharmacology', 'Thymidylate Synthase/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/*enzymology']",1990/05/25 00:00,1990/05/25 00:01,['1990/05/25 00:00'],"['1990/05/25 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/05/25 00:01 [medline]', '1990/05/25 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1990 May 25;265(15):8470-8.,,['S0021-9258(19)38912-4 [pii]'],,,,,,,,

AFTR is present on all malignant human B-cell lines tested except those of plasma cells and on malignant B cells from 49/49 patients, including those with pre-B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Similarly, AFTR is found on all CD19+ B cells from normal bone marrow, peripheral blood, and tonsil, although it is only weakly expressed on Epstein-Barr virus-transformed normal B cells. AFTR is not expressed on T lymphocytes, thymocytes, myelocytes, monocytes, granulocytes, or erythrocytes, or on endothelial or epithelial cells. Isolation of AFTR from surface-iodinated cells by immune precipitation and sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis reveals bands at 38 and 42 kd in the acute lymphoblastic leukemia cell lines Laz 221 and NALM-6. Molecular weights of these two bands vary slightly between different B-cell populations but change little under reducing and nonreducing conditions. In contrast, relative intensities of these bands vary considerably between different B-cell populations. Like the B-cell-specific surface immunoglobulin and CD19 antigens, but unlike CD20, expression of AFTR is specifically reduced or modulated when cells are incubated with monoclonal antibodies at 37 degrees C. The molecular weight, behavior, and cellular distribution of AFTR are distinct from those of known B-cell surface antigens. One of these MoAbs (J3-109) is a prototype reagent for the CD72 antigen cluster.","['Pesando, J M', 'Stucki, M A']","['Pesando JM', 'Stucki MA']","['Division of Clinical Immunology, Biomembrane Institute, Seattle, Washington.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Hum Immunol,Human immunology,8010936,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, B-Lymphocyte)', '0 (CD72 protein, human)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/immunology', 'Antigens, CD/biosynthesis/immunology/*isolation & purification', 'Antigens, Differentiation, B-Lymphocyte/biosynthesis/immunology/*isolation & purification', 'B-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Membrane/immunology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/immunology', 'Humans', 'Hybridomas', 'Leukemia/immunology', 'Lymphoma/immunology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Precipitin Tests']",1990/03/01 00:00,1990/03/01 00:01,['1990/03/01 00:00'],"['1990/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Hum Immunol. 1990 Mar;27(3):193-207. doi: 10.1016/0198-8859(90)90050-y.,,"['0198-8859(90)90050-Y [pii]', '10.1016/0198-8859(90)90050-y [doi]']",,,,,,,,

The studies described in this report indicate that mice infected with FLV have an increased susceptibility to subsequent infection with the opportunistic pathogen Candida albicans, as measured by increased numbers of C. albicans CFU in the kidneys of FLV-infected mice relative to uninfected controls. Experiments in which the NB-tropic and N-tropic strains of FLV were used suggest that virus replication or the resulting virus burden may be important in the observed increased susceptibility to C. albicans. Since neutrophils are believed to be important in the response of mice to systemic Candida infections, the effect of FLV infection on neutrophil candidacidal activity was investigated. The percentage of neutrophils present in unfractionated Proteose Peptone-elicited peritoneal exudates of mice infected with FLV for 14 days was significantly lower than in uninfected control mice or mice infected with FLV for 6 or 10 days. When neutrophils from FLV-infected and control mice were purified, adjusted to equal concentrations, and tested for in vitro candidacidal activity, neutrophils from mice infected with FLV for 14 days were deficient in their ability to kill C. albicans relative to normal controls and mice infected with FLV for 6 or 10 days. Addition of normal mouse serum increased killing in all groups but did not restore candidacidal activity of neutrophils from mice infected with FLV for 14 days to levels of control neutrophils or neutrophils from mice infected for 6 or 10 days with the virus. These results suggest a defect in neutrophil function, at the later stages of FLV infection, involving in vitro candidacidal activity. In addition, neutrophils from FLV-infected mice may be deficient in in vivo chemotactic activity.

These events were associated with efflux of 51chromium (from prelabeled cells), influx of propidium iodide, and ultrastructural evidence of cellular damage. Target cell lysis was inhibited by procedures which may interfere with the initial interaction of the toxin with the plasma membrane. For example, washing cultures (to dilute and remove toxin) or the addition of monoclonal antibodies (to neutralize toxin) or trypsin (to inactivate toxin) limited lysis when undertaken within the first 5 min of the reaction. The extent of injury was also diminished when radiolabeled HL-60 cells were exposed to toxin in the presence of unlabeled, toxin-sensitive cells (e.g., HL-60 cells or human neutrophils) or certain toxin-resistant target cells (e.g., human K562 erythroleukemia cells). This suggests that the association of the toxin with the cell membrane may not be sufficient to cause lysis without activation of additional effector mechanisms. The addition of specific trivalent (e.g., La3+) or divalent (e.g., Ca2+ and Zn2+) cations to toxin-treated cells appeared to enhance their capacity to repair or minimize the extent of toxin-mediated membrane damage. Depending on size, certain saccharides served as osmotic protectants: maltose almost completely inhibited radiolabel release, while smaller molecules provided correspondingly less protection. The results imply that the leukotoxin has membranolytic activity, producing pores in target cells with a functional diameter approximately the size of maltose (0.96 nm).","['Iwase, M', 'Lally, E T', 'Berthold, P', 'Korchak, H M', 'Taichman, N S']","['Iwase M', 'Lally ET', 'Berthold P', 'Korchak HM', 'Taichman NS']","['Department of Oral Surgery, School of Dental Medicine, Showa University, Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Infect Immun,Infection and immunity,0246127,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Cations)', '0 (Exotoxins)', '0 (Monosaccharides)', '0 (leukotoxin)', 'EC 3.4.21.4 (Trypsin)']",IM,"['Actinobacillus/*pathogenicity', 'Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Cations/pharmacology', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Exotoxins/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Leukocytes/*drug effects', 'Microscopy, Electron', 'Monosaccharides/pharmacology', 'Osmolar Concentration', 'Rabbits', 'Trypsin/pharmacology']",1990/06/01 00:00,1990/06/01 00:01,['1990/06/01 00:00'],"['1990/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Infect Immun. 1990 Jun;58(6):1782-8. doi: 10.1128/iai.58.6.1782-1788.1990.,"['DE 07118/DE/NIDCR NIH HHS/United States', 'DE 08239/DE/NIDCR NIH HHS/United States', 'DE 09517/DE/NIDCR NIH HHS/United States']",['10.1128/iai.58.6.1782-1788.1990 [doi]'],,PMC258723,,,,,,

The rate of accumulation of dFdC triphosphate was linear up to 3 h and maximal during incubation with 10 microM dFdC (92 microM/h). Deoxynucleotides analyzed at this time showed a decrease in dCTP, dATP, and dGTP levels, indicating an inhibitory role of dFdC nucleotides in ribonucleotide reduction. We evaluated the hypothesis that dFdC-mediated deoxyribonucleoside triphosphate perturbation enhances the phosphorylation of substrates that use deoxycytidine kinase or deoxyguanosine kinase, because these enzymes are inhibited by dCTP or dGTP, respectively. When the activity of these nucleoside kinases was rate limiting to triphosphate formation, the accumulation of triphosphates of deoxycytidine, 1-beta-D-arabinofuranosylcytosine, and 1-beta-D-arabinofuranosylguanine was potentiated in cells pretreated with dFdC. In contrast, the phosphorylation of 9-beta-D-arabinofuranosyladenine was not affected, since it is mainly phosphorylated by adenosine kinase, which is not influenced by deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates. Treatment of cells with dFdC followed by 1-beta-D-arabinofuranosylcytosine resulted in greater cytotoxicity than sum effects of each drug alone. The data indicate that an enhanced cytotoxicity could be obtained by administering dFdC as a modulator followed by 1-beta-D-arabinofuranosylcytosine or 1-beta-D-arabinofuranosylguanine in optimal sequence, suggesting that these results should be considered in the design of combination clinical protocols.","['Gandhi, V', 'Plunkett, W']","['Gandhi V', 'Plunkett W']","['Department of Medical Oncology, University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston 77030.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Arabinonucleosides)', '0 (Arabinonucleotides)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '0W860991D6 (Deoxycytidine)', '38819-10-2 (9-arabinofuranosylguanine)', '74832-57-8 (2-fluoro-araATP)', 'B76N6SBZ8R (gemcitabine)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)']",IM,"['Arabinonucleosides/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'Arabinonucleotides/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Cytarabine/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Deoxycytidine/*analogs & derivatives/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/metabolism', 'Vidarabine/metabolism/pharmacology']",1990/06/15 00:00,1990/06/15 00:01,['1990/06/15 00:00'],"['1990/06/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/06/15 00:01 [medline]', '1990/06/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 1990 Jun 15;50(12):3675-80.,['CA 28596/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,

Previous work had shown that the in vitro antitumor activity of the model AMAP crisnatol was a function of exposure (Cn x T), rather than concentration alone. A unique exposure parameter, the minimum C x T, was proposed as an end point for antitumor activity in cell culture. Comparison of crisnatol to several established agents by the minimum C x T versus the standard concentration producing 10% survival indicated that these end points were not equivalent. The current work examined the validity of the pharmacodynamic approach using AMAP isomers from three different ring systems that were known to exhibit a spectrum of activity against the P388 tumor in vivo. The results indicated that antiproliferative, but not cytotoxic, activity of AMAPs in the pharmacodynamic assay correlated with their differential activity in vivo, expressed as percentage of increase in life span. In contrast, the concentration producing 10% survival either at 1 h or after continuous exposure did not show a similar correlation. The pharmacodynamic assay also revealed that certain AMAPs, while equipotent by concentration alone, required significantly less time and therefore less overall exposure for efficacy. Finally, the activity of AMAP isomers in P388 cells differed from that in MCF-7 cells, which may indicate AMAP selectivity for certain tumor types. Since AMAP action was a function of exposure, drug effects on cellular targets could likewise depend on exposure rather than concentration. These findings emphasize the importance of relating drug mechanisms to the pharmacodynamics of anticancer agents.","['Adams, D J', 'Watkins, P J', 'Knick, V C', 'Tuttle, R L', 'Bair, K W']","['Adams DJ', 'Watkins PJ', 'Knick VC', 'Tuttle RL', 'Bair KW']","['Division of Cell Biology, Burroughs Wellcome, Research Triangle Park, North Carolina 27709.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Anthracenes)', '0 (Carbazoles)', '0 (Chrysenes)', '0 (Fluorenes)', '0 (Methylamines)', '0 (Propylene Glycols)', '360UOL779Z (fluoranthene)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Anthracenes/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology', 'Breast Neoplasms/drug therapy/*metabolism', 'Carbazoles/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Chemical Phenomena', 'Chemistry', 'Chrysenes/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology', 'Fluorenes/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia P388/drug therapy/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*metabolism', 'Methylamines/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology', 'Propylene Glycols/*pharmacokinetics/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects/metabolism']",1990/06/15 00:00,1990/06/15 00:01,['1990/06/15 00:00'],"['1990/06/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/06/15 00:01 [medline]', '1990/06/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 1990 Jun 15;50(12):3663-9.,,,,,,,,,,

Overall, the age-adjusted incidence rate of HCL for men (2.9/million population) was 4.8 times greater than that for women (0.6/million population). Using data from all cancer patients diagnosed during the study period, Jewish men had significantly greater risk of HCL than Protestant men (odds ratio (OR) = 3.0, P less than 0.0001); there was no significant variation in risk of HCL by religion for women. For men, the OR was significantly elevated for professional and technical workers (OR = 2.1, P = 0.001); within this category of occupations, risk was significantly elevated for engineers (OR = 3.3, P less than 0.0001) and university faculty and school teachers (OR = 4.0, P = 0.0008). HCL patients were more than twice as likely to have multiple primary cancer diagnoses as other cancer patients. Since the majority of the other primary cancer diagnoses occurred prior to (greater than 1 year) or concurrent with (less than or equal to 1 year) the HCL diagnosis, this greater frequency of multiple primaries in HCL patients may be due to impaired immune function.","['Bernstein, L', 'Newton, P', 'Ross, R K']","['Bernstein L', 'Newton P', 'Ross RK']","['Department of Preventive Medicine, University of Southern California School of Medicine, Los Angeles 90033.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Hairy Cell/*epidemiology/ethnology', 'Los Angeles/epidemiology/ethnology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Occupations', 'Risk Factors', 'Sex Factors']",1990/06/15 00:00,1990/06/15 00:01,['1990/06/15 00:00'],"['1990/06/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/06/15 00:01 [medline]', '1990/06/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 1990 Jun 15;50(12):3605-9.,['CA17054/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,

In the present study, we have examined the expression of glutathione S-transferases (GST) in both CLL and normal control lymphocytes, as these enzymes have been implicated in mechanisms of natural and acquired resistance. Lymphocyte GST was purified from samples by high-pressure liquid affinity chromatography, and subunits were identified by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and immunoblotting by using polyclonal antibodies specific for individual subunits. Analysis of CLL lymphocyte GST activity using the general substrate 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene showed a statistically significant 2-fold increase in cells from chlorambucil-resistant patients over those from untreated patients and normal individuals. Furthermore, chlorambucil therapy was seen to cause a 1.3- to 1.5-fold elevation of enzyme activity in three previously drug-naive patients. Analysis of GST isozyme subunits indicated that 95% of the CLL patients examined were positive for the pi isozyme, and this appeared quantitatively to be the major isozyme present. The alpha and mu isozymes were also expressed in 63 and 53% of the patients, respectively. Examination of control lymphocytes, as well as separated B- and T-cell subpopulations, yielded similar results. The present study indicates that a high degree of interindividual variation occurs and that the pattern of CLL lymphocyte GST expression differs from that of other tumor tissues. While there were no obvious correlations between the disease state or stage and isozymes expressed, the quantitative increase in GST activity in chlorambucil-resistant CLL patients may be of relevance to the overall resistant phenotype.","['Schisselbauer, J C', 'Silber, R', 'Papadopoulos, E', 'Abrams, K', 'LaCreta, F P', 'Tew, K D']","['Schisselbauer JC', 'Silber R', 'Papadopoulos E', 'Abrams K', 'LaCreta FP', 'Tew KD']","['Department of Pharmacology, Fox Chase Cancer Center, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19111.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Isoenzymes)', '18D0SL7309 (Chlorambucil)', 'EC 2.5.1.18 (Glutathione Transferase)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'B-Lymphocytes/*enzymology', 'Chlorambucil/therapeutic use', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'Female', 'Glutathione Transferase/*analysis', 'Humans', 'Isoenzymes/*analysis', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/drug therapy/*enzymology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Molecular Weight', 'T-Lymphocytes/enzymology']",1990/06/15 00:00,1990/06/15 00:01,['1990/06/15 00:00'],"['1990/06/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/06/15 00:01 [medline]', '1990/06/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 1990 Jun 15;50(12):3562-8.,"['CA06927/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA43830-08/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'RR05539/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,,,

Median survival was only 3.3 months (range 3 days to 8 months). Striking features were observed in bone marrow mature granulocytes: all but one case had a pseudo-Pelger-Huet anomaly in a significant number of granulocytes, and eight patients had granulocytes with reduced size and clear cytoplasmic vacuoles. Careful cytological review of 51 patients with MDS or ANLL and various cytogenetic anomalies was performed for comparison: vacuolated granulocytes were a very uncommon finding.

Bone marrow cell culture and chromosome preparation were performed according to four different protocols used in parallel: methotrexate (MTX)-synchronized or thymidine (TdR)-unsynchronized techniques, and presence or absence of 5637 conditioned medium (CM). Some patients responded better to MTX; others had better results with TdR exposure only. Use of 5637 CM generally improved quantity and quality of metaphases. A cytogenetic result was obtained in 53 cases. 60% of the patients had a chromosome abnormality. Percentage of abnormality varied from one French-American-British (FAB) subtype to the other: 62% in refractory anemia with ringed sideroblasts (RARS, 8/13), 50% in refractory anemia (RA, 6/12), 60% in refractory anemia with excess of blasts (RAEB, 3/5), 77% in refractory anemia with excess of blasts in transformation (RAEB-T, 7/9), and 57% in chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMMoL, 8/14). Chromosome defects were subdivided into three categories: single, two, and complex defects. The most frequent chromosome abnormalities, either single or one of two or complex defects were del(5q) or monosomy 5 (13 cases), trisomy or rearrangement of chromosome 8 (eight cases), total or partial monosomy or rearrangement of chromosome 7 (eight cases), Y loss (seven cases), and del(20q) (two cases). With the exception of del(5q) in macrocytic RA, this study confirms the absence of chromosome defects specific to each FAB category of MDS. Recurrent defects in MDS are relatively limited, however, in terms of chromosomes involved and type of abnormality. Consequently, these defects, mostly of deleted type, are assumed to play a specific role in the genesis of myelodysplasia.","['Jotterand-Bellomo, M', 'Parlier, V', 'Schmidt, P M', 'Beris, P']","['Jotterand-Bellomo M', 'Parlier V', 'Schmidt PM', 'Beris P']","['Division de Genetique Medicale, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire Vandois, Lausanne, Switzerland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Genet Cytogenet,Cancer genetics and cytogenetics,7909240,['0 (Genetic Markers)'],IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', '*Chromosome Aberrations', 'Chromosome Banding', 'Female', 'Genetic Markers', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*genetics']",1990/06/01 00:00,1990/06/01 00:01,['1990/06/01 00:00'],"['1990/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Genet Cytogenet. 1990 Jun;46(2):157-72. doi: 10.1016/0165-4608(90)90101-f.,,"['0165-4608(90)90101-F [pii]', '10.1016/0165-4608(90)90101-f [doi]']",,,,,,,,

Toxicity consisted of allergic reactions to L-asparaginase (n = 12), stomatitis (n = 6), minimal elevation of hepatic enzymes (n = 2), and hyperglycemia (n = 1). Treatment was given on an outpatient basis in 95% of all courses.

All patients except one had splenomegaly (mean (s.d.) weight 1585(872) g, range 150-4300 g) and 34 had massive splenomegaly (greater than 1500 g). Forty-nine patients had platelet counts less than 100 x 10(9)/l and 16 patients had anaemia with haemoglobin levels less than 10 g/dl. White cell counts were less than 3 x 10(9)/l in six NHL patients. Fifteen patients had bicytopenia, and three NHL patients had tricytopenia. The selected group of 62 patients underwent splenectomy largely because of failure to respond to medical therapy (39 patients) or inability to tolerate or start adequate chemotherapy because of very low blood counts (11 patients). There was one postoperative death, and a 29 per cent morbidity rate. The response rate was 89 per cent in the first month after splenectomy and 39 patients (63 per cent) had a continuing complete response with a median follow-up of 26 months (range 3-96 months). Twelve patients (10 with CLL) received no further therapy after splenectomy. Seven patients failed to respond and 15 relapsed after splenectomy. These 22 patients could be distinguished on the basis of: (1) lower average preoperative platelet counts (P less than 0.007), postoperative platelet counts (P less than 0.001), and postoperative rise in platelets (P less than 0.004); (2) lower average spleen weight (P less than 0.052); (3) preoperative chemotherapy (P less than 0.044). However preoperative and postoperative platelet counts were the only two variables selected by stepwise regression analysis (P less than 0.05 and P less than 0.01, respectively). Bone marrow failure did not preclude complete response after splenectomy. Long-term survivors emerged from the group of patients with continuing complete response. Of the seven patients who failed to respond, five died with a median survival of 4 months, and of the 15 patients who relapsed after splenectomy, 13 died, with a median survival of 6 months after relapse and 18 months after splenectomy. Thus, splenectomy may be an effective palliation for both CLL and NHL patients with splenomegaly and hypersplenism.","['Delpero, J R', 'Houvenaeghel, G', 'Gastaut, J A', 'Orsoni, P', 'Blache, J L', 'Guerinel, G', 'Carcassonne, Y']","['Delpero JR', 'Houvenaeghel G', 'Gastaut JA', 'Orsoni P', 'Blache JL', 'Guerinel G', 'Carcassonne Y']","['Department of Surgery, Marseille, France.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Br J Surg,The British journal of surgery,0372553,['0 (Hemoglobins)'],IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Female', 'France/epidemiology', 'Hemoglobins/analysis', 'Humans', 'Hypersplenism/*surgery', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/blood/mortality/*surgery', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/blood/mortality/*surgery', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Platelet Count', 'Postoperative Complications/etiology/mortality', '*Splenectomy']",1990/04/01 00:00,1990/04/01 00:01,['1990/04/01 00:00'],"['1990/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Br J Surg. 1990 Apr;77(4):443-9. doi: 10.1002/bjs.1800770427.,,['10.1002/bjs.1800770427 [doi]'],,,,,['Br J Surg 1990 Aug;77(8):957'],,,

Also, 1,25(OH)2-16-ene-23-yne-D3 is 300 times less active in mediating intestinal calcium absorption and bone calcium mobilization as compared to 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 [1,25(OH)2D3], the physiologically active metabolite.

We explored the therapeutic potential of 1,25(OH)2-16-ene-23-yne-D3 by developing and using the following three leukemia models. (i) Injection of 2.5 x 10(5) myeloid leukemic cells (WEHI 3BD+) into syngeneic BALB/c mice resulted in leukemic death of all diluent-injected mice by day 26. Mice who received the same number of leukemic cells and also received 1,25(OH)2D3 (0.1 micrograms q.o.d., i.p.) had nearly an identical survival curve.

(ii) Injection of 50% fewer leukemic cells (1 x 10(5) cells) into syngeneic BALB/c mice resulted in 86% dead of leukemia at 51 days. Experimental mice who received the same number of leukemic cells and 1,25(OH)2-16-ene-23-yne-D3 (0.8 microgram q.o.d.) had a significantly (P = 0.0006) longer survival than controls; only 53% of the mice were dead by day 100. (iii) After injection of 1.5 x 10(4) leukemic cells, 13% of syngeneic BALB/c mice were free of disease at day 180. In contrast, 43% of mice who received leukemic cells and 1,25(OH)2-16-ene-23-yne-D3 (1.6 micrograms q.o.d.) were still free of disease at day 180.

We report here that inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate-induced calcium release from saponin-permeabilized rat basophilic leukemia cells at 37 degrees C is markedly biphasic, in contrast with nearly monophasic release kinetics at 11 degrees C. Hepatoma, PC-12 neuronal cells, and several other cell types exhibit similar biphasic release at 37 degrees C. The biphasic kinetics are not due to degradation of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate or to increased Ca2(+)-ATPase pump activity. Biphasic calcium release was also seen when ATP was quenched to less than 0.4 microM by adding hexokinase and glucose, suggesting that phosphorylation is not involved. External calcium (100 nM-600 nM) range had little influence on the biphasic kinetics. Rapid-mixing experiments revealed that rapid efflux of calcium is followed in approximately 0.5 s by a 30-fold slower efflux. Most striking, successive additions of the same amount of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate induced short bursts of calcium release of similar size. This retention of responsiveness, which we term increment detection, may be a distinct mode of signal transduction. Like inactivation and adaptation, increment detection gives rise to transient responses to sustained stimuli.

Particularly with hematopoietic/lymphoid proliferations, little is known about how these data compare with data from fresh suspension studies, or how B5-fixed tissues compare with those fixed in formalin. For these reasons, flow-cytometric DNA ploidy and cell cycle analysis was performed on 16 hyperplastic tonsils and 28 lymphoid/hematopoietic neoplasms using fresh (or fresh-frozen) cell suspensions (FR), B5-fixed paraffin-embedded (B5), and formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FO) tissue. Ploidy analysis showed all tonsil specimens to be diploid regardless of preparative method; however, for the neoplastic cases the FO and B5 preparations agreed with the FR preparations in 50% and 61% of the cases, respectively. Complete agreement between all three tissue preparation methods was present in only 36% of the neoplastic cases. Percent S or S + G2M phase fractions showed relatively poor correlation between the three preparative methods, with the best correlations found between the FR and B5 samples (S phase, r = 0.44; S + G2M, r = 0.43). In conclusion, while potentially useful data can be obtained from flow-cytometric DNA analysis of fixed, paraffin-embedded lymphoid/hematopoietic tissues, the specific limitations of such analyses must be recognized. Ploidy and proliferative phase data from fixed tissue preparations are not equivalent to information obtained from fresh suspension studies. B5-fixed tissue provides an acceptable alternative to formalin-fixed tissue for such analyses.","['Pelstring, R J', 'Hurtubise, P E', 'Swerdlow, S H']","['Pelstring RJ', 'Hurtubise PE', 'Swerdlow SH']","['Department of Pathology, University of Cincinnati College of Medicine, OH 45267-0529.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,Hum Pathol,Human pathology,9421547,"['0 (Fixatives)', '1HG84L3525 (Formaldehyde)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",IM,"['Cell Division', 'DNA/*analysis', '*Fixatives', '*Flow Cytometry', 'Formaldehyde', 'Humans', 'Hyperplasia', 'Interphase', 'Leukemia/*pathology', 'Lymphoma/*pathology', 'Palatine Tonsil/pathology', 'Ploidies']",1990/05/01 00:00,1990/05/01 00:01,['1990/05/01 00:00'],"['1990/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Hum Pathol. 1990 May;21(5):551-8. doi: 10.1016/0046-8177(90)90013-u.,,"['0046-8177(90)90013-U [pii]', '10.1016/0046-8177(90)90013-u [doi]']",,,,,,,,

By cluster analysis, it was possible to discriminate subsets of samples according to PTT 119 sensitivity, and to investigate cross resistance with cytosine arabinoside and daunorubicin. This preclinical study indicates that PTT 119 may deserve applications in the treatment of acute nonlymphoblastic leukemia patients.","['Dal Pozzo, O', 'Santini, V', 'Saccardi, R', 'Bernabei, P A', 'Rossi Ferrini, P']","['Dal Pozzo O', 'Santini V', 'Saccardi R', 'Bernabei PA', 'Rossi Ferrini P']","['U.O.

To study the contribution of individual protein-binding sites to viral pathogenicity, we introduced mutations into each of the known nuclear factor-binding sites in the enhancer region of the Moloney murine leukemia virus and injected viruses with these mutations into newborn NFS mice. All viruses induced disease. Viruses with mutations in both copies of the leukemia virus factor a (LVa) site, leukemia virus factor c (LVc) site, or in just the promoter proximal copy of the glucocorticoid response element (GRE) had a latent period of disease onset and disease specificity indistinguishable from that of the wild-type Moloney virus. Viruses with mutations in two or three of the GREs, in both copies of the leukemia virus factor b (LVb) site, in two of the four nuclear factor 1 (NF1) consensus motifs, or in both copies of the conserved viral core element showed a significant delay in latent period of disease induction. Strikingly, viruses with mutations in the core element induced primarily erythroleukemias, and mutations in the LVb site also resulted in a significant incidence of erythroleukemias. These and other genetic and biochemical studies suggest models for how subtle alterations in the highly conserved structure of mouse C-type retrovirus enhancers can produce a dramatic effect on disease specificity.","['Speck, N A', 'Renjifo, B', 'Golemis, E', 'Fredrickson, T N', 'Hartley, J W', 'Hopkins, N']","['Speck NA', 'Renjifo B', 'Golemis E', 'Fredrickson TN', 'Hartley JW', 'Hopkins N']","['Biology Department, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge 02139.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Genes Dev,Genes & development,8711660,"['0 (DNA, Viral)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'DNA, Viral/genetics', '*Enhancer Elements, Genetic', 'Leukemia, Experimental/etiology', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/*genetics/pathogenicity', 'Mutation', 'Repetitive Sequences, Nucleic Acid', 'Time Factors']",1990/02/01 00:00,1990/02/01 00:01,['1990/02/01 00:00'],"['1990/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Genes Dev. 1990 Feb;4(2):233-42. doi: 10.1101/gad.4.2.233.,"['N01-A1-72622/PHS HHS/United States', 'P01-CA42063/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01-CA19308/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",['10.1101/gad.4.2.233 [doi]'],,,,,,,,

Donor marrow was depleted of T cells by incubation with monoclonal antibodies of the Campath series. Fourteen (88%) of 16 evaluable patients had sustained engraftment. Four (27%) of the 15 evaluable patients developed acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) of grade II or greater, and 4 of 12 evaluable patients developed chronic GVHD. Three patients developed hematological and two developed cytogenetic evidence of relapse. Eight patients (47%) survive at a median follow-up of 32 months (range 10-51 months), giving an actuarial survival of 44%. Five patients remain alive without evidence of hematological or cytogenetic relapse, giving an actuarial disease-free survival of 27%.

Among 46 patients undergoing antineoplastic treatment, 18 developed an intraoral ulcer during the prospective study. Patients with or without ulcers were comparable with respect to underlying disease, presence of teeth, the qualitative composition of the aerobic and facultatively anaerobic oral microflora, herpes simplex virus (HSV) titer positivity, a past history of herpes labialis, leukocyte and thrombocyte counts, and duration of fever. Viral cultures from saliva revealed an association between the presence of HSV in saliva and the presence of intraoral ulcers. HSV was not isolated from the saliva of any patient without ulcers. Viral cultures from the ulcers revealed growth of HSV in 11 (61%) of the 18 patients with ulcers. HSV-positive ulcers were located more often on the alveolar process than elsewhere in the oral cavity. Ulcers on the lateral borders of the tongue and on the buccal mucosa were found only in dentate patients. Development of intraoral ulcers was not associated with an increase of the HSV titer in serum in any patient.

These findings suggest that expression of the 6-1E and 7-3G genes is related to macrophage-monocytic differentiation and that alterations of these gene expressions in fresh leukemia cells after one hour of TPA treatment are of prognostic significance in predicting the response to therapy.","['Tanaka, Y', 'Shiosaka, T']","['Tanaka Y', 'Shiosaka T']","['First Department of Internal Medicine, School of Medicine, Ehime University, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Cancer Biochem Biophys,Cancer biochemistry biophysics,7506524,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)', 'YOW8V9698H (Dimethyl Sulfoxide)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'DNA, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Dimethyl Sulfoxide/pharmacology', 'Gene Expression/*physiology', 'Genomic Library', 'Granulocytes/physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Experimental', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*genetics/pathology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1990/01/01 00:00,1990/01/01 00:01,['1990/01/01 00:00'],"['1990/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Biochem Biophys. 1990 Jan;11(1):79-92.,,,,,,,,,,

The relative risk of overt leukemia was 339 (95% CI: 41-1223), as two cases were observed versus 0.0059 cases expected. The very high risk of leukemia and preleukemia observed may partly reflect the advanced age of the patients (mean, 61 years) and partly the diagnostic procedures used, which included cytogenetic screening of all patients developing refractory cytopenia. A particularly high leukemogenic effect of prednimustine or a synergism between prednimustine and other drugs used in this study cannot be excluded.

In multivariate analysis, the only significant variable was the presence or absence of splenomegaly. Splenomegaly was significantly correlated with delayed engraftment and graft failure. Patients with delayed engraftment experienced higher mortality, largely due to sepsis.

Since this fusion gene gives rise to a chimeric tyrosine protein kinase with transforming potential, and since the bcr exon contribution to this chimeric protein is variable, the question has arisen as to whether bcr breakpoint location and bcr exon contribution could influence the clinical course of CML. Prior studies have yielded conflicting results on this point. Here we have looked, in a manner approximating a prospective analysis, at the relation of bcr breakpoint localization to the duration of chronic phase, total survival, and blast crisis phenotype in 81 patients presenting in the chronic phase of CML. We have found no significant differences in chronic phase duration or total survival among patients with breakpoints in the three major subregions of a breakpoint cluster region within the bcr gene. These findings indicate that chronic phase duration and total survival cannot be predicted from bcr breakpoint for CML patients presenting in chronic phase and suggest that unknown oncogenic events determining the onset of blast crisis are the prime determinants of prognosis. Combined analysis of blast crisis cell lineage in our patients and patients presented in a previous study has revealed an overall ratio of myeloid:lymphoid (M:L) crisis of 3.4:1, but a striking predominance of myeloid crisis in patients with breakpoints in subregion 2 (M:L of 9:1), and a lower than expected M:L ratio (1.6:1) among patients with breakpoints in subregion 3 (P for subregion 2 versus 3 = .012; subregions 0,1,2 versus 3 = .012; subregions 0,1,3 versus 2 = .032). The molecular basis for this divergence from the anticipated M:L ratio in patients with breakpoints in bcr subregions 2 and 3 is unknown.","['Morris, S W', 'Daniel, L', 'Ahmed, C M', 'Elias, A', 'Lebowitz, P']","['Morris SW', 'Daniel L', 'Ahmed CM', 'Elias A', 'Lebowitz P']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Yale Medical School, New Haven, CT 06510.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,,IM,"['Adult', 'Blast Crisis/*pathology', 'Chromosome Aberrations/*genetics', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 22/*ultrastructure', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 9/*ultrastructure', 'DNA Damage', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Introns', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*genetics/mortality/pathology', 'Male', 'Prognosis']",1990/05/15 00:00,1990/05/15 00:01,['1990/05/15 00:00'],"['1990/05/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/05/15 00:01 [medline]', '1990/05/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 1990 May 15;75(10):2035-41.,"['CA-21765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-49238/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",['S0006-4971(20)84335-3 [pii]'],,,,,,"['Blood. 1992 Feb 1;79(3):838-9.

Western blot analysis and flow cytometric analysis of four murine cell lines with known ALDH levels were used to establish the relation between ALDH content and fluorescence with an affinity-purified anti-mouse ALDH antibody. An affinity purified anti-human ALDH antibody, characterized by immunoblotting of cytosolic extracts of cell lines with known ALDH content, was used to determine relative ALDH levels in the marrow subpopulations. We found that hematopoietic progenitor cells express the highest level of ALDH, while lymphocytes express the lowest level.

Comparisons were made with the general United States population, the regional population, and with a group of 26,965 unexposed men from the same plants. Comparisons with general United States death rates showed fewer deaths than expected in the EO group due to all causes and for total cancers. There was no statistically significant excess of deaths due to any cause. Seven deaths each due to leukaemia and pancreatic cancer were observed with 3.0 and 4.1 deaths expected. Among the subcohort of men who worked where both average and peak exposure levels were probably highest, however, one death due to pancreatic cancer (0.9 expected) and no deaths due to leukaemia were observed. Four of the seven who died from leukaemia and six of the seven who died from pancreatic cancer had been assigned to the chlorohydrin department where the potential for exposure to EO is judged to have been low. The relative risk of death due to each disease was strongly related to duration of assignments to that department. When men who worked in the chlorohydrin department were excluded, there was no evidence for an association of exposure to EO with pancreatic cancer or leukaemia. Together with the failure to show independent EO associations, the chlorohydrin department results suggest that leukaemia and pancreatic cancer may have been associated primarily with production of ethylene chlorohydrin or propylene chlorohydrin, or both. These results emphasise the importance of examining additional concurrent/asynchronous exposures among human populations exposed to EO.","['Greenberg, H L', 'Ott, M G', 'Shore, R E']","['Greenberg HL', 'Ott MG', 'Shore RE']","['Union Carbide Corporation, Danbury, CT 06817-001.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Br J Ind Med,British journal of industrial medicine,0370637,"['0 (Chlorohydrins)', '753N66IHAN (Ethylene Chlorohydrin)', 'JJH7GNN18P (Ethylene Oxide)', 'W3398732C7 (2-chloro-1-propanol)']",IM,"['Adult', '*Chemical Industry', 'Chlorohydrins/adverse effects', 'Cohort Studies', 'Ethylene Chlorohydrin/adverse effects', 'Ethylene Oxide/*adverse effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/chemically induced/mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms/chemically induced/*mortality', 'Occupational Diseases/chemically induced/*mortality', 'Pancreatic Neoplasms/chemically induced/mortality', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Factors', 'Time Factors', 'United States/epidemiology']",1990/04/01 00:00,1990/04/01 00:01,['1990/04/01 00:00'],"['1990/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Br J Ind Med. 1990 Apr;47(4):221-30. doi: 10.1136/oem.47.4.221.,,['10.1136/oem.47.4.221 [doi]'],,PMC1035141,,,,,,

Hepatotoxicity was calculated as a mean of all AT-measurements (mATMT). Lack of hepatotoxicity was defined as a mATMT less than or equal to 40 IUl-1. A highly significant correlation was demonstrated between the mean AT during the first, second, and third year of MT (r greater than 0.70, P less than 0.00001). mATMT was not related to the mean WBC during MT (r = -0.03, P = 0.36), but was related to the rise in WBC following cessation of therapy (r = 0.24, P = 0.06).

We demonstrate that two known transcription factors, the ubiquitous octamer-binding protein OTF-1 and the erythroid regulatory factor NFE-1, bind to the -194 to -172 region and that their footprints overlap. Binding of OTF-1 to this region is reduced by a mutation at -175 associated with a form of non-deletion hereditary persistence of fetal hemoglobin.

Pretreatment serum ferritin concentrations were found to be normal or slightly decreased in patients with PV, OMS, MM and in the chronic phase of CGL. Patients entering the blastic crisis of CGL had highly increased serum ferritin concentrations. The severity of hyperferritinemia in these patients depended on the cytomorphological type of the blastic crisis. Highest levels of serum ferritin concentration were found in the immature myeloblastic type according to the M1- and M2-type of the FAB-classification of acute leukemias (i.e. 30-fold and 18-fold increased). In contrast, the rise of the serum ferritin concentration in the more mature types of blastic crisis was less pronounced (i.e. nine-fold in the M3-type and six-fold in the M4- and M5-type of blastic crisis). Patients with complete remission after bone marrow transplantation had normal serum ferritin concentrations. Investigation of the intracellular ferritin concentration showed, that the serum ferritin levels paralleled the intracellular ferritin concentration within the leukemic blasts: During the myeloic blastic crisis the intracellular ferritin concentration was found to be 17-fold increased compared to the intracellular ferritin concentrations in the chronic phase of CGL. Thus, our data support the concept that an increased synthesis of ferritin by the leukemic blasts is responsible for the increased serum ferritin concentration during the blastic crisis of CGL.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","['Aulbert, E', 'Fromm, H']","['Aulbert E', 'Fromm H']","['Evangelisches Waldkrankenhaus Spandau, Akademisches Lehrkrankenhaus, Freien Universitat Berlin.']",['ger'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Germany,Med Klin (Munich),"Medizinische Klinik (Munich, Germany : 1983)",8303501,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '9007-73-2 (Ferritins)']",IM,"['Biomarkers, Tumor/*blood', 'Ferritins/*blood', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Megakaryoblastic, Acute/diagnosis', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/diagnosis', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/blood/*diagnosis', 'Polycythemia Vera/diagnosis', 'Primary Myelofibrosis/diagnosis']",1990/03/15 00:00,2000/03/22 09:00,['1990/03/15 00:00'],"['1990/03/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '2000/03/22 09:00 [medline]', '1990/03/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Med Klin (Munich). 1990 Mar 15;85(3):125-31.,,,Ferritin bei myeloproliferativen Erkrankungen.,,,,,,,

Substitution and deletion mutations revealed that two regions of the stem-loops and their secondary structures are essential for rex regulation. Similar secondary structures were found in the corresponding regions of HTLV-2, bovine leukemia virus and human immunodeficiency virus. Furthermore, a sequence of 11 nucleotides in the RXE was found to be conserved in the secondary structures of HTLV-1, HTLV-2, and bovine leukemia virus.

NMR and mass spectrometry suggested a compound with a mass of 357 with the p-benzoquinone moiety bound to the N-1 and N2 positions of deoxyguanosine. Based on these data it is proposed that Adduct 2 is (3'OH)benzetheno(1,N2)deoxyguanosine.

Studies in a xenograft model.,787-91,"The benefits of chemotherapy in the management of early or bilateral retinoblastoma are doubtful and are difficult to study. A xenograft model has been developed in which the therapeutic response of retinoblastoma heterotransplanted to the anterior chambers of nude mouse eyes can be evaluated. Cyclophosphamide has been shown to be the most effective of the conventional agents. The new drug diaziquone was tested in the model against five patient-derived xenografted cell lines, using both systemic (intraperitoneal) and local (eye drops) methods of administration. A total of 359 xenograft tumors in 229 experimental animals were monitored after treatment with intraperitoneal cyclophosphamide, intraperitoneal diaziquone, or local diaziquone. Responses to all three regimens were demonstrated in each of the five xenograft lines. Diaziquone compared favorably with cyclophosphamide as systemically administered chemotherapy. Local diaziquone was as effective as intraperitoneal injection in producing tumor responses. It is suggested that methods for local administration of diaziquone may be adapted to the clinical setting, and that a role for this modality may be found in a combination of nonoperative approaches to the management of small, intraocular tumors.","['White, L']",['White L'],"[""Children's Leukaemia and Cancer Research Unit, Prince of Wales Children's Hospital, Randwick NSW, Australia.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Invest Ophthalmol Vis Sci,Investigative ophthalmology & visual science,7703701,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Aziridines)', '0 (Benzoquinones)', '0 (Ophthalmic Solutions)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'FQL5EUP13W (diaziquone)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Aziridines/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', '*Benzoquinones', 'Cyclophosphamide/therapeutic use', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Eye Neoplasms/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Injections, Intraperitoneal', 'Mice', 'Mice, Nude', 'Ophthalmic Solutions', 'Retinoblastoma/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Transplantation, Heterologous', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1990/05/01 00:00,1990/05/01 00:01,['1990/05/01 00:00'],"['1990/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Invest Ophthalmol Vis Sci. 1990 May;31(5):787-91.,,,,,,,,,,

This risk is lower than the 50% excess reported previously and reflects, in part, the reduced risk among workers first employed after 1965, when hospital exposures to radiation probably were lower than in earlier years. The X-ray workers were employed between 1950 and 1985 and followed for an average of 16.1 years. Significantly elevated risks were seen for leukemia (RR = 2.4, n = 34 cases), and cancers of the esophagus (RR = 5.2, n = 19), liver (RR = 1.8, n = 65), and skin (RR = 2.8, n = 9). Cancers of the breast (RR = 1.5, n = 20), thyroid (RR = 1.7, n = 8), and bone (RR = 7.6, n = 4) also occurred more often than expected. Non-significant deficits were observed for cancers of the oral cavity and pharynx (RR = 0.6, n = 16), colon and rectum (RR = 0.8, n = 20), stomach (RR = 0.8, n = 36), and lung (RR = 0.9, n = 45). Excess risks for leukemia and esophageal cancer were seen among men but not among women. The RR for leukemia was higher for X-ray workers who began employment before 1970 than for those who started more recently and also for those who were young when employment began. The patterns of risk associated with duration of work, and with age and calendar time of initial employment, suggest that the excesses of leukemia and skin cancer, and, possibly, cancers of the breast and thyroid, were due to occupational exposure to X-rays. However, there was little evidence that radiation contributed to the increased occurrences of liver or esophageal cancers.","['Wang, J X', 'Inskip, P D', 'Boice, J D Jr', 'Li, B X', 'Zhang, J Y', 'Fraumeni, J F Jr']","['Wang JX', 'Inskip PD', 'Boice JD Jr', 'Li BX', 'Zhang JY', 'Fraumeni JF Jr']","['Institute of Radiation Medicine, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Tianjin.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,,IM,"['Adult', '*Allied Health Personnel', 'China', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', '*Hospital Departments', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Leukemia/*epidemiology', 'Leukemia, Radiation-Induced/*epidemiology', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/*epidemiology', 'Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced/*epidemiology', 'Occupational Diseases/epidemiology', '*Radiology Department, Hospital']",1990/05/15 00:00,2001/03/28 10:01,['1990/05/15 00:00'],"['1990/05/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1990/05/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Int J Cancer. 1990 May 15;45(5):889-95. doi: 10.1002/ijc.2910450519.,,['10.1002/ijc.2910450519 [doi]'],,,,,,,,

We show that the capacity of TNF alpha and LT to induce IL-6 mRNA accumulation increases as monocytic differentiation proceeds with TNF alpha being more potent than LT, suggesting that alternate pathways may be used by differentiating cells to control expression of IL-6. In contrast, in monocytes which constitutively synthesize IL-6 transcripts, TNF alpha and LT treatment had opposite effects on levels of IL-6 mRNA accumulation. In these cells TNF alpha enhanced steady state levels of IL-6 transcripts due to mRNA stabilization, whereas LT shortened IL-6 mRNA half-life, most likely due to induction of a RNA destabilizer since LT-mediated downregulation of levels of IL-6 mRNA in monocytes could be prevented by inhibition of protein synthesis. Neither TNF alpha nor LT altered IL-6 mRNA accumulation by interfering with preexisting transcription factors since both TNF alpha and LT required de novo protein synthesis to exert their effects.","['Brach, M A', 'Cicco, N A', 'Riedel, D', 'Hirano, T', 'Kishimoto, T', 'Mertelsmann, R H', 'Herrmann, F']","['Brach MA', 'Cicco NA', 'Riedel D', 'Hirano T', 'Kishimoto T', 'Mertelsmann RH', 'Herrmann F']","['Department of Internal Medicine I, University of Freiburg, FRG.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Retracted Publication']",England,FEBS Lett,FEBS letters,0155157,"['0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Lymphotoxin-alpha)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '98600C0908 (Cycloheximide)']",IM,"['Blotting, Northern', 'Cell Differentiation/physiology', 'Cell Line', 'Cycloheximide/pharmacology', 'Gene Expression Regulation/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-6/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Lymphotoxin-alpha/*pharmacology', 'Monocytes/drug effects/*metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Recombinant Proteins/pharmacology', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/*pharmacology']",1990/04/24 00:00,1990/04/24 00:01,['1990/04/24 00:00'],"['1990/04/24 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/04/24 00:01 [medline]', '1990/04/24 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,FEBS Lett. 1990 Apr 24;263(2):349-54. doi: 10.1016/0014-5793(90)81411-g.,,"['0014-5793(90)81411-G [pii]', '10.1016/0014-5793(90)81411-g [doi]']",,,,,,,['Mertelsmann R.

Its mechanism of action has not been defined. Incubation of 7.5 X 10(6)/ml HL-60 human myelomonocytic leukemia cells with between 10 and 50 microM SRI 62-834 brought about a concentration-dependent, biphasic rise in intracellular calcium, as measured by the calcium-sensitive fluorescent dye Quin-2 AM. Incubation with 30 microM SRI 62-834 elevated intracellular calcium from 110 to 415 nM after 10 min in a typical experiment; this concentration inhibited cell growth by greater than 90% (50% inhibition of growth was observed at 8 microM). The calcium channel blockers verapamil and prenylamine did not inhibit the SRI 62-834-induced elevation of intracellular calcium. Incubation of SRI 62-834 with K562 erythroblastic leukemia cells also brought about a rise in the intracellular calcium. The growth of K562 cells was less sensitive to SRI 62-834 (dose to produce 50% growth inhibition, 65 microM) compared to HL-60 cells, and significant intracellular calcium rises, which were monophasic, required greater than 40 microM SRI 62-834. At a concentration of SRI 62-834 which inhibited both HL-60 and K562 growth by 90% (30 and 140 microM, respectively) an equivalent rise in intracellular calcium was observed (circa 400 nM). Preincubation of HL-60 or K562 cells with 1 to 100 nM 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate for 10 min prior to the addition of SRI 62-834 inhibited the rise in intracellular calcium in a concentration-dependent manner.

The extent of differentiation induced by activin A depended on the cell density in the initial inoculum; the percentage of benzidine-positive cells markedly decreased at an increasing cell density. In contrast, the hexamethylene bisacetamide (HMBA)-induced differentiation was affected only to a little extent by the cell density. Furthermore, the effects of activin A and HMBA were different in sensitivity to the inhibition by dexamethasone; the HMBA-induced differentiation was reduced by about 90% in the presence of dexamethasone, whereas the activin A-induced differentiation was reduced by 40 to 50%. Activin A and HMBA induced the differentiation in a synergistic manner. Especially when the maximal response to activin A was suppressed at high cell density, the simultaneous presence of a suboptimal concentration of HMBA markedly recovered this suppression. This synergism seemed to be generated at the commitment process. Taken together, these results indicate that activin A and HMBA exert their actions, at least in part, through different pathways, and that these pathways interact with each other, resulting in synergistic induction of murine erythroleukemia cell differentiation. Clinical implications of these findings are discussed.","['Yamashita, T', 'Eto, Y', 'Shibai, H', 'Ogata, E']","['Yamashita T', 'Eto Y', 'Shibai H', 'Ogata E']","['Fourth Department of Internal Medicine, University of Tokyo School of Medicine, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Acetamides)', '104625-48-1 (Activins)', '57285-09-3 (Inhibins)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)', 'LA133J59VU (hexamethylene bisacetamide)']",IM,"['Acetamides/antagonists & inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Activins', 'Animals', 'Cell Count', 'Cell Differentiation/*drug effects', 'Dexamethasone/pharmacology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Synergism', 'Erythroid Precursor Cells/drug effects', 'Inhibins/antagonists & inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*pathology', 'Mice']",1990/06/01 00:00,1990/06/01 00:01,['1990/06/01 00:00'],"['1990/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 1990 Jun 1;50(11):3182-5.,,,,,,,,,,

In these studies polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used to detect low levels of HSP-70 mRNA present in control, unheated cells to investigate the possibility of predicting the intrinsic heat response in various leukemic cells. The expression of two human heat shock genes in control or heat-shocked cells was investigated. Synthetic primers and probes from the untranslated region of the two HSP-70 genes sequenced by Hunt and Morimoto (HSP-70A)(C. Hunt and R. I. Morimoto, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 82: 6455-6459, 1985) and Voellmy et al. (HSP-70B)(R. Voellmy et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

The PCR results were correlated with heat response and patterns of protein synthesis in these cells. Results indicate that, among leukemic cells, K562 was much more resistant to killing by heat shock than either KG-1 or HL-60 cells. All control cells, however, expressed the HSP-70B gene. Of the three leukemic cells tested, K562 was the most heat resistant and constitutively expressed the HSP-70A mRNA and the heat-inducible HSP-70 protein. KG-1 and HL-60 cells did not express this gene in unheated cells. All heat-shocked cells expressed the HSP-70A mRNA and the heat-inducible HSP-70 protein. However, there was no significant increase in the mRNA level of the HSP-70B in heat-shocked leukemic cells as measured by PCR or the S1-nuclease protection assay. Other cells including normal human bone marrow and normal and tumorous tissues of the colon and breast all expressed both genes in control cells. Normal breast tissue expressed less mRNA for HSP-70B gene than the tumor tissue obtained from the same patient. In all studies the amplified beta-actin mRNA expression was used as an internal standard. These studies indicate that HSP-70B gene is expressed in all control leukemic cells. The expression of this gene did not seem to correlate with intrinsic heat resistance. The HSP-70A expression correlated with intrinsic and transient heat resistance. These studies also indicate that both HSP-70 genes in humans may be expressed in a variety of unheated normal and tumorous tissues more so than previously reported.","['Mivechi, N F', 'Rossi, J J']","['Mivechi NF', 'Rossi JJ']","['Department of Radiation Research and Molecular Genetics, City of Hope National Medical Center, Duarte, California.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Heat-Shock Proteins)', '0 (Oligonucleotide Probes)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', 'EC 3.1.30.1 (Single-Strand Specific DNA and RNA Endonucleases)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Bone Marrow/physiology', 'Electrophoresis, Gel, Two-Dimensional', '*Gene Amplification', 'Gene Expression', 'Heat-Shock Proteins/*genetics', '*Hot Temperature', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Leukemia/genetics', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Neoplasms/genetics', 'Oligonucleotide Probes', '*Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Single-Strand Specific DNA and RNA Endonucleases/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1990/05/15 00:00,1990/05/15 00:01,['1990/05/15 00:00'],"['1990/05/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/05/15 00:01 [medline]', '1990/05/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 1990 May 15;50(10):2877-84.,['CA 33572/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,

Externally added catalase decreased the cytotoxic effects of CuPUPY by 50% indicating an involvement of hydrogen peroxide in toxicity. An increased oxygen uptake and glutathione oxidation by K562 cells in the presence of CuPUPY suggested that toxicity might be due to a copper-mediated redox-cycle. In fact addition of glutathione to a solution of CuPUPY resulted in glutathione oxidation, O2-consumption and H2O2-generation. CuPUPY proved to be less toxic to human lymphocytes than to K562 cells.

The metabolic fate of mAQDI was examined in cultured CHO cells (subline AA8) to identify the end products to be expected following oxidative metabolism of m-AMSA. [Acridinyl-G-3H]-m-AQDI was rapidly accumulated by AA8 cells in phosphate buffered saline with complete conversion in less than one minute to m-AMSA, macromolecular adducts and polar low molecular weight species, each of these three classes being formed in approximately equal amounts. Two of the polar products were chromatographically identical to those formed on reaction of m-AQDI with reduced glutathione. These were identified by 1H NMR spectroscopy as the 1,4-addition product 5'-(S-glutathionyl)-m-AMSA and the previously unreported isomeric 6'-(S-glutathionyl)-m-AMSA. These thiol adducts were also formed rapidly from m-AQDI in deproteinized cell lysates indicating a non-enzymatic process, although the possibility of enzymatic catalysis in intact cells has not been eliminated. The absence of such products in AA8 cells after treatment with m-AMSA places an upper limit of 1% per hour on the rate of its oxidative metabolism in these cells and suggests that generation of m-AQDI is unlikely to be responsible for the cytotoxicity of m-AMSA in cultured tumour cells.","['Robbie, M A', 'Palmer, B D', 'Denny, W A', 'Wilson, W R']","['Robbie MA', 'Palmer BD', 'Denny WA', 'Wilson WR']","['Department of Pathology, University of Auckland School of Medicine, Private Bag, Auckland, New Zealand.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Biochem Pharmacol,Biochemical pharmacology,0101032,"['00DPD30SOY (Amsacrine)', '87764-57-6', ""(N(1')-methanesulfonyl-N(4')-(9-acridinyl)-3'-methoxy-2',5'-cyclohexanediene-1',4"", ""'-diimine)"", 'GAN16C9B8O (Glutathione)']",IM,"['Amsacrine/*analogs & derivatives/*metabolism', 'Animals', 'Cell Line, Transformed', 'Cricetinae', 'Cricetulus', 'Glutathione', 'Oxidation-Reduction']",1990/05/01 00:00,1990/05/01 00:01,['1990/05/01 00:00'],"['1990/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Biochem Pharmacol. 1990 May 1;39(9):1411-21. doi: 10.1016/0006-2952(90)90422-h.,,"['0006-2952(90)90422-H [pii]', '10.1016/0006-2952(90)90422-h [doi]']",,,,,,,,

This case illustrates the difficulty in diagnosing leukemia cutis from examination of routine histologic sections and the importance of specialized marker studies in determining the cause of an atypical cellular infiltrate of the skin.

During induction treatment with L-asparaginase a rise of glutamic acid and a decrease of glutamine occurred. This finding correlated with slowing of the EEG. Treatment with vincristine was associated with a slight drop of sodium and chloride concentration in serum, but not in the cerebrospinal fluid. Central nervous system prophylaxis with cranial irradiation, and to a lesser degree with intravenous medium-dose methotrexate, gave rise to a further deterioration of the blood-brain barrier function as indicated by an increase in albumin, alpha 2-macroglobulin and LDH levels. During radiotherapy the concentration of several amino acids rose, probably due to a disturbance of active carrier mechanisms.

The hypersensitive sites are found at positions 6.1, 10.9, 14.7, and 18 kilobase pairs (kbp) 5' of the epsilon-globin gene. Recently functional assays of the LAR that tested determinants for all four hypersensitive sites showed that expression of the human beta-globin gene was increased to normal or near-normal levels in both transgenic mice and erythroid cells. We constructed retroviral vectors with a human beta-globin gene and the determinant for a single hypersensitive site and measured beta-globin gene expression after retroviral infection of murine erythroleukemia cells. Fragments for the hypersensitive sites at -18 or -10.9 kbp increased human beta-globin RNA levels respectively to 35% or 132% of the endogenous mouse beta maj-globin RNA level. In addition, greater expression was also observed for the neomycin phosphotransferase RNA, which was transcribed from the retroviral LTR, showing that the LAR fragments activated expression from a heterologous promoter. In the context of gene-transfer experiments ultimately aimed at gene therapy, our results show that LAR determinants lead to an increased level of human beta-globin RNA expression after retroviral transfer into erythroid cells. But inclusion of LAR determinants in retroviral vectors also entails the potential risk of activating the expression of nonglobin genes in erythroid cells.","['Novak, U', 'Harris, E A', 'Forrester, W', 'Groudine, M', 'Gelinas, R']","['Novak U', 'Harris EA', 'Forrester W', 'Groudine M', 'Gelinas R']","['Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA 98104.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['9004-22-2 (Globins)', 'EC 3.1.21.1 (Deoxyribonuclease I)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Deoxyribonuclease I', '*Gene Expression Regulation', '*Genes', 'Globins/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute', 'Mice', 'Multigene Family', 'Proviruses/genetics', 'Restriction Mapping', 'Retroviridae/genetics', 'Transcription, Genetic', '*Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/metabolism']",1990/05/01 00:00,1990/05/01 00:01,['1990/05/01 00:00'],"['1990/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1990 May;87(9):3386-90. doi: 10.1073/pnas.87.9.3386.,"['AM-31232/AM/NIADDK NIH HHS/United States', 'HL-36444/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL-37073/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",['10.1073/pnas.87.9.3386 [doi]'],,PMC53905,,,,,,

Within the AA-prone dog, a singular phase of progressive decline in blood levels of granulocytes and monocytes was noted along with a similar reduction in marrow progenitors committed to granulocyte/monocyte differentiation (CFU-GM). Measured radioresistance of the preAA CFU-GM in vitro, relative to control CFU-GM from nonirradiated animals, revealed only slightly increased resistance to gamma rays, but significantly increased resistance to fission neutrons. Within the MPD-prone dogs, four preclinical phases (i.e. suppression, partial recovery, accommodation, and preleukemic transition) preceding development of overt MPD were evidenced by the monitored change in blood granulocyte/monocyte counts and marrow progenitor levels. Analysis of radioresistance of preMPD CFU-GM revealed marked changes with time of exposure and, in turn, with preclinical phase transitions. Gamma ray resistance increased in the initial phases of exposure, with maximal levels occurring during the middle phase of exposure (accommodation, phase III) followed by a tailing off of resistance at later times. Resistance to fission neutrons by preMPD CFU-GM was observed as well, but somewhat later in the exposure course and at a much lower, more consistent level. These differential patterns of radioresistance expressed by marrow CFU-GM of chronically irradiated MPD-prone dogs to gamma rays and fission neutrons gave rise to preclinical phase-specific 'relative biological effectiveness' (RBE) values. From these observations, we conclude that: (i) CFU-GM of MPD-prone dogs acquire and maintain marked radioresistance to low linear energy transfer (LET) gamma rays, but only marginally elevated radioresistance to high-LET fission neutrons during the course of chronic gamma ray exposure; and (ii) CFU-GM of the AA-prone dog, in contrast, acquire little change in resistance to gamma rays, but, surprisingly, marked resistance to neutrons relative to progenitors from nonirradiated controls. These results support the concept that acquired radioresistance of vital granulocyte/monocyte lineage-committed hematopoietic progenitors is temporally, perhaps causally, linked to the processes mediating hematopoietic recovery and accommodation under chronic irradiation, and in turn to preclinical events of evolving MPD. In addition, the marked differential responses of progenitors to gamma and neutron irradiation in vitro might suggest differences in the nature of cellular lesions elicited by chronic gamma irradiation, in vivo.","['Seed, T M', 'Kaspar, L V']","['Seed TM', 'Kaspar LV']","['Biological and Medical Research Division, Argonne National Laboratory, Illinois 60439.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,,IM,"['Anemia, Aplastic/*etiology', 'Animals', 'Blood Cell Count', 'Cell Differentiation/radiation effects', 'Dogs', 'Female', 'Gamma Rays', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*radiation effects', 'Male', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/*etiology', 'Neutrons', '*Radiation Tolerance']",1990/01/01 00:00,1990/01/01 00:01,['1990/01/01 00:00'],"['1990/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 1990;14(4):299-307. doi: 10.1016/0145-2126(90)90156-4.,,['10.1016/0145-2126(90)90156-4 [doi]'],,,,,,,,['NASA: 90238301']

Within the flour mills, the workers who had ever worked in the maintenance department (OR = 8.1) or in the elevator department (OR = 2.8) were at particularly elevated risk of developing NHL, suggesting that exposures in these departments should receive further attention.","['Alavanja, M C', 'Blair, A', 'Masters, M N']","['Alavanja MC', 'Blair A', 'Masters MN']","['Division of Cancer Etiology, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, MD 20892.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Natl Cancer Inst,Journal of the National Cancer Institute,7503089,['0 (Pesticides)'],IM,"['Case-Control Studies', 'Cohort Studies', '*Edible Grain', '*Food-Processing Industry', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/chemically induced', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/chemically induced', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/*mortality', 'Occupational Diseases/*mortality', 'Pancreatic Neoplasms/chemically induced', 'Pesticides/adverse effects']",1990/05/16 00:00,1990/05/16 00:01,['1990/05/16 00:00'],"['1990/05/16 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/05/16 00:01 [medline]', '1990/05/16 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Natl Cancer Inst. 1990 May 16;82(10):840-8. doi: 10.1093/jnci/82.10.840.,,['10.1093/jnci/82.10.840 [doi]'],,,,,,,,

The utility of Peldri II was demonstrated in studies using leukocytes from the blood of healthy donors and patients with leukemia as well as from long-term lymphoblastoid cell lines. The application of the proposed Peldri II procedure was further documented in SEM studies in which the expression and distribution of the interleukin-2 receptor (IL-2R) on leukocyte surface membranes was imaged using colloidal gold-labeled antibodies (i.e., immunogold). When compared with current SEM preparation procedures using CPD, Peldri II is a useful alternative that is thought to offer several important advantages.","['Helinski, E H', 'Bootsma, G H', 'McGroarty, R J', 'Ovak, G M', 'De Harven, E', 'Pauly, J L']","['Helinski EH', 'Bootsma GH', 'McGroarty RJ', 'Ovak GM', 'De Harven E', 'Pauly JL']","['Department of Molecular Immunology, Roswell Park Memorial Institute, Buffalo, New York 14263.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Electron Microsc Tech,Journal of electron microscopy technique,8502171,['0 (Fluorocarbons)'],IM,"['Cell Line', '*Fluorocarbons', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Hairy Cell/*pathology', 'Leukocytes/*ultrastructure', 'Microscopy, Electron, Scanning/instrumentation/*methods']",1990/04/01 00:00,1990/04/01 00:01,['1990/04/01 00:00'],"['1990/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Electron Microsc Tech. 1990 Apr;14(4):298-306. doi: 10.1002/jemt.1060140403.,['CA-38842/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],['10.1002/jemt.1060140403 [doi]'],,,,,,,,

After completion of treatment, 12 of 13 patients had resolution of severe monocytopenia and five of nine had normal monocyte antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity. There was statistically significant depression of total lymphocytes, T cells, and B cells. Evaluation of T subsets showed a decrease in CD4+ cells. Immunoglobulin G (IgG) in sera were decreased from baseline, while IgM and IgA were unaffected. There was no significant effect on skin-test reactivity or large granular lymphocyte numbers. Lymphoblastic transformation was variably affected. Natural-killer (NK) cell function was improved or unchanged after dCF treatment. Reevaluation of seven patients at 21 to 119 weeks after receiving dCF demonstrated that recovery to normal T- and B-cell numbers and subsets does occur. Five solid tumor patients were given dCF at 4 mg/m2 intravenously at 1- to 2-week intervals for up to five courses. There was significant reduction in T cells, B cells, CD4+, and CD8+ cells with no statistically significant effect on the other immune parameters. We conclude that low doses of dCF can cause persistent immunosuppression though recovery may occur after the drug is stopped.

T cells derived from spleens of B6 mice (Thy-1.2) immune to FBL-3, a Friend virus-induced leukemia, were activated by in vitro stimulation with irradiated FBL-3 and expanded by culture for 14 days with low concentrations of IL-2. The resultant FBL-3-specific T cell lines were adoptively transferred into cyclophosphamide pretreated congenic hosts (B6/Thy-1.1), and restimulated every 14 days by an injection of irradiated FBL-3 plus a 7-day course of IL-2. Donor T cells residing in the host were identified and quantified by use of antibody to the Thy-1.2 allele. The results confirmed that stimulation with FBL-3 on the day of transfer (day 0) plus IL-2 on days 0 to 6 induced rapid growth of donor T cells to approximately an 11-fold increase in total donor T cell number recoverable from host ascites and spleen by day 7. However, prolonging the course of IL-2 administration to 35 days did not maintain the number or the specific cytolytic function of donor T cells. By contrast, intermittent restimulation with specific Ag plus IL-2 induced intermittent regrowth of donor T cells in vivo, maintained the number of donor T cells in vivo at greater than the number input for longer than 1 mo, and allowed detection of substantially augmented donor T cell-mediated specific antitumor function over that period of time.","['Chen, W', 'Reese, V A', 'Cheever, M A']","['Chen W', 'Reese VA', 'Cheever MA']","['Department of Medicine, University of Washington, Seattle 98195.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Interleukin-2)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/administration & dosage', 'Cell Division', 'Cell Survival', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Immunity, Cellular', 'Immunization Schedule', 'Immunization, Passive', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Interleukin-2/pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'T-Lymphocytes/*cytology/immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/cytology/immunology']",1990/05/15 00:00,1990/05/15 00:01,['1990/05/15 00:00'],"['1990/05/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/05/15 00:01 [medline]', '1990/05/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 1990 May 15;144(10):3659-66.,"['CA30558/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA43081/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,

We studied survival in 118 acute leukemia patients over the age of 64 seen at a university hospital from 1970 to 1987. Seventy percent had myeloid morphology. Median survival times were 106 days in those diagnosed in the 1970s and 71 days for those diagnosed in the 1980s. This was little changed from an earlier series from the same hospital extending back to the 1940s in which median survival was 69 days. Considering the two decades separately, age at diagnosis, sex, race, type of leukemia, and whether or not disease-specific treatment was applied had no significant effect on survival duration. Acute leukemia in the older patient demands difficult medical and ethical choices.

In the eight patients at risk of growth failure, the relative height decreased 0.5-2.5 SD units (median 1.0) during the follow-up period. Eight patients secreted subnormal amounts of GH as studied by measuring spontaneous pulsatile GH secretion overnight. The maximal nocturnal GH peak varied between 3.3 and 28.3 micrograms/l (median 9.3). The mean nocturnal GH concentration varied from 1.2 to 8.3 micrograms/l (median 2.3) and depended on the length of the follow-up period. We conclude that deficient GH secretion is one reason for poor growth after BMT. A good growth response to GH substitution would support the role of GH deficiency in the observed growth retardation after BMT.","['Hovi, L', 'Rajantie, J', 'Perkkio, M', 'Sainio, K', 'Sipila, I', 'Siimes, M A']","['Hovi L', 'Rajantie J', 'Perkkio M', 'Sainio K', 'Sipila I', 'Siimes MA']","[""Children's Hospital, University of Helsinki, Finland.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Bone Marrow Transplant,Bone marrow transplantation,8702459,['9002-72-6 (Growth Hormone)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/*adverse effects', 'Child', 'Female', 'Growth Disorders/*etiology', 'Growth Hormone/*deficiency/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/radiotherapy/surgery', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/radiotherapy/surgery']",1990/03/01 00:00,1990/03/01 00:01,['1990/03/01 00:00'],"['1990/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Bone Marrow Transplant. 1990 Mar;5(3):183-6.,,,,,,,,,,

Patients were grouped into six regions: United Kingdom, Nordic Group, Benelux, France, Central Europe and Southern Europe. There were significant differences between these regions with respect to patient population and outcome. The relative proportion of the three major disease categories, stage and subtype of the diseases, graft-versus-host disease prevention methods, donor recipient sex combinations, age of the patient, year of the transplant and the time intervals from diagnosis to transplant, from diagnosis to first complete remission for acute leukemia and the time from first complete remission to the transplant varied from region to region. The analysis of outcome parameters showed a significant difference in relapse incidence from region to region. This influence of region was confirmed in a multivariate analysis and was independent of the other factors known to affect outcome. Leukemia-free survival and transplant-related mortality were not different. The reasons for these differences could not be explained by the data in the registry. We conclude that regional factors must be considered when bone marrow transplant data are compared and we postulate that pretransplant factors probably affect outcome more than was previously realized.","['Gratwohl, A', 'Hermans, J', 'Barrett, A J', 'Ernst, P', 'Frassoni, F', 'Gahrton, G', 'Granena, A', 'Kolb, H J', 'Prentice, H G', 'Vernant, J P']","['Gratwohl A', 'Hermans J', 'Barrett AJ', 'Ernst P', 'Frassoni F', 'Gahrton G', 'Granena A', 'Kolb HJ', 'Prentice HG', 'Vernant JP', 'et al.']","['Department of Internal Medicine, University Hospital Basel, Switzerland.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",England,Bone Marrow Transplant,Bone marrow transplantation,8702459,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/mortality/*statistics & numerical data', 'Chi-Square Distribution', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Europe/epidemiology', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease/prevention & control', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/mortality/surgery', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/mortality/surgery', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/mortality/surgery', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Rate']",1990/03/01 00:00,1990/03/01 00:01,['1990/03/01 00:00'],"['1990/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Bone Marrow Transplant. 1990 Mar;5(3):159-65.,,,,,,,,,,

The cCLLa is a 69-Kd glycoprotein antigen expressed selectively by malignant B cells in human CLL, hairy cell leukemia (HCL), and prolymphocytic leukemia. Immunoreactive 125I-CLL2 (5 micrograms/mouse, specific activity 4.3 microCi/micrograms) was injected intravenously in mice bearing HCL-derived EH xenografts, and blood kinetics and biodistribution were ascertained up to 16 days postinjection. Radioimages were also obtained up to 72 hours after injecting 10 micrograms/mouse (specific activity 50.1 microCi/micrograms) of 125I-CLL2. Distinct 125I-CLL2 blood kinetics were observed in EH engrafted compared with tumor-free mice including: a longer 125I-CLL2 T 1/2 (153 hours v 72 hours), and a considerably greater blood clearance (173 mg/h v 54.7 mg/h) with biexponential rather than monoexponential configuration; and a greater volume of antibody distribution (31,483 mg v 5,729 mg). These data suggest more rapid tissue uptake by grafted tumours. Preferential 125I-CLL2 uptake by EH tumours relative to normal tissues was observed beginning 24 hours postinjection (mean ratio, 4.2) with average peak tumor 125I-CLL2 levels of 428.7 pg/mg. 125I-CLL2 uptake selectivity by EH tumor cells was also supported by: (1) negligible 125I-CLL2 uptake by cCLLa- Molt-4 xenografts (average 29.1 pg/mg 24 hours postinjection); (2) background uptake of cCLLa-irrelevant MoAb 131I-LEU1 by CD5- EH xenografts (average 31.4 pg/mg 48 hours postinjection); and (3) by scintigraphy.

However, concomitant rearrangements of Ig and TcR genes have been commonly reported in the most immature lymphoid malignancies, mainly in B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). To better characterize the nature of this lineage promiscuity, we have analyzed the configuration of the TcR delta locus in 75 B-precursor ALL. The large majority of cases (87%) displayed a rearrangement or deletion at the delta locus. Among the 57 nondeletional rearrangements, two patterns were predominant and both appeared to derive from partial joining: a V delta-(D)-D delta 3 (32/57) and a D delta 1/2-D delta 3 (11/57) type. A single V delta gene (V delta 2) appeared to be involved in the first type of rearrangement. These findings are at variance with T-ALL, where rearrangements 5' to V delta 2 are usually found. It remains to be elucidated whether this incomplete attempt of V delta 2 gene assembly is related to the neoplastic event or represents a physiologic predisposition occurring during early stages of the normal lymphocyte differentiation.","['Biondi, A', 'Francia di Celle, P', 'Rossi, V', 'Casorati, G', 'Matullo, G', 'Giudici, G', 'Foa, R', 'Migone, N']","['Biondi A', 'Francia di Celle P', 'Rossi V', 'Casorati G', 'Matullo G', 'Giudici G', 'Foa R', 'Migone N']","['Clinica Pediatrica Universita di Milano, Monza, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (DNA Probes)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Macromolecular Substances)']",IM,"['B-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Bone Marrow/immunology/pathology', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/genetics/*immunology', 'DNA Probes', 'DNA, Neoplasm/genetics/isolation & purification', '*Gene Rearrangement, T-Lymphocyte', 'Humans', 'Macromolecular Substances', 'Restriction Mapping', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology']",1990/05/01 00:00,1990/05/01 00:01,['1990/05/01 00:00'],"['1990/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 1990 May 1;75(9):1834-40.,,['S0006-4971(20)84360-2 [pii]'],,,,,,,,

On Southern blot of DNAs in early BC, a single rearranged fragment of immunoglobulin heavy chain (IgH) genes was detected, whereas IgH genes were in germline configuration in both initial chronic phase and late BC. A clone which had a rearranged IgH gene in early BC, was considered to have co-existed with a clone which had the germline IgH gene. Analysis for bcr genes confirmed that the chronic phase as well as early and late BC were of the same clonal origin. Phenotypic and immunogenotypic analyses, however, revealed that at least two secondary clones emerged from the primary clone.

In the context of HTLV-1 gene expression, the U5 element would repress expression of unspliced genomic RNA of HTLV-1, but not subgenomic RNA.","['Seiki, M', 'Hikikoshi, A', 'Yoshida, M']","['Seiki M', 'Hikikoshi A', 'Yoshida M']","['Department of Viral Oncology, Cancer Institute, Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Virology,Virology,0110674,"['0 (RNA, Viral)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', 'EC 2.3.1.28 (Chloramphenicol O-Acetyltransferase)']",IM,"['Cell Line', 'Chloramphenicol O-Acetyltransferase/biosynthesis', '*Enhancer Elements, Genetic', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Viral', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*genetics', 'Humans', 'RNA Splicing', 'RNA, Viral/*biosynthesis', 'Repetitive Sequences, Nucleic Acid', 'Trans-Activators/*genetics', 'Transcriptional Activation']",1990/05/01 00:00,1990/05/01 00:01,['1990/05/01 00:00'],"['1990/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Virology. 1990 May;176(1):81-6. doi: 10.1016/0042-6822(90)90232-g.,,['10.1016/0042-6822(90)90232-g [doi]'],,,,,,,,

Unlike Clostridium perfringens, C. septicum is relatively aerotolerant and thus appears to be more capable of initiating infection in the absence of obvious damage to tissues. Six cases illustrate the clinical setting and fulminant nature of spontaneous gangrene caused by C. septicum. A lesion in the colon such as carcinoma is often present and is presumed to serve as a portal of entry to the bloodstream. Diabetes and leukopenia are also common predisposing conditions; compromise of vital host responses may facilitate proliferation of those organisms that settle out in the tissues. Acute lymphoma or leukemia during a course of chemotherapy is accompanied by damage to bowel mucosa and granulocytopenia, thus predisposing to spontaneous clostridial gangrene. Infection progresses in a fulminating manner; the majority of patients die within 24 hours of onset. Characteristic symptoms and signs include excruciating pain (although a sense of heaviness may be the only early symptom), swelling of tissues, crepitance, and bulla formation. A hallmark of C. septicum infection is the absence of acute inflammatory cells in involved tissues or in bulla fluid. A series of laboratory investigations demonstrated that fluid obtained from a bulla adversely affected the viability, morphology, and function of polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs), which may explain the paucity of PMNs in involved tissues and may in part contribute to the fulminant progression observed in infection due to this organism.","['Stevens, D L', 'Musher, D M', 'Watson, D A', 'Eddy, H', 'Hamill, R J', 'Gyorkey, F', 'Rosen, H', 'Mader, J']","['Stevens DL', 'Musher DM', 'Watson DA', 'Eddy H', 'Hamill RJ', 'Gyorkey F', 'Rosen H', 'Mader J']","['Infectious Disease Sections, Veterans Administration Medical Centers, Boise, Idaho.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",United States,Rev Infect Dis,Reviews of infectious diseases,7905878,,IM,"['Adenocarcinoma/complications', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Cardiomyopathy, Alcoholic/complications', 'Clostridium/*isolation & purification', 'Colonic Neoplasms/complications', 'Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2/complications', 'Female', 'Gas Gangrene/*etiology/microbiology', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged']",1990/03/01 00:00,1990/03/01 00:01,['1990/03/01 00:00'],"['1990/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Rev Infect Dis. 1990 Mar-Apr;12(2):286-96. doi: 10.1093/clinids/12.2.286.,,['10.1093/clinids/12.2.286 [doi]'],,,,,,,,

Pharmacokinetic parameters (metabolic index, drug/metabolite ratio, half-life) of 7-OH-MTX and their relationship to the kinetics of methotrexate were analyzed. A great variability was observed in the extent and time-course of the metabolite formation. The concentration of the metabolite was higher than that of the parent compound at any examined time after the end of the 24 hours' infusion. The increase of 7-OH-MTX levels at the end of the methotrexate infusion was found to be proportionate to the increase of the dose of MTX. Males had significantly higher metabolite levels than did females (P less than 0.01) in the dose range of 0.5-8.0 g/m2. The age of the patients also significantly influenced the rate of the metabolite formation. The serial number of the treatment courses did not have effect on the metabolism of MTX.

One hundred four episodes of septicemia occurred in 84 patients, 33% with solid tumors and 67% with leukemia or lymphoma. Sixty were primary septicemias, with the remainder being secondary. Of the 118 isolates recovered, 42% were Gram-positive organisms, 45% Gram-negative organisms, and 13% were fungi. Coagulase-negative staphylococci and Escherichia coli were the most common Gram-positive and Gram-negative isolates, respectively. The effect of the type of malignancy, neutropenic status, and presence of a central venous access device (CVAD) on the isolate(s) recovered was studied. Coagulase-negative staphylococci were more commonly isolated from leukemia-lymphoma patients (26% vs. 3%, P less than .01), while Gram-negative isolates (63% vs. 36%, P = .01), specifically Klebsiella species (21% vs. 5%, P = .02), were more common in solid tumor patients. Staphylococcus aureus was isolated more frequently from non-neutropenic patients than from those with neutropenia (19% vs. 4%, P = .02). Gram-positive isolates were more commonly found in patients with a CVAD (51% vs. 29%, P = .03), in particular coagulase-negative staphylococci (29% vs. 2%, P less than .001).

Twenty-seven patients with childhood acute lymphoblastic leukaemia were treated for marrow relapse with high-dose chemotherapy with or without total body irradiation followed by bone marrow transplantation (BMT). Twenty patients received allogeneic marrow from partially or completely matched histocompatible donors. In this group, nine patients (45%) were free of disease with a median follow-up of 57 months (range, 22 to 126 months) after transplantation, four (20%) died from interstitial pneumonitis and seven (35%) died after a further relapse. Seven patients received autologous marrow collected while they were in remission. In this group, one patient died from infection and six died after a further relapse. We conclude that allogeneic BMT is more effective than autologous transplantation and results in long-term disease-free survival in a significant number of patients.

At the same time, butyrate greatly induced the expression at the mRNA level of the vimentin gene. The increase in the level of this RNA started at 6 h of treatment and reached the maximum at Hour 24. Such an increase was caused at least in part by a stimulation in the rate of gene transcription, as suggested by transcription assays in isolated nuclei. Experiments in the presence of cycloheximide suggested that vimentin induction is probably a direct response to the action of butyrate, not mediated by the prior induction of other gene products. Unlike the case of vimentin, the levels of other RNAs, namely beta-actin, ornithine decarboxylase, and c-myc, were not enhanced, but they decreased at different times of treatment with butyrate. Finally, we observed that butyrate induced also the differentiation of HL60 cells, another human myeloid cell type.

Adduct accumulation was observed in all seven cases, reaching levels up to 0.28 fmol/microgram of DNA (0.45 mumol/mol of guanine). In one individual, maximal levels of adduct were reached after 7 days of exposure, followed by a steady decline, whereas in all other individuals continuous accumulation was observed throughout the exposure period. In four individuals for which data were available for Day 11 (12 to 16 h after the final intake of procarbazine), decreased amounts of O6-methylguanine were observed relative to the last previous measurements. The accumulation of O6-methylguanine was linearly correlated (P less than 0.01) with the cumulative dose of procarbazine, with a slope of 0.011 fmol of O6-methylguanine/microgram of DNA per mg/kg of body weight or 2.68 x 10(-4) fmol of O6 methylguanine DNA per mg/m2. (Two h after the administration of single p.o. doses of 1 to 10 mg/kg of procarbazine to rats, O6-methylguanine formation in leukocyte DNA was just under half that in liver DNA and showed a linear relationship with dose with a slope of 0.017 fmol/microgram of DNA per mg/kg of body weight or 5.67 x 10(-4) fmol of O6-methylguanine/microgram of DNA per mg/m2. A negative correlation (P less than 0.05) between the rate of accumulation of O6-methylguanine in different individuals and lymphocyte O6-alkylguanine-DNA alkyltransferase (AGT) was observed, demonstrating a probable protective effect of AGT against the accumulation of O6-methylguanine during exposure to methylating agents. This observation supports the suggestion of a possible role of procarbazine-induced O6-methylguanine in the pathogenesis of acute nonlymphocytic leukemia appearing after treatment with chemotherapeutic protocols which include procarbazine, based on the finding of low lymphocyte AGT levels in patients with such therapy-related neoplastic disease (Sagher et al., Cancer Res., 48: 3084-3089, 1988).

Overall, 58 excess ANLL occurred per 100,000 women-years at risk for patients treated with chemotherapy. The cumulative incidence was 0.7% at 10 years. Risk remained high over all periods of observation up to 9 years after treatment. Among 7974 women treated only with surgery during 1973 and 1974, a period before the widespread use of adjuvant chemotherapy for breast cancer, ANLL was not significantly increased (observed = 7, expected = 5.1). A case-control study was then conducted in Connecticut to evaluate in more detail the risk associated with adjuvant chemotherapy in the general population. Among 20 cases (17 incident leukemias and 3 deaths due to preleukemia) and 60 matched controls, alkylating agents were linked to an 11.9-fold risk of ANLL and preleukemia (95% confidence interval = 2.6-55). Chemotherapy regimens including melphalan were related to a higher risk of leukemic conditions than those including cyclophosphamide. These data suggest that women in the general population treated with adjuvant chemotherapy for breast cancer are at an increased risk of leukemia, that the risk remains high among long-term survivors, and that risk differs by type of alkylating agent administered.","['Curtis, R E', 'Boice, J D Jr', 'Moloney, W C', 'Ries, L G', 'Flannery, J T']","['Curtis RE', 'Boice JD Jr', 'Moloney WC', 'Ries LG', 'Flannery JT']","['Radiation Epidemiology Branch, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland 20892.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],IM,"['Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*adverse effects', 'Breast Neoplasms/*drug therapy', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*chemically induced', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/chemically induced', 'Middle Aged', 'Preleukemia/chemically induced', 'Risk Factors']",1990/05/01 00:00,2001/03/28 10:01,['1990/05/01 00:00'],"['1990/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1990/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 1990 May 1;50(9):2741-6.,,,,,,,,,,

C. Erickson et al., Chromosoma, 74: 125-139, 1979). We utilized this technique to study, in HL-60 cells, the effects of 1-beta-D-arabinofuranosylcytosine (ara-C) on the formation of these replication intermediates and the kinetics of transit of radiolabel from [3H]thymidine ([3H]dThd) or [3H]-ara-C through these nDNA fragments and into full length nDNA. In the continuous presence of [3H]-ara-C (4 microM), the majority of radiolabel (greater than 85%) remained in the nascent subgenomic fractions, with 30-50% remaining in Okazaki fragments. These proportions did not change substantially with increasing time of exposure to [3H]-ara-C (from 1 to 24 h), although the total amount of [3H]-ara-C incorporated into DNA continued to increase with increasing time of exposure. In contrast, when cells were exposed to [3H]-ara-C for 1 h, placed in drug-free medium, and studied by the pH-step method at various times thereafter, the transit of radiolabel through progressively larger nDNA intermediates and into full length nDNA was rapid and equal to that of [3H]dThd in cells not exposed to drug. The observed elution of [3H]-ara-C in the subgenomic-length DNA fragments was not due to ara-C-induced breaks in template (parental) DNA and subsequent incorporation of [3H]-ara-C into the template strand, since ara-C treatment of cells prelabeled with [14C]dThd failed to cause substantial elution of the 14C label at the various pH steps used. In studies of the effects of ara-C on [3H]dThd incorporation into nDNA, concentrations of 1 to 10 microM ara-C inhibited total incorporation of radiolabel into DNA by greater than 90% and incorporation into full length nDNA by greater than 97%. In contrast, these concentrations of ara-C failed to decrease the amount of [3H]dThd incorporated into Okazaki fragments or other non-mitochondrial low molecular weight nDNA, compared to control. These studies demonstrate that, in HL-60 cells, ara-C causes profound inhibition of nascent chain elongation, does not cause chain termination, and does not inhibit initiation. In fact, ara-C may stimulate initiation, leading credence to recent theories proposing endoreduplication or reinitiation as consequences of ara-C incorporation into DNA.","['Ross, D D', 'Chen, S R', 'Cuddy, D P']","['Ross DD', 'Chen SR', 'Cuddy DP']","['Division of Developmental Therapeutics, University of Maryland Cancer Center, Baltimore 21201.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Arabinonucleotides)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', ""7075-11-8 (1-beta-D-arabinofuranosylcytosine 5'-monophosphate)"", 'F469818O25 (Cytidine Monophosphate)', 'VC2W18DGKR (Thymidine)']",IM,"['Arabinonucleotides/metabolism', 'Cytarabine/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Cytidine Monophosphate/analogs & derivatives/metabolism', 'DNA Replication/*drug effects', 'DNA, Neoplasm/biosynthesis', 'Humans', 'Hydrogen-Ion Concentration', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/metabolism', 'Thymidine/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1990/05/01 00:00,1990/05/01 00:01,['1990/05/01 00:00'],"['1990/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 1990 May 1;50(9):2658-66.,['R0-1-CA40188/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,

The chemotherapeutic characterization of sulfinosine that evolved from these studies suggests that this agent may have unique properties that deserve clinical consideration.

EN03 and EN04 moderately inhibited the transport and incorporation of the nucleosides in dose-dependent manners, while the mother compound EN01 had the least inhibitory effect. These findings indicated that alkylation at the indole nitrogen in combination with bromination at C-13 of the festuclavine molecule strengthened its inhibitory action on nucleoside uptake to a remarkable extent. The inhibition curves of nucleoside incorporation into TCA-insoluble materials showed quite similar dose-dependence to those of the inhibition curves for cellular nucleoside transport. These results suggest that the inhibitions of DNA and RNA syntheses by the festuclavine derivatives are due to the depressed transport of nucleosides into the leukemia cells.","['Hibasami, H', 'Nakashima, K', 'Pertz, H', 'Kasper, R', 'Eich, E']","['Hibasami H', 'Nakashima K', 'Pertz H', 'Kasper R', 'Eich E']","['Department of Biochemistry, Mie University School of Medicine, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Ireland,Cancer Lett,Cancer letters,7600053,"['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Ergolines)', '0 (Nucleosides)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', 'A8SW57GO7T (agroclavine)', 'VC2W18DGKR (Thymidine)', 'WHI7HQ7H85 (Uridine)']",IM,"['*Antibiotics, Antineoplastic', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Chemical Phenomena', 'Chemistry', 'DNA, Neoplasm/*biosynthesis', 'Depression, Chemical', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Ergolines/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*metabolism/pathology', 'Nucleosides/metabolism/*pharmacokinetics', 'RNA, Neoplasm/*biosynthesis', 'Thymidine/metabolism/pharmacokinetics', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects/metabolism/pathology', 'Uridine/metabolism/pharmacokinetics']",1990/04/20 00:00,1990/04/20 00:01,['1990/04/20 00:00'],"['1990/04/20 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/04/20 00:01 [medline]', '1990/04/20 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Lett. 1990 Apr 20;50(2):161-4. doi: 10.1016/0304-3835(90)90247-u.,,"['0304-3835(90)90247-U [pii]', '10.1016/0304-3835(90)90247-u [doi]']",,,,,,,,

The percentage of DNA cross-links (C) in these cells did not vary linearly with the concentration of melphalan, possibly as a result of DNA fragmentation during a 16 h lysis to degrade RNA. In order to investigate this, DNA was exposed to melphalan and then the Ct was determined immediately after maximal DNA cross-link formation or after a 16 h incubation. The additional incubation period did not alter the linear relationship between Ct and melphalan concentration. Further, the DNA cross-links produced by melphalan does not appear to be heat labile since varying the heat denaturation period from 5 to 15 min had no effect on Ct. These results suggest that this assay can accurately quantitate the percentage of DNA cross-links produced by melphalan and that the curvilinear relationship between Ct and melphalan concentration in malignant human lymphocytes is not due to the ethidium bromide fluorescence assay.","['Panasci, L', 'McQuillan, A', 'Cohen, J', 'Zackon, I']","['Panasci L', 'McQuillan A', 'Cohen J', 'Zackon I']","['Lady Davis Institute for Medical Research, Sir Mortimer B.

Fifty-four patients were in first chronic phase (CP) at time of transplantation, and 48 had evidence of more advanced disease (AD) (accelerated phase, 32; blast crisis, 9; second CP, 7). In 44 cases, the donor and recipient were identical at the HLA A, B, and DR loci and were nonreactive in bidirectional mixed leukocyte culture (MLC) (""matched""). In 58 cases, nonidentity between donor and recipient could be determined at at least one HLA locus or in bidirectional MLC (""mismatched""). Fifty-eight patients were prepared for transplantation with a combination of cyclophosphamide and fractionated total body irradiation (FTBI) and received acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis consisting of methotrexate alone or in combination with cyclosporine, prednisone, or antithymocyte globulin (ATG). In 44 cases, patients received preparative agents in addition to cyclophosphamide and FTBI, and marrow depleted of mature T lymphocytes by ex vivo incubation with either anti-CD3 antibody plus complement (n = 24) or Campath-1 (n = 20). Engraftment defined by a peripheral blood neutrophil count greater than 0.5 X 10(9)/L was demonstrated in 92 cases and occurred at a median of 22 days (range, 11 to 46 days). In 10 cases, peripheral blood evidence of engraftment did not occur, and in one case, engraftment was followed by aplasia. Hematologic relapse was seen in four cases. Recurrence or persistence of the Ph1 chromosome without evidence of hematologic relapse occurred in four additional cases. The incidence of grade II to IV acute GVHD is 65% (95% confidence interval [CI], +/- 10%). After adjustment for recipient age and donor matching status, recipients of T lymphocyte-depleted donor marrow had a significantly lower incidence of grade II to IV acute GVHD (P less than .01); however, T depletion was not significantly associated with improved survival (P = .34), disease-free survival (P = .51), or increased incidence of relapse (P = .39). Of 102 patients, 46 are alive, with a median survival of 12 months (range, 3 to 46 months), and the Kaplan-Meier estimate of disease-free survival is 29% (95% CI, +/- 9%) for the entire group at 2 1/2 years.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)","['McGlave, P B', 'Beatty, P', 'Ash, R', 'Hows, J M']","['McGlave PB', 'Beatty P', 'Ash R', 'Hows JM']","['University of Minnesota Medical School, Minneapolis.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Cyclosporins)', '0 (Drug Combinations)', 'VB0R961HZT (Prednisone)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation/adverse effects', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cyclosporins/therapeutic use', 'Drug Combinations', 'Graft Rejection', 'Graft vs Host Disease/epidemiology/prevention & control', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/epidemiology/mortality/*surgery', 'Methotrexate/therapeutic use', 'Middle Aged', 'Prednisone/therapeutic use', 'Prognosis', 'Recurrence', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",1990/04/15 00:00,1990/04/15 00:01,['1990/04/15 00:00'],"['1990/04/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/04/15 00:01 [medline]', '1990/04/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 1990 Apr 15;75(8):1728-32.,"['CA 18029-14/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA21737-12/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",['S0006-4971(20)84397-3 [pii]'],,,,,['Blood 1990 Aug 1;76(3):654'],,,

Children have been reported to have a low incidence of severe toxicity and significant rates of failure to achieve full engraftment. We evaluated the disposition of busulfan in children between 2 months and 3.6 years of age with lysosomal storage diseases, leukemia, and immunodeficiency disorders receiving oral doses of 1 or 2 mg/kg using a gas chromatographic assay. Peak concentrations were lower than those previously reported for adults, ranging from 1.4 to 5.2 mumol/L. The harmonic mean of the elimination half-life was 92 minutes, which is only slightly faster than that for adults (140 minutes). However, the area under the curve ranged from 400 to 1,000 (715 +/- 240) mumol.min/L, substantially lower than in adults receiving 1 mg/kg (range, 710 to 5,100 mumol.min/L; mean +/- SD, 2,180 +/- 1,200). The apparent volume of distribution (assuming complete bioavailability) ranged from 0.28 to 3.53 L/kg (1.42 +/- 0.86), which is more than twice that reported for adults (0.60 +/- 0.42). Busulfan clearance rate normalized to surface area is twice as high in children (200 +/- 100 mL/min/m2) as it is in adults (95 +/- 54 mL/min/m2). Alterations in bioavailability (absorption or first pass elimination) or in actual volume of distribution may account for these differences in drug disposition. The observed differences suggest the need for separate phase I dose escalation studies in children with accompanying pharmacokinetic assessment.","['Grochow, L B', 'Krivit, W', 'Whitley, C B', 'Blazar, B']","['Grochow LB', 'Krivit W', 'Whitley CB', 'Blazar B']","['Division of Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics, Johns Hopkins Oncology Center, Baltimore, MD 21205.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,['G1LN9045DK (Busulfan)'],IM,"['Administration, Oral', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/adverse effects', 'Busulfan/administration & dosage/*pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use', 'Child, Preschool', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Graft Rejection/drug effects', 'Graft vs Host Disease/prevention & control', 'Humans', 'Infant']",1990/04/15 00:00,1990/04/15 00:01,['1990/04/15 00:00'],"['1990/04/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/04/15 00:01 [medline]', '1990/04/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 1990 Apr 15;75(8):1723-7.,"['AM 1509 (BRB)/AM/NIADDK NIH HHS/United States', 'P01-CA-21737/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01-CA15396/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",['S0006-4971(20)84396-1 [pii]'],,,,,,,,

Additional numerical chromosomal changes were a trisomy 8 or 17 in two cases each and a trisomy 19 in one case. Five patients had myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) diagnosed according to the FAB nomenclature as chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) in two cases, refractory anemia with excess of blasts in transformation (RAEBt) in two cases, and refractory anemia with excess of blasts (RAEB) in one case. One patient suffered from a myeloproliferative disorder (MPS). All cases progressed to acute nonlymphocytic leukemia (ANLL) type M1, M2, or M4 in a period of 2 to 30 months after initial diagnosis, except one patient with RAEBt who died within 2 months. Two patients presented with ANLL-M2 at time of diagnosis. Treatment during the chronic phase of disease consisted of mild cytoreduction and/or substitution of platelets or red blood cells. One patient with CMML received an allogeneic bone marrow graft and relapsed after 33 months with ANLL-M1. Treatment results for overt leukemia were poor, and survival was short, lasting from 1 to 4 months. Overall survival was 1 to 37 months (median duration, 6.5 months). Molecular studies in two cases revealed neither a BCR rearrangement nor a translocation of the ABL protooncogene, as observed in Ph1-positive chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). Thus, an i(17q) anomaly seems to identify a distinct subgroup of mostly myelodysplastic and, less frequently, myeloproliferative disorders that progress rapidly to ANLL, respond poorly to chemotherapy, and are associated with short survival after transformation.","['Becher, R', 'Carbonell, F', 'Bartram, C R']","['Becher R', 'Carbonell F', 'Bartram CR']","['Innere Universitats-und Poliklinik (Westdeutsches Tumorzentrum), Essen, FRG.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Blotting, Southern', 'Chromosome Aberrations/*genetics', 'Chromosome Disorders', 'Chromosome Mapping', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 17/*ultrastructure', 'Female', 'Hematologic Diseases/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Chronic, Atypical, BCR-ABL Negative/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged']",1990/04/15 00:00,1990/04/15 00:01,['1990/04/15 00:00'],"['1990/04/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/04/15 00:01 [medline]', '1990/04/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 1990 Apr 15;75(8):1679-83.,,['S0006-4971(20)84389-4 [pii]'],,,,,,['Blood. 1990 Nov 1;76(9):1893-4.

The median age of patients was 30 years (range, 1 to 65). The median interval between achieving CR and autografting was 5 months (range, 1 to 23). Of the 263 patients, 131 patients received cytoreductive regimens that included total body irradiation (TBI); the remainder received various combinations of cytotoxic drugs. Sixty-nine patients received autologous marrow purged in vitro with mafosfamide, and 194 received unpurged marrow. The median follow-up was 28 months (range, 12 to 97). For patients with standard risk AML in CR1 autografted after TBI (n = 107), the leukemia-free survival (LFS) was higher, and the probability of relapse was lower in recipients of purged than of unpurged marrow (63% versus 34%, P = .05 and 23% versus 55%, relative risk 0.34, P = .005, respectively). The superior results of purging were most obvious in patients autografted within 6 months of achieving CR (probability of relapse, 20% versus 61%, P = .01). Patients with longer intervals between CR and autografting had higher LFS and lower probability of relapse than those autografted early in CR (intervals greater than 9 months, 7 to 9 months, 4 to 7 months, and less than or equal to 3 months: LFS = 56%, 40%, 35%, 27%, P = .007, probability of relapse = 25%, 56%, 59%, 67%, P = .005; respectively).

The effects of saponin treatment on R1 cells and neuraminidase on human red blood cells were also studied. It is shown that the dielectrophoretic behaviour can be interpreted in terms of cell surface charge and cell membrane conductivity effects. HMBA reduces the cell surface charge on all three cell lines, and in lines DS19 and DR10, where the cells are induced to differentiate, there is an increase in effective cell conductivity.

Immunohistochemical staining revealed that macrophage-like cells contained a much higher amount of dThdPase than parenchymal cells in the liver and lung. dThdPase was found to be highly expressed in T- and B-cell-type malignant lymphoma cells, but low in lymphoblastic and myeloblastic leukemia cells. We also found that carcinomas in the stomach, colon and ovary contained higher amounts of this enzyme than non-neoplastic regions of the tissues.

PGA1 pretreatment of FLC in vitro for 5 days before inoculation into syngeneic mice slightly delayed tumour appearance, but did not significantly alter the pattern of tumour growth or mice survival, indicating that PGA1, at least in the conditions studied, did not affect FLC tumorigenicity. Daily treatment of mice with a long-acting synthetic analogue of PGA2 (16, 16 dimethyl-PGA2-methyl ester, di-M-PGA2) delayed tumour appearance, inhibited tumour growth, as measured by tumour weight and diameter, and increased the median mice survival time by 15-35%, depending on the schedule of treatment. Daily treatment with di-M-PGA2 strongly suppressed NK activity in normal mice but had no significant effect in tumour-bearing immunodepressed mice. PGA treatment of effector or target cells in vitro, or PGA added during the NK assay, had no effect on NK activity.

This enhancement does not appear to be related to differences in the repair of 5FU-induced DNA damage. It is proposed that the inhibition of DNA synthesis by NMF (that is reversible and does not result in any detectable toxicity) becomes a lethal event in a cell in which DNA synthesis has already been altered by 5FU exposure. The synergism is sequence dependent (i.e. it does not occur when NMF is given before 5FU) and specific for some cell types as shown by the fact that no synergism was found in L1210 mouse leukaemia cells. In nude mice transplanted s.c. with HT29 cells daily 5FU treatment (for 5 days) followed by daily NMF treatment (for 10 days) caused much greater inhibition of tumour growth than either drug alone or the same combination given in the opposite order (NMF then 5FU). These results, if confirmed on other human colon tumours, could be of clinical interest as a means of increasing the therapeutic efficacy of 5FU in patients with colon cancer.","['Laudonio, N', 'Zupi, G', 'Erba, E', 'Leonetti, C', ""D'Incalci, M""]","['Laudonio N', 'Zupi G', 'Erba E', 'Leonetti C', ""D'Incalci M""]","['Instituto di Ricerche Farmacologiche Mario Negri, Milan, Italy.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Br J Cancer,British journal of cancer,0370635,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Formamides)', 'U3P01618RT (Fluorouracil)', 'XPE4G7Y986 (methylformamide)']",IM,"['Adenocarcinoma/*drug therapy', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Cell Line', 'Colonic Neoplasms/*drug therapy', 'DNA Damage', 'DNA, Neoplasm/drug effects', 'Drug Synergism', 'Fluorouracil/administration & dosage', 'Formamides/administration & dosage', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Nude', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects']",1990/03/01 00:00,1990/03/01 00:01,['1990/03/01 00:00'],"['1990/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Br J Cancer. 1990 Mar;61(3):377-81. doi: 10.1038/bjc.1990.82.,,['10.1038/bjc.1990.82 [doi]'],,PMC1971307,,,,,,

This was performed by treating rats with aminoguanidine [an inhibitor of Cu-dependent amine oxidase (CuAO)], NN'-bis(buta-2,3-dienyl)butane-1,4-diamine [MDL 72527, an inhibitor of FAD-dependent polyamine oxidase (PAO)], tetrachloromethane (hepatotoxic agent) and combinations of these compounds. Emphasis was laid on the origin and possible clinical usefulness of two polyamine metabolites: acetylisoputreanine-gamma-lactam and N1N12-diacetylspermine. Acetylisoputreanine-gamma-lactam is a normal constituent of human and rat urine. Treatment of rats with aminoguanidine led to undetectable urinary levels of acetylisoputreanine-gamma-lactam, whereas MDL 72527 treatment resulted in a 12-fold increase. Under normal conditions this compound represents a minor CuAO catabolite of N1-acetylspermidine, but may become of more importance under CuAO-induced conditions. N1N12-diacetylspermine was undetectable in urine samples from non-pregnant adults and rats, but became detectable after treating rats with MDL 72527. Additional tetrachloromethane poisoning resulted in a 35-fold increase of N1N12-diacetylspermine in urine and its appearance in liver. Hence urinary excretion of N1N12-diacetylspermine during PAO inhibition may serve as a sensitive marker for cell death. This was confirmed by myeloid-leukaemia-bearing rats treated with MDL 72527, which also excreted N1N12-diacetylspermine in urine in relatively high amounts from at least day 14 until spontaneous death.","['Hessels, J', 'Ferwerda, H', 'Kingma, A W', 'Muskiet, F A']","['Hessels J', 'Ferwerda H', 'Kingma AW', 'Muskiet FA']","['Central Laboratory for Clinical Chemistry, University Hospital Groningen, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Biochem J,The Biochemical journal,2984726R,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Polyamines)', '1YVR349GN4 (MDL 72527)', 'CL2T97X0V0 (Carbon Tetrachloride)', 'EC 1.5.- (Oxidoreductases Acting on CH-NH Group Donors)', 'EC 1.5.3.- (polyamine oxidase)', 'V10TVZ52E4 (Putrescine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Biomarkers, Tumor', 'Carbon Tetrachloride/pharmacology', 'Cell Survival', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*diagnosis/drug therapy', 'Liver/analysis', 'Oxidoreductases Acting on CH-NH Group Donors/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Polyamines/*urine', 'Putrescine/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Rats', 'Rats, Inbred Strains']",1990/03/15 00:00,1990/03/15 00:01,['1990/03/15 00:00'],"['1990/03/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/03/15 00:01 [medline]', '1990/03/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Biochem J. 1990 Mar 15;266(3):843-51.,,,,PMC1131216,,,,,,

Excess mortality from leukemia (SMR = 503, n = 3) and multiple myeloma (SMR = 989, n = 2) was observed among fire fighters with 30 years or more fire combat duty. Lung cancer mortality was elevated (SMR = 177, n = 18) among fire fighters 65 years old or older. We also analyzed the data by considering fire fighters at risk only after 30 years from first exposure. In this analysis, a trend of increasing risk with increasing exposure was observed for diseases of the circulatory system. For this cause of death, fire fighters with 30 years or more fire combat duty had a relative risk of 1.84 compared to those with less than 15 years of fire combat duty.","['Heyer, N', 'Weiss, N S', 'Demers, P', 'Rosenstock, L']","['Heyer N', 'Weiss NS', 'Demers P', 'Rosenstock L']","['Department of Environmental Health, School of Public Health and Community Medicine, University of Washington, Seattle 98195.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Am J Ind Med,American journal of industrial medicine,8101110,['0 (Smoke)'],IM,"['*Cause of Death', 'Cohort Studies', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Fires/*prevention & control', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Gastrointestinal Diseases/mortality', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Leukemia/mortality', 'Neoplasms/mortality', 'Occupational Diseases/chemically induced/*mortality', 'Respiratory Tract Diseases/mortality', 'Risk Factors', 'Smoke/*adverse effects', 'Washington/epidemiology']",1990/01/01 00:00,1990/01/01 00:01,['1990/01/01 00:00'],"['1990/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Am J Ind Med. 1990;17(4):493-504. doi: 10.1002/ajim.4700170407.,,['10.1002/ajim.4700170407 [doi]'],,,,,,,,
