The serum levels of sVCAM-1 reflected tumour burden as expressed by Binet/Rai stages more closely than any other marker. sVCAM-1 also reflected the kinetics of the disease as revealed by lymphocyte doubling time. sVCAM-1 was the only one of the studied markers which showed elevated levels in smouldering disease compared to controls. sVCAM-1, sICAM-1 and sCD23 (but not LDH, TK, beta2m) separated smouldering from non-smouldering B-CLL. Only sICAM-1, sCD23 and TK added independent prognostic information for survival to that of stage and lymphocyte doubling time. The expression of both adhesion molecules was examined in lymph node and splenic specimens. VCAM-1 and ICAM-1 were overexpressed by vascular endothelium and stroma, but the intensity of expression correlated poorly with serum levels of the soluble molecules. In conclusion, serum levels of sVCAM-1 correlated with tumour burden and other prognostic markers in B-CLL. VCAM-1 was overexpressed in tumour tissue as was ICAM-1. sVCAM-1 could prove a valuable marker in younger early-stage patients eligible for therapeutic trials.","['Christiansen, I', 'Sundstrom, C', 'Totterman, T H']","['Christiansen I', 'Sundstrom C', 'Totterman TH']","['Department of Clinical Immunology and Transfusion Medicine, University Hospital, Uppsala, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (CD3 Complex)', '0 (Vascular Cell Adhesion Molecule-1)', '126547-89-5 (Intercellular Adhesion Molecule-1)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Anemia, Refractory, with Excess of Blasts/blood', 'CD3 Complex/metabolism', 'Cell Division', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Intercellular Adhesion Molecule-1/blood', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*blood/pathology', 'Lymphocyte Count', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', 'T-Lymphocytes/metabolism', 'Vascular Cell Adhesion Molecule-1/*blood']",1999/01/14 00:00,1999/01/14 00:01,['1999/01/14 00:00'],"['1999/01/14 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/01/14 00:01 [medline]', '1999/01/14 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1046/j.1365-2141.1998.01110.x [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 1998 Dec;103(4):1129-37. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2141.1998.01110.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the vast majority of CML cases the breakpoint on chromosome 22 falls in the so-called major breakpoint cluster region of the BCR gene. Only a few cases of CML with breakpoint in the minor or in the micro bcr region have so far been reported. The micro breakpoint position has been associated mainly with a mild form of CML, defined as Philadelphia chromosome-positive chronic neutrophilic leukaemia (Ph-positive CNL). Using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) we report a patient with an acute myeloid leukaemia phenotype at diagnosis who showed a BCR/ABL rearrangement with a breakpoint located in the micro bcr region (e19a2 junction). Cytogenetic analysis showed a progression of the malignant clone, finally leading to cells with two Ph chromosomes, trisomy 8, isochromosome 17q and deletion of the long arms of chromosome 7. The findings of chromosomal changes point to a possibility of blast crisis of CML with a clinically silent chronic phase. Immunoprecipitation and auto-phosphorylation assay revealed the expression, by the patient's blast cells, of an abnormal P230 BCR/ABL protein, which showed for the first time that this protein was constitutively activated in primary cells from patients. This finding may contribute to the understanding of the role of the BCR/ABL rearrangements in determining different leukaemia phenotypes ranging from acute lymphoid and myeloid leukaemias to mild chronic neutrophilic leukaemias.","['Haskovec, C', 'Ponzetto, C', 'Polak, J', 'Maritano, D', 'Zemanova, Z', 'Serra, A', 'Michalova, K', 'Klamova, H', 'Cermak, J', 'Saglio, G']","['Haskovec C', 'Ponzetto C', 'Polak J', 'Maritano D', 'Zemanova Z', 'Serra A', 'Michalova K', 'Klamova H', 'Cermak J', 'Saglio G']","['Institute of Haematology and Blood Transfusion, Prague, Czech Republic.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*genetics', 'Gene Rearrangement/*genetics', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction/methods']",1999/01/14 00:00,1999/01/14 00:01,['1999/01/14 00:00'],"['1999/01/14 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/01/14 00:01 [medline]', '1999/01/14 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1046/j.1365-2141.1998.01098.x [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 1998 Dec;103(4):1104-8. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2141.1998.01098.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Median CDD activity in previously untreated AML was significantly lower than in RF-AML blasts (P=0.015) and was significantly lower in patients with complete remission than with blast persistence following induction chemotherapy (P=0.043). Structural investigation of the CDD gene by Southern analyses and RT-PCR showed no detectable aberrations. Sequence analysis of the CDD cDNA from nine RF-AML patients showed inconsistent aberrations in three patients. Semiquantitative assessment of CDD mRNA expression revealed a significant correlation with CDD activity. In conclusion, concordant with another recent study our data suggest a correlation of pretherapeutic CDD activity with induction treatment response. Besides the previously described prognostic impact of mdrl expression, this result could be useful for the development of risk-adapted AML treatment strategies and warrants further studies of CDD activity in well-defined cohorts of AML patients and of the mechanisms involved in the regulation of CDD activity.","['Schroder, J K', 'Kirch, C', 'Seeber, S', 'Schutte, J']","['Schroder JK', 'Kirch C', 'Seeber S', 'Schutte J']","['Department of Internal Medicine, University of Essen Medical School, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', 'EC 3.5.4.5 (Cytidine Deaminase)', 'ZRP63D75JW (Idarubicin)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/therapeutic use', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/therapeutic use', 'Blotting, Southern', 'Cytarabine/therapeutic use', 'Cytidine Deaminase/*genetics', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Humans', 'Idarubicin/therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/enzymology/*genetics', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation/genetics', 'Polymorphism, Genetic', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction/methods']",1999/01/14 00:00,1999/01/14 00:01,['1999/01/14 00:00'],"['1999/01/14 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/01/14 00:01 [medline]', '1999/01/14 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1046/j.1365-2141.1998.01084.x [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 1998 Dec;103(4):1096-103. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2141.1998.01084.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In 1995 a Dyskeratosis Congenita Registry was established at the Hammersmith Hospital. In the 46 families recruited, 76/83 patients were male, suggesting that the major form of DC is X-linked. As well as a variety of noncutaneous abnormalities, the majority (93%) of patients had bone marrow (BM) failure and this was the principal cause (71%) of early mortality. In addition to BM hypoplasia, some patients also developed myelodysplasia and acute myelod leukaemia. Pulmonary abnormalities were present in 19% of patients. In affected females the phenotype was less severe. Some female carriers of X-linked DC had clinical features. Carriers of X-linked DC showed skewed X-chromosome inactivation patterns (XCIPs), suggesting that cells expressing the normal DC allele have a growth/survival advantage over cells that express the mutant allele. Linkage analysis in multiplex families confirmed that the DKC1 gene, responsible for the X-linked form of DC, is located within Xq28 and facilitated its positional cloning. The high incidence of BM failure in association with a wide range of somatic abnormalities together with the ubiquitous expression of DKC1 suggest that, as well as having a critical role in normal haemopoiesis, this gene has a key role in normal cell biology.","['Knight, S', 'Vulliamy, T', 'Copplestone, A', 'Gluckman, E', 'Mason, P', 'Dokal, I']","['Knight S', 'Vulliamy T', 'Copplestone A', 'Gluckman E', 'Mason P', 'Dokal I']","['Department of Haematology, Imperial College School of Medicine, London, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Cause of Death', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Dyskeratosis Congenita/*genetics', 'Female', 'Genetic Linkage', 'Hematologic Diseases/genetics', 'Heterozygote', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Lung Diseases/genetics', 'Male', 'Pedigree', 'Phenotype', 'Registries', 'Sex Factors', 'X Chromosome/genetics']",1999/01/14 00:00,1999/01/14 00:01,['1999/01/14 00:00'],"['1999/01/14 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/01/14 00:01 [medline]', '1999/01/14 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1046/j.1365-2141.1998.01103.x [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 1998 Dec;103(4):990-6. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2141.1998.01103.x.,['Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom'],['Br J Haematol. 1999 May;105(2):571.

Flk-1/KDR-deficient murine embryos manifest failure of blood-island formation and vasculogenesis. The aim of this study was to directly evaluate the importance of VEGF, PlGF/Flt-1 and Flk-1/KDR receptor ligand interactions in regulating normal and malignant human haemopoiesis. Addition of VEGF and PlGF failed to enhance survival or cloning efficiency of human haemopoietic progenitors isolated from adult bone marrows, fetal livers or cord blood samples. This finding may be explained by the apparent absence of mRNA encoding Flt-1 and Flk-1/KDR receptors on stem cell rich CD34+ c-kit-R+ Rh123(low) cells. Further studies revealed that Fit-1 R mRNA, but not Flk-1/KDR mRNA was first detectable in the more mature cells isolated from haemopoietic colonies. Accordingly, VEGF receptors are either absent, or expressed at very low level, on human haemopoietic stem/progenitor cells. Of interest, normal and malignant human haemopoietic cells appeared to secrete VEGF protein. However, in contrast to normal haemopoietic progenitors, VEGF co-stimulated HEL cell proliferation as well as CFU-GM colony formation from approximately 15% of the chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) and acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) patients studied. Therefore, although VEGF appeared to have minimal effects on normal haemopoietic cell growth it would appear to drive malignant haemopoietic cell proliferation to some degree. Of more importance, however, we speculate that VEGF may play an very important role in leukaemogenesis by stimulating growth of vascular endothelium, thereby providing a sufficient blood supply to feed the growing haematological tumour.","['Ratajczak, M Z', 'Ratajczak, J', 'Machalinski, B', 'Majka, M', 'Marlicz, W', 'Carter, A', 'Pietrzkowski, Z', 'Gewirtz, A M']","['Ratajczak MZ', 'Ratajczak J', 'Machalinski B', 'Majka M', 'Marlicz W', 'Carter A', 'Pietrzkowski Z', 'Gewirtz AM']","['Department of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine, Philadelphia 19104, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (Endothelial Growth Factors)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (PGF protein, human)', '0 (Pregnancy Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A)', '0 (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factors)', '144589-93-5 (Placenta Growth Factor)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Receptor-1)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Cell Division', 'Cell Survival', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chronic Disease', 'Endothelial Growth Factors/*physiology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*cytology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/pathology', 'Lymphokines/*physiology', 'Placenta Growth Factor', 'Pregnancy Proteins/*physiology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Receptor-1', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factors']",1999/01/14 00:00,1999/01/14 00:01,['1999/01/14 00:00'],"['1999/01/14 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/01/14 00:01 [medline]', '1999/01/14 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1046/j.1365-2141.1998.01076.x [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 1998 Dec;103(4):969-79. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2141.1998.01076.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Using a combination of molecular biologic and biochemical methods, we analyzed cadherins expressed on cultured human malignant lymphoma cell lines (adult T cell lymphomas, human T cell leukemia virus type 1-negative T cell lines, and thymus-derived lymphoma cell lines), and obtained evidence that N-cadherin is the major cadherin expressed on these cells. These cells were found to form cell aggregates in a Ca2+-dependent manner, and more importantly to coaggregate and adhere with cells expressing N-cadherin, suggesting that N-cadherin on lymphoma cells is functionally active.

Protein kinase C (PKC) inhibition blocks lymphocyte adherence to and spreading on fibronectin. In contrast, putative PLC inhibitors yield distinct differences with respect to adhesion and morphology. The phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C (PLC) inhibitor neomycin blocked spreading of CD3/CD28-activated T cells on fibronectin by disrupting adhesion. Furthermore, when an additional inside-out signal for fibronectin adhesion is unnecessary such as with HPB-ALL T leukemic or phorbol-myristate-acetate-treated normal T cells, neomycin treatment does not alter adhesion or morphology. However, the phosphatidylcholine-specific PLC inhibitor D609 abrogates cell spreading without affecting adhesion to fibronectin in these cells as well as the CD3/CD28-activated T cells. These results strongly suggest that inside-out signaling for the integrin alpha4beta1 in lymphocytes proceeds through phosphatidylinositol-specific PLC and PKC, whereas the outside-in signal utilizes phosphatidylcholine-specific PLC and PKC.","['Wooten, D K', 'Teague, T K', 'McIntyre, B W']","['Wooten DK', 'Teague TK', 'McIntyre BW']","['Department of Immunology, The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston 77030, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Leukoc Biol,Journal of leukocyte biology,8405628,"['0 (Alkaloids)', '0 (Benzophenanthridines)', '0 (Bridged-Ring Compounds)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Fibronectins)', '0 (Integrins)', '0 (Norbornanes)', '0 (Phenanthridines)', '0 (Phosphodiesterase Inhibitors)', '0 (Protein Synthesis Inhibitors)', '0 (Thiocarbamates)', '0 (Thiones)', '5QC1Z07M77 (tricyclodecane-9-yl-xanthogenate)', 'E3B045W6X0 (chelerythrine)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'EC 3.1.4.- (Type C Phospholipases)', 'I16QD7X297 (Neomycin)']",IM,"['Alkaloids', 'Benzophenanthridines', 'Bridged-Ring Compounds/pharmacology', 'Cell Adhesion/drug effects/physiology', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Fibronectins/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Integrins/*physiology', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/pathology', 'Lymphocyte Activation/drug effects/physiology', 'Neomycin/pharmacology', 'Norbornanes', 'Phenanthridines/pharmacology', 'Phosphodiesterase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Protein Kinase C/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Protein Synthesis Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects/physiology', 'Substrate Specificity', 'T-Lymphocytes/cytology/enzymology/*physiology', 'Thiocarbamates', 'Thiones/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Type C Phospholipases/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism']",1999/01/14 00:00,1999/01/14 00:01,['1999/01/14 00:00'],"['1999/01/14 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/01/14 00:01 [medline]', '1999/01/14 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/jlb.65.1.127 [doi]'],ppublish,J Leukoc Biol. 1999 Jan;65(1):127-36. doi: 10.1002/jlb.65.1.127.,"['CA-09598/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-62596/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Investigators used Pearson product-moment correlation coefficients (r) to correlate age-adjusted incidence rates for selected cancers with the use data for selected pesticides. For most sex- and race/ethnicity-specific groups, the correlation coefficients were very close to zero or negative in sign, indicating no correlation between pesticide use and cancer incidence. There were, however, several exceptions, particularly in Hispanic males for whom the following correlations were observed: leukemia and atrazine (r=.40), leukemia and 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (r=.41), leukemia and captan (r=.46), atrazine and brain cancer (r=.54), and atrazine and testicular cancer (r=.41). For black males, we observed the following: atrazine and prostate cancer (r=.67) and Captan and prostate cancer (r=.49). In females, only a few of the correlations were elevated. Although most of the correlations examined in this analysis were not elevated, several of those in the Hispanic and black male populations were. These segments of the population have traditionally been employed as farm workers in California and have had the greatest potential for exposure to pesticides. This was an ecological study for which no data about exposure to pesticides at the individual level were available for analysis. In addition, no latency period was allowed between potential exposure and diagnosis with cancer. However, the results obtained in two minority groups who represented the majority of farm workers in the fields suggested that additional research studies, in which more rigorous study designs are used, should be conducted in those groups.","['Mills, P K']",['Mills PK'],"['Cancer Registry of Central California, Fresno 93710, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Arch Environ Health,Archives of environmental health,0212627,"['0 (Agrochemicals)', '0 (Pesticides)']",IM,"['Age Distribution', 'Agrochemicals/*adverse effects/analysis', 'California/epidemiology', 'Environmental Exposure/*adverse effects/analysis', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/*chemically induced/*epidemiology/ethnology', 'Occupations', 'Pesticides/*adverse effects/analysis', 'Population Surveillance', 'Racial Groups', 'Registries', 'Sex Distribution']",1999/01/14 00:00,1999/01/14 00:01,['1999/01/14 00:00'],"['1999/01/14 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/01/14 00:01 [medline]', '1999/01/14 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/00039899809605729 [doi]'],ppublish,Arch Environ Health. 1998 Nov-Dec;53(6):410-3. doi: 10.1080/00039899809605729.,['76.

Previous studies showed that a minimal deleted region (mdr) of approximately 6.5 cM is lost from one homologue in chromosome 2-deleted AMLs.

In this study, we refine the mdr to a I cM interval between markers D2Mit126 and D2Mit185 by microsatellite analysis of 21 primary radiation-induced F I AMLs. The construction of a partial yeast artificial chromosome (YAC) contig spanning the mdr and the location of six known genes indicated that the 1 cM mdr is homologous to human 11p11-12, a region implicated in some human AMLs. Screening of five cell lines derived from primary radiation-induced AMLs for homozygous loss of microsatellites and genes mapping within the mdr revealed loss of both copies of the hemopoietic tissue-specific transcription factor Sfpi1(PU.1/Spi1) in one cell line. Studies of primary and F1 AMLs failed to implicate Sfpi1 as the AML tumor suppressor gene. YAC contig construction, together with data suggesting that the critical gene flanks Sfpi1, represents significant progress toward identifying an AML tumor suppressor gene.","['Silver, A', 'Moody, J', 'Dunford, R', 'Clark, D', 'Ganz, S', 'Bulman, R', 'Bouffler, S', 'Finnon, P', 'Meijne, E', 'Huiskamp, R', 'Cox, R']","['Silver A', 'Moody J', 'Dunford R', 'Clark D', 'Ganz S', 'Bulman R', 'Bouffler S', 'Finnon P', 'Meijne E', 'Huiskamp R', 'Cox R']","['Radiation Effects Department, National Radiological Protection Board, Chilton, Oxfordshire, England. andy.silver@nrpb.org.uk']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Genes Chromosomes Cancer,"Genes, chromosomes & cancer",9007329,,IM,"['Animals', '*Chromosome Deletion', 'Chromosome Mapping/*methods', 'Chromosomes, Artificial, Yeast', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 11/*genetics', 'Contig Mapping', 'Crosses, Genetic', 'Genes, Tumor Suppressor/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Inbred CBA', 'Microsatellite Repeats/genetics', '*Sequence Homology, Nucleic Acid']",1999/01/14 03:01,2000/06/20 09:00,['1999/01/14 03:01'],"['1999/01/14 03:01 [pubmed]', '2000/06/20 09:00 [medline]', '1999/01/14 03:01 [entrez]']",['10.1002/(SICI)1098-2264(199902)24:2<95::AID-GCC1>3.0.CO;2-C [pii]'],ppublish,Genes Chromosomes Cancer. 1999 Feb;24(2):95-104.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS: 16 consecutive patients with acute respiratory failure complicating hematologic malignancies. INTERVENTIONS: NIV was delivered via nasal mask by means of a BiPAP ventilator (Respironics, USA); we evaluated the effects on blood gases, respiratory rate, and hemodynamics along with tolerance, complications, and outcome. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: 15 of the 16 patients showed a significant improvement in blood gases and respiratory rate within the first 24 h of treatment. Arterial oxygen tension (PaO2), PaO2/FIO2 (fractional inspired oxygen) ratio, and arterial oxygen saturation significantly improved after 1 h of treatment (43+/-10 vs 88+/-37 mmHg; 87+/-22 vs 175+/-64; 81+/-9 vs 95+/-4%, respectively) and continued to improve in the following 24 h (p < 0.01).

Induction therapy, which consisted of doxorubicin, vincristine, cyclophosphamide, L-asparaginase and prednisolone, was given in a response-oriented individualized fashion. Patients were randomly allocated either to receive or not, intrathecal chemotherapy on day 8 of the induction therapy. Complete remission (CR) was obtained in 97 (83.6%) patients (90.2%) in patients of less than 50 years of age and 67.6% in patients 50 years of age or older). At a median follow-up period of 65 months, the predicted 6-year overall survival and event free survival (EFS) rates of 116 patients were 23.4 and 20.0%, respectively. Predicted 6-year survival and disease-free survival (DFS) rates of 97 CR patients were 28.2 and 24.5%, respectively. By multivariate analysis, patients under 40 years of age (P = 0.002) or those with a platelet count of more than 100,000/microliters (P = 0.004) were significant favorable prognostic factors for obtaining CR, and days to CR less than 50 (P = 0.003), patients under 50 years of age (P = 0.005) were significant favorable factors for longer DFS. There was no significant difference in CR rates and DFS between the two randomized groups according to the intrathecal chemotherapy on day 8. Response-oriented induction therapy produced a high CR rate, but fairly intensive consolidation and maintenance/intensification chemotherapies resulted in only a marginal effect on DFS in adult ALL.

The results of the immunoprecipitation studies showed tyrosine phosphorylation of signal transducers and activators of transcription (Stat) 5 induced by G-CSF, GM-CSF, IL-3 and/or TPO in six cases, that of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) by GM-CSF in two cases and that of p38 by TNF in three cases. Intracellular amount of Stat5 was markedly increased in AML cells compared with that in CML cells and normal human bone marrow cells. whereas intracellular amount of ERK and p38 was uniformly abundant in both leukemic and normal cells. These results show cytokine-specific and amplified tyrosine phosphorylation of proteins in AML cells and suggest that amplified response might, at least in part, result from the increased amount of signaling molecules such as Stat5.","['Hagiwara, S', 'Iki, S', 'Urabe, A', 'Saeki, K', 'Miwa, A', 'Togawa, A', 'Ozawa, K', 'Takaku, F', 'Yuo, A']","['Hagiwara S', 'Iki S', 'Urabe A', 'Saeki K', 'Miwa A', 'Togawa A', 'Ozawa K', 'Takaku F', 'Yuo A']","['Department of Hematology, Research Institute and Hospital, International Medical Center of Japan, Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Japan,Int J Hematol,International journal of hematology,9111627,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Interleukin-3)', '0 (Milk Proteins)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (STAT5 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '9014-42-0 (Thrombopoietin)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.17 (Calcium-Calmodulin-Dependent Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 3)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Animals', 'Calcium-Calmodulin-Dependent Protein Kinases/analysis', 'Cells, Cultured/drug effects/metabolism/physiology', 'Cytokines/*pharmacology', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/analysis', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/pharmacology', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/pharmacology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/drug effects/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-3/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*metabolism/*pathology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*metabolism/*pathology', '*Milk Proteins', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 3', '*Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', '*Protein Biosynthesis', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*metabolism', 'Proteins/analysis/*chemistry', 'STAT5 Transcription Factor', 'Signal Transduction', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Thrombopoietin/pharmacology', 'Trans-Activators/analysis', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/pharmacology', 'p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases']",1999/01/14 00:00,1999/01/14 00:01,['1999/01/14 00:00'],"['1999/01/14 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/01/14 00:01 [medline]', '1999/01/14 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0925571098000954 [pii]', '10.1016/s0925-5710(98)00095-4 [doi]']",ppublish,Int J Hematol. 1998 Dec;68(4):387-401. doi: 10.1016/s0925-5710(98)00095-4.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A number of genes in both classes are expressed in a variety of hematopoietic cells. Two major categories of evidence implying the involvement of these genes in normal hematopoiesis have been demonstrated. First, the expression pattern of the homeobox genes in hematopoietic cells is lineage- and differentiation-stage specific. Second, enforced and suppressed expression of various homeobox genes cause defects in the hematopoietic cells of specific lineages. The reduction in myeloid, erythroid and B cell progenitors is found in mice with a disrupted HOXA9 gene. The thymuses of HOXB3-overexpressed marrow recipients contain a markedly decreased number of CD4/CD8 double-positive T cells. These examples suggest that the proper level of expression and timely down-regulation of some homeobox genes are necessary for normal hematopoiesis. Homeobox genes are also implicated in human and mouse leukemias. In human leukemias, a HOX gene (HOXA9) and two non-HOX homeobox genes (PBX1 and HOX11) are involved in chromosomal translocations. In mouse leukemias, provirus integrations cause aberrant expression of several HOX and non-HOX genes. Currently available information will be discussed separately on HOX and non-HOX genes, in normal and leukemic hematopoiesis, respectively.","['Chiba, S']",['Chiba S'],"['Department of Hematology/Oncology, University of Tokyo Hospital, Japan. schiba-tky@umin.ac.jp']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",Japan,Int J Hematol,International journal of hematology,9111627,,IM,"['Animals', 'Genes, Homeobox/*physiology', 'Hematopoiesis/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*genetics', 'Mice']",1999/01/14 00:00,1999/01/14 00:01,['1999/01/14 00:00'],"['1999/01/14 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/01/14 00:01 [medline]', '1999/01/14 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0925571098000930 [pii]', '10.1016/s0925-5710(98)00093-0 [doi]']",ppublish,Int J Hematol. 1998 Dec;68(4):343-53. doi: 10.1016/s0925-5710(98)00093-0.,,,,82,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Immunoblot analysis identified Bcl-XL as the predominant form of the Bcl-X protein in both pancreatic cancer tissues and cell lines, and demonstrated that both Bcl-XL and Mcl-1 protein levels were uniformly high in all cell lines. These results suggest that an imbalance between antiapoptosis proteins (such as Bcl-2, Bcl-XL, and Mcl-1) and proapoptotic proteins (such as Bax and Bcl-Xs) is involved in the distinctive biologic features of adenocarcinomas of the pancreas.

PML localises to distinct nuclear multi-protein complexes termed ND10, Kr bodies, PML nuclear bodies and PML oncogenic domains (PODs), which are disrupted in APL and are the targets for immediate early viral proteins, although little is known about their function. In a yeast two-hybrid screen, we first identified a ubiquitin-like protein named PIC1 (now known as SUMO-1), which interacts and co-localises with PML in vivo. More recent studies have now shown that SUMO-1 covalently modifies a number of target proteins including PML, RanGAP1 and IkappaBalpha and is proposed to play a role in either targeting modified proteins and/or inhibiting their degradation. The precise molecular role for the SUMO-1 modification of PML is unclear, and the specific lysine residues within PML that are targeted for modification and the PML sub-domains necessary for mediating the modification in vivo are unknown. Here we show that SUMO-1 covalently modifies PML both in vivo and in vitro and that the modification is mediated either directly or indirectly by the interaction of UBC9 with PML through the RING finger domain. Using site-specific mutagenesis, we have identified the primary PML-SUMO-1 modification site as being part of the nuclear localisation signal (Lys487 or Lys490). However SUMO-1 modification is not essential for PML nuclear localisation as only nuclear PML is modified. The sequence of the modification site fits into a consensus sequence for SUMO-1 modification and we have identified several other nuclear proteins which could also be targets for SUMO-1. We show that SUMO-1 modification appears to be dependant on the correct subcellular compartmentalisation of target proteins. We also find that the APL-associated fusion protein PML-RARA is efficiently modified in vitro, resulting in a specific and SUMO-1-dependent degradation of PML-RARA. Our results provide significant insights into the role of SUMO-1 modification of PML in both normal cells and the APL disease state.","['Duprez, E', 'Saurin, A J', 'Desterro, J M', 'Lallemand-Breitenbach, V', 'Howe, K', 'Boddy, M N', 'Solomon, E', 'de The, H', 'Hay, R T', 'Freemont, P S']","['Duprez E', 'Saurin AJ', 'Desterro JM', 'Lallemand-Breitenbach V', 'Howe K', 'Boddy MN', 'Solomon E', 'de The H', 'Hay RT', 'Freemont PS']","['Molecular Structure and Function Laboratory, Imperial Cancer Research Fund, London WC2A 3PX, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,J Cell Sci,Journal of cell science,0052457,"['0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Localization Signals)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (SUMO-1 Protein)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '0 (Ubiquitins)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)', 'EC 2.3.2.23 (Ubiquitin-Conjugating Enzymes)', 'EC 6.- (Ligases)', 'EC 6.3.2.- (ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme UBC9)']",IM,"['Consensus Sequence', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Humans', 'Ligases/*metabolism', 'Models, Biological', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutagenesis, Site-Directed', 'Neoplasm Proteins/analysis/*metabolism', 'Nuclear Localization Signals', 'Nuclear Matrix/metabolism', '*Nuclear Proteins', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins', 'SUMO-1 Protein', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Transcription Factors/analysis/*metabolism', 'Translocation, Genetic', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins', '*Ubiquitin-Conjugating Enzymes', 'Ubiquitins/*pharmacology']",1999/01/14 00:00,1999/01/14 00:01,['1999/01/14 00:00'],"['1999/01/14 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/01/14 00:01 [medline]', '1999/01/14 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Cell Sci. 1999 Feb;112 ( Pt 3):381-93.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

B-CLL cells with 11q deletion carried significantly lower levels of the adhesion molecules CD11a/CD18 (integrin alphaL/beta2), CD11c/CD18 (integrin alphaX/beta2), CD31 (PECAM-1), CD48, and CD58 (LFA-3).

Reduced CD45 levels and low-level expression of CD49d correlated with decreased overall survival. B-CLL cells with or without 11q deletion did not differ in their growth fractions, expression levels of transcription factor NF-kappaB, or their response to mitogenic stimuli.

In the present study, we examined function of a mutant gammac chain (A156V) isolated from an X-SCID patient and found that T cells expressing the mutant gammac chain were selectively impaired in their responses to IL-4 or IL-7 compared with the wild-type gammac chain expressing cells although responses to IL-2 or IL-15 were relatively maintained. The result shows that IL-4- and/or IL-7-induced signaling through the gammac chain is critical for T-cell development and plays an important role in the development of the X-SCID phenotype.","['Kumaki, S', 'Ishii, N', 'Minegishi, M', 'Tsuchiya, S', 'Cosman, D', 'Sugamura, K', 'Konno, T']","['Kumaki S', 'Ishii N', 'Minegishi M', 'Tsuchiya S', 'Cosman D', 'Sugamura K', 'Konno T']","['Department of Pediatric Oncology, Institute of Development, Aging and Cancer, Tohoku University, Sendai, Japan. kumakis@europa.idac.tohoku.ac.jp']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Interleukin-7)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-2)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-7)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '207137-56-2 (Interleukin-4)', '21820-51-9 (Phosphotyrosine)']",IM,"['Genetic Linkage', 'Humans', 'Immunoblotting', 'Immunosorbent Techniques', 'Infant', 'Interleukin-4/pharmacology/*physiology', 'Interleukin-7/pharmacology/*physiology', 'Leukemia, T-Cell', 'Male', 'Mutation', 'Phosphotyrosine/analysis/metabolism', 'Receptors, Interleukin-2/genetics', 'Receptors, Interleukin-7/genetics', 'Recombinant Proteins', 'Severe Combined Immunodeficiency/*genetics', 'Signal Transduction', 'T-Lymphocytes/metabolism', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', '*X Chromosome']",1999/01/13 00:00,1999/01/13 00:01,['1999/01/13 00:00'],"['1999/01/13 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/01/13 00:01 [medline]', '1999/01/13 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)57554-X [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1999 Jan 15;93(2):607-12.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Among normal leukocytes, CD3(-)CD16(+) or CD3(-)CD56(+) lymphocytes, ie, natural killer (NK) cells, express relatively high levels of P-gp, but little is known about P-gp in abnormally expanded NK cells. In this study, we examined the expression and activity of P-gp on NK cells derived from three normal donors, six patients with indolent NK cell-lineage granular lymphocyte-proliferative disorder (NK-GLPD), three patients with aggressive NK cell tumors (one NK cell leukemia and two nasal NK cell lymphoma), and two NK cell lines. By flow cytometric analysis using the monoclonal antibody (MoAb) MRK16 and rhodamine 123 dye (Rh123), P-gp expression and the efflux of Rh123 were found in all NK samples except one NK cell line. The Rh123 efflux of NK cells was inhibited by cyclosporin A (CsA) and its analogue PSC 833, but the aggressive NK tumor cells were less inhibited than were the other NK cells. The percent inhibition of efflux in the normal NK cells, indolent NK-GLPD cells and aggressive NK cell tumors was 81.8% +/- 0. 9%, 93.4% +/- 3.1% and 36.9% +/- 11.7%, respectively, by 1 micromol/L CsA, and 80.2% +/- 3.6%, 91.7% +/- 2.6% and 32.7% +/- 10. 1%, respectively, by 1 micromol/L PSC833. In reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis, the low inhibitory effect of P-gp modulators in aggressive NK cell tumors did not correlate to the expression level of MDR1 gene, multidrug resistance-associated protein gene, or human canalicular multispecific organic anion transporter gene. This phenomenon could be related to the presence of other transporters or to unknown cellular or membrane changes. Some patients with NK cell tumors have been reported to show a highly aggressive clinical course and to be refractory to chemotherapy, and this could be related to the expression of P-gp on NK cells. Our results suggest that, although the inhibitors for P-gp have been used in combination with chemotherapy in some hematologic tumors, these inhibitors may be less effective against aggressive NK cell tumors.","['Egashira, M', 'Kawamata, N', 'Sugimoto, K', 'Kaneko, T', 'Oshimi, K']","['Egashira M', 'Kawamata N', 'Sugimoto K', 'Kaneko T', 'Oshimi K']","['Department of Hematology, Juntendo University School of Medicine, Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (CD56 Antigen)', '0 (Cyclosporins)', '0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)', '0 (Receptors, IgG)', '83HN0GTJ6D (Cyclosporine)', 'Q7ZP55KF3X (valspodar)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/*analysis/antagonists & inhibitors/physiology', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'CD56 Antigen/analysis', 'Cell Line', 'Child', 'Cyclosporine/*pharmacology', 'Cyclosporins/*pharmacology', 'Female', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes, MDR/genetics', 'Humans', '*Immunosuppressive Agents', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*chemistry/immunology', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/metabolism', 'Lymphoproliferative Disorders/metabolism', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Receptors, IgG/analysis', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction']",1999/01/13 00:00,1999/01/13 00:01,['1999/01/13 00:00'],"['1999/01/13 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/01/13 00:01 [medline]', '1999/01/13 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)57553-8 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1999 Jan 15;93(2):599-606.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although a number of genetic conditions have been associated with MDS and MPS, the overall contribution of inherited predispositions is uncertain. We report a retrospective study examining clinical features, genetic associations, and outcomes in 167 children with MDS and MPS. Of these patients, 48 had an associated constitutional disorder. One hundred one patients had adult-type myelodysplastic syndrome (A-MDS), 60 had juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia (JMML), and 6 infants with Down syndrome had a transient myeloproliferative syndrome (TMS). JMML was characterized by young age at onset and prominent hepatosplenomegaly, whereas patients with A-MDS were older and had little or no organomegaly. The most common cytogenetic abnormalities were monosomy 7 or del(7q) (53 cases); this was common both in patients with JMML and those with A-MDS. Leukemic transformation was observed in 32% of patients, usually within 2 years of diagnosis. Survival was 25% at 16 years. Favorable prognostic features at diagnosis included age less than 2 years and a hemoglobin F level of less than 10%. Older patients tended to present with an adult-type MDS that is accommodated within the French-American-British system. In contrast, infants and young children typically developed unique disorders with overlapping features of MDS and MPS. Although the type and intensity of therapy varied markedly in this study, the overall outcome was poor except in patients with TMS.","['Luna-Fineman, S', 'Shannon, K M', 'Atwater, S K', 'Davis, J', 'Masterson, M', 'Ortega, J', 'Sanders, J', 'Steinherz, P', 'Weinberg, V', 'Lange, B J']","['Luna-Fineman S', 'Shannon KM', 'Atwater SK', 'Davis J', 'Masterson M', 'Ortega J', 'Sanders J', 'Steinherz P', 'Weinberg V', 'Lange BJ']","['University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA 94143, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,['9034-63-3 (Fetal Hemoglobin)'],IM,"['Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 7', 'Female', 'Fetal Hemoglobin/metabolism', 'Gene Deletion', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Leukemia/etiology', 'Male', 'Monosomy', '*Myelodysplastic Syndromes/diagnosis/genetics/therapy', '*Myeloproliferative Disorders/diagnosis/genetics/therapy', 'Prognosis', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Rate']",1999/01/13 00:00,1999/01/13 00:01,['1999/01/13 00:00'],"['1999/01/13 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/01/13 00:01 [medline]', '1999/01/13 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)57539-3 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1999 Jan 15;93(2):459-66.,"['CA13539/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'M01-RR01271/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', 'R01-CA72614/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In myeloid cells, such mutations act in a dominant-negative manner leading to hyperproliferation and lack of differentiation in response to G-CSF. However, why these truncated receptors are dominant in function over wild-type receptors has remained unclear. We report that ligand-induced internalization of truncated G-CSF-R is severely impaired compared with the wild-type receptor, which results in sustained activation of STAT proteins. Strikingly, in cells coexpressing both truncated and wild-type forms, the truncated receptors acted dominantly with regard to both internalization and sustained activation. Site-directed mutagenesis of the C-terminus showed that receptor tyrosines in this region were dispensable for internalization, whereas a di-leucine-containing motif in Box B3 played some role. However, loss of the di-leucine motif was not the critical determinant of the sustained activation status of truncated receptors. These data suggest that defective internalization, leading to extended receptor activation, is a major cause of the dominant hyperproliferative effect of truncated G-CSF receptors, which is only partially due to the loss of a di-leucine motif present in the Box B3 region of the full-length receptor.","['Ward, A C', 'van Aesch, Y M', 'Schelen, A M', 'Touw, I P']","['Ward AC', 'van Aesch YM', 'Schelen AM', 'Touw IP']","['Institute of Hematology, Erasmus University, Rotterdam, The Netherlands. ward@hema.fgg.eur.nl']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Milk Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '0 (STAT1 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT1 protein, human)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT3 protein, human)', '0 (STAT5 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Stat1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Stat3 protein, mouse)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '22144-77-0 (Cytochalasin D)', '42HK56048U (Tyrosine)', 'GMW67QNF9C (Leucine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cytochalasin D/pharmacology', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/metabolism', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leucine', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics', 'Mice', '*Milk Proteins', 'Mutagenesis, Site-Directed', '*Mutation', 'Neutropenia/*congenital/*genetics', 'Receptors, Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/chemistry/*genetics/*metabolism', 'STAT1 Transcription Factor', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor', 'STAT5 Transcription Factor', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Trans-Activators/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tyrosine']",1999/01/13 00:00,1999/01/13 00:01,['1999/01/13 00:00'],"['1999/01/13 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/01/13 00:01 [medline]', '1999/01/13 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)57538-1 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1999 Jan 15;93(2):447-58.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here we show that a critical domain in the G-CSFR that mediates ligand internalization is deleted in mutant G-CSFR forms from patients with SCN/AML. Deletion of this domain results in impaired ligand internalization, defective receptor downmodulation, and enhanced growth signaling.

RESULTS: Of the 875 deaths that occurred before 1995, 258 were due to cancer as the underlying cause. External comparisons of male subjects with the U.S. white male population indicated that the workers had lower rates of dying from all causes and all cancers, but a higher rate of dying from leukemia. Internal comparisons of workers exposed at different dose levels, using risk-set analyses with adjustment for confounders, demonstrated an increased mortality rate in workers exposed to 200 mSv for hemato- and lymphopoietic cancers and for lung cancer. Mortality rates for total cancers and ""radiosensitive"" solid cancers increased monotonically with cumulative radiation dose, but no trends were observed for ""nonradiosensitive"" cancers. CONCLUSIONS: Despite possible residual confounding and low precision for estimating effects on specific cancers, these findings indicate that chronic, low-level radiation exposure may have more generalized carcinogenic effects than have been observed in most previous investigations. Such effects may have become evident as a result of the relatively long follow-up period in the present study.","['Ritz, B', 'Morgenstern, H', 'Froines, J', 'Young, B B']","['Ritz B', 'Morgenstern H', 'Froines J', 'Young BB']","['Department of Epidemiology, UCLA School of Public Health 90095-1772, USA.

There is a paucity of data concerning factors that affect the total yield of three tandem leukaphereses. METHODS: Factors affecting the yield of PBPCs were analyzed in a series of 121 consecutive patients including 36 with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, two with Hodgkin's disease, four with multiple myeloma, 44 with acute leukemia, 20 with breast cancer and 15 with other solid tumors. PBPCs were mobilized using granulocyte-colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) alone (group I, n = 15), or after conventional-dose (group II, n = 70) or high-dose (group III, n = 36) chemotherapy followed by G-CSF. The total yield of three tandem PBPC collections for each patient was assessed by the number of mononuclear cells (MNCs), CD34+ cells and colony-forming units of granulocyte macrophages (CFU-GM). The factors evaluated included age, sex, diagnosis, history of marrow involvement, previous radiotherapy, the number of prior chemotherapy cycles and mobilization method. The two -sample t-test and logistic regression analysis were performed for univariate and multivariate analysis, respectively. RESULTS: With univariate analysis, a diagnosis of acute leukemia, positive history of bone marrow involvement, more chemotherapy cycles and mobilization with high-dose chemotherapy adversely affected the yields of CD34+ cells. By multivariate analysis, Group II had higher yields of MNCs (p = 0.039), CFU-GM (p = 0.002) and CD34+ cells (p = 0.011) than Group III. Fewer cycles of prior chemotherapy is the common favorable factor for the yields of both CD34+ cells (p = 0.016) and CFU-GM (p = 0.017). CONCLUSIONS: The number of prior chemotherapy cycles adversely affects progenitor cell yield. Conventional-dose chemotherapy followed by G-CSF seems to be the mobilization methods of choice for heavily pretreated cancer patients with limited bone marrow reserve. PBPCs should be harvested early, when the tumor burden is less, to avoid cumulative marrow toxicity from chemotherapy.","['Lin, J S', 'Tzeng, C H', 'Hu, H Y', 'Yung, C H']","['Lin JS', 'Tzeng CH', 'Hu HY', 'Yung CH']","['Department of Medicine, Veterans General Hospital-Taipei, Taiwan, ROC.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",China (Republic : 1949- ),Zhonghua Yi Xue Za Zhi (Taipei),Zhonghua yi xue za zhi = Chinese medical journal; Free China ed,0005327,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antigens, CD34/analysis', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Mobilization', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cells/drug effects', 'Humans', '*Leukapheresis', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms/*therapy']",1999/01/13 00:00,1999/01/13 00:01,['1999/01/13 00:00'],"['1999/01/13 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/01/13 00:01 [medline]', '1999/01/13 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Zhonghua Yi Xue Za Zhi (Taipei). 1998 Dec;61(12):700-7.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Subsequently, the bases of the sLexexpression control mechanism were examined at the levels of enzymatic activities and transcripts of glycosyltransferases.

In contrast CNTF was measurable only in 15 (22.7%) patients with RA and 24 (33.3%) normal individuals. The highest IL-6 and sIL-6R levels were found in the patients with Stages 3 and 4 of RA activity and the lowest in the control group. In contrast there were no statistically significant differences between the LIF and CNTF levels in RA patients and normal individuals. We found positive correlation between IL-6 and sIL-6R concentrations and Ritchie's index and a lack of such correlation with LIF and CNTF. IL-6 serum level correlated positively with the disease duration, but sIL-6R, LIF and CNTF did not. Serum sIL-6R/IL-6 ratio was significantly lower in RA patients than in healthy controls. In conclusion, an increase in the serum levels of IL-6 and sIL-6R, but not LIF and CNTF concentrations, may be useful markers for RA activity.","['Robak, T', 'Gladalska, A', 'Stepien, H', 'Robak, E']","['Robak T', 'Gladalska A', 'Stepien H', 'Robak E']","['Institute of Internal Medicine, Medical University of Lodz, Copernicus Hospital, Poland.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Mediators Inflamm,Mediators of inflammation,9209001,"['0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (Ciliary Neurotrophic Factor)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Nerve Tissue Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-6)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Arthritis, Rheumatoid/blood/*immunology', 'Biomarkers/blood', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Ciliary Neurotrophic Factor', 'Female', 'Growth Inhibitors/blood', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-6/*blood', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Lymphokines/blood', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Nerve Tissue Proteins/blood', 'Receptors, Interleukin-6/*blood', 'Solubility']",1999/01/12 00:00,1999/01/12 00:01,['1999/01/12 00:00'],"['1999/01/12 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/01/12 00:01 [medline]', '1999/01/12 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/09629359890875 [doi]'],ppublish,Mediators Inflamm. 1998;7(5):347-53. doi: 10.1080/09629359890875.,,,PMC1781865,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We investigated the regulation of human PML expression by interferons (IFNs) and IL-1 in various human haematopoietic lines (U937, THP1, HL60, NB4), in human diploid fibroblasts and in human peripheral blood leukocytes. Cytokine-induced modulation of PML expression was assessed by Northern blot analyses, flow cytometry studies and in situ immunolabelling. Our data show that IFNs and IL-1 upregulate PML transcript and protein expression in a time and dose-dependent manner. In situ immunolabelling revealed that upregulation of protein expression by IFN-alpha is a consequence of a marked increase in both the number and the intensity of the staining of so-called PML nuclear bodies.

Leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) is unique in that it has independent neurotrophic and myotrophic actions. The aim of this study was to explain this finding by establishing the existence of anterograde axonal transport of LIF from the site of nerve division to denervated muscles. Using 125I LIF, administered topically via an entubulation repair of divided rat sciatic nerve, we monitored its subsequent distribution by measuring the radioactivity associated with nerve segments and denervated muscles. We established that LIF preferentially accumulated in denervated muscles, a process we could reduce by 70% after tightly ligating the intervening nerve, confirming the presence of anterograde axonal transport. This was most likely an active mode of transport that ceased approximately 24 h after nerve division, establishing a narrow clinical time frame within which the myotrophic action of LIF could be optimized following nerve repair.","['Bennett, T M', 'Dowsing, B J', 'Austin, L', 'Messina, A', 'Nicola, N A', 'Morrison, W A']","['Bennett TM', 'Dowsing BJ', 'Austin L', 'Messina A', 'Nicola NA', 'Morrison WA']","[""Bernard O'Brien Institute of Microsurgery, St. Vincent's Hospital, Victoria, Australia.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Muscle Nerve,Muscle & nerve,7803146,"['0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lymphokines)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Autoradiography', 'Axonal Transport/*physiology', 'Axotomy', 'Growth Inhibitors/*metabolism/pharmacology', '*Interleukin-6', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Lymphokines/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'Male', 'Muscle Denervation', 'Muscle, Skeletal/innervation', 'Rats', 'Rats, Sprague-Dawley', 'Sciatic Nerve/drug effects/*physiology', 'Time Factors', 'Wallerian Degeneration/metabolism']",1999/01/12 03:01,2000/06/20 09:00,['1999/01/12 03:01'],"['1999/01/12 03:01 [pubmed]', '2000/06/20 09:00 [medline]', '1999/01/12 03:01 [entrez]']","['10.1002/(SICI)1097-4598(199901)22:1<78::AID-MUS12>3.0.CO;2-I [pii]', '10.1002/(sici)1097-4598(199901)22:1<78::aid-mus12>3.0.co;2-i [doi]']",ppublish,Muscle Nerve. 1999 Jan;22(1):78-87. doi: 10.1002/(sici)1097-4598(199901)22:1<78::aid-mus12>3.0.co;2-i.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Two-color immunofluorescence with anti-ALP and anti-CD16 showed that the PNH clone was essentially negative for mNAP, whereas residual normal neutrophils (CD16+) had levels slightly higher than those in normal individuals. Highly reproducible results were obtained in the blood samples which were stored at 4 degrees C for at least 24 hr without any treatment prior to immunofluorescent staining.

Further research revealed that this agent, contrarily to conventional chemotherapy with busulfan or hydroxyurea, eliminates leukemic hematopoietic cells having Philadelphia chromosome (Ph1-positive) in about 20% of patients, leading to the phase of cytogenetic remission. Comparison of the efficiency of IFN-alpha with conventional chemotherapy was carried out in several randomized clinical trials. It was found, that IFN-alpha delays the occurrence of blastic phase of CML and prolongs patients life span. It does not create, however, a likely chance of full recovery. The results of the randomized trails, carried out in France, showed that the combination of IFN-alpha and cytarabine as compared with INF-alpha alone, increases the rate of major cytogenetic response and prolongs survival in the chronic phase of CML. IFN-alpha efficiency in acceleration and blastic transformation phases of CML has not been proven so far, although this drug may be of certain value in combination with hydroxyurea or other cytostatic agents. At present, it is more often considered that IFN-alpha should be a first line therapy in newly diagnosed CML in its chronic phase, if due to absence of appropriate donors or advanced age, allogenic bone marrow transplantation cannot be performed.","['Robak, T']",['Robak T'],"['Department of Hematology, University Medical School, Pabianicka, Lodz, Poland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Switzerland,Arch Immunol Ther Exp (Warsz),Archivum immunologiae et therapiae experimentalis,0114365,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Interferon-alpha)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Interferon-alpha/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/immunology/mortality/pathology', 'Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic', 'Treatment Outcome']",1999/01/12 00:00,1999/01/12 00:01,['1999/01/12 00:00'],"['1999/01/12 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/01/12 00:01 [medline]', '1999/01/12 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Arch Immunol Ther Exp (Warsz). 1998;46(6):347-53.,,,,42,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the present study, we show that both c-myc mRNA and c-Myc protein levels are reduced only in oxysterol-sensitive and not in oxysterol-resistant cells after treatment with concentrations of 25OHC that kill the sensitive CEM cells. The repression of c-Myc protein precedes c-myc mRNA reduction, and both events occur before the onset of cell death. Our data suggest that 25OHC-induced suppression of c-myc gene expression in CEM cells results from posttranscriptional regulation.

Previous experiments indicated that early bone marrow infection is essential for the efficient development of T lymphoma. In order to identify the cellular pathway of infection in the bone marrow, infection of mice with a helper-free replication-defective M-MuLV-based retroviral vector was carried out. Such a vector will undergo only one round of infection, without spreading to other cells; thus, cells infected by the initially injected virus (directly infected cells) can be identified. For these experiments, the BAG vector that expresses bacterial beta-galactosidase was employed. Neonatal NIH/Swiss mice were inoculated intraperitoneally with ca. 10(6) infectious units of a BAG vector pseudotyped with M-MuLV proteins, and bone marrow cells were recovered 2 to 12 days postinfection. Single-cell suspensions were tested for infection by staining with X-Gal (5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-beta-D-galactopyranoside) or by immunofluorescence with an anti-beta-galactosidase antibody. Two sizes of infected cells were evident: large multinucleated cells and small nondescript (presumptively hematopoietic) cells. Secondary stains for lineage-specific markers indicated that the large cells were osteoclasts. Some of the small cells expressed nonspecific esterase, which placed them in the myeloid lineage, but they lacked markers for hematopoietic progenitors (mac-1, gr-1, sca-1, and CD34). These results provide evidence for primary M-MuLV infection of osteoclasts or osteoclast progenitors in the bone marrow, and they suggest that known hematopoietic progenitors are not primary targets for infection. However, the subsequent spread of infection to hematopoietic progenitors was indicated, since bone marrow from mice infected in parallel with replication-competent wild-type M-MuLV showed detectable infection in small cells positive for mac-1 or CD34, as well as in osteoclasts.","['Okimoto, M A', 'Fan, H']","['Okimoto MA', 'Fan H']","['Department of Molecular Biology and Biochemistry and Cancer Research Institute, University of California, Irvine, California 92697-3900, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation)', '0 (Antigens, Ly)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Galectin 3)', '0 (Isoenzymes)', '0 (Ly6a protein, mouse)', '0 (Macrophage-1 Antigen)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', 'EC 3.1.1.7 (Acetylcholinesterase)', 'EC 3.1.3.2 (Acid Phosphatase)', 'EC 3.1.3.2 (Tartrate-Resistant Acid Phosphatase)']",IM,"['3T3 Cells', 'Acetylcholinesterase/analysis', 'Acid Phosphatase/analysis', 'Animals', 'Animals, Newborn', 'Antigens, CD34/analysis', 'Antigens, Differentiation/analysis', 'Antigens, Ly/analysis', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/analysis', 'Bone Marrow Cells/chemistry/*virology', 'Galectin 3', 'Genetic Vectors/*physiology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/immunology', 'Isoenzymes/analysis', 'Leukemia, Experimental/blood/*virology', 'Macrophage-1 Antigen/analysis', 'Macrophages/immunology', 'Megakaryocytes/enzymology', 'Membrane Proteins/analysis', 'Mice', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/*physiology', 'Osteoclasts/enzymology/*virology', 'Retroviridae Infections/blood/*virology', 'Tartrate-Resistant Acid Phosphatase', 'Tumor Virus Infections/blood/*virology']",1999/01/09 00:00,1999/01/09 00:01,['1999/01/09 00:00'],"['1999/01/09 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/01/09 00:01 [medline]', '1999/01/09 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.73.2.1617-1623.1999 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 1999 Feb;73(2):1617-23. doi: 10.1128/JVI.73.2.1617-1623.1999.,"['R01 CA032455/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 AI007319/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', '5T32 AI07319/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'CA32455/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,PMC103987,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Our results demonstrate for the first time that E4orf3 can cooperate with adenovirus E1A and E1A plus E1B proteins to transform primary baby rat kidney cells, acting synergistically with E4orf6 in the presence of E1B gene products. Transformed rat cells expressing E4orf3 exhibit morphological alterations, higher growth rates and saturation densities, and increased tumorigenicity compared with transformants expressing E1 proteins only. Consistent with previous results for adenovirus-infected cells, the E4orf3 protein is immunologically restricted to discrete nuclear structures known as PML oncogenic domains (PODs) in transformed rat cells. As opposed to E4orf6, the ability of E4orf3 to promote oncogenic cell growth is probably not linked to a modulation of p53 functions and stability. Instead, our results indicate that the transforming activities of E4orf3 are due to combinatorial effects that involve the binding to the adenovirus 55-kDa E1B protein and the colocalization with PODs independent from interactions with the PML gene product. These data fit well with a model in which the reorganization of PODs may trigger a cascade of processes that cause uncontrolled cell proliferation and neoplastic growth. In sum, our results provide strong evidence for the idea that interactions with PODs by viral proteins are linked to oncogenic transformation.","['Nevels, M', 'Tauber, B', 'Kremmer, E', 'Spruss, T', 'Wolf, H', 'Dobner, T']","['Nevels M', 'Tauber B', 'Kremmer E', 'Spruss T', 'Wolf H', 'Dobner T']","['Institut fur Medizinische Mikrobiologie und Hygiene, Universitat Regensburg, D-93053 Regensburg, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Adenovirus E1A Proteins)', '0 (Adenovirus E1B Proteins)', '0 (Adenovirus E4 Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Pml protein, mouse)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)']",IM,"['Adenovirus E1A Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Adenovirus E1B Proteins/metabolism', 'Adenovirus E4 Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Adenoviruses, Human/genetics/*metabolism', 'Animals', 'Carcinogenicity Tests', 'Cell Division', '*Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Mice', 'Mice, Nude', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics/metabolism', '*Nuclear Proteins', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'Rats', 'Rats, Sprague-Dawley', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins']",1999/01/09 00:00,1999/01/09 00:01,['1999/01/09 00:00'],"['1999/01/09 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/01/09 00:01 [medline]', '1999/01/09 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.73.2.1591-1600.1999 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 1999 Feb;73(2):1591-600. doi: 10.1128/JVI.73.2.1591-1600.1999.,,,PMC103984,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Murine leukemia virions pseudotyped with Ebo-GP contain almost exclusively processed glycoprotein, indicating that this is the mature form of Ebo-GP. Mutational analysis identified a dibasic motif, reminiscent of furin-like protease processing sites, as the Ebo-GP cleavage site. However, analysis of Ebo-GP processing in LoVo cells that lack the proprotein convertase furin demonstrated that furin is not required for processing of Ebo-GP. In sharp contrast to other viral systems, we found that an uncleaved mutant of Ebo-GP was able to mediate infection of various cell lines as efficiently as the wild-type, proteolytically cleaved glycoprotein, indicating that cleavage is not required for the activation of Ebo-GP despite the conservation of a dibasic cleavage site in all filoviral envelope glycoproteins.","['Wool-Lewis, R J', 'Bates, P']","['Wool-Lewis RJ', 'Bates P']","['Department of Microbiology, University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19104-6076, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Epitopes)', '0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)', '0 (envelope glycoprotein, Ebola virus)', 'EC 3.4.- (Endopeptidases)', 'EC 3.4.21.- (Subtilisins)', 'EC 3.4.21.75 (Furin)']",IM,"['3T3 Cells', 'Animals', 'Binding Sites', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Line, Transformed', 'Cricetinae', 'Ebolavirus/genetics/*metabolism', 'Endopeptidases/metabolism', 'Epitopes', 'Furin', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Mutagenesis, Site-Directed', 'Oxidation-Reduction', 'Protein Denaturation', '*Protein Processing, Post-Translational', 'Rabbits', 'Subtilisins', 'Viral Envelope Proteins/genetics/*metabolism']",1999/01/09 00:00,1999/01/09 00:01,['1999/01/09 00:00'],"['1999/01/09 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/01/09 00:01 [medline]', '1999/01/09 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.73.2.1419-1426.1999 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 1999 Feb;73(2):1419-26. doi: 10.1128/JVI.73.2.1419-1426.1999.,['CA63531/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,PMC103966,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This signal is involved in the trafficking and endocytosis of membrane receptors via clathrin-associated AP-1 and AP-2 adaptor complexes.

Flow cytometry and confocal microscopy studies showed that this motif is a major determinant of the cell surface expression of the CD8-HTLV chimera. The YXXO motif also plays a key role in subcellular distribution of the envelope of lentiviruses HIV-1 and SIV. However, these viruses, which encode TM proteins with a long cytoplasmic domain, have additional determinants distal to the YXXO motif that participate in regulating cell surface expression. We have also used the yeast two-hybrid system and in vitro binding assays to demonstrate that all three retroviral YXXO motifs interact with the micro1 and micro2 subunits of AP complexes and that the C-terminal regions of HIV-1 and SIV TM proteins interact with the beta2 adaptin subunit. The TM-CDs of HTLV-1, HIV-1, and SIV also interact with the whole AP complexes. These results clearly demonstrate that the cell surface expression of retroviral envelope glycoproteins is governed by interactions with adaptor complexes. The YXXO-based signal is the major determinant of this interaction for the HTLV-1 TM, which contains a short cytoplasmic domain, whereas the lentiviruses HIV-1 and SIV have additional determinants distal to this signal that are also involved.","['Berlioz-Torrent, C', 'Shacklett, B L', 'Erdtmann, L', 'Delamarre, L', 'Bouchaert, I', 'Sonigo, P', 'Dokhelar, M C', 'Benarous, R']","['Berlioz-Torrent C', 'Shacklett BL', 'Erdtmann L', 'Delamarre L', 'Bouchaert I', 'Sonigo P', 'Dokhelar MC', 'Benarous R']","['CJF 97/03 INSERM, Interactions Moleculaires, Hote-Pathogene, Institut Cochin de Genetique Moleculaire, 75014 Paris, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Adaptor Protein Complex alpha Subunits)', '0 (Adaptor Protein Complex beta Subunits)', '0 (Adaptor Proteins, Vesicular Transport)', '0 (CD8 Antigens)', '0 (Clathrin)', '0 (Gene Products, env)', '0 (HIV Envelope Protein gp41)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Retroviridae Proteins, Oncogenic)', '0 (Viral Fusion Proteins)', '0 (env Gene Products, Human Immunodeficiency Virus)', '0 (gp21 protein, Human T-lymphotropic virus 1)', '0 (transmembrane protein, Simian immunodeficiency virus)', '42HK56048U (Tyrosine)']",IM,"['Adaptor Protein Complex alpha Subunits', 'Adaptor Protein Complex beta Subunits', 'Adaptor Proteins, Vesicular Transport', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Amino Acid Substitution', 'Animals', 'Binding Sites', 'CD8 Antigens/metabolism', 'Cell Membrane/metabolism', 'Clathrin/*metabolism', 'Cytoplasm/metabolism', 'Gene Products, env/genetics/*metabolism', 'HIV Envelope Protein gp41/genetics/*metabolism', 'HIV-1/genetics/*metabolism', 'Haplorhini', 'HeLa Cells', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/genetics/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Intracellular Fluid', 'Membrane Proteins/*metabolism', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Retroviridae Proteins, Oncogenic/genetics/*metabolism', 'Simian Immunodeficiency Virus/genetics/*metabolism', 'Subcellular Fractions', 'Tyrosine', 'Viral Fusion Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'env Gene Products, Human Immunodeficiency Virus']",1999/01/09 00:00,1999/01/09 00:01,['1999/01/09 00:00'],"['1999/01/09 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/01/09 00:01 [medline]', '1999/01/09 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.73.2.1350-1361.1999 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 1999 Feb;73(2):1350-61. doi: 10.1128/JVI.73.2.1350-1361.1999.,,,PMC103959,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The N-terminal motif has been implicated in in vitro signal transduction pathways from the external to the intracellular compartment and is also involved in infection and maintenance of high viral loads in sheep that have been experimentally infected with BLV. To determine the role of YXXL sequences in the replication of BLV in vitro, we changed the tyrosine or leucine residues of the N-terminal motif in an infectious molecular clone of BLV, pBLV-IF, to alanine to produce mutated proviruses designated Y487A, L490A, Y498A, L501A, and Y487/498A. Transient transfection of African green monkey kidney COS-1 cells with proviral DNAs that encoded wild-type and mutant sequences revealed that all of the mutated proviral DNAs synthesized mature envelope proteins and released virus particles into the growth medium. However, serial passages of fetal lamb kidney (FLK) cells, which are sensitive to infection with BLV, after transient transfection revealed that mutation of a second tyrosine residue in the N-terminal motif completely prevented the propagation of the virus. Similarly, Y498A and Y487/498A mutant BLV that was produced by the stably transfected COS-1 cells exhibited significantly reduced levels of cell-free virion-mediated transmission. Analysis of the protein compositions of mutant viruses demonstrated that lower levels of envelope protein were incorporated by two of the mutant virions than by wild-type and other mutant virions. Furthermore, a mutation of a second tyrosine residue decreased the specific binding of BLV particles to FLK cells and the capacity for viral penetration.

Tax, the viral protein, is thought to be crucial in the development of the disease, since it transforms healthy T cells in vitro and induces tumors in transgenic animals. We examined the effect of Tax activity on the growth of the interleukin-2 (IL-2)-dependent T-cell line CTLL-2. Stable expression of Tax in CTLL-2 transformed cell growth from being IL-2 dependent to IL-2 independent. Tax stimulated transcription through NF-kappaB and the cyclic AMP-responsive element-like sequence in the HTLV-1 promoter. The finding of Tax mutants segregating these two pathways suggested that the NF-kappaB pathway was essential for IL-2-independent growth of CTLL-2 cells while the CRE pathway was unnecessary. However, both pathways were necessary for another transformation-related activity (colony formation in soft agar) of CTLL-2/Tax. Our results show that Tax has at least two distinct activities on T cells, and suggest that Tax plays a crucial role in IL-2-independent T-cell transformation induced by HTLV-1, in addition to its well-known IL-2-dependent cell transformation.","['Iwanaga, Y', 'Tsukahara, T', 'Ohashi, T', 'Tanaka, Y', 'Arai, M', 'Nakamura, M', 'Ohtani, K', 'Koya, Y', 'Kannagi, M', 'Yamamoto, N', 'Fujii, M']","['Iwanaga Y', 'Tsukahara T', 'Ohashi T', 'Tanaka Y', 'Arai M', 'Nakamura M', 'Ohtani K', 'Koya Y', 'Kannagi M', 'Yamamoto N', 'Fujii M']","['Department of Microbiology, Tokyo Medical and Dental University, Yushima, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo 113, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (NF-kappa B)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis', 'Cell Division', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Transformation, Viral', 'Gene Products, tax/genetics/*metabolism', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/genetics/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-2/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'Mice', 'NF-kappa B/metabolism', 'T-Lymphocytes/cytology/*metabolism']",1999/01/09 00:00,1999/01/09 00:01,['1999/01/09 00:00'],"['1999/01/09 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/01/09 00:01 [medline]', '1999/01/09 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.73.2.1271-1277.1999 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 1999 Feb;73(2):1271-7. doi: 10.1128/JVI.73.2.1271-1277.1999.,,,PMC103950,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The relative contribution of antibodies to conformation-dependent epitopes, including those mediating virus neutralization as part of the humoral immune response, is not well defined. We assess in this report the relationship between defined linear and conformational epitopes and the antibodies elicited to these domains. First, five monoclonal antibodies to linear epitopes within gp46 were evaluated for their ability to abrogate binding of three human monoclonal antibodies that inhibit HTLV-1-mediated syncytia formation and recognize conformational epitopes. Binding of antibodies to conformational epitopes was unaffected by antibodies to linear epitopes throughout the carboxy-terminal half and central domain of HTLV-1 gp46. Second, an enzyme-linked immunoadsorbent assay was developed and used to measure serum antibodies to native and denatured gp46 from HTLV-1-infected individuals. In sera from infected individuals, reactivity to denatured gp46 had an average of 15% of the reactivity observed to native gp46. Third, serum antibodies from 24 of 25 of HTLV-1-infected individuals inhibited binding of a neutralizing human monoclonal antibody, PRH-7A, to a conformational epitope on gp46 that is common to HTLV-1 and -2. Thus, antibodies to conformational epitopes comprise the majority of the immune response to HTLV-1 gp46, and the epitopes recognized by these antibodies do not appear to involve sequences in previously described immunodominant linear epitopes.","['Hadlock, K G', 'Rowe, J', 'Foung, S K']","['Hadlock KG', 'Rowe J', 'Foung SK']","['Department of Pathology, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, California 94305, USA. khadlock@leland.stanford.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Deltaretrovirus Antibodies)', '0 (Epitopes, B-Lymphocyte)', '0 (Gene Products, env)', '0 (Retroviridae Proteins, Oncogenic)', '0 (gp46 protein, Human T-cell leukemia virus type I)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/immunology', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Line, Transformed', 'Deltaretrovirus Antibodies/*immunology', 'Epitopes, B-Lymphocyte/chemistry/*immunology', 'Gene Products, env/chemistry/*immunology', 'HTLV-I Infections/blood/*immunology', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Protein Conformation', 'Retroviridae Proteins, Oncogenic/chemistry/*immunology', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1999/01/09 00:00,1999/01/09 00:01,['1999/01/09 00:00'],"['1999/01/09 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/01/09 00:01 [medline]', '1999/01/09 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.73.2.1205-1212.1999 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 1999 Feb;73(2):1205-12. doi: 10.1128/JVI.73.2.1205-1212.1999.,['CA-06596/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,PMC103941,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have recently reported that in sheep, BLV protects the total population of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from ex vivo spontaneous apoptosis. This global decrease in the apoptosis rates resulted from both direct and indirect mechanisms which allow extension of cell survival. Although sheep are not natural hosts for BLV, these animals are prone to develop virus-induced leukemia at very high frequencies. Most infected cattle, however, remain clinically healthy. This difference in the susceptibilities to development of leukemia in these two species might be related to alterations of the apoptotic processes. Therefore, we designed this study to unravel the mechanisms of programmed cell death in cattle. We have observed that PBMCs from persistently lymphocytotic BLV-infected cows were more susceptible to spontaneous ex vivo apoptosis than cells from uninfected or aleukemic animals. These higher apoptosis rates were the consequence of an increased proportion of B cells exhibiting lower survival abilities. About one-third of the BLV-expressing cells did not survive the ex vivo culture conditions, demonstrating that viral expression is not strictly associated with cell survival in cattle. Surprisingly, culture supernatants from persistently lymphocytotic cows exhibited efficient antiapoptotic properties on both uninfected bovine and uninfected ovine cells. It thus appears that indirect inhibition of cell death can occur even in the presence of high apoptosis rates. Together, these results demonstrate that the protection against spontaneous apoptosis associated with BLV is different in cattle and in sheep. The higher levels of ex vivo apoptosis occurring in cattle might indicate a decreased susceptibility to development of leukemia in vivo.","['Dequiedt, F', 'Cantor, G H', 'Hamilton, V T', 'Pritchard, S M', 'Davis, W C', 'Kerkhofs, P', 'Burny, A', 'Kettmann, R', 'Willems, L']","['Dequiedt F', 'Cantor GH', 'Hamilton VT', 'Pritchard SM', 'Davis WC', 'Kerkhofs P', 'Burny A', 'Kettmann R', 'Willems L']","['Department of Applied Biochemistry and Biology, Molecular Biology and Animal Physiology Unit, Faculty of Agronomy, B5030 Gembloux, Belgium. dequiedt.f@fsagx.ac.be']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Culture Media, Conditioned)']",IM,"['Animals', '*Apoptosis', '*B-Lymphocytes', 'Cattle', 'Cattle Diseases/*immunology', 'Cell Survival', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Culture Media, Conditioned', 'Leukemia Virus, Bovine/*physiology', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/cytology', 'Lymphocytosis/blood/*veterinary', 'Sheep']",1999/01/09 00:00,1999/01/09 00:01,['1999/01/09 00:00'],"['1999/01/09 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/01/09 00:01 [medline]', '1999/01/09 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.73.2.1127-1137.1999 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 1999 Feb;73(2):1127-37. doi: 10.1128/JVI.73.2.1127-1137.1999.,,,PMC103933,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In order to gain further insight into the mechanisms of BLV silencing in these tumors, we have used the YR2 B-cell line, which was derived from the leukemic cells of a BLV-infected sheep. This cell line contains a single, monoclonally integrated, silent provirus, which cannot be reactivated either by stimulation in vitro or by in vivo injection of the tumor cells or cloned proviral DNA in sheep. Sequence analysis of the tax gene from the YR2 cell line identified two G-to-A transitions (G7924 to A7924 and G8149 to A8149) that result in E-to-K amino acid changes at positions 228 and 303 in the Tax protein. Following retroviral vector-mediated transfer of a wild-type tax gene into YR2 cells, we showed that BLV mRNA, viral proteins, and virions were produced, demonstrating that the cellular factors required for virus expression were present in the original YR2 cell line. Injection of this transduced YR2 cell line in sheep led to the rescue of replication-competent BLV proviruses. The integrated competent proviruses exhibited unique chimeric tax genes, which arose from homologous recombination between the transduced wild-type tax and the YR2-derived tax sequences. Furthermore, in one of these functional recombinant proviruses, only the A8149-to-G8149 reversion was present, providing clear evidence that the defect underlying the silent phenotype in YR2 cells results from a single C-terminal E303-to-K303 amino acid substitution in the BLV Tax protein. Our observations suggest that a single strategically located mutation in tax provides a mechanism for BLV inactivation in B-cell tumors.","['Van Den Broeke, A', 'Bagnis, C', 'Ciesiolka, M', 'Cleuter, Y', 'Gelderblom, H', 'Kerkhofs, P', 'Griebel, P', 'Mannoni, P', 'Burny, A']","['Van Den Broeke A', 'Bagnis C', 'Ciesiolka M', 'Cleuter Y', 'Gelderblom H', 'Kerkhofs P', 'Griebel P', 'Mannoni P', 'Burny A']","[""Laboratoire d'Investigation Clinique et d'Oncologie Experimentale, Institut Bordet, Universite Libre de Bruxelles, 1000 Brussels, Belgium. avdb@dbm.ulb.ac.be""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (RNA, Viral)', '0 (Viral Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'B-Lymphocytes/*virology', 'Base Sequence', 'DNA, Viral', 'Deltaretrovirus/physiology', 'Gene Products, tax/genetics/*physiology', 'Genetic Vectors', 'Leukemia Virus, Bovine/genetics/*physiology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Proviruses/genetics', 'RNA, Viral', 'Rats', 'Recombination, Genetic', 'Retroviridae', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA', 'Sheep', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Viral Proteins/biosynthesis', '*Virus Activation', 'Virus Assembly', 'Virus Integration']",1999/01/09 00:00,1999/01/09 00:01,['1999/01/09 00:00'],"['1999/01/09 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/01/09 00:01 [medline]', '1999/01/09 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.73.2.1054-1065.1999 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 1999 Feb;73(2):1054-65. doi: 10.1128/JVI.73.2.1054-1065.1999.,,,PMC103925,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Using indirect immunofluorescence in combination with fluorescence in situ hybridization, we colocalized the human papillomavirus (HPV) replicating proteins E1 and E2 and the replicating origin-containing plasmid to nuclear foci in transiently transfected cells. The host replication protein A (RP-A) was also colocalized to these foci. These nuclear structures were identified as active sites of viral DNA synthesis by bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) pulse-labeling. Unexpectedly, the great majority of RP-A and BrdU incorporation was found in these HPV replication domains. Furthermore, E1, E2, and RP-A were also colocalized to nuclear foci in the absence of an origin-containing plasmid. These observations suggest a spatial reorganization of the host DNA replication machinery upon HPV DNA replication or E1 and E2 expression. Alternatively, viral DNA replication might be targeted to host nuclear domains that are active during the late S phase, when such domains are limited in number. In a fraction of cells expressing E1 and E2, the promyelocytic leukemia protein, a component of nuclear domain 10 (ND10), was either partially or completely colocalized with E1 and E2. Since ND10 structures were recently hypothesized to be sites of bovine papillomavirus virion assembly, our observation suggests that HPV DNA amplification might be partially coupled to virion assembly.","['Swindle, C S', 'Zou, N', 'Van Tine, B A', 'Shaw, G M', 'Engler, J A', 'Chow, L T']","['Swindle CS', 'Zou N', 'Van Tine BA', 'Shaw GM', 'Engler JA', 'Chow LT']","['Departments of Biochemistry and Molecular Genetics, Schools of Medicine and Dentistry, University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, Alabama, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (E1 protein, Human papillomavirus type 11)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (RPA1 protein, human)', '0 (Replication Protein A)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '0 (Viral Proteins)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)']",IM,"['Cell Nucleus', 'DNA Replication', '*DNA, Viral', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*analysis/genetics', 'Humans', 'Neoplasm Proteins/analysis', 'Nuclear Proteins/analysis', 'Papillomaviridae/*genetics', 'Plasmids', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'Replication Origin', 'Replication Protein A', 'Transcription Factors/analysis', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins', 'Viral Proteins/*analysis/genetics', '*Virus Replication']",1999/01/09 00:00,1999/01/09 00:01,['1999/01/09 00:00'],"['1999/01/09 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/01/09 00:01 [medline]', '1999/01/09 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.73.2.1001-1009.1999 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 1999 Feb;73(2):1001-9. doi: 10.1128/JVI.73.2.1001-1009.1999.,"['P30 AI027767/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'AI20408/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 CA009467/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA36200/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 CA09467/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA036200/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,PMC103920,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Our results demonstrated that both changes in highly conserved PPT positions and a mutation that left only the cleavage-proximal half of the PPT intact led to delayed replication and reduced the colony-forming titer of replication defective retroviral vectors. A mutation that altered the cleavage proximal half of the PPT and certain 3' untranslated region mutations upstream of the PPT were incompatible with or severely impaired viral replication.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: The male CBA/H and DBA2 mouse was injected with 0, 128 or 256 Bqg(-1) 239Pu 12 weeks before mating with the normal CBA/H and C57B1 female respectively. CBA/H offspring were exposed to 3.3 Gy gamma-rays total body irradiation: BDF1 offspring were injected with 50 mg kg(-1) methyl nitrosourea (MNU). The offspring were assayed for changes in bone marrow progenitor cell numbers and chromosome aberrations and were followed up for subsequent induction of neoplasia. RESULTS: While the untreated mouse showed a normal distribution for cellularity, spleen colony-forming units (CFU-S) and fibroblastoid colony-forming units (CFU-F), significant numbers of PPI offspring presented levels outside the normal range. There was a tendency for them also to show increased, dose-related, levels of chromosomal aberrations. Offspring treated with irradiation or MNU developed an increased incidence of lympho-haemopoietic malignancies. CONCLUSIONS: These studies have shown that PPI results in offspring that are more susceptible to the induction of lymphohaemopoietic malignancy on encountering a secondary carcinogenic insult. This may be linked to inherited chromosomal instability and abnormal kinetics of haemopoiesis. The experiments indicate a potential mechanism by which an increased incidence of leukaemia may be linked to PPI.","['Lord, B I', 'Woolford, L B', 'Wang, L', 'McDonald, D', 'Lorimore, S A', 'Stones, V A', 'Wright, E G', 'Scott, D']","['Lord BI', 'Woolford LB', 'Wang L', 'McDonald D', 'Lorimore SA', 'Stones VA', 'Wright EG', 'Scott D']","['CRC Sections of Experimental Haematology and Molecular Genetics, Paterson Institute for Cancer Research, Christie Hospital NHS Trust, Manchester, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Int J Radiat Biol,International journal of radiation biology,8809243,"['0 (Carcinogens)', '0 (Mutagens)', '53023GN24M (Plutonium)', '684-93-5 (Methylnitrosourea)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Carcinogens/pharmacology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chromosome Aberrations/genetics', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'Female', 'Gamma Rays/adverse effects', 'Leukemia, Experimental/genetics', 'Male', 'Methylnitrosourea/pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred Strains', 'Mutagens/pharmacology', 'Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced/*genetics', 'Paternal Exposure/*adverse effects', 'Plutonium/adverse effects', 'Pregnancy', '*Prenatal Exposure Delayed Effects', 'Spleen/pathology', 'Whole-Body Irradiation']",1999/01/09 00:00,1999/01/09 00:01,['1999/01/09 00:00'],"['1999/01/09 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/01/09 00:01 [medline]', '1999/01/09 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/095530098140998 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Radiat Biol. 1998 Dec;74(6):721-8. doi: 10.1080/095530098140998.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Ionizing radiation induces delayed genetic instability which can be transmitted to the clonal offspring of the irradiated cell, so it is of considerable importance to determine whether radiation-induced genetic instability contributes to radiation-leukaemogenesis. RESULTS: The experimental data obtained using radiation-induced leukaemias in mouse models were reviewed, and an attempt was made to distinguish between the instability detectable in de novo cancers and that which is associated with ionising radiation. Genetic lesions identified in mouse leukaemias include non-clonal chromosomal aberrations, loss of heterozygosity, and minisatellite/microsatellite mutations. CONCLUSIONS: Studies of mouse radiation-induced leukaemias have detected evidence of genetic instability. However, with few exceptions, most of this instability was also observed during de novo multi-stage carcinogenesis. This raises the possibility that radiation induces ongoing genetic instability that is functionally indistinguishable to that implicated in de novo tumour progression.","['Plumb, M', 'Cleary, H', 'Wright, E']","['Plumb M', 'Cleary H', 'Wright E']","['MRC Radiation and Genome Stability Unit, Harwell, Didcot, Oxford. m.plumb@har.mrc.ac.uk']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",England,Int J Radiat Biol,International journal of radiation biology,8809243,,IM,"['Animals', 'Chromosome Aberrations/genetics', 'Chromosomes/radiation effects', 'DNA Damage/radiation effects', '*Disease Models, Animal', 'Genes/*radiation effects', 'Leukemia, Radiation-Induced/*genetics', 'Loss of Heterozygosity/genetics/radiation effects', 'Mice', 'Radiation, Ionizing', 'Tandem Repeat Sequences/genetics']",1999/01/09 00:00,1999/01/09 00:01,['1999/01/09 00:00'],"['1999/01/09 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/01/09 00:01 [medline]', '1999/01/09 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/095530098140989 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Radiat Biol. 1998 Dec;74(6):711-20. doi: 10.1080/095530098140989.,,,,69,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The steady-state level of nucleophosmin/B23 mRNA and the total cellular nucleophosmin/B23 protein decreased during the BuONa/vanadate-induced apoptosis. Stabilization and promotor transcriptional activity assays indicate that the decrease in nucleophosmin/B23 mRNA in BuONa/vanadate-treated HL-60 cells was transcriptionally regulated. A decline in telomerase activity was observed in HL-60 cells treated with BuONa/vanadate for 24-96 h. There was virtually no decline of nucleophosmin/B23 mRNA nor the telomerase activities during the growth arrest by serum-starvation. The decrease in nucleophosmin/B23 mRNA expression and telomerase activity in HL-60 cells subsequent to BuONa/vanadate treatment can thus be attributed to cellular apoptosis rather than the growth arrest induced by BuONa/vanadate. Nucleophosmin/B23 antisense oligomer treatment significantly potentiated BuONa-induced apoptosis and inhibition of telomerase activity. Results of this study suggest that nucleophosmin/B23 is one of the key elements in the down-regulation of nucleolar function for cellular apoptosis and mortalization.","['Liu, W H', 'Yung, B Y']","['Liu WH', 'Yung BY']","['Department of Pharmacology, College of Medicine, Chang Gung University, Taiwan, Republic of China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (Butyrates)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (NPM1 protein, human)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Oligonucleotides, Antisense)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '117896-08-9 (Nucleophosmin)', '3WHH0066W5 (Vanadates)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (Telomerase)']",IM,"['*Apoptosis', 'Butyrates/pharmacology', 'Cell Division/drug effects', '*Down-Regulation', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Gene Expression Regulation/drug effects', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', '*Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute', 'Nuclear Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Nucleophosmin', 'Oligonucleotides, Antisense', 'RNA, Messenger', 'Telomerase/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Vanadates/pharmacology']",1999/01/09 00:00,1999/01/09 00:01,['1999/01/09 00:00'],"['1999/01/09 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/01/09 00:01 [medline]', '1999/01/09 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.onc.1202234 [doi]'],ppublish,Oncogene. 1998 Dec 10;17(23):3055-64. doi: 10.1038/sj.onc.1202234.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It has been proposed by others, that these translocations are mediated by recombinases of the immune system. The breakpoints on both derivative chromosomes for three t(4;11) leukemia-derived cell lines and primary blasts from two patients have been analysed here in detail. The results revealed that: (a) multiple double- or single-stranded DNA breaks must have occured near the translocation breakpoints on both participating chromosomes; and (b) DNA fragments flanked by these breaks must have either been deleted, inverted or duplicated during the translocation process. We found no evidence for the involvement of specific target sequences and recombinases of the immune system. Similar characteristic features were observed by re-interpretation of published t(6;11) and t(9;22) translocation data. Therefore we present a new model for the generation of these translocations which poses, that these translocations are reciprocal but not balanced at the fine structure level and that the DNA damage-repair machinery is likely involved in producing the final structure of the translocation breakpoint.","['Reichel, M', 'Gillert, E', 'Nilson, I', 'Siegler, G', 'Greil, J', 'Fey, G H', 'Marschalek, R']","['Reichel M', 'Gillert E', 'Nilson I', 'Siegler G', 'Greil J', 'Fey GH', 'Marschalek R']","['Genetics, University of Erlangen-Nurnberg, Erlangen, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Transcriptional Elongation Factors)', '150826-18-9 (AFF1 protein, human)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 11', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 22', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 4', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 6', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 9', '*DNA Damage', '*DNA Repair', '*DNA, Neoplasm', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics', 'Exons', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*genetics', 'Models, Genetic', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Nuclear Proteins/*genetics', 'Recombination, Genetic', 'Transcriptional Elongation Factors', '*Translocation, Genetic', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1999/01/09 00:00,1999/01/09 00:01,['1999/01/09 00:00'],"['1999/01/09 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/01/09 00:01 [medline]', '1999/01/09 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.onc.1202229 [doi]'],ppublish,Oncogene. 1998 Dec 10;17(23):3035-44. doi: 10.1038/sj.onc.1202229.,,,,,,,"['GENBANK/Y16596', 'GENBANK/Y16597', 'GENBANK/Y16598', 'GENBANK/Y16599', 'GENBANK/Y16600', 'GENBANK/Y16601', 'GENBANK/Y16602', 'GENBANK/Y16603', 'GENBANK/Y16604', 'GENBANK/Y16605', 'GENBANK/Y16606', 'GENBANK/Y16607', 'GENBANK/Y16608', 'GENBANK/Y16609']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Hypercalcemia resulting from osteoclast activation and a variety of hematopoietic abnormalities have been also observed in HTLV-I infected patients, however, precise mechanism about initial trigger(s) prior to presenting symptoms is still unknown. In this study, to assess effects of HTLV-I on hematopoiesis, we analysed characteristics of early hematopoietic precursors in HTLV-I env-pX transgenic rats. Progenitor cells for osteoclasts were significantly increased even in the marrow of asymptomatic env-pX rats. Progenitors for B cells were also highly enriched, while colony forming cells (CFC) elicited by GM-CSF(CFU-GM) and M-CSF(CFU-M) were comparable to normal littermates. Following arthritis in env-pX transgenic rats, osteoclastogenesis was further augmented and the CFCs were increased. Bone marrow cells carrying adjuvant-induced arthritis retained a constant number of progenitors for osteoclast and B lymphocytes, whereas the number of CFU-GM and CFU-M increased. These results indicate that the env-pX transgene affect early stages of osteoclast and B-cell lineages prior to developing diseases, in contrast, an increase of the CFCs was caused indirectly by arthritis. This study provides a novel standpoint for the mechanisms of pathogenesis by HTLV-I.","['Yamazaki, H', 'Kunisada, T', 'Ishizu, A', 'Ikeda, H', 'Miyoshi, I', 'Sudo, T', 'Hayashi, S I', 'Yoshiki, T']","['Yamazaki H', 'Kunisada T', 'Ishizu A', 'Ikeda H', 'Miyoshi I', 'Sudo T', 'Hayashi SI', 'Yoshiki T']","['Department of Immunology, School of Life Science, Faculty of Medicine, Tottori University, Yonago, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (Retroviridae Proteins, Oncogenic)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)', '0 (Viral Regulatory and Accessory Proteins)', '0 (pX protein, Human T-lymphotropic virus 1)', ""9007-81-2 (Freund's Adjuvant)""]",IM,"['Animals', 'Animals, Genetically Modified', 'Arthritis, Experimental', 'B-Lymphocytes/*cytology', 'Bone Marrow Cells/*cytology', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cells, Cultured', ""Freund's Adjuvant/pharmacology"", 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology', 'Humans', '*Leukopoiesis', 'Male', 'Osteoblasts/*cytology', 'Rats', 'Rats, Inbred Lew', 'Rats, Wistar', 'Retroviridae Proteins, Oncogenic/genetics/*metabolism', '*Transcription Factors', 'Viral Envelope Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Viral Regulatory and Accessory Proteins']",1999/01/09 00:00,1999/01/09 00:01,['1999/01/09 00:00'],"['1999/01/09 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/01/09 00:01 [medline]', '1999/01/09 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.onc.1202222 [doi]'],ppublish,Oncogene. 1998 Dec 10;17(23):2955-60. doi: 10.1038/sj.onc.1202222.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The extension of the neurite outgrowth was dependent on the culture time of RBL-2H3 cells in the DMEM medium. The DMEM medium conditioned by RBL-2H3 cells for 48 h induced neurite outgrowth of PC12 cells significantly. The neurite extension was much higher than that by medium containing 1 ng/ml nerve growth factor (NGF) but was rather lower than that by medium containing 10 or 50 ng/ml NGF. The neurite extension by 50 ng/ml NGF was completely suppressed by excess anti-NGF antibody (1-1.5 microg/ml), while the extension by culture medium conditioned by RBL-2H3 cells for 48 h was not completely suppressed in the presence of the same amount of anti-NGF antibody. The neurite extension by the culture medium of RBL-2H3 cells was also suppressed by anti-interleukin (IL)-6 antibody (1 microg/ml), although IL-6 itself (20 units) could scarcely induce the neurite outgrowth of PC12 cells. This suggests that IL-6 in the culture medium of RBL-2H3 cells could be effective in inducing the neurite extension in cooperation with NGF. In the presence of an excess of both anti-NGF and anti-IL-6 antibodies, the culture medium of RBL-2H3 cells induced the neurite extension of PC12 cells. This suggests that the action of the various factors from RBL-2H3 cells may be synergistic as far as the neurite outgrowth of PC12 cells is concerned.","['Suzuki, M', 'Furuno, T', 'Teshima, R', 'Sawada, J', 'Nakanishi, M']","['Suzuki M', 'Furuno T', 'Teshima R', 'Sawada J', 'Nakanishi M']","['Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Nagoya City University, Nagoya, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Japan,Biol Pharm Bull,Biological & pharmaceutical bulletin,9311984,"['0 (Culture Media, Conditioned)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Nerve Growth Factors)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Communication', 'Cell Differentiation/physiology', 'Culture Media, Conditioned', 'Interleukin-6/physiology', 'Leukemia, Basophilic, Acute', 'Mast Cells/*physiology', 'Nerve Growth Factors/physiology', 'Neurites/physiology', 'Neurons/cytology/*physiology', 'PC12 Cells', 'Rats', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1999/01/09 00:00,1999/01/09 00:01,['1999/01/09 00:00'],"['1999/01/09 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/01/09 00:01 [medline]', '1999/01/09 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1248/bpb.21.1267 [doi]'],ppublish,Biol Pharm Bull. 1998 Dec;21(12):1267-70. doi: 10.1248/bpb.21.1267.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The productions of free arachidonic acid and PGD2 in RBL-2H3 cells were enhanced considerably by exposure to tert-butyl hydroperoxide (t-BHP). The liberation of arachidonic acid induced by t-BHP was not inhibited by EGTA. The productions of PGD2 and arachidonic acid induced by t-BHP were significantly facilitated by the depletion of intracellular GSH using buthionine sulfoximine (BSO) or diethyl maleate (DEM), although the depletion of GSH had no effect on the production of PGD2 induced by A23187. t-BHP failed to activate the conversion of free arachidonic acid to PGD2, since the formation of PGD2 from exogenously added arachidonic acid was not enhanced by treatment with t-BHP. The level of lipid hydroperoxides in t-BHP-treated cells was significantly elevated by treatment with DEM. These results suggest that hydroperoxides increase the free arachidonic acid available for the synthesis of PGD2 by activating phospholipase A2 (PLA2) and that the depletion of GSH by DEM accelerates the activation of PLA2 by raising peroxide levels in cells. Thus, the observed alterations in GSH levels are large enough to cause increased PGD2 synthesis in RBL-2H3 cells exposed to oxidative stress.","['Sakamoto, H', 'Kitahara, J', 'Nakagawa, Y']","['Sakamoto H', 'Kitahara J', 'Nakagawa Y']","['School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Kitasato University, Minato-ku, Tokyo, 108-8641, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,J Biochem,Journal of biochemistry,0376600,"['0 (Ionophores)', '0 (Isoenzymes)', '0 (Lipocalins)', '0 (Maleates)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Oxidants)', '0 (Phospholipids)', '27YG812J1I (Arachidonic Acid)', '37H9VM9WZL (Calcimycin)', '5072-26-4 (Buthionine Sulfoximine)', '955VYL842B (tert-Butylhydroperoxide)', 'EC 1.14.99.1 (Cyclooxygenase 1)', 'EC 1.14.99.1 (Prostaglandin-Endoperoxide Synthases)', 'EC 1.14.99.1 (Ptgs1 protein, rat)', 'EC 5.3.- (Intramolecular Oxidoreductases)', 'EC 5.3.99.2 (prostaglandin R2 D-isomerase)', 'G81WQB56OL (diethyl maleate)', 'GAN16C9B8O (Glutathione)', 'RXY07S6CZ2 (Prostaglandin D2)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Arachidonic Acid/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Buthionine Sulfoximine/pharmacology', 'Calcimycin/pharmacology', 'Cyclooxygenase 1', 'Glutathione/*metabolism', 'Intramolecular Oxidoreductases/metabolism', 'Ionophores/pharmacology', 'Isoenzymes/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Experimental/drug therapy/*metabolism', 'Lipocalins', 'Maleates/pharmacology', 'Membrane Proteins', 'Oxidants/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Oxidation-Reduction', 'Phospholipids/chemistry/metabolism', 'Prostaglandin D2/*biosynthesis', 'Prostaglandin-Endoperoxide Synthases/metabolism', 'Rats', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'tert-Butylhydroperoxide/*metabolism/pharmacology']",1999/01/09 00:00,1999/01/09 00:01,['1999/01/09 00:00'],"['1999/01/09 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/01/09 00:01 [medline]', '1999/01/09 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/oxfordjournals.jbchem.a022274 [doi]'],ppublish,J Biochem. 1999 Jan;125(1):90-5. doi: 10.1093/oxfordjournals.jbchem.a022274.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The most characteristic features of the effect of beta-HIVS were the remarkable morphological changes induced upon treatment of HL-60 cells with beta-HIVS, as visualized on the staining of actin filaments with phalloidin labeled with tetramethylrhodamine B isothiocyanate. Moreover, activation of MAP kinases, such as ERK2, JNK and p38, was detected after treatment with 10(-6) M beta-HIVS preceding the appearance of the characteristics of apoptosis, and the features of the activation of these MAP kinases were quite different from those of Fas and anticancer drug-induced apoptosis. The activation of JNK by beta-HIVS was not inhibited by inhibitors of caspases, suggesting that JNK is located either upstream or independent of the caspase signaling pathway. beta-HIVS did not inhibit the activity of topoisomerase II.

The nucleotide sequence of Fv1 bears similarity to the gag of a human endogenous retrovirus, HERV-L, but is more closely related to the gag-coding sequence of a newly described class of HERV-L-related mouse endogenous retroviruses designated MuERV-L. Both observations suggest an origin of Fv1 from endogenous gag sequences. The molecular definition of Fv1 provided an opportunity to determine the phylogeny of the gene among wild mice and its relation to MuERV-L. PCR primers, chosen to include most of the coding region of Fv1 for both the n and b alleles, were used to amplify sequences from animals of the genus Mus, which were then sequenced. Closely related products were obtained from almost all animals examined that evolved after the separation from Rattus, in which the homologous gene was shown to be absent. A phylogenetic tree generated with Fv1 sequence data differs noticeably from that developed with sequence data from other genes. In addition, non-synonymous changes were found to be present twice as frequently as synonymous changes, a fact that departs from the standard behavior of a structural gene.

A 162-base pair segment of the human MCL1 5'-flank was found to direct luciferase reporter activity, allowing approximately 10-fold induction with TPA that was suppressible upon inhibition of the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) pathway. Serum response factor (SRF), Elk-1, and Sp1 bound to cognate sites within this segment, SRF and Elk-1 acting coordinately to affect both basal activity and TPA inducibility, whereas Sp1 affected basal activity only. Thus, the mechanism of the TPA-induced increase in MCL1 expression seen in myelomonocytic cells at early stages of differentiation involves signal transduction through ERKs and transcriptional activation through SRF/Elk-1. This finding provides a parallel to early response genes (e.g. c-FOS and EGR1) that affect maturation commitment in these cells and therefore suggests a means through which enhancement of cell viability may be linked to the induction of differentiation.","['Townsend, K J', 'Zhou, P', 'Qian, L', 'Bieszczad, C K', 'Lowrey, C H', 'Yen, A', 'Craig, R W']","['Townsend KJ', 'Zhou P', 'Qian L', 'Bieszczad CK', 'Lowrey CH', 'Yen A', 'Craig RW']","['Departments of Pharmacology and Toxicology, Dartmouth Medical School, Hanover, New Hampshire 03755-3835, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (ELK1 protein, human)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Flavonoids)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Serum Response Factor)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (ets-Domain Protein Elk-1)', 'EC 2.7.11.17 (Calcium-Calmodulin-Dependent Protein Kinases)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)', 'SJE1IO5E3I (2-(2-amino-3-methoxyphenyl)-4H-1-benzopyran-4-one)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Calcium-Calmodulin-Dependent Protein Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Cell Differentiation', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*metabolism', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Flavonoids/pharmacology', 'Gene Expression Regulation/drug effects', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*cytology', 'Humans', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Neoplasm Proteins/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Nuclear Proteins/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Serum Response Factor', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Transcription Factors/*metabolism', 'Transcriptional Activation/drug effects', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Up-Regulation', 'ets-Domain Protein Elk-1']",1999/01/09 00:00,1999/01/09 00:01,['1999/01/09 00:00'],"['1999/01/09 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/01/09 00:01 [medline]', '1999/01/09 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1074/jbc.274.3.1801 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(19)88300-X [pii]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1999 Jan 15;274(3):1801-13. doi: 10.1074/jbc.274.3.1801.,"['R01 CA057359/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA57359/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, we further characterize the detergent sensitivity of this association on rat basophilic leukemia-2H3 mast cells, and we compare the capacity of structural variants of FcepsilonRI and other receptors to undergo this association. We show that this interaction is not mediated by the beta subunit of the receptor or the cytoplasmic tail of the gamma subunit, both of which are involved in signaling. Using chimeric receptor constructs, we found that the extracellular segment of the FcepsilonRI alpha subunit was not sufficient to mediate this association, implicating FcepsilonRI alpha and/or gamma transmembrane segments. To determine the specificity of this interaction, we compared the association of several other receptors. Interleukin-1 type I receptors on Chinese hamster ovary cells and alpha4 integrins on rat basophilic leukemia cells showed little or no association with isolated membrane domains, both before and after aggregation on the cells. In contrast, interleukin-2 receptor alpha (Tac) on Chinese hamster ovary cells exhibited aggregation-dependent membrane domain association similar to FcepsilonRI.

However, despite its potential importance, the signals regulating mutant p53 protein expression are not known. Here we show that a form of p53 that is incapable of binding DNA is overexpressed in the acute promyelocytic leukemia NB4 cell line. Our results demonstrate that treatment of NB4 cells with bryostatin-1, which induces differentiation in this cell line, leads to hyperphosphorylation of this DNA binding-impaired form of p53 via mitogen-activated protein kinase. After this phosphorylation, the p53 protein is degraded by the ubiquitin/proteasome pathway. Furthermore, we show that inhibition of p53 hyperphosphorylation blocks p53 protein degradation and cell differentiation. In addition, inhibition of the ubiquitin/proteasome pathway also blocks p53 protein degradation and cell differentiation. These findings suggest a role for mitogen-activated protein kinase in the degradation of the DNA binding-impaired form of p53 protein and in the bryostatin-induced differentiation observed in this cell line.

Mutations in the btk gene have been linked to severe developmental blocks in human B-cell ontogeny leading to X-linked agammaglobulinemia. Here, we provide unique biochemical and genetic evidence that BTK is an inhibitor of the Fas/APO-1 death-inducing signaling complex in B-lineage lymphoid cells. The Src homology 2, pleckstrin homology (PH), and kinase domains of BTK are all individually important and apparently indispensable, but not sufficient, for its function as a negative regulator of Fas-mediated apoptosis. BTK associates with Fas via its kinase and PH domains and prevents the FAS-FADD interaction, which is essential for the recruitment and activation of FLICE by Fas during the apoptotic signal. Fas-resistant DT-40 lymphoma B-cells rendered BTK-deficient through targeted disruption of the btk gene by homologous recombination knockout underwent apoptosis after Fas ligation, but wild-type DT-40 cells or BTK-deficient DT-40 cells reconstituted with wild-type human btk gene did not. Introduction of an Src homology 2 domain, a PH domain, or a kinase domain mutant human btk gene into BTK-deficient cells did not restore the resistance to Fas-mediated apoptosis. Introduction of wild-type BTK protein by electroporation rendered BTK-deficient DT-40 cells resistant to the apoptotic effects of Fas ligation. BTK-deficient RAMOS-1 human Burkitt's leukemia cells underwent apoptosis after Fas ligation, whereas BTK-positive NALM-6-UM1 human B-cell precursor leukemia cells expressing similar levels of Fas did not. Treatment of the anti-Fas-resistant NALM-6-UM1 cells with the leflunomide metabolite analog alpha-cyano-beta-methyl-beta-hydroxy-N-(2, 5-dibromophenyl)propenamide, a potent inhibitor of BTK, abrogated the BTK-Fas association without affecting the expression levels of BTK or Fas and rendered them sensitive to Fas-mediated apoptosis. The ability of BTK to inhibit the pro-apoptotic effects of Fas ligation prompts the hypothesis that apoptosis of developing B-cell precursors during normal B-cell ontogeny may be reciprocally regulated by Fas and BTK.","['Vassilev, A', 'Ozer, Z', 'Navara, C', 'Mahajan, S', 'Uckun, F M']","['Vassilev A', 'Ozer Z', 'Navara C', 'Mahajan S', 'Uckun FM']","['Parker Hughes Cancer Center, Molecular Signal Transduction Laboratory, Departments of Immunology, Molecular Biology, and Biochemistry, Hughes Institute, St. Paul, Minnesota 55113, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Arabidopsis Proteins)', '0 (Blood Proteins)', '0 (CASP8 and FADD-Like Apoptosis Regulating Protein)', '0 (CFLAR protein, human)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Phosphoproteins)', '0 (Plant Proteins)', '0 (fas Receptor)', '0 (platelet protein P47)', 'EC 1.14.19.- (Fatty Acid Desaturases)', 'EC 1.14.99.- (Fad7 protein, Arabidopsis)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Agammaglobulinaemia Tyrosine Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (BTK protein, human)']",IM,"['Agammaglobulinaemia Tyrosine Kinase', '*Arabidopsis Proteins', 'B-Lymphocytes/enzymology/*physiology', 'Blood Proteins/chemistry', 'CASP8 and FADD-Like Apoptosis Regulating Protein', 'Carrier Proteins/metabolism', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Fatty Acid Desaturases/metabolism', 'Humans', '*Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins', 'Microscopy, Confocal', '*Phosphoproteins', 'Plant Proteins/metabolism', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', '*Sequence Homology, Amino Acid', '*Signal Transduction', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'fas Receptor/*physiology']",1999/01/09 00:00,1999/01/09 00:01,['1999/01/09 00:00'],"['1999/01/09 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/01/09 00:01 [medline]', '1999/01/09 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1074/jbc.274.3.1646 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(19)88281-9 [pii]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1999 Jan 15;274(3):1646-56. doi: 10.1074/jbc.274.3.1646.,['U01-CA-72157/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this report, we show that SCL interacts with p44, a subunit of the basal transcription factor TFIIH. The minimal region of SCL that interacts with p44 was mapped to a 101-amino acid sequence that includes, but is not limited to, the bHLH region; the SCL-binding site of p44 is located in the carboxyl-terminal half of p44. This interaction was confirmed by glutathione S-transferase fusion protein pull-down assays and a co-immunoprecipitation assay. As analyzed with a yeast two-hybrid system, p44 interacts specifically with SCL, but not with the other class A or B bHLH proteins tested. E2A did not compete with p44 for SCL binding, as demonstrated by an in vitro binding assay.

We aimed to distinguish the features in these patients that lead to the correct diagnosis of malignancy. STUDY DESIGN: A retrospective review of the case records of 29 children (19 boys and 10 girls, aged 1 to 15.5 years) with malignancy who were referred to 2 pediatric rheumatology centers between 1983 and 1997. RESULTS: The suspected diagnoses on referral were: juvenile rheumatoid arthritis (12), nonspecific connective tissue disease (4), discitis (3), spondyloarthropathy (3), systemic lupus erythematosus (2), Kawasaki disease (2), Lyme disease (1), mixed connective tissue disease (1), and dermatomyositis (1). The final diagnoses were leukemia (13), neuroblastoma (6), lymphoma (3), Ewing's sarcoma (3), ependymoma (1), thalamic glioma (1), epithelioma (1), and sarcoma (1). Patients had features typical of many rheumatic disorders including musculoskeletal pains (82%), fever (54%), fatigue (50%), weight loss (42%), hepatomegaly (29%), and arthritis (25%). Features that were suggestive of malignancy included nonarticular ""bone"" pain (68%), back pain as a major presenting feature (32%), bone tenderness (29%), severe constitutional symptoms (32%), clinical features ""atypical"" of most rheumatic disease (48%), and abnormal initial investigations (68%). The atypical features included night sweats (14%), ecchymoses and bruising (14%), abnormal neurologic signs (10%), abnormal masses (7%), and ptosis (3%). Initial investigations with abnormal findings included complete blood count/smear (31%), discordant erythrocyte sedimentation rate and platelet count (28%), elevated lactate dehydrognease level (24%), plain skeletal x-ray films (28%), bone scan (21%), and abdominal ultrasonography (17%). Findings of investigations done before referral to the rheumatology clinic were not recognized as abnormal in 11 (40%) patients. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with a diverse group of malignancies, other than leukemia, may present to the pediatric rheumatologist. Pediatric care providers should be familiar with typical features of childhood rheumatic disorders, and rheumatic diagnoses should be reevaluated in the presence of any atypical or discordant clinical features.","['Cabral, D A', 'Tucker, L B']","['Cabral DA', 'Tucker LB']","[""Division of Pediatric Rheumatology, Department of Pediatrics, BC Children's Hospital, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Pediatr,The Journal of pediatrics,0375410,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', '*Diagnostic Errors', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/*diagnosis/physiopathology', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Rheumatic Diseases/*diagnosis/physiopathology']",1999/01/08 00:00,1999/01/08 00:01,['1999/01/08 00:00'],"['1999/01/08 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/01/08 00:01 [medline]', '1999/01/08 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0022-3476(99)70372-0 [pii]', '10.1016/s0022-3476(99)70372-0 [doi]']",ppublish,J Pediatr. 1999 Jan;134(1):53-7. doi: 10.1016/s0022-3476(99)70372-0.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Previously, we reported that induction of the cellular stress response enhanced HTLV-I-mediated syncytia formation following induction of the cellular stress response in persistently infected lymphocytes. In this study, we show that the increase in HTLV-I-mediated syncytia formation following stress response induction is a result of increased cell surface expression of viral Env protein (gp46). Cellular stress in MT 2.6 cells did not alter the turnover of intracellular Env protein (gp68) as no changes in viral protein half-life were demonstrated as compared to non-stressed cells. However, Env expression in stressed cells treated with a protein synthesis inhibitor (cycloheximide) indicates the effect is mediated through increased translation of viral Env protein.","['Andrews, J M', 'Oglesbee, M', 'Lairmore, M D']","['Andrews JM', 'Oglesbee M', 'Lairmore MD']","['Center for Retrovirus Research and Department of Veterinary Biosciences, The Ohio State University, Columbus 43210, USA. jan_andrews@ncsu.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,J Gen Virol,The Journal of general virology,0077340,"['0 (Gene Products, env)', '0 (HSP72 Heat-Shock Proteins)', '0 (Heat-Shock Proteins)', '0 (Protein Precursors)', '0 (Retroviridae Proteins, Oncogenic)', '0 (gp46 protein, Human T-cell leukemia virus type I)']",IM,"['Cell Line, Transformed', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Products, env/*biosynthesis', 'HSP72 Heat-Shock Proteins', 'Heat-Shock Proteins/biosynthesis', '*Heat-Shock Response', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*metabolism/physiology', 'Humans', 'Protein Precursors/biosynthesis', 'Retroviridae Proteins, Oncogenic/*biosynthesis']",1999/01/08 00:00,1999/01/08 00:01,['1999/01/08 00:00'],"['1999/01/08 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/01/08 00:01 [medline]', '1999/01/08 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1099/0022-1317-79-12-2905 [doi]'],ppublish,J Gen Virol. 1998 Dec;79 ( Pt 12):2905-8. doi: 10.1099/0022-1317-79-12-2905.,"['CA55185/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'K11 AI01190/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA16058/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Their effects on cell growth, polyamine oxidase (PAO) activity and intracellular polyamine content were determined. The cytotoxicity tests were performed in culture medium supplemented with 100 micromol/L aminoguanidine (I), 100 micromol/L aminoguanidine and 100 micromol/L N,N'-bis(2,3-butadienyl)-1,4-butanediamine (MDL 72,527) (II), and finally 100 micromol/L aminoguanidine and 200 micromol/L D,L-difluoromethylornithine (DFMO) (III). The IC50 values under conditions I and III were similar, suggesting that inhibition of ornithine decarboxylase by DFMO did not affect the biological effect of our derivatives. Spermine and spermidine remained nontoxic in conditions I and III. However in the condition II, the toxicity of all tested compounds (excepted spermidine) was increased, suggesting that the inhibition of cellular PAO increased their toxicity. The enzymatic test of PAO showed that at high doses inhibition of this enzyme by putrescine analogs occurred, while the N-methylated propanediamine derivative increased the enzyme activity; however, these results do not correlate with cytotoxicity tests. When these derivatives were incubated for 48 h with the cells, all of them increased the cell content in putrescine (approximately 160%) and spermine (approximately 145%) and decreased the spermidine content (approximately 75%) without any modification of the total amount of polyamine. The correlation between the cytotoxic results and the intracellular polyamine determination shows that the increase in spermine content along with the inhibition of retroconverting PAO enzyme increases the toxic effect of tested compounds (including spermine), suggesting that spermine toxicity is more important in the absence of intracellular oxidation processes.","['Badolo, L', 'Hanocq, M', 'Dubois, J']","['Badolo L', 'Hanocq M', 'Dubois J']","['Laboratoire de Chimie Bioanalytique, de Toxicologie et de Chimie Physique Appliquee, Institut de Pharmacie, Universite Libre de Bruxelles, Belgium.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Cell Biol Toxicol,Cell biology and toxicology,8506639,"['0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Ornithine Decarboxylase Inhibitors)', '0 (Polyamines)', '0 (Propylamines)', 'EC 1.5.- (Oxidoreductases Acting on CH-NH Group Donors)', 'EC 1.5.3.- (polyamine oxidase)', 'EC 4.1.1.17 (Ornithine Decarboxylase)', 'V10TVZ52E4 (Putrescine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Leukemia P388/enzymology/*metabolism/pathology', 'Mice', 'Ornithine Decarboxylase/metabolism', 'Ornithine Decarboxylase Inhibitors', 'Oxidoreductases Acting on CH-NH Group Donors/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Polyamines/*metabolism', 'Propylamines/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Putrescine/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1999/01/08 00:00,1999/01/08 00:01,['1999/01/08 00:00'],"['1999/01/08 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/01/08 00:01 [medline]', '1999/01/08 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1023/a:1007503928993 [doi]'],ppublish,Cell Biol Toxicol. 1998 Dec;14(6):419-28. doi: 10.1023/a:1007503928993.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Myeloid and other hematopoietic cell lineages are involved in the process of clonal proliferation and differentiation. After a period of 4-6 years the disease progresses to acute-stage leukemia. On the cellular level, CML is associated with a specific chromosome abnormality, the t(9; 22) reciprocal translocation that forms the Philadelphia (Ph) chromosome. The Ph chromosome is the result of a molecular rearrangement between the c-ABL proto-oncogene on chromosome 9 and the BCR (breakpoint cluster region) gene on chromosome 22. Most of ABL is linked with a truncated BCR. The BCR/ABL fusion gene codes for an 8-kb mRNA and a novel 210-kDa protein which has higher and aberrant tyrosine kinase activity than the normal c-ABL-coded counterpart. Phosphorylation of a number of substrates such as GAP, GRB-2, SHC, FES, CRKL, and paxillin is considered a decisive step in transformation. An etiological connection between BCR/ABL and leukemia is indicated by the observation that transgenic mice bearing a BCR/ABL DNA construct develop leukemia of B, T, and myeloid cell origin. CML cells proliferate and expand in an almost unlimited manner. Adhesion defects in bone marrow stromal cells have been proposed to explain the increased number of leukemic cells in the peripheral blood. However, findings of our laboratory have shown that the BCR/ABL chimeric protein that is expressed in transfected cells may, under certain conditions, also increase the adhesion to fibronectin via enhanced expression of integrin. Our previous immunocytological studies on the expression of beta1 and beta2 integrins have found no qualitative differences between normal and CML hematopoietic cells in vitro. Even long-term-cultured CML bone marrow or blood cells continuously express those adhesion molecules that are characteristic of the cytological type. Recent experiments indicate that certain early CML progenitors may adhere to the stromal layer in vitro similarly to their normal counterparts. They cannot be completely removed by long-term culture on allogeneic stromal cells. At present, the only curative therapy is transplantation of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cells. Based on the molecular and cellular state of knowledge of CML, new therapies are being developed. BCR/ABL antisense oligonucleotides, inhibitors of tyrosine kinase, peptide-specific adoptive immunotherapy or peptide vaccination, and restoration of hematopoiesis by autologous stem cell transplantation following CML cell purging are examples of important approaches to improving CML treatment.","['Pasternak, G', 'Hochhaus, A', 'Schultheis, B', 'Hehlmann, R']","['Pasternak G', 'Hochhaus A', 'Schultheis B', 'Hehlmann R']","['III.

Normally, fusion between an infected cell and uninfected cells (heterofusions) is described, but we have surprisingly found that the infected cells also caused homofusion between uninfected cells in their vicinity (named neighbor homofusions). It was shown that neighbor homofusions were not induced by free virus particles (by FFWO). Transfectants expressing envelope proteins only induced heterofusions, indicating that virus production is necessary for the formation of neighbor homofusions. Both plasma membrane fragments and easily removable material from the surface of infected cells were able to induce fusion with the same stimulation pattern as FFWI and neighbor homofusion.

Tea is processed differently in different parts of the world to give green (20%), black (78%) or oolong tea (2%). Green tea is consumed mostly in Japan and China. The antimutagenic and anticarcinogenic activities of green tea are extensively examined. The chemical components of green and black tea are polyphenols, which include EC, ECG, EGC, EGCG and TFs. This article reviews the epidemiological and experimental studies on the antimutagenicity and anticarcinogenicity of tea extracts and tea polyphenols. In Japan, an epidemiological study showed an inverse relationship between habitual green tea drinking and the standardized mortality rates for cancer. Some cohort studies on Chanoyu (Japanese tea ceremony) women teachers also showed that their mortality ratio including deaths caused by malignant neoplasms were surprisingly low. The antimutagenic activity against various mutagens of tea extracts and polyphenols including ECG and EGCG has been demonstrated in microbial systems (Salmonella typhimurium and Escherichia coli), mammalian cell systems and in vivo animal tests. The anticarcinogenic activity of tea phenols has been shown in experimental animals such as rats and mice, in transplantable tumors, carcinogen-induced tumors in digestive organs, mammary glands, hepatocarcinomas, lung cancers, skin tumors, leukemia, tumor promotion and metastasis. The mechanisms of antimutagenesis and anticarcinogenesis of tea polyphenols suggest that the inhibition of tumors may be due to both extracellular and intracellular mechanisms including the modulation of metabolism, blocking or suppression, modulation of DNA replication and repair effects, promotion, inhibition of invasion and metastasis, and induction of novel mechanisms.","['Kuroda, Y', 'Hara, Y']","['Kuroda Y', 'Hara Y']","['National Institute of Genetics, Mishima, Shizuoka 411-8540, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Netherlands,Mutat Res,Mutation research,0400763,"['0 (Anticarcinogenic Agents)', '0 (Antimutagenic Agents)', '0 (Flavonoids)', '0 (Phenols)', '0 (Polymers)', '0 (Polyphenols)', '0 (Tea)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Anticarcinogenic Agents/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Antimutagenic Agents/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Carcinogenicity Tests', 'Enterobacteriaceae/genetics', 'Female', '*Flavonoids', 'Humans', 'Japan', 'Mutagenicity Tests', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Neoplasms/epidemiology/genetics/mortality/*prevention & control', 'Phenols/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Polymers/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Polyphenols', '*Tea']",1999/01/08 00:00,1999/01/08 00:01,['1999/01/08 00:00'],"['1999/01/08 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/01/08 00:01 [medline]', '1999/01/08 00:00 [entrez]']","['S1383-5742(98)00019-2 [pii]', '10.1016/s1383-5742(98)00019-2 [doi]']",ppublish,Mutat Res. 1999 Jan;436(1):69-97. doi: 10.1016/s1383-5742(98)00019-2.,,,,131,,['Copyright 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The frequency range 100 Hz-10 MHz and medium conductivities of 10 mS/m, 30 mS/m and 56 mS/m were studied for fields generated by applying signals of up to 7V peak to peak (p-p) to a parallel electrode array having equal electrode widths and gaps of 100 micrometer. Between 1 kHz and 10 MHz, cell viability after up to 40 min of field exposure was found to be above 95% and cells were able to proliferate. However, cell growth lag phase was extended with decreasing field frequency and with increasing voltage, medium conductivity and exposure duration. Modified growth behavior was not passed on to the next cell passage, indicating that field exposure did not cause permanent alterations in cell proliferation characteristics. Cell membrane potentials induced by field exposure were calculated and shown to be well below values typically associated with cell damage. Furthermore, medium treated by field exposure and then added to untreated cells produced the same modifications of growth as exposing cells directly, and these modifications occurred only when the electrode polarization voltage exceeded a threshold of approximately 0.4 V p-p. These findings suggested that electrochemical products generated during field exposure were responsible for the changes in cell growth. Finally, it was found that hydrogen peroxide was produced when sugar-containing media were exposed to fields and that normal cell growth could be restored by addition of catalase to the medium, whether or not field exposure occurred in the presence of cells. These results show that AC fields typically used for dielectrophoretic manipulation and sorting of cells do not damage DS19 cells and that cell alterations arising from electrochemical effects can be completely mitigated.","['Wang, X', 'Yang, J', 'Gascoyne, P R']","['Wang X', 'Yang J', 'Gascoyne PR']","['Department of Molecular Pathology, University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, 1515 Holcombe Boulevard, Houston, TX 77030, USA. xujing@solace.mdacc.tmc.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Netherlands,Biochim Biophys Acta,Biochimica et biophysica acta,0217513,"['0 (Culture Media)', '57-50-1 (Sucrose)', 'BBX060AN9V (Hydrogen Peroxide)', 'EC 1.11.1.6 (Catalase)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Catalase', 'Cell Division/radiation effects', 'Cell Survival', 'Culture Media/radiation effects', 'Electrochemistry', '*Electromagnetic Fields', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Hydrogen Peroxide/*analysis', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute', 'Membrane Potentials', 'Mice', 'Sucrose', 'Temperature', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/chemistry/metabolism/*radiation effects']",1999/01/08 00:00,1999/01/08 00:01,['1999/01/08 00:00'],"['1999/01/08 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/01/08 00:01 [medline]', '1999/01/08 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0304-4165(98)00122-6 [pii]', '10.1016/s0304-4165(98)00122-6 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochim Biophys Acta. 1999 Jan 4;1426(1):53-68. doi: 10.1016/s0304-4165(98)00122-6.,"['R01 DK051065/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 DK051065-04/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'R01DK51065-01/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States']",,PMC2726262,,,,,,['NIHMS106115'],,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, we report the molecular cloning of a novel adaptor-like protein, Grap-2 (Grb-2 related adaptor protein 2), using the multisubstrate docking protein Gab-1 as bait in the yeast two-hybrid system. Sequence analysis revealed that Grap-2 contains a SH3-SH2-SH3 structure that has a high degree of sequence homology to those of the Grb-2 and Grap adaptor molecules. However, unlike in Grap and Grb-2, the SH2 and the C-terminal SH3 domains of Grap-2 are separated by a 120-amino-acid glutamine-rich sequence that shows no apparent homology to any known molecule or structural motif. The C-terminal SH3 domain of Grap-2 alone is sufficient to bind to Gab-1. Furthermore, Northern blot analysis demonstrated that Grap-2 has two major transcripts of 1.4 and 4.0 kb that can only be detected in tissues rich in leukocytes and in two leukemia cell lines.

There are multiple forms of caveolins: caveolin-1 and caveolin-2 are expressed as stable heterooligomeric complexes within most cell types, while caveolin-3 is restricted to striated muscle cells. However, neither caveolin proteins nor caveolae structures are detected in peripheral blood cells or blood cell lines. We identified caveolin-1 in one T cell leukemia cell line, a subline of Jurkat cells, by immunostaining and Western blotting. The cells showed enlarged cell bodies similar to activated T cells. This led us to investigate caveolin expression in adult T cell leukemia (ATL) cell lines, which are known to be constitutively activated. Two of five ATL cell lines expressed caveolin-1. The phenotype of caveolin-1-positive cells expressed not only high levels of the T cell activation markers, as with CD25 or HLA-DR, but also CD54 at extremely high levels. These findings demonstrate for the first time that hematological cells express caveolin-1 in certain states of cell activation.

In situ morphological analysis by confocal microscopy showed the translocation of PI 3-K to the nucleus and to the subnuclear fractions. PI 3-K enzymatic activity was stimulated during the granulocytic differentiation process and parallelled the increase in content of nuclei and subnuclear fractions. PI 3-K activity was recovered in nuclei also without the addition of exogenous substrates, consistent with the presence of both substrates and enzyme in the nucleus.

The addition of these genes increases the total to five helicase genes in the human RecQ family, which includes helicases involved in Bloom and Werner syndromes, the genetic diseases manifesting the distinctive but overlapping clinical phenotypes of immunodeficiency, premature aging, and an enhanced risk of cancer. The RecQ4 helicase is as large as the Bloom (BLM) and Werner (WRN) helicases, and its gene expression profile is organ-specific, resembling that of BLM helicase. In contrast, the RecQ5 helicase has a low molecular weight, similar to the human progenitor RecQ1 helicase, and is expressed in all the organs examined. All five human helicase genes are expressed in cultured K562 leukemia and fibroblast cells. Synchronized K562 cell cultures showed that the genes RecQ4 and BLM, and RecQ1 and WRN, seem to be upregulated at the G1/S and G2/M phases, respectively, of the cell cycle. The biological significance of multiple species of human RecQ helicases, which are apparently nonessential for life but may be related to distinct diseases, is discussed in light of the fact that unicellular organisms, like Escherichia coli and yeast, contain only one species of helicase of this particular family.","['Kitao, S', 'Ohsugi, I', 'Ichikawa, K', 'Goto, M', 'Furuichi, Y', 'Shimamoto, A']","['Kitao S', 'Ohsugi I', 'Ichikawa K', 'Goto M', 'Furuichi Y', 'Shimamoto A']","['AGENE Research Institute, 200 Kajiwara, Kamakura, 247, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Genomics,Genomics,8800135,"['EC 3.6.1.- (Adenosine Triphosphatases)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (RECQL protein, human)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (RecQ protein, E coli)', 'EC 3.6.4.- (DNA Helicases)', 'EC 3.6.4.12 (RecQ Helicases)']",IM,"['Adenosine Triphosphatases/*genetics', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Cell Cycle/genetics', 'Chromosome Mapping', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 17', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'DNA Helicases/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Eukaryotic Cells/physiology', 'Expressed Sequence Tags', 'Humans', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Multigene Family', 'Phylogeny', 'RecQ Helicases', 'Sequence Analysis', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid']",1999/01/08 00:00,1999/01/08 00:01,['1999/01/08 00:00'],"['1999/01/08 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/01/08 00:01 [medline]', '1999/01/08 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0888-7543(98)95595-1 [pii]', '10.1006/geno.1998.5595 [doi]']",ppublish,Genomics. 1998 Dec 15;54(3):443-52. doi: 10.1006/geno.1998.5595.,,,,,,['Copyright 1998 Academic Press.'],"['GENBANK/AB006532', 'GENBANK/AB006533']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

This implies that the disease involves a breakdown of the blood-brain barrier. Since astrocytes play a central role in establishing this barrier, the authors investigated the hypothesis that the HTLV-I infected T cells disrupt this barrier by damaging the astrocytes. The present study revealed the HTLV-I-producing T cells conferred a severe cytopathic effect upon monolayers of astrocytoma cell line in co-cultures. Following co-cultivation, HTLV-I DNA and proteins appeared in the monolayer cells, but after reaching a peak their level gradually declined. This appearance of the viral components was proved to result from a fusion of the astrocytic cells with the virus-producing T cells, whereas their subsequent decline reflected the destruction of the resulting syncytia. This fusion could be specifically blocked by anti HTLV-I Env antibodies, indicating that it was mediated by the viral Env proteins expressed on the surface of the virus-producing cells. Similar fusion was observed between the HTLV-I-producing cells and certain other human nervous system cell lines. If such fusion of HTLV-I-infected T cells occurs also with astrocytes and other nervous system cells in TSP/HAM patients, it may account, at least partially, for the blood-brain barrier breakdown and some of the neural lesions in this syndrome.","['Mor-Vaknin, N', 'Turgeman, H', 'Torgeman, A', 'Wolfson, M', 'Huleihel, M', 'Aboud, M']","['Mor-Vaknin N', 'Turgeman H', 'Torgeman A', 'Wolfson M', 'Huleihel M', 'Aboud M']","['Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Faculty of Health Sciences, Ben Gurion University of the Negev, Beer Sheva, 84105, Israel.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Cell Biol Int,Cell biology international,9307129,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Culture Media, Conditioned)', '0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (Gene Products, env)', '0 (Gene Products, gag)', '0 (Retroviridae Proteins, Oncogenic)', '0 (gag Gene Products, Human Immunodeficiency Virus)', '0 (p19 protein, Human T-lymphotropic virus 1)']",IM,"['3T3 Cells', 'Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/immunology/pharmacology', 'Astrocytes/*pathology', 'Astrocytoma/pathology', '*Blood-Brain Barrier', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/*pathology/virology', 'Cell Death', 'Cell Fusion/drug effects', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Culture Media, Conditioned/pharmacology', '*Cytopathogenic Effect, Viral', 'DNA, Viral/analysis/biosynthesis', 'Gene Products, env/immunology', 'Gene Products, gag/analysis/biosynthesis/immunology', '*Giant Cells', 'HeLa Cells', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/immunology/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Kidney', 'Mice', 'Neurilemmoma/pathology', 'Neuroblastoma/pathology', 'Paraparesis, Tropical Spastic/*pathology/virology', 'Rats', 'Retroviridae Proteins, Oncogenic/analysis/biosynthesis', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Vacuoles', 'gag Gene Products, Human Immunodeficiency Virus']",1999/01/08 00:00,1999/01/08 00:01,['1999/01/08 00:00'],"['1999/01/08 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/01/08 00:01 [medline]', '1999/01/08 00:00 [entrez]']","['S1065-6995(98)90241-4 [pii]', '10.1006/cbir.1998.0241 [doi]']",ppublish,Cell Biol Int. 1998;22(2):95-103. doi: 10.1006/cbir.1998.0241.,,,,,,['Copyright 1998 Academic Press'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Twenty-eight patients were studied of whom 24 had a complete donor T cell chimerism. The malignancies were as follows: chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) in chronic phase (CP) (n = 9); more advanced CML (n = 5); multiple myeloma (MM) (n = 5); acute leukemia (AL) (n = 9). T cell doses varied from 0.1 x 10(7) to 33 x 10(7) T cells/kg. Eight patients received two to four DLI courses because they failed to respond to one course.

However, despite the infusion of high T cell doses (up to 32 x 10(7) T cells/kg), practically all patients with AL failed to respond. The likelihood of response was strongly related to the occurrence of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) in patients with CML and MM (P = 0.0002), although GVHD was not helpful for patients with AL. Higher T cell doses (> or = 10 x 10(7)/kg) induced serious GVHD (n = 17) and marrow aplasia (n = 5), and GVHD was directly or indirectly the cause of death for six patients.

Major toxicity was mucositis grade II according to the Bearman scale in all patients. The treatment-related mortality was 25%, mainly due to infection or GVHD after allogeneic transplantation.

Well established indications for use comprise intervention in patients with life-threatening infection, adjunctive therapy post autologous bone marrow transplantation (BMT), mobilization of peripheral blood progenitor cells for autologous BMT, patients with acquired aplastic anaemia on anti-lymphocyte globulin and cyclosporin regimen, and severe congenital neutropenia. Less clear indications include primary prophylaxis to support dose intensification in children with high risk/advanced malignancies, secondary prophylaxis to prevent neutropenia in patients with a history of severe neutropenia, support therapy in cases of poor marrow function following BMT and for deteriorating marrow function following successful BMT, in neonatal sepsis and non infectious neonatal neutropenia, in drug induced neutropenia and in HIV-positive patients. Treatment is generally well tolerated and granulocyte colony stimulating factor appears better tolerated than granulocyte and macrophage colony stimulating factor. Economically colony stimulating factors have not been shown to induce excessive costs for a given patient. CONCLUSION: In general the adult guidelines are applicable to children but additional considerations (aggressive or very progressive childhood neoplasms, specific indications, neonatal use, congenital disorders) must be taken into account.","['Schaison, G', 'Eden, O B', 'Henze, G', 'Kamps, W A', 'Locatelli, F', 'Ninane, J', 'Ortega, J', 'Riikonen, P', 'Wagner, H P']","['Schaison G', 'Eden OB', 'Henze G', 'Kamps WA', 'Locatelli F', 'Ninane J', 'Ortega J', 'Riikonen P', 'Wagner HP']","['Hospital Saint-Louis, Paris, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",Germany,Eur J Pediatr,European journal of pediatrics,7603873,"['0 (Colony-Stimulating Factors)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",IM,"['Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Child', 'Colony-Stimulating Factors/*therapeutic use', 'Europe', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/therapeutic use', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/therapeutic use', 'Hematologic Diseases/*drug therapy', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/drug therapy', 'Neutropenia/*drug therapy']",1999/01/07 00:00,1999/01/07 00:01,['1999/01/07 00:00'],"['1999/01/07 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/01/07 00:01 [medline]', '1999/01/07 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s004310050978 [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Pediatr. 1998 Dec;157(12):955-66. doi: 10.1007/s004310050978.,,,,76,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although gp130 contains a cytokine-binding homology region (CHR) analogous to the extracellular growth hormone receptor, the complexes that utilize gp130 are not simple dimerizations of receptors around a single cytokine but involve receptor interactions with additional sites on the ligand resulting in higher order complexes. Analysis by surface plasmon resonance of the binding of the immunoglobulin-like and CHR domains of the extracellular portion of gp130 to mutants of the cytokine oncostatin M reveal that the CHR forms the main binding site for oncostatin M by a classical site II interaction, but in addition a second interaction occurs involving the receptor's immunoglobulin-like domain and the cytokine's site III at the N-terminus of the D helix.

DATA SOURCES: MEDLINE database English language only, January 1990-March 1998; SmithKline Beecham Pharmaceuticals; published articles, books, and abstracts. STUDY SELECTION: Studies in humans with cancer, clinical case reports, open clinical trials, and controlled clinical studies. Efficacy studies were limited primarily to trials with at least 20 evaluable patients: DATA EXTRACTION: Relevant data were extracted only from published reports. Data were obtained from studies in both articles and abstracts. Only articles written in English were reviewed. DATA SYNTHESIS: Topotecan is an effective second- or third-line therapy for patients with advanced ovarian cancer and is comparable to ifosfamide, liposomal doxorubicin, and paclitaxel. Activity in combination with other agents and as a first-line agent is yet to be determined. Limited data indicate activity in small-cell lung cancer, cancers of the breast and uterus, and in nonlymphocytic leukemia. The dose-limiting toxicity is myelosuppression. CONCLUSIONS: Topotecan is an effective second-line agent for patients with unresponsive or relapsed cancer of the ovary. It appears to be similar to other active agents in patients with this disease status. Its ultimate role in ovarian cancer and other neoplasms awaits additional evaluation in combination with other agents and as first-line therapy.","['Cersosimo, R J']",['Cersosimo RJ'],"['Bouve College of Pharmacy & Health Sciences, Northeastern University, Boston, MA 02115, USA. r.cersosimo@nunet.neu.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Ann Pharmacother,The Annals of pharmacotherapy,9203131,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Topoisomerase I Inhibitors)', '7M7YKX2N15 (Topotecan)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/economics/pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Economics, Pharmaceutical', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/economics/pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Neoplasms/*drug therapy', '*Topoisomerase I Inhibitors', 'Topotecan/economics/pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use', 'Treatment Outcome']",1999/01/07 00:00,1999/01/07 00:01,['1999/01/07 00:00'],"['1999/01/07 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/01/07 00:01 [medline]', '1999/01/07 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1345/aph.18049 [doi]'],ppublish,Ann Pharmacother. 1998 Dec;32(12):1334-43. doi: 10.1345/aph.18049.,,,,85,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We investigated the prevalence and severity of alterations in growth and nutritional status in children with ALL from population-based referral areas in Canada. All children were treated with Dana-Farber Cancer Institute ALL Consortium protocols. First, the relative impact of cranial irradiation (CI) and chemotherapy on growth was studied in 116 children at diagnosis and at 6-month intervals during treatment. We observed a decline in height standard deviation (SD) score in the first year in all children, and a further decline in height SD score during the second year only in the children who received CI. Weight reduction occurred in the first year, but during the second year there was a disproportionate increase in weight compared with height, suggesting that children treated with ALL have a tendency toward obesity. Both chemotherapy and CI contribute to the altered growth observed in children treated for ALL. Second, intestinal functional integrity was assessed in 16 children during post-induction chemotherapy. Nutrient intake was adequate and there was minimal evidence of malabsorption: fat malabsorption occurred in only 1 child (after treatment-related pancreatitis), abnormal D-xylose absorption occurred in 2 children at 6 months of therapy (returning to normal 6 months later) and abnormal lactose absorption occurred in 4 children. Third, weight, height, whole body lean and fat mass measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry and serum albumin were determined at diagnosis and at 6-month intervals throughout therapy in 19 children with ALL. Height SD scores decreased significantly during treatment. Serum albumin was abnormally low in 6/19 at diagnosis and 14/18 during intensive consolidation therapy. The mean change in the ratio of lean mass to total body weight showed a 5% reduction by 6 months of therapy. Body fat increased from a mean of 22% at diagnosis to 28% at completion of therapy. The majority of children treated for ALL thus have significant changes in nutritional status manifested by reductions in growth, alterations in lean and fat body mass and abnormally low serum proteins during intensive therapy.","['Halton, J M', 'Atkinson, S A', 'Barr, R D']","['Halton JM', 'Atkinson SA', 'Barr RD']","[""Department of Pediatrics, Children's Hospital of Eastern Ontario, Ottawa, Canada.

The etiology is not completely understood but is probably multifactorial, including reduced ingestion and altered metabolism of nutrients. Changes in the host metabolism of protein, fat and carbohydrate in the cancer-bearing host have been demonstrated both in animal models and in patients. Changes include increased protein turnover and loss of the normal compensatory mechanisms seen in starvation. Additionally, increased lipid breakdown results in depletion of lipid stores and changes in carbohydrate metabolism result in an energy-losing cycle. The increase in protein turnover seen in children with leukemia may be related to the tumor, the chemotherapy administered or to related conditions such as febrile neutropenia. The role of endogenous mediators of cancer cachexia has not yet been clearly elucidated, although tumor necrosis factor, interleukin I and interleukin 6 appear to be involved. Studies of energy expenditure in children with cancer have indicated that certain patients with a raised metabolic rate are at particular risk of severe weight loss. The challenge is to identify these vulnerable patients and to provide adequate nutritional support early in treatment and therefore avoid the deleterious effects of cachexia.","['Picton, S V']",['Picton SV'],"['St. James University Hospital, Leeds, UK.

Thus, the effects of socio-economic status (SES) on the therapeutic response of children with cancer are obviously relevant.

Studies conducted mainly in developing countries have shown malnutrition to be an important prognostic factor in such children. However, other socio-economic conditions could affect the outcome of therapy in patients with ALL: access to communications, transportation, laboratory studies and therapy. Even in children with an ""adequate"" SES, malnutrition is still an adverse prognostic factor. Nutritional supplementation appears to be a valuable addition to chemotherapy in undernourished children with ALL. The choice of treatment for these children should accommodate the cultural, economic and nutritional status of the patients and their families. Protocols must be created for testing methods of nutritional intervention and their influence on pharmacology, drug tolerance and survival in ALL. The influences of poverty and illiteracy on compliance with treatment, especially oral medication, need to be evaluated.

They had been treated for acute leukemia (n = 22), brain tumors (n = 16), lymphomas (n = 16), Wilms' tumor (n = 10), neuroblastoma (n = 7) and other cancers (n = 26). The correlations between BMD and the Z-scores for weight for height, height for age and weight for age at diagnosis and follow-up were evaluated with stepwise multiple regression. Correlations with cumulative corticosteroid and radiation dose were examined with Spearman's correlation coefficient. The number of nature of fractures were noted. A BMD Z-score of below -2 was present in 13 and a BMD Z-score of -1 to -2 in 31 children. In total, a low BMD was observed in 45% of children. Height for age at follow-up correlated significantly with BMD Z-score. Increasing doses of cranial irradiation (18-54 Gy) were associated with lower BMD (p = 0.001, Spearman). This was true also for 22 children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) who had received 18-24 Gy cranial irradiation (p = 0.04, Spearman). Fractures occurred in 14 children following trauma. The difference in BMD Z-scores of children with and without fractures did not achieve statistical significance although the majority of the children with fractures had low BMD Z-scores. The significant inverse correlation between height for age at follow-up and BMD must be interpreted with the realization that DXA is not a volumetric measurement of BMD and that short stature is associated with a smaller skeletal mass.","['Hesseling, P B', 'Hough, S F', 'Nel, E D', 'van Riet, F A', 'Beneke, T', 'Wessels, G']","['Hesseling PB', 'Hough SF', 'Nel ED', 'van Riet FA', 'Beneke T', 'Wessels G']","['Department of Pediatrics and Child Health, Faculty of Medicine, University of Stellenbosch, Tygerberg, Republic of South Africa.

Elevated body-mass index (weight/height2; BMI) is frequent after treatment for childhood acute lymphoblastic leukaemia. BMI increases during therapy or within the first year after therapy and remains abnormal thereafter. Treatment with corticosteroids, abnormal growth-hormone secretion after treatment with cranial irradiation (CI) or corticosteroids, younger age at diagnosis, or female gender were risk factors for elevated BMI in earlier studies. We evaluated 185 survivors of childhood leukaemia or lymphoma by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry scanning. We found elevated whole-body relative fat mass, which was associated with CI. Other studies found reduced bone mass in the radius, the lumbar spine and the whole body after treatment for childhood cancer. Growth-hormone deficiency that is not adequately corrected, CI, reduced height or reduced weight were risk factors for reduced bone mass. In our 185 participants, the whole-body bone mass was also reduced significantly compared with reference values. CI and older age at follow-up were risk factors for reduced bone mass.

At diagnosis of ALL, > 70% of children had abnormally low plasma 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D, 73% had low osteocalcin and 64% had hypercalciuria, indicating an effect of the leukemic process on vitamin D metabolism and bone turnover. During remission induction, treatment with high-dose steroid (prednisone or dexamethasone) resulted in further reduction in plasma osteocalcin and elevated parathyroid hormone levels. During 24 months of chemotherapy-maintained remission, reduction in bone mineral content (BMC), as measured by Z-scores, occurred in 64% of children, most severely affecting those > 11 years of age. A reduction in BMC during the first 6 months had a positive predictive value of 64% for subsequent fracture. By the end of 2 years of therapy, fractures occurred in 39% of children and radiographic evidence of osteopenia was found in 83% of the entire study group. Investigations of the biochemical basis of the bone abnormalities revealed that by 6 months hypomagnesemia developed in 84% of children (of whom 52% were hypermagnesuric) and plasma 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D remained abnormally low in 70%. Altered magnesium status was attributed to renal wastage of magnesium following cyclical prednisone therapy and treatment with aminoglycoside antibiotics such as amikacin for fever accompanying neutropenia. Dietary intake and absorption of magnesium were normal. In 10 children treated for hypomagnesemia with supplemental magnesium for up to 16-20 weeks, plasma magnesium normalized in only 50% of subjects.","['Atkinson, S A', 'Halton, J M', 'Bradley, C', 'Wu, B', 'Barr, R D']","['Atkinson SA', 'Halton JM', 'Bradley C', 'Wu B', 'Barr RD']","['Department of Pediatrics, McMaster University, Hamilton, Ontario, Canada. satkins@fhs.csu.mcmaster.ca']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Int J Cancer Suppl,International journal of cancer.

The results of this synthesis suggest that children who are never breast-fed or are breast-fed short-term have a higher risk than those breast-fed for > or = 6 months of developing Hodgkin's disease (HD), but not non-Hodgkin's lymphoma or acute lymphoblastic leukemia. HD has features of a complex cellular immune disorder and of chronic infection. Human milk contains an extensive array of anti-microbial activity and appears to stimulate early development of the infant immune system. Artificially fed infants negotiate exposure to infectious agents without the benefits of this immunologic armament and do not do as well as breast-fed infants in resisting infection. Thus, human milk may make the breast-fed infant better able to negotiate future carcinogenic insults by modulating the interaction between infectious agents and the developing infant immune system or by directly affecting the long-term development of the infant immune system. Further research should attempt to confirm the association between infant feeding and HD in large, population-based, case-control studies. Improved measurement of infant feeding must be addressed if future studies are to advance our understanding of this association. In addition, studies of specific measures of immunity, particularly of cellular immune responses, should be conducted in populations of breast-fed and non-breast-fed young children.","['Davis, M K']",['Davis MK'],"['Division of Adolescent and School Health, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, GA 30341, USA. mkdl@cdc.gov']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Meta-Analysis']",United States,Int J Cancer Suppl,International journal of cancer.

However, unlike leukemias in older children, nearly 75% of infant leukemias demonstrate a specific abnormality involving a gene, MLL, on chromosome band 11q23. Molecular studies suggest strongly that these leukemias occur in utero. Treatment-related acute myeloid leukemias (AML), associated with specific chemotherapeutic agents that inhibit DNA topoisomerase II (topo 2), also manifest identical abnormalities involving the MLL gene. This led us to speculate that maternal exposure during pregnancy to environmental agents that inhibit DNA topo 2 may be associated with the development of leukemia in infants. DNA topo 2 inhibitors have been found in specific fruits and vegetables, and in soy, coffee, wine, tea and cocoa, as well as in certain pesticides, solvents and medications. In a preliminary study, we reinterviewed mothers of infant cases and their matched controls who had participated previously in 1 of 3 epidemiologic studies of childhood leukemia conducted by the Children's Cancer Group over a 10-year period. We evaluated potential DNA topo 2 inhibitor exposure through maternal diet and medications. Of the 84 original matched sets who were reinterviewed, there was no positive association with increasing maternal consumption of DNA topo 2 inhibitor-containing foods either for the overall group or for infants in the acute lymphoblastic leukemia stratum. However, there was an approximately 10-fold higher risk of infant AML with increasing maternal consumption of DNA topo 2 inhibitor-containing foods. The assay to screen environmental agents that inhibit DNA topo 2 has been established and new inhibitors are being identified routinely.","['Ross, J A']",['Ross JA'],"['Division of Pediatric Epidemiology-Clinical Research, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis 55455, USA. ross@epivax.epi.umn.edu']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Int J Cancer Suppl,International journal of cancer.

However, it is known that in Salvador, Bahia, 0.7% to 0.88% of pregnant women of low socio-economic class are HTLV-I carriers. Furthermore the occurrence of many cases of adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma and of four cases of infective dermatitis in Salvador, diseases directly linked to the vertical transmission of HTLV-I, indicates the importance of this route of infection among us. Through prenatal screening for HTLV-I and the refraining from breast-feeding a reduction of approximately 80% of vertical transmission has been observed in Japan. We suggest that in Brazil serologic screening for HTLV-I infection must be done for selected groups in the prenatal care: pregnant women from endemic areas, Japanese immigrants or Japanese descendents, intravenous drug users (IDU) or women whose partners are IDU, Human immunodeficiency virus carriers, pregnant women with promiscuous sexual behavior and pregnant women that have received blood transfusions in areas where blood donors screening is not performed.

Organochlorinated compounds are the most persistent pesticides and can be found in all ecosystems. Although they are generally efficient in pest control, they are also a potent environment pollutant and can provoke health problems in man. The evidences of the carcinogenic potential of organochlorines are controversial and insufficient, but they have been related to an increase in the incidence of some kinds of tumors, such as leukemia and solid tumors. Reproductive effects, due to anti-androgenic and estrogenic action, on embryonic virilization, the incidence of abortion and the frequency of prematurity, have also been observed. The accumulation of the organochlorines in the adipous tissue is positively correlated to the increase in aging and could be implicated in the development of aging diseases, such as Parkinson's disease.

The Pituitary Study Group.,441-5,"OBJECTIVE: The goal of our study was to determine the rate of neoplasms in patients with other pituitary adenomas (non-functioning and prolactinomas) in comparison with acromegaly which is known to favour the development of neoplasia. DESIGN AND PATIENTS: We reviewed clinical records for 220 patients with acromegaly, 151 patients with non-functioning pituitary adenoma (NF) and 98 patients with prolactinomas. Incidence rates of cancer for patients with pituitary tumours were calculated per person-years of follow-up study. These rates were then compared with sex and age adjusted incidence rates reported by National Tumour Registry. An internal control group of 163 subjects with a non-neoplastic condition, i.e. Graves' disease followed chronically in the same clinic was also studied. The ratios observed to expected were expressed as standardized incidence rates (SIR). The only significant difference between the acromegalic and other pituitary tumours patients was in hypopituitarism, present in 18.2% (acromegaly) 47% (NF) and 18.6% (prolactinomas). RESULTS: Twenty-three malignant tumours were registered in 19 acromegalics (1 Hodgkin disease, 1 myelogenous leukaemia, 1 lymphocytic leukaemia, 3 papillary thyroid carcinomas, 1 ovarian carcinoma, 2 colorectal carcinoma, 1 renal cell carcinoma, 4 cervical carcinoma, 2 skin cancers, 2 pancreatic carcinoma, 4 breast carcinoma, 1 bladder carcinoma). Three acromegalics harboured two malignancies. Patients with acromegaly had a 3.39-fold increased rate of malignant tumours compared with the general population and a 3.21-fold increased rate compared with our internal control group. Eleven malignant tumours were found in patients with NF-pituitary adenomas and 2 in prolactinoma patients (1 lymphoma, 1 multiple myeloma, 1 colonic cancer, 1 renal cell cancer, 1 stomach cancer, 2 lung cancers, 1 cervix carcinoma, 1 breast cancer, 1 testicular carcinoma and 3 melanoma). Patients with NF pituitary adenomas had a 3.91-fold increased rate of malignant tumours compared with the general population and 4.07-fold increase compared with the internal control group.

However, there have been only a few case reports of a relationship between Down's syndrome and brain tumors. We report 2 cases with histological diagnoses of germinoma. The 1st case was a 10-year-old boy with Down's syndrome complaining of seizure and left hemiparesis. Computed tomographic (CT) scan and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed a mass lesion in the right basal ganglia and thalamus. Histological examination indicated two cell pattern germinomas. The 2nd case was a 20-year-old man with Down's syndrome complaining of headache and vomiting. CT scan and MRI showed a pineal region tumor with marked hydrocephalus. Surgical specimens showed typical germinoma. Only 13 cases of brain tumors associated with Down's syndrome have been reported.

The key intermediates in the synthesis are benz[g]isoquinoline-5,10-diones which are substituted at positions 6 and 9 with groups of different nucleofugacity for SNAr displacements. The initial displacement of fluoride by a substituted hydrazine leads to the pyrazole analogues. Substitution of the remaining leaving group by an amine or BOC-protected amines leads to the 9-aza-APs 12. These analogues were converted into their maleate or hydrochloride salts 13. In two cases, namely, 13x and 13z, sidearm buildup was also employed in the synthetic pathway. In vitro evaluation of 9-aza-APs against the human colon tumor cell line LoVo uncovered for most of the compounds a cytotoxic potency lower than that of DuP-941 or mitoxantrone and comparable to that of doxorubicin. Only analogues 13c, 13n, and 13ff were as cytotoxic as DuP-941. Interestingly, while DuP-941 was highly cross-resistant in the LoVo cell line resistant to doxorubicin (LoVo/Dx), the 9-aza-APs carrying a distal lipophilic tertiary amine moiety in both chains were capable of overcoming the MDR resistance induced in this cell line. The 9-aza-APs show outstanding in vivo antitumor activity against both systemic P388 murine leukemia and MX-1 human mammary carcinoma transplanted in nude mice. At their optimal dosages, congeners 13a-c, 13f, 13n, 13q, 13x, and 13dd were highly effective against P388 leukemia with T/C% of 200-381, while the T/C% value of DuP-941 was 147.

Approximately 51% of 0.2 microM hypericin-treated cells were stained with NBT and 63% showed phagocytic activity. In order to establish whether hypericin induces differentiation of U-937 cells to macrophage or granulocyte, esterase activities and cell sizes were measured. When U-937 cells were treated with 0.2 microM and 0.15 microM of hypericin, the alpha-naphthyl acetate esterase activity was increased by 38.4% and 48.1%, respectively, but naphthol AS-D chloroacetate esterase activity was not influenced. The size of hypericin-treated cells in terms of cell mass was larger than that observed in untreated cells as determined by flow cytometry. Protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitor, NA-382, decreased the NBT reducing activity of hypericin, whereas a cAMP-dependent protein kinase A (PKA) inhibitor, H-89, did not show any influence on the differentiation.

CKD602 was a nanomolar inhibitor of the topoisomerase I enzyme in the cleavable complex assay. CKD602 was found to be 3 times and slightly more potent than topotecan and camptothecin as inhibitors of topoisomerase, respectively. In tumor cell cytotoxicity, CKD602 was more potent than topotecan in 14 out of 26 human cancer cell lines tested, while it was comparable to camptothecin. CKD602 was tested for the in vivo antitumor activity against the human tumor xenograft models. CKD602 was able to induce regression of established HT-29, WIDR and CX-1 colon tumors, LX-1 lung tumor, MX-1 breast tumor and SKOV-3 ovarian tumor as much as 80, 94, 76, 67, 87% and 88%, respectively, with comparable body weight changes to those of topotecan. Also the therapeutic margin (R/Emax: maximum tolerance dose/ED58) of CKD602 was significantly higher than that of topotecan by 4 times. Efficacy was determined at the maximal tolerated dose levels using schedule dependent i.p. administration in mice bearing L1210 leukemia. On a Q4dx4 (every 4 day for 4 doses) schedule, the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) was 25 mg/kg per administration, which caused great weight loss and lethality in < 5% tumor bearing mouse. This schedule brought significant increase in life span (ILS), 212%, with 33% of long-term survivals. The ex vivo antitumor activity of CKD602 was compared with that of topotecan and the mean antitumor index (ATI) values recorded for CKD602 were significantly higher than that noted for topotecan. From these results, CKD602 warrants further clinical investigations as a potent inhibitor of topoisomerase I.","['Lee, J H', 'Lee, J M', 'Kim, J K', 'Ahn, S K', 'Lee, S J', 'Kim, M Y', 'Jew, S S', 'Park, J G', 'Hong, C I']","['Lee JH', 'Lee JM', 'Kim JK', 'Ahn SK', 'Lee SJ', 'Kim MY', 'Jew SS', 'Park JG', 'Hong CI']","['Chong Kun Dang Research Institute, Chong Kun Dang Corp., Seoul, Korea.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Korea (South),Arch Pharm Res,Archives of pharmacal research,8000036,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Topoisomerase I Inhibitors)', '27Z82M2G1N (belotecan)', 'XT3Z54Z28A (Camptothecin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology', 'Camptothecin/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Dogs', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Nude', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', '*Topoisomerase I Inhibitors']",1999/01/06 00:00,1999/01/06 00:01,['1999/01/06 00:00'],"['1999/01/06 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/01/06 00:01 [medline]', '1999/01/06 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF02975379 [doi]'],ppublish,Arch Pharm Res. 1998 Oct;21(5):581-90. doi: 10.1007/BF02975379.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The 40-kDa Tax oncoprotein serves as a potent transcriptional activator that induces viral gene expression driven by the HTLV-1 long terminal repeats and also stimulates multiple cellular genes involved in T cell activation, cell cycle regulation, and gene activation. Since Tax has been shown to interact directly and indirectly with the NF-kappa B/I kappa B regulatory proteins, we examined the significance of an in vivo association between Tax and the I kappa B alpha inhibitor. Using GST affinity chromatography, Tax was shown to interact with the I kappa B alpha ankyrin repeats which are essential for interaction with the NF-kappa B/Rel proteins. In vivo, using I kappa B alpha mutants and co-immunoprecipitation, a preferential interaction between HTLV-1 Tax and N-terminally hypophosphorylated I kappa B alpha was detected. Tax also enhanced binding of I kappa B alpha to the proteasome subunit HsN3, resulting in a Tax-enhanced, constitutive degradation of wild-type and mutated forms of I kappa B alpha in the absence of phosphorylation and ubiquitination. Binding of I kappa B alpha to proteasome subunit HC9 was also observed, but this interaction occurred independently of Tax. Taken together, these results suggest a role for Tax as a viral chaperone resulting in the enhanced constitutive turnover of I kappa B alpha. The association of Tax with hypophosphorylated I kappa B alpha may prevent I kappa B alpha from binding to NF-kappa B and also target I kappa B alpha to the proteasome for degradation via a phosphorylation-independent pathway.","['Petropoulos, L', 'Hiscott, J']","['Petropoulos L', 'Hiscott J']","['Terry Fox Molecular Oncology Group, Lady Davis Institute for Medical Research, Sir Mortimer B.

The Graffi murine leukemia virus causes exclusively myeloid leukemia, but the tumor cells are clearly of granulocytic nature (Ru et al. (1993). J. Virol. 67, 4722). We were interested to understand the role of the long terminal repeat (LTR) U3 region in the myeloid specificity of these two retroviruses. We used DNase I footprinting and gel mobility shift assays to identify a number of protein binding sites within Cas-Br-E and Graffi U3 regions. The pattern of protected regions is highly similar for the two viruses. Some factors identified in other murine leukemia viruses, like the core binding factor, also bind to Cas-Br-E and Graffi LTR; however, other binding sites seem specific for these two viruses. Only one difference between them was noted, at the 5' end of the U3 region. Transcriptional activity of both LTRs was also analyzed in various cell lines and compared with other murine leukemia viruses. The results show a slight myeloid specificity for the two LTRs, and indicate that the Graffi enhancer is quite strong in a broad range of cell types.","['Barat, C', 'Rassart, E']","['Barat C', 'Rassart E']","['Departement des Sciences Biologiques, Universite du Quebec a Montreal, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Virology,Virology,0110674,"['0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Binding Sites/genetics', 'Cell Line', 'DNA Footprinting', 'DNA, Viral/*chemistry/metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/chemistry/*genetics/metabolism', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'Genes, Reporter', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*genetics', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Terminal Repeat Sequences/*genetics', 'Transcription, Genetic']",1999/01/06 00:00,1999/01/06 00:01,['1999/01/06 00:00'],"['1999/01/06 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/01/06 00:01 [medline]', '1999/01/06 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0042-6822(98)99435-1 [pii]', '10.1006/viro.1998.9435 [doi]']",ppublish,Virology. 1998 Dec 5;252(1):82-95. doi: 10.1006/viro.1998.9435.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It has been shown that the SFFVp glycoprotein, gp55, interacts with the erythropoietin receptor (EPO-R) and promotes EPO-independent proliferation of an EPO-R-expressing hematopoietic cell line, Ba/F3 (Li et al., Nature 343:762, 1990). We show here that when residues within the transmembrane (TM) sequence of an SFFVp gp55 are altered based on the sequences of the anemia-inducing gp55s by a methionine-to-isoleucine (M-I) substitution, a di-leucine deletion (dLL), or both, the resulting mutants display an attenuated phenotype that resembles an SFFVa: they induce milder erythroproliferative disease without polycythemia in vivo and are unable to promote EPO-independent cell proliferation in vitro. The dLL mutation directly interferes with EPO-R binding by decreasing the affinity of gp55 for the receptor. On the other hand, the M-I mutation hampers the full mitogenic activation of EPO-R while having no effect on receptor binding and asserts a dominant negative effect over the wild-type SFFVp gp55. Two other sequence changes within the TM sequence did not affect the biological activities of the SFFVp gp55. These results indicate that the TM sequence of the SFFV env glycoprotein plays a prominent role in SFFV-induced erythroleukemogenesis through its influence on the mitogenic activation of EPO-R.","['Fang, C', 'Choi, E', 'Nie, L', 'Li, J P']","['Fang C', 'Choi E', 'Nie L', 'Li JP']","['Department of Microbiology, New York University Medical Center, New York, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Virology,Virology,0110674,"['0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)', '0 (glycoprotein gp55, Friend spleen focus-forming virus)']",IM,"['3T3 Cells', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*virology', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/*chemistry/genetics', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutagenesis, Site-Directed', 'Spleen Focus-Forming Viruses/genetics/*pathogenicity', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Viral Envelope Proteins/*chemistry/genetics']",1999/01/06 00:00,1999/01/06 00:01,['1999/01/06 00:00'],"['1999/01/06 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/01/06 00:01 [medline]', '1999/01/06 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0042-6822(98)99453-3 [pii]', '10.1006/viro.1998.9453 [doi]']",ppublish,Virology. 1998 Dec 5;252(1):46-53. doi: 10.1006/viro.1998.9453.,['CA57335/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recombinant human DNA fragmentation factor 45 kDa subunit (DFF45/ICAD), an inhibitor of the caspase-activated DNase DFF40/CAD, substituted for healthy cytosol in inhibiting DNA fragmentation.

Angiotensin II (AII) is also known to activate STATs and reported to induced apoptosis in adult rat ventricular myocytes. In the present study, we investigated potential interactions between gp130 dependent and AII signaling pathways, by examining AII regulation of LIF-induced anti-apoptotic effect and STAT3 activation in cardiac myocytes. Although LIF attenuated the DNA fragmentation induced by serum depletion, AII augmented the DNA fragmentation in cultured neonatal rat cardiac myocytes. Furthermore, LIF-mediated cytoprotective effect was inhibited by AII pretreatment. LIF rapidly and transiently tyrosine phosphorylated STAT3 in cardiac myocytes which was not observed by AII. AII pretreatment inhibited LIF-induced phosphorylation of STAT3 in a dose dependent manner.

By using recombination-inducible scid pre-B cell lines transformed with the temperature-sensitive Abelson-murine leukemia virus, we show that large quantities of recombination intermediates can be generated, and their resolution can be followed during further cell culture. In this study, we demonstrate that the ability of these scid pre-B cell lines to resolve coding ends depends on the cell culture temperature. At the nonpermissive temperature of 39 degreesC, scid pre-B cell lines fail to form coding joints and contain mostly unresolved hairpin-coding ends. Once the cell culture is returned to the permissive temperature of 33 degreesC, these same cells make a significant amount of coding joints concomitant with the disappearance of hairpin-coding ends. Thus, the scid cells are capable of resolving coding ends under certain culture conditions. However, the majority of the recovered coding joints contains extensive deletions, indicating that the temperature-dependent resolution of coding ends is still scid-like. Our results suggest that the inability of scid cells to promptly nick hairpin-coding ends may lead to aberrant joining in these cells.","['Chang, Y', 'Brown, M L']","['Chang Y', 'Brown ML']","['Department of Microbiology, Molecular and Cellular Biology Program, Arizona State University, Tempe, AZ 85287-2701, USA. yung.chang@asu.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (Immunoglobulin Joining Region)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Variable Region)']",IM,"['Animals', 'B-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Cell Line', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*immunology', 'Immunoglobulin Joining Region/*genetics', 'Immunoglobulin Variable Region/*genetics', 'Mice', 'Mice, SCID', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Nucleic Acid Conformation', '*Recombination, Genetic', 'Severe Combined Immunodeficiency/*immunology']",1999/01/06 00:00,1999/01/06 00:01,['1999/01/06 00:00'],"['1999/01/06 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/01/06 00:01 [medline]', '1999/01/06 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1073/pnas.96.1.191 [doi]'],ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1999 Jan 5;96(1):191-6. doi: 10.1073/pnas.96.1.191.,"['R01 CA073857/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R29 CA073857/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA73857/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,PMC15115,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The traditional approach for such applications has been to formulate the pharmaceutical agent in liposomes prior to administration in vivo. In this report we demonstrate that liposomes exhibiting a transmembrane pH gradient injected intravenously (iv) can actively encapsulate doxorubicin in the circulation after iv administration of free drug. Small (110 nm) liposomes composed of phosphatidylcholine (PC)/cholesterol (Chol, 55:45 mol:mol) exhibiting a pH gradient (inside acidic) were administered iv 1 h prior to free doxorubicin, and plasma drug levels as well as toxicity and efficacy were evaluated. Predosing with egg PC/Chol pH gradient liposomes increased the plasma concentration of doxorubicin as much as 200-fold compared to free drug alone as well as to predosing with dipalmitoyl PC/Chol pH gradient liposomes or EPC/Chol liposomes without a pH gradient. The ability of the liposomes to alter the pharmacokinetics of doxorubicin was dependent on the presence of a transmembrane pH gradient and correlated with the extent of doxorubicin uptake into the liposomes at 37 degreesC in pH 7.5 buffer, indicating that doxorubicin was being actively accumulated in the circulating liposomes. This in vivo drug loading was achieved over a range of doxorubicin doses (5 mg/kg-40 mg/kg) and was dependent on the dose of EPC/Chol liposomes administered prior to free doxorubicin injection. The altered pharmacokinetic properties of doxorubicin associated with in vivo doxorubicin encapsulation were accompanied by a decrease in drug toxicity and maintained antitumor potency. These results suggest that pretreatment with empty liposomes exhibiting a pH gradient may provide a versatile and straightforward method for enhancing the pharmacological properties of many drugs that can accumulate into such vesicle systems at physiological temperatures.","['Mayer, L D', 'Reamer, J', 'Bally, M B']","['Mayer LD', 'Reamer J', 'Bally MB']","['Advanced Therapeutics Department BC Cancer Agency 600 West 10th Avenue, Vancouver, B.C.

Control cells were transfected with vector lacking antisense DNA (V-HEL cells). GAP1(IP4BP) protein, which is a member of the GTPase-activating protein (GAP1) family, was reduced by 85% in AS-HEL cells and was further reduced by 96% by treatment with isopropylthio-beta-D- galactoside to relieve LacI repression. The loss of GAP1(IP4BP) was associated with both a membrane hyperpolarization and a substantially increased Ca2+ entry induced by thrombin or thapsigargin. The activation of intermediate conductance Ca2+-activated K+ channels in AS-HEL cells (not seen in V-HEL cells) was responsible for the membrane hyperpolarization and the enhanced Ca2+ entry, and both were blocked by charybdotoxin. Stimulated V-HEL cells did not hyperpolarize and basal Ca2+ influx was unaffected by charybdotoxin. In V-HEL cells hyperpolarized by removal of extracellular K+, the thapsigargin-stimulated Ca2+ influx was increased. Expression of mRNA for the human Ca2+-activated intermediate conductance channel KCa4 was equivalent in both AS-HEL and V-HEL cells, suggesting that the specific appearance of calcium-activated potassium current (IK(Ca)) in AS-HEL cells was possibly due to modulation of preexisting channels. Our results demonstrate that GAP1(IP4BP), likely working through a signaling pathway dependent on a small GTP-binding protein, can regulate the function of K(Ca) channels that produce a hyperpolarizing current that substantially enhances the magnitude and time course of Ca2+ entry subsequent to the release of internal Ca2+ stores.","['Lu, X', 'Fein, A', 'Feinstein, M B', ""O'Rourke, F A""]","['Lu X', 'Fein A', 'Feinstein MB', ""O'Rourke FA""]","['Department of Pharmacology, The University of Connecticut Health Center, Farmington, Connecticut 06030, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Gen Physiol,The Journal of general physiology,2985110R,"['0 (DNA, Antisense)', '0 (Potassium Channels)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Cytoplasmic and Nuclear)', '0 (inositol-1,3,4,5-tetrakisphosphate receptor)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)', 'TSN3DL106G (Fura-2)']",IM,"['Blotting, Western', 'Calcium/*metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'DNA, Antisense/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Electric Stimulation', 'Electrophysiology', 'Fura-2', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/metabolism', 'Membrane Potentials/physiology', 'Patch-Clamp Techniques', 'Potassium Channels/*metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis', 'Receptors, Cytoplasmic and Nuclear/*biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Transfection']",1999/01/05 00:00,1999/01/05 00:01,['1999/01/05 00:00'],"['1999/01/05 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/01/05 00:01 [medline]', '1999/01/05 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1085/jgp.113.1.81 [doi]'],ppublish,J Gen Physiol. 1999 Jan;113(1):81-96. doi: 10.1085/jgp.113.1.81.,,,PMC2222987,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Thirty-two children with ALL were studied at the end of treatment and 5 years later by brain MRI and the results were compared with the neuropsychologic findings. Fifteen patients had received chemotherapy alone and 17 had received chemotherapy plus cranial radiation. RESULTS: MRI of the brain was abnormal in 6 of 30 patients at the end of treatment and in 8 of 32 patients 5 years later. White matter changes (WMC) were found in 3 patients at the end of treatment and in 4 patients 5 years later. Two patients had developed new mild changes, whereas in one case WMC had normalized during the follow-up. Two patients had old hemorrhages or calcifications at each examination, with some improvement after follow-up, although one case revealed a new calcification or hemorrhage. Signs of cortical atrophy were observed in five patients at both evaluations. The patients with abnormal MRI findings did not differ significantly in their performance in the neuropsychologic tests from the patients with normal MRI findings, but the two patients with persistent WMC had a depression of verbal functions. CONCLUSIONS: Abnormalities in brain MRI were infrequent at the end of treatment for childhood ALL and 5 years later. They did not appear to correlate significantly with neuropsychologic outcome. Brain MRI is not very informative as a routine follow-up method during the first 5 years after treatment.","['Harila-Saari, A H', 'Paakko, E L', 'Vainionpaa, L K', 'Pyhtinen, J', 'Lanning, B M']","['Harila-Saari AH', 'Paakko EL', 'Vainionpaa LK', 'Pyhtinen J', 'Lanning BM']","['Department of Pediatrics, Oulu University Central Hospital, Finland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', '*Brain', 'Child', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Cranial Irradiation', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Intelligence Tests', 'Learning Disabilities/etiology', 'Longitudinal Studies', '*Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Male', 'Neuropsychological Tests', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/radiotherapy/*therapy', '*Survivors']",1999/01/05 21:59,2000/06/20 09:00,['1999/01/05 21:59'],"['1999/01/05 21:59 [pubmed]', '2000/06/20 09:00 [medline]', '1999/01/05 21:59 [entrez]']",['10.1002/(SICI)1097-0142(19981215)83:12<2608::AID-CNCR28>3.0.CO;2-L [pii]'],ppublish,Cancer. 1998 Dec 15;83(12):2608-17.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We found 26 other examples of therapy related leukemia in adult and pediatric brain tumor patients. Including our two, there were 12 patients with malignant glioma; median interval from treatment to diagnosis of AML was 31 months. Nine adult malignant glioma patients all received nitrosoureas, some as the sole form of chemotherapy. No definite cases occurred after radiotherapy alone. Based upon analogy with other cancers, the cumulative dose of chemotherapy, especially alkylating agents, is the major risk factor for development of secondary AML. Agents implicated include carmustine (BCNU), lomustine (CCNU), and procarbazine. Conventional radiotherapy appears not to confer additional risk. Progressive macrocytosis, early dose reductions for thrombocytopenia, and refractory anemia may provide early diagnostic clues. Current glioma therapy is leukemogenic but the number of patients who survive the interval required to induce AML is small; nevertheless, the identification of chemosensitive types of glioma, and subgroups of patients who derive the most benefit from chemotherapy, may result in increasing numbers of patients at risk of long term complications. If regimens such as PCV continue to prove valuable in neurooncology the risk of leukemia will require integration into the clinical decision process. A search for more effective therapy with minimal mutagenicity remains critical.","['Perry, J R', 'Brown, M T', 'Gockerman, J P']","['Perry JR', 'Brown MT', 'Gockerman JP']","['Division of Neurology, Duke University Medical Center, Durham, NC, USA.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,J Neurooncol,Journal of neuro-oncology,8309335,"['35S93Y190K (Procarbazine)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '7BRF0Z81KG (Lomustine)', 'PCV protocol']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*adverse effects', 'Brain Neoplasms/*drug therapy', 'Fatal Outcome', 'Female', 'Glioma/*drug therapy', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*chemically induced', 'Lomustine/adverse effects', 'Male', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/*chemically induced', 'Procarbazine/adverse effects', 'Vincristine/adverse effects']",1999/01/05 00:00,1999/01/05 00:01,['1999/01/05 00:00'],"['1999/01/05 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/01/05 00:01 [medline]', '1999/01/05 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1023/a:1006175831785 [doi]'],ppublish,J Neurooncol. 1998 Oct;40(1):39-46. doi: 10.1023/a:1006175831785.,,,,56,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Therefore, it was examined whether quercetin, which has been shown to interfere with the formation of the complex between HSE and HSF, and to downregulate the level of HSF1, can sensitize MDR cells against anticancer drugs by inhibition of HSF DNA-binding activity. In this study, quercetin appeared to inhibit the constitutive HSF DNA-binding activity and the sodium arsenite-induced HSF DNA-binding activity in the MDR cells. The basal and sodium arsenite-induced MDRCAT activities were remarkably suppressed by the treatment of quercetin. These results were well consistent with the finding that the treatment of quercetin decreased the expression level of P-gp, MDR1 gene product, in dose-dependent manner, and markedly increased the sensitivity of MDR cells to vincristine or vinblastine. These results suggest that quercetin can decrease the expression of P-gp via inhibition of HSF DNA-binding activity, and might be useful as a chemosensitizer in MDR cells.","['Kim, S H', 'Yeo, G S', 'Lim, Y S', 'Kang, C D', 'Kim, C M', 'Chung, B S']","['Kim SH', 'Yeo GS', 'Lim YS', 'Kang CD', 'Kim CM', 'Chung BS']","['Department of Biochemistry, College of Medicine, Pusan National University, Korea.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Exp Mol Med,Experimental & molecular medicine,9607880,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Arsenites)', '0 (Heat-Shock Proteins)', '0 (Sodium Compounds)', '48OVY2OC72 (sodium arsenite)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '5V9KLZ54CY (Vinblastine)', '9IKM0I5T1E (Quercetin)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/drug effects/genetics', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Arsenites/pharmacology', 'Carcinoma/drug therapy', 'Drug Resistance, Multiple/*physiology', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/physiology', 'Heat-Shock Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Experimental/drug therapy', 'Mice', 'Quercetin/*pharmacology', 'Sodium Compounds/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Vinblastine/pharmacology', 'Vincristine/pharmacology']",1999/01/05 00:00,1999/01/05 00:01,['1999/01/05 00:00'],"['1999/01/05 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/01/05 00:01 [medline]', '1999/01/05 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/emm.1998.13 [doi]'],ppublish,Exp Mol Med. 1998 Jun 30;30(2):87-92. doi: 10.1038/emm.1998.13.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The enhancement of PLD activity was also observed in the anti-Fas/Apo1 monoclonal antibody-treated A20 cells. However, the activity of PLD was maximized when HL-60 and A20 cells were treated with either TNF-alpha or anti-Fas/Apo1 monoclonal antibody for 6 h. Both TNF-alpha and anti-Fas/Apo1 monoclonal antibody increased PLD activity in a dose-dependent manner up to 200 U/ml and 200 ng/ml, respectively. When the intracellular activity of protein kinase C (PKC) was interrupted by treatment of calphostin-C, both the PLD activation and the apoptosis induced by TNF-alpha and anti-Fas/Apo1 monoclonal antibody appeared to be inhibited.

Determination of the cell lineage of CML blasts is clinically important because patients with lymphoid blast transformation have a better response to chemotherapy and longer survival than those with other lineages. We studied the morphologic, cytochemical, immunophenotypic, cytogenetic, and molecular features of 20 patients with Philadelphia chromosome-positive CML and more than 10% blast cells in peripheral blood or bone marrow. The blasts were morphologically heterogeneous. CD33 was expressed in 19 cases (95%), followed by CD13 (85%), CD11c (80%), CD36 (60%), CD117 (40%), and CD15 (30%). Seven cases (35%) had a precursor-B lymphoid immunophenotype, and 13 (65%) had a predominantly myeloid immunophenotype. Of the former group, of which only one had a pure lymphoid phenotype, terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT) and CD19 were expressed in 100%, CD10 in 85.7%, and CD20 in 14.3%. Of the latter group, all 13 expressed from 3 to 6 myeloid antigens, with 46.2% myeloperoxidase positive and 69.2% CD61 positive. No cases were interpreted as T lineage, but the T-cell antigens CD3, CD4, CD5, and CD7 were expressed in 5.0, 40.0, 5.3. and 30.0% of all cases, respectively. In most cases, the immunophenotype of the CML blasts could not be predicted from their morphologic features. Polymerase chain reaction showed that 80.0% of the lymphoid group and 37.5% of the myeloid group had immunoglobulin heavy-chain gene rearrangements. The frequent lineage infidelity of the blast cells in CML BT seems to be related to the stem cell origin of this disorder. Such lineage infidelity, however, makes classification of many cases difficult and the significance of and criteria for biphenotypic blast crisis of CML is yet to be determined.","['Khalidi, H S', 'Brynes, R K', 'Medeiros, L J', 'Chang, K L', 'Slovak, M L', 'Snyder, D S', 'Arber, D A']","['Khalidi HS', 'Brynes RK', 'Medeiros LJ', 'Chang KL', 'Slovak ML', 'Snyder DS', 'Arber DA']","['Division of Pathology, City of Hope National Medical Center, Duarte, California 91010, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Mod Pathol,"Modern pathology : an official journal of the United States and Canadian Academy of Pathology, Inc",8806605,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antigens, CD/analysis', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/analysis', 'B-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Gene Rearrangement, B-Lymphocyte, Heavy Chain/genetics', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/immunology/pathology', 'Humans', '*Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/genetics/*immunology/*pathology', '*Lymphocyte Activation', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Phenotype', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'RNA, Neoplasm/analysis', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology']",1999/01/01 00:00,1999/01/01 00:01,['1999/01/01 00:00'],"['1999/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1999/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Mod Pathol. 1998 Dec;11(12):1211-21.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The white blood cell count (WBC) at the time of diagnosis is a further very important prognostic factor in childhood ALL. Therefore we compared the relation between trisomy of distinct chromosomes and the initial white blood cell count of 41 children with common ALL and hyperdiploid karyotype.

However, most attempts have been hindered by the inability to deliver genes efficiently and to obtain sustained expression in cells growing in vivo. In this paper we describe a method for producing high-titer MSCV virus using the pCL acute retroviral packaging system. This method facilitates the generation of MSCV virus encoding genes that convey the cytostatic or cytocidal phenotypes of benefit in the treatment of cancer. Amphotropic MSCV virus with an average titer of 6 x 10(6) CFU/ml has been routinely produced in this system. We demonstrate that, unlike the pCL retroviral vectors, the MSCV vector is capable of directing sustained in vivo expression of the green fluorescent protein in infected glioma cells following implantation and tumor growth in nude mice.","['Norris, P S', 'Jepsen, K', 'Haas, M']","['Norris PS', 'Jepsen K', 'Haas M']","['Department of Biology and Cancer Center, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla 92093-0063, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Netherlands,J Virol Methods,Journal of virological methods,8005839,"['0 (Luminescent Proteins)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '147336-22-9 (Green Fluorescent Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Cytomegalovirus/genetics', 'Female', 'Genes, Tumor Suppressor/*genetics', 'Genes, Viral', '*Genetic Vectors', 'Green Fluorescent Proteins', 'Luminescent Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Nude', 'Microscopy, Fluorescence', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/*genetics', 'Rats', 'Recombinant Proteins/biosynthesis', 'Retroviridae/*genetics/*growth & development/metabolism']",1998/12/31 00:00,1998/12/31 00:01,['1998/12/31 00:00'],"['1998/12/31 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/12/31 00:01 [medline]', '1998/12/31 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0166093498001086 [pii]', '10.1016/s0166-0934(98)00108-6 [doi]']",ppublish,J Virol Methods. 1998 Nov;75(2):161-7. doi: 10.1016/s0166-0934(98)00108-6.,['R01CA56075/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Total body irradiation (TBI) is an effective modality against AML when used in doses of 1000-1400 cGy with hematopoietic stem cell support. We undertook a phase I study of TBI with granulocyte-colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) support, without stem cell support in patients with AML either in relapse or second or subsequent remission. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Patients with relapsed AML, or AML in second or subsequent remission were treated in a phase I study of TBI followed by G-CSF. The first dose level was 200 cGy. After the initial cohort of patients it was clear that patients with overt leukemia did not benefit from this treatment, and subsequent patients were required to be in remission at the time of TBI. RESULTS: Eleven patients were treated, 4 in overt relapse, and 7 in remission. 200 cGy was used in all, and dose escalation was not possible due to prolonged thrombocytopenia in all patients but one. Neutrophil recovery was adequate in those patients who remained in remission after TBI. Patients with overt leukemia had transient reduction in blast counts, but rapid recurrence of their leukemia. Patients treated in remission had short remissions, with the exception of one patient who is in remission 32 months after treatment. CONCLUSION: There is some antileukemic effect of TBI even at 200 cGy, though this dose appears to be too low to help a significant number of patients. If TBI is to be escalated without stem cell support, then a thrombopoietic agent will need to be used.","['Shulman, L N', 'Tarbell, N J', 'Storen, E', 'Marcus, K', 'Mauch, P M']","['Shulman LN', 'Tarbell NJ', 'Storen E', 'Marcus K', 'Mauch PM']","[""Division of Hematology-Oncology, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Clinical Trial, Phase I', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys,"International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics",7603616,['143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)'],IM,"['Aged', 'Blast Crisis', 'Female', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/pathology/*radiotherapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Platelet Count', 'Radiotherapy Dosage', 'Recurrence', 'Remission Induction', 'Thrombocytopenia/etiology', '*Whole-Body Irradiation']",1998/12/30 00:00,1998/12/30 00:01,['1998/12/30 00:00'],"['1998/12/30 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/12/30 00:01 [medline]', '1998/12/30 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0360-3016(98)00344-7 [pii]', '10.1016/s0360-3016(98)00344-7 [doi]']",ppublish,Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 1998 Dec 1;42(5):1113-7. doi: 10.1016/s0360-3016(98)00344-7.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

HTLV-I infection was screened by an enzyme immunossay (ELISA) test and all repeatedly positive or indeterminate ELISA samples were further tested by a Western-Blot (WB) technique. Indeterminate and inconclusive WB samples were confirmed by a polymerase chain reaction (PCR). ELISA results showed that 40 (60.6%) individuals were not infected; 16 (24.2%) were positive; and 10 (15.2%) were undetermined. Among 16 ELISA positive subjects, 14 (87.5%) were confirmed to be positive by WB while 2 (12.5%) showed inconclusive results. Based on the laboratory data, questionnaire analysis, and family/epidemiological studies, we concluded that HTLV-I vertical transmission occurred in 6 of the 13 families. In 3 of these 6 families, the horizontal transmission also could be demonstrated. An isolated horizontal transmission was detected in one family, and in 6 families we did not find any infected family member. All HTLV-I-infected persons were clinically asymptomatic. The occurrence of an effective HTLV-I vertical transmission detected by the present study suggest that HTLV-I infection is endemic in the Southeast region of Brazil. Consistent with the modes of transmission, the HTLV-I antibody seroprevalence was greater in relatives of ATL patients than in the general blood donor Brazilian population (0.4%). In addition, the present data suggest that HTLV-I carries a high infectivity rate but a low virulence.","['Borducchi, D M', 'Oliveira, J S', 'Bordin, J O', 'Kerbauy, J']","['Borducchi DM', 'Oliveira JS', 'Bordin JO', 'Kerbauy J']","['The Hematology and Transfusion Medicine Service-Universidade Federal de Sao Paulo, Escola Paulista de Medicina, Brazil.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Brazil/epidemiology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'HTLV-I Infections/epidemiology/genetics/*transmission', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*isolation & purification', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/genetics/*virology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Pedigree']",1998/12/30 00:00,1998/12/30 00:01,['1998/12/30 00:00'],"['1998/12/30 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/12/30 00:01 [medline]', '1998/12/30 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.3109/10428199809059235 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 1998 Oct;31(3-4):411-6. doi: 10.3109/10428199809059235.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These data are part of the Leukaemia Research Fund's specialist Data Collection Study, which is the only large, population-based data set of its type in Europe. The age specific incidence curves showed different patterns for nodular sclerosis contrasted with all other subtypes combined (non-nodular sclerosis). For nodular sclerosis, there was a female excess for young adults, while for non-nodular sclerosis a gradual rise in incidence with age in both sexes was observed. Incidence varied over time, showing a complex pattern with a decreasing trend in males in all Rye-subtypes and no significant change among females diagnosed with nodular sclerosis. These complex patterns of change are different from those seen in other countries. It is concluded that the results provide clear evidence of the heterogeneity of Hodgkin's disease between the sexes and between subtypes, which should be taken into account in future studies.","['Cartwright, R', 'McNally, R', 'Roman, E', 'Simpson, J', 'Thomas, J']","['Cartwright R', 'McNally R', 'Roman E', 'Simpson J', 'Thomas J']","['Leukaemia Research Fund Centre for Clinical Epidemiology, Leeds.

Forty-nine patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML: 30 patients) or acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL: 19 patients) were included. Median age was 30 years (range: 4-71). Four patients were treated for primary refractory disease and 45 for relapsed disease (16 patients > 2nd relapse). Twenty-four patients (49%) had previously received bone marrow transplantation (allogeneic: 5, autologous: 19). Patients were scheduled to receive three 5-day cycles of rIL-2 given every other week. rIL-2 was administered as bolus I.V. infusion of 8 x 10(6) UI/m2 every 8 hours during cycle I and every 12 hours during cycles 2 and 3. Patients received a mean of 76% of rIL-2 planned dose. Main toxicity was hematologic (grade IV thrombopenia: 84%). Hemodynamic and metabolic toxicities lead to treatment discontinuation in 10 patients (20%). Strong immune activation was achieved including a significant increase in activated T-cells and Lymphokine-Activating-Killer cell (LAK) activity. Twenty-seven out of 30 AML patients could be evaluated for response: 2(7%) achieved complete remission (CR) which lasted 3 and 4 months. No response was observed in the 18 assessable ALL patients, most of whom (77 %) presented absolute drug resistance. These results show that this high dose rIL-2 regimen induces significant biological effects and provides some anti-leukemic activity in patients with advanced leukemia. Considering the severe toxicity observed and the limited remission rate achieved here, rIL-2 does not appear to be a valuable therapeutic option for such patients. However, the undoubted anti-leukemic activity of this cytokine invites further investigation especially in the minimal residual disease situation.","['Maraninchi, D', 'Vey, N', 'Viens, P', 'Stoppa, A M', 'Archimbaud, E', 'Attal, M', 'Baume, D', 'Bouabdallah, R', 'Demeoq, F', 'Fleury, J', 'Michallet, M', 'Olive, D', 'Reiffers, J', 'Sainty, D', 'Tabilio, A', 'Tiberghien, P', 'Brandely, M', 'Hercend, T', 'Blaise, D']","['Maraninchi D', 'Vey N', 'Viens P', 'Stoppa AM', 'Archimbaud E', 'Attal M', 'Baume D', 'Bouabdallah R', 'Demeoq F', 'Fleury J', 'Michallet M', 'Olive D', 'Reiffers J', 'Sainty D', 'Tabilio A', 'Tiberghien P', 'Brandely M', 'Hercend T', 'Blaise D']","['Institut Paoli-Calmettes and INSERM Unit 119, Marseille, France.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Clinical Trial, Phase II', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,"['0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infusions, Intravenous', 'Interleukin-2/*administration & dosage', 'Killer Cells, Lymphokine-Activated/immunology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*drug therapy/immunology/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/immunology/pathology', 'Recombinant Proteins/administration & dosage', 'Recurrence', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology']",1998/12/30 00:00,1998/12/30 00:01,['1998/12/30 00:00'],"['1998/12/30 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/12/30 00:01 [medline]', '1998/12/30 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.3109/10428199809059227 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 1998 Oct;31(3-4):343-9. doi: 10.3109/10428199809059227.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recently, immunologic effector cells termed cytokine-induced killer (CIK) cells have been shown to be more useful than LAK cells for purging of autologous BM in the context of autologous BMT. Here, we show that the expression of bcr/abl in CIK cells generated from patients with CML correlates with progression of disease in individual patients. In addition, progression of disease from chronic phase to accelerated phase could be predicted in two patients by studying the expression of bcr/abl in CIK cells generated from CML patients.

Emerging data suggest that accepted therapies for patients who relapse such as interferon and donor lymphocyte infusions may be more efficacious and potentially less toxic if given to patients with minimal disease burdens. The effective application of this strategy may therefore be dependent on the early detection of relapse posttransplant using sensitive assays such as the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for the presence of the bcr/abl transcript. To that end, we have been interested in determining the predictive value of PCR for subsequent relapse in unrelated marrow transplants for CML.

We summarize here historical landmarks in the establishment of unique leukemia-lymphoma-derived cell lines from the various cell lineages; their special importance in hematopoietic research is emphasized. The first cell lines were derived from African Burkitt lymphomas and were found to integrate the Epstein-Barr virus in their genome leading to the discovery and isolation of this virus. However, it was later recognized that not every cell line derived from a patient with leukemia-lymphoma represents a malignant cell line as residual normal B-lymphocytes can also be immortalized by EBV infection. During the following 20-30 years many other types of hematopoietic cell lines, commonly derived from hematopoietic neoplasms, were established. These panels of cell lines now span almost the whole spectrum of hematopoietic cell lineages (except for dendritric cells) and the various distinct stages of differentiation along the respective cell axes. From early on, cell lines became important tools for basic and clinical hematological research, initially mainly in the field of immunology, but later expanding to other areas also. It became apparent that leukemia-lymphoma cell lines are of monoclonal origin, are arrested at a discrete maturational stage during differentiation in each lineage, and show sustained and growth factor-independent or -dependent unlimited proliferation. Categorization of cell lines might best be based on the physiological stages of hematopoietic differentiation in the various cell lineages. For an adequate classification, detailed characterizations of both the cell lines and the primary cells from which the cell lines originated are absolutely mandatory. In summary, the availability of large numbers of continuous leukemia-lymphoma cell lines has greatly facilitated clinical and immunobiological studies of normal and malignant hematopoiesis. Human leukemia-lymphoma cell lines will continue to provide exquisite model systems for many biomedical disciplines.","['Drexler, H G', 'Minowada, J']","['Drexler HG', 'Minowada J']","['DSMZ-German Collection of Microorganisms & Cell Cultures Dept. of Human and Animal Cell Cultures, Braunschweig. hdr@gbf.de']",['eng'],"['Historical Article', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,,IM,"['History, 20th Century', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/history/*pathology', 'Lymphoma/history/*pathology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/*classification']",1998/12/30 00:00,1998/12/30 00:01,['1998/12/30 00:00'],"['1998/12/30 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/12/30 00:01 [medline]', '1998/12/30 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.3109/10428199809059223 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 1998 Oct;31(3-4):305-16. doi: 10.3109/10428199809059223.,,,,128,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recent studies demonstrated that G-CSF induces growth of some malignant cells, including lymphoid cells. G-CSF is now widely and successfully used to treat neutropenia induced by intensive chemotherapy, and the responsive growth of malignant cells becomes a major clinical issue. Adult T-cell leukemia (ATL) is a malignant lymphoid disease of T cells, etiologically associated with human T cell lymphotropic virus type I (HTLV-I). We demonstrated that primary ATL cells in about 80% of patients expressed cell surface G-CSF receptor (G-CSFR). Our recent data also show that ATL cells from a third of the patients show responsive growth to G-CSF ex vivo. Several patients whose ATL cells proliferated in response to G-CSF showed a significant increase of the ATL cell count after administration of G-CSF in vivo. These observations suggest caution for it's routine clinical use in ATL. The molecular mechanism of G-CSF responsive growth of ATL cells is obscure, however the population of G-CSFR expressing cells is larger in responsive cases than in nonresponsive cases. Expression of G-CSFR on ATL cells may relate to the expression of Tax protein encoded by HTLV-I. Precise studies on G-CSFR signaling in ATL cells are necessary for the safe use of G-CSF routinely for ATL patients.","['Matsushita, K', 'Arima, N']","['Matsushita K', 'Arima N']","['First Department of Internal Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Kagoshima University, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,['143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)'],IM,"['Adult', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/*pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/*drug therapy/*pathology']",1998/12/30 00:00,1998/12/30 00:01,['1998/12/30 00:00'],"['1998/12/30 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/12/30 00:01 [medline]', '1998/12/30 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.3109/10428199809059222 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 1998 Oct;31(3-4):295-304. doi: 10.3109/10428199809059222.,,,,94,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this review we summarize some of the basic mechanisms underlying the action of vitamin D compounds. A variety of vitamin D analogues were synthesized until now, some of which have enhanced antileukemic activity and a decreased propensity to cause hypercalcemia. Most actions of vitamin D compounds are mediated by nuclear receptors. In vivo, vitamin D binding protein interacts with free vitamin D compounds. Both in normal and leukemic cells, vitamin D compounds cause a differentiation to monocytes and macrophages. A variety of genes are regulated by vitamin D compounds. Recently, the cell cycle inhibitory gene p21/WAF-1/CIP-1 was characterized. The expression de novo of WAF-1 in blasts of acute myelogenous leukemia is an independent factor of unfavorable prognosis. In HL-60 leukemic cells treated with vitamin D analogs, WAF-1 can be induced by nano- or picomolar concentrations of vitamin D analogs and correlates with the induction of a differentiated phenotype. When vitamin D analogs are combined in-vitro with retinoids, an irreversible differentiation is observed. Clinical trials of vitamin D analogs are indicated in the situation of minimal residual disease and in combination with standard chemotherapy.","['Munker, R', 'Zhang, W', 'Elstner, E', 'Koeffler, H P']","['Munker R', 'Zhang W', 'Elstner E', 'Koeffler HP']","['Medizinische Klinik III der LMU (Klinikum Grosshadern) Munich, Germany. munker@gsf.de']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,"['0 (CDKN1A protein, human)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21)', '0 (Cyclins)', '1406-16-2 (Vitamin D)']",IM,"['Cell Differentiation/drug effects/genetics', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21', 'Cyclins/*genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy/*genetics/pathology', 'Vitamin D/analogs & derivatives/*pharmacology/therapeutic use']",1998/12/30 00:00,1998/12/30 00:01,['1998/12/30 00:00'],"['1998/12/30 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/12/30 00:01 [medline]', '1998/12/30 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.3109/10428199809059220 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 1998 Oct;31(3-4):279-84. doi: 10.3109/10428199809059220.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Classification of the chronic myeloid processes is based primarily on the presence or absence of the Philadelphia chromosome (bcr-abl translocation) and secondarily on the morphologic picture of the bone marrow in conjunction with the clinical manifestation. Essential thrombocythemia (ET), polycythemia vera (PV), and agnogenic myeloid metaplasia (AMM) constitute the classical group of bcr-abl negative chronic myeloproliferative disorders. PV is characterized by a clonal increase in red blood cell mass, AMM by bone marrow fibrosis, and ET by thrombocytosis. Most of these features, however, are not diagnostically specific, and secondary causes of erythrocytosis, thrombocytosis, and bone marrow fibrosis must be excluded. Treatment may be deferred or limited to phlebotomy alone in some patients with ET or PV, respectively. In contrast, thrombosisprone patients with PV or ET require drug therapy, and new platelet-lowering agents are increasingly being used.

However, for massive splenomegaly there have been few reports of the use of this technique and its safety has not been confirmed. We performed laparoscopic splenectomy for massive splenomegaly with transarterial embolization of the splenic artery before surgery. A 37-year-old man underwent splenectomy due to the lack of effect of an approximately 4-month course of chemotherapy for chronic myeloid leukemia whose spleen was over 20 cm in length. Before surgery, splenic artery embolization was performed to prevent intraoperative bleeding and to debulk the spleen. Under general anesthesia the patient was positioned in the lateral decubitus position lying on the right side. There was no bleeding from the capsule of the spleen throughout the procedure and no intraoperative complications occurred. Blood loss was 100 ml, and the weight of the resected spleen was 1,100 g. The postoperative course was uneventful. We conclude that laparoscopic splenectomy is safe and feasible in cases of splenomegaly, when combined with preoperative embolization of the splenic artery.","['Kobayashi, S', 'Sekimoto, M', 'Tomita, N', 'Monden, M']","['Kobayashi S', 'Sekimoto M', 'Tomita N', 'Monden M']","['Department of Surgery, Osaka Medical Center for Cancer and Cardiovascular Disease, Japan.']",['jpn'],"['Case Reports', 'English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Japan,Nihon Geka Gakkai Zasshi,Nihon Geka Gakkai zasshi,0405405,,IM,"['Adult', '*Embolization, Therapeutic', 'Humans', 'Laparoscopy/*methods', 'Male', 'Splenectomy/*methods', 'Splenic Artery', 'Splenomegaly/*therapy']",1998/12/29 00:00,1998/12/29 00:01,['1998/12/29 00:00'],"['1998/12/29 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/12/29 00:01 [medline]', '1998/12/29 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Nihon Geka Gakkai Zasshi. 1998 Oct;99(10):733-6.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A 160-kDa protein band was acid-hydrolyzed in the vapor phase (6 N HC1) and converted to 6-aminoquinolyl-carbamyl (AQC)-amino acids without extraction of the amino acids from the membrane. The amino acid composition of the protein was determined using the sensitive AQC-amino acid analysis method, improving our previously described method. The improved method involved using a Cosmosil 5C8-MS column instead of a Pegasil C8; replacement of the mobile phase A, constituent, 75 mM ammonium phosphate (pH 7.5), with 30 mM sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.2); and slight modification of the separation program (9). All manipulations for protein hydrolysis and AQC derivatization were carried out in a hood using clean tools. This minimized contamination of amino acids at the low femtomolar level. A database search was carried out with bovine serum albumin as a calibration protein. MDR1 in P388/DOX was ranked first by both databases with high reliability (score 14 for ExPASy, distance 1.34 for EMBL).","['Shindo, N', 'Fujimura, T', 'Nojima-Kazuno, S', 'Mineki, R', 'Furusawa, S', 'Sasaki, K', 'Murayama, K']","['Shindo N', 'Fujimura T', 'Nojima-Kazuno S', 'Mineki R', 'Furusawa S', 'Sasaki K', 'Murayama K']","['Division of Biochemical Analysis, Juntendo University School of Medicine, Tokyo, Japan. shindon@med.juntendo.ac.jp']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Anal Biochem,Analytical biochemistry,0370535,"['0 (6-aminoquinolyl-N-hydroxysuccinimidyl carbamate)', '0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Amino Acids)', '0 (Aminoquinolines)', '0 (Carbamates)', '0 (Membranes, Artificial)', '0 (Polyvinyls)', '24937-79-9 (polyvinylidene fluoride)', '27432CM55Q (Serum Albumin, Bovine)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/*chemistry/isolation & purification', 'Amino Acids/*analysis', 'Aminoquinolines', 'Animals', 'Calibration', 'Carbamates', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Databases, Factual', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'Hydrolysis', '*Internet', 'Leukemia P388', 'Membranes, Artificial', 'Mice', 'Molecular Weight', 'Polyvinyls', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', '*Sequence Homology, Amino Acid', 'Serum Albumin, Bovine', 'Specimen Handling', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1998/12/29 00:00,1998/12/29 00:01,['1998/12/29 00:00'],"['1998/12/29 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/12/29 00:01 [medline]', '1998/12/29 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0003269798928536 [pii]', '10.1006/abio.1998.2853 [doi]']",ppublish,Anal Biochem. 1998 Nov 15;264(2):251-8. doi: 10.1006/abio.1998.2853.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In particular, the incidence rate for astrocytoma in boys was significantly elevated. Childhood cancer incidence, particularly brain tumors, has increased in the eight-county region from 1969 to 1994. This analysis demonstrated the Minnesota's childhood cancer incidence patterns are similar to national patterns.","['Swensen, A R', 'Bushhouse, S A']","['Swensen AR', 'Bushhouse SA']","['Minnesota Cancer Surveillance System, Minnesota Department of Health, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Minn Med,Minnesota medicine,8000173,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Brain Neoplasms/epidemiology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Infant', 'Leukemia/*epidemiology', 'Male', 'Minnesota/epidemiology', 'Neoplasms/*epidemiology', '*Population Surveillance']",1998/12/29 00:00,1998/12/29 00:01,['1998/12/29 00:00'],"['1998/12/29 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/12/29 00:01 [medline]', '1998/12/29 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Minn Med. 1998 Dec;81(12):27-32.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

GvL and GvH were compared in an animal tumor model system after the systemic transfer of allogeneic antitumor immune T lymphocytes from B10.D2 [H-2d; minor lymphocyte-stimulating antigen (Mls)b] mice into ESb-MP tumor-bearing or normal DBA/2 (H-2d; Mls(a)) mice. Here we demonstrate that this T-cell-mediated therapy involves the formation of clusters of donor CD4 and CD8 T cells with host macrophages, in particular, with a subpopulation expressing the lymphocyte adhesion molecule sialoadhesin. DBA/2 mice and the derived tumor ESb-MP express viral superantigen 7 (Mls(a)), an endogenous viral superantigen that is absent from B10.D2 mice. To test the contribution of viral superantigen 7-reactive Vbeta6 donor T cells in the GvL-mediated eradication of liver metastases, we performed immunohistological and transmission electron microscopy studies. Vbeta6+ CD4 and CD8 T cells from B10.D2 donors formed tight clusters with host sialoadhesin-positive macrophages, and transmission electron microscopy pictures revealed direct membrane-membrane interactions between T cells and macrophages. Clusters were more abundant and consisted of more cells in tumor-bearing hosts (GvL model) than in non-tumor-bearing hosts (GvH model). In addition, Vbeta6 T cells within the clusters showed a strong proliferation activity, indicating stimulation. Moreover, in an in vitro tumor cytostasis assay, primed as well as nonprimed purified Vbeta6 T cells from donor mice were able to inhibit the proliferation of superantigen-expressing ESb-MP lymphoma cells. This suggests that the transferred superantigen-reactive Vbeta6 T cells contribute to the eradication of metastases. The observed cell clusters might be sites for antigen presentation and the activation of tumor-reactive T cells.","['Muerkoster, S', 'Wachowski, O', 'Zerban, H', 'Schirrmacher, V', 'Umansky, V', 'Rocha, M']","['Muerkoster S', 'Wachowski O', 'Zerban H', 'Schirrmacher V', 'Umansky V', 'Rocha M']","['Deutsches Krebsforschungszentrum, Abteilung Zellulare Immunologie, FSP Tummorimmunologie, Heidelberg, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, alpha-beta)', '0 (Superantigens)', '0 (T cell receptor Vbeta6.7a, human)']",IM,"['Animals', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Cell Division', 'Cytokines/biosynthesis', 'Graft vs Host Disease/pathology', '*Graft vs Tumor Effect', 'Immunotherapy, Adoptive', 'Liver Neoplasms/secondary', 'Lymphoma/pathology', 'Macrophages/*immunology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred DBA', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, alpha-beta/immunology', 'Spleen/metabolism', 'Superantigens/*immunology/metabolism', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology/transplantation']",1998/12/29 00:00,1998/12/29 00:01,['1998/12/29 00:00'],"['1998/12/29 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/12/29 00:01 [medline]', '1998/12/29 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 1998 Dec;4(12):3095-106.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The AML1/ETO fusion protein, created by translocations between chromosomes 8 and 21 [t(8;21); G. Nucifora and J. D. Rowley, Leuk. Lymphoma, 14: 353-362, 1994; K. L. Rhoades et al., Proc. Natl. Acad.

However, we show that primary AML cells with (8;21) chromosomal translocations generally express low levels of Bcl-2 protein relative to normal bone marrow-derived myeloid cells and to AML samples with other simple karyotypic abnormalities. We note that p53 mutations are present in the myeloid cell lines expressing AML-ETO protein from chromosomal translocations (Kasumi and SKNO) or from transfected fusion genes (U937) but were undetected in our analyses of 28 primary t(8;21)-bearing AML cell samples from de novo AMLs. Because wild-type p53 can transcriptionally down-regulate bcl-2, we speculate that p53 mutations may contribute to the association of t(8;21) chromosomal abnormalities with higher Bcl-2 expression levels in leukemia cell lines. We also note that some t(8;21)-bearing samples from pediatric and older adult patients do express somewhat higher levels of Bcl-2 than t(8;21)-bearing samples from young adult patients. This suggests that Bcl-2 overexpression could occur in these AML cells by an as yet undefined, p53-independent mechanism and could contribute to the reported association of t(8;21) karyotypes with poor clinical outcomes in childhood AML patients and/or to typically poor clinical outcomes in elderly AML patients.","['Banker, D E', 'Radich, J', 'Becker, A', 'Kerkof, K', 'Norwood, T', 'Willman, C', 'Appelbaum, F R']","['Banker DE', 'Radich J', 'Becker A', 'Kerkof K', 'Norwood T', 'Willman C', 'Appelbaum FR']","['Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, Washington 98104, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,"['0 (Proliferating Cell Nuclear Antigen)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Blotting, Western', 'Bone Marrow/metabolism', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 21', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 8', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Gene Expression', 'Humans', 'Immunoassay', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*genetics', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/metabolism', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation', 'Proliferating Cell Nuclear Antigen/analysis', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Reproducibility of Results', '*Translocation, Genetic', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/genetics']",1998/12/29 00:00,1998/12/29 00:01,['1998/12/29 00:00'],"['1998/12/29 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/12/29 00:01 [medline]', '1998/12/29 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 1998 Dec;4(12):3051-62.,"['CA18029/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA18105/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'UOI CA32102/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here we demonstrate that calphostin C induces dose-dependent apoptosis in DT40 chicken lymphoma B-cells, and targeted disruption of lyn, syk, btk, PLCgamma2, or IP3R genes does not prevent or attenuate its cytotoxicity. In our study, calphostin C also induced rapid apoptosis in human acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) cell lines ALL-1 (BCR-ABL+ pre-pre-B ALL), RS4;11 (MLL-AF4+ pro-B ALL), NALM-6 (pre-B ALL), DAUDI (Burkitt's/B-cell ALL), MOLT-3 (T-ALL), and JURKAT (T-ALL), whereas other potent PKC inhibitors did not. In biochemical studies, calphostin C was discovered to induce rapid calcium mobilization from intracellular stores of ALL cell lines, and its cytotoxicity against ALL cell lines was well correlated with the magnitude of this calcium signal. Calphostin C-induced apoptosis was markedly suppressed by BAPTA/AM, a cell-permeable Ca2+ chelator as well as NiCl2, an inhibitor of Ca2+/Mg2+-dependent endonucleases. Inhibition of the Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent phosphatase calcineurin with perfluoreperazine dimadeate (a calmodulin antagonist) or cyclosporin A (a specific inhibitor of calcineurin) also reduced the magnitude of calphostin C-induced apoptosis in ALL cell lines. Calphostin C was capable of inducing calcium mobilization and apoptosis in freshly obtained primary leukemic cells from children with ALL. Taken together, our results provide unprecedented evidence that calphostin C triggers a Ca2+-dependent apoptotic signal in human ALL cells.","['Zhu, D M', 'Narla, R K', 'Fang, W H', 'Chia, N C', 'Uckun, F M']","['Zhu DM', 'Narla RK', 'Fang WH', 'Chia NC', 'Uckun FM']","['Department of Immunology, Parker Hughes Cancer Center, Roseville, Minnesota 55113, USA.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,"['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Naphthalenes)', 'I271P23G24 (calphostin C)']",IM,"['Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/*pharmacology', '*Apoptosis', 'Biological Transport/drug effects', 'Calcium Signaling/*drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Child', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/pathology', 'Naphthalenes/*pharmacology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1998/12/29 00:00,1998/12/29 00:01,['1998/12/29 00:00'],"['1998/12/29 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/12/29 00:01 [medline]', '1998/12/29 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 1998 Dec;4(12):2967-76.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the morphologic characteristics and function of a proposed cerebellar-frontal subsystem in children treated for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) with intrathecal methotrexate using quantitative magnetic resonance imaging, neuropsychological measures, nonlinear multiple regression analysis, and a statistical effect size model that augments interpretive validity of nonsignificant statistical findings, particularly from small sample size studies. DESIGN: Comparison and relationship of magnetic resonance imaging morphometry of cerebellar lobuli I-V and VI-VII and prefrontal cortices, and performance on 5 neuropsychological tests assessing visual-spatial attention, short-term memory, and visuomotor organization and coordination between childhood survivors of ALL and a matched control group. PARTICIPANTS: Ten childhood survivors of ALL treated between 1982 and 1989 with standard 3-year intrathecal chemotherapy, and matched control subjects. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Morphometric results of cerebellar lobuli I-V and VI-VII and prefrontal cortices, and results of Trail-Making Tests, Rey-Osterreith Complex Figure Test, WISC-III Coding. RESULTS: Significant effect size model values for outcome measures in the ALL group support deficits in lobuli VI-VII and prefrontal cortices, and neuropsychological performance. Multiple regression analysis results were consistent with hypothesized involvement of a cerebellar-frontal brain subsystem. CONCLUSION: Treatment of children with ALL with intrathecal methotrexate before 5 years of age has structural and functional effects on the developing neocerebellar-frontal subsystem.","['Lesnik, P G', 'Ciesielski, K T', 'Hart, B L', 'Benzel, E C', 'Sanders, J A']","['Lesnik PG', 'Ciesielski KT', 'Hart BL', 'Benzel EC', 'Sanders JA']","['Department of Psychology, The University of New Mexico, Albuquerque 87131, USA. lesnik@unm.edu']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Arch Neurol,Archives of neurology,0372436,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Anthropometry', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/administration & dosage/*adverse effects', 'Cerebellum/abnormalities/drug effects/*growth & development', 'Child', 'Cognition/drug effects', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Frontal Lobe/abnormalities/drug effects/*growth & development', 'Humans', 'Injections, Spinal', 'Male', 'Methotrexate/administration & dosage/*adverse effects', 'Neuropsychological Tests', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy']",1998/12/29 00:00,1998/12/29 00:01,['1998/12/29 00:00'],"['1998/12/29 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/12/29 00:01 [medline]', '1998/12/29 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1001/archneur.55.12.1561 [doi]'],ppublish,Arch Neurol. 1998 Dec;55(12):1561-8. doi: 10.1001/archneur.55.12.1561.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The anti-leukemia effect is not exerted through complement-mediated lysis or through direct growth-inhibitory signaling after binding of antibody to the CD7 molecule on the T-ALL cell surface but rather through antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC). Thus, the in vivo depletion of SCID mice of their natural killer cells almost completely abolishes the therapeutic effect of native HB2 anti-CD7 antibody and moreover significantly reduces the in vivo therapeutic performance of the anti-CD7 HB2-SAPORIN IT. Furthermore, an IT constructed with the F(ab')2 fragment of the same anti-CD7 antibody (HB2-F(ab')2-SAPORIN), which is incapable of recruiting natural killer cells, performed significantly less well therapeutically than HB2-SAPORIN IT. There was also a significant improvement in the therapeutic performance of the HB2-F(ab')2-SAPORIN IT in SCID-HSB-2 mice when used in combination with intact HB2 antibody, presumably through restoration of an ADCC attack on the target HSB-2 cell. These combined data indicate that ADCC in the SCID mouse does contribute additively together with toxin to the in vivo therapeutic potency of the HB2-SAPORIN IT directed against this human T-ALL cell line and that this has potentially important implications for the utility of this and other related classes of immunotherapeutic in human therapy.","['Flavell, D J', 'Warnes, S', 'Noss, A', 'Flavell, S U']","['Flavell DJ', 'Warnes S', 'Noss A', 'Flavell SU']","['The Simon Flavell Leukaemia Research Unit, University Pathology, Southampton General Hospital, Hampshire, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Antibodies)', '0 (Antigens, CD7)', '0 (Immunoconjugates)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Fab Fragments)', '0 (Immunotoxins)', '0 (Plant Proteins)', '0 (Protein Synthesis Inhibitors)', '0 (Ribosome Inactivating Proteins, Type 1)', 'EC 3.2.2.- (N-Glycosyl Hydrolases)', 'EC 3.2.2.22 (Saporins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies/metabolism', '*Antibody-Dependent Cell Cytotoxicity', 'Antigens, CD7/*immunology', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Immunoconjugates/*therapeutic use', 'Immunoglobulin Fab Fragments/pharmacology', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Immunotoxins/*administration & dosage', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*therapy', 'Mice', 'Mice, SCID', '*N-Glycosyl Hydrolases', 'Plant Proteins/*administration & dosage', 'Protein Synthesis Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Ribosome Inactivating Proteins, Type 1', 'Saporins', 'Spleen/cytology']",1998/12/29 00:00,1998/12/29 00:01,['1998/12/29 00:00'],"['1998/12/29 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/12/29 00:01 [medline]', '1998/12/29 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1998 Dec 15;58(24):5787-94.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To test this hypothesis, we used quantitative reverse transcription-PCR and fast performance liquid chromatography procedures to examine the levels of CRABP-II mRNA and RA binding activity in APL patient samples. We found that CRABP-II mRNA in APL cells from pretreatment patients (n = 36) was constitutively expressed at relatively high levels (median, 0.92; range, 0.16-4.13) relative to the level in CRABP-H protein-expressing NB4 cells (arbitrarily set at 1.0 unit). Consistent with this finding, the RA binding activity of CRABP in APL cells from three pretreatment cases (range, 27.2-53.2 fmol/mg protein) was similar to that of NB4 cells (22.6 +/- 5.4 fmol/mg protein). Furthermore, in the pretreatment samples, there was no association between CRABP-H mRNA expression level and APL cellular sensitivity to RA-induced differentiation in vitro. After 45 days of remission induction therapy on Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group protocol E2491, CRABP-II mRNA was modestly increased from day 0 values in patients treated with either RA (median increase, 0.41) or chemotherapy (median increase, 0.56), and there was no significant difference between the two treatment groups (P = 0.91). In patients studied after relapse from RA therapy (n = 7), there was a significant decline in APL cell sensitivity to RA-induced differentiation in vitro compared with patients after relapse from chemotherapy (n = 5; P = 0.015-0.055 at three RA concentrations tested), but in the RA relapse cases, there was no change from pretreatment levels of CRABP-II mRNA (median, 0.98) or, in three relapse cases studied, of RA protein binding activity (range, 22.1-70.7 fmol/mg protein). Taken together, our data strongly imply that variations in CRABP-II expression and RA binding activity are not causally related to the development of clinically acquired APL cellular RA resistance, but rather, they suggest that constitutive expression of CRABP-II could have a facilitative role in the response of APL cells to RA.","['Zhou, D C', 'Hallam, S J', 'Lee, S J', 'Klein, R S', 'Wiernik, P H', 'Tallman, M S', 'Gallagher, R E']","['Zhou DC', 'Hallam SJ', 'Lee SJ', 'Klein RS', 'Wiernik PH', 'Tallman MS', 'Gallagher RE']","['Department of Oncology, Montefiore Medical Center and Albert Einstein Cancer Center, Bronx, New York 10467, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Retinoic Acid)', '0 (retinoic acid binding protein II, cellular)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)']",IM,"['Cell Differentiation', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*drug therapy/*metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Receptors, Retinoic Acid/*metabolism', 'Remission Induction', 'Tretinoin/metabolism/*therapeutic use']",1998/12/29 00:00,1998/12/29 00:01,['1998/12/29 00:00'],"['1998/12/29 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/12/29 00:01 [medline]', '1998/12/29 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1998 Dec 15;58(24):5770-6.,['CA 56771/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recent preliminary molecular analyses found IGH rearrangements in almost 100% of human myeloma cell lines and in 75% of patients. However, no systematic study analyzing the nature of the partner chromosomal regions have been reported thus far. To define the exact incidence of illegitimate IGH rearrangements and the respective incidence of partner genes cloned to date, we analyzed 141 patients with either multiple myeloma (MM, n = 127) or primary plasma cell leukemia (PCL, n = 14) using fluorescence in situ hybridization. The overall incidence of illegitimate recombinations was 57% (80 of 141 patients). Analysis of this incidence according to Durie and Salmon stage, patients' status, i.e., MM versus primary PCL and diagnosis versus relapse, immunoglobulin type and subtype, and beta2-microglobulin value, did not show any correlation. To analyze the nature of the partner chromosomal region, we selected probes specific for the following genes: FGFR3 (4p16), MYC (8q24), CCND1 (11q13), MAF (16q23), and BCL2 (18q21). These probes, combined with differentially labeled 14q32 probes, were used for dual-color fluorescence in situ hybridization on interphase plasma cells. Among the 80 patients with illegitimate IGH rearrangement, we identified 23 IGH-CCND1 fusion cases [i.e., t(11;14)], 17 IGH-FGFR3 fusion cases [i.e., t(4;14)], 3 IGH-MYC fusion cases [i.e., t(8;14)], and only one IGH-MAF fusion case. No IGH-BCL2 fusion case was detected. In 37 of 80 patients, none of these partner genes was involved. Analysis of cases with specific translocations according to their bioclinical features at diagnosis did not show any correlation. This study demonstrated that CCND1 and FGFR3 genes are involved together in about 50% of MM and primary PCL patients with illegitimate IGH rearrangements.","['Avet-Loiseau, H', 'Li, J Y', 'Facon, T', 'Brigaudeau, C', 'Morineau, N', 'Maloisel, F', 'Rapp, M J', 'Talmant, P', 'Trimoreau, F', 'Jaccard, A', 'Harousseau, J L', 'Bataille, R']","['Avet-Loiseau H', 'Li JY', 'Facon T', 'Brigaudeau C', 'Morineau N', 'Maloisel F', 'Rapp MJ', 'Talmant P', 'Trimoreau F', 'Jaccard A', 'Harousseau JL', 'Bataille R']","[""Laboratoire d'Hematologie, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire, Nantes, France.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,,IM,"['Aneuploidy', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 11', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 14', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 4', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Leukemia, Plasma Cell/*genetics', 'Multiple Myeloma/*genetics', 'Prognosis', '*Translocation, Genetic']",1998/12/29 00:00,1998/12/29 00:01,['1998/12/29 00:00'],"['1998/12/29 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/12/29 00:01 [medline]', '1998/12/29 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1998 Dec 15;58(24):5640-5.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

MATERIALS AND SUBJECTS: In vitro studies were performed using rat basophilic leukemia (RBL-1) cells, human polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNL), COX-1 from ram seminal vesicle, COX-2 from sheep placenta and human venous blood. For the in vivo tests male Wistar rats were used, for the ex vivo test perfused rabbit ears. TREATMENT: 1-300 microg/kg MGL or myricetinmethylglucuronate and 0.1-5 mg/kg other related compounds administered p.o. (carrageenan edema). 5, 50 and 150 microg/kg MGL p.o. for 14 days (Freund's adjuvant arthritis), 5 and 50 microg/kg p.o. for 6 days (ulceration). METHODS: Anti-inflammatory effects were measured in carrageenan edema and in adjuvant arthritis. Incidence of gastric lesions was tested in an ulcerogenicity model in vivo. Influence on COX was determined in the perfused rabbit ear, in PMNL and in a test assay using COX-1 and COX-2. 5-LOX activity was studied using PMNL and RBL-1. The influence on platelet aggregation was evaluated measuring light transmission. RESULTS: MGL exerted a marked and dose-dependent anti-inflammatory effect in acute (carrageenan edema, ED50 15 microg/kg, indomethacin ED50 10 mg/kg) and chronic (adjuvant arthritis, inhibition at 150 microg/kg 18.1 % left paw, 20.6% right paw, indomethacin 3 mg/kg 18.0% and 19.4%)) models of inflammation. In the perfused rabbit ear 1 microg MGL inhibited the release of PGI2, PGD2 and PGE2 to the same extent as 1 microg indomethacin. The inhibition of COX-1 in the intact cell system was IC50 = 0.5 microM, that of indomethacin 0.0038 microM. In the isolated enzyme preparations of COX-1 and COX-2 the IC50 was 10 microM and 8 microM, that of indomethacin 9.2 mM and 2.4 microM. In the RBL-1 and PMNL test assay the inhibition of 5-LOX was 0.1 microM and 2.2 microM. An orally administered dose of 50 microg/kg/day induced no gastric ulcers in rats treated for 6 days. The investigations on carrageenan edema showed a close relationship between the structure of MGL and the anti-inflammatory effect. CONCLUSIONS: MGL is a COX-1, COX-2 and 5-LOX inhibitor. In view of the moderate in vitro activity and the very potent in vivo activity an additive mechanism must be involved. Small changes in the molecular structure lead to the loss or reduction of the anti-inflammatory activity.","['Hiermann, A', 'Schramm, H W', 'Laufer, S']","['Hiermann A', 'Schramm HW', 'Laufer S']","['Institute of Pharmacognosy, University of Graz, Austria. alois.hiermann@kfunigraz.ac.at']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Switzerland,Inflamm Res,Inflammation research : official journal of the European Histamine Research Society ...

However, it is unknown whether specimen age or histological stains alter the accuracy of Taq polymerase or induce secondary mutations in sample DNA. To address this question, we evaluated five methods for extraction of genomic DNA from archival bone marrow slides of 17 leukemia patients and analyzed exons 1 and 2 of the N- and K-ras genes for the presence of mutations. Of the five methods, optimal DNA purification was achieved by boiling and phenol:chloroform extraction. N-and K-ras exons 1 and 2 were independently amplified using 35 cycles of PCR, and 6-12 clones for each exon were isolated and individually sequenced for each patient. Mutations were confirmed by repeat extraction, cloning, and sequencing. Sixteen of 17 patient samples were successfully amplified (94%), including slides up to 29 years old. Twelve slides had been stained with Wright-Giemsa, I stained with toluidine blue, and 4 were unstained. A total of 16 single-base mutations were identified of 33,840 nucleotides sequenced. No insertions or deletions were identified. Six of 16 single-base mutations were previously described activating mutations in codon 13 of N-ras exon 1. The 10 other mutations were in other regions of the N- and K-ras genes and were not reproduced after repeat extraction, cloning, and sequencing. The frequency of these other alterations was I of 3384 bp. This value is comparable with the inherent error frequency for Taq polymerase. Our findings suggest that high fidelity DNA amplification can be achieved using archival hematological slides as old as 29 years and can be reliably used in genetic analyses.","['Boyle, E B', 'Steinbuch, M', 'Tekautz, T', 'Gutman, J R', 'Robison, L L', 'Perentesis, J P']","['Boyle EB', 'Steinbuch M', 'Tekautz T', 'Gutman JR', 'Robison LL', 'Perentesis JP']","['Division of Pediatric Hematology, University of Minnesota Cancer Center, Minneapolis 55455, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev,"Cancer epidemiology, biomarkers & prevention : a publication of the American Association for Cancer Research, cosponsored by the American Society of Preventive Oncology",9200608,"['0 (Genetic Markers)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",IM,"['Archives', '*Bone Marrow', 'Child', 'DNA/*analysis', 'Genetic Markers', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*genetics', 'Pilot Projects', '*Polymerase Chain Reaction/methods', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Time Factors', 'Tissue Preservation']",1998/12/29 00:00,1998/12/29 00:01,['1998/12/29 00:00'],"['1998/12/29 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/12/29 00:01 [medline]', '1998/12/29 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev. 1998 Dec;7(12):1127-31.,['ES078919/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In our report, we describe a population-based survey on nonlymphocytic leukemias in northern Italy, in which 79 patients (acute myelocytic leukemia, myelodysplastic syndromes, or other nonlymphocytic leukemias) were studied before cytotoxic therapy. We found 9 aberrations involving chromosome 8 (six +8, two -8, and one translocation), whereas abnormalities involving chromosomes 5 and 7 occurred with a low frequency compared with previous studies. Aberrations involving chromosome 8 were associated with smoking (odds ratio, 6.3; 95% confidence interval, 0.9-42.3; among smokers of 10 or more cigarettes/day: odds ratio, 14.2; 95% confidence interval, 1.4-142.3); +8 aberrations were found in 1 of 24 nonsmokers and in 5 of 38 smokers. Three +8 aberrations were found in 22 subjects potentially exposed to solvents or polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. The low frequency of chromosome 5 and 7 aberrations in our population-based series (compared with other studies) can be attributed to the recruitment before cytotoxic therapies.

Despite the fact that new drugs specifically targeting AML genetic lesions have not yet been developed, distinct karyotypic categories have been identified which may deserve differentiated treatment. In addition, molecular assays to assess response to therapy more sensitively are now available for several AML subsets. In this review, we discuss the role of genetic characterization in the therapy of AML, and the investigative efforts which we believe are still needed for the design of tailored treatment for each and every patient with this disease. DESIGN AND METHODS: The authors have been working in this field for many years and have contributed original papers, the data of which are incorporated in this article. In addition, the material analyzed in this overview includes articles and reviews covered by the Science Citation Index and Medline as well as some more recent unpublished personal observations. RESULTS: Modern therapeutic approaches to AML tend to differentiate post-induction treatment intensity according to cytogenetically defined risk categories. Such prognostic categorization is largely unsatisfactory. In fact, following the advent of newly developed molecular assays (e.g. RT-PCR and FISH), specific and prognostically relevant lesions are frequently found in patients with an apparently normal karyotype, and these patients are, therefore, re-assigned to more appropriate prognostic categories. In addition, recent studies suggest that some patients may benefit from an increase in induction intensity; rapid genetic characterization will be needed for future differentiation of initial therapy. However, preliminary investigation of AML by integrated karyotypic/molecular analyses show that no specific abnormalities are detectable in at least half of the cases. Therefore, use of genetic criteria for prognostic stratification is currently feasible in only a proportion of patients. INTERPRETATIONS AND CONCLUSIONS: The prognostic role of genetic lesions, currently identified by karyotypic studies, needs to be validated in large series of AML patients prospectively characterized by advanced molecular/cytogenetic analyses and treated uniformly. In addition, searches for new clinically relevant genetic abnormalities, and diagnostic tools for their rapid identification are urgently needed to identify prognostic categories better. Elucidation of AML gene alterations should foster basic investigation aimed at developing new drugs targeted to the specific lesion in the individual patient. Before these more specific therapeutic agents are developed, diagnostic genetic characterization should add to other well-established prognostic factors to optimize the use of the presently available therapies.","['Mandelli, F', 'Petti, M C', 'Lo Coco, F']","['Mandelli F', 'Petti MC', 'Lo Coco F']","['Dipartimento di Biotecnologie Cellulari ed Ematologia, Universita La Sapienza, Rome, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/analysis', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', '*Case Management', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/analysis/genetics', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/classification/diagnosis/*drug therapy/genetics/mortality/therapy', '*Neoplasm Proteins', 'Palliative Care', 'Prognosis', 'Remission Induction', 'Risk', 'Salvage Therapy', 'Transcription Factors/analysis/genetics', 'Treatment Outcome']",1998/12/29 00:00,1998/12/29 00:01,['1998/12/29 00:00'],"['1998/12/29 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/12/29 00:01 [medline]', '1998/12/29 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Haematologica. 1998 Nov;83(11):1015-23.,,,,64,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In 48 patients with de novo acute myeloblastic leukemia (AML) we analyzed the effect of reducing the threshold for prophylactic platelet transfusion from 20,000/microL (group A) to 10,000/microL (group B) after induction and consolidation chemotherapy. DESIGN AND METHODS: Forty-eight adult patients with de novo AML diagnosed in a single institution in a nine year period were enrolled in the study. Between January 1989 and December 1993 the patients received prophylactic platelet transfusions when their platelet count was below 20,000/microL (group A), and from January 1994 to March 1998 prophylactic platelet transfusions were indicated below 10,000/microL or between 10,000/microL and 20,000/microL if there was any consumption factor. RESULTS: The mean number (SD) of platelet transfusions during induction was 8.4 (5.3) in group A and 8.5 (5.5) in group B; and during consolidation 4.7 (3.4) in group A and 4.6 (3.8) in group B (p = n.s.). Excluding the cases with consumption factors from the analysis, group B patients required 34% fewer transfusions during induction and 15.5% fewer during consolidation (p = 0.04). There were no differences between groups regarding major bleeding episodes. INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: Our data show that the threshold for prophylactic platelet transfusion can be safely set at 10,000 microL during induction and consolidation chemotherapy for adult patients with de novo AML.","['Navarro, J T', 'Hernandez, J A', 'Ribera, J M', 'Sancho, J M', 'Oriol, A', 'Pujol, M', 'Milla, F', 'Feliu, E']","['Navarro JT', 'Hernandez JA', 'Ribera JM', 'Sancho JM', 'Oriol A', 'Pujol M', 'Milla F', 'Feliu E']","['Hematology-Hemotherapy Department, Hospital Universitari Germans Trias i Pujol, Badalona, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,"['00DPD30SOY (Amsacrine)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', 'BZ114NVM5P (Mitoxantrone)', 'ZRP63D75JW (Idarubicin)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Amsacrine/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Daunorubicin/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Etoposide/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Hemorrhage/epidemiology/*prevention & control', 'Humans', 'Idarubicin/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/blood/*complications/drug therapy', 'Middle Aged', 'Mitoxantrone/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Pancytopenia/chemically induced', '*Platelet Count', '*Platelet Transfusion/statistics & numerical data', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Spain/epidemiology', 'Thrombocytopenia/chemically induced/*therapy']",1998/12/29 00:00,1998/12/29 00:01,['1998/12/29 00:00'],"['1998/12/29 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/12/29 00:01 [medline]', '1998/12/29 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Haematologica. 1998 Nov;83(11):998-1000.,,['Haematologica. 1998 Nov;83(11):961-2.

The majority of APL patients achieve morphologic remission after induction chemotherapy. They can be followed from this point by cytogenetic and molecular analysis of the persistence of the PML/RAR alpha transcript. In order to determine the influence of successive courses of consolidation chemotherapy on clinical and molecular outcome, APL patients treated with all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) and chemotherapy (AIDA-GIMEMA-LAP0493 protocol) were investigated. DESIGN AND METHODS: Twenty-four APL patients (pts) (15 males; 9 females) were studied by RT-PCR and cytogenetic analysis at diagnosis, after induction chemotherapy, at each point after any of three consolidation courses, and every 3 months during the first years of maintenance therapy. The median follow-up was 24 months (mths) (range 7-40 mths). RESULTS: All pts achieved hematologic remission after induction chemotherapy. Our results demonstrate that the majority (87%) of APL patients were still molecularly positive for the APL associated transcript after induction chemotherapy, while the majority (80%) of APL patients became PCR-after the second consolidation chemotherapy. INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: The role of the third consolidation chemotherapy course in converting patients with persistent molecular evidence of disease from PCR+ to PCR- was minimal. We confirm the validity of molecular follow-up after single courses of chemotherapy in monitoring the role of molecular remission.","['Martinelli, G', 'Ottaviani, E', 'Testoni, N', 'Visani, G', 'Diverio, D', ""D'Elia, G"", 'Mandelli, F', 'Tura, S']","['Martinelli G', 'Ottaviani E', 'Testoni N', 'Visani G', 'Diverio D', ""D'Elia G"", 'Mandelli F', 'Tura S']","['Institute of Hematology and Medical Oncology Seragnoli, University of Bologna, Italy. seragnol@kaiser.alma.unibo.it']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Immunologic Factors)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'ZRP63D75JW (Idarubicin)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*analysis', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Idarubicin/administration & dosage', 'Immunologic Factors/*therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*drug therapy/metabolism/pathology/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm, Residual', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/chemistry/pathology', 'RNA, Messenger/*analysis', 'RNA, Neoplasm/*analysis', 'Remission Induction', 'Tretinoin/*therapeutic use']",1998/12/29 00:00,1998/12/29 00:01,['1998/12/29 00:00'],"['1998/12/29 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/12/29 00:01 [medline]', '1998/12/29 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Haematologica. 1998 Nov;83(11):985-8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Spanish Working Party for BMT in Children (GETMON).,981-4,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: To compare the estimated survival and disease-free survival between children with Ph1-positive chronic myeloid leukemia treated with allogeneic bone marrow transplantation or conventional chemotherapy. DESIGN AND METHODS: In this retrospective study we compared the results obtained in a group of 14 children who received allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (BMT) between 1983 and 1993, and another group of 27 children treated with busulfan, hydroxyurea or alpha-interferon during the same time period. Patients were transplanted at a median of 7 months from diagnosis and all except one were in their first chronic phase. Conditioning consisted in total body irradiation and cyclophosphamide in 12 cases, and busulfan was added in two. RESULTS: Of the 14 patients treated with BMT, two died of transplant-related complications and two relapsed 18 and 48 months after the BMT. Ten children remain alive and disease free at a median follow up of 60 months. The probability of DFS at 5 years is 70%.

IFN-alpha treatment of CML patients impairs malignant cell clone, apparently protecting from progression to terminal blast crisis. The mechanisms underlying this kind of cell deletion are analyzed here by multiple technical approaches. DESIGN AND METHODS: K562 cells, variably treated with IFN-alpha, were examined by agarose gel DNA electrophoresis, light and electron microscopy. The presence of bcr-abl rearrangement was revealed by RT-PCR. RESULTS: At 4 day treatment both DNA ladder and apoptotic nuclear changes were identified, consistently in the presence of bcr-abl expression. INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: Even cells expressing bcr-abl, such as K562, can be triggered to apoptosis. Therefore, this genetic condition, commonly preventing PCD, does not prevent IFN-alpha-mediated apoptosis. PCD seems thus to be the mechanism underlying IFN-alpha-treated K562 cell deletion and it could be the basis of malignant clone reduction in IFN-alpha treated CML patients.","['Luchetti, F', 'Gregorini, A', 'Papa, S', 'Burattini, S', 'Canonico, B', 'Valentini, M', 'Falcieri, E']","['Luchetti F', 'Gregorini A', 'Papa S', 'Burattini S', 'Canonico B', 'Valentini M', 'Falcieri E']","['Istituto di Scienze Morfologiche, Universita di Urbino, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Immunologic Factors)', '0 (Interferon alpha-2)', '0 (Interferon-alpha)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/analysis', 'DNA Fragmentation', 'DNA, Neoplasm/analysis', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/analysis', 'Humans', 'Immunologic Factors/*pharmacology', 'Interferon alpha-2', 'Interferon-alpha/*pharmacology', 'K562 Cells/*drug effects', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/pathology', 'Recombinant Proteins']",1998/12/29 00:00,1998/12/29 00:01,['1998/12/29 00:00'],"['1998/12/29 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/12/29 00:01 [medline]', '1998/12/29 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Haematologica. 1998 Nov;83(11):974-80.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The aim of this study was to assess the independent significance of CD10 expression in a large population of ALL patients. DESIGN AND METHODS: We revised the independent clinical relevance of CD10 expression in 2038 children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), who were consecutively entered in 4 sequential trials of the Italian Association for Pediatric Hematology and Oncology (i.e. AIEOP studies 82, 87, 88, 91); 1142 were males and 896 females, age ranged between 1 and 14 years (yrs) at diagnosis. Of the whole group, 1471 children (72.2%) were defined as having standard risk, 567 (27.8%) as having a high risk. RESULTS: CD10 was detected in blast cells from 1706 of 1784 (95.6%) patients with B-lineage ALL and 46 of 254 (18.1%) with T-cell ALL. In the B-lineage subgroup CD10 expression was associated with presenting features such as age < 9 yrs and inclusion in the standard risk category. No significant differences were found between CD10+ and CD10- cases in T-lineage ALL, concerning presenting features, except for FAB L2 in the former group. We compared the event-free survival (EFS) rates for patients with T-ALL or B-lineage ALL, regarding CD10 positivity, overall and by individual study. Patients with T-ALL fared worse than those with B-lineage ALL (5 and 10 yrs EFS: 46.8% vs. 68.5% and 44.5% vs. 63.7% respectively, p = 0.0001). In multivariate analysis of B-lineage subgroup poorer EFS was associated with male sex, higher WBC (> or = 20 x 10(9)/L), age > 9 yrs. Only WBC > or = 20 x 10(9)/L and age > 9 yrs were parameters linked to poorer EFS in the T-lineage subgroup. Finally, we compared EFS rates for four groups of patients categorized as having high or standard risk, and according to CD10+ and CD10- expression.

RESULTS: Median overall survival exceeds, 72 months (60 months for stage III). Out of 41 relapses, 11 took place after 48 months of follow up. Delayed general complications consisted of 2 chronic nephotoxicities due to CDDP and one leukemia. Local complications are dominated by serous adherences (5 cases of plastic peritonitis).

To test this hypothesis, we sought to identify downstream targets of E2A-HLF in t(17;19)+ pro-B leukemia cells (UOC-B1) that had been transfected with a zinc-inducible vector encoding a dominant-negative suppressor (E2A-HLF[dn]) of the oncoprotein. Representational difference analysis of mRNAs from E2A-HLF(dn)+ UOC-B1 cells grown with (E2A-HLF inactive) or without (E2A-HLF active) the addition of zinc yielded several differentially expressed cDNA fragments that were individually subcloned. Two of the clones, designated F-5 and G-4, hybridized with mRNAs that were upregulated by E2A-HLF. Levels of both transcripts declined sharply within 8 to 12 hours after suppression of E2A-HLF DNA-binding activity, becoming undetectable after 96 hours. The F-5 cDNA was identified as a portion of ANNEXIN VIII, whose product was expressed in promyelocytic leukemia cells and UOC-B1 cells, but not in other leukemic cell lines. A novel full-length cDNA cloned with the G-4 fragment encoded a protein that we have named SRPUL (sushi-repeat protein upregulated in leukemia). It is normally expressed in heart, ovary, and placenta, but could not be detected in leukemic cell lines other than UOC-B1. Neither protein prevented apoptosis in interleukin-3-dependent murine pro-B cells, suggesting that they have paraneoplastic roles in leukemias that express E2A-HLF, perhaps in the disseminated intravascular coagulopathy and hypercalcemia that characterize these cases.","['Kurosawa, H', 'Goi, K', 'Inukai, T', 'Inaba, T', 'Chang, K S', 'Shinjyo, T', 'Rakestraw, K M', 'Naeve, C W', 'Look, A T']","['Kurosawa H', 'Goi K', 'Inukai T', 'Inaba T', 'Chang KS', 'Shinjyo T', 'Rakestraw KM', 'Naeve CW', 'Look AT']","[""Department of Experimental Oncology and the Center for Biotechnology, St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN 38105-2794, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Annexins)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (E2a-Hlf fusion protein, human)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (SRPX2 protein, human)', '0 (Selectins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Annexins/genetics', 'Apoptosis', 'Cell Line', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics', '*Genes, Neoplasm', 'Humans', 'Membrane Proteins/biosynthesis/chemistry/*genetics', 'Molecular Sequence Data', '*Neoplasm Proteins', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*genetics', 'Repetitive Sequences, Amino Acid', 'Selectins/chemistry/genetics', 'Transcription Factors/genetics', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1998/12/24 00:00,1998/12/24 00:01,['1998/12/24 00:00'],"['1998/12/24 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/12/24 00:01 [medline]', '1998/12/24 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)57611-8 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1999 Jan 1;93(1):321-32.,"['CA 21765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 59571/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,['GENBANK/AF060567'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Flow cytometric analysis was used to compare leukemic cell recoveries at the beginning and at the end of 7-day cultures on allogeneic bone marrow-derived stromal layers. The median percentage of cell recovery after culture was 91% (range, <1% to 550%). Among the 25 hyperdiploid cases, only two had cell recoveries above the median value, compared with 63 of 104 cases with different ploidies (P <.001); 21 had recoveries within the first quartile, in contrast to only 12 of the 104 other cases. Cell recoveries in the 16 cases with duplications of chromosomes 4 and 10, a feature previously associated with a superior outcome, were all within the first quartile. Flow cytometric studies indicated that rapid induction of apoptosis was the underlying cause of low cell recoveries in cases with hyperdiploidy. The demise of hyperdiploid cells on stroma was not due to failure to adhere with stromal elements (as shown by electron microscopy) or to deficiencies of interleukin-1 (IL-1), IL-2, IL-3, IL-4, IL-6, IL-7, IL-11, stem-cell factor, interferon- (IFN-), tumor necrosis factor- (TNF-), or to combinations of these cytokines. Inactivation of IL-4, IFN- and TNF-, which if secreted by stromal layers could be toxic to ALL cells, failed to improve the survival of hyperdiploid blasts. We conclude that leukemic cells bearing 51 to 65 chromosomes have a marked propensity to undergo apoptosis. The stringent survival requirements of these cells, together with their potentially higher sensitivity to antileukemic drugs, may well account for the high cure rates achieved in patients with this form of ALL.","['Ito, C', 'Kumagai, M', 'Manabe, A', 'Coustan-Smith, E', 'Raimondi, S C', 'Behm, F G', 'Murti, K G', 'Rubnitz, J E', 'Pui, C H', 'Campana, D']","['Ito C', 'Kumagai M', 'Manabe A', 'Coustan-Smith E', 'Raimondi SC', 'Behm FG', 'Murti KG', 'Rubnitz JE', 'Pui CH', 'Campana D']","[""Departments of Hematology-Oncology, Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, and Virology and Molecular Biology, St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN 38105, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Apoptosis/*genetics', 'Bone Marrow Cells', 'Cell Survival/genetics', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', '*Chromosomes, Human', 'Humans', 'Infant', '*Polyploidy', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics/*pathology', 'Stromal Cells/ultrastructure', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1998/12/24 00:00,1998/12/24 00:01,['1998/12/24 00:00'],"['1998/12/24 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/12/24 00:01 [medline]', '1998/12/24 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)57610-6 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1999 Jan 1;93(1):315-20.,"['CA-20180/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30-CA21765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01-CA58297/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although the genomic organization of the ETV6 gene and a breakpoint cluster region (bcr) in ETV6 intron 5 has been described, mapping of AML1 breakpoints has been hampered because of the large, hitherto unknown size of AML1 intron 1. Here, we report the mapping of the AML1 gene between exons 1 and 3, cloning of ETV6-AML1 breakpoints from different patients, and localization of the AML1 breakpoints within AML1 intron 1. In contrast to the tightly clustered ETV6 breakpoints, the AML1 breakpoints were found to be dispersed throughout AML1 intron 1. Although nucleotide sequence analysis of the breakpoint junctions showed several 5/7 matches for the V(D)J consensus heptamer recognition sequence, these matches were present only on the ETV6 alleles and not on the AML1 alleles, making it unlikely that the translocations were mediated by a simple V(D)J recombination mistake. Interestingly, several breakpoints as well as a stable insertion polymorphism mapped close to a polymorphic, alternating purine-pyrimidine tract in the ETV6 gene, suggesting that this region may be prone to DNA recombination events such as insertions or translocations. Finally, the presence of an insertional polymorphism within the ETV6 bcr must be recognized to avoid incorrect genotype designation based on Southern blot analysis.","['Thandla, S P', 'Ploski, J E', 'Raza-Egilmez, S Z', 'Chhalliyil, P P', 'Block, A W', 'de Jong, P J', 'Aplan, P D']","['Thandla SP', 'Ploski JE', 'Raza-Egilmez SZ', 'Chhalliyil PP', 'Block AW', 'de Jong PJ', 'Aplan PD']","['Departments of Cancer Genetics, Roswell Park Cancer Institute, Buffalo, NY 14263, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (ETS translocation variant 6 protein)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-ets)', '0 (Purines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (RUNX1 protein, human)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/genetics/pathology', 'Chromosome Breakage/*genetics', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics', 'Exons', 'Genes, Neoplasm', 'Genetic Testing', 'Humans', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*genetics', '*Proto-Oncogene Proteins', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-ets', 'Purines/metabolism', 'Pyrimidines/metabolism', 'Repetitive Sequences, Nucleic Acid/*genetics', '*Repressor Proteins', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics', 'Translocation, Genetic/*genetics']",1998/12/24 00:00,1998/12/24 00:01,['1998/12/24 00:00'],"['1998/12/24 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/12/24 00:01 [medline]', '1998/12/24 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)57607-6 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1999 Jan 1;93(1):293-9.,"['CA 73773/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA16956/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'HG01165/HG/NHGRI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Ph-negative (Ph-) hematopoiesis can be restored in vivo after treatment with -interferon or intensive chemotherapy, suggesting that normal stem and progenitor cells coexist with the Ph+ clone. We have previously shown that Ph- progenitors are highly enriched in the CD34(+)HLA-DR- fraction from early chronic phase (ECP) CML patients. Previous studies have suggested that the Ph-translocation represents a secondary clonal hit occurring in an already clonally mutated Ph- progenitor or stem cells, leaving the unanswered question whether Ph- CD34(+)HLA-DR- progenitors are normal. To show the clonal nature of Ph- CD34(+)HLA-DR- CML progenitors, we have compared the expression of BCR/ABL mRNA with X-chromosome inactivation patterns (HUMARA) in mononuclear cells and in CD34(+)HLA-DR+ and CD34(+)HLA-DR- progenitors in marrow and blood obtained from 11 female CML patients (8 in chronic phase and 3 in accelerated phase [AP] disease). Steady-state marrow-derived BCR/ABL mRNA-, CD34(+)HLA-DR- progenitors had polyclonal X-chromosome inactivation patterns in 2 of 2 patients. The same polyclonal pattern was found in the progeny of CD34(+)HLA-DR- derived long-term culture-initiating cells. Mobilization with intensive chemotherapy induced a Ph-, BCR/ABL mRNA- and polyclonal state in the CD34(+)HLA-DR- and CD34(+)HLA-DR+ progenitors from 2 ECP patients. In a third ECP patient, polyclonal CD34(+) cells could only be found in the first peripheral blood collection. In contrast to ECP CML, steady-state marrow progenitors in late chronic phase and AP disease were mostly Ph+, BCR/ABL mRNA+, and clonal. Further, in the majority of these patients, a Ph-, polyclonal state could not be restored despite mobilization with intensive chemotherapy. We conclude from these studies that CD34(+)HLA-DR- cells that are Ph- and BCR/ABL mRNA- are polyclonal and therefore benign. This population is suitable for autografting in CML.","['Delforge, M', 'Boogaerts, M A', 'McGlave, P B', 'Verfaillie, C M']","['Delforge M', 'Boogaerts MA', 'McGlave PB', 'Verfaillie CM']","['Division of Hematology, the Department of Medicine, University Hospital Gasthuisberg, Leuven, Belgium.

The intracellular glutathione (GSH) content had a decisive effect on As2O3-induced apoptosis. Highly sensitive NB4 cells had the lowest GSH and the sensitivity of other cell lines was inversely proportional to their GSH content. The t(14;18) B-cell lymphoma cell line had low GSH levels and sensitivity to As2O3 at levels slightly higher than in APL cells. Experimental upmodulation of GSH content decreased the sensitivity to As2O3. Ascorbic acid and buthionine sulfoxide (BSO) decreased GSH to a greater extent, and rendered malignant cells more sensitive to As2O3. As2O3-induced apoptosis was not enhanced by ascorbic acid in normal cells, suggesting that the combination of ascorbic acid and As2O3 may be selectively toxic to some malignant cells. Ascorbic acid enhanced the antilymphoma effect of As2O3 in vivo without additional toxicity.

Two isoforms of Stat3 have been identified, (p92) and beta (p83), which have distinct transcriptional and biological functions. Activation of both Stat3 and Stat3beta requires the distal cytoplasmic domain of the G-CSFR, which contains four Tyr at positions 704, 729, 744, and 764. The studies reported here were undertaken to determine which, if any, of these tyrosine residues participated in Stat3/beta recruitment and activation. We showed that Stat3 and Stat3beta were affinity purified using phosphopeptides containing Y704 and Y744 but not by nonphosphorylated peptide analogues or by phosphopeptides containing Y729 and Y764. Complementary results were obtained in studies examining the ability of these peptides to destabilize and inhibit DNA binding of activated Stat3. Both Y704 and Y744 contributed to optimal activation of Stat3/beta in M1 murine myeloid leukemia cells containing wild-type and Y-to-F mutant G-CSFR constructs. Carboxy-terminal to Y704 at the +3 position is Gln; YXXQ represents a consensus Stat3 recruitment and activation motif. Y744 is followed at the +3 position by Cys (C); YXXC, represents a novel motif implicated in the recruitment and activation of Stat3. Modeling of the SH2 domain of Stat3 based on homologous SH2 domains of known structure revealed polar residues whose side chains contact the +3 position. This substitution may confer specificity for the Y704- and Y744-based ligands by allowing H-bond formation between the binding surface and the Gln or Cys found at the respective +3 position.","['Chakraborty, A', 'Dyer, K F', 'Cascio, M', 'Mietzner, T A', 'Tweardy, D J']","['Chakraborty A', 'Dyer KF', 'Cascio M', 'Mietzner TA', 'Tweardy DJ']","['Division of Infectious Diseases, the Department of Medicine, University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine and the University of Pittsburgh Cancer Institute, 200 Lothrop St, Pittsburgh,']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Peptide Fragments)', '0 (Phosphopeptides)', '0 (Receptors, Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT3 protein, human)', '0 (Stat3 protein, mouse)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '42HK56048U (Tyrosine)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Amino Acid Substitution/genetics', 'Animals', 'Binding, Competitive/genetics', 'Cell Line', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/isolation & purification/*metabolism', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/physiology', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutagenesis, Site-Directed', 'Peptide Fragments/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Phosphopeptides/isolation & purification/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Protein Binding/drug effects', 'Receptors, Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/biosynthesis/genetics/*metabolism', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor', 'Signal Transduction', 'Trans-Activators/antagonists & inhibitors/isolation & purification/*metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tyrosine/genetics/metabolism']",1998/12/24 00:00,1998/12/24 00:01,['1998/12/24 00:00'],"['1998/12/24 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/12/24 00:01 [medline]', '1998/12/24 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)57575-7 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1999 Jan 1;93(1):15-24.,['CA 72261/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

NU-B1 reacted with 7.7+/-3.9% of the healthy adult peripheral blood mononuclear cells but not with neutrophils, monocytes, red blood cells or thymocytes. In order to distinguish the reaction specificity of NU-B1, two-color immunofluorescence staining using tonsillar cells was performed, and it was demonstrated that NU-B1-positive cells coexpressed CD20, which is a representative B-cell antigen. The expression of NU-B1 was highly restricted to cells of B-cell lineage when a panel of hematopoietic cell lines was examined. In a pathoimmunohistological study using human lymph node tissue, NU-B1-positive cells were localized in the mantle and marginal zones. In a clinical study, NU-B1 reacted specifically with leukemias/lymphomas of B-cell lineage: all 43 cases of ALL including common ALL and biphenotypic leukemia, all 4 cases of B-cell ALL, 6/7 B-cell type malignant lymphomas and 2/4 B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemias. NU-B1 did not react with multiple myeloma, T-cell or myeloid leukemias/lymphomas. Immunoprecipitation of NU-B1 revealed two clear bands at 50 kDa and 42 kDa under either reducing or nonreducing conditions. Although anti-IgM treatment induced dramatic down modulation of CD79b, the NU-B1 antigen was also down modulated, but only slightly. However, crosslinking of NU-B1 did not induce tyrosine phosphorylation of intracellular proteins or the mobilization of calcium in NALM-16. The present results revealed that the antigenic determinant recognized by NU-B1 is not surface immunoglobulin chains, HLA-DR, a receptor for C3, Fc for immunoglobulin chains or any known CD molecule. We conclude that monoclonal antibody NU-B1 recognizes a novel human B-cell restricted antigen distinct from known CD molecules, and that it is a useful antibody in the immunophenotyping and classification of leukemias/lymphomas.","['Matsuo, Y', 'Sugimoto, A', 'Kuwahara, K', 'Watanabe, Y', 'Sakata, A', 'Sakaguchi, N', 'Sagawa, K', 'Orita, K']","['Matsuo Y', 'Sugimoto A', 'Kuwahara K', 'Watanabe Y', 'Sakata A', 'Sakaguchi N', 'Sagawa K', 'Orita K']","['Fujisaki Cell Center, Hayashibara Biochemical Labs., Inc., Okayama, Japan. yomatsuo@hayashibara.co.jp']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Tissue Antigens,Tissue antigens,0331072,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, CD)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/*immunology', 'Antigens, CD/*immunology', 'B-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Flow Cytometry/methods', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique, Indirect', 'Humans', 'Precipitin Tests', 'Staining and Labeling', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1998/12/24 00:00,1998/12/24 00:01,['1998/12/24 00:00'],"['1998/12/24 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/12/24 00:01 [medline]', '1998/12/24 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1399-0039.1998.tb03068.x [doi]'],ppublish,Tissue Antigens. 1998 Nov;52(5):422-9. doi: 10.1111/j.1399-0039.1998.tb03068.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Preliminary results of the viral loads and CD4 numbers.,417-26,"This paper presents the evolution during its follow-up of a virostatic combination study of the type I-II trial conducted on ten AIDS-related complex (ARC) or acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) patients [1, 9, respectively]. Its concept is based on the following original notions: a) it is not the number of the virostatics applied to each patient at any phase which determines their effect; it is the number of affected virus targets which determines the effect. Thus, the so called ""tritherapies"", imposed by the ""AIDS Command"" to thousands of patients selected at random, to be compared to the same number of subjects receiving only ""bi"" or ""monotherapies"", might be beginning to face failure because they attack only two targets: retro-transcriptase and HIV1 protease. Having discovered, owing to our experimental screening, original HIV1 virostatics, acriflavine (ACF) and several ellipticine analogues among which we have used methyl-hydroxy-ellipticine (MHE), we are able to attack two virus targets unaffected by classical virostatics: ACF attacks DNA, from its integrated double branched stage to the provirus one, and MHE inhibits topoisomerase II. We experimentally combined these two agents with AZT, which inhibits retro-transcriptase, thus we realized a combination affecting three targets. This three agent combination was able to eradicate Friend's virus from infected mice. Clinically, combinations of three drugs affecting four targets (as they are selected among the ten virostatics available today) give a stronger result than three drug combinations affecting only three targets, because they were selected from the five virostatics which were the only ones available at the beginning of the present study. Five patients out of five who received the combinations of four virostatics chosen among the ten currently available (thus affecting four targets) from the beginning of their treatment to the present have all reduced their viral load (VL) and maintained it below the detectable level (< 200 RNA copies/mL then 20 copies/mL); b) as the toxicities of virostatics and as HIV1 resistances may happen as soon as 12 weeks of treatment, the combinations have been, in our study, applied in shorter (3 week) sequences, differing from each other due to drug rotation; c) neither toxicity nor resistance occurred; d) curiously, the CD4 numbers, even when they increased rapidly, has never attained their normal count, and their curve may be a Gombertzian one. This CD4 restoration limitation can be due to persisting virus, as indicated in some patients by small peaks which may appear on some VL plateaus, though they disappear without treatment change.","['Mathe, G', 'Morette, C', 'Hallard, M', 'Blanquet, D']","['Mathe G', 'Morette C', 'Hallard M', 'Blanquet D']","[""Institut de Cancerologie et d'Immunologie & Hopital Suisse de Paris, Issy-les-Moulineaux, France.""]",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Clinical Trial, Phase I', 'Clinical Trial, Phase II', 'Comment', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",France,Biomed Pharmacother,Biomedicine & pharmacotherapy = Biomedecine & pharmacotherapie,8213295,"['0 (Anti-HIV Agents)', '0 (Ellipticines)', '69467-90-9 (N(2),N(6)-dimethyl-9-hydroxyellipticinium)']",IM,"['AIDS-Related Complex/*drug therapy/immunology', 'Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome/*drug therapy/immunology', 'Animals', 'Anti-HIV Agents/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', '*CD4 Lymphocyte Count', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Drug Resistance, Microbial', 'Drug Therapy, Combination', 'Ellipticines/therapeutic use', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Friend murine leukemia virus/drug effects', 'HIV-1/drug effects/*isolation & purification/physiology', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Retroviridae Infections/drug therapy', 'Tumor Virus Infections/drug therapy']",1997/01/01 00:00,1998/12/24 00:01,['1997/01/01 00:00'],"['1997/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/12/24 00:01 [medline]', '1997/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0753332297823190 [pii]', '10.1016/s0753-3322(97)82319-0 [doi]']",ppublish,Biomed Pharmacother. 1997;51(10):417-26. doi: 10.1016/s0753-3322(97)82319-0.,,,,,,,,['Biomed Pharmacother. 1997;51(10):413-6.

Although these subgroups include different pathohistological types of NHL, they are considered sufficiently homogenous for joint therapy planning [1]. The first generation protocol (CHOP) managed to achieve complete remission (CR) in 50-55% of patients with 30-35% of survival rate [2]. A large four-branch comparative study of SWOG group compared CHOP as the first generation protocol with the third generation protocols ProMACE CytaBOM, m-BACOD and MCOD-D. The results have shown a similar CR and survival rates, so that CHOP is considered a gold standard for the treatment of aggressive NHL [6]. In the light of individual reports stating a high CR rate in the treatment of aggressive NHL by ProMACE CytaBOM [3-5] we present our experience and observations related to the use of this protocol. METHOD: Over the period from 1991 through May 1996 at the Department of Lymphoproliferative Diseases, Institute of Haematology, Clinical Centre of Serbia in Belgrade, we treated 25 patients with pathohistologic evidence of medium to high risk lymphomas, where cases of lymphoblast lymphoma and Burkit's lymphoma were excluded. The median follow-up was 27 months (maximum 63 months). RESULTS: Four of 25 patients were > 60 years. Three of these died. Pathohistological analysis revealed that of 20 cases of medium risk aggressive lymphoma five had diffuse, small cleaved cells, 7 had diffuse mixed and 8 diffuse centroblast cells. Although diffuse NHL with small cleaved cells is classified into clinically indolent lymphomas, two of five patients were in the fourth clinical stage, and three of five patients had a large tumorous mass. In the high risk group five patients had immunoblast lymphoma. Karnofsky index was high in 20/25. According to Ann Arbor criteria 19/25 patients were in IVCS and 7/25 had a large tumour mass. Most patients had clinical symptoms (21/25). Extranodal localization was confirmed in 19 patients. Bone marrow and hepatic infiltrations were most common: 9 and 6 patients, respectively. Eleven patients had a single extranodal localization, while 8 had 2 or more. The median follow-up was 27 months (maximum 63 months), and 21/25 (84%) patients responded to therapy (CR + PR). Complete remission was achieved in 14 patients (56%), and PR in 7 (28%) patients. In the CR group two died, and relapse developed in one after 28 months. In 11 cases CR is maintained. The average duration of CR was 16 months (3-38 months), and PR was maintained for 6 months (20 months in one case). The average survival was 24.5 months (range 3-53). DISCUSSION: The fact that a half of adult patients with disseminated aggressive NHL can be cured with combined chemotherapy is the major oncological achievement in the last 20 years. The protocol combines 4-8 drugs, and the joint report of the SFOG group for lymphoma in over 1200 patients with lymphoma has shown that the second and third generation protocols are not more effective than the standard CHOP or CHOPBleom protocols [6]. The optimum therapeutic protocol in the treatment of aggressive lymphoma is still unpredictable due to the fact that it is inadequate to compare the results of individual institutions with the results of collaborative groups; there is also a significant difference in the prognostic factors in different research groups; there is no sufficient complete and published results that suggest the lower CR than the original reports (which may be related to the evaluation of tumour and remission). There are not sufficient data on the incidence of secondary carcinoma and leukaemia [1].

OCC activated the protein kinase A(PKA) in the cytosol of HL-60 cells and inhibited its binding to cAMP. The activities of PKA in the cytosol of HL-60 cells treated with OCC were more significantly increased than those in control cells.

With this treatment major cytogenetic responses can be achieved in 30% to 50% of patients. Regular monitoring of cytogenetic response is essential for the therapeutic management of these patients. As conventional cytogenetics is not always successful, especially under IFN-alpha treatment, molecular cytogenetic methods have been established for the examination of interphase nuclei for the presence of the BCR-ABL fusion gene, the molecular counterpart of the Philadelphia chromosome. To demonstrate the value of these new methods we have analysed interphase nuclei from sequentially cultured bone marrow cells from 14 CML patients who were treated with IFN-alpha and whose bone marrow was investigated regularly during therapy. Dual-colour FISH with a breakpoint spanning BCR-YAC and a flanking cosmid from the ABL region was applied. When compared with conventional cytogenetics the results achieved by FISH were favourable. The most evident advantage of FISH analysis is that in case of failure of conventional cytogenetics a reliable determination of the remission status can be done. Together with other recent studies our results illustrate the advantages and limitations of the interphase FISH method for monitoring CML patients.","['Duba, H C', 'Peter, S', 'Hilbe, W', 'Fluckinger, T', 'Fridrik, M', 'Erdel, M', 'Thaler, J', 'Utermann, G']","['Duba HC', 'Peter S', 'Hilbe W', 'Fluckinger T', 'Fridrik M', 'Erdel M', 'Thaler J', 'Utermann G']","['Institut fur Medizinische Biologie und Humangenetik der Universitat Innsbruck, A-6020 Innsbruck, Austria.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Greece,Int J Oncol,International journal of oncology,9306042,['0 (Interferon-alpha)'],IM,"['Adult', 'Female', 'Humans', '*In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Interferon-alpha/*therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/genetics/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Philadelphia Chromosome']",1998/12/24 00:00,1998/12/24 00:01,['1998/12/24 00:00'],"['1998/12/24 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/12/24 00:01 [medline]', '1998/12/24 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.3892/ijo.14.1.145 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Oncol. 1999 Jan;14(1):145-50. doi: 10.3892/ijo.14.1.145.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have isolated a variant HL60 clone that exhibited a conditional PMA-induced oxidative response depending on the agent used for the differentiation. While cells differentiated with DMSO responded to either PMA or N-formyl peptide (N-formyl-Met-Leu-Phe-Lys or fMLFK), cells differentiated with dibutyryl-cAMP (Bt2cAMP) responded to fMLFK but very poorly to PMA. However, in Bt2cAMP-differentiated cells, the expression of the different PKC isoforms was similar to that observed in DMSO-differentiated cells. Moreover, PMA was able to induce a normal phosphorylation of the cytosolic factor p47phox and to fully activate extracellular signal-regulated kinases (Erk1/2). Interestingly, Bt2cAMP-differentiated cells exhibited a strong and sustained O2- production when costimulated with PMA and suboptimal concentrations of fMLFK which were, per se, ineffective. This sustained response was only slightly reduced by the conjunction of the mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase kinase (MEK) inhibitor PD98059 and wortmannin, a phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase (PI3K) inhibitor. Variant HL60 cells that were stably transfected with a constitutively active form of Rac1 were able, when differentiated with Bt2cAMP, to secrete oxidant following PMA stimulation. Altogether, the results suggest that, in addition to the phosphorylation of p47phox, the activation of NADPH oxidase requires the activation of a Rac protein through a pathway that diverges at a point upstream of MEK and that is independent of the activation of wortmannin sensitive PI3K.","['Tardif, M', 'Rabiet, M J', 'Christophe, T', 'Milcent, M D', 'Boulay, F']","['Tardif M', 'Rabiet MJ', 'Christophe T', 'Milcent MD', 'Boulay F']","[""Commissariat a l'Energie Atomique (CEA)/Grenoble, Laboratoire de Biochimie et de Biophysique des Systemes Integres (UMR 314 CEA/Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique), Grenoble, France.""]",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Androstadienes)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Flavonoids)', '0 (Isoenzymes)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Phosphoinositide-3 Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Phosphoproteins)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Virulence Factors, Bordetella)', '59880-97-6 (N-Formylmethionine Leucyl-Phenylalanine)', '63X7MBT2LQ (Bucladesine)', '81213-55-0 (N-formylmethionyl-leucyl-phenylalanyl-lysine)', 'EC 1.6.3.- (NADPH Oxidases)', 'EC 1.6.3.1 (neutrophil cytosolic factor 1)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'EC 2.7.11.17 (Calcium-Calmodulin-Dependent Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 3)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.25 (MAP Kinase Kinase Kinase 1)', 'EC 2.7.11.25 (MAP3K1 protein, human)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (GTP-Binding Proteins)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (rac GTP-Binding Proteins)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)', 'SJE1IO5E3I (2-(2-amino-3-methoxyphenyl)-4H-1-benzopyran-4-one)', 'XVA4O219QW (Wortmannin)', 'YOW8V9698H (Dimethyl Sulfoxide)']",IM,"['Androstadienes/pharmacology', 'Bucladesine/pharmacology', 'Calcium-Calmodulin-Dependent Protein Kinases/metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Dimethyl Sulfoxide/pharmacology', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Flavonoids/pharmacology', 'GTP-Binding Proteins/genetics/*physiology', 'HL-60 Cells/drug effects/*enzymology', 'Humans', 'Isoenzymes/metabolism', '*MAP Kinase Kinase Kinase 1', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 3', '*Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases', 'Models, Biological', 'N-Formylmethionine Leucyl-Phenylalanine/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'NADPH Oxidases/*metabolism', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*metabolism', 'Oxidation-Reduction', 'Oxidative Stress', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/physiology', 'Phosphoinositide-3 Kinase Inhibitors', 'Phosphoproteins/metabolism', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Protein Kinase C/metabolism', 'Protein Processing, Post-Translational/drug effects', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors/physiology', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/physiology', 'Signal Transduction/*drug effects/physiology', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/*pharmacology', 'Transfection', 'Virulence Factors, Bordetella/pharmacology', 'Wortmannin', 'rac GTP-Binding Proteins']",1998/12/23 00:00,1998/12/23 00:01,['1998/12/23 00:00'],"['1998/12/23 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/12/23 00:01 [medline]', '1998/12/23 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Immunol. 1998 Dec 15;161(12):6885-95.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The promoter segment between -130 and +46, relative to the first initiation site for mouse GL alpha transcripts, is sufficient for expression and TGF-beta1 inducibility of a reporter gene in B cell lines. Within this segment resides a TGF-beta1-responsive element (TbetaRE) that is required for induction of the promoter by TGF-beta1 and, when multimerized, is sufficient to transfer TGF-beta1 inducibility to another promoter. In this report we show that a TGF-beta1-inducible complex binds the TbetaRE and contains the transcription factor core-binding factor (CBF; also known as acute myeloid leukemia, AML). Although all three CBF alpha family members activate the GL alpha promoter, only CBF alpha3 (AML-2) is induced by TGF-beta1 in splenic B and I.29mu cells. The TbetaRE contains two CBF binding sites. Mutation of both sites reduces but does not eliminate induction of the GL alpha promoter by TGF-beta1 or by overexpression of CBF, possibly due to the presence of an additional CBF site in the promoter. In addition, the TbetaRE contains two copies of another sequence motif. Mutation of these motifs eliminates TGF-beta1 induction of the GL alpha promoter. Together the data indicate that TGF-beta1 induction of the alpha promoter involves induction of CBF alpha3, which binds to the TbetaRE of the promoter along with one or more proteins.","['Shi, M J', 'Stavnezer, J']","['Shi MJ', 'Stavnezer J']","['Department of Molecular Genetics and Microbiology, University of Massachusetts Medical School, Worcester 01655, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Core Binding Factors)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Immunoglobulin A)', '0 (Immunoglobulin M)', '0 (Macromolecular Substances)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Transforming Growth Factor beta)']",IM,"['Animals', 'B-Lymphocytes/*drug effects/immunology', 'Core Binding Factors', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*physiology', 'Gene Expression Regulation/*drug effects', '*Genes, Immunoglobulin', 'Genes, Reporter', 'Immunoglobulin A/*genetics', 'Immunoglobulin Class Switching/*drug effects', 'Immunoglobulin M/biosynthesis/immunology', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/pathology', 'Macromolecular Substances', 'Mice', '*Neoplasm Proteins', '*Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell/biosynthesis/immunology', 'Spleen/cytology', 'Transcription Factors/*physiology', 'Transforming Growth Factor beta/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1998/12/23 00:00,1998/12/23 00:01,['1998/12/23 00:00'],"['1998/12/23 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/12/23 00:01 [medline]', '1998/12/23 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Immunol. 1998 Dec 15;161(12):6751-60.,['R01AI23283/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Previous evidence that the pan-prenylation inhibitor lovastatin blocks Ag-stimulated Ca2+ influx, secretion, and membrane/cytoskeletal responses implicated isoprenylated proteins in the Fc epsilonRI-coupled signaling cascade but could not distinguish between contributions of C15 (farnesylated) and C20 (geranylgeranylated) species. Here we establish concentrations of lovastatin and the farnesyl-specific inhibitor BZA-5B that inhibit the farnesylation and Ag-induced activation of Ras species in RBL-2H3 cells (H-Ras, K-RasA, and K-RasB). These inhibitors have little effect on tyrosine kinase activation, which initiates Fc epsilonRI signaling. Although Ras is disabled, only lovastatin substantially blocks Raf-1 activation, and neither inhibitor affects mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase/extracellular signal regulated kinase kinase (MEK) or ERK1/ERK2 activation. Thus, the pathway to Fc epsilonRI-mediated MEK/ERK and ERK activation can apparently bypass Ras and Raf-1. Predictably, only lovastatin inhibits Ag-induced ruffling, spreading, and secretion, previously linked to geranylgeranylated Rho and Rab family members. Additionally, only lovastatin inhibits phospholipase Cgamma-mediated inositol (1,4,5) trisphosphate production, sustained Ca2+ influx, and Ca2+-dependent IL-4 production, suggesting novel roles for geranylgeranylated (lovastatin-sensitive, BZA-5B-insensitive) proteins in Fc epsilonRI signal propagation. Remarkably, BZA-5B concentrations too low to inactivate Ras reduce the lag time to Ag-induced Ca2+ stores release and enhance secretion. These results link a non-Ras farnesylated protein(s) to the negative regulation of Ca2+ release from intracellular stores and secretion. We identified no clear role for Ras in Fc epsilonRI-coupled signaling but suggest its involvement in mast cell growth regulation based on the inhibition of cell proliferation by both BZA-5B and lovastatin.","['Graham, T E', 'Pfeiffer, J R', 'Lee, R J', 'Kusewitt, D F', 'Martinez, A M', 'Foutz, T', 'Wilson, B S', 'Oliver, J M']","['Graham TE', 'Pfeiffer JR', 'Lee RJ', 'Kusewitt DF', 'Martinez AM', 'Foutz T', 'Wilson BS', 'Oliver JM']","['Department of Pathology, University of New Mexico Health Sciences Center, Albuquerque 87131, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (BZA 5B)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Isoenzymes)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Oligopeptides)', '0 (Protein Isoforms)', '0 (Receptors, IgE)', '12794-10-4 (Benzodiazepines)', '37341-29-0 (Immunoglobulin E)', '85166-31-0 (Inositol 1,4,5-Trisphosphate)', '9LHU78OQFD (Lovastatin)', 'EC 2.5.- (Alkyl and Aryl Transferases)', 'EC 2.5.1.29 (Farnesyltranstransferase)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-raf)', 'EC 2.7.11.17 (Calcium-Calmodulin-Dependent Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 3)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 3.1.4.- (Type C Phospholipases)', 'EC 3.1.4.3 (Phospholipase C gamma)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (ras Proteins)']",IM,"['Alkyl and Aryl Transferases/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Animals', 'Benzodiazepines/pharmacology', 'Calcium Signaling/physiology', 'Calcium-Calmodulin-Dependent Protein Kinases/*metabolism', 'Cell Division', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Farnesyltranstransferase', 'Immunoglobulin E/immunology', 'Inositol 1,4,5-Trisphosphate/metabolism', 'Isoenzymes/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Leukemia, Basophilic, Acute/pathology', 'Lovastatin/pharmacology', 'Mast Cells/drug effects/*enzymology/immunology', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 3', '*Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases', 'Neoplasm Proteins/metabolism', 'Oligopeptides/pharmacology', 'Phospholipase C gamma', 'Protein Isoforms/deficiency/*metabolism', 'Protein Prenylation/drug effects', 'Protein Processing, Post-Translational/drug effects', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-raf/metabolism', 'Rats', 'Receptors, IgE/*immunology', 'Signal Transduction/*physiology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects', 'Type C Phospholipases/antagonists & inhibitors', 'ras Proteins/deficiency/*metabolism']",1998/12/23 00:00,1998/12/23 00:01,['1998/12/23 00:00'],"['1998/12/23 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/12/23 00:01 [medline]', '1998/12/23 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Immunol. 1998 Dec 15;161(12):6733-44.,"['GM49814/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'GM50562/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'HL56384/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In two of four asymptomatic HTLV-I carriers and in four of five patients with HTLV-I-associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis (HAM/TSP), mono- or oligoclonal expansions were detected in the CD4+ T cell subset. In one patient with adult T cell leukemia, a specific clone bearing Vbeta7 was detected in the CD4+ T cell subset. In contrast, clonal expansion was not observed in the CD4 T cell subsets of three individuals with asymptomatic HTLV-II infection or in our previous studies of a large number of uninfected individuals. Oligoclonal expansions in the CD8+ T cell subset were detected in all subjects, including the patient with adult T cell leukemia. No differences in the number of expanded clones were noted between asymptomatic carriers and in patients with HAM/TSP and there was no obvious restriction in the TCR V region usage. Direct sequencing revealed no significant bias in the CDR3 motifs utilized by the predominant clones. This report is the first direct demonstration of clonal expansions within fractionated T cell subsets (CD4+ and CD8+) in HTLV-I infections and suggests that 1) clonal expansion of CD4+ T lymphocytes likely occurs as a direct result of infection and 2) polyclonal CD8+ T cell expansion occurs frequently and independently of disease association.","['Eiraku, N', 'Hingorani, R', 'Ijichi, S', 'Machigashira, K', 'Gregersen, P K', 'Monteiro, J', 'Usuku, K', 'Yashiki, S', 'Sonoda, S', 'Osame, M', 'Hall, W W']","['Eiraku N', 'Hingorani R', 'Ijichi S', 'Machigashira K', 'Gregersen PK', 'Monteiro J', 'Usuku K', 'Yashiki S', 'Sonoda S', 'Osame M', 'Hall WW']","['Laboratory of Medical Virology, The Rockefeller University, New York, NY 10021, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (HLA Antigens)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, alpha-beta)']",IM,"['Adult', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/*pathology', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/*pathology', 'Carrier State/*immunology/pathology', 'Clone Cells/*pathology', 'Female', 'Gene Rearrangement, T-Lymphocyte', 'Gene Rearrangement, beta-Chain T-Cell Antigen Receptor', 'HLA Antigens/analysis', 'HTLV-I Infections/*immunology/pathology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/immunology/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Proteins/analysis', 'Paraparesis, Tropical Spastic/immunology/pathology', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, alpha-beta/genetics', 'T-Lymphocyte Subsets/*pathology']",1998/12/23 00:00,1998/12/23 00:01,['1998/12/23 00:00'],"['1998/12/23 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/12/23 00:01 [medline]', '1998/12/23 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Immunol. 1998 Dec 15;161(12):6674-80.,"['AI33454/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 64038/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although autoimmune pathogenesis was suggested, the detailed mechanisms remain to be elucidated. In this report, we examined effects of the MHC and fas genes on the development of the disease. When pX-Tg mice were backcrossed with different inbred strains, the incidence of arthritis differed among strains; 64% and 72% in BALB/cAn (H-2d), 25% and 46% in C3H/HeN (H-2k), and 0% and 2% in C57BL/6J (H-2b) background at 3 and 6 months of age, respectively. Rheumatoid factor levels in the serum correlated with the susceptibility to the disease, whereas IL-1beta and MHC gene expression were similarly elevated in all of these strains, suggesting involvement of immune regulatory genes in this strain difference. However, introduction of the H-2d locus into C57BL/6J pX-Tg mice did not increase the incidence of arthritis, and substitution of the BALB/cAn H-2 locus with the H-2b did not decrease it. The results indicate that the H-2 locus is not the major determinant of the disease. Then, since previous study indicated a defect in Fas-mediated apoptosis of transgenic T cells, the effects of fas gene modification on the disease were examined. The incidence increased when these pX-Tg mice were crossed with lpr/lpr mice, while it decreased when crossed with fas-transgenic mice. These observations suggest that aberration of Fas-mediated apoptosis of peripheral lymphocytes, rather than negative selection in the thymus, is involved in the development of autoimmune arthropathy in pX-Tg mice.","['Iwakura, Y', 'Itagaki, K', 'Ishitsuka, C', 'Yamasaki, Y', 'Matsuzawa, A', 'Yonehara, S', 'Karasawa, S', 'Ueda, S', 'Saijo, S']","['Iwakura Y', 'Itagaki K', 'Ishitsuka C', 'Yamasaki Y', 'Matsuzawa A', 'Yonehara S', 'Karasawa S', 'Ueda S', 'Saijo S']","['Laboratory Animal Research Center, Institute of Medical Science, University of Tokyo, Japan. iwakura@ims.u-tokyo.ac.jp']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (H-2 Antigens)', '0 (fas Receptor)', '9009-79-4 (Rheumatoid Factor)']",IM,"['Animals', '*Apoptosis', 'Arthritis, Rheumatoid/etiology/*immunology', 'Autoimmune Diseases/etiology/*immunology', 'Clonal Deletion', 'Crosses, Genetic', 'Disease Susceptibility', '*Genes, env', '*Genes, pX', 'H-2 Antigens/genetics/*immunology', 'Haplotypes/genetics', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*genetics', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Inbred C3H', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Mutant Strains', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Rheumatoid Factor/analysis', 'Species Specificity', 'fas Receptor/genetics/*immunology']",1998/12/23 00:00,1998/12/23 00:01,['1998/12/23 00:00'],"['1998/12/23 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/12/23 00:01 [medline]', '1998/12/23 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Immunol. 1998 Dec 15;161(12):6592-8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Some of them are encoded by MAGE-type genes, which are silent in normal tissues except in male germ cells, but are activated in a variety of tumors. These tumor-specific shared antigens appear to be promising targets for cancer immunotherapy. However, the choice of these antigens as targets has been questioned because of the lack of direct evidence that in vivo responses against such antigens can lead to tumor rejection. The antigen encoded by the mouse gene P1A represents the only available animal model system for MAGE-type tumor antigens. We show here that mice immunized by injection of L1210 leukemia cells expressing P1A and B7-1 (L1210.P1A.B7-1) are efficiently protected against a challenge with a lethal dose of mastocytoma P815 tumor cells, which express P1A. Mice immunized with L1210 cells expressing B7-1 but not P1A were not protected. Furthermore, we observed that P1A-transgenic mice, which are tolerant to P1A, were not protected after immunization with L1210.P1A.B7-1. These results demonstrate that the immune response to P1A is the major component of the tumor rejection response observed in normal mice, and support the use of tumor-specific shared antigens as targets for the immunotherapy of human cancer.","['Brandle, D', 'Bilsborough, J', 'Rulicke, T', 'Uyttenhove, C', 'Boon, T', 'Van den Eynde, B J']","['Brandle D', 'Bilsborough J', 'Rulicke T', 'Uyttenhove C', 'Boon T', 'Van den Eynde BJ']","['Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research, Brussels, Belgium.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Eur J Immunol,European journal of immunology,1273201,"['0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (B7-1 Antigen)', '0 (tumor rejection antigen P815A, mouse)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/genetics/*immunology', 'B7-1 Antigen/immunology', '*Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*immunology/pathology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/*immunology']",1998/12/23 03:03,2000/06/20 09:00,['1998/12/23 03:03'],"['1998/12/23 03:03 [pubmed]', '2000/06/20 09:00 [medline]', '1998/12/23 03:03 [entrez]']",['10.1002/(SICI)1521-4141(199812)28:12<4010::AID-IMMU4010>3.0.CO;2-5 [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Immunol. 1998 Dec;28(12):4010-9. doi: 10.1002/(SICI)1521-4141(199812)28:12<4010::AID-IMMU4010>3.0.CO;2-5.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

DESIGN: Prospective multi-institutional study of naturally occurring feline lymphosarcoma. METHODS: Veterinarians in Sydney were provided with free diagnostic laboratory services for suspect cases of feline lymphosarcoma. Lymphosarcoma was diagnosed based on physical findings, radiographic and/or ultrasonographic images and results of cytological or histopathological examination. When owners were not interested in pursuing an antemortem diagnosis, suspect cases were collected for necropsy. Patients' characteristics and physical findings were recorded. A modified scheme for anatomical classification of lesions was devised including a 'mixed' category for cases which involved two or more anatomical forms. RESULTS: One hundred and eighteen cases were accrued over an 18 month period. The median age was 120 months and range 5 to 212 months. Age distribution was bimodal, with a small peak for cats less than 24 months, and a normal distribution centred on 97 to 120 months. Eighty cats were domestic crossbreds, 22 were Siamese or Oriental cats (including crosses), 6 were Burmese, 5 were purebred longhairs and the remaining 5 were one of a number of purebred shorthaired breeds. In comparison to 1017 consecutive cases admitted to our hospital for conditions other than lymphosarcoma, Siamese/Oriental cats were over-represented amongst lymphosarcoma cases (P = 0.0006). Male cats were also over-represented, accounting for 72 of 118 cases (P = 0.05). Abdominal lymphosarcoma was the most common anatomical form (43 cats), followed by mixed (39), nodal (20), mediastinal (9) and atypical (involving non-lymphoid organs, 7) forms. When analysed for specific organ involvement, 29 (25%) had mediastinal involvement, 71 (60%) had abdominal involvement including 60 (51%) with involvement of the intestinal tract and/or mesenteric lymph nodes and 36 (31%) with bilateral renal involvement, and 47 (40%) had peripheral lymph node involvement. No case of primary lymphoid leukaemia was identified. A noticeable subgroup of cats younger than 24 months had involvement of the anterior mediastinum with or without concurrent enlargement of cervical or axillary lymph nodes; Siamese/Oriental cats were over-represented in this subgroup. Among cases with nodal involvement, lymph nodes of the head and neck were frequently involved, mandibular nodes most commonly, followed by superficial cervical nodes. In seven cases a solitary node was affected. CONCLUSIONS: Compared with similar surveys overseas, our cats were older and male cats were over-represented. There was a notable subgroup of young cats with mediastinal involvement. Siamese/Oriental cats were over-represented in this subgroup as well as in the larger population of cats with lymphosarcoma. Compared with overseas surveys, renal involvement, mixed cases and atypical cases (including nasal lymphosarcoma) were more common. A new subcategory of nodal lymphosarcoma, with involvement restricted to node(s) of head and neck, was identified.","['Gabor, L J', 'Malik, R', 'Canfield, P J']","['Gabor LJ', 'Malik R', 'Canfield PJ']","['Department of Veterinary Anatomy and Pathology, Faculty of Veterinary Science, University of Sydney, New South Wales.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Aust Vet J,Australian veterinary journal,0370616,,IM,"['Age Distribution', 'Animals', 'Breeding', '*Cat Diseases/epidemiology/pathology', 'Cats', 'Female', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/epidemiology/pathology/*veterinary', 'Male', 'New South Wales/epidemiology', 'Prospective Studies', 'Sex Distribution']",1998/12/23 00:00,1998/12/23 00:01,['1998/12/23 00:00'],"['1998/12/23 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/12/23 00:01 [medline]', '1998/12/23 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1751-0813.1998.tb12300.x [doi]'],ppublish,Aust Vet J. 1998 Nov;76(11):725-32. doi: 10.1111/j.1751-0813.1998.tb12300.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As survival rates following treatment for haematological malignancies improve, chemotherapy-induced ovarian failure is becoming more common. However, there are few data concerning the impact of this on bone mineral density (BMD). We have therefore measured the BMD in 33 women with ovarian failure following treatment with cytotoxic chemotherapy. PATIENTS AND DESIGN: We studied 33 women who received combination chemotherapy for Hodgkin's disease (n = 27), non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (n = 4), sarcoma (n = 1) and acute myeloid leukaemia (n = 1). The mean (range) age of the subjects at the time of BMD measurement was 37.5 (24-50) years and the mean (median: range) duration of amenorrhoea was 49 (24: 5-277) months. Eleven women had received hormone replacement therapy (HRT) for a mean (range) duration of 25 (1-62) months. BMD was measured by single photon absorptiometry or single X-ray absorptiometry, and dual energy X-ray absorptiometry at the distal and proximal radius, the femoral neck and the lumbar spine, respectively. BMD was expressed as Z-scores and statistical analysis was performed using the Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed-rank test. RESULTS: There was no significant reduction in BMD at the hip, spine or a forearm in the cohort as a whole, although there was a trend to reduce bone density at all sites. When patients who had received HRT were excluded from the analysis there were small reductions in mean BMD at all sites, but this was only statistically significant at the proximal forearm (Z-score = -0.65; P = 0.03). Mean BMD of the HRT-treated patients was normal at all sites. Only seven patients (21%) had a BMD Z-score < -2 at any site. CONCLUSION: It is inappropriate to assume that ovarian failure from different aetiologies has a similar deleterious impact on the skeleton. Untreated premature ovarian failure following cytotoxic chemotherapy results in some reduction in bone mineral density, but this is of a minor degree and is less than that observed in other hypo-oestrogenic states. The reason for this is unclear but studies of residual hormone production in the cytotoxic-damaged ovary may provide an answer.","['Howell, S J', 'Berger, G', 'Adams, J E', 'Shalet, S M']","['Howell SJ', 'Berger G', 'Adams JE', 'Shalet SM']","['Department of Endocrinology, Christie Hospital NHS Trust, Manchester.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Clin Endocrinol (Oxf),Clinical endocrinology,0346653,,IM,"['Adult', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', '*Bone Density', 'Female', 'Hodgkin Disease/drug therapy/physiopathology', 'Hormone Replacement Therapy', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/physiopathology', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/drug therapy/physiopathology', 'Middle Aged', 'Primary Ovarian Insufficiency/*chemically induced/drug therapy/physiopathology', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Sarcoma/drug therapy/physiopathology', 'Statistics, Nonparametric']",1998/12/23 00:00,1998/12/23 00:01,['1998/12/23 00:00'],"['1998/12/23 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/12/23 00:01 [medline]', '1998/12/23 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1046/j.1365-2265.1998.00550.x [doi]'],ppublish,Clin Endocrinol (Oxf). 1998 Sep;49(3):397-402. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2265.1998.00550.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We identified a gene coding for a protein kinase, protein kinase X (PRKX), which was expressed in the maturation-susceptible, but not in the resistant, cell line. The expression of the PRKX gene was found to be induced during monocyte, macrophage, and granulocyte maturation of HL-60 cells. We also studied the expression of the PRKX gene in 12 different human tissues and transformed cell lines and found that, among these tissues and cell types, the PRKX gene is expressed only in blood. Among the blood cell lineages, the PRKX gene is specifically expressed in macrophages and granulocytes. Antisense inhibition of PRKX expression blocked terminal development in both the leukemic HL-60 cells and normal peripheral blood monocytes, implying that PRKX is a key mediator of macrophage and granulocyte maturation. Using the HL-60 cell variant deficient in protein kinase C-beta (PKC-beta) and several stable PKC-beta transfectants, we found that PRKX gene expression is under control of PKC-beta; hence PRKX is likely to act downstream of this PKC isozyme in the same signal transduction pathway leading to macrophage maturation.","['Semizarov, D', 'Glesne, D', 'Laouar, A', 'Schiebel, K', 'Huberman, E']","['Semizarov D', 'Glesne D', 'Laouar A', 'Schiebel K', 'Huberman E']","['Center for Mechanistic Biology and Biotechnology, Argonne National Laboratory, 9700 South Cass Avenue, Argonne, IL 60439, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (DEAF1 protein, human)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Oligodeoxyribonucleotides)', '0 (Oligodeoxyribonucleotides, Antisense)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '81627-83-0 (Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (PRKX protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'FXC9231JVH (Calcitriol)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Calcitriol/pharmacology', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects/*physiology', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Genetic Variation', 'Granulocytes/cytology/enzymology', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Lymphocytes/cytology/enzymology', 'Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/pharmacology', 'Macrophages/*cytology/enzymology', 'Monocytes/cytology/enzymology', 'Nuclear Proteins', 'Oligodeoxyribonucleotides/pharmacology', 'Oligodeoxyribonucleotides, Antisense/*pharmacology', 'Organ Specificity', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/*genetics/metabolism', 'Recombinant Proteins/metabolism', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Transcription Factors', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Transfection']",1998/12/23 00:00,1998/12/23 00:01,['1998/12/23 00:00'],"['1998/12/23 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/12/23 00:01 [medline]', '1998/12/23 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1073/pnas.95.26.15412 [doi]'],ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1998 Dec 22;95(26):15412-7. doi: 10.1073/pnas.95.26.15412.,,,PMC28056,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

HTLV-I protease cleavage of a peptide representing the HTLV-I retroviral processing site P19/24 (APQVLPVMHPHG) yielded Km and kcat values of 470 microM and 0.184 s-1 while cleavage of a peptide representing the processing site P24/15 (KTKVLVVQPK) yielded Km and kcat values of 310 microM and 0.0060 s-1. When the P1' proline of P19/24 was replaced with p-nitro-phenylalanine (Nph), the ability of HTLV-I protease to cleave the substrate (APQVLNphVMHPL) was improved. Inhibition of HTLV-I protease and His-protease by a series of protease inhibitors was also tested. It was found that the Ki values for inhibition of HTLV-I protease and His-protease by a series of pepsin inhibitors ranged from 7 nM to 10 microM, while the Ki values of a series of HIV-1 protease inhibitors ranged from 6 nM to 127 microM. In comparison, the Ki values for inhibition of pepsin by the pepsin inhibitors ranged from 0.72 to 19.2 nM, and the Ki values for inhibition of HIV-1 protease by the HIV protease inhibitors ranged from 0.24 nM to 1.0 microM. The data suggested that the substrate binding site of HTLV-I protease is different from the substrate binding sites of pepsin and HIV-1 protease, and that currently employed HIV-1 protease inhibitors would not be effective for the treatment of HTLV-I infections.","['Ding, Y S', 'Rich, D H', 'Ikeda, R A']","['Ding YS', 'Rich DH', 'Ikeda RA']","['School of Chemistry and Biochemistry, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta 30332-0400, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,Biochemistry,Biochemistry,0370623,"['0 (HIV Protease Inhibitors)', '0 (MES13-099)', '0 (Oligopeptides)', '0 (Protease Inhibitors)', '0 (Protein Sorting Signals)', '0 (Pyrones)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '132748-20-0 (JG 365)', '4QD397987E (Histidine)', 'EC 3.4.23.- (Aspartic Acid Endopeptidases)', 'EC 3.4.23.- (HTLV-1 protease)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Aspartic Acid Endopeptidases/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'Enzyme Activation', 'HIV Protease Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Histidine/genetics', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*enzymology', 'Humans', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Oligopeptides/pharmacology', 'Protease Inhibitors/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Protein Sorting Signals/genetics', 'Pyrones/pharmacology', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Substrate Specificity']",1998/12/23 00:00,1998/12/23 00:01,['1998/12/23 00:00'],"['1998/12/23 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/12/23 00:01 [medline]', '1998/12/23 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1021/bi982004a [doi]', 'bi982004a [pii]']",ppublish,Biochemistry. 1998 Dec 15;37(50):17514-8. doi: 10.1021/bi982004a.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Small bowel x-rays revealed a stricture of the mid-jejunum. Push enteroscopy found a polypoid mass at 1 meter of the ligament of Treitz. Histopathological examination of the biopsy and surgical specimens showed a diffuse infiltrate of the mucosa made of medium to large cells, which were stained on immunohistochemistry by the leucocyte marker CD45 and the histiocyte/monocyte marker CD68 but were negative for the B and T cell markers. Cytological examination of the ascitic fluid revealed many myelobasts with cytoplasmic Auer rods and positive myeloperoxidase staining. There was no evidence of blood or bone marrow involvement suggestive of acute leukemia or myeloproliferative disorders. These findings were consistent with the diagnosis of preleukemic granulocytic sarcoma (or chloroma). Chemotherapy led to complete remission, but 21 months later the patient developed an acute myeloid leukemia. He died from aspergillus pneumonitis, 10 months after bone marrow allograft. Preleukemic granulocytic sarcoma of the small bowel is a rare condition and its diagnosis is usually not easy, requiring histochemical or immunohistochemical studies. Most cases have progressed to acute myeloid leukemia.","['Corpechot, C', 'Lemann, M', 'Brocheriou, I', 'Mariette, X', 'Bonnet, J', 'Daniel, M T', 'Bertheau, P', 'Lavergne, A', 'Modigliani, R']","['Corpechot C', 'Lemann M', 'Brocheriou I', 'Mariette X', 'Bonnet J', 'Daniel MT', 'Bertheau P', 'Lavergne A', 'Modigliani R']","['Service de Gastroenterologie, Hopitaux Saint-Louis and Lariboisiere, Paris, France.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Am J Gastroenterol,The American journal of gastroenterology,0421030,,IM,"['Adult', 'Endoscopy', 'Humans', 'Intestinal Neoplasms/*complications/pathology', 'Intestinal Obstruction/diagnostic imaging/*etiology', '*Intestine, Small/diagnostic imaging', '*Jejunum/pathology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*complications/pathology', 'Male', 'Radiography']",1998/12/22 00:00,1998/12/22 00:01,['1998/12/22 00:00'],"['1998/12/22 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/12/22 00:01 [medline]', '1998/12/22 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0002-9270(98)00607-8 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1572-0241.1998.00726.x [doi]']",ppublish,Am J Gastroenterol. 1998 Dec;93(12):2586-8. doi: 10.1111/j.1572-0241.1998.00726.x.,,,,11,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHOD: A 54-year-old woman with an acute lymphoblastic leukemia had acute abdominal pain with peritoneal symptoms during her hospital stay. A laparotomy was performed and a cecal infarct firmly adherent to about 30 cm of infiltrated jejunal loop was discovered. RESULTS: Microscopic studies revealed an infiltration of the jejunal wall by abnormal lymphocytes. The cecal and ileal walls were infiltrated by leukocytes. Blood vessels were invaded by giant cells and large, unseptated, right-angle branching hyphea.

Surgeons are involved infrequently in the management of such patients, and yet occasionally are called upon to operate on critically ill patients with refractory disease. This article reviews the salient features of this condition and discusses possible indications for surgery. METHOD: Two cases of intestinal graft-versus-host disease that required laparotomy are presented. RESULTS: A 24-year-old male with severe, unremitting, acute intestinal graft-versus-host disease underwent small-bowel and large-bowel resections for massive bleeding. A 35-year-old male with recurrent symptoms of small-bowel obstruction after allogeneic bone marrow transplantation underwent small-bowel resection and multiple strictureplasties for chronic intestinal graft-versus-host disease.

The effect was greatly potentiated by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate at a concentration where neither phorbol ester nor ciprofibrate alone had any effect on these cells. As occurs for HL-60 cell differentiation induced by high phorbol ester concentration, the ciprofibrate-induced phorbol ester-dependent differentiation of HL-60 cells proceeded through the monocytic/macrophage pathway and induced the phosphorylation of proteins with similar molecular weights suggesting that increased protein kinase C activity may be involved in the effect.

The patients achieving complete remission received autologous bone marrow transplantation or (if > 50 years or refusing autologous bone marrow transplantation) high-dose Ara-C, as late intensification. Fifty-two patients (82.5%) achieved complete remission, 45 after one induction course and 16 of them underwent autologous bone marrow transplantation a median of 11 months later. As of December 1997 (median follow-up 112 months, range 50-135 months), 16 patients were still in complete remission (10 after autologous bone marrow transplantation, 6 after high-dose Ara-C) and 29 had relapsed (median time to relapse 14 months, range 2-75 months). Four patients died in complete remission. The median disease-free survival was 25 months; the 50-months and 10-year disease-free survival were 41% and 35% respectively. No significant differences were observed between the autologous bone marrow transplantation and high-dose Ara-C treated patients whose complete remission had lasted more than 11 months. The median disease-free survival in the autografted patients had not been reached after 120 months (the 50-month and 10-year disease-free survival chances were both 67%). Age was the only predictive variable for leukemic relapse. These long-term results confirm the antileukemic efficacy of an idarubicin-containing protocol, which led to high complete remission rates and favorably influenced disease-free survival. Furthermore, the efficacy of late intensification treatment with either autologous bone marrow transplantation or high-dose Ara-C is underscored. The disease-free survival chances after autologous bone marrow transplantation are comparable with those published for allogeneic bone marrow transplantation; however, disease-free survival of the patients receiving a high-dose Ara-C intensification regimen is not significantly worse than that seen after autologous bone marrow transplantation.","['Deliliers, G L', 'Annaloro, C', 'Oriani, A', 'Della Volpe, A', 'Boschetti, C', 'Cortelezzi, A', 'Maiolo, A T']","['Deliliers GL', 'Annaloro C', 'Oriani A', 'Della Volpe A', 'Boschetti C', 'Cortelezzi A', 'Maiolo AT']","['Cattedra di Medicina Interna, Ospedale Maggiore IRCCS e Universita degli Studi di Milano.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article']",Italy,Ann Ital Med Int,Annali italiani di medicina interna : organo ufficiale della Societa italiana di medicina interna,8806705,"['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', 'ZRP63D75JW (Idarubicin)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Idarubicin/administration & dosage', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Remission Induction']",1998/12/22 00:00,1998/12/22 00:01,['1998/12/22 00:00'],"['1998/12/22 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/12/22 00:01 [medline]', '1998/12/22 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Ann Ital Med Int. 1998 Jul-Sep;13(3):146-51.,,['Ann Ital Med Int. 1998 Jul-Sep;13(3):137-8.

Clinical parameters, analytical profiles, peripheral hematologic data, radiologic data and histological study were collected. Following Metcalfe's criteria, the patients were classified in 4 groups: a) group 1, indolent mastocytosis; b) group 2, hematologic disorders; c) group 3, aggressive lymphadenopathic mastocytosis with eosinophilia, and d) group 4, mastocytic leukemia. The average age at diagnosis was 52.4 years, range 25-83, and 64% were females. The mean follow-up was 2 yr. In most of the cases (71.4%) the initial complaint was urticaria pigmentosa. The predominant clinical features were pruriginous-eritematous skin lesions (in 11 cases), and digestive symptoms (in 10 patients). The most usual biochemical disorder was the rise of serum alkaline phosphatase level (in 8 patients), while lactate-dehydrogenase (LDH) was normal in all the cases. The most striking roentgenologic features were oteopenia, observed in 50% of our patients. Pheripherical hematological disorders were discovered in 8 patients (64.3%) and in one of them circulating mast-cells were observed. The bone marrow was involved in all patients (100%) and in two of them mielodysplasic features were found. The diagnostic of SM is difficult in the absence of skin lesions. The skin lesions are very common in systemic mastocytosis. Bone marrow involvement is constant, so its study has a high diagnostic rentability.","['Garcia-Erce, J A', 'Giraldo, P', 'de Vicente, P', 'Alvarez, R', 'Losfablos, F', 'Velilla, J', 'Mayayo, P', 'Rubio-Felix, D', 'Giralt, M']","['Garcia-Erce JA', 'Giraldo P', 'de Vicente P', 'Alvarez R', 'Losfablos F', 'Velilla J', 'Mayayo P', 'Rubio-Felix D', 'Giralt M']","['Servicio de Hematologia y Hemoterapia, Hospital Miguel Servet, Zaragoza.']",['spa'],"['Case Reports', 'English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Spain,Med Clin (Barc),Medicina clinica,0376377,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', '*Mastocytosis/diagnosis/etiology/metabolism/pathology', 'Middle Aged']",1998/12/22 00:00,1998/12/22 00:01,['1998/12/22 00:00'],"['1998/12/22 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/12/22 00:01 [medline]', '1998/12/22 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Med Clin (Barc). 1998 Oct 24;111(13):499-502.,,,,,Mastocitosis sistemica.

HL-60 promyelocytic leukemia cells differentiate to monocytes upon treatment with calcitriol. We describe here, that PI3-K inhibitors are able to block the differentiation induced by calcitriol in HL-60 cells. Also the downstream effector of PI3-K, p70S6K ribosomal protein kinase seems to be involved in HL-60 cell differentiation. PKC alpha and PKC delta are activated and translocated to the nucleus upon exposure of cells to calcitriol. However in our experiments the inhibition of PKC did not result in an inhibition of calcitriol induced differentiation of HL-60 cells.

Indeed, megakaryocyte volume is inversely correlated to the platelet count not only in normal individuals and immune thrombocytopenic purpura patients, but also, and surprisingly, in chronic myeloid leukemia patients. Patients with polycythemia vera and essential thrombocythemia are located outside this regression line. Herein, we describe morphometrical data confirmed by the flow cytometric measurement of the megakaryocyte endomitotic index (EI). The EI is a value which reflects the mean ploidy of megakaryocytes and corresponds to the mean of ( inverted question marklog2 DNA content expressed in N inverted question mark-1). In this study, the megakaryocyte endomitotic index of 14 normal individuals was compared to those of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) patients (n = 16), immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) patients (n = 11), essential thrombocythemia (ET) patients (n = 10) and polycythemia vera (PV) patients (n = 12). The megakaryocyte EI was significantly lower in CML patients than in normal individuals. In contrast, in ET, PV and ITP patients, megakaryocyte EI was higher than in normal individuals. An inverse relationship between the endomitotic index estimated by flow cytometry and the mean megakaryocyte volume performed by morphometry was observed in normal individuals, CML and ITP patients. In conclusion, the endomitotic index is higher in ITP, ET and PV patients and lower in CML patients when compared to normal individuals and is an interesting tool which can help to diagnose rapidly hematological disorders with abnormal platelet counts.","['Baatout, S', 'Chatelain, B', 'Staquet, P', 'Symann, M', 'Chatelain, C']","['Baatout S', 'Chatelain B', 'Staquet P', 'Symann M', 'Chatelain C']","['Laboratory of Experimental Hematology and Oncology, UCL, Brussels, Belgium. sbaatout@sckcen.be']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Greece,Anticancer Res,Anticancer research,8102988,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Hematologic Diseases/blood/*diagnosis/pathology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/blood/diagnosis/pathology', 'Male', '*Megakaryocytes/pathology', 'Middle Aged', '*Mitotic Index', 'Platelet Count', '*Ploidies', 'Polycythemia Vera/blood/diagnosis/pathology', 'Purpura, Thrombocytopenic, Idiopathic/blood/diagnosis/pathology', 'Thrombocythemia, Essential/blood/diagnosis/pathology']",1998/12/22 00:00,1998/12/22 00:01,['1998/12/22 00:00'],"['1998/12/22 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/12/22 00:01 [medline]', '1998/12/22 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Anticancer Res. 1998 Sep-Oct;18(5A):3347-53.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Using several human tumor cell lines adapted to growth in low folate medium, folic acid was shown to be 100- to 1000-fold less active than folinic acid at protecting cells from LY231514-induced cytotoxicity. The lethality of LY231514 was compared in mice maintained on standard diet or low folate diet. The LD50 occurred at 60- and 250-fold lower doses of LY231514 in DBA/2 and CD1 nu/nu mice, respectively, maintained on low folate diet compared to standard diet. The L5178Y/TK-/HX-murine lymphoma was much more sensitive to the antitumor action of LY231514 compared to wild type L5178Y-S tumors. For mice on low folate diet, LY231514 at 0.3 and 1 mg/kg (qd x 10, i.p.) produced 100% inhibition of L5178Y/TK-/HX-lymphoma growth, and significant lethality occurred at > or = 3 mg/kg.

The combination that induced the highest thymidine incorporation was chosen as the OMC for each patient. Among 14 mitogen combinations tested, there were six different OMCs, of which the most frequent was TNF-alpha + IL-2. It was the OMC in 9 of 24 cases. The other OMCs were TNF-alpha + TPA1 (5/24), SAC + IL-2 (5/24), TPA1 + IL-2 (3/24), TPA10 + IL-2 (1/24), and TNF-alpha + TPA10 + IL-1 (1/24). The mitogenic power of the selected OMC in each case was then evaluated both by the combination of immunophenotyping and molecular cytogenetic techniques known as MAC (Morphology, Antibody, Chromosomes) and standard chromosome analysis. After OMC stimulation, the levels of DNA synthesis and B-cell proliferation (mitotic index) were, on average, 10-fold higher than those observed after standard TPA stimulation (P < 0. 0001). The proportion of mitotic B cells exceeded the proportion of mitotic T cells in 70.1% of the cases after OMC stimulation. After TPA stimulation, 7.7% +/- 2.5% of all mitoses were B-cell mitoses, whereas after OMC stimulation this proportion rose to 57.9% +/- 5.3%. The frequency of clonal chromosomal aberrations increased from 46% after TPA stimulation to 79% after OMC stimulation. The clonal aberrations del(6q), del(11q), and/or del(13q) were observed in 26%, 32%, and 42% of the patients with the respective clonal chromosomal aberrations, whereas the corresponding frequencies after TPA stimulation were only 4%, 21%, and 17%. When the lineage involvement of cells with clonal chromosomal aberrations from three patients was analyzed, the aberrations were found to be restricted to B cells only, and in one patient to a minor subset of B cells. The results demonstrate that an individually chosen OMC induces a high rate of proliferation in neoplastic B cells. We found deletions in 6q, 11q, and 13q at higher frequencies than reported previously, most probably as a result of an improved mitogenic response. The identification of an optimal mitogen stimulation for each patient, prior to chromosome analysis, can well be expected to reduce the rate of false-normal results in the future. This is essential for accurate evaluation of the prognostic significance of chromosomal aberrations in B-CLL.","['Larramendy, M L', 'Siitonen, S M', 'Zhu, Y', 'Hurme, M', 'Vilpo, L', 'Vilpo, J A', 'Knuutila, S']","['Larramendy ML', 'Siitonen SM', 'Zhu Y', 'Hurme M', 'Vilpo L', 'Vilpo JA', 'Knuutila S']","['Department of Medical Genetics, Haartman Institute, University of Helsinki, Helsinki (Finland).']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Switzerland,Cytogenet Cell Genet,Cytogenetics and cell genetics,0367735,"['0 (Carcinogens)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Mitogens)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Aged', 'B-Lymphocytes/cytology', 'Carcinogens/pharmacology', 'Cell Lineage/drug effects/genetics', 'Chromosome Aberrations', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 11', 'DNA, Neoplasm/analysis', 'Female', 'Gene Deletion', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-2/pharmacology', 'Interphase/drug effects/genetics', 'Leukemia, B-Cell/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mitogens/*pharmacology', 'Mitosis/drug effects/*genetics', 'T-Lymphocytes/cytology', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/pharmacology']",1998/12/22 03:02,2000/08/16 11:00,['1998/12/22 03:02'],"['1998/12/22 03:02 [pubmed]', '2000/08/16 11:00 [medline]', '1998/12/22 03:02 [entrez]']","['ccg82215 [pii]', '10.1159/000015103 [doi]']",ppublish,Cytogenet Cell Genet. 1998;82(3-4):215-21. doi: 10.1159/000015103.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

For this reason, the known DNA sequence between the paired and homeoboxes was analysed for the presence of a conserved DNA motif to which a modifying protein could bind in order to direct the methylation or demethylation of surrounding gene sequences. The octapeptide-encoding region was found to contain several nucleotides that were highly conserved throughout the Pax gene family from phylogenetically distant species. The most conserved nucleotides are thought to comprise a motif TN8TCCT where N8=any combination of eight nucleotides. A conserved octapeptide-like-encoding sequence containing the TN8TCCT motif was also found in non-Pax genes of higher eukaryotes and in the non-coding strand of plants. Moreover, differential methylation seems to be associated with the presence of the TN8TCCT motif in p53 and the human oestrogen receptor genes. The presence of the TN8TCCT motif within an octapeptide-like-encoding sequence in human T-cell leukaemia virus type 1 might suggest that the putative recognition motif may have been introduced into various host genomes via some form of retroviral agent.","['Ziman, M R', 'Kay, P H']","['Ziman MR', 'Kay PH']","['Department of Pathology, The University of Western Australia, Nedlands, Western Australia, 6009, Australia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Gene,Gene,7706761,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (Muscle Proteins)', '0 (Nerve Tissue Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (PAX7 Transcription Factor)', '0 (PAX7 protein, human)', '0 (PAX8 Transcription Factor)', '0 (PAX8 protein, human)', '0 (Paired Box Transcription Factors)', '0 (Receptors, Estrogen)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '8J337D1HZY (Cytosine)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', '*Conserved Sequence', 'Cytosine/*metabolism', 'DNA Methylation', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics', 'Genes, p53', '*Homeodomain Proteins', 'Humans', 'Multigene Family', 'Muscle Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Nerve Tissue Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', '*Nuclear Proteins', 'PAX7 Transcription Factor', 'PAX8 Transcription Factor', 'Paired Box Transcription Factors', 'Receptors, Estrogen/genetics/metabolism', 'Trans-Activators/genetics']",1998/12/22 00:00,1998/12/22 00:01,['1998/12/22 00:00'],"['1998/12/22 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/12/22 00:01 [medline]', '1998/12/22 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0378-1119(98)00162-0 [pii]', '10.1016/s0378-1119(98)00162-0 [doi]']",ppublish,Gene. 1998 Nov 26;223(1-2):303-8. doi: 10.1016/s0378-1119(98)00162-0.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We investigated the cytogenotoxic effects of crocidolite in a human mesothelioma cell line, MSTO211H, and a human promyelocytic leukemia cell line, HL60. Using confocal laser scanning microscopy, we found that the MSTO211H cells had phagocytotic activity, whereas the HL60 cells did not. In the MSTO211H cells, crocidolite decreased the cell population and increased the numbers of polynucleated cells (PN) and tetraploid cells, and increased the coefficients of variation (CV) of DNA contents in G0/G1 cells and the formation of 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine. In contrast, crocidolite showed none of these cytogenotoxic effects in HL60 cells. To investigate the importance of phagocytosis in the cytogenotoxicity of crocidolite, we sorted the crocidolite-phagocytosed cells from less-phagocytosed cells by fluorescence-activated cell sorting, and studied the differences in cytogenotoxicity between these two cell groups. We found significant increases in the numbers of PN and tetraploid cells and the CV in the crocidolite-phagocytosed cells compared to the less-phagocytosed cells. These findings indicate that MSTO211H cells are susceptible to the cytogenotoxic effects of asbestos due to their phagocytotic activity, and that the MSTO211H cell line is suitable for the detection of such effects on human cells by asbestos and other materials which need to be phagocytosed to exert their toxicity.","['Takeuchi, T', 'Nakajima, M', 'Morimoto, K']","['Takeuchi T', 'Nakajima M', 'Morimoto K']","['Department of Hygiene and Preventive Medicine, Osaka University School of Medicine, 2-2 Yamada-oka, Suita, Osaka 565, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",Netherlands,Mutat Res,Mutation research,0400763,"['0 (Mutagens)', '12001-28-4 (Asbestos, Crocidolite)', '1332-21-4 (Asbestos)', ""88847-89-6 (8-Hydroxy-2'-Deoxyguanosine)"", 'G9481N71RO (Deoxyguanosine)']",IM,"[""8-Hydroxy-2'-Deoxyguanosine"", 'Asbestos/toxicity', 'Asbestos, Crocidolite/*toxicity', 'Cell Division/*drug effects', 'Deoxyguanosine/analogs & derivatives/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Mesothelioma/genetics', 'Microscopy, Confocal', '*Mutagenicity Tests', 'Mutagens/*toxicity', 'Neutrophils/drug effects', 'Phagocytosis/*drug effects', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1998/12/22 00:00,1998/12/22 00:01,['1998/12/22 00:00'],"['1998/12/22 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/12/22 00:01 [medline]', '1998/12/22 00:00 [entrez]']","['S1383-5718(98)00163-6 [pii]', '10.1016/s1383-5718(98)00163-6 [doi]']",ppublish,Mutat Res. 1999 Jan 2;438(1):63-70. doi: 10.1016/s1383-5718(98)00163-6.,,,,,,['Copyright 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here we demonstrate that the NUP98-HOXA9 fusion gene encodes two nuclear oncoproteins with either 19 or 37 NUP98 FG repeats fused to the DNA binding and PBX heterodimerization domains of the transcription factor HOXA9. Both NUP98-HOXA9 chimeras transformed NIH 3T3 fibroblasts, and this transformation required the HOXA9 domains for DNA binding and PBX interaction. Surprisingly, the FG repeats acted as very potent transactivators of gene transcription. This NUP98-derived activity is essential for transformation and can be replaced by the bona fide transactivation domain of VP16. Interestingly, FG repeat-containing segments derived from the nucleoporins NUP153 and CAN/NUP214 functioned similarly to those from NUP98. We further demonstrate that transactivation by FG repeat-rich segments of NUP98 correlates with their ability to interact functionally and physically with the transcriptional coactivators CREB binding protein (CBP) and p300. This finding shows, for the first time, that a translocation-generated fusion protein appears to recruit CBP/p300 as an important step of its oncogenic mechanism. Together, our results suggest that NUP98-HOXA9 chimeras are aberrant transcription factors that deregulate HOX-responsive genes through the transcriptional activation properties of nucleoporin-specific FG repeats that recruit CBP/p300. Indeed, FG repeat-mediated transactivation may be a shared pathogenic function of nucleoporins implicated human AML.","['Kasper, L H', 'Brindle, P K', 'Schnabel, C A', 'Pritchard, C E', 'Cleary, M L', 'van Deursen, J M']","['Kasper LH', 'Brindle PK', 'Schnabel CA', 'Pritchard CE', 'Cleary ML', 'van Deursen JM']","[""Departments of Genetics, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee 38105, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (NUP214 protein, human)', '0 (Nuclear Pore Complex Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Nup214 protein, mouse)', '0 (Pre-B-Cell Leukemia Transcription Factor 1)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (homeobox protein HOXA9)', '0 (nuclear pore complex protein 98)', '0 (pbx1 protein, human)', '47E5O17Y3R (Phenylalanine)', 'EC 2.3.1.48 (CREB-Binding Protein)', 'EC 2.3.1.48 (CREBBP protein, human)', 'EC 2.3.1.48 (Crebbp protein, mouse)', 'TE7660XO1C (Glycine)']",IM,"['3T3 Cells', 'Animals', 'Artificial Gene Fusion', 'CREB-Binding Protein', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Dimerization', 'Glycine/*metabolism', 'Homeodomain Proteins/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Membrane Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Mice', '*Nuclear Pore Complex Proteins', 'Nuclear Proteins/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Phenylalanine/*metabolism', 'Pre-B-Cell Leukemia Transcription Factor 1', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Trans-Activators/*metabolism', '*Transcription, Genetic', 'Transcriptional Activation']",1998/12/22 00:00,1998/12/22 00:01,['1998/12/22 00:00'],"['1998/12/22 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/12/22 00:01 [medline]', '1998/12/22 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/MCB.19.1.764 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 1999 Jan;19(1):764-76. doi: 10.1128/MCB.19.1.764.,"['CA-42971/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-21765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA77262-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,PMC83933,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, we present evidence that transcription of the Fli-1 gene is positively regulated by Spi-1/PU.1 in SFFV-transformed cell lines: (i) all SFFV-transformed cell lines expressing Spi-1/PU.1 are characterized by a specific pattern of Fli-1 gene transcripts initiated in the -200 region instead of position -400 as reported for F-MuLV-transformed cell lines; (ii) these Fli-1 transcripts initiated in the -200 region are downregulated in parallel with that of Spi-1/PU.1 during hexamethylenebisacetamide (HMBA) induced differentiation; and (iii) Fli-1 transcription is upregulated in SFFV cells lines following stable transfection of a Spi-1/PU.1 expression vector. Furthermore, we found by transient transfection assays that the -270/-41 region of the Fli-1 gene displays promoter activity which is transactivated by Spi-1/PU.1. This promoter is strictly dependent on the integrity of two highly conserved ETS DNA binding sites that bind the Spi-1/PU.1 protein in vitro. Finally, we show that transfection of constitutive or inducible Fli-1 expression vectors in SFFV-transformed cells inhibits their erythroid differentiation induced by HMBA. Overall, these data indicate that Fli-1 is a target gene of the Spi-1/PU.1 transcription factor in SFFV-transformed cell lines. We further suggest that deregulated synthesis of Fli-1 may trigger a common mechanism contributing to erythroleukemia induced by either SFFV or F-MuLV.","['Starck, J', 'Doubeikovski, A', 'Sarrazin, S', 'Gonnet, C', 'Rao, G', 'Skoultchi, A', 'Godet, J', 'Dusanter-Fourt, I', 'Morle, F']","['Starck J', 'Doubeikovski A', 'Sarrazin S', 'Gonnet C', 'Rao G', 'Skoultchi A', 'Godet J', 'Dusanter-Fourt I', 'Morle F']","['Centre de Genetique Moleculaire et Cellulaire, CNRS UMR 5534, 69622 Villeurbanne, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Fli1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Protein c-fli-1)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (proto-oncogene protein Spi-1)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Binding Sites', 'Cell Line, Transformed', 'Conserved Sequence', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Erythroid Precursor Cells/*cytology', '*Erythropoiesis', 'Friend murine leukemia virus', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Proto-Oncogene Protein c-fli-1', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Spleen Focus-Forming Viruses/genetics', 'Trans-Activators/biosynthesis/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Xenopus']",1998/12/22 00:00,1998/12/22 00:01,['1998/12/22 00:00'],"['1998/12/22 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/12/22 00:01 [medline]', '1998/12/22 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/MCB.19.1.121 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 1999 Jan;19(1):121-35. doi: 10.1128/MCB.19.1.121.,['CA16368/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,PMC83871,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The chick ciliary ganglion (CG), where OD occurs between embryonic days (E) 6 and 10, was employed as a model system. We show that CG neurons (E8) are immunoreactive (ir) for TGF-beta2 and -beta3 as well as the TGF-beta receptor TbetaR-II, but are not ir for TGF-beta1. Ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF) and fibroblast growth factor (FGF)-2, established neurotrophic molecules for CG neurons, up-regulate TGF-beta3 mRNA and TGF-beta biological activity in cultures of E8 CG neurons. None of the TGF-beta isoforms--beta1, beta2, or beta3--has a trophic, survival-promoting effect on cultured CG neurons. However, all isoforms enhance CG neuron survival mediated by CNTF or FGF-2, significantly and over a wide range of concentrations. In combination with the neurotrophins (NT) nerve growth factor (NGF) and NT-3, which are not neurotrophic for CG neurons, TGF-beta significantly promotes CG neuron survival. However, TGF-beta does not act synergistically with the neuropoietic cytokines oncostatin M, leukemia inhibiting factor, or interleukin-6. Immunoneutralization of endogenous TGF-beta released from CG neurons using an antibody to TGF-beta1/-beta2/-beta3 significantly reduces the potency of CNTF or FGF-2 to promote CG neuron survival. The blocking effect of the anti-pan-TGF-beta antibody could be rescued by adding exogenous TGF-beta. Together, these data suggest that para-/autocrine TGF-beta signaling has an important effect on the regulation of neuron survival in a model system of peripheral neurons.","['Krieglstein, K', 'Farkas, L', 'Unsicker, K']","['Krieglstein K', 'Farkas L', 'Unsicker K']","['Department of Anatomy and Cell Biology, University of Heidelberg, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Neurobiol,Journal of neurobiology,0213640,"['0 (Antibodies)', '0 (Ciliary Neurotrophic Factor)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Nerve Growth Factors)', '0 (Nerve Tissue Proteins)', '0 (Neurotrophin 3)', '0 (Peptides)', '0 (Protein Isoforms)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Transforming Growth Factor beta)', '0 (Transforming Growth Factor beta)', '103107-01-3 (Fibroblast Growth Factor 2)', '106956-32-5 (Oncostatin M)', 'P658DCA9XD (neurotrophin 4)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies/immunology', 'Cell Communication/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chick Embryo', 'Ciliary Neurotrophic Factor', 'Fibroblast Growth Factor 2/antagonists & inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Ganglia, Parasympathetic/cytology/*embryology', 'Growth Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Interleukin-6/pharmacology', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Lymphokines/pharmacology', 'Nerve Growth Factors/*pharmacology', 'Nerve Tissue Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Neurons/*cytology', 'Neurotrophin 3', 'Oncostatin M', 'Peptides/pharmacology', 'Protein Isoforms/genetics/metabolism/pharmacology', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Receptors, Transforming Growth Factor beta/metabolism', 'Transforming Growth Factor beta/genetics/immunology/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Up-Regulation/drug effects']",1998/12/19 03:02,2000/06/20 09:00,['1998/12/19 03:02'],"['1998/12/19 03:02 [pubmed]', '2000/06/20 09:00 [medline]', '1998/12/19 03:02 [entrez]']",['10.1002/(SICI)1097-4695(199812)37:4<563::AID-NEU5>3.0.CO;2-A [pii]'],ppublish,J Neurobiol. 1998 Dec;37(4):563-72.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, little is known concerning the roles of the fibronectin (FN)/VLA-4 interaction in the proliferation of human B cells. In this study we investigated the effect of immobilized FN on the proliferation of various B-cell lines, including a newly-established B-cell line, OPM-3, and human tonsillar B cells, that primarily express VLA-4 but not VLA-5. Immobilized FN significantly promoted the proliferation of OPM-3 cells and normal B cells via VLA-4. The cross-linking of beta1 integrins of OPM-3 cells resulted in the phosphorylation of the focal adhesion kinase (FAK) associated 90 kD protein, an increase in FAK-associated kinase activity, and the phosphorylation of Raf-1. Furthermore, the MEK1 inhibitor, PD98059, inhibited the FN-promoted proliferation of OPM-3 cells. These results demonstrate that the FN/VLA-4 interaction transmits the growth signal(s) which may be mediated by Ras pathway in OPM-3 cells, and suggest that OPM-3 cells may be of great value in studying the roles of the FN/VLA-4 interaction in human B-cell growth.","['Yoshida, H', 'Nishiura, T', 'Karasuno, T', 'Matsumura, I', 'Ishikawa, J', 'Yoshimura, M', 'Yokota, T', 'Okajima, Y', 'Ogawa, M', 'Kanakura, Y', 'Tomiyama, Y', 'Matsuzawa, Y']","['Yoshida H', 'Nishiura T', 'Karasuno T', 'Matsumura I', 'Ishikawa J', 'Yoshimura M', 'Yokota T', 'Okajima Y', 'Ogawa M', 'Kanakura Y', 'Tomiyama Y', 'Matsuzawa Y']","['The Second Department of Internal Medicine, Osaka University Medical School, Suita, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (Cross-Linking Reagents)', '0 (Fibronectins)', '0 (Integrin alpha4beta1)', '0 (Integrins)', '0 (Receptors, Lymphocyte Homing)', '42HK56048U (Tyrosine)', 'EC 2.7.11.17 (Calcium-Calmodulin-Dependent Protein Kinases)']",IM,"['B-Lymphocytes/*pathology', 'Calcium-Calmodulin-Dependent Protein Kinases/metabolism', 'Cell Division', 'Cross-Linking Reagents', 'Fibronectins/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Integrin alpha4beta1', 'Integrins/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, B-Cell/*pathology', 'Receptors, Lymphocyte Homing/*metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tyrosine/metabolism']",1998/12/19 00:00,1998/12/19 00:01,['1998/12/19 00:00'],"['1998/12/19 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/12/19 00:01 [medline]', '1998/12/19 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1046/j.1365-2141.1998.01049.x [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 1998 Dec;103(3):804-12. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2141.1998.01049.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Growth of two out of four HTLV-I-infected T-cell lines was also inhibited by 1.0 micromol/l RA, but to a lesser extent than by As2O3. The mechanism of this growth inhibition was due to the induction of apoptosis. Apoptosis was also induced in fresh ATL cells from patients by AS2O3, but far less by RA.

In conclusion, As2O3 has therapeutic potential for the treatment of ATL and may be far more clinically beneficial than RA.","['Ishitsuka, K', 'Hanada, S', 'Suzuki, S', 'Utsunomiya, A', 'Chyuman, Y', 'Takeuchi, S', 'Takeshita, T', 'Shimotakahara, S', 'Uozumi, K', 'Makino, T', 'Arima, T']","['Ishitsuka K', 'Hanada S', 'Suzuki S', 'Utsunomiya A', 'Chyuman Y', 'Takeuchi S', 'Takeshita T', 'Shimotakahara S', 'Uozumi K', 'Makino T', 'Arima T']","['Second Department of Internal Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Kagoshima University, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (Oxides)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals/*therapeutic use', 'Cell Division', 'HTLV-I Infections/*drug therapy/pathology/virology', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*growth & development', 'Humans', 'Oxides/*therapeutic use', 'T-Lymphocytes/pathology/virology', 'Tretinoin/*therapeutic use', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1998/12/19 00:00,1998/12/19 00:01,['1998/12/19 00:00'],"['1998/12/19 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/12/19 00:01 [medline]', '1998/12/19 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1046/j.1365-2141.1998.01068.x [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 1998 Dec;103(3):721-8. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2141.1998.01068.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

No change in Fas expression was observed in any of the 10 cell lines after 48 h exposure to CGP57418B. AR230 cells were resistant and SD1 cells were partially resistant to Fas-mediated apoptosis induced by ligation of the Fas receptor to an anti-Fas IgM antibody. Pre-incubation with 1 microM CGP57418B did not change the susceptibility of these cell lines to Fas-mediated cell death. Similar results were observed in experiments with CD34+ cells from CML patients and from normal individuals.

Patients with CML in blast crisis, or with Philadelphia positive acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL), can have a smaller BCR-ABL fusion transcript possessing only the first exon of BCR fused to ABL. This smaller transcript encodes a 190 kD protein which is more strongly transforming than the p210 protein derived from the larger CML-associated transcript. We performed RT-PCR on samples from CML patients in chronic phase to determine the frequency and mechanism of p190 and p210 co-expression and to see if this correlated with clinical indices. We examined the peripheral blood or marrow of 67 patients with CML and found that 35 of them expressed both transcripts whereas the remainder expressed the p210-encoding transcript exclusively. Additional PCR products of an intermediate size were also frequently detected and have been isolated and sequenced. Data from two of these products indicate that they are the result of alternative splicing and include variable combinations of BCR exons. We believe that the expression of the p190-encoding transcript in the chronic phase of CML is also due to alternative splicing. A comparison of patients co-expressing the p190- and p210-encoding transcripts with those patients who expressed only the p210-encoding transcript detected significantly higher white blood cell (WBC) counts and blast cell counts at time of testing as well as significantly higher white blood cell counts at diagnosis.","['Lichty, B D', 'Keating, A', 'Callum, J', 'Yee, K', 'Croxford, R', 'Corpus, G', 'Nwachukwu, B', 'Kim, P', 'Guo, J', 'Kamel-Reid, S']","['Lichty BD', 'Keating A', 'Callum J', 'Yee K', 'Croxford R', 'Corpus G', 'Nwachukwu B', 'Kim P', 'Guo J', 'Kamel-Reid S']","['Department of Laboratory Medicine and Pathobiology, University of Toronto, Ontario Cancer Institute, Princess Margaret Hospital, Canada.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Alternative Splicing/*genetics', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*genetics', 'Gene Expression', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*genetics', 'Middle Aged', 'RNA, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction/methods']",1998/12/19 00:00,1998/12/19 00:01,['1998/12/19 00:00'],"['1998/12/19 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/12/19 00:01 [medline]', '1998/12/19 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1046/j.1365-2141.1998.01033.x [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 1998 Dec;103(3):711-5. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2141.1998.01033.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The findings show that in patients with nodular sclerosing histopathology there was a highly significant circannual rhythm with a low amplitude (extent of seasonal variation) and a peak in March. A significant, but different, rhythm with a high amplitude and a peak in August was found in lymphocyte predominant Hodgkin's disease. However, this finding is less certain, due to smaller numbers and a lower significance level. The main conclusion is that there is a highly significant seasonality in nodular sclerosing Hodgkin's disease. The findings provide further evidence that nodular sclerosing and lymphocyte predominant may be two different diseases.

We have previously shown that RET gene expression in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) occurs more frequently in AMLs displaying either a monocytic (FAB M4/M5) or intermediate-mature myeloid phenotype (FAB M2/M3) than in leukemias reflecting an earlier stage of myeloid differentiation (FAB M0/M1). To further verify the association between RET expression and the relative maturation stage of AML cells, we have performed a quantitative estimation of relative abundances of RET transcripts among various FAB subtypes of AMLs. By analyzing 13 AML samples and normal hematopoietic cells through a competitive-quantitative RT-PCR approach, we were able to show that the relative levels of RET-specific mRNAs continuously increase with blast cell maturation in human AML, i.e., the amounts of RET gene-specific transcripts differ among RET-expressing AMLs, being higher in the more differentiated FAB phenotypes. In addition, we provide evidence that the relative amounts of RET transcripts increase upon in vitro and in vivo differentiation of leukemic promyelocytes from FAB M3 AML patients, becoming overall comparable to those found in normal granulocytes. These results indicate that RET expression in human AMLs is maturation-associated, probably mirroring the developmental regulation of this gene during differentiation of normal hematopoietic cells.","['Gattei, V', 'Degan, M', 'Aldinucci, D', 'De Iuliis, A', 'Rossi, F M', 'Mazzocco, F T', 'Rupolo, M', 'Zagonel, V', 'Pinto, A']","['Gattei V', 'Degan M', 'Aldinucci D', 'De Iuliis A', 'Rossi FM', 'Mazzocco FT', 'Rupolo M', 'Zagonel V', 'Pinto A']","['Division of Medical Oncology, Centro di Riferimento Oncologico, Istituto Nazionale di Ricovero e Cura a Carattere Scientifico, Aviano, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Ann Hematol,Annals of hematology,9107334,"['0 (Drosophila Proteins)', '0 (MAS1 protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Mas)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-ret)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Ret protein, Drosophila)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Aged', '*Drosophila Proteins', 'Gene Expression', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*genetics/pathology', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/genetics/pathology', 'Proto-Oncogene Mas', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-ret', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*genetics', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction']",1998/12/19 00:00,1998/12/19 00:01,['1998/12/19 00:00'],"['1998/12/19 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/12/19 00:01 [medline]', '1998/12/19 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s002770050444 [doi]'],ppublish,Ann Hematol. 1998 Nov;77(5):207-10. doi: 10.1007/s002770050444.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Non-small cell lung cancer patients whose tumors have neuroendocrine (NE) features may be more responsive to chemotherapy. In addition, increased expression of HER2 (c-erbB-2), a membrane-bound receptor with tyrosine kinase activity, has been associated with shortened survival. The Cancer and Leukemia Group B (CALGB) performed a study of patients with stage IIIA (N2 nodes positive) non-small cell lung cancer in which patients received initial chemotherapy followed by surgery, then post-operative therapy consisting of sequential chemotherapy and radiation therapy. Since all patients underwent mediastinoscopy, this provided an opportunity to compare pre- and post-chemotherapy tumor specimens to test the hypothesis that these proteins would predict treatment response. In particular, we hypothesized that the post-chemotherapy specimens would be enriched for NE marker negative cells because of the increased sensitivity of NE positive cells to chemotherapy. We performed immunohistochemical analysis for a panel of NE markers [neuron-specific enolase (NSE), Leu-7, chromogranin A (ChrA), synaptophysin (Syn)], HER2 and CEA to determine if there was an effect of therapy on the percentage of cells expressing these markers. Secondary endpoints were a correlation with chemotherapy response and survival. Slides were scored for intensity (0-4) and percentage of cells positive (0-4). Of 61 eligible patients, there were 38 with both pre- and post-chemotherapy specimens. When both intensity of staining and percentage of positive cells were considered, post-chemotherapy specimens had a higher percentage of positive NE markers compared with pre-chemotherapy. In addition, there was no correlation between NE marker, HER2 or CEA expression (prior to or post treatment) and response to chemotherapy or survival. These data do not support the hypothesis that NE positive tumor cells are preferentially killed by chemotherapy in patients with stage IIIA non-small cell lung cancer.","['Graziano, S L', 'Kern, J A', 'Herndon, J E', 'Tatum, A', 'Brisson, M L', 'Memoli, V', 'Sugarbaker, D', 'Skarin, A T', 'Kreisman, H', 'Green, M R']","['Graziano SL', 'Kern JA', 'Herndon JE', 'Tatum A', 'Brisson ML', 'Memoli V', 'Sugarbaker D', 'Skarin AT', 'Kreisman H', 'Green MR']","['Department of Medicine, SUNY-Health Science Center and Veterans Affairs Medical Center, Syracuse, NY 13210, USA.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Clinical Trial, Phase II', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Ireland,Lung Cancer,"Lung cancer (Amsterdam, Netherlands)",8800805,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Carcinoembryonic Antigen)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor, ErbB-2)']",IM,"['Biomarkers, Tumor/*analysis', 'Carcinoembryonic Antigen/*analysis', 'Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung/*chemistry/diagnosis/drug therapy/surgery', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Humans', 'Lung Neoplasms/*chemistry/diagnosis/drug therapy/surgery', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Prognosis', 'Receptor, ErbB-2/*analysis']",1998/12/19 00:00,1998/12/19 00:01,['1998/12/19 00:00'],"['1998/12/19 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/12/19 00:01 [medline]', '1998/12/19 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0169500298000634 [pii]', '10.1016/s0169-5002(98)00063-4 [doi]']",ppublish,Lung Cancer. 1998 Sep;21(3):203-11. doi: 10.1016/s0169-5002(98)00063-4.,"['CA21060/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA33601/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA47642/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Due to the program for eradication of BLV-infections in Germany the BLV incidence in cattle declined and only few new cases seem to occur per year. On the other hand, BLV-infected cattle with low, transient or without BLV-antibody titers are difficult to identify as BLV-infected. These animals may be sources for new infections. It was the aim of this study to compare the suitability of agargel-immunodiffusion (AGID), enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for diagnosis of BLV-infected cattle. We investigated a herd with 10 cows, where after a long period when the herd was negative suddenly a positive serological reaction appeared. In addition 64 animals from 6 federal states of different herds with doubtful serological reactions found in previous tests were included. In the herd with 10 cows we were able to detect BLV-infection in one animal 8 weeks earlier with PCR than with ELISA. Investigation of 56 adult cattle and 3 calves from different herds with both PCR and ELISA showed that 51 animals were positive in ELISA and 55 in PCR. Seven animal were positive in PCR and negative in ELISA. Three calves yielded negative results in PCR and positive results in ELISA. One cow which was positive in previous serological tests was negative in ELISA, AGID and PCR. Restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis demonstrated that the majority of the cattle was infected with the same BLV provirus variant. The four PCR variants used in this study yielded a similar sensitivity for BLV provirus detection. In conclusion, compared to the serological tests, PCR detects BLV-infection earlier in naturally infected cattle. The method is also a useful tool to exclude or confirm BLV-infection in cattle with doubtful serological results. PCR may be used to complement the serological tests in the diagnosis of BLV-infection.","['Beier, D', 'Blankenstein, P', 'Fechner, H']","['Beier D', 'Blankenstein P', 'Fechner H']","['Bundesforschungsanstalt fur Viruskrankheiten der Tiere, Institut fur epidemiologische Diagnostik, Wusterhausen.']",['ger'],"['Comparative Study', 'English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Germany,Dtsch Tierarztl Wochenschr,DTW.

Upon induction the overall level of phosphotyrosine-containing proteins increased. To examine the role of protein phosphorylation in HD3 cells differentiation, the cells were treated with specific inhibitors. In the presence of okadaic acid, cell proliferation was arrested and accompanied by a marked increase in haemoglobin synthesis, a differentiation marker of erythroid cells. Okadaic acid caused decrease of the phosphotyrosine-containing proteins, presumably to maintain a balance between phosphorylation/dephosphorylation processes in the cells. Addition of 3-isobutyl-1-methyl-xanthine, an activator of phosphatases, caused a decrease or disappearance of almost all phosphotyrosine-containing proteins and, at the same time, prevented the erythroid differentiation of HD3 cells. Sodium orthovanadate, a specific inhibitor of phosphotyrosine phosphatase, increased the level of phosphotyrosine proteins and induced differentiation of HD3 cells. These results indicate that phosphorylation of cellular proteins is coupled with a reaction(s) which is responsible for triggering the differentiation of HD3 cells. The phosphorylation/dephosphorylation processes are associated with an early event(s) during the differentiation of HD3 cells and may not be connected to tyrosine residues.","['Grdisa, M']",['Grdisa M'],"['Division of Molecular Medicine, Ruder Boskovic Institute, Zagreb, Croatia. grdisa@rudjer.irb.hr']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Cell Biochem Funct,Cell biochemistry and function,8305874,"['0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Hemoglobins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Phosphoproteins)', '107-92-6 (Butyric Acid)', '1W21G5Q4N2 (Okadaic Acid)', '21820-51-9 (Phosphotyrosine)', '3WHH0066W5 (Vanadates)', '743LRP9S7N (Hemin)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 3.1.3.16 (Phosphoprotein Phosphatases)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases)', 'TBT296U68M (1-Methyl-3-isobutylxanthine)']",IM,"['1-Methyl-3-isobutylxanthine/pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Butyric Acid/pharmacology', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Chickens', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Erythroblasts/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Hemin/pharmacology', 'Hemoglobins/biosynthesis', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*pathology', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*metabolism', 'Okadaic Acid/pharmacology', 'Phosphoprotein Phosphatases/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Phosphoproteins/*metabolism', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Phosphotyrosine/analysis', 'Protein Processing, Post-Translational/drug effects', 'Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Vanadates/pharmacology']",1998/12/19 03:02,2000/06/20 09:00,['1998/12/19 03:02'],"['1998/12/19 03:02 [pubmed]', '2000/06/20 09:00 [medline]', '1998/12/19 03:02 [entrez]']","['10.1002/(SICI)1099-0844(1998120)16:4<277::AID-CBF798>3.0.CO;2-D [pii]', '10.1002/(SICI)1099-0844(1998120)16:4<277::AID-CBF798>3.0.CO;2-D [doi]']",ppublish,Cell Biochem Funct. 1998 Dec;16(4):277-82. doi: 10.1002/(SICI)1099-0844(1998120)16:4<277::AID-CBF798>3.0.CO;2-D.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The cells were pulse-treated with 2 microM CPT for 1 h; this resulted in equal numbers of replication-related DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) in both sublines. After drug removal, at different time points up to 24 h, the levels of DSBs were measured by using field inversion gel electrophoresis (FIGE) and comet assay at neutral pH. Both methods revealed faster DSBs repair in LY-S than in LY-R cells, in contrast with X-ray-induced DSBs. This however, was followed by the appearance of secondary breaks in the former subline. The cell cycle arrest was at S/G2 phase and comprised equal numbers of cells in LY-S and LY-R populations. In both sublines formation of giant cells took place, as well as delayed apoptosis starting about 20 h post-CPT incubation and proceeding with similar intensity. At the same time, the total number of necrotic cells appearing during post-exposure incubation in the LY-R subline exceeded that in the LY-S subline. We suggest that, beside previously documented higher susceptibility of topoisomerase I (Topo I) from LY-R cells to CPT, a higher initial rate of replication-related DSBs repair, but not lower propensity to apoptosis, may contribute to the relative CPT resistance of LY-S versus LY-R cells.","['Gradzka, I', 'Skierski, J', 'Szumiel, I']","['Gradzka I', 'Skierski J', 'Szumiel I']","['Institute of Nuclear Chemistry and Technology, Warsaw, Poland. iwonag@orange.ichtj.waw.pl']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Cell Biochem Funct,Cell biochemistry and function,8305874,['XT3Z54Z28A (Camptothecin)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/drug effects/*physiology', 'Camptothecin/*pharmacology', 'Cell Cycle/*drug effects', 'DNA Repair/*drug effects', 'DNA Replication', 'Electrophoresis, Agar Gel', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Hydrogen-Ion Concentration', 'Leukemia L5178/*pathology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1998/12/19 03:02,2000/06/20 09:00,['1998/12/19 03:02'],"['1998/12/19 03:02 [pubmed]', '2000/06/20 09:00 [medline]', '1998/12/19 03:02 [entrez]']","['10.1002/(SICI)1099-0844(1998120)16:4<239::AID-CBF792>3.0.CO;2-T [pii]', '10.1002/(SICI)1099-0844(1998120)16:4<239::AID-CBF792>3.0.CO;2-T [doi]']",ppublish,Cell Biochem Funct. 1998 Dec;16(4):239-52. doi: 10.1002/(SICI)1099-0844(1998120)16:4<239::AID-CBF792>3.0.CO;2-T.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

At diagnosis most patients are in early stage of the disease (stage A). It is well established that an early treatment in stage A is not associated with a survival advantage. Therefore, the disease should be treated only when signs of progression are present. The standard initial therapy is chlorambucil +/- prednisone. By this treatment remissions (mostly partial remissions) are achieved in about half of the patients. Fludarabine, a purine analogue, is more effective than chlorambucil as initial treatment (75% remissions, 27% complete remissions, 33 months progression free survival). However, the overall survival is not prolonged when compared to chlorambucil treatment. Fludarabine has a high efficacy in patients with recurrent disease, in particular in those who are resistant to alkylating agents. The allogeneic and autologous stem cell transplantation is an experimental treatment which may be indicated in younger patients who show a response to conventional treatment. With both procedures hematological remissions are frequently achieved and in some of the patients long lasting molecular remissions were obtained. Currently, it is unknown whether patients can be cured by stem cell transplantation and longer follow-up will be necessary to clarify this question. Monoclonal B-cell antibodies are effective in vivo and partial remissions can be obtained in chemotherapy refractory patients.

However, the binding of v-ErbA or any unliganded nuclear receptor to a chromatin-embedded response element as well as the role of the N-CoR-SMRT-HDAC co-repressor complex in mediating repression remain hypothetical. Here we identify a v-ErbA-response element, VRE, in an intronic DNase I hypersensitive site (HS2) of the chicken erythroid carbonic anhydrase II (CAII) gene. In vivo footprinting shows that v-ErbA is constitutively bound to this HS2-VRE in transformed, undifferentiated erythroblasts along with other transcription factors like GATA-1. Transfection assays show that the repressed HS2 region can be turned into a potent enhancer in v-ErbA-expressing cells by mutation of the VRE. Differentiation of transformed cells alleviates v-ErbA binding concomitant with activation of CAII transcription. Co-expression of a gag-TRalpha fusion protein in AEV-transformed cells and addition of ligand derepresses CAII transcription.

The 5- and 8-deaza analogues were prepared from methyl 2-L-amino-5-phthalimidopentanoate and 4-amino-4-deoxy-N10-formyl-5-deaza- and -8-deazapteroic acid, respectively. The 5,8-dideaza analogues were prepared from methyl 2-L-[(4-aminobenzoyl)amino]-5-phthalimidopentanoate and 2, 4-diaminoquinazoline-6-carbonitriles. The Ki for inhibition of human DHFR by the 5-deaza and 5-methyl-5-deaza analogues was about the same as that of 3 (0.35 pM), 11-fold lower than that of aminopterin (AMT, 1), and 15-fold lower than that of methotrexate (MTX, 2). However the Ki of the 8-deaza analogue was 27-fold lower than that of 1, and that of the 5,8-dideaza, 5-methyl-5,8-dideaza, and 5-chloro-5,8-dideaza analogues was approximately 50-fold lower. This trend was consistent with the published literature on the corresponding DHFR inhibitors with a glutamate side chain. In colony formation assays against the human head and neck squamous carcinoma cell line SCC25 after 72 h of treatment, the 5- and 8-deaza analogues were approximately as potent as 3, whereas the 5,8-dideaza analogue was 3 times more potent. 5-Methyl and 5-chloro substitution was also favorable, with the 5-methyl-5-deaza analogue being 2. 5-fold more potent than the 5-deaza analogue. However the effect of 5-methyl substitution was less pronounced in the 5,8-dideaza analogues than in the 5-deaza analogues. The 5-chloro-5,8-dideaza analogue of 3 was the most active member of the series, with an IC50 = 0.33 nM versus 1.8 nM for 3 and 15 nM for MTX. The 5-methyl-5-deaza analogue of 3 was also tested at the National Cancer Institute against a panel of 50 human tumor cell lines in culture and was consistently more potent than 3, with IC50 values in the low-nanomolar to subnanomolar range against most of the tumors. Leukemia and colorectal carcinoma cell lines were generally most sensitive, though good activity was also observed against CNS tumors and carcinomas of the breast and prostate. The results of this study demonstrate that B-ring analogues of 3 inhibit DHFR activity and tumor cell colony formation as well as, or better than, the parent compound. In view of the fact that 3 and its B-ring analogues cannot form polyglutamates, their high cytotoxicity relative to the corresponding B-ring analogues of AMT is noteworthy.","['Rosowsky, A', 'Wright, J E', 'Vaidya, C M', 'Bader, H', 'Forsch, R A', 'Mota, C E', 'Pardo, J', 'Chen, C S', 'Chen, Y N']","['Rosowsky A', 'Wright JE', 'Vaidya CM', 'Bader H', 'Forsch RA', 'Mota CE', 'Pardo J', 'Chen CS', 'Chen YN']","['Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and Department of Biological Chemistry and Molecular Pharmacology, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts 02115, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Med Chem,Journal of medicinal chemistry,9716531,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Folic Acid Antagonists)', '0 (Pterins)', '113857-87-7', '(N(alpha)-(4-amino-4-deoxypteroyl)-N(delta)-hemiphthaloyl-L-ornithine)', 'E524N2IXA3 (Ornithine)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*chemical synthesis/chemistry/pharmacology', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Folic Acid Antagonists/*chemical synthesis/chemistry/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Inhibitory Concentration 50', 'Ornithine/*analogs & derivatives/chemical synthesis/chemistry/pharmacology', 'Pterins/*chemical synthesis/chemistry/pharmacology', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1998/12/19 00:00,1998/12/19 00:01,['1998/12/19 00:00'],"['1998/12/19 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/12/19 00:01 [medline]', '1998/12/19 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1021/jm980477+ [doi]', 'jm980477+ [pii]']",ppublish,J Med Chem. 1998 Dec 17;41(26):5310-9. doi: 10.1021/jm980477+.,"['CA25394/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA70349/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A series of 2-alkyl- and 2-aryl-substituted 8-hydroxy-, 8-methoxy-, and 8-methylquinazolin-4(3H)-ones has been synthesized and evaluated for PARP inhibitory activity in permeabilized L1210 murine leukemia cells. 8-Methoxy- and 8-methylquinazolinones (14-34) were readily prepared by acylation of 3-substituted anthranilamides with the appropriate acid chloride, followed by base-catalyzed cyclization. The requisite 8-hydroxyquinazolinones (6, 35-39) were synthesized by demethylation of the corresponding 8-methoxyquinazolinones with BBr3. N-Methylation of 8-methoxy-2-methylquinazolinone (15) with MeI, followed by O-demethylation by BBr3, afforded the control N3-methylquinazolinones 42 and 43, respectively. In general, an 8-hydroxy or 8-methyl substituent enhanced inhibitory activity in comparison with an 8-methoxy group. 2-Phenylquinazolinones were marginally less potent than the corresponding 2-methylquinazolinones, but the introduction of an electron-withdrawing or electron-donating 4'-substituent on the 2-aryl ring invariably increased potency. This was particularly evident in the 8-methylquinazolinone series (IC50 values 0.13-0.27 microM), which are among the most potent PARP inhibitors reported to date. N3-Methylquinazolinones 42 and 43 were essentially devoid of activity (IC50 values > 100 microM). In studies with L1210 cells in vitro, a concentration of 200 microM 8-hydroxy-2-methylquinazolinone (6, NU1025) (IC50 value 0.40 microM) potentiated the cytotoxicity of the monomethylating agent 5-(3-methyltriazen-1-yl)imidazole-4-carboxamide and gamma-radiation 3.5- and 1.4-fold, respectively, at the 10% survival level.","['Griffin, R J', 'Srinivasan, S', 'Bowman, K', 'Calvert, A H', 'Curtin, N J', 'Newell, D R', 'Pemberton, L C', 'Golding, B T']","['Griffin RJ', 'Srinivasan S', 'Bowman K', 'Calvert AH', 'Curtin NJ', 'Newell DR', 'Pemberton LC', 'Golding BT']","['Department of Chemistry, Bedson Building, The University, Newcastle upon Tyne NE1 7RU, U.K.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Med Chem,Journal of medicinal chemistry,9716531,"['0 (Alkylating Agents)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (NU 1025)', '0 (Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerase Inhibitors)', '0 (Quinazolines)', '7GR28W0FJI (Dacarbazine)', 'PYY6H17XIV (5-(3-methyl-1-triazeno)imidazole-4-carboxamide)']",IM,"['Alkylating Agents/pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*chemical synthesis/chemistry/pharmacology', 'Cell Survival/drug effects/radiation effects', '*DNA Repair', 'Dacarbazine/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Drug Synergism', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*chemical synthesis/chemistry/pharmacology', 'Gamma Rays', 'Leukemia L1210/pathology', 'Mice', '*Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerase Inhibitors', 'Quinazolines/*chemical synthesis/chemistry/pharmacology', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1998/12/19 00:00,1998/12/19 00:01,['1998/12/19 00:00'],"['1998/12/19 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/12/19 00:01 [medline]', '1998/12/19 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1021/jm980273t [doi]', 'jm980273t [pii]']",ppublish,J Med Chem. 1998 Dec 17;41(26):5247-56. doi: 10.1021/jm980273t.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Reasons for this divergent clinical behavior of childhood- versus adult-onset disease are unknown. Recently, two activating mutations in the intracellular domain of the proto-oncogene c-kit, which encodes a tyrosine kinase receptor for the mast cell growth factor stem cell factor, have been detected in the human leukemic mast cell line HMC-1. We have therefore studied lesional skin biopsies from patients with adult- and childhood-onset indolent mastocytosis for the presence of these codon 560 and 816 mutations. C-kit coding DNA sequences were amplified and analyzed by mutation-specific restriction analyses, and mutated polymerase chain reaction products were additionally cloned and sequenced. The codon 816 mutation was found in all six samples from adult patients, but not in any of the 11 specimens from children. In addition, the codon 560 mutation could be demonstrated for the first time in indolent mastocytosis, namely in two of four specimens from adult patients, but not in those from two children. These data thus provide a possible explanation for the divergent clinical behavior of adult- versus childhood-onset indolent mastocytosis, with the first being associated with an activating mutation, possibly as part of a neoplastic process, and the latter representing most likely a reactive process of an as yet unknown pathogenesis.","['Buttner, C', 'Henz, B M', 'Welker, P', 'Sepp, N T', 'Grabbe, J']","['Buttner C', 'Henz BM', 'Welker P', 'Sepp NT', 'Grabbe J']","['Department of Dermatology, Charite, Humboldt University, Berlin, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Invest Dermatol,The Journal of investigative dermatology,0426720,"['0 (Coloring Agents)', '0 (MAS1 protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Mas)', '15XUH0X66N (Tolonium Chloride)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit)']",IM,"['Adult', '*Age of Onset', 'Biopsy', 'Cell Count', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Coloring Agents', 'Female', 'Genes', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Mast Cells/cytology', 'Mastocytosis/*epidemiology/*genetics', 'Middle Aged', 'Proto-Oncogene Mas', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit/*genetics', 'Skin/pathology', 'Tolonium Chloride', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1998/12/18 00:00,1998/12/18 00:01,['1998/12/18 00:00'],"['1998/12/18 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/12/18 00:01 [medline]', '1998/12/18 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1046/j.1523-1747.1998.00414.x [doi]', 'S0022-202X(15)40348-3 [pii]']",ppublish,J Invest Dermatol. 1998 Dec;111(6):1227-31. doi: 10.1046/j.1523-1747.1998.00414.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study describes the development of T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) in a child occurring 6 years after renal transplantation. PATIENT: An 11-year-old boy had received a renal allograft from his father at 5 years of age. He was receiving imuran, prednisone, and cyclosporin A prophylaxis for graft rejection after transplant until T-cell ALL was diagnosed. Although an acute Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection was noted at the time of diagnosis, the EBV genome was not detected by Southern blot analysis and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in the leukemic cells. RESULTS: A large mediastinal mass and malignant pleural effusion were noted at diagnosis. Leukemic cells of his bone marrow and pleural fluid expressed T-cell antigens with unique cytogenetic features, including add(1)(p36.1), del(11)(q14), and monosomy 7. EBV serology was consistent with a recent infection but EBV genome was not detected by Southern blot and PCR analysis in his leukemic cells. Human T-lymphotropic virus-I (HTLV-I) antibody titer was negative. He has been on chemotherapy for 9 months, maintaining his first remission. CONCLUSIONS: Malignancies developing after renal transplantations are usually lymphoproliferative disorders and of B-cell origin. In the majority of these patients, EBV plays an etiologic role. Although adult T-cell leukemia developing during immunosuppressive treatment in renal transplant recipients has been reported, T-cell leukemia after transplant in pediatric patients has not been reported to date. This case is unique in terms of the patient's age, the T-cell immunophenotype, the cytogenetic features, and the absence of an EBV genome within the leukemic cells despite an acute EBV infection before diagnosis.","['Levendoglu-Tugal, O', 'Weiss, R', 'Ozkaynak, M F', 'Sandoval, C', 'Lentzner, B', 'Jayabose, S']","['Levendoglu-Tugal O', 'Weiss R', 'Ozkaynak MF', 'Sandoval C', 'Lentzner B', 'Jayabose S']","['Clinical Pediatrics, Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, New York Medical College, Valhalla 10595, USA.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",United States,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol,Journal of pediatric hematology/oncology,9505928,"['0 (DNA, Viral)']",IM,"['Child', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'DNA, Viral/analysis', 'Herpesvirus 4, Human/genetics', 'Humans', 'Immunosuppression Therapy/adverse effects', 'Kidney Transplantation/*adverse effects', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*etiology/genetics/virology', 'Male', 'Mediastinal Neoplasms/*etiology']",1998/12/18 00:00,1998/12/18 00:01,['1998/12/18 00:00'],"['1998/12/18 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/12/18 00:01 [medline]', '1998/12/18 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol. 1998 Nov-Dec;20(6):548-51.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: The patient was a 15-year-old African-American girl with APL that had resisted conventional chemotherapy, ATRA therapy followed by autologous peripheral stem cell transplant, and a second course of ATRA induction therapy administered for relapse after transplant. The patient was treated with 10 mg As2O3 intravenously for 28 days. After a 4-week break, she received a second 28-day course of As2O3 therapy. RESULTS: After completion of the first 28-day course of As2O3 treatment, morphologic and cytogenetic remission occurred. Reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction demonstrated persistence of the PML-RARalpha fusion transcript. After the second course of As2O3, the patient had a complete remission by morphologic, cytogenetic, and molecular criteria. Approximately 6 months after the end of two courses of As2O3 therapy, the patient again underwent relapse. An additional course of As2O3 achieved a morphologic, although not a cytogenetic or molecular, remission. CONCLUSIONS: As2O3 therapy produced remission in a patient with multiply relapsed, ATRA-resistant APL. Toxic side effects were minimal. The patient underwent relapse 6 months after this therapy.

In those cultures the stimulatory effects (33%) outnumbered the inhibitory ones (6%). The stimulatory effects occurred mainly in the bone marrow samples of the patients with highly malignant NHL. The observations are compatible with the idea that the membrane endopeptidase (CALLA, CD10) participates in processes controlling the proliferation and differentiation of hematopoetic cells by cleaving the neuropeptides and related hemoregulatory peptides.","['Stanovic, S', 'Boranic, M', 'Petrovecki, M', 'Nemet, D', 'Skodlar, J', 'Golubic-Cepulic, B', 'Batinic, D', 'Labar, B']","['Stanovic S', 'Boranic M', 'Petrovecki M', 'Nemet D', 'Skodlar J', 'Golubic-Cepulic B', 'Batinic D', 'Labar B']","['Ruder Boskovic Institute, Department of Molecular Medicine, Zagreb, Croatia.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],France,Biomed Pharmacother,Biomedicine & pharmacotherapy = Biomedecine & pharmacotherapie,8213295,"['0 (Protease Inhibitors)', 'B79L7B5X3Z (Thiorphan)', 'EC 3.4.24.11 (Neprilysin)']",IM,"['Bone Marrow/*drug effects/enzymology/pathology', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'Granulocytes/*drug effects/pathology', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/enzymology/*pathology', 'Macrophages/*drug effects/pathology', 'Neprilysin/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Protease Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Thiorphan/*pharmacology']",1998/12/18 00:00,1998/12/18 00:01,['1998/12/18 00:00'],"['1998/12/18 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/12/18 00:01 [medline]', '1998/12/18 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0753-3322(99)80008-0 [pii]', '10.1016/S0753-3322(99)80008-0 [doi]']",ppublish,Biomed Pharmacother. 1998;52(9):397-402. doi: 10.1016/S0753-3322(99)80008-0.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, data of acute cardiovascular effects of idarubicin are scanty but may have clinical significance in predicting late cardiovascular complications. In the present study we evaluated prospectively acute neurohumoral and cardiovascular effects of idarubicin containing induction chemotherapy in 10 patients with newly diagnosed AML or MDS. Idarubicin was administered intravenously 12 mg/m2 on d 1, 3 and 5 as a part of the induction chemotherapy. Serial measurements of plasma atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) and brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) were performed at baseline and the day following each idarubicin infusion. Echocardiography was performed to assess cardiac systolic and diastolic function. Signal averaged electrocardiography (ECG) was recorded to observe myocardial late potentials associated with possible myocardial injury. In addition, ambulatory ECG recording was performed to assess arrhythmias. Plasma concentrations of ANP increased from 18.2 +/- 1.5 pmol/l to 27.8 +/- 3.5 pmol/l (p = 0.011), to 30.2 +/- 3.0 pmol/l (p = 0.002) and to 40.8 +/- 6.0 pmol/l (p = 0.006) after the first, second and third doses of idarubicin, respectively. Similarly, plasma concentration of BNP increased from 6.2 +/- 1.9 to 9.0 +/- 1.8 pmol/l (p = 0.049) and 17.5 +/- 8.1 pmol/l (p = 0.203) after the first and third idarubicin infusion. Concomitantly, there was a trend towards an increase in left ventricular end diastolic diameter (LVEDD) (50.2 +/- 1.8 to 54.4 +/- 2.2 mm, p = 0.070). The increase in plasma BNP concentrations correlated significantly with the increase in LVEDD (r = 0.624; p = 0.002). No significant ECG changes or arrhythmias were associated with idarubicin infusions except in 1 patient who developed abnormal myocardial late potentials. Our results show that idarubicin causes acute neurohumoral activation associated with increased LVEDD indicating subclinical myocardial dysfunction. Whether these acute changes predict late clinical cardiomyopathy should be evaluated in prospective studies with larger number of patients and with higher cumulative anthracycline doses.","['Nousiainen, T', 'Jantunen, E', 'Vanninen, E', 'Remes, J', 'Puustinen, J', 'Rantala, A', 'Vuolteenaho, O', 'Hartikainen, J']","['Nousiainen T', 'Jantunen E', 'Vanninen E', 'Remes J', 'Puustinen J', 'Rantala A', 'Vuolteenaho O', 'Hartikainen J']","['Department of Medicine, Kuopio University Hospital and University of Kuopio, Finland. tapio.nousiainen@kuh.fi']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Eur J Haematol,European journal of haematology,8703985,"['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '114471-18-0 (Natriuretic Peptide, Brain)', '85637-73-6 (Atrial Natriuretic Factor)', 'ZRP63D75JW (Idarubicin)']",IM,"['Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/*administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Atrial Natriuretic Factor/blood', 'Electrocardiography', 'Heart/*physiopathology', 'Humans', 'Idarubicin/*administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Injections, Intravenous', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/blood/*drug therapy/physiopathology', 'Natriuretic Peptide, Brain', 'Neurosecretory Systems/*physiopathology']",1998/12/17 00:00,1998/12/17 00:01,['1998/12/17 00:00'],"['1998/12/17 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/12/17 00:01 [medline]', '1998/12/17 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1600-0609.1998.tb01099.x [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Haematol. 1998 Nov;61(5):347-53. doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0609.1998.tb01099.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

CD14/CD66 co-expression > or = 5% were found in 131/691 bone marrow samples. Only 55 of these exhibited an identifiable population in 2-parameter flow cytometry histograms. Of the 55 samples 43 (78%) came from patients with myeloid disorders; e.g. 11 with myelodysplastic syndromes, 15 with chronic myeloproliferative disorders and 17 with acute myeloid leukaemia. Only one of these 17 cases was a de novo case, while 8 were secondary to another malignant haematological disease and 8 were from the period after cytoreductive therapy. Notably, CD14/CD66 co-expression patterns were related to disease categories; e.g. in chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia and acute myeloid leukaemia following a dysplastic phase the co-expression displayed two subsets in peripheral blood, low-avidity CD14 and low-avidity CD66, respectively. The latter disease category also exhibited these 2 subsets in bone marrow. In all other cases, the CD14/CD66 co-expression in bone marrow was heterogeneous. In conclusion, abnormal CD14/CD66 co-expression might be a valuable parameter in defining asynchronous myelopoiesis in malignant myeloid disorders, especially myeloproliferative disorders and secondary acute myeloid leukemias.","['Hansen, I', 'Meyer, K', 'Hokland, P']","['Hansen I', 'Meyer K', 'Hokland P']","['Department of Medicine and Haematology, Aarhus University Hospital, Aarhus C, Denmark.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Eur J Haematol,European journal of haematology,8703985,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (CD66 antigens)', '0 (Cell Adhesion Molecules)', '0 (Lipopolysaccharide Receptors)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD/*analysis', 'Antigens, Differentiation/*analysis', '*Biomarkers, Tumor', 'Bone Marrow/*immunology/pathology', 'Cell Adhesion Molecules', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*immunology/pathology', 'Humans', 'Lipopolysaccharide Receptors/*analysis']",1998/12/17 00:00,1998/12/17 00:01,['1998/12/17 00:00'],"['1998/12/17 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/12/17 00:01 [medline]', '1998/12/17 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1600-0609.1998.tb01098.x [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Haematol. 1998 Nov;61(5):339-46. doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0609.1998.tb01098.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Data on epidemiology and occupational risk factors for APL desumed from the GIMEMA archive are reported and compared with those of the other AML. An exploratory case-case study was designed on AML patients from 56 haematology centres in Italy. Overall, 4296 patients older than 15 yr with a new diagnosis of acute leukaemia were recorded between July 1992 and July 1997. Of these, 335 were classified as APL, and 2894 as other AML. The median age of APL patients was 43 compared to 59 yr for the other AML (p < 0.00001). In order to identify peculiar risk factors for APL development, different parameters were compared in the 2 groups. After adjusting by age no significant differences were observed with regard to education, lifetime prevalence of cancer among siblings and previous diseases in the patient's history. Occupational exposure as a possible risk factor for APL showed no increased risk compared to other AML among farmers, builders and leather workers. A significant association was found in electricians (OR=4.4, 95% CI=2.0-9.7) and a weak association was found in wood workers (OR=3.2, 95% CI=0.8-10.8). The proportion of APL with respect to other AML was significantly higher in the north east of Italy compared to the rest of the country (OR=1.7, 95% CI=1.3-2.2). These data confirm the younger age of APL patients compared to the other AML. A possible role of electromagnetic fields is suggested by the higher risk of APL in electrical workers and in the more industrialized areas of the country.","['Pulsoni, A', 'Stazi, A', 'Cotichini, R', 'Allione, B', 'Cerri, R', 'Di Bona, E', 'Nosari, A M', 'Pagano, L', 'Recchia, A', 'Ribersani, M', 'Rocchi, L', 'Veneri, D', 'Visani, G', 'Mandelli, F', 'Mele, A']","['Pulsoni A', 'Stazi A', 'Cotichini R', 'Allione B', 'Cerri R', 'Di Bona E', 'Nosari AM', 'Pagano L', 'Recchia A', 'Ribersani M', 'Rocchi L', 'Veneri D', 'Visani G', 'Mandelli F', 'Mele A']","['Department of Cellular Biotechnology and Haematology, University La Sapienza Roma, Italy. pulsoni@bce.med.uniroma1.it']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Eur J Haematol,European journal of haematology,8703985,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Italy/epidemiology', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*epidemiology/etiology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Risk Factors']",1998/12/17 00:00,1998/12/17 00:01,['1998/12/17 00:00'],"['1998/12/17 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/12/17 00:01 [medline]', '1998/12/17 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1600-0609.1998.tb01096.x [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Haematol. 1998 Nov;61(5):327-32. doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0609.1998.tb01096.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The detection of these aberrations in lymphocytes of individuals exposed to potential leukemogens may serve as useful biomarkers of increased leukemia risk. We have used a novel fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) procedure to determine if specific aberrations in chromosomes 1, 5 and 7 occur at an elevated rate in the blood cells of workers exposed to benzene. Forty-three healthy workers exposed to a wide range of benzene concentrations (median 31 p.p.m., 8 h time-weighted average) and 44 unexposed controls from Shanghai were studied. Whole blood was cultured and metaphase spreads were harvested at 72 h. Benzene exposure was associated with increases in the rates of monosomy 5 and 7 but not monosomy 1 (P < 0.001, P < 0.0001 and P = 0.94, respectively) and with increases in trisomy and tetrasomy frequencies of all three chromosomes.

After 1 day of culture, PGCs cultured on STO#8 cells showed significantly higher survival than PGCs cultured on STO cells (p < 0.05). The combined effect of SCF and LIF caused a significant increase in PGC number by day 3 of culture when PGCs were cultured on either STO cells (p < 0.01) or STO#8 (p < 0.001). When SCF and LIF were used together with bFGF no increase in the PGC number was observed.

In particular, the translation of the diagnostic criteria of the French-American-British (FAB) cooperative group as primarily defined by bone marrow cytology into histology poses considerable problems. In this study, we investigated the expression of lactoferrin (LF) in various subtypes of AML and studied the usefulness of its immunohistochemical detection combined with a panel of antibodies directed against myeloperoxidase (MPOX), lysozyme (LYS), CD34 and naphthol-AS-D-chloroacetate esterase (NACE) staining in solving this problem. Trephine biopsies of 52 cases of AML were selected for histological evaluation in comparison to bone marrow aspirates classified according to FAB (M1 n = 10, M2 n = 7, M3 n = 11, M4 n = 13 and M5 n = 11). The results obtained confirmed the specificity of LF as a marker for secondary granules in neutrophilic myeloid cells and as a tool to subclassify AML. Its parallel application with (immuno-)staining for MPOX, LYS and NACE has allowed the identification of M1, M3, M5 cases, where there LF is lacking. Typically M2 is characterized by a subpopulation of LF-positive cells which tend to display a myelocytic differentiation. However, M4 shows a heterogeneous expression pattern of LF: M4a may be defined as more immature variant without LF expression while in M4b a more mature myeloid subpopulation stains positive for LF.","['Al Safadi, L', 'Kohler, G', 'Schaefer, H E']","['Al Safadi L', 'Kohler G', 'Schaefer HE']","['Department of Pathology, Albert-Ludwigs-University, Freiburg, Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Greece,Anticancer Res,Anticancer research,8102988,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Oxadiazoles)', '60589-06-2 (3-(2-methoxyphenyl)-5-methoxy-1,3,4-oxadiazol-2(3H)-one)', 'EC 3.1.1.- (Carboxylic Ester Hydrolases)', 'EC 3.1.1.- (chloroacetate esterase)', 'EC 3.2.1.17 (Muramidase)', 'EC 3.4.21.- (Lactoferrin)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antigens, CD34/metabolism', 'Biopsy', 'Carboxylic Ester Hydrolases/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Lactoferrin/*analysis', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*classification/pathology', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Acute/*classification/pathology', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*classification/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Muramidase/metabolism', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*analysis', 'Oxadiazoles/pharmacology', 'Reference Values']",1998/12/17 00:00,1998/12/17 00:01,['1998/12/17 00:00'],"['1998/12/17 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/12/17 00:01 [medline]', '1998/12/17 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Anticancer Res. 1998 Sep-Oct;18(5B):3677-84.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As previously reported, many antitumor immune responses are IL-2 dependent: clinical observations indicate that a worse survival in advanced tumor patients is related with a decrease of soluble IL-2 levels. A soluble form of CD8 has been described: as found in Hodgkin's disease and acute lymphoblastic leukemia, sCD8 levels have a prognostic value. To explain the significance of these soluble molecules in solid tumors, we a) determinated sIL-2R and sCD8 in 84 patients; b) correlated the expression of p55 chain of IL-2R and CD8 antigen on the cell-surface of peripheral lymphocytes to sIL-2R and sCD8 levels; c) analyzed endogenous IL-2R levels in patients with lung cancer. An increase of sIL-2R was found in 82% of cases, while high levels of sCD8 were observed in 32%; no correlation was observed between sIL-2R and the expression of p55 on the surface of peripheral lymphocytes: IL-2 levels in patients with NSCLC were significatively reduced, when compared to healthy controls, with an inverse relationship between endogenous IL-2 concentration and sIL-2R levels. Whatever may be the physiopathological mechanism of the increase of sIL-2 observed in solid tumors, this rise may contribute to the immunodepression correlated to neoplastic disease. Therefore, higher levels of sIL-2R/IL-2 ratio has a negative biologic prognostic significance. We think that determinating CD8 antigen in the serum can offer a more sensitive and specific measurement of activation of suppressor/cytotoxic T-lymphocytes.","['Orditura, M', 'De Vita, F', 'Roscigno, A', 'Auriemma, A', 'Infusino, S', 'Catalano, G']","['Orditura M', 'De Vita F', 'Roscigno A', 'Auriemma A', 'Infusino S', 'Catalano G']","['Division of Medical Oncology, Department of Internal and Experimental Medicine, II University School of Medicine of Naples, Naples, Italy.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Greece,Int J Mol Med,International journal of molecular medicine,9810955,"['0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Antigens, Surface)', '0 (CD8 Antigens)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-2)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/*blood', 'Antigens, Surface/blood', 'CD8 Antigens/*blood', 'Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung/*blood/metabolism', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Lung Neoplasms/*blood/metabolism', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Receptors, Interleukin-2/*blood', 'Solubility']",1998/12/17 00:00,1998/12/17 00:01,['1998/12/17 00:00'],"['1998/12/17 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/12/17 00:01 [medline]', '1998/12/17 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.3892/ijmm.2.1.75 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Mol Med. 1998 Jul;2(1):75-9. doi: 10.3892/ijmm.2.1.75.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although both enzyme activities increased slightly, there were no significant changes in spermidine/spermine N1-acetyltransferase activity or polyamine oxidase activity. After longer exposures (48-72 h), significant induction of spermidine/spermine N1-acetyltransferase activity and loss of polyamine content occurred.

These processes are controlled in large part by cell-restricted transcription factors which cooperate with more widely expressed factors to direct lineage-specific gene expression. Candidate hematopoietic transcriptional regulators have been identified by characterizing factors mediating cell-specific gene transcription and by defining genes involved in chromosomal rearrangements in leukemia. The application of transgenic and embryonic stem cell methods have provided insights into their in vivo functions and suggested mechanisms by which lineage selection may be achieved. One of the first, and best, characterized hematopoietic transcription factors is GATA-1.

Pit1 and Pit2 were expressed in different amounts in human tissues and cell lines; Pit1-specific mRNA was generally more abundant than Pit2 mRNA. No correlation was found between Pit1 and Pit2 RNA levels and infectibility by GaLV and A-MuLV pseudotyped vectors, respectively. GaLV and A-MuLV revealed a partial reciprocal interference. MuLV-10A1 can utilize both Pit1 and Pit2 for entry into cells but could not infect any of the 14 human cell lines more efficiently than A-MuLV or GaLV. Interference assays suggested that MuLV-10A1 has a higher affinity for and infected most cells predominantly by Pit2. However, at least in one cell line it used Pit1 more efficiently for entry. We conclude that (1) Pit1 and Pit2 mRNA levels in human cells are not indicative of the infectibility by GaLV and A-MuLV pseudotypes, respectively; (2) A-MuLV can infect target cells as efficiently as can GaLV, although Pit2 RNA is less abundant than Pit1 RNA; (3) factor(s) in addition to the presence of Pit1 and Pit2 are involved in retroviral infection; and (4) MuLV-10A1 pseudotype does not infect human cells more efficiently than do A-MuLV and GaLV pseudotypes.","['Uckert, W', 'Willimsky, G', 'Pedersen, F S', 'Blankenstein, T', 'Pedersen, L']","['Uckert W', 'Willimsky G', 'Pedersen FS', 'Blankenstein T', 'Pedersen L']","['Max-Delbruck-Center for Molecular Medicine, Berlin, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Hum Gene Ther,Human gene therapy,9008950,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (RNA, Viral)', '0 (Receptors, Virus)', '0 (leukemia virus receptor, gibbon ape)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'DNA Primers', '*Genetic Vectors', 'Humans', 'RNA, Viral/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Virus/*genetics', 'Retroviridae/*genetics/pathogenicity']",1998/12/16 00:00,1998/12/16 00:01,['1998/12/16 00:00'],"['1998/12/16 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/12/16 00:01 [medline]', '1998/12/16 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1089/hum.1998.9.17-2619 [doi]'],ppublish,Hum Gene Ther. 1998 Nov 20;9(17):2619-27. doi: 10.1089/hum.1998.9.17-2619.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Targeting retroviral vectors to specific tissues would increase their safety and clinical applicability. To explore the potential of targeting vector expression to skeletal muscle, the murine leukemia virus broad transcriptional tropism was modified by substituting the viral promoter and/or enhancer with a transcriptional cassette containing the human T cell leukemia virus type I Tax-responsive element and the minimal muscle creatine kinase enhancer and promoter. The resulting retroviral vectors could be transcriptionally trans-activated by tax. In the absence of Tax, however, the viruses showed muscle-specific expression. Trans-complementing packaging and indicator cells stably expressing Tax were used to isolate high-titer producer cell clones (10(6) CFU/ml). In vitro, the levels of expression of these RVs in Tax-expressing fibroblasts were 10,000-fold higher than in normal fibroblasts and 1000-fold higher in C2C12 myotubes than in C2C12 myoblasts. Expression of the vectors and the endogenous muscle creatine kinase gene was similarly dependent on the maturity of the muscle cultures. One vector with modified LTRs was also tested in vivo in regenerating muscle and showed a delayed pattern of expression in myofibers compared with the vector containing the wild-type LTRs. These vectors can be easily modified to contain different tissue-specific enhancer and promoter elements and the availability of complementing packaging and indicator cells expressing Tax should allow their application in a variety of gene therapy settings.","['Fassati, A', 'Bardoni, A', 'Sironi, M', 'Wells, D J', 'Bresolin, N', 'Scarlato, G', 'Hatanaka, M', 'Yamaoka, S', 'Dickson, G']","['Fassati A', 'Bardoni A', 'Sironi M', 'Wells DJ', 'Bresolin N', 'Scarlato G', 'Hatanaka M', 'Yamaoka S', 'Dickson G']","['Department of Biochemistry, Royal Holloway College, University of London, Egham, Surrey, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Hum Gene Ther,Human gene therapy,9008950,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (Gene Products, tax)', 'EC 1.13.12.- (Luciferases)', 'EC 2.7.1.95 (Kanamycin Kinase)']",IM,"['3T3 Cells', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Line', 'DNA Primers', '*Enhancer Elements, Genetic', 'Gene Products, tax/genetics', 'Genes, Reporter', 'Genetic Complementation Test', '*Genetic Vectors', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/genetics', 'Kanamycin Kinase/genetics', 'Lac Operon', 'Luciferases/genetics', 'Mice', 'Mice, Nude', 'Plasmids', '*Repetitive Sequences, Nucleic Acid', 'Retroviridae/*genetics']",1998/12/16 00:00,1998/12/16 00:01,['1998/12/16 00:00'],"['1998/12/16 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/12/16 00:01 [medline]', '1998/12/16 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1089/hum.1998.9.17-2459 [doi]'],ppublish,Hum Gene Ther. 1998 Nov 20;9(17):2459-68. doi: 10.1089/hum.1998.9.17-2459.,['Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The functional receptor for LIF is composed of LIFR alpha-chain (LIFRalpha) and gp130 both of which are shared in the functional receptors for oncostatin M, ciliary neurotrophic factor, and cardiotrophin-1. By using stable transfection of wild-type or cytoplasmic deletion mutants of LIFRalpha together with full-length gp130 into Ba/F3 cells, we found that cells expressing gp130 and an extensively deleted mutant LIFRalpha containing only the box-1 region were capable of proliferating in response to LIF, although LIF-dependent long term growth of these cells was seriously impaired. Using a similar strategy to generate WEHI-3BD+ cells expressing gp130 and wild-type or truncation mutants of LIFRalpha, studies revealed that the box-1 region of the LIFRalpha was also sufficient for LIF-dependent induction of different aspects of differentiation, including up-regulation of macrophage surface marker expression, morphological change, and cell migration in agar culture. However, the C-terminal region of the LIFRalpha, although not essential for intracellular signaling, was important for efficient receptor-mediated ligand internalization. In summary, the membrane-proximal box-1 region plays a dominant role in LIF-induced signal transduction of both proliferation and differentiation.","['Zhang, Y', 'Willson, T', 'Metcalf, D', 'Cary, D', 'Hilton, D J', 'Clark, R', 'Nicola, N A']","['Zhang Y', 'Willson T', 'Metcalf D', 'Cary D', 'Hilton DJ', 'Clark R', 'Nicola NA']","['Walter and Eliza Hall Institute for Medical Research and the Cooperative Research Centre for Cellular Growth Factors, Royal Melbourne Hospital, Victoria 3050, Australia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-3)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (LIFR protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor Receptor alpha Subunit)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Macromolecular Substances)', '0 (Receptors, Cytokine)', '0 (Receptors, OSM-LIF)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', 'VC2W18DGKR (Thymidine)']",IM,"['Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/pharmacology', 'Growth Inhibitors/*pharmacology/physiology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*cytology/drug effects/physiology', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-3/pharmacology', '*Interleukin-6', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor Receptor alpha Subunit', 'Lymphokines/*pharmacology/physiology', 'Macromolecular Substances', 'Receptors, Cytokine/chemistry/*physiology', 'Receptors, OSM-LIF', 'Recombinant Proteins/chemistry/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Sequence Deletion', 'Thymidine/metabolism', 'Transfection']",1998/12/16 00:00,1998/12/16 00:01,['1998/12/16 00:00'],"['1998/12/16 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/12/16 00:01 [medline]', '1998/12/16 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1074/jbc.273.51.34370 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(19)88463-6 [pii]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1998 Dec 18;273(51):34370-83. doi: 10.1074/jbc.273.51.34370.,['CA22556/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recently, a family of autophosphorylating kinases termed CLK (CDC2/CDC28-like kinases) was shown to phosphorylate SR proteins and to influence alternative splicing in overexpression systems. Here we used endogenous CLK2 protein to demonstrate that it displays different biochemical characteristics compared with its overexpressed protein and that it is differentially phosphorylated in vivo. Furthermore, CLK2 changed its nuclear localization upon treatment with the kinase inhibitor 5, 6-dichloro-1-beta-D-ribofuranosylbenzimidazole. We have also identified a CLK2 autophosphorylation site, which is highly conserved among all CLK proteins, and we show by site-directed mutagenesis that its phosphorylation influences the subnuclear localization of CLK2.

We used electron probe microanalysis (EPMA) to investigate the subcellular distribution of Mg in HL60 cells (a promyelocytic leukemia cell line) before and after retinoic acid (RA)-induced differentiation. Most intracellular Mg is bound to ATP and the Mg-ATP complex regulates several metabolic enzymes. We also compared alterations in Mg content following differentiation with the changes in ATP and ADP levels. Using atomic absorption spectrophotometry, we observed a significant decrease (-20%) in cellular Mg content in RA-differentiated HL60 cells. To investigate which intracellular compartments were involved in these changes, we analyzed subcellular elemental composition in freeze-dried cryosections of rapidly frozen undifferentiated and differentiated HL60 cells by EPMA. Following differentiation of HL60 cells, we observed an 18% decrease in Mg content in both the cytoplasm (regions of the cell excluding mitochondria and nuclei) and mitochondria. There was also a significant (40%) decrease in cytoplasmic Ca content after RA-induced differentiation. Nuclear Mg concentration was not significantly different between differentiated and undifferentiated HL60 cells, although differentiation was accompanied by a 30% decrease in the nuclear K/Na ratio. After differentiation, cellular ATP and ADP content decreased by 31 and 40%, respectively. We conclude that during exit from the cell cycle, Mg redistributes within cells and that the decrease in cytoplasmic and mitochondrial Mg is accompanied by a decrease in ATP and ADP content.","['Di Francesco, A', 'Desnoyer, R W', 'Covacci, V', 'Wolf, F I', 'Romani, A', 'Cittadini, A', 'Bond, M']","['Di Francesco A', 'Desnoyer RW', 'Covacci V', 'Wolf FI', 'Romani A', 'Cittadini A', 'Bond M']","[""Department of Anesthesia, Brigham and Womens' Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Arch Biochem Biophys,Archives of biochemistry and biophysics,0372430,"['0 (Chlorides)', '27YLU75U4W (Phosphorus)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', '61D2G4IYVH (Adenosine Diphosphate)', '70FD1KFU70 (Sulfur)', '8L70Q75FXE (Adenosine Triphosphate)', '9NEZ333N27 (Sodium)', 'I38ZP9992A (Magnesium)', 'RWP5GA015D (Potassium)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Adenosine Diphosphate/metabolism', 'Adenosine Triphosphate/metabolism', 'Calcium/metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation/*drug effects', 'Cell Nucleus/metabolism/ultrastructure', 'Chlorides/metabolism', 'Cytoplasm/metabolism/ultrastructure', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Magnesium/*metabolism', 'Microscopy, Electron', 'Mitochondria/metabolism/ultrastructure', 'Neutrophils/cytology/ultrastructure', 'Phosphorus/metabolism', 'Potassium/metabolism', 'Sodium/metabolism', 'Sulfur/metabolism', 'Tretinoin/*pharmacology']",1998/12/16 00:00,1998/12/16 00:01,['1998/12/16 00:00'],"['1998/12/16 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/12/16 00:01 [medline]', '1998/12/16 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0003-9861(98)90937-7 [pii]', '10.1006/abbi.1998.0937 [doi]']",ppublish,Arch Biochem Biophys. 1998 Dec 15;360(2):149-57. doi: 10.1006/abbi.1998.0937.,['HL56256/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,['Copyright 1998 Academic Press.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In mast cells, specialized secretory cells which secrete a variety of inflammatory mediators by regulated exocytosis, activation of Gi3 provides a sufficient signal for exocytosis [Aridor, M., Rajmilevich, G., Beaven, M. A. & Sagi-Eisenberg, R. (1993) Science 262, 1569-1572]. Such activation can be achieved in patch-clamped or streptolysin-O (SLO)-permeabilized mast cells by a combination of Ca2+ and nonhydrolyzable analogs of GTP. In contrast, Ca2+-activated exocytosis in intact cells is Gi3 independent. We show here that overexpression of a GTPase-deficient mutant (G alpha i3Q204L), but not of the wild-type form of G alpha i3, in rat basophilic leukemia cells (RBL-2H3), a tumor analog of mucosal mast cells, resulted in marked potentiation of exocytosis and release of arachidonic acid in intact cells activated by a Ca2+ ionophore alone or in combination with the phorbol ester 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate. In contrast, exocytosis and arachidonic acid release stimulated by aggregation of the cell surface receptors for immunoglobulin E (IgE) were unaffected. These results strongly suggest that the intracellular receptor, responsible for the activation of Gi3, is a low-affinity Ca2+-binding protein that can only be activated during Ca2+ ionophore stimulation. Moreover, these results also suggest that the propagation of the Ca2+-activated and Gi3-mediated signaling pathway requires the blocking of Gi3 GTPase activity. Finally, our results indicate that release of arachidonic acid is at least one of the downstream effectors of Gi3.","['Zussman, A', 'Hermuet, S', 'Sagi-Eisenberg, R']","['Zussman A', 'Hermuet S', 'Sagi-Eisenberg R']","['Department of Cell Biology and Histology, Sackler School of Medicine, Tel Aviv University, Israel.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Eur J Biochem,European journal of biochemistry,0107600,"['27YG812J1I (Arachidonic Acid)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (GTP Phosphohydrolases)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (GTP-Binding Proteins)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Arachidonic Acid/*metabolism', 'Calcium/*metabolism', 'Cell Line', '*Exocytosis', 'GTP Phosphohydrolases/*genetics/metabolism', 'GTP-Binding Proteins/*genetics', 'Mast Cells/*metabolism', 'Transfection']",1998/12/16 00:00,1998/12/16 00:01,['1998/12/16 00:00'],"['1998/12/16 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/12/16 00:01 [medline]', '1998/12/16 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1046/j.1432-1327.1998.2580144.x [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Biochem. 1998 Nov 15;258(1):144-9. doi: 10.1046/j.1432-1327.1998.2580144.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Leukaemia inhibitory factor (LIF), was named after its effect on haemopoietic cells, and belongs to a group of cytokines which includes CNTF, IL-6, CT-1, OM and IL-11. All group members use the gp130 signal transducing subunit for intracellular signalling, but show differences in biological effect. In vitro and in vivo studies on axotomy and nerve crush models demonstrate a powerful effect of LIF in the survival of both motor and sensory neurones, while reducing denervation induced muscle atrophy. Its effects in muscle also include stimulating myoblast proliferation in vitro, and up-regulation after muscle injury. LIF will also stimulate muscle regeneration in vivo when applied exogenously after injury. In published studies of both axotomy induced neuronal death and in the Wobbler mouse models LIF is active at doses of 10 microg/kg delivered systemically, well below the expected maximum tolerated dose suggested by primate safety studies. LIF is expressed in low levels by spinal cord neurones with significant up-regulation when the neurones are damaged by BOAA toxin, an excitatory amino acid associated with a form of ALS. This augments other evidence suggesting LIF is a trauma factor playing a role in the injury response of adult neuronal tissue, and may be more effective than related growth factors. Taken together, the data suggests LIF is a physiologically relevant trophic factor with implications in clinical medicine as a therapy for ALS, and a human recombinant form (AM424), entered human clinical trials during 1998.","['Kurek, J B', 'Radford, A J', 'Crump, D E', 'Bower, J J', 'Feeney, S J', 'Austin, L', 'Byrne, E']","['Kurek JB', 'Radford AJ', 'Crump DE', 'Bower JJ', 'Feeney SJ', 'Austin L', 'Byrne E']","['AMRAD Corporation Ltd, Melbourne, Australia. jkurek@amrad.com.au']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Netherlands,J Neurol Sci,Journal of the neurological sciences,0375403,"['0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Receptors, Cytokine)', '0 (SOD1 protein, human)', 'EC 1.15.1.1 (Sod1 protein, mouse)', 'EC 1.15.1.1 (Superoxide Dismutase)', 'EC 1.15.1.1 (Superoxide Dismutase-1)']",IM,"['Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis/*drug therapy', 'Animals', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Drug Delivery Systems', 'Growth Inhibitors/chemistry/physiology/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', '*Interleukin-6', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Lymphokines/chemistry/physiology/*therapeutic use', 'Mice', 'Mice, Neurologic Mutants', 'Muscle, Skeletal/drug effects/physiology', 'Nervous System/drug effects', 'Neurons/drug effects', 'Receptors, Cytokine/metabolism', 'Regeneration/drug effects', 'Signal Transduction', 'Superoxide Dismutase/genetics', 'Superoxide Dismutase-1']",1998/12/16 00:00,1998/12/16 00:01,['1998/12/16 00:00'],"['1998/12/16 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/12/16 00:01 [medline]', '1998/12/16 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0022-510X(98)00208-1 [pii]', '10.1016/s0022-510x(98)00208-1 [doi]']",ppublish,J Neurol Sci. 1998 Oct;160 Suppl 1:S106-13. doi: 10.1016/s0022-510x(98)00208-1.,,,,64,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The different characteristics of these peptides, with amphipathic/hydrophobic alpha-helices for CB, amphipathic/amphipathic alpha-helices for CB-1/CB-2, and hydrophobic/hydrophobic alpha-helices for CB-3, were used to study the morphological changes in the bacterial cell, Klebsiella pneumoniae and the leukemia cancer cell, HL-60, by scanning and transmission electron microscopies. The natural and analog peptides have comparable secondary structures as shown by circular dichroism measurements. This indicates that the potency of the peptides on cell membranes is dependent of the helical characteristics rather than the helical strength. The microscopic results show that the morphological changes of the cells treated with CB are distinguishably different from those treated with CB-1/CB-2, which are designed to have enhanced anti-cancer properties by having an extra amphipathic alpha-helix. The morphological differences may be due to their different modes of action on the cell membranes resulting in the different potencies with lower lethal concentration and higher concentration of 50% inhibition (IC50) of CB on bacterium and cancer cell, respectively, as compared with CB-1/:CB-2 (Chen et al. 1997. Biochim. Biophys. Acta 1336, 171-179). In contrast, CB-3 has little effect on either the bacterium or the cancer cell. These results provide microscopic evidence that different killing pathways are involved with the peptides.","['Chan, S C', 'Yau, W L', 'Wang, W', 'Smith, D K', 'Sheu, F S', 'Chen, H M']","['Chan SC', 'Yau WL', 'Wang W', 'Smith DK', 'Sheu FS', 'Chen HM']","['Department of Biochemistry, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Clear Water Bay, Kowloon.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,J Pept Sci,Journal of peptide science : an official publication of the European Peptide Society,9506309,"['0 (Anti-Bacterial Agents)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Insect Proteins)', '0 (Peptides)', '80451-05-4 (cecropin B protein, Insecta)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents/*pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Circular Dichroism', 'HL-60 Cells/*drug effects/*ultrastructure', 'Humans', 'Insect Proteins/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Klebsiella pneumoniae/*drug effects/*ultrastructure', 'Microscopy, Electron', 'Microscopy, Electron, Scanning', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Peptides/chemistry/pharmacology']",1998/12/16 16:59,2000/03/18 09:00,['1998/12/16 16:59'],"['1998/12/16 16:59 [pubmed]', '2000/03/18 09:00 [medline]', '1998/12/16 16:59 [entrez]']",['10.1002/(SICI)1099-1387(199811)4:7%3C413::AID-PSC160%3E3.0.CO;2-W [doi]'],ppublish,J Pept Sci. 1998 Nov;4(7):413-25. doi: 10.1002/(SICI)1099-1387(199811)4:7%3C413::AID-PSC160%3E3.0.CO;2-W.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In addition, a survey was conducted to determine how much those in charge of herds knew about the disease, and to establish the incidence of certain risk factors possibly associated with distribution of the causal agent. Data obtained from 232 completed questionnaires showed that only 54.6% of farms received professional assistance.

This study examined the effect of Bcl-2 overexpression on activation of AP24 and the induction of DNA fragmentation by AP24 in isolated nuclei. It was demonstrated that overexpression of Bcl-2 in either HL-60 or PW leukemia cell lines suppressed activation of AP24 induced by either tumor necrosis factor or UV light and protected cells from apoptosis. Furthermore, nuclei isolated from Bcl-2-overexpressing cells were relatively resistant to internucleosomal DNA fragmentation induced by AP24 isolated from apoptotic cells. Bcl-2-overexpressing cells that were nutritionally depleted of glutathione (GSH) became sensitive to tumor necrosis factor- or UV light-induced activation of AP24 and underwent apoptotic cell death. Moreover, nuclei isolated from Bcl-2-overexpressing cells that were depleted of GSH became sensitive to AP24-induced DNA fragmentation. The addition of exogenous GSH blocked the proteolytic activity of AP24, as well as its ability to induce DNA fragmentation in normal isolated nuclei. These results indicate that Bcl-2 can attenuate at least two events in the AP24 apoptotic pathway: activation of AP24 and induction of DNA fragmentation by activated AP24. Furthermore, agents that deplete intracellular levels of GSH may have therapeutic use in the sensitization of Bcl-2-overexpressing cancer cells to apoptotic cell death.","['Wright, S C', 'Wang, H', 'Wei, Q S', 'Kinder, D H', 'Larrick, J W']","['Wright SC', 'Wang H', 'Wei QS', 'Kinder DH', 'Larrick JW']","['Palo Alto Institute of Molecular Medicine, Mountain View, California 94043, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Nucleosomes)', '0 (Oligopeptides)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '70967-90-7 (N-methoxysuccinyl-alanyl-alanyl-prolyl-valine-4-nitroanilide)', 'EC 3.4.21.- (AP24 apoptotic protease)', 'EC 3.4.21.- (Serine Endopeptidases)', 'GAN16C9B8O (Glutathione)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*physiology', 'Cell Nucleus/drug effects/metabolism/radiation effects', 'DNA Damage', 'DNA, Neoplasm/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Glutathione/metabolism/*pharmacology/physiology', 'HL-60 Cells/drug effects/metabolism/radiation effects', 'Humans', 'Nucleosomes/drug effects/metabolism/radiation effects', 'Oligopeptides/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/biosynthesis/*physiology', 'Serine Endopeptidases/*pharmacology/physiology', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/pharmacology', 'Ultraviolet Rays']",1998/12/16 00:00,1998/12/16 00:01,['1998/12/16 00:00'],"['1998/12/16 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/12/16 00:01 [medline]', '1998/12/16 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1998 Dec 1;58(23):5570-6.,['CA68223/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Katoh et al., Cancer Res., 55: 5687-5692, 1995). In this study, we show that VEGF also inhibits apoptotic cell death that is induced by exposure to the chemotherapeutic drugs etoposide and doxorubicin. To elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying this inhibitory effect of VEGF, we examined expression levels of BCL2 family proteins in CMK86, a human leukemia cell line, after treatment with VEGF. Northern blotting and immunoblotting analyses revealed that the expression level of MCL1, a member of the BCL2 family, was increased by VEGF. Moreover, to examine the effects of MCL1 on apoptotic cell death induced by exposure to etoposide, we generated a clonal U937 myeloid leukemia cell line transfected with vectors that promoted the constitutive expression of MCL1. MCL1 decreased the caspase 3 activity induced by exposure to etoposide and increased the viability of the transfected cells after etoposide exposure. Therefore, MCL1 may be involved in the inhibitory effect of VEGF on apoptotic cell death.","['Katoh, O', 'Takahashi, T', 'Oguri, T', 'Kuramoto, K', 'Mihara, K', 'Kobayashi, M', 'Hirata, S', 'Watanabe, H']","['Katoh O', 'Takahashi T', 'Oguri T', 'Kuramoto K', 'Mihara K', 'Kobayashi M', 'Hirata S', 'Watanabe H']","['Department of Environment and Mutation, Research Institute for Radiation Biology and Medicine, Hiroshima University, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (BAD protein, human)', '0 (BCL2L1 protein, human)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Endothelial Growth Factors)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A)', '0 (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factors)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', '0 (bcl-Associated Death Protein)', '0 (bcl-X Protein)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects/physiology', 'Bone Marrow Cells/cytology', 'Carrier Proteins/biosynthesis', 'Caspase 3', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Doxorubicin/*pharmacology', 'Endothelial Growth Factors/*pharmacology', 'Etoposide/*pharmacology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*cytology/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/drug therapy/pathology', 'Lymphokines/*pharmacology', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*biosynthesis/physiology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/biosynthesis', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/biosynthesis', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factors', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein', 'bcl-Associated Death Protein', 'bcl-X Protein']",1998/12/16 00:00,1998/12/16 00:01,['1998/12/16 00:00'],"['1998/12/16 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/12/16 00:01 [medline]', '1998/12/16 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1998 Dec 1;58(23):5565-9.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

HL-60/AMSA contains a mutant form of topo IIalpha that was thought to explain this resistance. However, our present data show that expression of topo IIbeta RNA in HL-60/AMSA is only 10% of that in HL-60, and topo IIbeta protein levels are undetectable. Southern analysis of topo IIbeta shows no differences in gene dosage between the two cell lines but does show differences in the restriction patterns. These data suggest that decreased topo IIbeta expression may contribute to the intercalator resistance of HL-60/AMSA cells.","['Herzog, C E', 'Holmes, K A', 'Tuschong, L M', 'Ganapathi, R', 'Zwelling, L A']","['Herzog CE', 'Holmes KA', 'Tuschong LM', 'Ganapathi R', 'Zwelling LA']","['University of Texas M.

Coexpression of platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) and PDGF receptors suggests an autocrine mechanism of growth factor stimulation in the development of brain tumors in man. A murine retrovirus coding for the PDGF B-chain was, therefore, used to induce brain tumors in mice. Of 35 mice who received injections, 15 developed brain tumors of oligo- or monoclonal origin. They coexpressed PDGF B-chain and alpha-receptor mRNA, as expected, from an autocrine mechanism of transformation. Most tumors displayed characteristics of glioblastoma multiforme or of a primitive neuroectodermal tumor, and the consistent expression of nestin suggested that they were all derived from an immature neuroglial progenitor. The results show that an autocrine mechanism of transformation may be an initial or early event in neuro-oncogenesis. The present model provides an ideal system for studies of genetic mechanisms involved in the development of brain tumors.","['Uhrbom, L', 'Hesselager, G', 'Nister, M', 'Westermark, B']","['Uhrbom L', 'Hesselager G', 'Nister M', 'Westermark B']","['Department of Genetics and Pathology, University Hospital, Uppsala, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Platelet-Derived Growth Factor)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-sis)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor, Platelet-Derived Growth Factor alpha)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptors, Platelet-Derived Growth Factor)']",IM,"['3T3 Cells/metabolism', 'Animals', 'Brain Neoplasms/*etiology/pathology/virology', 'Clone Cells', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Female', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/*genetics/metabolism', 'Platelet-Derived Growth Factor/biosynthesis/genetics/*physiology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics/*physiology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-sis', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Receptor, Platelet-Derived Growth Factor alpha', 'Receptors, Platelet-Derived Growth Factor/biosynthesis/genetics/physiology', 'Recombinant Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics']",1998/12/16 00:00,1998/12/16 00:01,['1998/12/16 00:00'],"['1998/12/16 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/12/16 00:01 [medline]', '1998/12/16 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1998 Dec 1;58(23):5275-9.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: We studied 380 previously untreated and treated MSKCC patients. Low-risk patients received no cytotoxic therapy. High-risk patients received the N4, N5, or N6 regimens. Dosing per cycle and cumulative dosing of leukemogenic agents peaked with N6, which included four cycles of cyclophosphamide 4,200 mg/m2 and doxorubicin 75 mg/m2, plus three cycles of cisplatin 200 mg/m2 and etoposide 600 mg/m2. We reviewed the literature. RESULTS: t-AML occurred in six MSKCC patients, which included three of 53 patients in whom the only chemotherapy consisted of N6, and three patients treated for relapsed or refractory neuroblastoma; no case of leukemia emerged among the 50 low-risk patients. Four cases were found incidentally in routine follow-up bone marrow tests. The 36-month cumulative incidence of t-AML in the N6 cohort was 7% (95% confidence interval, 0 to 15). Published data parallel the MSKCC experience in that t-AML after neuroblastoma was once rare but has become less so since the mid-1980s, when the intensified use of topoisomerase-II inhibitors and alkylators first gained wide acceptance and produced better response rates and longer survival. CONCLUSION: Neuroblastoma itself is not associated with a host susceptibility to leukemia. However, current neuroblastoma treatment programs that use high-dose cyclophosphamide, cisplatin, and topoisomerase-II inhibitors may entail a considerable risk for t-AML. The incidence of t-AML in neuroblastoma patients may be underestimated because treatment and clinical factors can mask its presence. Efforts to devise effective but less leukemogenic treatment for neuroblastoma or to truncate leukemogenic therapy, eg, by exploiting molecular techniques for the early identification of complete remission, are warranted.","['Kushner, B H', 'Cheung, N K', 'Kramer, K', 'Heller, G', 'Jhanwar, S C']","['Kushner BH', 'Cheung NK', 'Kramer K', 'Heller G', 'Jhanwar SC']","['Department of Biostatistics, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY 10021, USA. kushnerb@mskcc.org']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*adverse effects', 'Cancer Care Facilities', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*chemically induced', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*chemically induced', 'Neuroblastoma/*drug therapy', 'New York']",1998/12/16 00:00,1998/12/16 00:01,['1998/12/16 00:00'],"['1998/12/16 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/12/16 00:01 [medline]', '1998/12/16 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1200/JCO.1998.16.12.3880 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 1998 Dec;16(12):3880-9. doi: 10.1200/JCO.1998.16.12.3880.,['CA61017/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,105,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Trials conducted in this phase cannot be evaluated precisely unless the features that determine prognosis in late chronic-phase CML are identified. The purpose of this study is to define the prognostic determinants of late chronic-phase CML. PATIENTS AND METHODS: From 1980 to 1997,257 consecutive CML patients referred in late chronic phase were studied. Their clinical characteristics at the time of referral and their association with survival were investigated. A staging model was designed. RESULTS: The median survival from time of referral was 43 months. Pretreatment characteristics associated with worse outcome included older age, poor performance status, splenomegaly, low albumin level, high percentage of blasts or basophils in peripheral blood (PB) or bone marrow, longer duration of chronic phase, and poor-risk group as defined by the Synthesis model. Prior exposure to IFN-A was not associated with worse outcome. By multivariate analysis, characteristics associated with shorter survival were age of 60 years or older, time from diagnosis of 3 years or greater, performance status of 1 or greater, PB basophils of 7% or greater, spleen 10 cm or greater, PB blasts 3% or greater, and albumin level less than 4 g/dL. A model that included age, duration of chronic phase, performance status, and PB basophils was generated. Patients with no, one, two, or three or greater adverse factors had median survivals of 71, 49, 26, and 19 months, respectively. CONCLUSION: A staging model for late chronic-phase CML can stratify patients in four groups with significantly different outcomes. If confirmed in independent populations, such a model could be considered in the analysis of future trials of treatment strategies in late chronic-phase CML.","['Rodriguez, J', 'Cortes, J', 'Smith, T', ""O'Brien, S"", 'Rios, M B', 'Talpaz, M', 'Kantarjian, H']","['Rodriguez J', 'Cortes J', 'Smith T', ""O'Brien S"", 'Rios MB', 'Talpaz M', 'Kantarjian H']","['Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas, M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Interferon-alpha)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Interferon-alpha/therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Chronic-Phase/blood/*diagnosis/drug therapy/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Prognosis', 'Sex Factors', 'Survival Analysis']",1998/12/16 00:00,1998/12/16 00:01,['1998/12/16 00:00'],"['1998/12/16 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/12/16 00:01 [medline]', '1998/12/16 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1200/JCO.1998.16.12.3782 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 1998 Dec;16(12):3782-7. doi: 10.1200/JCO.1998.16.12.3782.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this report, we have analyzed the impact on relapse and relapse-free survival (RFS) of detecting immunophenotypical aberrant cells in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) patients in cytomorphologic complete remission (CR). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Two hundred eleven bone marrow (BM) samples from 53 consecutive ALL (37 precursor B-ALL and 16 T-ALL) patients were analyzed. The only selection criteria were to have at least one aberrant immunophenotypic feature at diagosis and to have achieved cytomorphologic CR after induction therapy. For MRD detection, all follow-up samples were analyzed with triple labelings using a two-step acquisition procedure, in which 106 cells were screened for the possible persistence of residual leukemic cells with the same phenotypic aberrancy as that identified diagnosis. RESULTS: Patients who displayed a gradual increase in MRD levels showed a higher relapse rate (90% v22%; P < .00001) and shorter median RFS (12 months v not reached; P < .0001) than those with stable or decreasing MRD levels. This adverse prognostic influence also was observed when children and adults, as well as B-ALL and T-ALL patients, were analyzed separately. An MRD level > or = or greater than 10(-3) discriminated two risk groups of ALL patients with significantly different relapse rates and RFS at all treatment phases (end of induction, consolidation, maintenance, and out of treatment). CONCLUSION: Multiparametric flow cytometry of MRD in ALL patients is a valuable tool for relapse prediction and for the identification of a cohort of patients with very poor prognosis.","['Ciudad, J', 'San Miguel, J F', 'Lopez-Berges, M C', 'Vidriales, B', 'Valverde, B', 'Ocqueteau, M', 'Mateos, G', 'Caballero, M D', 'Hernandez, J', 'Moro, M J', 'Mateos, M V', 'Orfao, A']","['Ciudad J', 'San Miguel JF', 'Lopez-Berges MC', 'Vidriales B', 'Valverde B', 'Ocqueteau M', 'Mateos G', 'Caballero MD', 'Hernandez J', 'Moro MJ', 'Mateos MV', 'Orfao A']","['Servicio de Hematologia Hospital Clinico Universitario, Universidad de Salamanca, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,"['0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/*analysis', 'Bone Marrow Cells/immunology/*pathology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Incidence', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm, Residual', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*diagnosis/immunology/pathology', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'Recurrence']",1998/12/16 00:00,1998/12/16 00:01,['1998/12/16 00:00'],"['1998/12/16 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/12/16 00:01 [medline]', '1998/12/16 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1200/JCO.1998.16.12.3774 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 1998 Dec;16(12):3774-81. doi: 10.1200/JCO.1998.16.12.3774.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: We prospectively studied 334 newly diagnosed cases of this disease, using a comprehensive panel of antibodies that represented five myeloid cluster groups (CD13, CD14, CD15, CD33, and CD65). Blast cells were tested for ETV6 and MLL rearrangement using Southern blot analysis. RESULTS: CD13 was expressed in 13.7% of cases, CD14 in 1%, CD15 in 6.6%, CD33 in 16%, and CD65 in 9.7%. Approximately one third of cases (31.4%) expressed one or more of these antigens (B-cell precursor, 31.9%; T-cell, 28.8%), while 10.5% expressed two or more (B-cell precursor, 11.3%; T-cell, 6.1%). Among the B-cell precursor leukemias, myeloid-associated antigen expression was significantly associated with a lack of hyperdiploidy and rearrangements of ETV6 or MLL gene. Most of the cases with MLL rearrangements (82%) expressed CD65, CD15, and CD33, either alone or in combination, whereas 48% of those with a rearranged ETV6 gene expressed CD13, CD33, or both. Myeloid-associated antigen expression did not correlate with event-free survival, whether the analysis was based on any of the five antigens in our panel or on the three more commonly tested antigens (CD13, CD33, and CD65). Importantly, this finding was not affected by exclusion of patients with ETV6 or MLL gene rearrangements. CONCLUSION: Even though blast cell expression of myeloid-associated antigen expression shows significant associations with specific genetic abnormalities, it lacks prognostic value in childhood ALL.","['Pui, C H', 'Rubnitz, J E', 'Hancock, M L', 'Downing, J R', 'Raimondi, S C', 'Rivera, G K', 'Sandlund, J T', 'Ribeiro, R C', 'Head, D R', 'Relling, M V', 'Evans, W E', 'Behm, F G']","['Pui CH', 'Rubnitz JE', 'Hancock ML', 'Downing JR', 'Raimondi SC', 'Rivera GK', 'Sandlund JT', 'Ribeiro RC', 'Head DR', 'Relling MV', 'Evans WE', 'Behm FG']","[""Department of Hematology-Oncology, St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN 38105, USA. ching-hon.pui@stjude.org""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antigens, CD/*metabolism', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/*metabolism', 'Blotting, Southern', 'Bone Marrow Cells/*immunology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*immunology', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'Prospective Studies']",1998/12/16 00:00,1998/12/16 00:01,['1998/12/16 00:00'],"['1998/12/16 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/12/16 00:01 [medline]', '1998/12/16 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1200/JCO.1998.16.12.3768 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 1998 Dec;16(12):3768-73. doi: 10.1200/JCO.1998.16.12.3768.,"['P01 CA-20180/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA-21765/R37 CA-36401/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA-78224/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: The study population consisted of 1,612 consecutively enrolled protocol patients treated on sequential institutional protocols for newly diagnosed ALL at St Jude Children's Research Hospital (SJCRH) between 1967 and 1988. The median follow-up duration is 15.9 years (range, 5.5 to 29.9 y). RESULTS: The cumulative incidence of brain tumors at 20 years is 1.39% (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.63% to 2.15%). Twenty-two brain tumors (10 high-grade gliomas, one low-grade glioma, and 11 meningiomas) were diagnosed among 21 patients after a median latency of 12.6 years (high-grade gliomas, 9.1 years; meningiomas, 19 years). Tumor type was linked to outcome, with patients who developed high-grade tumors doing poorly and those who developed low-grade tumors doing well. Risk factors for developing any secondary brain tumor included the presence of CNS leukemia at diagnosis, treatment on Total X therapy, and the use of cranial irradiation, which was dose-dependent. Age less than 6 years was associated with an increased risk of developing a high-grade glioma. CONCLUSION: This single-institution study, with a high rate of long-term data capture, demonstrated that brain tumors are a rare, late complication of therapy for ALL. We report many more low-grade tumors than others probably because of exhaustive long-term follow-up evaluation. The importance of limiting cranial radiation is underscored by the dose-dependent tumorigenic effect of radiation therapy seen in this study.","['Walter, A W', 'Hancock, M L', 'Pui, C H', 'Hudson, M M', 'Ochs, J S', 'Rivera, G K', 'Pratt, C B', 'Boyett, J M', 'Kun, L E']","['Walter AW', 'Hancock ML', 'Pui CH', 'Hudson MM', 'Ochs JS', 'Rivera GK', 'Pratt CB', 'Boyett JM', 'Kun LE']","[""Department of Hematology-Oncology, St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN 38105, USA. andrew.walter@stjude.org""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Brain Neoplasms/*etiology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Radiation', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Hospitals, Pediatric', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/*etiology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*radiotherapy', 'Radiotherapy/adverse effects', 'Radiotherapy Dosage', 'Risk Factors', 'Tennessee', 'Treatment Outcome']",1998/12/16 00:00,1998/12/16 00:01,['1998/12/16 00:00'],"['1998/12/16 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/12/16 00:01 [medline]', '1998/12/16 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1200/JCO.1998.16.12.3761 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 1998 Dec;16(12):3761-7. doi: 10.1200/JCO.1998.16.12.3761.,"['P01 CA-20180/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA-23099/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA-21765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: We studied 95 survivors of childhood ALL who were in first remission a median of 11 years (range, 3 to 23 years) after diagnosis and who had never been irradiated outside a cranial field. The bone mass was measured by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry. The results were compared with data on 396 local controls. RESULTS: Adjusted for sex and age, the mean whole-body bone mineral content (BMC) and bone mineral areal density (BMDA) were both significantly reduced (0.4 SDs less than the predicted mean value). This was mainly caused by reduced bone mass in the 33 participants who were aged 19 years or older at follow-up. In these young adults, the mean height for age, bone area for height, and BMC for bone area were all significantly reduced. This indicated that the reduced whole-body bone mass was caused by both reduced bone size and reduced size-adjusted bone mass. Reduced bone size was related to previous cranial irradiation.

To improve the purity of the final product for possibly better tumor cell purging and to make the manufacturer's original procedure more cost-effective, we incubated the cells for 30 min with l-phenylalanine methylester hydrochloride (PME) to reduce the cell number by removing contaminating granulocytes and monocytes in the initial step before incubation with MoAb. Our modification prevented nonspecific interactions between MoAb and magnetic beads, and thereby saved expensive materials for purification. A total of 40 purifications were performed with samples containing a mean of 3.1 x 10(9) blood cells mobilized from 15 children by chemotherapy plus granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF). The entire purification procedure, from the end of apheresis to storage, was completed within 5h. After incubation with PME and double-layered (40/60%) Percoll separation, the number of CD34+ cells was reduced to 48+/-29%, which suggests the possibility that half of the CD34+ cells in the inoculum were nonclonogenic in the hematopoietic progenitor assay. PME/Percoll-treated cells were then subjected to a final isolation procedure with MoAb according to the manufacturer's suggestions, and 52+/-42% and 32+/-22%, respectively, of the CFU-GM and CD34+ cells present in the initial bag inoculums were recovered. The recovery rates were, respectively, 54% and 67%, when the calculation was limited to the isolation procedure with MNoAb. The purity of isolated CD34+ cells and the plating efficiency in methylcellulose culture were, respectively, 77+/-24% and 33+/-13%. Fourteen children were subsequently autografted with purified CD34+ cells after marrow ablative chemotherapy. The median number of days to achieve an ANC of 0.5 x 10(9)/l was 12 and that to achieve a platelet count of 50 x 10(9)/l was 22.5, which were comparable to those in our historical group of 55 patients who underwent transplant with unmanipulated blood cells (13 and 16 days). These results suggest that our modified purification procedure with PME is useful for the initial reduction of cell numbers to save costly materials, and that cells isolated by this procedure can be directly used in clinical transplantation procedures.","['Kawano, Y', 'Takaue, Y', 'Law, P', 'Watanabe, T', 'Abe, T', 'Okamoto, Y', 'Makimoto, A', 'Sato, J', 'Nakagawa, R', 'Kajiume, T', 'Hirao, A', 'Watanabe, A', 'Kuroda, Y']","['Kawano Y', 'Takaue Y', 'Law P', 'Watanabe T', 'Abe T', 'Okamoto Y', 'Makimoto A', 'Sato J', 'Nakagawa R', 'Kajiume T', 'Hirao A', 'Watanabe A', 'Kuroda Y']","['Department of Pediatrics, The University of Tokushima, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Bone Marrow Transplant,Bone marrow transplantation,8702459,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, CD34)', '2577-90-4 (phenylalanine methyl ester)', '47E5O17Y3R (Phenylalanine)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal', '*Antigens, CD34', 'Blood Component Removal', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cryopreservation', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Immunomagnetic Separation/economics/*methods', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/therapy', 'Male', 'Phenylalanine/analogs & derivatives', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/therapy', 'Transplantation, Autologous']",1998/12/16 00:00,1998/12/16 00:01,['1998/12/16 00:00'],"['1998/12/16 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/12/16 00:01 [medline]', '1998/12/16 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.bmt.1701479 [doi]'],ppublish,Bone Marrow Transplant. 1998 Nov;22(10):1011-7. doi: 10.1038/sj.bmt.1701479.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Twenty-two patients recovered within 6-86 days (median, 16 days) of onset. Three predisposing factors were identified for development of late-onset HC by multivariate analysis: allogeneic HSCT, older age (> or = 7 years), and busulphan for pretransplant conditioning were significantly associated with late-onset HC (P=0.022, P=0.044 and P=0.036, respectively). Excretion of adenovirus type 11 was demonstrated in six of 22 patients at the onset of cystitis.

METHODS: The study design was as a nested case-referent study in two cohorts of male Swedish seamen 20-64 years of age at the national census 1960 (n 13,449) and 1970 (n 11,290), respectively. Cases were detected by record linkage with the Swedish Cancer Register 1961-79 and 1971-87, respectively. For each case, three to five age matched referents from the population were selected. Exposure was assessed from data in the Swedish Registry of Seamen and from a register of Swedish ships. RESULTS: Seamen in the 1970 cohort, who had been exposed to cargo vapours for at least one month on chemical or product tankers, had an increased risk of lymphatic and haematopoietic malignancies (Mantel-Haenszel odds ratio (OR) 2.6, 95% confidence interval (95% CI) 1.1 to 5.9)) with a significant exposure-response relation (conditional logistic regression analysis, p = 0.04). The ORs were increased for both lymphoma (3.2), multiple myeloma (4.0), and leukaemia (1.6), but the increase was only significant for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (OR 3.3, 95% CI 1.1 to 10.6). There were no significantly increased risks for the 1960 cohort or for seamen exposed only on crude oil tankers, but these groups had few exposed cases and low cumulative exposure to benzene and other light petroleum products. CONCLUSIONS: Seamen exposed to cargo vapours from gasoline and other light petroleum products on chemical or product tankers had an increased incidence of lymphatic and haematopoietic malignancies. One possible cause is exposure to benzene during loading, unloading, and tank cleaning operations.","['Nilsson, R I', 'Nordlinder, R', 'Horte, L G', 'Jarvholm, B']","['Nilsson RI', 'Nordlinder R', 'Horte LG', 'Jarvholm B']","['Department of Occupational Medicine, Sahlgrenska University Hospital, Goteborg, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Occup Environ Med,Occupational and environmental medicine,9422759,"['0 (Petroleum)', 'J64922108F (Benzene)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Benzene/adverse effects', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*etiology', 'Lymphoma/*etiology', 'Male', 'Medical Record Linkage', 'Middle Aged', 'Multiple Myeloma/*etiology', '*Naval Medicine', 'Occupational Diseases/*etiology', 'Occupational Exposure/adverse effects', 'Petroleum/*adverse effects', 'Risk Factors', 'Time Factors']",1998/12/16 00:00,1998/12/16 00:01,['1998/12/16 00:00'],"['1998/12/16 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/12/16 00:01 [medline]', '1998/12/16 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1136/oem.55.8.517 [doi]'],ppublish,Occup Environ Med. 1998 Aug;55(8):517-21. doi: 10.1136/oem.55.8.517.,,,PMC1757625,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A specific group of NSAIDs (indomethacin, sulindac, tolmetin, acemetacin, zomepirac and mefenamic acid) all at non-toxic levels, significantly increased the cytotoxicity of the anthracyclines (doxorubicin, daunorubicin and epirubicin), as well as teniposide, VP-16 and vincristine, but not the other vinca alkaloids vinblastine and vinorelbine. A substantial number of other anticancer drugs, including methotrexate, 5-fluorouracil, cytarabine, hydroxyurea, chlorambucil, cyclophosphamide, cisplatin, carboplatin, mitoxantrone, actinomycin D, bleomycin, paclitaxel and camptothecin, were also tested, but displayed no synergy in combination with the NSAIDs. The synergistic effect was concentration dependent. The effect appears to be independent of the cyclo-oxygenase inhibitory ability of the NSAIDs, as (i) the synergistic combination could not be reversed by the addition of prostaglandins D2 or E2; (ii) sulindac sulphone, a metabolite of sulindac that does not inhibit the cyclooxygenase enzyme, was positive in the combination assay: and (iii) many NSAIDs known to be cyclo-oxygenase inhibitors, e.g. meclofenamic acid, diclofenac, naproxen, fenoprofen, phenylbutazone, flufenamic acid, flurbiprofen, ibuprofen and ketoprofen, were inactive in the combination assay. The enhancement of cytotoxicity was observed in a range of drug sensitive tumour cell lines, but did not occur in P-170-overexpressing multidrug resistant cell lines. However, in the HL60/ADR and COR L23R cell lines, in which multidrug resistance is due to overexpression of the multidrug resistance-associated protein MRP, a significant increase in cytotoxicity was observed in the presence of the active NSAIDs. Subsequent Western blot analysis of the drug sensitive parental cell lines, DLKP and A549, revealed that they also expressed MRP and reverse-transcription-polymerase chain reaction studies demonstrated that mRNA for MRP was present in both cell lines. It was found that the positive NSAIDs were among the more potent inhibitors of [3H]-LTC4 transport into inside-out plasma membrane vesicles prepared from MRP-expressing cells, of doxorubicin efflux from preloaded cells and of glutathione-S-transferase activity. The NSAIDs did not enhance cellular sensitivity to radiation. The combination of specific NSAIDs with anticancer drugs reported here may have potential clinical applications, especially in the circumvention of MRP-mediated multidrug resistance.","['Duffy, C P', 'Elliott, C J', ""O'Connor, R A"", 'Heenan, M M', 'Coyle, S', 'Cleary, I M', 'Kavanagh, K', 'Verhaegen, S', ""O'Loughlin, C M"", 'NicAmhlaoibh, R', 'Clynes, M']","['Duffy CP', 'Elliott CJ', ""O'Connor RA"", 'Heenan MM', 'Coyle S', 'Cleary IM', 'Kavanagh K', 'Verhaegen S', ""O'Loughlin CM"", 'NicAmhlaoibh R', 'Clynes M']","['National Cell and Tissue Culture Centre, Dublin City University, Glasnevin, Ireland.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Eur J Cancer,"European journal of cancer (Oxford, England : 1990)",9005373,"['0 (Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Drug Combinations)']",IM,"['Adenocarcinoma/*drug therapy', 'Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal/*therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Carcinoma, Squamous Cell/*drug therapy', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Combinations', 'Drug Resistance, Multiple', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Drug Synergism', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy', 'Lung Neoplasms/*drug therapy', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1998/12/16 00:00,1998/12/16 00:01,['1998/12/16 00:00'],"['1998/12/16 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/12/16 00:01 [medline]', '1998/12/16 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0959804998000458 [pii]', '10.1016/s0959-8049(98)00045-8 [doi]']",ppublish,Eur J Cancer. 1998 Jul;34(8):1250-9. doi: 10.1016/s0959-8049(98)00045-8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To elucidate if PML may be involved in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), the expression of PML was analysed using immunohistochemistry in human HCC and hepatitis tissues. Our studies demonstrated overexpression of PML protein in the PML-oncogenic domain (POD) structure in 50% of HCC (11/22). Enhanced expression and cytoplasmic localisation of PML was associated with cirrhosis. Increased expression of PML was also found in liver abscesses. However, in colon metastasis to the liver, the expression of PML was moderate to low, although strong expression was seen in the surrounding interstitial cells, macrophages and lymphocytes, an indication of the inflammation process associated with tumour growth. Most interestingly, strong expression of PML was found in neoplastic cells at the periphery of the tumours, but progressively decreased in cells at the centre of the tumours, which may be associated with an altered transform phenotype or apoptosis. The altered expression of PML indicates that this nuclear protein may play an important role in cellular response to stress and inflammation, as well as in compensatory cell growth.","['Chan, J Y', 'Chin, W', 'Liew, C T', 'Chang, K S', 'Johnson, P J']","['Chan JY', 'Chin W', 'Liew CT', 'Chang KS', 'Johnson PJ']","['Department of Clinical Oncology, Sir Y.K.

A nonprobability, purposive selection process was used to enroll 18 patients admitted to two acute care inpatient hospital units for bone marrow transplantation or leukemia therapy at a university health sciences center in the southeastern United States. Data were collected at baseline, then daily through patient interviews, oral examination, and chart review for at least 3 weeks or until discharge. Research variables were pain intensity, intolerable pain, verbal descriptors of pain, pain relief, and use of pain relief strategies (Pain Assessment Form), mucositis (erythema and ulceration) in eight anatomic locations of the oral cavity (Oral Mucositis Index), voice/talking (Oral Assessment Guide), and mood states (11-item Brief Profile of Mood States). Mild to moderate pain occurred in nearly 70% of patients and was described as ""tender,"" ""irritating,"" and ""sore."" Patients used pain medicines, mouth care, and mental and physical activities to relieve pain, and reported partial overall relief of pain. Mucositis was mild, with the tongue and buccal and labial mucosa most commonly affected with erythema and the buccal mucosa with ulceration. Voice/talking were only mildly impaired, and mood disturbance was mild. Patterns of pain, mucositis, and mood disturbance were consistent with each other and followed the trajectory described in previous research. Results suggest that nurses should continue to assess these symptoms vigorously and assist patients in selecting multiple management strategies. Research using repeated-measures designs in this acutely ill inpatient population is challenging and needs careful attention by researchers. The results have been used to improve the ongoing larger intervention study.","['McGuire, D B', 'Yeager, K A', 'Dudley, W N', 'Peterson, D E', 'Owen, D C', 'Lin, L S', 'Wingard, J R']","['McGuire DB', 'Yeager KA', 'Dudley WN', 'Peterson DE', 'Owen DC', 'Lin LS', 'Wingard JR']","['Nell Hodgson Woodruff School of Nursing, Emory University, Atlanta, Georgia, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Nurs,Cancer nursing,7805358,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*adverse effects', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/*adverse effects', 'Facial Pain/*etiology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*complications/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Oral Ulcer/*etiology', '*Pain Measurement', 'Pilot Projects', 'Prospective Studies']",1998/12/16 00:00,1998/12/16 00:01,['1998/12/16 00:00'],"['1998/12/16 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/12/16 00:01 [medline]', '1998/12/16 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/00002820-199812000-00002 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Nurs. 1998 Dec;21(6):385-93. doi: 10.1097/00002820-199812000-00002.,['1RO1NR03929/NR/NINR NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Daoy medulloblastoma cells were transfected with a long terminal repeat-based retroviral vector containing the EGFP gene. Stable EGFP-expressing clones were isolated and stereotactically injected into the frontal cortex of nude mice. Four weeks later, whole brain sections were examined using fluorescence microscopy, immunohistochemistry, and routine hematoxylin and eosin staining for the visualization and detection of tumor cell invasion and metastasis. RESULTS: We demonstrate that EGFP-transduced Daoy cells maintain stable high-level EGFP expression in the central nervous system during their growth in vivo. EGFP fluorescence clearly demarcated the primary tumor margins and readily allowed for the visualization of distant micrometastases and local invasion on the single-cell level. Small metastatic and locally invasive foci, including those immediately adjacent to the tumor's leading invasive edge, were virtually undetectable by routine hematoxylin and eosin staining and immunohistochemistry. EGFP expression also persisted in vitro after cell reculture from brain tissue extracts. CONCLUSION: We show, for the first time, that EGFP-transduced human brain tumor cells can be visualized by fluorescence microscopy after intracerebral implantation. This method is superior to routine hematoxylin and eosin staining and immunohistochemistry for the detection and study of physiologically relevant patterns of brain tumor invasion and metastasis in vivo.","['MacDonald, T J', 'Tabrizi, P', 'Shimada, H', 'Zlokovic, B V', 'Laug, W E']","['MacDonald TJ', 'Tabrizi P', 'Shimada H', 'Zlokovic BV', 'Laug WE']","['Department of Pediatrics, Neil Bogart Memorial Laboratories, Childrens Hospital of Los Angeles, 90027, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Neurosurgery,Neurosurgery,7802914,"['0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (Luminescent Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (PLAUR protein, human)', '0 (Plaur protein, mouse)', '0 (Receptors, Cell Surface)', '0 (Receptors, Urokinase Plasminogen Activator)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '147336-22-9 (Green Fluorescent Proteins)', 'TDQ283MPCW (Eosine Yellowish-(YS))', 'YKM8PY2Z55 (Hematoxylin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Brain Neoplasms/chemistry/*pathology', 'DNA, Complementary/genetics', 'Eosine Yellowish-(YS)', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', '*Genes, Reporter', 'Green Fluorescent Proteins', 'Hematoxylin', 'Humans', 'Immunoenzyme Techniques', 'Luminescent Proteins/*analysis/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Medulloblastoma/chemistry/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Nude', 'Microscopy, Fluorescence', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/genetics', 'Neoplasm Invasiveness/*diagnosis', 'Neoplasm Metastasis/*diagnosis', 'Neoplasm Proteins/analysis', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Receptors, Cell Surface/analysis', 'Receptors, Urokinase Plasminogen Activator', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/*analysis/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Staining and Labeling/methods', 'Stereotaxic Techniques', 'Terminal Repeat Sequences', 'Transfection', 'Transplantation, Heterologous', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/transplantation']",1998/12/16 00:00,1998/12/16 00:01,['1998/12/16 00:00'],"['1998/12/16 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/12/16 00:01 [medline]', '1998/12/16 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/00006123-199812000-00101 [doi]'],ppublish,Neurosurgery. 1998 Dec;43(6):1437-42; discussion 1442-3. doi: 10.1097/00006123-199812000-00101.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The initial dose level of 2 mg/m2/day was adjusted up or down by 0.5 mg/m2 in subsequent cycles on the basis of haematological and non-haematological toxicities. The five day schedule was selected because published pharmacokinetic studies had indicated that although pentostatin had an elimination half-life of approximately six hours and could inhibit plasma adenosine deaminase activity for 24 hours, recovery of enzyme activity rapidly took place and accumulation of dATP which has a toxic effect on non-replicating lymphoid cells could be increased by repeated dosing. Twenty-nine patients were entered into the study and dose-escalation was possible in nine, while dose reductions were required for five patients. Of the 24 patients evaluable for response, complete responses were achieved in two and partial responses in five for an overall response rate of 29.2%.

However, it is not yet clear how information on MRD can be applied to treatment protocols. METHODS: We monitored 240 patients with childhood ALL who were treated according to national protocols of the International BFM Study Group. 60 patients relapsed and the patients in continuous complete remission (CCR) had a median event-free follow-up of 48 months. Bone-marrow samples were collected at up to nine time points during and after treatment. Standardised PCR analysis of patient-specific immunoglobulin and T-cell receptor gene rearrangements and TAL1 deletions were used as targets for semiquantitative estimation of MRD. Amount of MRD was classed as 10(-2) or more, 10(-3), and 10(-4) or less. FINDINGS: MRD negativity at the various follow-up times was associated with low relapse rates (3-15% at 3 years), but five-fold to ten-fold higher relapse rates (39-86% at 3 years) were found in MRD-positive patients. The distinct degrees of MRD appeared to have independent prognostic value (p [trend]<0.001) at all separate time points, especially at the first two time points (at the end of induction treatment and before consolidation treatment). At these two time points a high degree of MRD (> or = 10(-2)) was associated with a three-fold higher relapse rate when compared with patients with a low degree of MRD (< or = 10(-4)). At later time points (including the end of treatment) even a low degree of MRD was associated with a poor outcome. Positivity in patients in CCR after treatment was rare (< 1%). With the combined MRD information from the first two follow-up time points, it was possible to recognise three different risk groups--55 (43%) were in a low-risk group and had a 3-year relapse rate of only 2% (95% CI 0.05-12%); 19 (15%) were in a high-risk group and had a relapse rate of 75% (55-95%); and 55 (43%) were in an intermediate-risk group and had a 3-year relapse rate of 23% (13-36%). INTERPRETATION: Our collaborative MRD study shows that monitoring patients with childhood ALL at consecutive time points gives clinically relevant insight into the effectiveness of treatment. Combined information on MRD from the first 3 months of treatment distinguishes patients with good prognoses from those with poor prognoses, and this helps in decisions whether and how to modify treatment.","['van Dongen, J J', 'Seriu, T', 'Panzer-Grumayer, E R', 'Biondi, A', 'Pongers-Willemse, M J', 'Corral, L', 'Stolz, F', 'Schrappe, M', 'Masera, G', 'Kamps, W A', 'Gadner, H', 'van Wering, E R', 'Ludwig, W D', 'Basso, G', 'de Bruijn, M A', 'Cazzaniga, G', 'Hettinger, K', 'van der Does-van den Berg, A', 'Hop, W C', 'Riehm, H', 'Bartram, C R']","['van Dongen JJ', 'Seriu T', 'Panzer-Grumayer ER', 'Biondi A', 'Pongers-Willemse MJ', 'Corral L', 'Stolz F', 'Schrappe M', 'Masera G', 'Kamps WA', 'Gadner H', 'van Wering ER', 'Ludwig WD', 'Basso G', 'de Bruijn MA', 'Cazzaniga G', 'Hettinger K', 'van der Does-van den Berg A', 'Hop WC', 'Riehm H', 'Bartram CR']","['Department of Immunology, University Hospital Rotterdam/Erasmus University Rotterdam, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Lancet,"Lancet (London, England)",2985213R,,IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Child', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Europe', 'Humans', '*Neoplasm, Residual', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/diagnosis/drug therapy/*mortality', 'Prognosis', 'Recurrence', 'Survival Analysis', 'Treatment Outcome']",1998/12/16 00:00,1998/12/16 00:01,['1998/12/16 00:00'],"['1998/12/16 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/12/16 00:01 [medline]', '1998/12/16 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0140-6736(98)04058-6 [pii]', '10.1016/S0140-6736(98)04058-6 [doi]']",ppublish,Lancet. 1998 Nov 28;352(9142):1731-8. doi: 10.1016/S0140-6736(98)04058-6.,,['Lancet. 1999 Feb 27;353(9154):752-3.

Bacteremia due to A. xylosoxidans is rare, and little information on treatment is available. Two cases of bacteremia due to A. xylosoxidans in patients with hemapoietic malignancies are reported herein. Case 1 involved a 70-yr. male whose clinical diagnosis was IgA lambda-type plasmacytoma. Case 2 involved 72-yr. male whose clinical diagnosis was acute lymphatic leukemia (L2). Both patients had been catheterized. Neutropenia was noted and the white blood cell counts were 20/microliter in case 1 and 35/microliter in case 2 when A. xylosoxidans was isolated from the blood culture. We suggest that bacteremia due to A. xylosoxidans may have been related to the presence of the catheter and neutropenia.","['Kobayashi, A', 'Mori, K', 'Konishi, M', 'Maeda, K', 'Mikasa, K', 'Yoneda, T', 'Narita, N', 'Sano, R', 'Masutani, T']","['Kobayashi A', 'Mori K', 'Konishi M', 'Maeda K', 'Mikasa K', 'Yoneda T', 'Narita N', 'Sano R', 'Masutani T']","['Second Department of Internal Medicine, Nara Medical University.']",['jpn'],"['Case Reports', 'English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Japan,Kansenshogaku Zasshi,Kansenshogaku zasshi.

In addition, Tax is capable of activating the expression of specific cellular genes and is involved in the transformation of T-lymphocytes resulting in the development of adult T-cell leukemia. Tax is a phosphoprotein that colocalizes in nuclear bodies with RNA polymerase II, splicing complexes, and specific transcription factors including members of the ATF/CREB and NF-kappaB families. In this study, we identified adjacent serine residues at positions 300 and 301 in the carboxy terminus of Tax as the major sites for phosphorylation. Phosphorylation of at least one of these serine residues is required for Tax localization in nuclear bodies and for Tax-mediated activation of gene expression via both the ATF/CREB and NF-kappaB pathways. Introduction of amino acid substitutions which are phosphoserine mimetics at positions 300 and 301 restored the ability of a phosphorylation-defective Tax mutant to form nuclear bodies and to activate gene expression.

High RANTES concentrations increase the infectivity of HIV-1 isolates that use CXC-chemokine receptor 4 for entry. However, RANTES can have a similar enhancing effect on macrophagetropic viruses that enter via CC-chemokine receptor 5 (CCR5), despite binding to the same receptor as the virus. Furthermore, RANTES enhances the infectivity of HIV-1 pseudotyped with the envelope glycoprotein of murine leukemia virus or vesicular stomatitis virus, showing that the mechanism of enhancement is independent of the route of virus-cell fusion. The enhancing effects of RANTES are not mediated via CCR5 or other known chemokine receptors and are not mimicked by MIP-1alpha or MIP-1beta. The N-terminally modified derivative aminooxypentane RANTES (AOP-RANTES) efficiently inhibits HIV-1 infection via CCR5 but otherwise mimics RANTES by enhancing viral infectivity. There are two mechanisms of enhancement: one apparent when target cells are pretreated with RANTES (or AOP-RANTES) for several hours, and the other apparent when RANTES (or AOP-RANTES) is added during virus-cell absorption. We believe that the first mechanism is related to cellular activation by RANTES, whereas the second is an increase in virion attachment to target cells.","['Gordon, C J', 'Muesing, M A', 'Proudfoot, A E', 'Power, C A', 'Moore, J P', 'Trkola, A']","['Gordon CJ', 'Muesing MA', 'Proudfoot AE', 'Power CA', 'Moore JP', 'Trkola A']","['The Aaron Diamond AIDS Research Center, New York, New York, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (CD4 Antigens)', '0 (Chemokine CCL3)', '0 (Chemokine CCL4)', '0 (Chemokine CCL5)', '0 (Macrophage Inflammatory Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, CCR5)']",IM,"['CD4 Antigens/physiology', 'Calcium Signaling', '*Cell Fusion', 'Chemokine CCL3', 'Chemokine CCL4', 'Chemokine CCL5/*pharmacology', 'HIV-1/*drug effects/genetics/physiology', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Macrophage Inflammatory Proteins/pharmacology', 'Receptors, CCR5/physiology', 'Transcription, Genetic/drug effects']",1998/12/16 00:00,1998/12/16 00:01,['1998/12/16 00:00'],"['1998/12/16 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/12/16 00:01 [medline]', '1998/12/16 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.73.1.684-694.1999 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 1999 Jan;73(1):684-94. doi: 10.1128/JVI.73.1.684-694.1999.,"['R01 AI041420/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'AI41420/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States']",,PMC103875,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

But transduction can be inefficient even in cells that divide rapidly. For example, exposure of 208F rat embryo fibroblasts to an excess of an amphotropic retrovirus vector encoding alkaline phosphatase results in a transduction efficiency of only about 10%, even though these cells divide rapidly. Here we show that transduction of 208F cells is limited by cell surface retrovirus receptor levels; overexpression of the amphotropic retrovirus receptor Pit2 markedly improved the transduction efficiency to 50%. To characterize receptor levels and binding affinity, we synthesized a fusion protein that joins the amino terminus of the amphotropic envelope protein to the Fc region of a human immunoglobulin G1 molecule for use in binding assays. In comparison to the parental cell line, the modified cell line showed an order of magnitude increase in binding sites of from 18,000 to 150,000 per cell. Thus, efficient transduction by an amphotropic retrovirus vector requires high-level expression of the retrovirus receptor Pit2. These results provide the rationale for further examination of the role of receptor levels in inefficient transduction, especially with regard to target cells for gene therapy, where a high transduction rate is often crucial.","['Kurre, P', 'Kiem, H P', 'Morris, J', 'Heyward, S', 'Battini, J L', 'Miller, A D']","['Kurre P', 'Kiem HP', 'Morris J', 'Heyward S', 'Battini JL', 'Miller AD']","['Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, Washington 98109, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Receptors, Virus)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Division', 'Cell Line', '*Gene Transfer Techniques', 'Genetic Therapy', '*Genetic Vectors', 'Humans', 'Rats', 'Receptors, Virus/analysis/*physiology', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/biosynthesis', 'Retroviridae/*genetics']",1998/12/16 00:00,1998/12/16 00:01,['1998/12/16 00:00'],"['1998/12/16 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/12/16 00:01 [medline]', '1998/12/16 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.73.1.495-500.1999 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 1999 Jan;73(1):495-500. doi: 10.1128/JVI.73.1.495-500.1999.,"['P30 DK047754/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'HL36444/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 HL036444/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL54881/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'DK47754/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'P50 HL054881/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",,PMC103856,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In a molecular clone (MCF 247-W) of the murine leukemia virus MCF 247, a leukemogenic mink cell focus-inducing (MCF) virus, the U3 enhancer sequences are tandemly repeated in the LTR. We mutated the enhancer region of MCF 247-W to test the hypothesis that the duplicated enhancer sequences of this virus have a sequence-specific and/or a stereospecific role in enhancer function required for transformation. In one virus, we inserted 14 nucleotide bp into the novel sequence generated at the junction of the two enhancers to generate an MCF virus with an interrupted enhancer region. In the second virus, only one copy of the enhancer sequences was present. This second virus also lacked the junction sequence present between the two enhancers of MCF 247-W. Both viruses were less leukemogenic and had a longer mean latency period than MCF 247-W. These data indicate that the sequence generated at the junction of the two enhancers and/or the stereospecific arrangement of the two enhancer elements are required for the full oncogenic potential of MCF 247-W. We analyzed proviral LTRs within the c-myc locus in tumor DNAs from mice injected with the MCF virus with the interrupted enhancer region. Some of the proviral LTRs integrated upstream of c-myc contain enhancer regions that are larger than those of the injected virus.

AP-1 sites within the visna virus LTR, which can be bound by the cellular transcription factors Fos and Jun, are also necessary for Tat-mediated transcriptional activation. A potential mechanism by which the visna virus Tat protein could target the viral promoter is by protein-protein interactions with Fos and/or Jun bound to AP-1 sites in the visna virus LTR. Once targeted to the visna virus promoter, the Tat protein could then interact with basal transcription factors to activate transcription. To examine protein-protein interactions with cellular proteins at the visna virus promoter, we used an in vitro protein affinity chromatography assay and electrophoretic mobility shift assay, in addition to an in vivo two-hybrid assay, to show that the visna virus Tat protein specifically interacts with the cellular transcription factors Fos and Jun and the basal transcription factor TBP (TATA binding protein). The Tat domain responsible for interactions with Fos and Jun was localized to an alpha-helical domain within amino acids 34 to 69 of the protein. The TBP binding domain was localized to amino acids 1 to 38 of Tat, a region previously described by our laboratory as the visna virus Tat activation domain. The bZIP domains of Fos and Jun were found to be important for the interactions with Tat. Mutations within the basic domains of Fos and Jun abrogated binding to Tat in the in vitro assays. The visna virus Tat protein was also able to interact with covalently cross-linked Fos and Jun dimers. Thus, the visna virus Tat protein appears to target AP-1 sites in the viral promoter in a mechanism similar to the interaction of human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 Tax with the cellular transcription factor CREB, by binding the basic domains of an intact bZIP dimer. The association between Tat, Fos, and Jun would position Tat proximal to the viral TATA box, where the visna virus Tat activation domain could contact TBP to activate viral transcription.","['Morse, B A', 'Carruth, L M', 'Clements, J E']","['Morse BA', 'Carruth LM', 'Clements JE']","['Division of Comparative Medicine, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, Maryland 21205, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Basic-Leucine Zipper Transcription Factors)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (G-Box Binding Factors)', '0 (Gene Products, tat)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-fos)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-jun)', '0 (TATA-Box Binding Protein)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Basic-Leucine Zipper Transcription Factors', 'Binding Sites', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*metabolism', 'G-Box Binding Factors', 'Gene Products, tat/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-fos/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-jun/*metabolism', 'Sheep', 'TATA-Box Binding Protein', '*Terminal Repeat Sequences', 'Transcription Factors/*metabolism', 'Visna-maedi virus/*genetics']",1998/12/16 00:00,1998/12/16 00:01,['1998/12/16 00:00'],"['1998/12/16 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/12/16 00:01 [medline]', '1998/12/16 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.73.1.37-45.1999 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 1999 Jan;73(1):37-45. doi: 10.1128/JVI.73.1.37-45.1999.,"['R01 NS023039/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 NS007392/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States', 'NS07392/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States', 'NS23039/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States']",,PMC103805,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The amino acid composition of this protein is high in hydrophilic and polar residues except for a patch of relatively hydrophobic amino acids found in the carboxyl-terminal 16 amino acids. Internal cleavage of p6(Gag) between Y36 and P37, apparently by the HIV-1 protease, removes this hydrophobic tail region from approximately 30% of the mature p6(Gag) proteins in HIV-1MN. To investigate the importance of this cleavage and the hydrophobic nature of this portion of p6(Gag), site-directed mutations were made at the minor protease cleavage site and within the hydrophobic tail. The results showed that all of the single-amino-acid-replacement mutants exhibited either reduced or undetectable cleavage at the site yet almost all were nearly as infectious as wild-type virus, demonstrating that processing at this site is not important for viral replication. However, one exception, Y36F, was 300-fold as infectious the wild type. In contrast to the single-substitution mutants, a virus with two substitutions in this region of p6(Gag), Y36S-L41P, could not infect susceptible cells. Protein analysis showed that while the processing of the Gag precursor was normal, the double mutant did not incorporate Env into virus particles. This mutant could be complemented with surface glycoproteins from vesicular stomatitis virus and murine leukemia virus, showing that the inability to incorporate Env was the lethal defect for the Y36S-L41P virus. However, this mutant was not rescued by an HIV-1 Env with a truncated gp41(TM) cytoplasmic domain, showing that it is phenotypically different from the previously described MA mutants that do not incorporate their full-length Env proteins. Cotransfection experiments with Y36S-L41P and wild-type proviral DNAs revealed that the mutant Gag dominantly blocked the incorporation of Env by wild-type Gag. These results show that the Y36S-L41P p6(Gag) mutation dramatically blocks the incorporation of HIV-1 Env, presumably acting late in assembly and early during budding.","['Ott, D E', 'Chertova, E N', 'Busch, L K', 'Coren, L V', 'Gagliardi, T D', 'Johnson, D G']","['Ott DE', 'Chertova EN', 'Busch LK', 'Coren LV', 'Gagliardi TD', 'Johnson DG']","['AIDS Vaccine Program, SAIC/Frederick, National Cancer Institute, Frederick Cancer Research and Development Center, Frederick, Maryland 21702-1201, USA. ott@avpvx1.ncifcrf.gov']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Gene Products, env)', '0 (Gene Products, gag)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Gene Products, env/chemistry/*physiology', 'Gene Products, gag/chemistry/*physiology', 'HIV-1/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutagenesis, Site-Directed', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', '*Virus Assembly', 'Virus Replication']",1998/12/16 00:00,1998/12/16 00:01,['1998/12/16 00:00'],"['1998/12/16 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/12/16 00:01 [medline]', '1998/12/16 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.73.1.19-28.1999 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 1999 Jan;73(1):19-28. doi: 10.1128/JVI.73.1.19-28.1999.,['N01-CO-56000/CO/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,PMC103803,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

There are, however, inconsistencies regarding the published properties of LDL receptor regulation in AML cells, and previous data on this are indirect. In the present study the aim was to determine whether the LDL receptor number is increased in AML cells. The LDL receptor number was assayed by ligand blot with rabbit 125I-labeled beta-very-low-density lipoprotein (beta-VLDL) of transferred, SDS-polyacrylamide-gel-electrophoresis-separated AML cell membranes. Samples from 10 patients, six with AML, one with chronic myelogenous leukemia in blast crisis, and three with acute lymphoblastic leukemia, were investigated. The LDL receptor expression was strongly suppressed in all samples to levels lower than that of normal mononuclear cells. This was despite the fact that cells from one patient with AML of M4 subtype had a 50- to 100-fold higher 125I labeled LDL degradation compared with normal cells. Immunoblots with antibodies against gp330/megalin and the LDL-receptor-related protein (LRP) and ligand blot using 125I-labeled 39-kd receptor-associated protein (RAP) could not detect gp330/megalin or VLDL receptors. The LRP was abundant in AML samples of M4 and M5b subtype, as determined from both RAP ligand blot and immunoblot using an LRP-specific antibody. It is concluded that LDL receptors are suppressed in AML cells. It is possible that the high degradation of 125I-labeled LDL present in type M4 and M5 AML cells may involve another lipoprotein receptor.","['Rudling, M', 'Gafvels, M', 'Parini, P', 'Gahrton, G', 'Angelin, B']","['Rudling M', 'Gafvels M', 'Parini P', 'Gahrton G', 'Angelin B']","['Center for Metabolism and Endocrinology, Department of Medicine, NOVUM, Karolinska Institute at Huddinge University Hospital, Sweden. mats.rudling@cnt.ki.se']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Am J Pathol,The American journal of pathology,0370502,"['0 (Heymann Nephritis Antigenic Complex)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Receptors, LDL)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adrenal Glands/metabolism', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Animals', 'Cattle', 'Female', 'Heymann Nephritis Antigenic Complex', 'Humans', 'Immunoblotting', 'Kidney/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*metabolism', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/metabolism', 'Middle Aged', 'Receptors, LDL/*metabolism']",1998/12/10 00:00,1998/12/10 00:01,['1998/12/10 00:00'],"['1998/12/10 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/12/10 00:01 [medline]', '1998/12/10 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0002-9440(10)65706-9 [pii]', '10.1016/S0002-9440(10)65706-9 [doi]']",ppublish,Am J Pathol. 1998 Dec;153(6):1923-35. doi: 10.1016/S0002-9440(10)65706-9.,,,PMC1866319,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

For children with non-B-cell ALL (n=2602), the event-free survival (p-EFS) increased from 0.53+/-0.02 (diagnosed 7/81-6/86) to 0.67+/-0.02 (7/86-12/91) to 0.78+/-0.02 (1/92-12/96). The corresponding p-EFS values at 5 y were 0.57, 0.70 and 0.78, respectively. The main improvements were seen in the group of children with non-high risk leukaemia, with 5-y p-EFS values increasing from 0.60 to 0.76 and 0.85 for the three periods. In high-risk patients, progress has been moderate, especially in children with high white blood cell values at diagnosis. During the last 5-y period, only 10% of the patients received cranial irradiation in first remission while 90% of the patients received high doses of cytostatic infusions (methotrexate isolated or combined with cytarabinoside) and multiple intrathecal injections of methotrexate as CNS-adjusted treatment without any indication of an increased CNS relapse rate.","['Gustafsson, G', 'Kreuger, A', 'Clausen, N', 'Garwicz, S', 'Kristinsson, J', 'Lie, S O', 'Moe, P J', 'Perkkio, M', 'Yssing, M', 'Saarinen-Pihkala, U M']","['Gustafsson G', 'Kreuger A', 'Clausen N', 'Garwicz S', 'Kristinsson J', 'Lie SO', 'Moe PJ', 'Perkkio M', 'Yssing M', 'Saarinen-Pihkala UM']","['Childhood Cancer Research Unit, Karolinska Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Norway,Acta Paediatr,"Acta paediatrica (Oslo, Norway : 1992)",9205968,,IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Clinical Protocols', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy', 'Probability', 'Prognosis', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Scandinavian and Nordic Countries', 'Survival Analysis', 'Treatment Outcome']",1998/12/10 00:00,1998/12/10 00:01,['1998/12/10 00:00'],"['1998/12/10 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/12/10 00:01 [medline]', '1998/12/10 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/080352598750031149 [doi]'],ppublish,Acta Paediatr. 1998 Nov;87(11):1151-61. doi: 10.1080/080352598750031149.,,['Acta Paediatr. 1999 Apr;88(4):360-2.

The protein was assembled and immature empty particles were released from the insect cells, which were ascertained by Western blotting, sucrose density gradients analysis and electron microscopy. When the Gag-Pro-Pol precursor proteins were expressed by the recombinant baculovirus, mature particles were produced. However, deletion of the pol gene did not affect the viral formation, which was different from the process of virion production of HIV-1. This was explained by the facts that HTLV-II could yield Gag-Pro precursor protein, which was expected to have protease activity by itself. Moreover, the results were consistent with low production of Gag-Pro-Pol precursor proteins, which were translated by double frameshifting.","['Takahashi, R']",['Takahashi R'],"['Second Department of Pathology, Hokkaido University School of Medicine, Sapporo, Japan.']",['jpn'],['Journal Article'],Japan,Hokkaido Igaku Zasshi,[Hokkaido igaku zasshi] The Hokkaido journal of medical science,17410290R,"['0 (Fusion Proteins, gag-pol)', '0 (Gene Products, gag)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Baculoviridae/*genetics', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Fusion Proteins, gag-pol/genetics/metabolism/physiology', 'Gene Deletion', 'Gene Products, gag/physiology', '*Genetic Vectors', '*Human T-lymphotropic virus 2/genetics', 'Insecta/cytology', 'Rabbits', 'Recombinant Proteins', 'Transfection', '*Virion/physiology']",1998/12/10 00:00,1998/12/10 00:01,['1998/12/10 00:00'],"['1998/12/10 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/12/10 00:01 [medline]', '1998/12/10 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Hokkaido Igaku Zasshi. 1998 Sep;73(5):451-61.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The purpose of this work is to: 1) review that history; 2) explore the techniques that have brought cancer genetics to its present state of knowledge; and 3) to provide preliminary data on how cytogenetics, fluorescence in situ-hybridization (FISH) and molecular techniques contribute to the diagnosis of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML). Conventional cytogenetics provided the first chromosomal marker for malignancy in 1960. This was to be known as the so-called Philadelphia chromosome. Additional chromosomal changes associated with various hematologic malignancies followed in the 1970s after chromosomal banding was perfected. FISH, polymerase chain reaction (PCR), reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) and other molecular techniques followed. Using these techniques, the diagnosis and prognosis of CML continue to evolve. The current study evaluates 21 patients by conventional cytogenetics and compares the percentage of t(9;22) metaphases with FISH information on the bone marrow and peripheral blood specimens of the same patients. The correlation of the techniques in this small study is 100 percent. Depending on the cutoff for abnormal FISH, 10 percent or less of the FISH studies on bone marrow or peripheral blood are false negatives. Conventional cytogenetics is used as the present gold standard. FISH and molecular techniques are complementary and will provide additional significant information in the future.","['Glassman, A B']",['Glassman AB'],"['M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030-4095, USA.']",['eng'],"['Historical Article', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,Ann Clin Lab Sci,Annals of clinical and laboratory science,0410247,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)']",IM,"['Chromosome Aberrations/history', 'Chromosome Disorders', '*Cytogenetics', 'DNA, Neoplasm/analysis', 'History, 20th Century', 'Humans', '*In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/diagnosis/genetics', 'Neoplasms/*diagnosis/*genetics', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction']",1998/12/10 00:00,1998/12/10 00:01,['1998/12/10 00:00'],"['1998/12/10 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/12/10 00:01 [medline]', '1998/12/10 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Ann Clin Lab Sci. 1998 Nov-Dec;28(6):324-30.,,,,19,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

When grown in the presence of SCF, ELM cells can still differentiate in response to erythropoietin (Epo), but growth on stroma prevents this. We previously isolated a stroma-independent ELM variant, ELM-I-1, that is also defective in Epo-induced differentiation. We show here that this variant has an activating mutation in the Kit receptor, converting aspartic acid 814 to histidine. Expression of the mutant receptor in stroma-dependent ELM-D cells causes growth factor-independent proliferation and also gives the cells a selective advantage, in terms of proliferation rate and clonegenicity, compared with ELM-D cells grown in optimal amounts of SCF. Expression of the mutant receptor in ELM-D cells also prevents spontaneous differentiation, but not differentiation induced by Epo. Analysis of mitogenic signaling pathways in these cells shows that the mutant receptor induces constitutive activation of p42/p44 mitogen-activated protein kinases. It also selectively inhibits the expression of p66Shc but not the p46/p52 Shc isoforms (as did treatment of ELM cells with SCF), which is of interest, because p66Shc is known to play an inhibitory role in growth factor signaling.","['Leslie, N R', ""O'Prey, J"", 'Bartholomew, C', 'Harrison, P R']","['Leslie NR', ""O'Prey J"", 'Bartholomew C', 'Harrison PR']","['Beatson Institute for Cancer Research, CRC Beatson Laboratories, Glasgow, Scotland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (Adaptor Proteins, Vesicular Transport)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Fli1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Protein c-fli-1)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Shc Signaling Adaptor Proteins)', '0 (Shc1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Src Homology 2 Domain-Containing, Transforming Protein 1)', '0 (Stem Cell Factor)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '11096-26-7 (Erythropoietin)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit)']",IM,"['*Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing', '*Adaptor Proteins, Vesicular Transport', 'Animals', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects/genetics', 'Cell Division/drug effects/genetics', 'Cell Line', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/biosynthesis', 'Erythropoietin/*pharmacology', 'Gene Expression', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*metabolism/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Phosphorylation', 'Point Mutation', 'Protein Biosynthesis', 'Proto-Oncogene Protein c-fli-1', '*Proto-Oncogene Proteins', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/biosynthesis', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit/*genetics/metabolism', 'Shc Signaling Adaptor Proteins', 'Src Homology 2 Domain-Containing, Transforming Protein 1', 'Stem Cell Factor/pharmacology', 'Stromal Cells/*cytology', 'Trans-Activators/biosynthesis', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Stem Cell Assay']",1998/12/09 00:00,1998/12/09 00:01,['1998/12/09 00:00'],"['1998/12/09 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/12/09 00:01 [medline]', '1998/12/09 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)57708-2 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1998 Dec 15;92(12):4798-807.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

For example, a cohort of pediatric patients with ALL retrospectively analyzed for the TEL/AML1 fusion treated on Dana-Farber Cancer Institute (DFCI) ALL Consortium protocols between 1980 to 1991 demonstrated a 100% relapse-free survival in TEL/AML1-positive patients with a median of 8.3 years of follow-up. However, two recent studies analyzing pediatric patients with relapsed ALL have reported the same incidence of the TEL/AML1 rearrangement as in patients with newly diagnosed ALL, suggesting that TEL/AML1 positivity is not a favorable prognostic indicator. To clarify this apparent discrepancy, 48 pediatric patients treated on Dana-Farber Cancer Institute (DFCI) protocols with ALL at first or second relapse were tested for TEL/AML1 using reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The TEL/AML1 fusion was identified in only 1 of 32 analyzable relapsed ALL patients, in concordance with our previous reports of improved disease-free survival in TEL/AML1-positive patients. The low frequency of TEL/AML1-positive patients at relapse is significantly different than that reported in other studies. Although there are several potential explanations for the observed differences in TEL/AML1-positive patients at relapse, it is plausible that relapse-free survival in TEL/AML1-positive patients may be changed with different therapeutic approaches. Taken together, these results support the need for prospective analysis of prognosis in TEL/AML1-positive patients.","['Loh, M L', 'Silverman, L B', 'Young, M L', 'Neuberg, D', 'Golub, T R', 'Sallan, S E', 'Gilliland, D G']","['Loh ML', 'Silverman LB', 'Young ML', 'Neuberg D', 'Golub TR', 'Sallan SE', 'Gilliland DG']","[""Division of Hematology-Oncology, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Department of Pediatric Oncology the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (TEL-AML1 fusion protein)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Bone Marrow/chemistry', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Gene Frequency/*genetics', 'Genetic Testing', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*genetics', '*Oncogene Proteins, Fusion', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/diagnosis/*genetics', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'Prognosis', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'Recurrence', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Translocation, Genetic']",1998/12/09 00:00,1998/12/09 00:01,['1998/12/09 00:00'],"['1998/12/09 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/12/09 00:01 [medline]', '1998/12/09 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)57707-0 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1998 Dec 15;92(12):4792-7.,['CA68484/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],['Blood. 1999 Jul 1;94(1):374-6.

Defects in CD95/CD95L (Fas-Ligand)-apoptotic pathway have been recognized in autoimmune lymphoproliferative diseases (ALPS) and lpr or gld mice and attributed to CD95 and CD95L gene mutations, respectively. Large granular lymphocyte (LGL) leukemia is a chronic disease characterized by a proliferation of antigen-activated cytotoxic T lymphocytes. Autoimmune features such as hypergammaglobulinemia, rheumatoid factor, and circulating immune complexes are common features in LGL leukemia and ALPS. Therefore, we hypothesize that expansion of leukemic LGL may be secondary to a defective CD95 apoptotic pathway. In this study, we investigated expression of CD95 and CD95L in 11 patients with CD3(+) LGL leukemia and explored the apoptotic response to agonistic CD95 monoclonal antibody (MoAb). We found that leukemic LGL from each patient expressed constitutively high levels of CD95/CD95L, similar to those seen in normal activated T cells. However, cells from 9 of these 11 patients were totally resistant to anti-CD95-induced apoptosis. Similarly, cells were resistant to anti-CD3-MoAb-triggered cell death. Lack of anti-CD95-induced apoptosis was not due to mutations in the CD95 antigen. Leukemic LGL were not intrinsically resistant to CD95-dependent death, because LGL from all but 1 patient underwent apoptosis after phytohemagglutinin/interleukin-2 activation. The patient whose leukemic LGL were intrinsically resistant to CD95 had an aggressive form of LGL leukemia that was resistant to combination chemotherapy. These findings that leukemic LGL are resistant to CD95-dependent apoptosis despite expressing high levels of CD95 are similar to observations made in CD95L transgenic mice. These data suggest that LGL leukemia may be a useful model of dysregulated apoptosis causing human malignancy and autoimmune disease.","['Lamy, T', 'Liu, J H', 'Landowski, T H', 'Dalton, W S', 'Loughran, T P Jr']","['Lamy T', 'Liu JH', 'Landowski TH', 'Dalton WS', 'Loughran TP Jr']","[""H.

In this study, we have constructed an expression cDNA library from the leukemia cells of a patient with CML and used the autologous serum to screen for high-titer IgG antibodies directed at the leukemia-derived proteins. We isolated eight distinct clones from the library, suggesting that multiple immune responses were elicited in the autologous host. Sequence analysis showed high degrees of homology to known gene sequences in six of the eight clones. Neither bcr-abl nor proteinase 3 sequences were isolated. Using Northern blot analysis, seven of the eight clones showed ubiquitous expression in normal bone marrow, leukemia cell lines, fresh leukemia cells, and normal tissues. However, clone no. 4 showed restricted mRNA expression, being only detected in some fresh leukemia cells, K562 cells, and normal testicular RNA. Using bacterial lysates in dot blot analysis, a panel of sera from normal individuals and patients with CML and other hematological malignancies were screened for high-titer antibodies against these eight clones. There were, among the CML patients, signficantly higher prevalence of antibodies against seven of the eight clones. They were observed even after omitting from the analysis patients with multiple myeloma whose associated immune paresis may impair immune responses to these proteins. Interestingly, antibodies against these proteins were also detected in a small number of normal individuals. Although the precise clinical significance of our findings remains to be determined, this study provides evidence in support of the potential immunogenicity of leukemia-derived proteins in the autologous host. It also provides basis for further investigations to characterize these proteins, especially clone no. 4, and determine their potential for immune targeting in CML.","['Ling, M', 'Wen, Y J', 'Lim, S H']","['Ling M', 'Wen YJ', 'Lim SH']","['Department of Haematology, University of Wales College of Medicine, Cardiff, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antibodies)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antibodies/blood/*metabolism', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/analysis/genetics', 'Blotting, Northern', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'DNA, Complementary/analysis', 'Female', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Library', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*immunology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics/*immunology', 'Organ Specificity', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction']",1998/12/09 00:00,1998/12/09 00:01,['1998/12/09 00:00'],"['1998/12/09 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/12/09 00:01 [medline]', '1998/12/09 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)57704-5 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1998 Dec 15;92(12):4764-70.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This rearrangement results in a shortened chromosome 22, designated the Philadelphia (Ph) chromosome. The Ph chromosome has been found in cells from all hematopoietic lineages except mature T lymphocytes. To examine this issue, we combined fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) to study lineage involvement of mature cells and stem cells in 12 patients with CML in the chronic phase. We found Ph chromosomes in myeloid cells and most B lymphocytes (CD19(+)) but not in mature T cells (CD3(+)) or natural killer (NK) cells (CD3(-)56(+)). Moreover, evidence of BCR/ABL fusion was found in pluripotent stem cells (CD34(+)Thy-1(+)), B-progenitor cells (CD34(+)CD19(+)), T/NK progenitor cells (CD34(+)CD7(+) cells), and T progenitor cells (CD34(+)CD7(+)CD5(+)) with a frequency equal to that in all CD34(+) cells isolated by FACS from bone marrow cells. T lymphocytes showed a marked decrease in Ph+ cells between progenitor cells and mature cells. Moreover, the ratios of Ph+ to Ph- cells in mature T cells and NK cells were below background levels, whereas Ph+ B lymphocytes also decreased during their maturation. These data suggest that Ph+ lymphocytes are eliminated during differentiation. In contrast to FISH of blood and bone marrow, which gives information principally about mature cells, the technique of ""sorter FISH (FACS + FISH)"" provides a powerful tool to explore the cytogenetic changes in immature cell populations of stem cell diseases based on immunophenotypes. Further clarification of genetic changes in stem cells could be achieved by using sorter FISH with monoclonal antibodies.","['Takahashi, N', 'Miura, I', 'Saitoh, K', 'Miura, A B']","['Takahashi N', 'Miura I', 'Saitoh K', 'Miura AB']","['Third Department of Internal Medicine, Akita University School of Medicine, Akita, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (MAS1 protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Mas)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antigens, CD34/analysis', 'B-Lymphocytes/chemistry/ultrastructure', 'Bone Marrow Cells/ultrastructure', 'Cell Lineage', 'Cell Separation', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Genes, abl/genetics', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Killer Cells, Natural/chemistry/ultrastructure', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Chronic-Phase/*genetics', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/ultrastructure', 'Lymphocyte Subsets/*ultrastructure', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Philadelphia Chromosome', 'Proto-Oncogene Mas', 'Stem Cells/*ultrastructure', 'T-Lymphocytes/chemistry/ultrastructure']",1998/12/09 00:00,1998/12/09 00:01,['1998/12/09 00:00'],"['1998/12/09 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/12/09 00:01 [medline]', '1998/12/09 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)57703-3 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1998 Dec 15;92(12):4758-63.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We recently reported that thrombopoietin induces tyrosine phosphorylation of Crkl in normal platelets. In this study, we demonstrate that thrombopoietin induces association of Crkl with a tyrosine phosphorylated 95- to 100-kD protein in platelets and in UT7/TPO cells, a thrombopoietin-dependent megakaryocytic cell line. With specific antibodies against STAT5, we demonstrate that the 95- to 100-kD protein in Crkl immunoprecipitates is STAT5. This coimmunoprecipitation was specific in that Crkl immunoprecipitates do not contain STAT3, although STAT3 becomes tyrosine phosphorylated in thrombopoietin-stimulated platelets. The coimmunoprecipitaion of Crkl with STAT5 was inhibited by the immunizing peptide for Crkl antisera or phenyl phosphate (20 mmol/L). After denaturing of Crkl immunoprecipitates, Crkl was still immunoprecipitated by Crkl antisera. However, coimmunoprecipitation of STAT5 was not observed. Coincident with STAT5 tyrosine phosphorylation, thrombopoietin induces activation of STAT5 DNA-binding activity as demonstrated by electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA). Using a beta-casein promoter STAT5 binding site as a probe, we have also demonstrated that Crkl antisera supershift the STAT5-DNA complex, suggesting that Crkl is a component of the complex in the nucleus. Furthermore, interleukin-3 (IL-3), granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), and erythropoietin also induce Crkl-STAT5 complex formation in responding cells in a stimulation-dependent manner. In vitro, glutathione S-transferase (GST)-Crkl bound to STAT5 inducibly through its SH2 domain. These results indicate that thrombopoietin, IL-3, GM-CSF, and erythropoietin commonly induce association of STAT5 and Crkl and that the complex translocates to the nucleus and binds to DNA. Interestingly, such association between STAT5 and Crkl was not observed in cytokine-stimulated murine cells, suggesting an intriguing possibility that components of the human STAT5-DNA complex may be different from those of the murine counterpart.","['Ozaki, K', 'Oda, A', 'Wakao, H', 'Rhodes, J', 'Druker, B J', 'Ishida, A', 'Wakui, M', 'Okamoto, S', 'Morita, K', 'Handa, M', 'Komatsu, N', 'Ohashi, H', 'Miyajima, A', 'Ikeda, Y']","['Ozaki K', 'Oda A', 'Wakao H', 'Rhodes J', 'Druker BJ', 'Ishida A', 'Wakui M', 'Okamoto S', 'Morita K', 'Handa M', 'Komatsu N', 'Ohashi H', 'Miyajima A', 'Ikeda Y']","['Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, and Blood Center, Keio University, Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Acute-Phase Proteins)', '0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (CRKL protein)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Immune Sera)', '0 (Interleukin-3)', '0 (Milk Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Phosphoproteins)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT3 protein, human)', '0 (STAT5 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Stat3 protein, mouse)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '11096-26-7 (Erythropoietin)', '42HK56048U (Tyrosine)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', '9014-42-0 (Thrombopoietin)']",IM,"['Acute-Phase Proteins/metabolism', '*Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing', 'Animals', 'Blood Platelets/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Nucleus/metabolism', 'DNA/metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*metabolism', 'Erythropoietin/pharmacology', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Immune Sera/metabolism', 'Interleukin-3/pharmacology', 'Mice', '*Milk Proteins', 'Nuclear Proteins/*metabolism', 'Phosphoproteins/metabolism', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Precipitin Tests', 'Protein Binding/drug effects', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor', 'STAT5 Transcription Factor', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Thrombopoietin/*pharmacology', 'Trans-Activators/*metabolism', 'Tyrosine/metabolism', 'src Homology Domains/physiology']",1998/12/09 00:00,1998/12/09 00:01,['1998/12/09 00:00'],"['1998/12/09 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/12/09 00:01 [medline]', '1998/12/09 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)57692-1 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1998 Dec 15;92(12):4652-62.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, T-cell depletion increases the risk of graft rejection. This study examined the use of CD52 monoclonal antibodies to eliminate T cells from both donor marrow and recipient to prevent both GVHD and rejection. Seventy patients receiving HLA-identical sibling transplants for acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) in first remission were studied. An IgM (CAMPATH-1M) was used for in vitro depletion of the graft and an IgG (CAMPATH-1G) for in vivo depletion of the recipient before graft infusion. No posttransplant immunosuppression was given. Results were compared with two control groups: (1) 50 patients who received bone marrow depleted with CAMPATH-1M, but no CAMPATH-1G in vivo; and (2) 459 patients reported to the International Bone Marrow Transplant Registry (IBMTR) who received nondepleted grafts and conventional GVHD prophylaxis with cyclosporin A (CyA) and methotrexate (MTX). The incidence of acute GVHD was 4% in the treatment group compared with 35% in the CyA/MTX group (P <.001). Chronic GVHD was also exceptionally low in the treatment group (3% v 36%; P <.001). The problem of graft rejection, which had been frequent in the historic CAMPATH-1M group (31%), was largely overcome in the treatment group (6%). Thus, transplant-related mortality of the treatment group (15% at 5 years) was lower than for the CyA/MTX group (26%; P =.04). There was little difference in the risk of leukemia relapse between the treatment group (30% at 5 years) and the CyA/MTX group (29%). Survival of the treatment group at 6 months was better than the CyA/MTX group (92% v 78%), although at 5 years the difference was not significant (62% v 58%) and neither was the difference in leukemia-free survival (60% v 52%). We conclude that T-cell depletion is a useful strategy to prevent GVHD, provided that measures are taken to ensure engraftment. Using CAMPATH-1G to deplete residual host lymphocytes is a simple and practical method to do this. At least in AML, the beneficial reduction in GVHD can be achieved without an increased risk of relapse.","['Hale, G', 'Zhang, M J', 'Bunjes, D', 'Prentice, H G', 'Spence, D', 'Horowitz, M M', 'Barrett, A J', 'Waldmann, H']","['Hale G', 'Zhang MJ', 'Bunjes D', 'Prentice HG', 'Spence D', 'Horowitz MM', 'Barrett AJ', 'Waldmann H']","['Sir William Dunn School of Pathology, University of Oxford, UK. geoff.hale@path.ox.ac.uk']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized)', '0 (Antibodies, Neoplasm)', '0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)', '3A189DH42V (Alemtuzumab)', '83HN0GTJ6D (Cyclosporine)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Alemtuzumab', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/therapeutic use', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized', 'Antibodies, Neoplasm', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation/mortality', 'Cyclosporine/therapeutic use', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Graft Rejection/*prevention & control', 'Graft vs Host Disease/drug therapy/*prevention & control', 'Humans', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*therapy', '*Lymphocyte Depletion', 'Methotrexate/therapeutic use', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Prognosis', 'Time Factors', '*Transplantation Conditioning', 'Treatment Outcome']",1998/12/09 00:00,1998/12/09 00:01,['1998/12/09 00:00'],"['1998/12/09 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/12/09 00:01 [medline]', '1998/12/09 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)57685-4 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1998 Dec 15;92(12):4581-90.,['P01 CA-40053/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

At a median observation of 32 months, the rates of survival and freedom from treatment failure (FFTF) were estimated to be 91% (95% confidence interval 83% to 99%) and 90% (82% to 98%). These results show that a moderate dose escalation of adriamycin, cyclophosphamide, and etoposide of the baseline BEACOPP regimen is feasible. The escalated BEACOPP regimen shows very encouraging results in advanced stage HD and is now being compared in a randomized phase III study with BEACOPP at baseline dose level.","['Tesch, H', 'Diehl, V', 'Lathan, B', 'Hasenclever, D', 'Sieber, M', 'Ruffer, U', 'Engert, A', 'Franklin, J', 'Pfreundschuh, M', 'Schalk, K P', 'Schwieder, G', 'Wulf, G', 'Dolken, G', 'Worst, P', 'Koch, P', 'Schmitz, N', 'Bruntsch, U', 'Tirier, C', 'Muller, U', 'Loeffler, M']","['Tesch H', 'Diehl V', 'Lathan B', 'Hasenclever D', 'Sieber M', 'Ruffer U', 'Engert A', 'Franklin J', 'Pfreundschuh M', 'Schalk KP', 'Schwieder G', 'Wulf G', 'Dolken G', 'Worst P', 'Koch P', 'Schmitz N', 'Bruntsch U', 'Tirier C', 'Muller U', 'Loeffler M']","['Klinik I fur Innere Medizin, Universitat Koln, Koln, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '11056-06-7 (Bleomycin)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '35S93Y190K (Procarbazine)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'PVI5M0M1GW (Filgrastim)', 'VB0R961HZT (Prednisone)', 'BEACOPP protocol']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/administration & dosage/*adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Bleomycin/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Cyclophosphamide/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Doxorubicin/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Etoposide/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Female', 'Filgrastim', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/administration & dosage/therapeutic use', 'Hodgkin Disease/*drug therapy/mortality/pathology/radiotherapy', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/chemically induced', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/chemically induced', 'Prednisone/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Procarbazine/administration & dosage/adverse effects', '*Radiotherapy, Adjuvant', 'Recombinant Proteins', 'Remission Induction', 'Survival Rate', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Vincristine/administration & dosage/adverse effects']",1998/12/09 00:00,1998/12/09 00:01,['1998/12/09 00:00'],"['1998/12/09 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/12/09 00:01 [medline]', '1998/12/09 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)57682-9 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1998 Dec 15;92(12):4560-7.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The efficiency of CML cell elimination was studied by means of flow cytometry and reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis. Cultures containing only OKT3 and IL-2, with or without IFNgamma, resulted in tumor cell reduction to the level of RT-PCR negativity. The length of the culture period required to reach a RT-PCR-negative state ranged from 3 to 33 days. A 1- to 2-log reduction in leukemic cells could be achieved by culture medium alone. In contrast, 3- to 4-log reductions in CML cells were observed following in vitro culture and ex vivo T cell activation with a given sensitivity for RT-PCR detection of 1 bcr/abl+ cell in 10(4). The feasibility of purging chronic myelogenous leukemia cells in a short time was associated with a low number of platelet counts (r=0.6457; p < 0.05). CML cell reduction was associated with expansion of CD25+/CD4+//CD8+/-/CD56+/- lymphocytes.

In this study we show that the product of the proto-oncogene c-Cbl, whose function is still unknown, is constitutively tyrosine phosphorylated not only in cells from chronic myelogenous leukemias (CMLs) in the blast phase, but also in cells from acute myeloblastic leukemias (AMLs), Ph-negative acute T-lymphoblastic leukemias (T-ALLs), and Ph-negative pre-B lymphoblastic leukemias (pre-B ALL). Moreover, in acute leukemia cells, c-Cbl was not stably complexed with the tyrosine-phosphorylated adaptor protein CrkL. The analysis of Grb2/c-Cbl interaction demonstrated that, in both acute leukemia and CML blasts, c-Cbl was stably complexed with the N-terminal Src homology (SH) 3 domain of Grb2 and, in blasts from ALL patients, with the Grb2 SH2 domain. The analysis of c-Cbl subcellular distribution showed that in all cases of leukemia tested, as well as in growth factor-stimulated M-07e cells, c-Cbl was present in the cytosolic, in the membrane, and in the detergent-insoluble fractions. Finally, in polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMNs) from CML patients, c-Cbl was found stably associated with the detergent-insoluble fraction, whereas in PMNs from normal donors, it was detected only in the cytosolic fraction. Our findings that c-Cbl is constitutively tyrosine phosphorylated and associated with the detergent-insoluble fraction in AML and ALL blasts and in PMNs from CML patients suggest that this event represents a common step in the neoplastic transformation of both myeloid and lymphoid progenitor cells.","['Brizzi, M F', 'Rosso, A', 'Dentelli, P', 'Ferrero, D', 'Lanfrancone, L', 'Pegoraro, L']","['Brizzi MF', 'Rosso A', 'Dentelli P', 'Ferrero D', 'Lanfrancone L', 'Pegoraro L']","['Department of Internal Medicine, University of Turin, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (CRKL protein)', '0 (GRB2 Adaptor Protein)', '0 (GRB2 protein, human)', '0 (MAS1 protein, human)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Mas)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '21820-51-9 (Phosphotyrosine)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-cbl)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases)', 'EC 6.3.2.- (CBL protein, human)']",IM,"['*Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing', 'Blotting, Western', 'GRB2 Adaptor Protein', 'Humans', 'Immunosorbent Techniques', 'Leukemia/*metabolism/pathology', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/metabolism/pathology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/metabolism/pathology', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/metabolism/pathology', 'Nuclear Proteins/analysis/metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Phosphotyrosine/*metabolism', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/metabolism/pathology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/metabolism', 'Proteins/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Mas', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*analysis/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-cbl', 'Subcellular Fractions/*chemistry', '*Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases', 'src Homology Domains']",1998/12/09 00:00,1998/12/09 00:01,['1998/12/09 00:00'],"['1998/12/09 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/12/09 00:01 [medline]', '1998/12/09 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Exp Hematol. 1998 Dec;26(13):1229-39.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Previous in vitro models have shown cross-resistance between the purine analog 2-chlorodeoxyadenosine (cladribine) and the pyrimidine analogs 2',2'-difluorodeoxycytidine (gemcitabine) and 1-beta-D-arabinofuranosylcytosine (cytosine arabinoside, cytarabine) with reduced deoxycytidine kinase (dCK) activity as the underlying determinant of resistance. In this study, we continuously exposed the human promyelocytic leukemia cell line HL60 to as much as 1024 nM cladribine. After limiting dilution, the cladribine concentrations that caused 50% growth inhibition (IC50) of the two clones R13 and R23 were 33.3- and 18.7-fold, respectively, higher than the IC50 of the parental HL60 cells (8.7+/-1.3 nM). These cladribine-resistant clones, however, showed no cross-resistance to gemcitabine and only 3.3- and 2.7-fold resistance to cytarabine, respectively. Characterization of both clones revealed stably elevated levels of purine-specific ""high-Michaelis constant (Km)"" 5'-nucleotidase (5'-NT) messenger RNA expression and specific activity, whereas pyrimidine-specific ""low-Km"" 5'-NT activity was undetectable, and dCK activity was only marginally decreased in R13. Thus, the ratio of dCK (specific for cladribine) to high-Km 5'-NT activity in R13 and R23 was reduced to 65.3% and 63.7%, respectively. These results show that changes of high-Km 5'-NT activity can induce cladribine resistance, without cross-resistance to gemcitabine.","['Schirmer, M', 'Stegmann, A P', 'Geisen, F', 'Konwalinka, G']","['Schirmer M', 'Stegmann AP', 'Geisen F', 'Konwalinka G']","['Department of Internal Medicine, University of Innsbruck, Austria. michael.schirmer@uibk.ac.at']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '0W860991D6 (Deoxycytidine)', '47M74X9YT5 (Cladribine)', '8L70Q75FXE (Adenosine Triphosphate)', 'B76N6SBZ8R (gemcitabine)', 'EC 2.7.1.74 (Deoxycytidine Kinase)', ""EC 3.1.3.5 (5'-Nucleotidase)""]",IM,"[""5'-Nucleotidase/genetics/*metabolism"", 'Adenosine Triphosphate/pharmacology', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic', 'Antineoplastic Agents', 'Blotting, Northern', 'Cladribine/*pharmacology', 'Cytarabine/*pharmacology', 'Cytoplasm/enzymology', 'Deoxycytidine/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Deoxycytidine Kinase/metabolism', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'HL-60 Cells/*drug effects/enzymology', 'Humans', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism']",1998/12/09 00:00,1998/12/09 00:01,['1998/12/09 00:00'],"['1998/12/09 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/12/09 00:01 [medline]', '1998/12/09 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Exp Hematol. 1998 Dec;26(13):1223-8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS AND MATERIALS: In vitro studies were carried out with HT-29 human colon carcinoma cells. In vivo studies were carried out using L5178Y(TK-) murine lymphoma implanted in DBA/2 mice. RESULTS: Pretreatment of HT-29 cells to nontoxic concentration of AG337 (<10 microM) for a short period of time (< 24 h) significantly enhanced the radiation induced cell lethality. The radiosensitizing enhancement ratio was 1.7. In contrast, there was no increased cell killing when the drug was exposed immediately after irradiation. In studies using L5178Y(TK-) tumors, the drug alone (50 mg/kg, i.p. x 5) had a minimal tumor growth delay, while a single dose of radiation (17 Gy) resulted in < 10% tumor control at day 30. When radiation and drug (17 Gy + AG337, 50 mg/kg, i.p. x 5) were combined, the tumor control rate reached 90% at Day 30. Using the local tumor control assay (TCD50), the radiation dose modification factor after a single dose of radiation was 2.6. CONCLUSION: The concentration of drug shown to be of radiosensitizing value in the in vivo studies is achievable in humans. The results of the present study further supports the potential utility of AG337 in the treatment of human tumors by radiotherapy.","['Kim, S H', 'Brown, S L', 'Kim, J H']","['Kim SH', 'Brown SL', 'Kim JH']","['Henry Ford Hospital, Department of Radiation Oncology, Detroit, MI 48202, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys,"International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics",7603616,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Quinazolines)', 'EC 2.1.1.45 (Thymidylate Synthase)', 'K75ZUN743Q (nolatrexed)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/*pharmacology', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Drug Therapy, Combination', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'HT29 Cells/drug effects/radiation effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia L5178/drug therapy/radiotherapy', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred DBA', 'Quinazolines/pharmacology', 'Thymidylate Synthase/*antagonists & inhibitors']",1998/12/09 00:00,1998/12/09 00:01,['1998/12/09 00:00'],"['1998/12/09 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/12/09 00:01 [medline]', '1998/12/09 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0360301698003381 [pii]', '10.1016/s0360-3016(98)00338-1 [doi]']",ppublish,Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 1998 Nov 1;42(4):789-93. doi: 10.1016/s0360-3016(98)00338-1.,['CA64323/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This presentation requires the coordinated expression of several genes contained in the MHC, including those encoding the MHC class I heavy chain, the proteins LMP-2 and LMP-7, which are involved in the proteasomal degradation of cytosolic antigens into peptide fragments that are destined for association with MHC class I molecules, and TAP-1 and TAP-2, which transport these fragments across the membrane of the endoplasmic reticulum at the start of their journey to the cell surface. In many virus-transformed cell lines and spontaneous tumours, these genes are simultaneously repressed. However, the key factor(s) that are essential for their expression and repression have not been identified. Here we report that the proto-oncogene product PML induces expression of LMP-2, LMP-7, TAP-1 and TAP-2 in an MHC-class I-negative, recurrent tumour, leading to the re-expression of cell-surface MHC in tumours and to rejection of the tumours. PML also regulates MHC expression in untransformed fibroblasts.

We directly compared the ability of four strains of genetically immunodeficient mice (NOD/SCID, SCID, Nude and Rag-1-deficient) to successfully engraft and support the human cell lines Daudi, Raji, Namalwa and Molt-4 as subcutaneous tumors. We additionally examined the effect of further immunosuppression of the mice by whole body irradiation at a dose of 600 cGy for Nude and Rag-1 and 300 cGy for SCID mice and by administration of anti-natural killer (asialo-GM1) antibody on tumor growth. Mice with each of the defects supported xenografts to varying degrees. We found differences in growth characteristics in the cell lines tested, with Namalwa consistently producing the largest tumors. With all cell lines studied, optimal growth was achieved using NOD/SCID mice. Overall, tumor growth was somewhat enhanced by pretreatment with radiation with little additional benefit from the addition of anti-asialo-GM1 antibody. The importance of multiple components of the innate and adoptive immune system in xenotransplantation were best demonstrated when results in untreated NOD/SCID mice were compared to SCID, nude and RAG-1-deficient mice.

We have used multidimensional flow cytometry in a study of patients with cytopenias and found that this technology established, changed, or refined the diagnosis in 17/121 patients. Using the flow cytometric technique of CD45 and right angle light scatter (SSC) gating with two additional markers in a three-color analysis, eight of 121 patients were found to have hairy cell leukemia (HCL), in the absence of definitive morphologic findings of HCL. Two additional patients were found to have non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL). Myeloid abnormalities, myelodysplasia (MDS) or acute leukemia was detected in seven of 56 patients with unexplained pancytopenia. Six of 65 patients identified with cytopenias resulting from lymphoid neoplasms had been referred for bone marrow transplantation (BMT) with a presumptive diagnosis of MDS, with subsequent deferral of BMT upon correct diagnosis. The screening technique is incorporated into an extensive immunophenotyping scheme to identify hematopoietic abnormalities using multidimensional flow cytometry (MDF). HCL cells (detected as low as 1.3%) reside in the same position as normal monocytes in the CD45 and SSC plots but could be distinguished from monocytes based on the expression of HLA-DR without CD11b, and expression of CD19. Further phenotyping of the abnormal population confirmed immunoglobulin light chain restriction, CD11c, and CD25 expression. Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma was detected as aberrant mature lymphocytes expressing B lymphoid markers, CD5 and light chain restriction. Myeloid abnormalities were identified in the myeloblast or maturing myeloid cell fractions. The flow cytometric scheme described can be used in primary diagnosis. The technique is definitive, sensitive, and stresses the importance of distinguishing lymphoid from myeloid etiology of cytopenias.","['Wells, D A', 'Hall, M C', 'Shulman, H M', 'Loken, M R']","['Wells DA', 'Hall MC', 'Shulman HM', 'Loken MR']","['HematoLogics, Inc., Seattle, WA 98104, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry/*methods', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Hairy Cell/complications/*diagnosis', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/complications/*diagnosis', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/complications/*diagnosis', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/complications/*diagnosis', 'Pancytopenia/etiology', 'Retrospective Studies']",1998/12/09 00:00,1998/12/09 00:01,['1998/12/09 00:00'],"['1998/12/09 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/12/09 00:01 [medline]', '1998/12/09 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2401219 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 1998 Dec;12(12):2015-23. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2401219.,"['CA18029/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA47748/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A large prospective study in childhood ALL has shown that MRD analysis using immunoglobulin (Ig) and T cell receptor (TCR) gene rearrangements as PCR targets can identify good and poor prognosis groups of substantial size that might profit from treatment adaptation. This MRD-based risk group assignment was based on the kinetics of tumor reduction. Consequently, the level of MRD has to be defined precisely in follow-up samples. However, current PCR methods do not allow easy and accurate quantification. We have tested 'real-time' quantitative PCR (RQ-PCR) using the TaqMan technology and compared its sensitivity with two conventional MRD-PCR methods, ie dot-blot and liquid hybridization of PCR amplified Ig/TCR gene rearrangements using clone-specific radioactive probes. In RQ-PCR the generated specific PCR product is measured at each cycle ('real-time') by cleavage of a fluorogenic intrinsic TaqMan probe. The junctional regions of rearranged Ig/TCR genes define the specificity and sensitivity of PCR-based MRD detection in ALL and are generally used to design a patient-specific probe. In the TaqMan technology we have chosen for the same approach with the design of patient-specific TaqMan probes at the position of the junctional regions. We developed primers/probe combinations for RQ-PCR analysis of a total of three IGH, two TCRD, two TCRG and three IGK gene rearrangements in four randomly chosen precursor-B-ALL. In one patient, 12 bone marrow follow-up samples were analyzed for the presence of MRD using an IGK PCR target. The sensitivity of the RQ-PCR technique appeared to be comparable to the dot-blot method, but less sensitive than liquid hybridization. Although it still is a relatively expensive method, RQ-PCR allows sensitive, reproducible and quantitative MRD detection with a high throughput of samples providing possibilities for semi-automation. We consider this novel technique as an important step forward towards routinely performed diagnostic MRD studies.","['Pongers-Willemse, M J', 'Verhagen, O J', 'Tibbe, G J', 'Wijkhuijs, A J', 'de Haas, V', 'Roovers, E', 'van der Schoot, C E', 'van Dongen, J J']","['Pongers-Willemse MJ', 'Verhagen OJ', 'Tibbe GJ', 'Wijkhuijs AJ', 'de Haas V', 'Roovers E', 'van der Schoot CE', 'van Dongen JJ']","['Dept of Immunology, University Hospital Rotterdam/Erasmus University Rotterdam, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,['0 (DNA Probes)'],IM,"['Adult', 'Child', 'DNA Probes/genetics', '*Gene Rearrangement, T-Lymphocyte', '*Genes, Immunoglobulin', '*Genes, T-Cell Receptor', 'Humans', 'Neoplasm, Residual/*diagnosis/genetics', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction/*methods', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*diagnosis/genetics', 'Sensitivity and Specificity']",1998/12/09 00:00,1998/12/09 00:01,['1998/12/09 00:00'],"['1998/12/09 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/12/09 00:01 [medline]', '1998/12/09 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2401246 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 1998 Dec;12(12):2006-14. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2401246.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

One of the most important laboratory features used to accurately risk stratify patients is the presence of specific chromosomal translocation within the leukemic blasts. In this paper, we describe a multiplex reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay for the accurate, sensitive, and rapid identification of chimeric transcripts encoded by the major risk-stratifying translocations of pediatric ALL. This assay will identify both the CML- and ALL-type BCR-ABL transcripts encoded by the t(9;22), all described variants of the E2A-PBX1 transcripts encoded by the t(1;19), the MLL-AF4 transcripts encoded by the t(4;11), and all variants of TEL-AML1 encoded by the t(12;21). In addition, we have developed a reverse dot-blot detection system as an alternative to traditional post-PCR Southern blot analysis. Application of this combined assay to the analysis of 70 leukemic samples and five cell lines resulted in a complete concordance between this multiplex assay and individual PCR reactions. The characteristics of the multiplex assay suggest that its application to routine clinical screening will significantly improve the ability of clinical laboratories to accurate risk stratify pediatric ALL patients.","['Scurto, P', 'Hsu Rocha, M', 'Kane, J R', 'Williams, W K', 'Haney, D M', 'Conn, W P', 'Shurtleff, S A', 'Downing, J R']","['Scurto P', 'Hsu Rocha M', 'Kane JR', 'Williams WK', 'Haney DM', 'Conn WP', 'Shurtleff SA', 'Downing JR']","[""Department of Hematology/Oncology, St Jude Children's Research Hospital, and University of Tennessee College of Medicine, Memphis 38105, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (MLL-AF4 fusion protein, human)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Oligonucleotide Probes)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (TEL-AML1 fusion protein)', '146150-85-8 (E2A-Pbx1 fusion protein)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Child', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/analysis', 'Homeodomain Proteins/analysis', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/genetics/therapy', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*analysis', 'Oligonucleotide Probes/genetics', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*analysis', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics/therapy', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction/*methods', '*Translocation, Genetic']",1998/12/09 00:00,1998/12/09 00:01,['1998/12/09 00:00'],"['1998/12/09 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/12/09 00:01 [medline]', '1998/12/09 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2401224 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 1998 Dec;12(12):1994-2005. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2401224.,['CA-21765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In three secondary PCL evaluated serially, CD56 was also lacking at diagnosis showing that CD56 is not downregulated at the end stage of the disease but rather not upregulated in this subset of patients. This last concept is strengthened by the observation that 29% of MM patients lacking CD56 or weakly expressing it at diagnosis present a detectable leukemic phase vs 11% only in CD561 MM (P=0.06).

We conclude that the lack or weak expression of CD56 is a characteristic feature of PCL but also delineates a special subset of MM at diagnosis mainly characterized by a lower osteolytic potential and a trend for malignant plasma cells to circulate in the peripheral blood more overtly.","['Pellat-Deceunynck, C', 'Barille, S', 'Jego, G', 'Puthier, D', 'Robillard, N', 'Pineau, D', 'Rapp, M J', 'Harousseau, J L', 'Amiot, M', 'Bataille, R']","['Pellat-Deceunynck C', 'Barille S', 'Jego G', 'Puthier D', 'Robillard N', 'Pineau D', 'Rapp MJ', 'Harousseau JL', 'Amiot M', 'Bataille R']","['INSERM U 463, Hotel-Dieu, Nantes, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (CD28 Antigens)', '0 (CD56 Antigen)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)']",IM,"['Bone Marrow/metabolism', 'CD28 Antigens/metabolism', 'CD56 Antigen/*metabolism', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Plasma Cell/diagnosis/*metabolism', 'Multiple Myeloma/diagnosis/*metabolism', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*metabolism', 'Plasma Cells/metabolism']",1998/12/09 00:00,1998/12/09 00:01,['1998/12/09 00:00'],"['1998/12/09 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/12/09 00:01 [medline]', '1998/12/09 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2401211 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 1998 Dec;12(12):1977-82. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2401211.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

At the time of PBSC mobilization, 25 patients were in first remission, while 22 patients had a history of previous treatment failure. At the same time, 43 patients had polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-positive cells in samples from bone marrow (BM) and/or peripheral blood (PB). Independent of the remission status, high-dose cytarabine and mitoxantrone with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) support were administered for PBSC mobilization. Following high-dose conditioning therapy which consisted of cyclophosphamide (200 mg/kg) and hyperfractionated total body irradiation (TBI, 14.4 Gy) or BEAM (carmustine, etoposide, cytarabine, melphalan), 34 patients received PCR-positive and 13 patients received PCR-negative autografts. After a median follow-up time of 20 months (range, 6-50) post-transplantation, 33 patients were in remission, while 14 patients had relapsed after a median time of 14.5 months (range, 10-42). Using the Andersen-Gill proportional hazards regression model for the analysis of relapse-free survival, we found that PCR-positive findings in samples from BM and/or PB at any given time-point after transplantation were associated with an increased estimated hazard ratio of 4.5 in comparison with a PCR-negative finding (P=0.013). On the other hand, patients included while they were in first remission had a smaller estimated hazard ratio of 0.3 when compared with patients with a history of previous treatment failure (P=0.048). For the latter group of patients, this translates into a significantly smaller probability of relapse-free survival in comparison to patients who were in first remission at the time of PBSC-mobilization (P=0.012). In conclusion, the remission status of the patients before autografting and the PCR status as assessed on the occasion of follow-up examinations are significant prognostic parameters for relapse-free survival in patients with follicular lymphoma undergoing high-dose therapy with PBSC autografting.","['Moos, M', 'Schulz, R', 'Martin, S', 'Benner, A', 'Haas, R']","['Moos M', 'Schulz R', 'Martin S', 'Benner A', 'Haas R']","['Department of Internal Medicine V, University of Heidelberg, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', 'BZ114NVM5P (Mitoxantrone)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 14', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 18', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage', 'Female', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/therapeutic use', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Mobilization', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma, Follicular/diagnosis/*drug therapy/genetics', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/diagnosis/*drug therapy/genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mitoxantrone/administration & dosage', 'Neoplasm, Residual', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Prognosis', 'Recurrence', 'Remission Induction', '*Translocation, Genetic']",1998/12/09 00:00,1998/12/09 00:01,['1998/12/09 00:00'],"['1998/12/09 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/12/09 00:01 [medline]', '1998/12/09 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2401242 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 1998 Dec;12(12):1971-6. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2401242.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Four out of seven AML cases were sensitive to in vivo treatment with DT-huGM-CSF at both evaluation time points. In three of these cases, elimination of human cells was demonstrated by flow cytometry and STR-PCR. One AML case showed moderate sensitivity for DT-huGM-CSF, and growth of the two remaining AML cases was not influenced by DT-huGM-CSF. Sensitivity was correlated with GM-CSFR expression.

Comparison of subclones with deleted vs intact chromosomes 2 has allowed the identification of a growth related phenotypic pattern which correlates with the deletion, viz the retention of a marker of immature cells, resistance to inhibition by lipopolysaccharide (LPS), even in the presence of markers of mature myeloid cells, such as resistance to killing by apoptosis-inducing agents. The phenotype is shared by chromosome 2-deleted cell lines derived from conventional tumors. We have begun to investigate the mechanism of the phenotype. The LPS resistance does not correlate with lack of mRNA for CD14, a known cell surface receptor for this agent, or with failure to induce TNF alpha or nitric oxide synthase in response to its binding.

Caspase-3 cleavage is triggered by the mitochondrial release and cytosolic accumulation of the electron transfer protein, cytochrome c (cyt c). Taxol-induced G2/M transition is mediated by p34(cdc-2) (CDK1) which, if prematurely activated, may also trigger apoptosis. In the present studies following S-phase synchronization and release, HL-60 cells with enforced expression of the bcl-xL (HL-60/Bcl-xL) and/or neomycin resistance gene (HL-60/neo) were exposed to Taxol to examine CDK1-related cell-cycle events and the cyt c-triggered molecular cascade of apoptosis. At various time-intervals after Taxol treatment, immunoblot analyses of cyclin B1 and CDK1 levels were performed. In addition, the in vitro histone H1 kinase activity of immunoprecipitated CDK1 and its tyrosine phosphorylation status (by anti-phosphotyrosine immunoblot analysis) were determined. Data presented here show that, while Taxol-induced peak CDK1 kinase activity occurs earlier in HL-60/neo cells, there are no significant differences in cyclin B1 accumulation, tyrosine dephosphorylation of CDK1, and mitotic arrest of Taxol-treated HL-60/neo vs HL-60/Bcl-xL cells. Taxol-induced CDK1 activation and mitosis preceded the cytosolic accumulation (approximately six-fold) of cyt c. The latter event was blocked by Bcl-xL overexpression but not by inhibitors of caspase-3. Although the caspase inhibitors and high Bcl-xL levels inhibited caspase-3 cleavage and activity, they did not significantly affect Taxol-induced CDK1 activation or mitotic arrest. These findings indicate that Bcl-xL overexpression does not affect Taxol-induced CDK1 activity leading to G2/M transition, which temporally precedes the cytosolic cyt c-mediated cleavage and activity of caspase-3 and apoptosis.","['Ibrado, A M', 'Kim, C N', 'Bhalla, K']","['Ibrado AM', 'Kim CN', 'Bhalla K']","['Department of Medicine, Winship Cancer Center Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, GA 30322, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (BCL2L1 protein, human)', '0 (CCNB1 protein, human)', '0 (Cyclin B)', '0 (Cyclin B1)', '0 (Cytochrome c Group)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (bcl-X Protein)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (CDC2 Protein Kinase)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'P88XT4IS4D (Paclitaxel)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/*pharmacology', '*Apoptosis', 'CDC2 Protein Kinase/*metabolism', 'Caspase 3', 'Caspases/*metabolism', 'Cyclin B/metabolism', 'Cyclin B1', 'Cytochrome c Group/*metabolism', 'Cytosol/metabolism', 'HL-60 Cells/drug effects/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Mitosis/*drug effects/physiology', 'Paclitaxel/*pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'Time Factors', 'bcl-X Protein']",1998/12/09 00:00,1998/12/09 00:01,['1998/12/09 00:00'],"['1998/12/09 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/12/09 00:01 [medline]', '1998/12/09 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2401218 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 1998 Dec;12(12):1930-6. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2401218.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These signals can be initiated after receptor ligation and are transmitted to members of the MAP kinase cascade that subsequently activate transcription factors controlling gene expression. Raf is a member of a multigene family which includes: Raf-1, A-Raf and B-Raf. The roles that individual Raf kinases play in the regulation of normal and malignant hematopoietic cell growth are not clear. The following studies show that all three Raf kinases are functionally present in certain human hematopoietic cells, and their aberrant expression can result in abrogation of cytokine dependency. Cytokine-dependent TF-1 cells were infected with retroviruses encoding amino-terminal deleted (delta) A-Raf, B-Raf and Raf-1 proteins. These Raf proteins were conditionally inducible as they were fused to the hormone-binding domain of the estrogen receptor (ER). A hierarchy in the abilities of Raf-containing retroviruses to abrogate cytokine dependency was observed as deltaA-Raf:ER was 20- to 200-fold more efficient than either deltaRaf-1:ER or deltaB-Raf:ER, respectively. This result was unexpected as A-Raf is an intrinsically weaker kinase than either Raf-1 or B-Raf. The activated Raf proteins induced downstream MEK and MAP (ERK1 and ERK2) kinase activities in the cells which proliferated in response to Raf activation. Furthermore, a functional MEK signaling pathway was necessary as treatment of the cells with a MEK1-inhibitor suppressed Raf-mediated proliferation. To determine whether the regulatory phosphorylation residues contained in the modified Raf oncoproteins were necessary for transformation, they were altered by site-directed mutagenesis. Substitution of the regulatory phosphorylation tyrosine residues with phenylalanine in either A-Raf or Raf-1 reduced the capacity of these oncoproteins to abrogate cytokine dependency. In contrast, changing the critical aspartic acid residues of B-Raf to either tyrosine or phenylalanine increased the frequency of estradiol-responsive cells. Thus, the amino acids present in the regulatory residues modulated the capability of Raf proteins to abrogate the cytokine dependency of TF-1 cells. Differences in the levels of Raf and downstream kinase activities were observed between cytokine-dependent and estradiol-responsive deltaRaf:ER-infected cells as estradiol-responsive cells usually expressed more Raf and MEK activity than GM-CSF-dependent, deltaRaf:ER-infected cells. Abrogation of cytokine dependency by the activated deltaRaf:ER proteins was associated with autocrine growth factor synthesis which was sufficient to promote the growth of uninfected TF-1 cells. In summary, these observations indicate that the aberrant expression of certain activated deltaRaf:ER oncoproteins can alter the cytokine dependency of human hematopoietic TF-1 cells. These cells will be useful in evaluating the roles of the individual Raf oncoproteins in signal transduction, cell cycle progression, autocrine transformation, regulation of apoptosis and differentiation. Moreover, these Raf-infected cells may be important in evaluating the efficacy of novel anticancer drugs designed to inhibit Raf and downstream signal transduction molecules.","['McCubrey, J A', 'Steelman, L S', 'Hoyle, P E', 'Blalock, W L', 'Weinstein-Oppenheimer, C', 'Franklin, R A', 'Cherwinski, H', 'Bosch, E', 'McMahon, M']","['McCubrey JA', 'Steelman LS', 'Hoyle PE', 'Blalock WL', 'Weinstein-Oppenheimer C', 'Franklin RA', 'Cherwinski H', 'Bosch E', 'McMahon M']","['Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Member Leo Jenkins Cancer Center, East Carolina University School of Medicine, Greenville, NC 27858, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Estrogen Antagonists)', '4TI98Z838E (Estradiol)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-raf)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Ribosomal Protein S6 Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.17 (Calcium-Calmodulin-Dependent Protein Kinases)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)', 'YOW8V9698H (Dimethyl Sulfoxide)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/genetics', 'Calcium-Calmodulin-Dependent Protein Kinases/metabolism', 'Cell Division', 'Cell Line', 'DNA Fragmentation', 'Dimethyl Sulfoxide/pharmacology', 'Estradiol/pharmacology', 'Estrogen Antagonists/pharmacology', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/pharmacology', 'HL-60 Cells/metabolism', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/chemistry/drug effects/*physiology/virology', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells/metabolism', 'Mutagenesis, Insertional', 'Phosphorylation', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-raf/*physiology', 'Retroviridae', 'Ribosomal Protein S6 Kinases/metabolism', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology']",1998/12/09 00:00,1998/12/09 00:01,['1998/12/09 00:00'],"['1998/12/09 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/12/09 00:01 [medline]', '1998/12/09 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2401215 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 1998 Dec;12(12):1903-29. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2401215.,['R01CA51025/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

WT1 has been proposed as a marker for minimal residual disease in leukemia. We obtained serial blood or bone marrow samples from patients with de novo AML at diagnosis, during therapy, and up to 95 months after diagnosis and analyzed for WT1 gene expression by RT-PCR to determine whether gene expression was predictive of relapse. Forty-four patients had WT1-positive AML and achieved a complete remission (CR) following chemotherapy and 24 patients underwent unrelated donor (n = 4), sibling donor (n = 13) or autologous (n = 7) marrow transplantation. After achieving CR 62% of the patients became WT1-negative, while 38% remained WT1-positive. There was no difference in the disease-free survival (DFS) and survival from remission between WT1-positive and -negative patients (P > 0.1). Following BMT, 32% of the patients analyzed in CR within the first 100 days after transplantation were WT1 PCR positive. Detection of WT1 transcripts within 100 days following BMT did not affect DFS and overall survival (OS) after transplantation (P > 0.1). Ten of 11 patients who are in continuous CR following chemotherapy or BMT for more than 3 years were transiently WT1-positive during the observation period. Four of these patients displayed the WT1 transcript at the last examination. Thirteen of 39 patients were WT1 PCR negative within 4 months before clinical onset of relapse and eight patients were WT1 PCR negative at time of relapse. These data indicate that: (1) achievement of WT1 negativity is not associated with longer DFS, survival from remission, or OS after transplantation; (2) not all patients who relapse become WT1 positive again; (3) long-term remitters frequently display the WT1 transcript. Thus, we conclude that the monitoring of WT1 gene expression by qualitative RT-PCR during treatment and CR is of very limited value.","['Gaiger, A', 'Schmid, D', 'Heinze, G', 'Linnerth, B', 'Greinix, H', 'Kalhs, P', 'Tisljar, K', 'Priglinger, S', 'Laczika, K', 'Mitterbauer, M', 'Novak, M', 'Mitterbauer, G', 'Mannhalter, C', 'Haas, O A', 'Lechner, K', 'Jager, U']","['Gaiger A', 'Schmid D', 'Heinze G', 'Linnerth B', 'Greinix H', 'Kalhs P', 'Tisljar K', 'Priglinger S', 'Laczika K', 'Mitterbauer M', 'Novak M', 'Mitterbauer G', 'Mannhalter C', 'Haas OA', 'Lechner K', 'Jager U']","['First Department of Medicine, University of Vienna, Austria.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (WT1 Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*analysis', 'Female', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/analysis', 'Gene Expression', '*Genes, Wilms Tumor', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*genetics/metabolism/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Prognosis', 'Recurrence', 'Remission Induction', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Transcription Factors/*analysis', 'WT1 Proteins']",1998/12/09 00:00,1998/12/09 00:01,['1998/12/09 00:00'],"['1998/12/09 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/12/09 00:01 [medline]', '1998/12/09 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2401213 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 1998 Dec;12(12):1886-94. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2401213.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The first part of the meeting was dedicated to relevant aspects of laboratory research, and included the following topics: molecular mechanisms of leukemogenesis and of response/resistance to retinoids, biologic and therapeutic effects of new agents such as arsenicals and novel synthetic retinoids; characterization of APL heterogeneity at the morphological, cytogenetic and immunophenotypic level. The updated results of large cooperative clinical trials using variable combinations of all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) and chemotherapy were presented by the respective group chairmen, and formed the 'core' part of the meeting. These studies, which in most cases integrated the molecular assessment of response to treatment, provided a stimulating framework for an intense debate on the most appropriate frontline treatment options to be adopted in the future. The last day was dedicated to special entities such as APL in the elderly and in the child, as well as the role of bone marrow transplantation. The prognostic value of molecular monitoring studies was also discussed in the final session of the meeting. In this article, we review the major advances and controversial issues in APL biology and treatment discussed in this symposium and emerging from very recent publications.

The strategy was developed further towards a generally applicable expression cloning system to identify signal transducers in tyrosine kinase pathways. This system is based on the ability of downstream acting genes to rescue the transformation phenotype of partial loss-of-function mutants of BCR-ABL which still retain tyrosine kinase activity. Using this strategy we have previously shown that overexpression of c-Myc and Cyclin D1 can rescue a signaling defective SH2 mutant of BCR-ABL for transformation. In an unbiased approach to identify new compensating genes, a cDNA library was introduced by retroviral infection into fibroblasts which express the BCR-ABL SH2 mutant. CDNA clones, capable of rescuing the SH2 mutant for transformation should result in colony formation in soft agar. A PCR approach was used to recover these compensating genes from the genomic DNA of the transformed fibroblasts. Sequencing analysis of the initial cDNAs identified three known genes, the adapter molecule Shc, the kinases SPRK and p38 MAPK. These genes have been found to interact functionally with BCR-ABL for fibroblast and hematopoietic cell transformation. Currently, we are constructing and screening new libraries to identify novel genes which complement the BCR-ABL SH2 mutant. Our results demonstrate that this cloning approach is an effective means of identifying and characterizing signaling molecules that function in specific signaling pathways. This in turn may identify specific targets for mechanism-based therapeutic intervention to block altered signaling.","['Mahlmann, S', 'McLaughlin, J', 'Afar, D E', 'Mohr, R', 'Kay, R J', 'Witte, O N']","['Mahlmann S', 'McLaughlin J', 'Afar DE', 'Mohr R', 'Kay RJ', 'Witte ON']","['Basel Institute for Immunology, Switzerland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (Adaptor Proteins, Vesicular Transport)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (Shc Signaling Adaptor Proteins)', '0 (Shc1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Src Homology 2 Domain-Containing, Transforming Protein 1)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.17 (Calcium-Calmodulin-Dependent Protein Kinases)']",IM,"['*Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing', '*Adaptor Proteins, Vesicular Transport', 'Animals', 'Biological Assay', 'Caenorhabditis elegans', 'Calcium-Calmodulin-Dependent Protein Kinases/genetics/physiology', 'Cell Transformation, Viral/genetics', 'Drosophila melanogaster', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*genetics/physiology', 'Mice', 'Oncogenes/physiology', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/genetics/physiology', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*physiology', 'Proteins/genetics/physiology', 'Retroviridae/genetics', 'Shc Signaling Adaptor Proteins', 'Signal Transduction/*genetics', 'Src Homology 2 Domain-Containing, Transforming Protein 1']",1998/12/09 00:00,1998/12/09 00:01,['1998/12/09 00:00'],"['1998/12/09 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/12/09 00:01 [medline]', '1998/12/09 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2401231 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 1998 Dec;12(12):1858-65. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2401231.,,,,77,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this family, the central SH2 domain and C-terminal (about 40 amino acids) (CIS homology domain; CH domain) are well conserved, while N-terminal region shares little similarity and varies in length. Most of them appear to be induced after stimulation with several different cytokines and at least three of them (CIS1, CIS3 and JAB) negatively regulate cytokine signal transduction by various means. Forced expression of CIS1 inhibits STAT5 activation by binding to cytokine receptors, whereas CIS3 and JAB directly binds to the kinase domain of JAKs, thereby inhibiting tyrosine kinase activity. Therefore, these CIS family members seem to function in a classical negative feedback loop of cytokine signaling. They may also be involved in suppression between cytokines frequently found in immune and inflammatory responses. JAB is found to inhibit interferon signaling, suggesting that elevated expression of JAB is involved in interferon-resistance. The mechanisms by which these inhibitors of cytokine signal transduction exert their effects and their physiological functions are crucial issues which need to be and will be addressed in the near future.","['Yoshimura, A']",['Yoshimura A'],"['Institute of Life Science, Kurume University, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Immediate-Early Proteins)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (SOCS1 protein, human)', '0 (Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling 1 Protein)', '0 (Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling Proteins)', '0 (cytokine inducible SH2-containing protein)', '9008-11-1 (Interferons)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Carrier Proteins/metabolism', 'Drug Resistance', 'Immediate-Early Proteins/chemistry/*physiology', 'Interferons/pharmacology', '*Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*physiology', '*Repressor Proteins', 'Signal Transduction/*physiology', 'Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling 1 Protein', 'Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling Proteins', 'Terminology as Topic']",1998/12/09 00:00,1998/12/09 00:01,['1998/12/09 00:00'],"['1998/12/09 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/12/09 00:01 [medline]', '1998/12/09 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2401238 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 1998 Dec;12(12):1851-7. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2401238.,,,,47,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These pathways have been linked to the regulation of many diverse cellular events such as proliferation, senescence, differentiation and apoptosis. This review will focus upon the many roles of signaling by the p42/p44 mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase pathway. Recent evidence suggests that signaling by the MAP kinase pathway can both enhance proliferation by increased expression of molecules such as cyclin D1, but also cause growth arrest by increased expression of molecules such as the cyclin kinase inhibitor protein p21(Cip-1/MDA6/WAF1). These differential effects on growth have been correlated to the amplitude and duration of the MAP kinase activity signal. Furthermore several laboratories are reporting data suggesting that inhibition of the MAP kinase pathway, as well as a family of upstream MAP kinase activators, the protein kinase C family, represent an important route to both radio- and chemo-sensitization of tumor cells. Herein, we describe the historical discovery and characterization of the MAP kinase pathway.

These cells appear to become resistant to apoptosis following growth factor withdraw. We demonstrate that despite this property, Bcr-Abl transformed cells (primitive hematopoietic progenitors or cell lines) remains sensitive to apoptosis induced by Ceramides analogues. This effect is dose dependent and occurs faster in transformed cells as compared to their normal counterparts. In addition to the classical features of apoptosis, we observed that Ceramide-treated CML cells display a rapid and sequential activation of the Bcr-Abl and PI3 kinases. We then demonstrated the role of the Bcr-Abl kinase activity in the accelerated response observed in CML cells treated by Ceramide. The PI3 kinase seems to be partly involved in the accelerated Phosphatidyl-Serine exposure observed in Bcr-Abl transformed cells. Finally, we observed that Ceramide-induced apoptosis does not seem to implicate a Bcl2 protein modulation. Taken together these results support the hypothesis of at least two independent signaling pathways initiating programmed cell death: one will be involved in apoptosis mediated by signals such as cytokine-starving is blocked by the Bcr-Abl fusion protein while the other one initiated by Ceramide is accelerated by the Bcr-Abl protein.","['Maguer-Satta, V']",['Maguer-Satta V'],"['Inserm U453, Groupe Hematopoiese, Centre Leon Berard, Lyon, France.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],France,Hematol Cell Ther,Hematology and cell therapy,9613253,"['0 (Ceramides)', '0 (Growth Substances)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'Ceramides/*therapeutic use', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/physiology', 'Growth Substances/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/physiology', 'Signal Transduction/*drug effects']",1998/12/09 00:00,1998/12/09 00:01,['1998/12/09 00:00'],"['1998/12/09 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/12/09 00:01 [medline]', '1998/12/09 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Hematol Cell Ther. 1998 Oct;40(5):233-6.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

RT-PCR is by far the most sensitive assay to detect residual disease in CML and can enable a single leukaemia cell to be detected in a background of 10(5)-10(6) normal cells. This is approximately 1000 x greater than the routine detection limit of the other methods. After allogeneic BMT, many CML patients are BCR-ABL positive for prolonged periods of time without subsequently relapsing. Thus the simple presence or absence of residual BCR-ABL transcripts in patients' leukocytes is of little value in the management of individual cases. Quantitative PCR techniques can distinguish between those PCR positive patients who have low or falling BCR-ABL levels on sequential analysis from those who have levels that are increasing. Provided assays are performed frequently enough, rising or persistently high numbers of BCR-ABL transcripts can be detected prior to frank relapse and this information may be used for early therapeutic intervention. Most patients who respond to treatment for relapse by donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI) achieve durable molecular remission. Quantitative PCR is also useful to gauge the response of CML patients to IFN-alpha. We have found that the great majority of patients in complete cytogenetic remission after treatment with IFN-alpha remain PCR positive and harbour a minority population of BCR-ABL positive myeloid precursor cells. It is unlikely therefore this treatment modality completely eliminates the disease in any patient.","['Cross, N C']",['Cross NC'],"['Department of Haematology, Imperial College School of Medicine, Hammersmith Hospital, London, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",France,Hematol Cell Ther,Hematology and cell therapy,9613253,"['0 (RNA, Messenger)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/diagnosis/*therapy', 'Neoplasm, Residual/diagnosis/*therapy', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Remission Induction', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",1998/12/09 00:00,1998/12/09 00:01,['1998/12/09 00:00'],"['1998/12/09 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/12/09 00:01 [medline]', '1998/12/09 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Hematol Cell Ther. 1998 Oct;40(5):224-8.,,,,22,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Deletion and site-directed mutagenesis experiments have determined the critical regions of the oncogene for its interaction with major signalling pathways but the roles of the latter in the resulting leukemic phenotypes are not well understood. Several major signalling pathways shown to be activated by BCR-ABL, including RAS, MYC, JUN, STAT, PI-3K and NF-KB are briefly discussed in this paper. Other signalling molecules are also clearly involved, including p62-DOK, p95-VAV, CRK-L, p12O-CBL and focal adhesion proteins. Recent experimental evidence also indicates that negative regulatory proteins could be activated in cells expressing BCR-ABL and their inhibition during the course of the disease could play a role in the progression towards the acute phase. We finally discuss the evidence indicating that at least in experimental systems BCR-ABL has a clear anti-apoptotic activity and that BCR-ABL achieves this effect by acting upstream of the procaspase-3.","['Turhan, A G', 'Solary, E', 'Vainchenker, W', 'Dusanter-Fourt, I']","['Turhan AG', 'Solary E', 'Vainchenker W', 'Dusanter-Fourt I']","['Translational Research-Cell Therapy Laboratory-INSERM U362, Institut Gustave Roussy, Villejuif, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",France,Hematol Cell Ther,Hematology and cell therapy,9613253,"['EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*physiopathology/therapy', 'Signal Transduction/physiology', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",1998/12/09 00:00,1998/12/09 00:01,['1998/12/09 00:00'],"['1998/12/09 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/12/09 00:01 [medline]', '1998/12/09 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Hematol Cell Ther. 1998 Oct;40(5):217-21.,,,,41,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this paper, abnormalities of the TP53 gene were investigated in two cases of prolymphocytic leukemia, one with t(11;14)(q13;q32), evolving from atypical CLL (patient 1), and one presenting as a de novo condition (patient 2). TP53 DNA was investigated by Southern blot and PCR-SSCP analysis, and TP53 expression was investigated by Northern blot analysis and immunocytochemistry. C-MYC and BCL-1/PRAD1 gene expression were also investigated. Restriction enzyme analysis of TP53 DNA in patient 1 showed alteration of fragments including exon I and intron I, and, in both patients, a specific loss of TP53 DNA. In patient 2, PCR direct sequencing showed in exon VII a 9 bp deletion including codons 252-254. In patient 1, TP53 RNA and protein were not found, indicating that the unusual 5' rearrangement has affected TP53 gene expression. By contrast, patient 2 exhibited detectable TP53 RNA and protein. Detectable but weak BCL-1/PRAD1 RNA was present in both patients, whereas C-MYC RNA expression was clearly present only in case 1. The presence of TP53 hemizygous mutations in both patients suggests that TP53 abnormalities may be important in the pathogenesis of prolymphocytic leukemia (PLL), and may possibly account for the frequent resistance to therapy observed in this disease.","['De Angeli, C', 'Cuneo, A', 'Aguiari, G', 'Roberti, M G', 'Piva, N', 'Moretti, S', 'Cavazzini, P', 'Castoldi, G', 'del Senno, L']","['De Angeli C', 'Cuneo A', 'Aguiari G', 'Roberti MG', 'Piva N', 'Moretti S', 'Cavazzini P', 'Castoldi G', 'del Senno L']","['Centro Interdipartimentale di Biotecnologie-Sezione di Studi Biochimici delle Patologie del Genoma Umano, Universita degli Studi, Ferrara, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Genet Cytogenet,Cancer genetics and cytogenetics,7909240,"['0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Exons/genetics', 'Female', 'Genes, p53/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/drug therapy/*genetics/pathology', 'Leukemia, Prolymphocytic/drug therapy/*genetics/pathology', 'Male', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/analysis']",1998/12/09 00:00,1998/12/09 00:01,['1998/12/09 00:00'],"['1998/12/09 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/12/09 00:01 [medline]', '1998/12/09 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0165460898001010 [pii]', '10.1016/s0165-4608(98)00101-0 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Genet Cytogenet. 1998 Dec;107(2):137-43. doi: 10.1016/s0165-4608(98)00101-0.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

CD14 is the monocyte-associated antigen most widely used to identify AML with monocytic differentiation (French-American-British classes M4 and M5); however, we observed that CD14 expression is frequently diminished or absent in such cases. To identify monocyte-associated antigens that might improve recognition of AML M4 and M5, we used 3-color flow cytometry and a panel of antibodies reported to distinguish cells of monocytic lineage in 44 cases of AML. In addition, CD45 vs logarithmic side scatter plots were analyzed in all cases. As expected, CD14 was highly specific but was only moderately sensitive for monocytic differentiation. CD64 had the best-combined sensitivity and specificity for AML M4 and M5. CD45 vs logarithmic side scatter analysis showed a higher percentage of monocytes in AML M4 and M5 compared with nonmonocytic AML. CD64 was expressed in 5 of 5 cases of acute promyelocytic leukemia (AML M3), but the intensity of staining was significantly less in AML M3 than in AML M4 and M5. Our findings show that addition of CD64 and CD45 vs logarithmic side scatter analysis to CD14 greatly improves flow cytometric detection of AML with monocytic differentiation and that CD64, also expressed in AML M3, may help distinguish AML M3 from other subtypes.","['Krasinskas, A M', 'Wasik, M A', 'Kamoun, M', 'Schretzenmair, R', 'Moore, J', 'Salhany, K E']","['Krasinskas AM', 'Wasik MA', 'Kamoun M', 'Schretzenmair R', 'Moore J', 'Salhany KE']","['Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, University of Pennsylvania Medical Center, Philadelphia 19104-4283, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Am J Clin Pathol,American journal of clinical pathology,0370470,"['0 (Receptors, IgG)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Leukocyte Common Antigens)']",IM,"['Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/blood/*classification/*pathology', 'Leukocyte Common Antigens/*analysis', 'Receptors, IgG/*analysis', 'Sensitivity and Specificity']",1998/12/09 00:00,1998/12/09 00:01,['1998/12/09 00:00'],"['1998/12/09 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/12/09 00:01 [medline]', '1998/12/09 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/ajcp/110.6.797 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Clin Pathol. 1998 Dec;110(6):797-805. doi: 10.1093/ajcp/110.6.797.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

From this background, we tried to search for clinical characteristics of double cancers associated with RCC. PATIENTS: The eight hundred and four patients with RCC have been treated at our University Hospitals and affiliated hospitals, and of them, the 38 patients (male in 25, female in 13) had double cancers during the clinical course, and these patients were objective in our study. RESULTS: 1) When we looked at all patients, there observed gastric cancer most frequently in 14 (36.8%), lung cancer in 3 (7.9%), prostate cancer in 3, bladder cancer in 3, uterine cancer in 3, rectal cancer in 2 (5.3%), thyroid cancer in 2, and pharynx, esophagus, T-cell lymphoma, chronic lymphatic leukaemia (CLL), renal pelvis, sigmoid colon, brain and colon cancers in 1 (2.6%) respectively. 2) As to the male patients, there observed 10 gastric cancers, of them, 2 died of this disease (20%), 3 lung cancers, of them, 2 died of this disease (66.7%), 3 prostate cancers, of them, 2 died of this disease (66.7%), 3 bladder cancers, of them, 1 died of this disease (33.3%), and 1 cancer patient with pharynx died of this disease, esophagus, T-cell lymphoma, CLL, renal pelvis and sigmoid colon died of this disease. Regarding the female patients, there observed 4 gastric cancers, all of them died of this disease, 3 uterine cancers, all of them died of this disease, 2 rectum cancers, all of them died of this disease, 2 thyroid cancers, of them, 1 died of this disease, 1 brain cancer and 1 rectal cancer. Furthermore, as to the timing at the detection of double cancers during the clinical course, the 10 patients (40%) detected double cancers simultaneously in male patients. On the other hand, no patient with double cancers was detected simultaneously in female patients. CONCLUSION: The gastric cancer is most frequently observed as double cancer in both of male and female patients with RCC. But, in the female patients, it shows more frequently died of double cancers associated with RCC compared with those in male. Furthermore, as to the timing at the detection of double cancer is asynchronous in all female patients with RCC.","['Onishi, T', 'Ohishi, Y', 'Suzuki, H', 'Asano, K', 'Hatano, T', 'Nakajo, H', 'Hosobe, T', 'Tomita, M', 'Abe, K']","['Onishi T', 'Ohishi Y', 'Suzuki H', 'Asano K', 'Hatano T', 'Nakajo H', 'Hosobe T', 'Tomita M', 'Abe K']","['Department of Urology, Jikei University School of Medicine.']",['jpn'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Japan,Nihon Hinyokika Gakkai Zasshi,Nihon Hinyokika Gakkai zasshi.

There has been a fundamental change in the prevailing periodontal disease model of the 1960s, which suggested that the susceptibility to periodontitis increases with age, and that all individuals are susceptible to severe periodontal disease. More recent research has changed the belief in universal susceptibility to the current view that only some 5-20% of any population suffer from severe generalized periodontitis, and that only moderate disease affects a majority of adults. One major risk factor is smoking, as there is now a clear association between smoking and periodontal disease independent of oral hygiene, age, or any other risk factor. In human periodontitis, there is no simple, direct pathogen-disease link. There are three pathogens that have a strong association with progressive periodontal disease: Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, spirochetes of acute necrotizing gingivitis, and Porphyromonas gingivalis. These pathogens may be the cause of continued loss of periodontal attachment in all periodontal disease classifications despite diligent periodontal therapy. This loss of attachment, or destruction of the periodontal ligament and loss of adjacent supporting bone, is seen in adult periodontitis, as well as in early-onset periodontitis, which affects young persons who otherwise appear healthy. The three forms of early-onset periodontitis are prepubertal periodontitis, localized and generalized juvenile periodontitis, and rapidly progressive periodontitis. They are distinguished from adult periodontitis by the age of onset of the disease, the rapid rate of disease progression, manifestations of defects in host response, and the composition of the subgingival microflora. Prepubertal periodontitis is associated with attachment loss around teeth of the deciduous and/or permanent dentition, and is often associated with severe congenital defects of hematological origin, and alterations in neutrophil chemotaxis function. Periodontitis may also be associated with systemic conditions such as metabolic disorders (diabetes mellitus, female hormonal alterations), drug-induced disorders, hematologic disorders/leukemia, and immune system disorders. These systemic disorders have been documented as capable of affecting the periodontium and/or treatment of periodontal disease. In order to rationally treat and prevent periodontal disease, we need to know the etiologic agents for specific patients, and the mechanism of bacterial pathogenesis in periodontitis. In systemic diseases in which the periodontal tissues are affected as well, early detection and carefully managed therapeutics with the physician and periodontist working together may prove beneficial to the patient's general health and quality of life.","['Fenesy, K E']",['Fenesy KE'],"['Department of Oral Pathology, Biology and Diagnostic Sciences, New Jersey Dental School, University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey, Newark 07103-2400, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Mt Sinai J Med,"The Mount Sinai journal of medicine, New York",0241032,,IM,"['Adult', 'Age of Onset', 'Child', 'Drug-Related Side Effects and Adverse Reactions', 'Female', 'Hematologic Diseases/complications', 'Humans', 'Metabolic Diseases/complications', '*Periodontitis/diagnosis/etiology/therapy', 'Risk Factors']",1998/12/09 00:00,1998/12/09 00:01,['1998/12/09 00:00'],"['1998/12/09 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/12/09 00:01 [medline]', '1998/12/09 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Mt Sinai J Med. 1998 Oct-Nov;65(5-6):362-9.,,,,50,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To investigate this further, we examined the expression of c-Src, its kinase family members, and their putative substrates in the human leukemia cell line FLG 29.1. Western blot analysis with specific antibodies against Src family members showed expression of Src, Fyn, and Lyn, lower levels of Yes and Hck, and the absence of Lck tyrosine kinase. During a 3-day treatment with phorbol 12-myristate, 13-acetate (PMA), which induces differentiation of FLG 29.1 cells toward an osteoclast-like phenotype, the levels of Src and Fyn increased and the levels of Lyn decreased. In a similar leukemia cell line, HL-60, Src protein was not constitutively expressed and not induced by PMA treatment, which leads to monocytic differentiation. PMA treatment of FLG 29.1 cells induced a strong increase in the expression of p120 Cbl and Pyk2 kinase, which are putative Src substrates. Pyk2 phosphorylation increased upon adherence of FLG 29.1 cells to fibronectin and to ST2 stromal cells. The expression of other Src substrates and interacting proteins, such as p120 Cas, p130 Cas, vinculin, Fak kinase, and the p85 phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase subunit either did not change or slightly increased during PMA treatment. The elevated total protein tyrosine phosphorylation in PMA-treated FLG 29.1 cells was abolished by herbimycin A, a Src inhibitor. These data are consistent with the proposed role of Src in the osteoclastic function and support the use of FLG 29.1 cells as a model to study Src substrates in the cells of the osteoclastic lineage.","['Jeschke, M', 'Brandi, M L', 'Susa, M']","['Jeschke M', 'Brandi ML', 'Susa M']","['Novartis Pharma AG, Research Bone Metabolism, Basel, Switzerland.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Bone Miner Res,Journal of bone and mineral research : the official journal of the American Society for Bone and Mineral Research,8610640,"['0 (BCAR1 protein, human)', '0 (Catenins)', '0 (Cell Adhesion Molecules)', '0 (Crk-Associated Substrate Protein)', '0 (FLG protein, human)', '0 (Filaggrin Proteins)', '0 (Phosphoproteins)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (Retinoblastoma-Like Protein p130)', '0 (delta catenin)', '125361-02-6 (Vinculin)', '42HK56048U (Tyrosine)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (CSK Tyrosine-Protein Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Focal Adhesion Kinase 1)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Focal Adhesion Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (PTK2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (src-Family Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.23 (CSK protein, human)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Blotting, Western', 'CSK Tyrosine-Protein Kinase', 'Catenins', 'Cell Adhesion/drug effects', 'Cell Adhesion Molecules/metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Crk-Associated Substrate Protein', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'Filaggrin Proteins', 'Focal Adhesion Kinase 1', 'Focal Adhesion Protein-Tyrosine Kinases', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Osteoclasts/drug effects/*enzymology', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/metabolism', 'Phosphoproteins/metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*biosynthesis/metabolism', '*Proteins', 'Retinoblastoma-Like Protein p130', 'Stem Cells/drug effects/*enzymology', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tyrosine/metabolism', 'Vinculin/metabolism', 'src-Family Kinases']",1998/12/09 00:00,1998/12/09 00:01,['1998/12/09 00:00'],"['1998/12/09 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/12/09 00:01 [medline]', '1998/12/09 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1359/jbmr.1998.13.12.1880 [doi]'],ppublish,J Bone Miner Res. 1998 Dec;13(12):1880-9. doi: 10.1359/jbmr.1998.13.12.1880.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

They were introduced either into MCA205 murine tumor cells, which do not proliferate upon s.c. injection into an allogeneic host, or into CL8.1 murine tumor cells, which overexpress class I antigens and are rejected in a syngeneic host. In both cases, expression of the complete envelope protein or of the transmembrane subunit resulted in tumor growth in vivo, with no effect of control vectors. Tumor cell growth results from inhibition of the host immune response, as the envelope-dependent effect was no more observed for MCA205 cells in syngeneic mice or for CL8.1 cells in x-irradiated mice. This inhibition is local because it is not observed at the level of control tumor cells injected contralaterally.

METHOD: The radiology reports of 203 consecutive patients with cancer or chronic hematologic disorders who underwent splenectomy between January 1990 and January 1997 were reviewed. Imaging examinations and medical records were reviewed for those in whom PST was found after splenectomy. RESULTS: One hundred twenty-three patients (60.6%) underwent CT (n = 88), sonography (n = 10), or both (n = 24) after splenectomy; one other patient underwent MRI. Twelve of these patients (9.8%) had thrombosis of the splenic, portal, and/or superior mesenteric veins. Their underlying diseases were myelofibrosis/ myelodysplastic syndrome (n = 8), lymphoma (n = 3), and leukemia (n = 1). At follow-up imaging (obtained in 10 of the 12 patients), PST had resolved (n = 5), worsened (n = 2), improved (n = 1), remained unchanged (n = 1), or resulted in cavernous transformation of the portal vein (n = 1). Nine of 12 patients were symptomatic. No patient died of PST. CONCLUSION: PST was an uncommon and typically unsuspected finding after splenectomy in this patient population, and no serious sequelae of PST were found. Routine surveillance imaging for PST after splenectomy does not seem warranted, but in symptomatic patients (particularly those with myelofibrosis/myelodysplastic syndrome), a high clinical suspicion and a low threshold for obtaining imaging examinations are needed.","['Loring, L A', 'Panicek, D M', 'Karpeh, M S']","['Loring LA', 'Panicek DM', 'Karpeh MS']","['Department of Radiology, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, and Cornell University Medical College, New York, NY 10021, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Comput Assist Tomogr,Journal of computer assisted tomography,7703942,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Female', 'Hematologic Diseases/surgery', 'Humans', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms/surgery', '*Portal System/diagnostic imaging/pathology', 'Postoperative Complications/*diagnosis/diagnostic imaging/epidemiology', '*Splenectomy', 'Tomography, X-Ray Computed', 'Ultrasonography', 'Venous Thrombosis/*diagnosis/diagnostic imaging/etiology']",1998/12/08 00:00,1998/12/08 00:01,['1998/12/08 00:00'],"['1998/12/08 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/12/08 00:01 [medline]', '1998/12/08 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/00004728-199811000-00003 [doi]'],ppublish,J Comput Assist Tomogr. 1998 Nov-Dec;22(6):856-60. doi: 10.1097/00004728-199811000-00003.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To investigate the role of cyclin A1 and possible redundancy among the cyclins in vivo, we generated mice bearing a null mutation of Ccna1. Ccna1-/- males were sterile due to a block of spermatogenesis before the first meiotic division, whereas females were normal. Meiosis arrest in Ccna1-/- males was associated with increased germ cell apoptosis, desynapsis abnormalities and reduction of Cdc2 kinase activation at the end of meiotic prophase. Cyclin A1 is therefore essential for spermatocyte passage into the first meiotic division in male mice, a function that cannot be complemented by the concurrently expressed B-type cyclins.","['Liu, D', 'Matzuk, M M', 'Sung, W K', 'Guo, Q', 'Wang, P', 'Wolgemuth, D J']","['Liu D', 'Matzuk MM', 'Sung WK', 'Guo Q', 'Wang P', 'Wolgemuth DJ']","['Integrated Program in Cellular, Molecular and Biophysical Studies, Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, New York 10032, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Nat Genet,Nature genetics,9216904,"['0 (Ccna1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Cyclin A)', '0 (Cyclin A1)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (CDC2-CDC28 Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (Cdk2 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 2)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinases)']",IM,"['Animals', '*CDC2-CDC28 Kinases', 'Cyclin A/genetics/*physiology', 'Cyclin A1', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 2', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Female', 'Male', 'Meiosis/*physiology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Phenotype', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Spermatogenesis/genetics']",1998/12/08 03:03,2001/03/23 10:01,['1998/12/08 03:03'],"['1998/12/08 03:03 [pubmed]', '2001/03/23 10:01 [medline]', '1998/12/08 03:03 [entrez]']",['10.1038/3855 [doi]'],ppublish,Nat Genet. 1998 Dec;20(4):377-80. doi: 10.1038/3855.,,,,,,,,,,,,,['NASA'],['Non-programmatic'],,,,,,

All five patients overexpressing MDM2 belonged to a group with unfavorable prognostic signs at diagnosis and three of them relapsed or died within 6 months after diagnosis.","['Gustafsson, B', 'Stal, O', 'Gustafsson, B']","['Gustafsson B', 'Stal O', 'Gustafsson B']","['Department of Paediatrics, Huddinge Hospital, Karolinska Institute, Huddinge, Sweden. leif.gustafsson@mbox301.swipnet.se']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Pediatr Hematol Oncol,Pediatric hematology and oncology,8700164,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (MDM2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-mdm2)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', '*Biomarkers, Tumor', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Mutation', 'Neoplasm Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics', '*Nuclear Proteins', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics/metabolism/physiopathology', 'Prognosis', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-mdm2', 'Recurrence', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/biosynthesis/*genetics']",1998/12/08 00:00,1998/12/08 00:01,['1998/12/08 00:00'],"['1998/12/08 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/12/08 00:01 [medline]', '1998/12/08 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.3109/08880019809018313 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Hematol Oncol. 1998 Nov-Dec;15(6):519-26. doi: 10.3109/08880019809018313.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: A variety of meta-analytic statistical methods were applied to all available studies combined and on sub-groups of studies chosen by exposure characteristics. Sample sizes and fail-safe n's were calculated to determine the robustness of results and the potential role of publication bias. RESULTS: Most studies show elevated but not statistically significant odds ratios. Results for exposures assessed by wire codes, distance, and/or historically reconstructed fields are relatively consistent, homogeneous, and positive, while those for direct magnetic field measurements are consistent, homogeneous, and marginally protective. Several unpublished studies, or a single unpublished study with several hundred subjects, would be needed to nullify the observed data. CONCLUSIONS: The observed results identify a consistent risk that cannot be explained by random variation. The data supporting magnetic fields as the principal risk factor are suggestive but inconsistent. Additional studies using innovative designs that focus on highly exposed children offer the most hope of untangling this issue.","['Wartenberg, D']",['Wartenberg D'],"['Department of Environmental and Community Medicine, University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey-Robert Wood Johnson Medical School, Piscataway, USA. dew@eohsi.rutgers.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Meta-Analysis', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Am J Public Health,American journal of public health,1254074,,IM,"['Bias', 'Child', 'Confounding Factors, Epidemiologic', 'Effect Modifier, Epidemiologic', 'Electromagnetic Fields/*adverse effects', 'Environmental Exposure/*adverse effects/analysis', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Radiation-Induced/epidemiology/*etiology', 'Male', 'Odds Ratio', 'Population Surveillance', 'Research Design/standards', '*Residence Characteristics', 'Risk Factors']",1998/12/08 00:00,1998/12/08 00:01,['1998/12/08 00:00'],"['1998/12/08 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/12/08 00:01 [medline]', '1998/12/08 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.2105/ajph.88.12.1787 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Public Health. 1998 Dec;88(12):1787-94. doi: 10.2105/ajph.88.12.1787.,['ES05022/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States'],,PMC1509032,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS: Forty-four patients, residents of the Ashanti region of Ghana that is hyperendemic for Plasmodium falciparum malaria, were studied. All patients had splenomegaly greater than 10 cm. They were given proguanil 100 mg/day for a minimum of 6 months. Lymphocyte surface phenotypes were studied on the peripheral blood smears, immunoglobulin gene rearrangement by the Southern blot technique, serum IgM concentration using the Nor-Partigen-IgM kit, and serum paraprotein concentration by electrophoresis. RESULTS: Based on the response to proguanil, the patients were categorized into good respondents, partial respondents, and non respondents. Peripheral blood lymphocytes exceeded 30% in 19, and villous lymphocytes were less than 30% in 25 patients. CONCLUSION: Splenic lymphoma with villous lymphocytes may be difficult to differentiate from the African variant of chronic lymphocytic leukemia which is associated with splenomegaly and from hyperreactive malarial splenomegaly with lymphocytosis. In West Africa, a peripheral blood lymphocyte count greater than 10 x 109/L, with more than 30% of villous lymphocytes and failure of splenic regression with anti-malarial therapy suggest a diagnosis of splenic lymphoma with villous lymphocytes.","['Bedu-Addo, G', 'Rutheford, T', 'Bevan, D', 'Bates, I']","['Bedu-Addo G', 'Rutheford T', 'Bevan D', 'Bates I']","['Komfo Anokye Teaching Hospital, P.O.

Here we report that Delta7-PGA1 methyl ester, a synthetic anti-cancer PG, increased the level of mRNA for the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21 in human leukaemia HL-60 cells. The induction of p21 was associated with the accumulation of hypophosphorylated retinoblastoma protein (pRB) and the suppression of c-myc gene expression. Since the p53 gene is deleted in HL-60 cells, the anti-cancer PG is suggested to inhibit cancer cell growth by inducing p21 via a p53-independent pathway. Unlike HL-60 cells, cisplatin-resistant HL-60/R-CP cells were insensitive to Delta7-PGA1 methyl ester. While c-myc expression was transiently suppressed, neither G1 arrest nor hypophosphorylation of pRB was observed with the anti-cancer PG. Plasma membrane vesicles from HL-60/R-CP cells showed an enhanced level of GS-X pump (ATP-dependent glutathione S-conjugate export pump) activity towards the glutathione S-conjugate of Delta7-PGA1 methyl ester (Km 110 nM). GIF-0019 inverted question markN-carbomethoxy-S-[5-(4-benzoylphenyl)pentyl]glutathione dimethyl ester inverted question mark, a specific inhibitor of the GS-X pump, dose-dependently enhanced the cellular sensitivity of HL-60/R-CP cells to Delta7-PGA1 methyl ester and induced G1 arrest.

Duodenal mucosal biopsies from iron overloaded patients with genetic haemochromatosis (GH) have increased ferric reductase activity and iron absorption compared with controls, yet the GH mucosa is iron deficient. A similar GH-related iron deficiency is also seen in macrophages. The aim of this study was to investigate whether macrophage ferric reductase activity is altered in GH, and to determine ferric reductase activity in monocytes and differentiated macrophages. The erythroleukaemic K562 cell line was studied as a clonal reference cell line. The basal K562 ferric reductase activity is characteristic of a membrane bound enzyme, being both temperature and protease sensitive. Ferric reductase activity was also demonstrated in human leucocyte, monocyte and macrophage preparations. Assays of K562 and macrophage cell supernatants confirmed that the ferric reductase activity was not due to a secreted factor. Assay of ferric reductase in normalized-iron and iron-enriched (100 microM ferric citrate) conditions showed no significant difference between Cys282Tyr (Cys282-->Tyr) homozygous GH macrophages and Cys282-Tyr negative control activities (P>0.05). However, a 900% increase in ferric reductase activity was observed during monocyte to macrophage differentiation (P<0.05), possibly reflecting the co-ordinate up-regulation of iron metabolism in these cells. The demonstration of approx. 25% activity after macrophage differentiation at high free-iron concentrations compared with 'normalized' iron is consistent with repression of human ferric reductase activity by iron. The identification of the human ferric reductase gene and its protein will ultimately provide insight into its regulation and role in mammalian iron metabolism.","['Partridge, J', 'Wallace, D F', 'Raja, K B', 'Dooley, J S', 'Walker, A P']","['Partridge J', 'Wallace DF', 'Raja KB', 'Dooley JS', 'Walker AP']","['Department of Medicine, Royal Free and University College Medical School, Royal Free Campus, Rowland Hill Street, London NW3 2PF, U.K.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Biochem J,The Biochemical journal,2984726R,"['E1UOL152H7 (Iron)', 'EC 1.5.1.38 (FMN Reductase)', 'EC 1.6.- (NADH, NADPH Oxidoreductases)', 'EC 1.6.99.- (ferric citrate iron reductase)']",IM,"['Cell Differentiation', 'Cells, Cultured', '*FMN Reductase', 'Hemochromatosis/enzymology', 'Humans', 'Iron/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/enzymology', 'Macrophages/*enzymology', 'Male', 'Monocytes/*enzymology', 'NADH, NADPH Oxidoreductases/*antagonists & inhibitors']",1998/12/08 00:00,1998/12/08 00:01,['1998/12/08 00:00'],"['1998/12/08 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/12/08 00:01 [medline]', '1998/12/08 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1042/bj3360541 [doi]'],ppublish,Biochem J. 1998 Dec 15;336 ( Pt 3):541-3. doi: 10.1042/bj3360541.,,,PMC1219902,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Transgenic mouse models of this disease demonstrate that enforced expression of Lmo1 and Lmo2 cause T cell leukaemias with long latency and that Lmo2 expression leads to an inhibition of the T cell differentiation programme, prior to overt disease. These functions appear to be partly mediated by interaction of LMO1 or LMO2 with the LIM-binding protein LDB1/ NLI1. We have now identified a new member of the Lmo family, designated Lmo4, via its interaction with Ldb1. Lmo4 is widely expressed in mouse tissues, including adult thymus (mainly CD4, CD8-double positive T cells) and embryonic thymus (mainly CD4, CD8-double negative T cells). These characteristics imply that Ldb1-Lmo4 interaction may function in the T cell developmental programme and that enforced expression of LMO1 or LMO2 by chromosomal translocations or transgenesis may displace Lmo4 from this complex and thereby influence T cell differentiation prior to T cell tumour occurrence.","['Grutz, G', 'Forster, A', 'Rabbitts, T H']","['Grutz G', 'Forster A', 'Rabbitts TH']","['MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology, Division of Protein and Nucleic Acid Chemistry, Cambridge, UK.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (LDB1 protein, human)', '0 (LIM Domain Proteins)', '0 (Ldb1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Lmo1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Lmo2 protein, mouse)', '0 (Lmo4 protein, mouse)', '0 (Metalloproteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",IM,"['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/*genetics', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/*physiology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental', 'Genes', 'Homeodomain Proteins/*genetics/physiology', 'LIM Domain Proteins', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*genetics', 'Metalloproteins/genetics/*physiology', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', '*Multigene Family', 'Nuclear Proteins', '*Oncogene Proteins', 'Organ Specificity', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid', 'T-Lymphocyte Subsets/*metabolism', 'Thymus Gland/embryology/growth & development/metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics/physiology', 'Translocation, Genetic']",1998/12/05 00:00,1998/12/05 00:01,['1998/12/05 00:00'],"['1998/12/05 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/12/05 00:01 [medline]', '1998/12/05 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.onc.1202502 [doi]'],ppublish,Oncogene. 1998 Nov 26;17(21):2799-803. doi: 10.1038/sj.onc.1202502.,,,,,,,['GENBANK/AF096996'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here we show by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) that these coamplified sequences, MCR (Myc Coamplified Region), are derived from a locus located 3-4 Mb telomeric to the c-myc gene in the q24.2-24.3 region of chromosome 8. Genomic cloning and Southern blot analysis indicate the arrangement of chimeric amplicons are in tandem arrays. Analysis of the DNA sequences at the juncture of the MYC locus and the MCR suggest that these non syntenic regions were joined by nonhomologous recombination events. Visualization of the organization of the amplified DNA by fiber-FISH analysis illustrates we have cloned the complete amplicon. This is the first complete mammalian amplicon to be cloned and have its structure visualized. In addition to the major class of tandemly repeated amplicons, a second class of amplicons was detected by fiber-FISH in which the extent of the MCR component is about twice the size of the MCR component in the major amplicon. These longer amplicons most likely contain inverted repeats of MCR and MYC region sequences. Whether the amplicons contain mixtures of these two types of structures or separate amplicons only contain one type of structure has not yet been resolved. Properties of the MCR sequences responsible for retention in the chimeric HL60 amplicons upon long term passage are discussed.","['Mangano, R', 'Piddini, E', 'Carramusa, L', 'Duhig, T', 'Feo, S', 'Fried, M']","['Mangano R', 'Piddini E', 'Carramusa L', 'Duhig T', 'Feo S', 'Fried M']","['Dipartimento di Biologia Cellulare e dello Sviluppo, Universita di Palermo, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Blotting, Southern', '*Chromosome Aberrations', '*Chromosome Fragility', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 8/*genetics/ultrastructure', 'Cloning, Molecular', '*Gene Amplification', '*Genes, myc', 'HL-60 Cells/*chemistry', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*genetics/pathology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*genetics', 'Recombination, Genetic', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA']",1998/12/05 00:00,1998/12/05 00:01,['1998/12/05 00:00'],"['1998/12/05 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/12/05 00:01 [medline]', '1998/12/05 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.onc.1202434 [doi]'],ppublish,Oncogene. 1998 Nov 26;17(21):2771-7. doi: 10.1038/sj.onc.1202434.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, their mechanistic relationship remains to be elucidated. Here we investigated the roles of caspases in apoptosis and necrosis induced by ROS, generated by the mixture of xanthine and xanthine oxidase (X/XO). A low concentration of XO (0.025 U/ml) induced DNA fragmentation with little cellular membrane damage 3 h after treatment, suggesting the induction of apoptosis. The same treatment induced membrane blebbing, a morphological change typical of apoptosis, 15 min after treatment. A high concentration of XO (0.1 U/ml) damaged cell membranes with little concomitance of DNA fragmention, suggesting the induction of necrosis. ROS also activated caspase 3-like proteases and caspase 3 itself together with the release of cytochrome c which might be the cause of caspase activation. Apoptosis induced by low concentrations of XO and necrosis induced by high concentrations of XO was inhibited by z-DEVD-CH2F, an irreversible inhibitor of caspase 3. However, rapid induction of membrane blebbing was not inhibited by z-DEVD-CH2F. These results suggest that both apoptosis and necrosis could be induced by ROS through the activation of caspase 3-like protease; however, caspase 3 activation is not needed for ROS-induced membrane blebbing.","['Higuchi, M', 'Honda, T', 'Proske, R J', 'Yeh, E T']","['Higuchi M', 'Honda T', 'Proske RJ', 'Yeh ET']","['Research Center for Cardiovascular Diseases, Institute of Molecular Medicine for the Prevention of Human Diseases, The University of Texas-Houston Health Science Center, 77030, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (Cytochrome c Group)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Protease Inhibitors)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '1AVZ07U9S7 (Xanthine)', 'EC 1.17.3.2 (Xanthine Oxidase)', 'EC 3.4.- (Endopeptidases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/drug effects/*physiology', 'Caspase 3', 'Caspases/*physiology', 'Cell Membrane/drug effects/ultrastructure', 'Cytochrome c Group/metabolism', 'DNA Fragmentation', 'Endopeptidases/*physiology', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/pathology', 'Necrosis', 'Neoplasm Proteins/physiology', 'Oxidative Stress', 'Protease Inhibitors/pharmacology', '*Reactive Oxygen Species', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Xanthine/metabolism', 'Xanthine Oxidase/metabolism']",1998/12/05 00:00,1998/12/05 00:01,['1998/12/05 00:00'],"['1998/12/05 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/12/05 00:01 [medline]', '1998/12/05 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.onc.1202211 [doi]'],ppublish,Oncogene. 1998 Nov 26;17(21):2753-60. doi: 10.1038/sj.onc.1202211.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We used molecular markers of clonality to study the process of tumor progression of SJL lymphomas in vivo. This was accomplished at time intervals ranging from 2 to 116 days by initial partial splenectomy (biopsy) followed by spleen sampling at the time of killing (autopsy). Immunoglobulin heavy chain (IgH) gene rearrangement and murine leukemia virus (MuLV) proviral integration patterns were used to study the clonal identities of the sequential tumor pairs in 11 informative mice by Southern blot hybridization. Of these 11 mice, 5 showed the same number of IgH gene rearrangement bands in the matched biopsy-autopsy samples, indicating the persistence of the original lesions. In 2 of 11 mice, a decrease in the number of IgH gene rearrangement bands was seen, consistent with a process of clonal selection in the original oligoclonal population. Another 2 of 11 mice showed an increase in the IgH gene rearrangement bands, indicating the emergence of either a new unrelated clone or, less likely, a subclone with secondary IgH gene rearrangement. The remaining two mice showed differences between the patterns in biopsy and autopsy samples, as assessed by IgH gene rearrangement and the proviral integration analysis. This finding suggests that the biopsied tumor had regressed and new clones had emerged. Tumor development was also associated with an increase in the number of clonal MuLV insertions in all mice except one, in which no non-germline integration band was detected. Of 11 mice, 5 showed an increase in the extent of tumor involvement by microscopic examination of the biopsy and autopsy samples; 3 showed a decrease, whereas 2 showed no change. A change in tumor morphology toward a more dedifferentiated appearance was found in only 1 of 11 mice. Overall, the results did not show a single paradigm that tumor progression followed, rather they indicated a complex and dynamic process of clonal evolution, which is likely to be a major feature of lymphoma progression in vivo.","['Tang, J C', 'Ho, F C', 'Chan, A C', 'Chow, E Y', 'Srivastava, G']","['Tang JC', 'Ho FC', 'Chan AC', 'Chow EY', 'Srivastava G']","['Department of Pathology, University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Lab Invest,Laboratory investigation; a journal of technical methods and pathology,0376617,"['0 (Genetic Markers)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Clone Cells/pathology', 'Disease Progression', 'Gene Rearrangement', 'Genetic Markers', 'Genome, Viral', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/genetics', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/genetics', 'Lymphoma/pathology/*physiopathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred Strains', 'Spleen/*pathology']",1998/12/05 00:00,1998/12/05 00:01,['1998/12/05 00:00'],"['1998/12/05 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/12/05 00:01 [medline]', '1998/12/05 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Lab Invest. 1998 Nov;78(11):1459-66.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Multilaser flow cytometry techniques using probes for live cell function were used to monitor the biochemical changes that occurred prior to the loss of surface membrane integrity. These showed increases in the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and in the glutathione (GSH) content of irradiated cells. An additional population of cells that showed a further increase in ROS and depletion of GSH was seen in irradiated cells but not in controls. This population showed loss of mitochondrial membrane potential (deltapsim), indicative of the mitochondrial permeability transition, and exposure of phosphatidylserine on the cell surface. Increases in intracellular calcium were observed in a proportion of these low-deltapsi(m)/high-ROS cells. Similar findings were seen using the antileukemia drug cytosine arabinoside (ara-C), although cell cycle analysis showed that the loss of deltapsi(m) occurred mainly in G1 phase with ara-C treatment, and mainly in G2 phase with irradiation. Furthermore, the protective effect of overexpression of BCL2 was more pronounced after ara-C treatment than with radiation. Cells of the TP53 (formerly known as p53)-null human AML line OCI M2 showed growth arrest in G2 phase after radiation treatment, with no loss of deltapsi(m) or morphological changes indicative of apoptosis. The flavine-dependent oxidoreductase inhibitor diphenylene iodonium failed to inhibit generation of ROS in irradiated OCI/AML-2 cells, indicating that the mechanism is unlikely to involve the TP53-induced gene PIG3. These results show that oxidative stress can occur in irradiated human leukemia ""blasts"", and may play a direct role in radiation-induced apoptosis.","['Sheng-Tanner, X', 'Bump, E A', 'Hedley, D W']","['Sheng-Tanner X', 'Bump EA', 'Hedley DW']","['Division of Experimental Therapeutics, Ontario Cancer Institute, Toronto, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Radiat Res,Radiation research,0401245,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Phosphatidylserines)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', 'GAN16C9B8O (Glutathione)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects/*physiology/*radiation effects', 'Calcium/metabolism', 'Cytarabine/pharmacology', 'Flow Cytometry/methods', 'Gamma Rays', 'Genes, bcl-2', 'Glutathione/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Lasers', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/metabolism/pathology/radiotherapy', 'Membrane Potentials/drug effects/radiation effects', 'Mitochondria/drug effects/metabolism/radiation effects', 'Oxidative Stress/*physiology/*radiation effects', 'Phosphatidylserines/metabolism', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/metabolism']",1998/12/05 00:00,1998/12/05 00:01,['1998/12/05 00:00'],"['1998/12/05 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/12/05 00:01 [medline]', '1998/12/05 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Radiat Res. 1998 Dec;150(6):636-47.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

They are characterized by odontoclastic resorptive processes, which take place at the dental root and at the periodontium. Chronic inflammation of gingiva and periodontium is believed to be an important etiological factor in the development of FORL. In this context, various feline viruses have been discussed to play a relevant role in the pathogenesis of these lesions. The aim of this project was to determine in a blinded study the incidence of FORL in 10 cats which were infected for several years with feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV), but were otherwise free of feline viral infections (feline leukemia virus, feline calicivirus, feline herpesvirus, feline parvovirus, feline coronavirus, feline syncytium-forming virus). Nine age-matched controls were kept under identical conditions, but free of FIV. Subgingival resorptive lesions were found in six of 10 FIV-positive cats, but in three of nine controls only. FIV-positive cats had significantly more often gingivae with an increased tendency for bleeding upon probing than FIV-negative cats (p=0.0055), and they had slightly more often hyperplastic gingivae (p=0.0867). In conclusion, signs characteristic of FORL such as subgingival lesions, granulomatous or hyperplastic gingivae with a tendency for bleeding, were found significantly more often in FIV-positive cats than in the controls (p=0.0198). Therefore, it was concluded that FIV infection is an important factor for the occurrence of FORL, possibly through immune suppression or changes of the (sub)gingival micro-environment. However, non-infected control cats also showed some evidence of FORL in the absence of all tested viral infections. Therefore, factors other than viral infections must also play a role in the development of FORL in cats.","['Hofmann-Lehmann, R', 'Berger, M', 'Sigrist, B', 'Schawalder, P', 'Lutz, H']","['Hofmann-Lehmann R', 'Berger M', 'Sigrist B', 'Schawalder P', 'Lutz H']","['Department of Internal Veterinary Medicine, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, University of Zurich, Switzerland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Vet Immunol Immunopathol,Veterinary immunology and immunopathology,8002006,"['0 (Antibodies, Viral)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Viral/analysis', 'CD4-CD8 Ratio', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Cat Diseases/*etiology/pathology', 'Cats', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay/veterinary', 'Feline Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome/*complications/immunology/pathology', 'Immunodeficiency Virus, Feline/immunology/isolation & purification', 'Incidence', 'Risk Factors', 'Root Resorption/etiology/pathology/*veterinary', 'Specific Pathogen-Free Organisms', 'Stomatognathic Diseases/etiology/pathology/*veterinary']",1998/12/05 00:00,1998/12/05 00:01,['1998/12/05 00:00'],"['1998/12/05 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/12/05 00:01 [medline]', '1998/12/05 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0165-2427(98)00163-9 [pii]', '10.1016/s0165-2427(98)00163-9 [doi]']",ppublish,Vet Immunol Immunopathol. 1998 Oct 23;65(2-4):299-308. doi: 10.1016/s0165-2427(98)00163-9.,,,PMC7119809,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Genistein (4',5,7-trihydroxyisoflavone), an inhibitor of PIP kinase (1-phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate 5-kinase, EC 2.7.1.68), tyrosine kinase and topoisomerase-II, induces arrest in G2 and/or early M phase in most carcinoma cells. Both drugs, as single agents, induce differentiation. Since tiazofurin and genistein attack different enzymic targets and arrest the cell cycle at different phases and they each induce differentiation, we tested the hypothesis that tiazofurin might be synergistic with genistein in inducing differentiation. Human leukemic K-562 cells were grown in suspension culture and were seeded in 24-well culture plates. In growth inhibition assays for tiazofurin and genistein IC50s (drug concentration that inhibits 50% of cell proliferation) were 7 and 37 microM, respectively. For tiazofurin and genistein the concentrations of drug that induce differentiation in 50% of the cells were 35 and 45 microM, respectively. Various combinations of these two drugs were tested. Since tiazofurin decreased GTP concentration in cells by 50% at 12 hr after administration, genistein (10 to 30 microM) was added 12 hr after tiazofurin (5 to 15 microM). Synergistic action on differentiation was obtained from all tiazofurin and genistein combinations and in most combinations on growth inhibition. The percent of differentiating cells induced by genistein (10 microM) and tiazofurin (10 microM) as single agents increased 1.1- and 2.8-fold, respectively, of the control values. The two drugs together caused 5.9-fold elevation in inducing differentiation.

Most cases involve one single organ which, in the majority, is related directly to the presence of tumour. We describe a 44-year-old man with a clinical picture of multifocal fibrosclerosis (with mesenteric panniculitis, peritoneal, mediastinal and orbital fibrosis) in which the autopsy showed a systemic infiltrate of crystal-storing histiocytes and functional alteration of the organs involved, associated with IgG-kappa type immunocytoma. METHODS AND RESULTS: Histology showed a systemic infiltration, with a predilection for adipose tissue, by a diffuse cellular infiltrate composed of small lymphocytes, plasmacytoid lymphocytes and plasma cells, admixed with large number of crystal-storing histiocytes. Intracytoplasmic crystals were not identified either in the plasma cells or plasmacytoid lymphocytes. The neoplastic cells and the crystalline inclusions displayed reactivity with antibodies for IgG and the kappa light chain. A polymerase chain reaction study for the IgH gene showed a monoclonal rearrangement. Ultrastructural studies showed needle-shaped crystals surrounded by a single unit membrane. CONCLUSION: This case is, to the authors' knowledge, the first to be described in which crystal-storing histiocytosis is associated with a clinical picture of multifocal fibrosclerosis, which suggests that lymphoproliferative processes should be considered in the differential diagnosis of the various conditions associated with multifocal fibrosclerosis.","['Garc-ia, J F', 'Sanchez, E', 'Lloret, E', 'Martin, J', 'Piris, M A']","['Garc-ia JF', 'Sanchez E', 'Lloret E', 'Martin J', 'Piris MA']","['Department of Pathology, Hospital Virgen de la Salud, Toledo, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",England,Histopathology,Histopathology,7704136,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/metabolism', 'Crystallization', 'Fatal Outcome', 'Histiocytes/metabolism/ultrastructure', 'Histiocytosis/*complications/metabolism/pathology', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Inclusion Bodies/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*complications/metabolism/pathology', 'Male', 'Microscopy, Electron', 'Retroperitoneal Fibrosis/*complications/metabolism/pathology', 'Sclerosis']",1998/12/05 00:00,1998/12/05 00:01,['1998/12/05 00:00'],"['1998/12/05 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/12/05 00:01 [medline]', '1998/12/05 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1046/j.1365-2559.1998.00531.x [doi]'],ppublish,Histopathology. 1998 Nov;33(5):459-64. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2559.1998.00531.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS AND RESULTS: Eighty-seven pancreatic carcinomas were studied immunohistochemically with antibodies to bcl-2, mcl-1, bax and caspases 3, 6 and 8. Apoptosis was detected by the TUNEL method. bcl-2 and mcl-1 positivity was observed in 13% and 86% of the cases, while bax was observed in all of them. The bax immunoreactivity was weak in 30% of the tumours. Caspase 3, 6 and 8 immunoreactivity was observed in 80%, 80% and 74% of the cases, respectively. The staining was mainly cytoplasmic and diffuse, but sometimes also fragmented granular (mainly caspase 6) or membrane-associated (mainly caspase 8) staining was seen. The mean apoptotic index in pancreatic carcinomas was 0.69%. The apoptotic index in bcl-2 positive cases was lower (0.35%) than in cases showing no immunoreactivity (0.64%) (P = 0.013). The apoptotic index was higher in tumours with strong bax immunoreactivity (0.70%) than in the other cases (0.34%) (P = 0.002). There was no significant association between the apoptotic index and the expression of mcl-1 or caspases 3, 6 and 8. CONCLUSIONS: Both bcl-2 and bax influence the extent of apoptosis in pancreatic carcinoma. The strong expression of caspases 3, 6 and 8 in pancreatic carcinoma is evidence of the activation of the apoptotic machinery in malignant cells in pancreatic carcinoma and shows that the genes of these proteins are often upregulated in them.","['Virkajarvi, N', 'Paakko, P', 'Soini, Y']","['Virkajarvi N', 'Paakko P', 'Soini Y']","['Department of Pathology, University of Oulu, Finland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Histopathology,Histopathology,7704136,"['0 (BAX protein, human)', '0 (Enzyme Precursors)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP6 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP8 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP9 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 6)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 8)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 9)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",IM,"['Adenocarcinoma/metabolism/pathology', '*Apoptosis', 'Caspase 3', 'Caspase 6', 'Caspase 8', 'Caspase 9', 'Caspases/*biosynthesis', 'Enzyme Precursors/biosynthesis', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*biosynthesis', 'Pancreatic Neoplasms/metabolism/*pathology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*biosynthesis', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*biosynthesis', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein']",1998/12/05 00:00,1998/12/05 00:01,['1998/12/05 00:00'],"['1998/12/05 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/12/05 00:01 [medline]', '1998/12/05 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1046/j.1365-2559.1998.00553.x [doi]'],ppublish,Histopathology. 1998 Nov;33(5):432-9. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2559.1998.00553.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Fine-needle aspiration diagnosis of these neoplasms can be particularly difficult when the neoplasms are composed of poorly differentiated cells or fail to produce a stroma. MIC-2 is a highly sensitive and specific marker for the PNET/ES group of neoplasms and has been studied extensively in surgical pathology. Other small blue cell neoplasms including rhabdomyosarcoma, blastemal Wilm's tumor, and lymphoblastic lymphoma have also shown positivity, but the staining reactions are usually weak and focal. The utility of this marker in the differential of small blue cell neoplasms in cytologic material has not been examined. Twenty cases of small blue cell neoplasms obtained by fine-needle aspiration (FNA) were studied. MIC-2 antibody was applied retrospectively to formalin-fixed cell block material and destained alcohol-fixed and air-dried cytologic preparations. These cases include primitive neuroectodermal tumor (five cases), Ewing's sarcoma (two cases), neuroblastoma (four cases), Wilms's tumor (four cases), lymphoblastic lymphoma (two cases), and small-cell carcinoma (three cases). The cases were judged positive when the majority of the cells showed cytoplasmic staining. Diffuse cytoplasmic staining was observed in all seven cases of PNET/ES. Staining could be seen on the destained air-dried smears (three cases), fixed smears (two cases), or the cell block material (two cases). None of the other 13 small blue cell neoplasms showed positive staining. We conclude that MIC-2 is a sensitive and specific marker for the PNET/ES group of neoplasms in specimens from formalin-fixed cell block, air-dried, and alcohol-fixed cytologic material and is useful in the differential diagnosis of small blue cell tumors.","['Halliday, B E', 'Slagel, D D', 'Elsheikh, T E', 'Silverman, J F']","['Halliday BE', 'Slagel DD', 'Elsheikh TE', 'Silverman JF']","['Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, East Carolina University School of Medicine, Greenville, North Carolina, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Diagn Cytopathol,Diagnostic cytopathology,8506895,"['0 (12E7 Antigen)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (CD99 protein, human)', '0 (Cell Adhesion Molecules)']",IM,"['12E7 Antigen', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Animals', 'Antigens, CD/*analysis', 'Carcinoma, Neuroendocrine/*diagnosis/pathology', 'Cell Adhesion Molecules/*analysis', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunoenzyme Techniques', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Middle Aged', 'Neuroblastoma/*diagnosis/pathology', 'Neuroectodermal Tumors, Primitive, Peripheral/*diagnosis/pathology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*diagnosis/pathology', 'Sarcoma, Ewing/*diagnosis/pathology', 'Staining and Labeling/methods/statistics & numerical data', 'Wilms Tumor/*diagnosis/pathology']",1998/12/05 03:44,2000/06/22 10:00,['1998/12/05 03:44'],"['1998/12/05 03:44 [pubmed]', '2000/06/22 10:00 [medline]', '1998/12/05 03:44 [entrez]']","['10.1002/(SICI)1097-0339(199812)19:6<410::AID-DC2>3.0.CO;2-Z [pii]', '10.1002/(sici)1097-0339(199812)19:6<410::aid-dc2>3.0.co;2-z [doi]']",ppublish,Diagn Cytopathol. 1998 Dec;19(6):410-6. doi: 10.1002/(sici)1097-0339(199812)19:6<410::aid-dc2>3.0.co;2-z.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Ten out of 15 patients were found to have hprt-Mfs exceeding the 99% confidence limits as calculated from observations of healthy controls. Although there was some intraindividual variation, serial measurements of hprt-Mfs with intervals of more than 6 months revealed that hprt-Mfs were fairly stable. Patients with high Mfs tended to have sibling clones as detected by clonality analysis using the T-cell receptor (TCR) rearrangement pattern, but clonality did not have a major effect on the Mfs. On the other hand, Mfs at the TCR locus and sister chromatid exchange frequency were within the normal range in all patients.

Since the formation of retinoic acid isomers with different receptor affinities might modulate retinoic acid response in vitro, we determined retinoic acid disposition in HL-60 cells and cell culture medium during incubation with 13-cis-, 9-cis-, and all-trans-RA. In medium, retinoic acids underwent a thiol-radical mediated isomerization resulting in a mixture of 13-cis-, 9-cis-, 9,13-di-cis-, and all-trans-RA. Except for the 9, 13-di-cis-RA, all isomers generated in medium were also detected in HL-60 cells. Whereas 9-cis-RA and 13-cis-RA showed similar cellular pharmacokinetics, all-trans-RA reached about fourfold higher concentrations in HL-60 cells compared to 9-cis-RA and 13-cis-RA. Due to its better uptake, all-trans-RA became the main isomer within cells as it was formed in the medium when incubated with 13-cis-RA and 9-cis-RA. Thus, due to the simple chemically induced isomerization and its profound influence on cellular retinoic acid concentrations, studies of the efficacy of single retinoic acid isomers in vitro should be interpreted with caution.","['Lanvers, C', 'Hempel, G', 'Blaschke, G', 'Boos, J']","['Lanvers C', 'Hempel G', 'Blaschke G', 'Boos J']","['Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, University of Munster, 48149 Munster, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",United States,FASEB J,FASEB journal : official publication of the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology,8804484,"['0 (Culture Media)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'EH28UP18IF (Isotretinoin)']",IM,"['Biological Transport', 'Culture Media/chemistry', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Isomerism', 'Isotretinoin/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*metabolism', 'Tretinoin/*metabolism']",1998/12/05 00:00,1998/12/05 00:01,['1998/12/05 00:00'],"['1998/12/05 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/12/05 00:01 [medline]', '1998/12/05 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1096/fasebj.12.15.1627 [doi]'],ppublish,FASEB J. 1998 Dec;12(15):1627-33. doi: 10.1096/fasebj.12.15.1627.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Vpr has been shown to facilitate HIV infection of non-dividing cells such as macrophages by contributing to the nuclear translocation of the pre-integration complex. More recently, Vpr expression has been shown to induce an accumulation of cells at the G2 phase of the cell-cycle. We have previously reported that Vpr stimulates reporter gene expression directed from the HIV-1 long terminal repeat (LTR) as well as from heterologous viral promoters. However, the mode of action of Vpr-mediated transactivation remains to be precisely defined. We report here that, for a constant amount of transfected DNA, the level of chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) mRNA is increased in Vpr-expressing cells using either HIV-1 or a murine leukemia virus (MLV) SL3-3 LTR-CAT reporter construct. Moreover, this Vpr-mediated transactivation requires that promoters direct a minimal level of basal expression. Our mutagenic analysis indicates that the transactivation mediated by Vpr is not dependent on the ability of the protein to localize in the nucleus or to be packaged in the virions. Interestingly, all transactivation-competent Vpr mutants were still able to induce a cell-cycle arrest. Conversely, transactivation-defective mutants lost the ability to mediate cell-cycle arrest, implying a functional relationship between these two functions. Overall, our results indicate that the G2 cell-cycle arrest mediated by Vpr creates a cellular environment where the HIV-1 LTR is transcriptionally more active.","['Forget, J', 'Yao, X J', 'Mercier, J', 'Cohen, E A']","['Forget J', 'Yao XJ', 'Mercier J', 'Cohen EA']","['Departement de Microbiologie et Immunologie, Universite de Montreal, Montreal, Quebec, H3C 3J7, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,J Mol Biol,Journal of molecular biology,2985088R,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (Gene Products, vpr)', '0 (vpr Gene Products, Human Immunodeficiency Virus)', 'EC 2.3.1.28 (Chloramphenicol O-Acetyltransferase)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Chloramphenicol O-Acetyltransferase/genetics', 'DNA Primers/genetics', 'DNA, Viral/genetics', 'G2 Phase', 'Gene Products, vpr/chemistry/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Genes, Reporter', 'Genes, Viral', 'HIV Long Terminal Repeat', 'HIV-1/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/genetics', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutation', 'Phenotype', '*Transcriptional Activation', 'vpr Gene Products, Human Immunodeficiency Virus']",1998/12/05 00:00,1998/12/05 00:01,['1998/12/05 00:00'],"['1998/12/05 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/12/05 00:01 [medline]', '1998/12/05 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0022-2836(98)92206-9 [pii]', '10.1006/jmbi.1998.2206 [doi]']",ppublish,J Mol Biol. 1998 Dec 11;284(4):915-23. doi: 10.1006/jmbi.1998.2206.,,,,,,['Copyright 1998 Academic Press.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We also found that these nucleosides gradually decomposed in neutral solution but not in acidic solution. This decomposition may be related to the generation of aminoxy radicals at the sugar moiety. The in vitro cytotoxicity of these nucleosides was evaluated using L1210 and KB cells. 2'-DHAC (19) inhibited the growth of L1210 and KB cells, with IC50 values of 1.58 and 1.99 microM, respectively. 3'-DHAC (45) and 3'-dDHAC (52) were also cytotoxic against L1210 cells, with IC50 values of 4.03 and 1.84 microM, respectively, but not against KB cells.

CZOP was given at a daily dose of 4 g by drip intravenously to patients who were febrile over 38 degrees C and were suspected as having bacterial infections. As underlying diseases, 8 patients had acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), 9 acute myeloblastic leukemia (AML), 2 aplastic anemia (AA), 2 adult T cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATLL), 28 non Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), and 2 multiple myeloma (MM). Bacterial infections diagnosed were sepsis in 7 patients, suspected sepsis in 32, bronchitis in 6, pneumonia in 5 and acute peritonitis in 1. Clinical responses among 51 evaluable cases were excellent in 14, good in 15, fair in 3, poor in 19 and the overall response rate was 57%. The overall response rates for AML, ALL, AA, ATLL, NHL and MM were 56%, 63%, 100%, 50%, 50%, and 100%, respectively. Those for sepsis, suspected sepsis, bronchitis, pneumonia and acute peritonitis were 14%, 63%, 100%, 40%, and 0%, respectively. This therapy was effective in 53% (9/17) of patients whose granulocyte count remained below 500/microliter throughout the course of CZOP therapy. Six bacterial and one fungal strains were isolated from blood and sputum of six patients including five sepsis cases; two bacteria were eradicated and bacterial change was observed in one case. As side adverse effects, 10 patients had liver dysfunction, 1 anemia, 2 proteinemia, 1 indirect bilirubinemia, 2 thrombocytopenia, and 1 eosinophilia. We tried to establish a scoring system for the severities of patients with their infections, underlying diseases, treatments for the underlying disease, and granulocyte counts in order to evaluate the efficacy of CZOP more precisely. This scoring system was consisted of three grades; severe, moderate, and mild. CZOP was effective on mild and moderate grades. These results indicate that the initial antibacterial therapy by CZOP is useful for the treatment of mild and moderate grade infections complicated with hematological malignancies.","['Sasai, Y', 'Iwai, T', 'Tamura, A', 'Nakazawa, N', 'Ueda, Y', 'Kaneko, H', 'Horiike, S', 'Yokota, S', 'Taniwaki, M', 'Kashima, K', 'Misawa, S', 'Tsuda, S', 'Ohgawara, Y']","['Sasai Y', 'Iwai T', 'Tamura A', 'Nakazawa N', 'Ueda Y', 'Kaneko H', 'Horiike S', 'Yokota S', 'Taniwaki M', 'Kashima K', 'Misawa S', 'Tsuda S', 'Ohgawara Y']","['Third Department of Internal Medicine, Kyoto Prefectural University of Medicine.']",['jpn'],"['Clinical Trial', 'English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Japan,Jpn J Antibiot,The Japanese journal of antibiotics,0154402,"['0 (Cephalosporins)', '1LG87K28LW (cefozopran)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Anemia, Aplastic/*complications', 'Bacterial Infections/*drug therapy', 'Bronchitis/drug therapy', 'Cephalosporins/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Granulocytes/cytology', 'Hodgkin Disease/complications', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*complications', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/complications', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/complications', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Lymphoma/*complications', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multiple Myeloma/complications', 'Peritonitis/drug therapy', 'Pneumonia/drug therapy', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/complications', 'Sepsis/drug therapy', 'Severity of Illness Index']",1998/12/04 00:00,1998/12/04 00:01,['1998/12/04 00:00'],"['1998/12/04 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/12/04 00:01 [medline]', '1998/12/04 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Jpn J Antibiot. 1998 Aug;51(8):501-8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technique using consensus primers for the IgH gene was used for remission and minimal residual disease (MRD) analysis in the follow-up of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) of B-cell lineage. Single-strand conformational polymorphism (SSCP) was used to distinguish the specific clonal amplicons from the background. The Authors found that, in a series of 22 patients followed-up for 5.3 to 11.1 years, the PCR-SSCP technique could detect at least one rearrangement at initial diagnosis in 21 (95%). All patients who remained in continuous complete remission were PCR-SSCP negative at remission controls. Ten of the 22 patients had one or more bone marrow relapses. The PCR-SSCP method demonstrated MRD in three of them. In 6 of the 7 (86%) of patients with disease recurrence from whom samples were taken within 6 months before a clinically overt relapse, PCR-SSCP became positive. The Authors conclude that PCR-SSCP of a rearrangement marker might have a role as a convenient technique for monitoring emerging relapse. It may also detect unrelated clones or ongoing secondary recombination events during progression. However, PCR-SSCP is not sensitive enough to detect MRD in all patients in whom disease will later recur.","['Thunberg, U', 'Sallstrom, J', 'Frost, B M', 'Lonnerholm, G', 'Sundstrom, C']","['Thunberg U', 'Sallstrom J', 'Frost BM', 'Lonnerholm G', 'Sundstrom C']","['Department of Pathology, University Hospital, Uppsala, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Diagn Mol Pathol,"Diagnostic molecular pathology : the American journal of surgical pathology, part B",9204924,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Genetic Markers)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)']",IM,"['Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/diagnosis/*genetics/*therapy', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Clone Cells', 'DNA, Neoplasm/*analysis', 'Female', 'Gene Rearrangement, B-Lymphocyte, Heavy Chain/*genetics', 'Genetic Markers', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/*genetics', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local/diagnosis', 'Neoplasm, Residual/diagnosis', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Polymorphism, Single-Stranded Conformational', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Rate']",1998/12/04 00:00,1998/12/04 00:01,['1998/12/04 00:00'],"['1998/12/04 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/12/04 00:01 [medline]', '1998/12/04 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/00019606-199806000-00004 [doi]'],ppublish,Diagn Mol Pathol. 1998 Jun;7(3):146-51. doi: 10.1097/00019606-199806000-00004.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PROCEDURE: Fifteen pediatric patients with AML, 4 relapsed and 11 primary refractory, were reinduced with a loading bolus of 0.5 g/m2 cytarabine (ara-C) followed immediately by a continuous infusion of ara-C (130 mg/m2/day) for 72 hours, followed with four daily doses (12 mg/m2/day) of mitoxantrone. Eight of 15 patients received an additional course of amsacrine and etoposide. RESULTS: Ten of 15 (66%) achieved complete response (CR) and 3 achieved partial response (PR) (20%), with an objective response rate of 86% after ara-C/mitoxantrone. One patient died before disease assessment, and one had no response after ara-C/mitoxantrone. Pharmacokinetic studies of ara-C and ara-U were performed in 13 of 15 patients. A steady-state (Css) ara-C concentration was achieved at 2 hours after the bolus ara-C dose and was maintained up to 72 hours. The Css plasma concentrations of ara-C and ara-U averaged 10.33 +/- 0.81 microM and 139.14 +/- 17.8 microM, respectively. Also, cellular pharmacokinetic studies of ara-CTP were performed on circulating leukemic cells from 5 patients. Four patients who had a significant increase (P = 0.0041) in their Css ara-CTP concentrations achieved CR, whereas one patient with an insignificant increase achieved PR. CONCLUSIONS: Continuous infusion of ara-C followed by mitoxantrone is an active reinduction regimen in refractory or relapsed pediatric AML patients. The addition of amsacrine and etoposide did not improve the remission induction rate. Further studies are needed in a larger patient population to confirm these observations.","['Ozkaynak, M F', 'Avramis, V I', 'Carcich, S', 'Ortega, J A']","['Ozkaynak MF', 'Avramis VI', 'Carcich S', 'Ortega JA']","['Department of Pediatrics, New York Medical College, Valhalla 10595, USA. mehmet-ozkaynak@nymc.edu']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Med Pediatr Oncol,Medical and pediatric oncology,7506654,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '00DPD30SOY (Amsacrine)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', 'BZ114NVM5P (Mitoxantrone)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Amsacrine/administration & dosage', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/blood/*pharmacokinetics', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Bone Marrow/*metabolism', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Cytarabine/blood/*pharmacokinetics', 'Etoposide/administration & dosage', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infusions, Intravenous', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/blood/*drug therapy/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Mitoxantrone/administration & dosage', 'Recurrence', 'Remission Induction']",1998/12/04 03:01,2000/06/20 09:00,['1998/12/04 03:01'],"['1998/12/04 03:01 [pubmed]', '2000/06/20 09:00 [medline]', '1998/12/04 03:01 [entrez]']","['10.1002/(SICI)1096-911X(199812)31:6<475::AID-MPO3>3.0.CO;2-7 [pii]', '10.1002/(sici)1096-911x(199812)31:6<475::aid-mpo3>3.0.co;2-7 [doi]']",ppublish,Med Pediatr Oncol. 1998 Dec;31(6):475-82. doi: 10.1002/(sici)1096-911x(199812)31:6<475::aid-mpo3>3.0.co;2-7.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Camptothecin (CPT), a topoisomerase I inhibitor, induced significantly more apoptosis in PLB-985 cells than in X-CGD cells. Sensitivity to CPT was enhanced after neutrophilic differentiation, but was lost after monocytic differentiation. No difference between the two cell lines was observed after treatment with other apoptosis inducers, including etoposide, ultraviolet radiation, ionizing radiation, hydrogen peroxide, or 7-hydroxystaurosporine. After granulocytic differentiation of both cell lines, CPT still induced apoptosis, suggesting independence from replication in fully differentiated and growth-arrested cells. Pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate (an antioxidant inhibitor of NF-kappaB) and catalase partially inhibited CPT-induced DNA fragmentation in granulocytic-differentiated PLB-985 cells, but had no effect in X-CGD cells. Flow cytometry analysis revealed that reactive oxygen intermediates were generated in CPT-treated PLB-985 cells. These data indicate that oxygen radicals generated by NADPH oxidase may contribute directly or indirectly to CPT-induced apoptosis in human leukemia and in neutrophilic-differentiated cells.","['Hiraoka, W', 'Vazquez, N', 'Nieves-Neira, W', 'Chanock, S J', 'Pommier, Y']","['Hiraoka W', 'Vazquez N', 'Nieves-Neira W', 'Chanock SJ', 'Pommier Y']","['Laboratory of Molecular Pharmacology, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, Maryland 20892, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,J Clin Invest,The Journal of clinical investigation,7802877,"['0 (Alkaloids)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Antioxidants)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Pyrrolidines)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '0 (Thiocarbamates)', '0 (Topoisomerase I Inhibitors)', '25769-03-3 (pyrrolidine dithiocarbamic acid)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', '7BU5H4V94A (7-hydroxystaurosporine)', 'BBX060AN9V (Hydrogen Peroxide)', 'EC 1.11.1.6 (Catalase)', 'EC 1.6.3.- (CYBB protein, human)', 'EC 1.6.3.- (NADPH Oxidase 2)', 'EC 1.6.3.- (NADPH Oxidases)', 'H88EPA0A3N (Staurosporine)', 'XT3Z54Z28A (Camptothecin)']",IM,"['Alkaloids/pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/*pharmacology', 'Antioxidants/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects/*physiology/radiation effects', 'Camptothecin/*pharmacology', 'Catalase/pharmacology', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Line', 'DNA Fragmentation/drug effects', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Etoposide/pharmacology', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Granulomatous Disease, Chronic/pathology', 'Humans', 'Hydrogen Peroxide/pharmacology', 'Leukemia/enzymology/metabolism/*pathology', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/*physiology', 'Monocytes/pathology', 'NADPH Oxidase 2', 'NADPH Oxidases/*metabolism', 'NF-kappa B/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*metabolism', 'Neutrophils/pathology', 'Pyrrolidines/pharmacology', '*Reactive Oxygen Species', 'Staurosporine/analogs & derivatives', 'Thiocarbamates/pharmacology', 'Topoisomerase I Inhibitors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Ultraviolet Rays']",1998/12/03 00:00,1998/12/03 00:01,['1998/12/03 00:00'],"['1998/12/03 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/12/03 00:01 [medline]', '1998/12/03 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1172/JCI3437 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Invest. 1998 Dec 1;102(11):1961-8. doi: 10.1172/JCI3437.,,,PMC509148,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Seventy-one patients undergoing cytoreductive therapy who required amphotericin B were randomly assigned in an unblinded fashion to a group receiving continuous-infusion low-dose dopamine (3 microgram/kg/min) or a group receiving no dopamine. Amphotericin B was dosed at 0.5 or 1.0 mg/kg/day based on computerized tomography scan results or presence of positive blood cultures. No patient received saline boluses. The rate of nephrotoxicity, severity as graded by Southwest Oncology Group toxicity criteria, and time to each grade of nephrotoxicity were compared between the two groups. Eighty percent of the no-dopamine group and 66.7% of the dopamine group developed nephrotoxicity, defined as a 1.5-fold or greater increase in baseline serum creatinine level (P = 0.20). No statistical difference was noted at any grade of nephrotoxicity between the two groups. Thirty-four percent of patients in the no-dopamine group versus 17.6% in the dopamine group had a 2.5-fold or greater increase in serum creatinine level, which was not statistically significant (P = 0.0888). Ten patients developed grade IV nephrotoxicity and were withdrawn from the study, 7 in the no-dopamine group and 3 in the dopamine group (P = 0.19). The time to each grade of nephrotoxicity was also not significantly different for the two groups. Eleven adverse drug reactions were reported in the dopamine group in comparison to one in the no-dopamine group. Thus, dopamine offers little in the way of prevention of nephrotoxicity associated with amphotericin B therapy. Although the significance of drug reactions in the dopamine group is not clearly established due to lack of cardiac monitoring in the no-dopamine group, dopamine therapy is not without complications.","['Camp, M J', 'Wingard, J R', 'Gilmore, C E', 'Lin, L S', 'Dix, S P', 'Davidson, T G', 'Geller, R B']","['Camp MJ', 'Wingard JR', 'Gilmore CE', 'Lin LS', 'Dix SP', 'Davidson TG', 'Geller RB']","['Department of Pharmaceutical Services, Emory University Hospital, Emory University, Atlanta, Georgia 30322, USA.

Recent studies suggest it may also play an important role in human embryo implantation. Our objective was to study the hormonal regulation of the production/secretion of LIF by the human endometrium. Endometrial LIF secretion in specimens obtained from women without ovarian function (n+/-14) at day 10 (4 mg of oestradiol regimen) or day 20 (oestradiol plus 300 mg of progesterone) of a simulated menstrual cycle was examined. LIF was detected in all cultured explants obtained both in the proliferative and secretory phase of the stimulated cycles. The levels of cytokine production by day 10 endometrial culture explants were 5-fold higher than by day 20 endometrial samples (mean+/-SEM, 24.3+/-8.6 versus 4.5+/-2.1 pg/mg, P < 0.01). This suggests that progesterone significantly down-regulates the endometrial LIF secretion. The effect of progesterone on LIF secretion by the endometrium in vitro was also examined. Explants of endometrium obtained from the same patients on day 10 of cycle were treated with 0.5 ng/ml of progesterone in vitro. This progesterone treatment significantly reduced LIF secretion by endometrial explants in vitro (mean+/-SEM, 20.3+/-4.8 versus 10.7+/-2.3 pg/mg, P < 0.05). These results suggest that LIF endometrial production is regulated by progesterone both in-vivo and in-vitro. The possible mechanisms of LIF regulation are discussed briefly.","['Hambartsoumian, E', 'Taupin, J L', 'Moreau, J F', 'Frydman, R', 'Chaouat, G']","['Hambartsoumian E', 'Taupin JL', 'Moreau JF', 'Frydman R', 'Chaouat G']","['Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Hopital Antoine Beclere, Clamart, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Mol Hum Reprod,Molecular human reproduction,9513710,"['0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '4G7DS2Q64Y (Progesterone)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Down-Regulation', 'Endometrium/*drug effects/*physiology', 'Female', 'Growth Inhibitors/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Humans', '*Interleukin-6', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Lymphokines/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Ovulation Induction', 'Progesterone/*pharmacology']",1998/12/03 00:00,1998/12/03 00:01,['1998/12/03 00:00'],"['1998/12/03 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/12/03 00:01 [medline]', '1998/12/03 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/molehr/4.11.1039 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Hum Reprod. 1998 Nov;4(11):1039-44. doi: 10.1093/molehr/4.11.1039.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Median follow up was 83 months. RESULTS: 16 patients were persistently PCR-positive and 7 patients persistently PCR-negative. The original transcript became negative in four patients. Only two of the positive cases developed hematologic relapse during the period of study. High white blood cell counts before BMT (17.88 vs 10.12 x 10(9)/l; p = 0.008) and immunosuppressive therapy for chronic graft-versus-host disease (p < 0.05) were associated with an increased ability to detect residual BCR-ABL positive cells.

We compared high-dose cytarabine with autologous or allogeneic marrow transplantation during the first remission of acute myeloid leukemia. METHODS: Previously untreated adolescents and adults 16 to 55 years of age who had acute myeloid leukemia received standard induction chemotherapy. After complete remission had been achieved, idarubicin (two days) and cytarabine (five days) were administered. Patients with histocompatible siblings were offered allogeneic marrow transplantation, whereas the remaining patients were randomly assigned to receive a single course of high-dose cytarabine or transplantation of autologous marrow treated with perfosfamide (4-hydroperoxycyclophosphamide). Oral busulfan and intravenous cyclophosphamide were used as preparative regimens for both allogeneic and autologous marrow transplantation. The end points were survival from the time of complete remission and disease-free survival. RESULTS: In an intention-to-treat analysis, we found no significant differences in disease-free survival among patients receiving high-dose chemotherapy, those undergoing autologous bone marrow transplantation, and those undergoing allogeneic marrow transplantation. The median follow-up was four years. Survival after complete remission was somewhat better after chemotherapy than after autologous marrow transplantation (P=0.05). There was a marginal advantage in terms of overall survival with chemotherapy as compared with allogeneic marrow transplantation (P=0.04). CONCLUSIONS: A postinduction course of high-dose cytarabine can provide equivalent disease-free survival and somewhat better overall survival than autologous marrow transplantation in adults with acute myeloid leukemia.","['Cassileth, P A', 'Harrington, D P', 'Appelbaum, F R', 'Lazarus, H M', 'Rowe, J M', 'Paietta, E', 'Willman, C', 'Hurd, D D', 'Bennett, J M', 'Blume, K G', 'Head, D R', 'Wiernik, P H']","['Cassileth PA', 'Harrington DP', 'Appelbaum FR', 'Lazarus HM', 'Rowe JM', 'Paietta E', 'Willman C', 'Hurd DD', 'Bennett JM', 'Blume KG', 'Head DR', 'Wiernik PH']","['University of Miami Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center, FL 33136, USA.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,N Engl J Med,The New England journal of medicine,0255562,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/*therapeutic use', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Cytarabine/*therapeutic use', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*drug therapy/mortality/*therapy', 'Middle Aged', 'Remission Induction', 'Survival Analysis', 'Transplantation Conditioning', 'Transplantation, Autologous', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",1998/12/03 00:00,1998/12/03 00:01,['1998/12/03 00:00'],"['1998/12/03 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/12/03 00:01 [medline]', '1998/12/03 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1056/NEJM199812033392301 [doi]'],ppublish,N Engl J Med. 1998 Dec 3;339(23):1649-56. doi: 10.1056/NEJM199812033392301.,"['CA14548/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA23318/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA38926/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']","['N Engl J Med. 1998 Dec 3;339(23):1698-700.

K562 cells expressing band 3 also displayed high levels of the Wrb blood group antigen, confirming the role of band 3 in Wrb expression, and an increase in the low levels of endogenous Rh antigen activity. We also performed coexpression experiments with K562 clones that had previously been transduced with cDNAs encoding RhD or RhcE polypeptides. The transfection and expression of band 3 in these clones substantially increased the levels of RhD and cE antigen activity expressed on the cells and also increased the reactivity of the cells with antibody to the endogenous Rh glycoprotein (RhGP, Rh50). The increased reactivity of Rh antigens may result from cell surface or intracellular interactions of band 3 with the protein complex which contains the Rh polypeptides and RhGP, or from indirect effects of band 3 on the membrane environment. This work establishes a system for cell surface expression of band 3 in a mammalian cell line, which will enable further studies of the protein and its interactions with other membrane components.","['Beckmann, R', 'Smythe, J S', 'Anstee, D J', 'Tanner, M J']","['Beckmann R', 'Smythe JS', 'Anstee DJ', 'Tanner MJ']","['Department of Biochemistry, University of Bristol, UK; and the International Blood Group Reference Laboratory, Bristol, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Anion Exchange Protein 1, Erythrocyte)', '0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (Rh-Hr Blood-Group System)']",IM,"['Anion Exchange Protein 1, Erythrocyte/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Cell Membrane/metabolism', 'DNA, Complementary/genetics', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*metabolism', 'Rh-Hr Blood-Group System/*metabolism', 'Transfection']",1998/12/03 00:00,1998/12/03 00:01,['1998/12/03 00:00'],"['1998/12/03 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/12/03 00:01 [medline]', '1998/12/03 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)57777-X [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1998 Dec 1;92(11):4428-38.,['Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Expression of CBFbeta-SMMHC in Ba/F3 cells reduced p53 induction in response to ionizing radiation or etoposide 3- to 4-fold. However, p53 induction was normal in Ba/F3 cells expressing a CBFbeta-SMMHC variant that does not interfere with DNA binding by CBF, indicating that a CBF genetic target regulates p53 induction. The p53 gene may be regulated by CBF, because p53 mRNA levels were reduced by CBFbeta-SMMHC. Reduced p53 induction was not caused by slowed cell proliferation, a consequence of CBFbeta-SMMHC expression, because p53 was induced similarly in control cultures and in cultures propagated in 10-fold less interleukin-3 (IL-3). CBFbeta-SMMHC did not slow apoptosis resulting from IL-3 withdrawal, where p53 induction is minimal, but slowed apoptosis in Ba/F3 cells exposed to 10 Gy of ionizing radiation or 3 to 8 microgram/mL etoposide, providing 2-fold protection at 6 or 18 hours. Inhibition of apoptosis was temporary, because all the cells exposed to these doses ultimately died, and clonal survival assays performed using 0. 04 microgram/mL etoposide did not show protection by CBFbeta-SMMHC. p21 levels were increased in cells subjected to DNA damage, regardless of CBFbeta-SMMHC expression and attenuated p53 induction. Bcl-2, bcl-xL, bcl-xS, and bax levels were unaffected by CBFbeta-SMMHC.

A 2', 5'-tetraadenylate activator (2-5A) of RNase L was chemically linked to oligonucleotide antisense directed against either the fusion site or against the translation start sequence in bcr/abl mRNA. Selective degradation of the targeted RNA sequences was demonstrated in assays with purified RNase L and decreases of p210(bcr/abl) kinase activity levels were obtained in the CML cell line, K562. Furthermore, the 2-5A-antisense chimeras suppressed growth of K562, while having substantially reduced effects on the promyelocytic leukemia cell line, HL60. Findings were extended to primary CML cells isolated from bone marrow of patients. The 2-5A-antisense treatments both suppressed proliferation of the leukemia cells and selectively depleted levels of bcr/abl mRNA without affecting levels of beta-actin mRNA, determined by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The specificity of this approach was further shown with control oligonucleotides, such as chimeras containing an inactive dimeric form of 2-5A, antisense lacking 2-5A, or chimeras with altered sequences including several mismatched nucleotides. The control oligonucleotides had either reduced or no effect on CML cell growth and bcr/abl mRNA levels. These findings show that CML cell growth can be selectively suppressed by targeting bcr/abl mRNA with 2-5A-antisense for decay by RNase L and suggest that these compounds should be further explored for their potential as ex vivo purging agents of autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplants from CML patients.","['Maran, A', 'Waller, C F', 'Paranjape, J M', 'Li, G', 'Xiao, W', 'Zhang, K', 'Kalaycio, M E', 'Maitra, R K', 'Lichtin, A E', 'Brugger, W', 'Torrence, P F', 'Silverman, R H']","['Maran A', 'Waller CF', 'Paranjape JM', 'Li G', 'Xiao W', 'Zhang K', 'Kalaycio ME', 'Maitra RK', 'Lichtin AE', 'Brugger W', 'Torrence PF', 'Silverman RH']","['Department of Cancer Biology, The Lerner Research Institute, and Department of Hematology and Oncology, Cleveland Clinic Foundation, Cleveland, OH,USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Adenine Nucleotides)', '0 (Oligonucleotides, Antisense)', '0 (Oligoribonucleotides)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', ""61172-40-5 (2',5'-oligoadenylate)"", 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'EC 3.1.- (Endoribonucleases)', 'EC 3.1.26.- (2-5A-dependent ribonuclease)']",IM,"['Adenine Nucleotides/genetics/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Endoribonucleases/*genetics/pharmacology', 'Enzyme Activation/genetics', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*antagonists & inhibitors/*genetics', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/drug therapy/*genetics', 'Oligonucleotides, Antisense/genetics/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Oligoribonucleotides/genetics/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'RNA, Messenger/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/*genetics/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1998/12/03 00:00,1998/12/03 00:01,['1998/12/03 00:00'],"['1998/12/03 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/12/03 00:01 [medline]', '1998/12/03 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)57767-7 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1998 Dec 1;92(11):4336-43.,['1 PO1 CA 62220/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Only a minority of these AML cells are capable of proliferation in vitro, suggesting that AML cells may be organized in a hierarchy, with only the most primitive of these cells capable of maintaining the leukemic clone. To further investigate this hypothesis, we have evaluated a strategy for purifying these primitive cells based on surface antigen expression. As an in vitro endpoint, we have determined the phenotype of AML progenitor cells which are capable of producing AML colony-forming cells (CFU) for up to 8 weeks in suspension culture (SC) and compared the phenotype with that of cells which reproduce AML in nonobese diabetic/severe combined immunodeficiency (NOD/SCID) mice. AML cells were fluorescence-activated cell sorted (FACS) for coexpression of CD34 and CD71, CD38, and/or HLA-DR and the subfractions were assayed in vitro and in vivo at various cell doses to estimate purification. While the majority of primary AML CFU lacked expression of CD34, most cells capable of producing CFU after 2 to 8 weeks in SC were CD34(+)/CD71(-). HLA-DR expression was heterogeneous on cells producing CFU after 2 to 4 weeks. However, after 6 to 8 weeks in SC, the majority of CFU were derived from CD34(+)/HLA-DR- cells. Similarly, the majority of cells capable of long-term CFU production from SC were CD34(+)/CD38(-). Most cells that were capable of engrafting NOD/SCID mice were also CD34(+)/CD71(-) and CD34(+)/HLA-DR-. Engraftment was not achieved with CD34(+)/CD71(+) or HLA-DR+ subfractions, however, in two patients, both the CD34(+) and CD34(-) subfractions were capable of engrafting the NOD/SCID mice. A three-color sorting strategy combining these antigens allowed approximately a 2-log purification of these NOD/SCID leukemia initiating cells, with engraftment achieved using as few as 400 cells in one experiment. Phenotyping studies suggest even higher purification could be achieved by combining lack of CD38 expression with the CD34(+)/CD71(-) or CD34(+)/HLA DR- phenotype. These results suggest that most AML cells capable of long-term proliferation in vitro and in vivo share the CD34(+)/CD71(-)/HLA-DR- phenotype with normal stem cells. Our data suggests that in this group of patients the leukemic transformation has occurred in a primitive progenitor, as defined by phenotype, with some degree of subsequent differentiation as defined by functional assays.","['Blair, A', 'Hogge, D E', 'Sutherland, H J']","['Blair A', 'Hogge DE', 'Sutherland HJ']","['Terry Fox Laboratory, British Columbia Cancer Agency, Vancouver Hospital and Health Sciences Centre, and the Department of Medicine, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, B-Lymphocyte)', '0 (CD71 antigen)', '0 (HLA-DR Antigens)', '0 (Receptors, Transferrin)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Animals', 'Antigens, CD/*immunology', 'Antigens, CD34/*immunology', 'Antigens, Differentiation, B-Lymphocyte/*immunology', 'Cell Division', 'Flow Cytometry', 'HLA-DR Antigens/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/immunology/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*immunology/pathology', 'Receptors, Transferrin', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1998/12/03 00:00,1998/12/03 00:01,['1998/12/03 00:00'],"['1998/12/03 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/12/03 00:01 [medline]', '1998/12/03 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)57766-5 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1998 Dec 1;92(11):4325-35.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

HSL11 reacts with lambda5 whereas HSL96 reacts with VpreB. Intriguingly, HSL2 does not bind to each component of the pre-BCR but does bind to the completely assembled pre-BCR complex. Flow cytometric analyses with cytoplasmic staining of a panel of human cell lines showed that HSL11 and HSL96 specifically stained cell lines derived from the pro-B and pre-B-cell stages of B-cell development. In contrast, HSL2 stained exclusively cell lines derived from the pre-B-cell stage. These results prompted us to explore the possibility of clinical application of these MoAbs for the determination of the cell lineage and developmental stage of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Whereas none of mature B-lineage ALLs (B-ALLs), T-lineage ALLs (T-ALLs), and acute myeloid leukemias analyzed were stained in the cytoplasm with these three MoAbs, the vast majority of non-B- and non-T-ALLs (53 out of 56 cases) were found positive for either lambda5, Vpre-B, or both in their cytoplasm. Among these 53 cytoplasmic SL chain-positive ALLs, 19 cases were also positive for cytoplasmic muH chain, indicative of pre-B-cell origin. Interestingly, 6 out of these 19 pre-B-ALL cases were found negative for cytoplasmic staining with HSL2. From these results, we propose a novel classification of B-ALL in which five subtypes are defined on the basis of the differential expression of SL chain, muH chain, pre-BCR, and light chain along the B-cell development.","['Tsuganezawa, K', 'Kiyokawa, N', 'Matsuo, Y', 'Kitamura, F', 'Toyama-Sorimachi, N', 'Kuida, K', 'Fujimoto, J', 'Karasuyama, H']","['Tsuganezawa K', 'Kiyokawa N', 'Matsuo Y', 'Kitamura F', 'Toyama-Sorimachi N', 'Kuida K', 'Fujimoto J', 'Karasuyama H']","['Department of Immunology, The Tokyo Metropolitan Institute of Medical Science, Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antibodies, Neoplasm)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/*immunology', 'Antibodies, Neoplasm/*immunology', 'B-Lymphocytes/*immunology/*pathology', '*Biomarkers, Tumor', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Lineage/*immunology', 'Flow Cytometry/methods', 'Humans', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/immunology/pathology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*immunology/*pathology', 'Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell/*immunology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1998/12/03 00:00,1998/12/03 00:01,['1998/12/03 00:00'],"['1998/12/03 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/12/03 00:01 [medline]', '1998/12/03 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)57765-3 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1998 Dec 1;92(11):4317-24.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The resulting PML-RAR protein induces a block in the differentiation of the myeloid progenitor cells, which can be released by retinoic acid (RA) in vitro and in vivo. The RA-induced differentiation of APL blasts is paralleled by the degradation of the fusion protein and the relocation of wild-type PML from aberrant nuclear structures to its normal localization in nuclear bodies. Recently, arsenic trioxide (As2O3) treatment was proposed as an alternative therapy in APL, because it can induce complete remission in both RA-sensitive and -resistant APL patients. Intriguingly, As2O3 was also shown to induce degradation of the PML-RAR chimera and to reorganize PML nuclear bodies. Here we show that trivalent antimonials also have striking effects on RA-sensitive and RA-resistant APL cells. Treatment of the APL-derived NB4 cells and the RA-resistant subclone NB4R4 with antimony trioxide or potassium antimonyl tartrat triggers the degradation of the fusion protein and the concomitant reorganization of the PML nuclear bodies. In addition, as reported for As2O3, the antimonials provoke apoptosis of NB4 and NB4R4 cells. The mechanism of antimony action is likely to be similar to that of As2O3, notably both substances induce the attachment of the ubiquitin-like SUMO-1 molecule to the PML moiety of PML-RAR. From these data, we propose that, in analogy to As2O3, antimonials might have a beneficial therapeutic effect on APL patients, perhaps with less toxicity than arsenic.","['Muller, S', 'Miller, W H Jr', 'Dejean, A']","['Muller S', 'Miller WH Jr', 'Dejean A']","['Unite de Recombinaison et Expression Genetique, INSERM U 163, Institut Pasteur, Paris, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (promyelocytic leukemia-retinoic acid receptor alpha fusion oncoprotein)', '9IT35J3UV3 (Antimony)']",IM,"['Antimony/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Cell Nucleus/*drug effects/ultrastructure', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/drug therapy/*metabolism/*pathology', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*metabolism', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1998/12/03 03:02,2001/03/28 10:01,['1998/12/03 03:02'],"['1998/12/03 03:02 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1998/12/03 03:02 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)57764-1 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1998 Dec 1;92(11):4308-16.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, we expanded this analysis to 42 clinical AML samples. We adapted a quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay for gene expression and a quantitative PCR after digestion by Hpa II for methylation status of the MDR1 gene. We observed a statistically significant inverse correlation between methylation and MDR1 expression in clinical samples.

In contrast, normal myeloid progenitors (colony-forming unit-granulocyte-macrophage) from six different donors treated and assayed under identical conditions were consistently insensitive to the same fusion toxin even when treated as highly purified CD34(+) cells. The leukemic progenitors from the two other JMML patients showed intermediate sensitivity to DT388-GM-CSF and the leukemic progenitors from eight of the 20 (40%) CMML patients were not different from normal progenitors. Parallel measurements of the number and affinity of GM-CSF receptors on cells from the same samples showed no consistent differences between JMML, CMML, and normal light density or CD34(+) bone marrow cells. The increased sensitivity of leukemic progenitors from all JMML progenitors and some CMML patients to the fusion toxin is therefore not likely to be explained by an increased density of GM-CSF receptors on these cells. We also examined the DT388-GM-CSF sensitivity of two murine cell lines transfected with cDNAs encoding varying portions of the human GM-CSF receptor and/or beta chains. These studies showed that high-affinity ligand binding was sufficient for DT388-GM-CSF-induced toxicity, as this could occur even in the absence of functional signal transduction and that the background of the host cell had a major influence on the degree to which this decreased the toxicity of DT388-GM-CSF. The selective sensitivity to DT388-GM-CSF of leukemic progenitors from a majority of JMML and CMML patients suggests that this agent could have therapeutic potential for some patients with these diseases.","['Frankel, A E', 'Lilly, M', 'Kreitman, R', 'Hogge, D', 'Beran, M', 'Freedman, M H', 'Emanuel, P D', 'McLain, C', 'Hall, P', 'Tagge, E', 'Berger, M', 'Eaves, C']","['Frankel AE', 'Lilly M', 'Kreitman R', 'Hogge D', 'Beran M', 'Freedman MH', 'Emanuel PD', 'McLain C', 'Hall P', 'Tagge E', 'Berger M', 'Eaves C']","['Wake Forest Comprehensive Cancer Center/Bowman Gray School of Medicine, Winston-Salem, NC, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Diphtheria Toxin)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Cell Death/drug effects', 'Child, Preschool', 'Diphtheria Toxin/genetics/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/genetics/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Chronic/drug therapy/*pathology', 'Lymphoproliferative Disorders/drug therapy/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*drug effects/pathology', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/genetics/*pharmacology/therapeutic use']",1998/12/03 00:00,1998/12/03 00:01,['1998/12/03 00:00'],"['1998/12/03 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/12/03 00:01 [medline]', '1998/12/03 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)57761-6 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1998 Dec 1;92(11):4279-86.,"['CA45672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01CA76178/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U01CA60407/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It has been postulated that TNF stimulates GM-CSF gene expression in an autocrine manner. We found here that the specific inhibition of TNF gene expression by a catalytic RNA molecule (ribozyme) also downregulated the expression of GM-CSF in JMML cells. GM-CSF protein, GM-CSF-dependent colony formation, and viability of JMML cells were reduced. The observed effect was specific, because synthesis of interleukin-1beta, another cytokine produced by JMML cells, was not affected by the ribozyme treatment. The stimulatory effect of TNF on GM-CSF gene expression in JMML cells probably takes place at the transcription level, because the ribozyme treatment decreased GM-CSF mRNA. No apparent toxicity of the ribozyme was detected in normal bone marrow progenitor cells. Thus, the inhibition of TNF gene expression in JMML cells by ribozymes may be a novel therapeutic approach for this disorder.","['Iversen, P O', 'Sioud, M']","['Iversen PO', 'Sioud M']","['Department of Physiology, Institute of Basic Medical Sciences, University of Oslo, Oslo, Norway.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (RNA, Catalytic)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Chronic/*genetics', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'RNA, Catalytic/*genetics', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/*genetics']",1998/12/03 00:00,1998/12/03 00:01,['1998/12/03 00:00'],"['1998/12/03 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/12/03 00:01 [medline]', '1998/12/03 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)57759-8 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1998 Dec 1;92(11):4263-8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Because partial sequencing of one of the subunits of the NS protease revealed homology to the proteasome, we tested the effects of classical proteasome inhibitors on apoptosis in CLL cells. Here we report that proteasome inhibition caused high levels of DNA fragmentation in all patients analyzed, including those resistant to glucocorticoids or nucleoside analogs, in vitro. Proteasome inhibitor-induced DNA fragmentation was associated with activation of caspase/ICE family cysteine protease(s) and was blocked by the caspase antagonist, zVADfmk. Analysis of the biochemical mechanisms involved showed that proteasome inhibition resulted in mitochondrial dysregulation leading to the release of cytochrome c and a drop in mitochondrial transmembrane potential (triangle upPsi). These changes were associated with inhibition of NFkappaB, a proteasome-regulated transcription factor that has been implicated in the suppression of apoptosis in other systems. Together, our results suggest that drugs that target the proteasome might be capable of bypassing resistance to conventional chemotherapy in CLL.","['Chandra, J', 'Niemer, I', 'Gilbreath, J', 'Kliche, K O', 'Andreeff, M', 'Freireich, E J', 'Keating, M', 'McConkey, D J']","['Chandra J', 'Niemer I', 'Gilbreath J', 'Kliche KO', 'Andreeff M', 'Freireich EJ', 'Keating M', 'McConkey DJ']","['Departments of Cell Biology and Hematology, The University of Texas, M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Cysteine Proteinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Glucocorticoids)', '0 (Multienzyme Complexes)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Cysteine Endopeptidases)', 'EC 3.4.25.1 (Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Cysteine Endopeptidases/*drug effects', 'Cysteine Proteinase Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Glucocorticoids/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Intracellular Membranes/drug effects', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/drug therapy/*pathology', 'Lymphocyte Activation/drug effects', 'Lymphocytes/pathology', 'Multienzyme Complexes/*drug effects', 'Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex']",1998/12/03 00:00,1998/12/03 00:01,['1998/12/03 00:00'],"['1998/12/03 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/12/03 00:01 [medline]', '1998/12/03 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)57754-9 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1998 Dec 1;92(11):4220-9.,"['CA16672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA49639/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA55164/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Using polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based minimal residual disease (MRD) analysis, we have investigated retrospectively the impact of submicroscopic leukemia on outcome in 64 patients receiving allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (BMT) for childhood ALL. Remission BM specimens were taken 6 to 81 days (median, 23) before transplant. All patients received similar conditioning therapy; 50 received grafts from unrelated donors and 14 from related donors. Nineteen patients were transplanted in first complete remission (CR1) and 45 in second or subsequent CR. MRD was analyzed by PCR of Ig or T-cell receptor delta or gamma rearrangements, electrophoresis, and allele-specific oligoprobing. Samples were rated high-level positive (clonal band evident after electrophoresis; sensitivity 10(-2) to 10(-3)), low-level positive (MRD detected only after oligoprobing; sensitivity 10(-3) to 10(-5)), or negative. Excluding 8 patients transplanted in CR2 for isolated extramedullary relapse (all MRD-), MRD was detected at high level in 12 patients, low level in 11, and was undetectable in 33. Two-year event-free survival for these groups was 0%, 36%, and 73%, respectively (P <.001). Follow-up in patients remaining in continuing remission is 20 to 96 months (median, 35). These results suggest that MRD analysis could be used routinely in this setting. This would allow identification of patients with resistant leukemia (who may benefit from innovative BMT protocols) and of those with more responsive disease (who may be candidates for randomized trials of BMT versus modern intensive relapse chemotherapy).","['Knechtli, C J', 'Goulden, N J', 'Hancock, J P', 'Grandage, V L', 'Harris, E L', 'Garland, R J', 'Jones, C G', 'Rowbottom, A W', 'Hunt, L P', 'Green, A F', 'Clarke, E', 'Lankester, A W', 'Cornish, J M', 'Pamphilon, D H', 'Steward, C G', 'Oakhill, A']","['Knechtli CJ', 'Goulden NJ', 'Hancock JP', 'Grandage VL', 'Harris EL', 'Garland RJ', 'Jones CG', 'Rowbottom AW', 'Hunt LP', 'Green AF', 'Clarke E', 'Lankester AW', 'Cornish JM', 'Pamphilon DH', 'Steward CG', 'Oakhill A']","['Department of Pathology and Microbiology, School of Medical Sciences, University of Bristol, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Neoplasm, Residual', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*pathology/*therapy', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'Prognosis', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Treatment Outcome']",1998/12/03 00:00,1998/12/03 00:01,['1998/12/03 00:00'],"['1998/12/03 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/12/03 00:01 [medline]', '1998/12/03 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)57738-0 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1998 Dec 1;92(11):4072-9.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The patients whose median age was 50.3 years (range, 9 to 70) were administered IFN- (5 million units/m2/d) subcutaneously. The IFN- dose was subsequently adjusted to maintain the white blood cell and platelet counts between 1.5 and 5 x 10(9)/L, 50 and 100 x 10(9)/L, respectively. At diagnosis, the Sokal score was used to classify the patients into three groups: low (n = 57), intermediate (n = 42), and high risk (n = 16). A complete hematological response (CHR) was achieved in 93 cases (80.2%). Of the 116 patients, 113 were available for cytogenetic evaluation. Fifty patients (43%) achieved a major cytogenetic response (MCR) (=65% marrow Ph- cells), 37 of them having a complete cytogenetic response (CCR). The estimated 5-year survival of the 116 patients was 68% +/- 11% (95% confidence interval [CI]) with a median follow-up of 42 months (range, 3 to 114) and 85% +/- 11% (95% CI) with a median follow-up of 30.9 (range, 3 to 111) when patients were censored at the time of transplantation. Event-free survival at 5 years (adding death and transplant as event) was 46% +/- 11% (95% CI). Using proportional hazards regression to study time-dependent variables, we confirmed that the most significant factor associated with survival was the cytogenetic response (MCR or CCR) (P <.0001). This factor was independent compared with the Sokal score and baseline variables used to calculate the Sokal score. Moreover, using either univariate or multivariate analysis, the achievement of CHR within 3 months was strongly correlated with MCR (P <.0001). Minimum cytogenetic response (mCR, ie, at least 5% of Ph- metaphases) at 3 months was also a significant predictive factor for MCR (P <.0001). These results show that IFN- can induce a high rate of hematological and cytogenetic response when administered in doses leading to myelosuppression. Factors such as the achievement of CHR and mCR within 3 months could be useful to identify early those patients who will not respond to IFN- and who need alternative treatments such as stem cell transplantation.","['Mahon, F X', 'Faberes, C', 'Pueyo, S', 'Cony-Makhoul, P', 'Salmi, R', 'Boiron, J M', 'Marit, G', 'Bilhou-Nabera, C', 'Carrere, A', 'Montastruc, M', 'Pigneux, A', 'Bernard, P', 'Reiffers, J']","['Mahon FX', 'Faberes C', 'Pueyo S', 'Cony-Makhoul P', 'Salmi R', 'Boiron JM', 'Marit G', 'Bilhou-Nabera C', 'Carrere A', 'Montastruc M', 'Pigneux A', 'Bernard P', 'Reiffers J']","['Service des Maladies du Sang, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de Bordeaux, Hopital Haut-Leveque, Pessac, France.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article']",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Interferon Type I)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)']",IM,"['Administration, Cutaneous', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Child', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Interferon Type I/*administration & dosage', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/mortality/*physiopathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'Prognosis', 'Recombinant Proteins', 'Survival Analysis', 'Time Factors']",1998/12/03 00:00,1998/12/03 00:01,['1998/12/03 00:00'],"['1998/12/03 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/12/03 00:01 [medline]', '1998/12/03 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)57736-7 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1998 Dec 1;92(11):4059-65.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, there are growing concerns about the intensive resources required for this procedure given health care budget constraints. To address this issue, we conducted a study of the costs and cost-effectiveness of unrelated donor transplantation for chronic phase CML. The costs of transplantation were derived from 157 patients from the Brigham and Women's Hospital (BWH) and the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center (FHCRC). Estimates of the effectiveness of transplantation were taken from our previous work using data from the International Bone Marrow Transplant Registry and the National Marrow Donor Program. The median cost of the first 6 months of care including donor identification, marrow collection, patient hospitalization for transplantation and all outpatient medications and readmissions through 6 months postmarrow infusion was $178,500 (range, $85,000 to $462,400) and the mean was $196,200. Mean costs for patients surviving beyond 6 months posttransplant were significantly lower than for patients dying within that period ($189,700 v $211,000, respectively, P =.03). Posttransplant follow-up costs were high for months 6 to 18, then decreased. The incremental cost-effectiveness of transplantation within 1 year of diagnosis versus -interferon therapy without transplant in the base case of a 35-year-old patient was $51,800/quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained. Sensitivity analysis showed that most ratios were between $50,000 to $100, 000/QALY or within the intermediate zone of acceptable cost-effectiveness ratios.","['Lee, S J', 'Anasetti, C', 'Kuntz, K M', 'Patten, J', 'Antin, J H', 'Weeks, J C']","['Lee SJ', 'Anasetti C', 'Kuntz KM', 'Patten J', 'Antin JH', 'Weeks JC']","[""Department of Adult Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and the Department of Medicine, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/*economics', 'Child', 'Cost-Benefit Analysis', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*economics/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",1998/12/03 00:00,1998/12/03 00:01,['1998/12/03 00:00'],"['1998/12/03 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/12/03 00:01 [medline]', '1998/12/03 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)57734-3 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1998 Dec 1;92(11):4047-52.,['CA75267-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The Japanese Cooperative Study Group of PBSCT.,4040-6,"In this prospective trial, a total of 74 children who were scheduled to undergo high-dose chemotherapy followed by autologous peripheral blood stem cell transplantation (PBSCT) were prospectively randomized at diagnosis to evaluate the effectiveness of exogenous granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) treatment in accelerating hematopoietic recovery after PBSCT. The diagnosis included acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) (n = 27), neuroblastoma (n = 29), and miscellaneous solid tumors (n = 18). Eligibility criteria included (1) primary PBSCT, (2) chemotherapy-responsive disease, and (3) collected cell number >1 x 10(5) colony-forming unit-granulocyte-macrophage (CFU-GM)/kg and >1 x 10(6) CD34(+) cells/kg patient's body weight. After applying the above criteria, 11 patients were excluded due to disease progression before PBSCT (n = 6) or a low number of harvested cells (n = 5), leaving 63 patients for analysis; 32 patients in the treatment group (300 microg/m2 of G-CSF intravenously over 1 hour from day 1 of PBSCT) and 31 in the control group without treatment. Two distinct disease-oriented high-dose regimens without total body irradiation consisted of the MCVAC regimen using ranimustine (MCNU, 450 mg/m2), cytosine arabinoside (16 g/m2), etoposide (1.6 g/m2), and cyclophosphamide (100 mg/kg) for patients with ALL, and the Hi-MEC regimen using melphalan (180 mg/m2), etoposide (1.6 g/m2), and carboplatinum (1.6 g/m2) for those with solid tumors. Five patients (two in the treatment group and three in the control group) were subsequently removed due to protocol violations. All patients survived PBSCT. The median numbers of transfused mononuclear cells (MNC), CD34(+) cells, and CFU-GM were, respectively, 4.5 (range, 1 to 19) x 10(8)/kg, 8.0 (1.1 to 25) x 10(6)/kg, and 3.7 (1.2 to 23) x 10(5)/kg in the treatment group (n = 30) and 2.9 (0.8 to 21) x 10(8)/kg, 6.3 (1.1 to 34) x 10(6)/kg, and 5.5 (1.3 to 37) x 10(5)/kg, respectively, in the control group (n = 28), with no significant difference. After PBSCT, the time to achieve an absolute neutrophil count (ANC) of >0.5 x 10(9)/L in the treatment group was less than that in the control group (median, 11 v 12 days; the log-rank test, P =.046), although the last day of red blood cell (RBC) transfusion (day 11 v day 10) and the duration of febrile days (>38 degrees C) after PBSCT (4 v 4 days) were identical in both groups. However, platelet recovery to >20 x 10(9)/L was significantly longer in treatment group than control group (26 v 16 days; P =.009) and >50 x 10(9)/L tended to take longer in the treatment group (29 v 26 days; P =.126), with significantly more platelet transfusion-dependent days (27 v 13 days; t-test, P =.037). When patients were divided into two different disease cohorts, ALL patients showed no difference in engraftment kinetics between the G-CSF treatment and control groups, while differences were seen in those with solid tumors. We concluded that the marginal clinical benefit of 1 day earlier recovery of granulocytes could be offset by the delayed recovery of platelets. We recommend that the routine application of costly G-CSF therapy in children undergoing PBSCT should be seriously reconsidered.","['Kawano, Y', 'Takaue, Y', 'Mimaya, J', 'Horikoshi, Y', 'Watanabe, T', 'Abe, T', 'Shimizu, Y', 'Matsushita, T', 'Kikuta, A', 'Watanabe, A', 'Iwai, A', 'Ito, E', 'Endo, M', 'Kodani, N', 'Ohta, S', 'Gushi, K', 'Azuma, H', 'Etoh, T', 'Okamoto, Y', 'Amano, K', 'Hattori, H', 'Eguchi, H', 'Kuroda, Y']","['Kawano Y', 'Takaue Y', 'Mimaya J', 'Horikoshi Y', 'Watanabe T', 'Abe T', 'Shimizu Y', 'Matsushita T', 'Kikuta A', 'Watanabe A', 'Iwai A', 'Ito E', 'Endo M', 'Kodani N', 'Ohta S', 'Gushi K', 'Azuma H', 'Etoh T', 'Okamoto Y', 'Amano K', 'Hattori H', 'Eguchi H', 'Kuroda Y']","['Department of Pediatrics, University Hospital of Tokushima, Tokushima; Stem Cell Transplant Unit, National Cancer Center Hospital, Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,['143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Female', 'Graft Survival', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/*administration & dosage/adverse effects', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/*therapy', 'Prospective Studies', 'Transplantation, Autologous', 'Treatment Outcome']",1998/12/03 00:00,1998/12/03 00:01,['1998/12/03 00:00'],"['1998/12/03 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/12/03 00:01 [medline]', '1998/12/03 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)57733-1 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1998 Dec 1;92(11):4040-6.,,['Blood. 1999 May 15;93(10):3565-6.

The association of -7/7q- with myeloid leukemia suggests that these regions contain novel tumor suppressor gene(s), whose loss of function contribute to leukemic transformation or tumor progression. Based on chromosome banding analysis, two critical regions have been identified, one in band q22 and another in bands q32-q35. Presently there are no data available on the molecular delineation of the distal critical region. In this study we analyzed bone marrow and blood samples from 13 patients with myeloid leukemia (de novo myelodysplastic syndrome [MDS], n = 3; de novo acute myeloid leukemia [AML], n = 9; therapy-related (t-) AML, n = 1) which, on chromosome banding analysis, exhibited deletions (n = 12) or in one case a balanced translocation involving bands 7q31-qter using fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). As probes we used representative clones from a contig map of yeast artificial chromosome (YAC) clones that spans chromosome bands 7q31.1-qter. In the 12 cases with loss of 7q material, we identified a commonly deleted region of approximately 4 to 5 megabasepairs in size encompassing the distal part of 7q35 and the proximal part of 7q36. Furthermore, the breakpoint of the reciprocal translocation from the patient with t-AML was localized to a 1,300-kb sized YAC clone that maps to the proximal boundary of the commonly deleted region. Interestingly, in this case both homologs of chromosome 7 were affected: one was lost (-7) and the second exhibited the t(7q35). The identification and delineation of translocation and deletion breakpoints provides the first step toward the identification of the gene(s) involved in the pathogenesis of 7q35-q36 aberrations in myeloid disorders.","['Dohner, K', 'Brown, J', 'Hehmann, U', 'Hetzel, C', 'Stewart, J', 'Lowther, G', 'Scholl, C', 'Frohling, S', 'Cuneo, A', 'Tsui, L C', 'Lichter, P', 'Scherer, S W', 'Dohner, H']","['Dohner K', 'Brown J', 'Hehmann U', 'Hetzel C', 'Stewart J', 'Lowther G', 'Scholl C', 'Frohling S', 'Cuneo A', 'Tsui LC', 'Lichter P', 'Scherer SW', 'Dohner H']","['Medizinische Klinik and Poliklinik V, University of Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,['0 (Genetic Markers)'],IM,"['Chromosome Mapping', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 7', 'Genes, Tumor Suppressor', '*Genetic Markers', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*genetics', '*Sequence Deletion']",1998/12/03 00:00,1998/12/03 00:01,['1998/12/03 00:00'],"['1998/12/03 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/12/03 00:01 [medline]', '1998/12/03 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)57731-8 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1998 Dec 1;92(11):4031-5.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Infectious MFG-EGFP virus was produced by an amphotropic virus producer cell line (GP+envAm12). SF-EGFP was produced in the PG13 cell line pseudotyped for the gibbon ape leukemia virus (GaLV) envelope proteins. Using a 2-day growth factor prestimulation, followed by a 2-day, fibronectin fragment CH-296-supported transduction, CD34(+) and CD34(+)CD38(-) UCB subsets were efficiently transduced using either vector. The use of the SF-EGFP/PG13 retroviral packaging cell combination consistently resulted in twofold higher levels of EGFP-expressing cells than the MFG-EGFP/Am12 combination. Transplantation of 10(5) input equivalent transduced CD34(+) or 5 x 10(3) input equivalent CD34(+)CD38(-) UCB cells in nonobese diabetic/severe combined immunodeficient (NOD/SCID) mice resulted in median engraftment percentages of 8% and 5%, respectively, which showed that the in vivo repopulating ability of the cells had been retained. In addition, mice engrafted after transplantation of transduced CD34(+) cells using the MFG-EGFP/Am12 or the SF-EGFP/PG13 combination expressed EGFP with median values of 2% and 23% of human CD45(+) cells, respectively, which showed that the NOD/SCID repopulating cells were successfully transduced. EGFP+ cells were found in all human hematopoietic lineages produced in NOD/SCID mice including human progenitors with in vitro clonogenic ability. EGFP-expressing cells were also detected in the human cobblestone area-forming cell (CAFC) assay at 2 to 6 weeks of culture on the murine stromal cell line FBMD-1. During the transduction procedure the absolute numbers of CAFC week 6 increased 5- to 10-fold. The transduction efficiency of this progenitor cell subset was similar to the fraction of EGFP+ human cells in the bone marrow of the NOD/SCID mice transplanted with MFG-EGFP/Am12 or SF-EGFP/PG13 transduced CD34(+) cells, ie, 6% and 27%, respectively. The study thus shows that purified CD34(+) and highly purified CD34(+)CD38(-) UCB cells can be transduced efficiently with preservation of repopulating ability. The SF-EGFP/PG13 vector/packaging cell combination was much more effective in transducing repopulating cells than the MFG-EGFP/Am12 combination.","['van Hennik, P B', 'Verstegen, M M', 'Bierhuizen, M F', 'Limon, A', 'Wognum, A W', 'Cancelas, J A', 'Barquinero, J', 'Ploemacher, R E', 'Wagemaker, G']","['van Hennik PB', 'Verstegen MM', 'Bierhuizen MF', 'Limon A', 'Wognum AW', 'Cancelas JA', 'Barquinero J', 'Ploemacher RE', 'Wagemaker G']","['Institute of Hematology, Erasmus University Rotterdam, The Netherlands; and the Department of Cryobiology and Cell Therapy, Institut de Recerca Oncologica, Barcelona, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Luminescent Proteins)', '147336-22-9 (Green Fluorescent Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay/methods', 'Fetal Blood/cytology', '*Gene Transfer Techniques', 'Graft Survival', 'Green Fluorescent Proteins', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Luminescent Proteins/*genetics', 'Mice', 'Mice, SCID']",1998/12/03 00:00,1998/12/03 00:01,['1998/12/03 00:00'],"['1998/12/03 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/12/03 00:01 [medline]', '1998/12/03 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)57729-X [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1998 Dec 1;92(11):4013-22.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here we show that AML1/Evi-1 represses growth-inhibitory signaling by transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) in 32Dcl3 myeloid cells. The activity of AML1/Evi-1 to repress TGF-beta signaling depends on the two separate regions of the Evi-1 portion, one of which is the first zinc finger domain. AML1/Evi-1 interacts with Smad3, an intracellular mediator of TGF-beta signaling, through the first zinc finger domain, and represses the Smad3 activity, as Evi-1 does. We also show that suppression of endogenous Evi-1 in leukemic cells carrying inv(3) restores TGF-beta responsiveness. Taken together, AML1/Evi-1 acts as an inhibitor of TGF-beta signaling by interfering with Smad3 through the Evi-1 portion, and both AML1/Evi-1 and Evi-1 repress TGF-beta-mediated growth suppression in hematopoietic cells. Thus, AML1/Evi-1 may contribute to leukemogenesis by specifically blocking growth-inhibitory signaling of TGF-beta in the t(3;21) leukemia.","['Kurokawa, M', 'Mitani, K', 'Imai, Y', 'Ogawa, S', 'Yazaki, Y', 'Hirai, H']","['Kurokawa M', 'Mitani K', 'Imai Y', 'Ogawa S', 'Yazaki Y', 'Hirai H']","['Department of Hematology & Oncology, Graduate School of Medicine, University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (MDS1 and EVI1 Complex Locus Protein)', '0 (MECOM protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (RUNX1 protein, human)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (SMAD3 protein, human)', '0 (Smad3 Protein)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Transforming Growth Factor beta)']",IM,"['Animals', 'COS Cells', 'Cell Division/drug effects/genetics', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 21', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 3', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*genetics/pathology', 'MDS1 and EVI1 Complex Locus Protein', '*Proto-Oncogene Proteins', '*Proto-Oncogenes', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/*genetics', 'Smad3 Protein', 'Trans-Activators/*genetics', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics', 'Transfection', 'Transforming Growth Factor beta/*pharmacology', 'Translocation, Genetic']",1998/12/03 00:00,1998/12/03 00:01,['1998/12/03 00:00'],"['1998/12/03 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/12/03 00:01 [medline]', '1998/12/03 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)57728-8 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1998 Dec 1;92(11):4003-12.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The findings emphasize that Flavimonas oryzihabitans should be included in the list of pathogens that cause community-acquired infections in the immunocompromised host.","['Giacometti, A', 'Cirioni, O', 'Quarta, M', 'Schimizzi, A M', 'Del Prete, M S', 'Scalise, G']","['Giacometti A', 'Cirioni O', 'Quarta M', 'Schimizzi AM', 'Del Prete MS', 'Scalise G']","['Institute of Infectious Diseases and Public Health, University of Ancona, Azienda Ospedaliera Umberto I, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",Germany,Eur J Clin Microbiol Infect Dis,European journal of clinical microbiology & infectious diseases : official publication of the European Society of Clinical Microbiology,8804297,['0 (Anti-Bacterial Agents)'],IM,"['AIDS-Related Opportunistic Infections/microbiology', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents/pharmacology', 'Bacteremia/*microbiology', 'Community-Acquired Infections', 'Cross Infection/microbiology', 'Female', 'Gram-Negative Aerobic Rods and Cocci/drug effects/*isolation & purification', 'Gram-Negative Bacterial Infections/*microbiology', 'Humans', 'Immunocompromised Host', 'Male', 'Microbial Sensitivity Tests', 'Opportunistic Infections/*microbiology', 'Pneumonia, Bacterial/*microbiology']",1998/12/01 00:00,1998/12/01 00:01,['1998/12/01 00:00'],"['1998/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1998/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF01708348 [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Clin Microbiol Infect Dis. 1998 Sep;17(9):645-8. doi: 10.1007/BF01708348.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

For these reasons, the in vitro induction of primary T lymphocyte responses remains a significant technical challenge. We have attempted to improve current strategies for generating in vitro responses by optimising (i) isolation and concomitant activation of DC from peripheral blood, (ii) uptake, processing and presentation of antigen by DC and (iii) antigen driven T lymphocyte proliferation. We established that RPMI 1640 media supplemented with 10% autologous serum resulted in the best yield of CMRF-44+, CD14-, CD19- DC after enrichment over a Nycodenz gradient. Optimal presentation of whole protein and peptide antigen was achieved by addition after the purification of the APC, i.e., at the start of the T lymphocyte proliferation assay. RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% autologous serum or plasma supported the best antigen driven specific T lymphocyte responses. Using these optimised conditions, we compared the efficacy of PBMC and purified blood DC for priming T lymphocyte responses to the chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) specific bcr-abl (b3a2) peptide. Peptide specific T lymphocyte responses were generated with both purified DC and whole PBMC, suggesting that T lymphocyte precursor frequency was the limiting factor in these experiments. These results will aid in the generation of human T lymphocyte lines to primary antigens, for in vitro and therapeutic applications.","['Mannering, S I', 'McKenzie, J L', 'Hart, D N']","['Mannering SI', 'McKenzie JL', 'Hart DN']","['Haematology/Immunology/Transfusion Medicine Research Group, Christchurch School of Medicine, New Zealand.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,J Immunol Methods,Journal of immunological methods,1305440,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Culture Media)', '0 (Enterotoxins)', '0 (Peptides)', '0 (Phytohemagglutinins)', '0 (Tetanus Toxoid)', '39424-53-8 (enterotoxin B, staphylococcal)', '4419T9MX03 (Iohexol)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Antigen Presentation/*immunology', 'Blood', 'Cell Culture Techniques/*methods', 'Cell Division', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Separation', 'Culture Media', 'Dendritic Cells/cytology/*immunology', 'Enterotoxins', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/immunology', 'Humans', 'Iohexol', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/cytology/immunology', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Peptides/immunology', 'Phytohemagglutinins', 'T-Lymphocytes/cytology/*immunology', 'Tetanus Toxoid/immunology']",1998/11/27 00:00,1998/11/27 00:01,['1998/11/27 00:00'],"['1998/11/27 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/11/27 00:01 [medline]', '1998/11/27 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0022-1759(98)00125-2 [pii]', '10.1016/s0022-1759(98)00125-2 [doi]']",ppublish,J Immunol Methods. 1998 Oct 1;219(1-2):69-83. doi: 10.1016/s0022-1759(98)00125-2.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Bioactivity may be decreased in settings where the target antigen exists in a soluble form capable of binding to circulating antibody. Because many antigens have soluble forms, we developed a method for determining if antibody is bound by soluble antigen in vivo. As a model system, we studied the interaction of soluble interleukin-2 receptor alpha (Tac; IL2R alpha; CD25) and anti-Tac antibody. We show first that HPLC readily separates free antibody from antibody which is monovalently or bivalently bound by soluble antigen. Further, we demonstrate that the distribution of the three forms of antibody accords with predictions of mass action and the binomial probability distribution. These methods were used to examine the bioactivity and concentration of free antibody in 14 patients undergoing therapeutic trial with Humanized anti-Tac antibody in leukemia and lymphoma. Results of two contrasting patients are highlighted. Low bioactivities correlated with reduced targeting of tumor cells and reduced therapeutic effectiveness.

Immunocytochemical staining techniques have led to improvements in the ability to detect occult cancer cells in bone marrow. One major limitation of these methods is that the monoclonal antibodies used are only tumour-associated and not tumour-specific. Therefore, some cross reaction with normal cells can occur. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) has been applied extensively to measure minimal residual disease in bone marrow and blood of lymphomas carrying the t(14;18) translocation and Philadelphia chromosome (PH)-positive chronic myelogenous leukaemia. One major limitation of the PCR method is that not all tumours of interest carry chromosomal translocation. Reverse transcription PCR assays (RT-PCR) that screen for expression of tissue-specific and tumour-associated genes mRNA in bone marrow and blood have been developed. As in the case of immunocytochemistry, not all RT-PCR assays have the specificity required for them to be used safely in the clinic.

In the past 10-15 years there has been significant progress in the field of systemic adjuvant therapy of breast cancer. It is now reliably established that the concept is valid; that is, that early treatment with either cytotoxic chemotherapy or endocrine therapy does result in improved survival compared with treatment deferred until relapse. Despite considerable progress, several controversial issues remain. These include the optimal timing and sequencing of treatment, optimal drug doses, and the role of new drugs such as taxanes and new endocrine agents. The identification of more powerful prognostic and/or predictive tests might have substantial clinical implications but major breakthroughs in this field of research are still to come. A relatively new and important issue in clinical decision-making regarding the use of different adjuvant therapies is long-term toxicity such as leukemia with some types of chemotherapy and endometrial cancer (and possibly other malignancies) with long-term tamoxifen.

MATERIAL: In vitro, lysate of rat basophilic leukemia cells, the microsome fraction of sheep seminal vesicles, human polymorphonuclear leukocytes, human synovial cells, and human monocytes. Ex vivo and in vivo, male Balb/c mice or SD rats. TREATMENT: In ex vivo study, ER-34122 (0.03-1 mg/kg) was orally administered 1 h before withdrawal of blood samples. In carrageenin-induced paw edema, ER-34122 (3-100 mg/kg) and indomethacin (1-10mg/kg) were orally administered 1 h before carrageenin injection. In arachidonic acid-induced ear inflammation, ER-34122 (0.3-10mg/kg), zileuton (10-100mg/kg) and indomethacin (0.3-3mg/kg) were orally administered 1 h before arachidonic acid application. METHODS: 5-Hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid and other eicosanoids were determined by using an HPLC method and enzyme immunoassay, respectively. Rat hind paw edema and mouse ear edema were assessed by measuring paw volume and ear thickness, respectively. Myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity and eicosanoid content of the ear tissue were also determined. RESULTS: ER-34122 inhibited both LOX and COX product generation in vitro, and ex vivo. ER-34122 and indomethacin inhibited carrageenin-induced paw edema formation. In the arachidonic acid-induced ear inflammation, ER-34122 inhibited inflammatory responses (edema formation and MPO accumulation) as well as eicosanoids (LTB4, LTC4 and PGE2) generation. A representative LOX inhibitor, zileuton, also inhibited these inflammatory responses, while a COX inhibitor, indomethacin, did not suppress them though it completely inhibited PGE2 generation. CONCLUSIONS: The anti-inflammatory characteristics of ER-34122 are considered to be superior to those of COX inhibitors such as indomethacin, because in addition to its inhibitory activity on the COX pathway, ER-34122 inhibits LOX products generation, as revealed by the inhibition of edema formation or polymorphonuclear leukocyte infiltration in the arachidonic acid-induced ear inflammation model.","['Horizoe, T', 'Nagakura, N', 'Chiba, K', 'Shirota, H', 'Shinoda, M', 'Kobayashi, N', 'Numata, H', 'Okamoto, Y', 'Kobayashi, S']","['Horizoe T', 'Nagakura N', 'Chiba K', 'Shirota H', 'Shinoda M', 'Kobayashi N', 'Numata H', 'Okamoto Y', 'Kobayashi S']","['Eisai Co., Ltd., Tsukuba Research Laboratories for Drug Discovery, Biology Unit 5, Ibaraki, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Switzerland,Inflamm Res,Inflammation research : official journal of the European Histamine Research Society ...

Previously, it was shown that LIF treatment of M1D+ cells leads to an increased expression of colony-stimulating factor (CSF) receptor mRNA encoded by c-fms. CSF-1, a macrophage growth factor, induces the survival, growth, and differentiation of mononuclear phagocytes but has not been implicated in the regulation of early myeloid cell differentiation. Here we show that low-dose LIF treatment of M1D+ cells results in CSF-1 secretion and CSF-1 receptor up-regulation. CSF-1, when applied alone, induces some M1D+ adherence and the up-regulation of lysozyme M, a macrophage-specific marker. Finally, we show that when applied together, LIF and CSF-1 act synergistically to induce macrophage morphology, phagocytosis, and the expression of the macrophage-specific markers CD11b/Mac-1 alpha chain, lysozyme M, FcgammaRII, and JE/MCP.1. These results indicate that instead of being part of exclusive pathways, as thought until this work, LIF and CSF-1 can function synergistically to further stimulate the early stages of myeloid differentiation.","['Aperlo, C', 'Sevilla, L', 'Guerin, S', 'Pognonec, P', 'Boulukos, K E']","['Aperlo C', 'Sevilla L', 'Guerin S', 'Pognonec P', 'Boulukos KE']","['Centre de Biochimie, Faculte des Sciences, Nice, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cell Growth Differ,Cell growth & differentiation : the molecular biology journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9100024,"['0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '81627-83-0 (Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor, Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Survival', 'Drug Synergism', 'Growth Inhibitors/*metabolism/pharmacology', '*Interleukin-6', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Lymphokines/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'Macrophages/*cytology/drug effects', 'Mice', 'Receptor, Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/genetics/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1998/11/27 00:00,1998/11/27 00:01,['1998/11/27 00:00'],"['1998/11/27 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/11/27 00:01 [medline]', '1998/11/27 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cell Growth Differ. 1998 Nov;9(11):929-37.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Therefore, we examined the usefulness of a paraffin section IHC panel consisting of antibodies to CD5, CD10, CD20, CD23, CD43, and cyclin D1. We tested 55 formalin-fixed small B-cell lymphomas, including 16 small lymphocytic lymphomas (SLLs), 10 mantle cell lymphomas (MCLs), 25 follicle center lymphomas (FCLs), and 4 mantle zone lymphomas (MZLs). Seventeen cases had B5-fixed sections that were stained in the same manner. The findings were correlated with FC immunophenotyping when available. All of the SLLs and 90% of the MCLs expressed CD5 by IHC, with occasional weak expression in some MCLs. All of the FCLs and MZLs lacked CD5 expression. These results were comparable to those obtained by FC. CD43 expression was seen in 100% of the SLLs, 90% of the MCLs, and 75% of the MZLs. CD23 expression was seen in 94% of the SLL; of these, 100% also showed expression of CD23 by FC. Cyclin D1 was detected in all of the MCLs by IHC but also in 3 of the 16 SLLs. CD23 was absent in all of the MCLs. CD10 expression was present in 21 (95%) of 22 FCLs. All of the 17 cases fixed in B5 showed a decreased immunoreactivity for CD5 in the neoplastic cells. In contrast, CD10 immunoreactivity was judged better in B5-fixed sections. We concluded, therefore, that anti-CD5 and -CD10 were useful tools in the differential diagnosis of B-cell lymphomas of small lymphocytes and that a paraffin-section IHC panel consisting of antibodies to CD5, CD10, CD20, CD23, CD43, and cyclin D1 was a useful ancillary technique that compared favorably with FC.","['de Leon, E D', 'Alkan, S', 'Huang, J C', 'Hsi, E D']","['de Leon ED', 'Alkan S', 'Huang JC', 'Hsi ED']","['Department of Pathology, Loyola University Medical Center, Maywood, Illinois, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Mod Pathol,"Modern pathology : an official journal of the United States and Canadian Academy of Pathology, Inc",8806605,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, CD20)', '0 (CD5 Antigens)', '0 (Fixatives)', '0 (Leukosialin)', '0 (Receptors, IgE)', '0 (SPN protein, human)', '0 (Sialoglycoproteins)', '136601-57-5 (Cyclin D1)', '1HG84L3525 (Formaldehyde)', 'EC 3.4.24.11 (Neprilysin)']",IM,"['*Antigens, CD', 'Antigens, CD20/biosynthesis', 'CD5 Antigens/biosynthesis', 'Cyclin D1/biosynthesis', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Fixatives', 'Formaldehyde', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/metabolism/*pathology', 'Leukosialin', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/metabolism/*pathology', 'Lymphoma, Follicular/metabolism/pathology', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/metabolism/*pathology', 'Neprilysin/biosynthesis', 'Paraffin Embedding', 'Receptors, IgE/biosynthesis', 'Sialoglycoproteins/biosynthesis']",1998/11/27 00:00,1998/11/27 00:01,['1998/11/27 00:00'],"['1998/11/27 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/11/27 00:01 [medline]', '1998/11/27 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Mod Pathol. 1998 Nov;11(11):1046-51.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Magnesium homeostasis was studied by the characterization of magnesium efflux, the identification of intracellular magnesium pools, and the regulation of intracellular ionized Mg2+. In both undifferentiated and neutrophyl-like HL-60 cells, magnesium efflux occurred via the Na-Mg antiporter which was inhibited by imipramine and stimulated by db cAMP and forskolin. Receptor-mediated signals such as ATP, IFN-alpha, or PGE1, which can trigger cAMP-dependent magnesium efflux, were ineffective in undifferentiated HL-60 cells but induced 60-70% increase of magnesium efflux in neutrophyl-like HL-60 cells. Selective membrane permeabilization by the cation ionophore A23187 induced a large magnesium release when cells were treated with rotenone. In both cell populations, the addition of glucose to rotenone-treated cells restored magnesium release to the control level. Permeabilization by 0.005% digitonin provoked the release of 90% cell total magnesium in both cell types. Intracellular [Mg2+]i was 0.15 and 0.26 mM in undifferentiated and neutrophyl-like HL-60 cells, respectively. Stimuli that triggered magnesium efflux, such as db cAMP in undifferentiated and IFN-alpha in neutrophyl-like HL-60 cells, induced a slow but consistent increase of [Mg2+]i which was independent from Ca2+ movements. Overall, these data indicate that magnesium homeostasis is regulated by receptor-mediated magnesium efflux which was modified during differentiation of HL-60 cells. Stimulation of magnesium efflux is paralleled by an increase of [Mg2+]i which reflects a release of magnesium from the bound cation pool.","['Wolf, F I', 'Covacci, V', 'Bruzzese, N', 'Di Francesco, A', 'Sacchetti, A', 'Corda, D', 'Cittadini, A']","['Wolf FI', 'Covacci V', 'Bruzzese N', 'Di Francesco A', 'Sacchetti A', 'Corda D', 'Cittadini A']","['Institute of General Pathology and Giovanni XXIII Cancer Research Center, Catholic University of Sacred Heart, Roma, Italy. ibipg@rm.unicatt.it']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Cell Biochem,Journal of cellular biochemistry,8205768,"['0 (Antiporters)', '0 (Interferon-alpha)', '0 (sodium-magnesium antiporter)', '03L9OT429T (Rotenone)', '1F7A44V6OU (Colforsin)', '27YG812J1I (Arachidonic Acid)', '37H9VM9WZL (Calcimycin)', '63X7MBT2LQ (Bucladesine)', '8L70Q75FXE (Adenosine Triphosphate)', 'F5TD010360 (Alprostadil)', 'I38ZP9992A (Magnesium)', 'KOO5CM684H (Digitonin)', 'N91BDP6H0X (Choline)', 'OGG85SX4E4 (Imipramine)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)', 'YOW8V9698H (Dimethyl Sulfoxide)']",IM,"['Adenosine Triphosphate/pharmacology', 'Alprostadil/pharmacology', 'Antiporters/agonists/antagonists & inhibitors/physiology', 'Arachidonic Acid/pharmacology', 'Bucladesine/pharmacology', 'Calcimycin/pharmacology', 'Calcium/metabolism', '*Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Membrane Permeability/drug effects', 'Choline/pharmacology', 'Colforsin/pharmacology', 'Digitonin/pharmacology', 'Dimethyl Sulfoxide/pharmacology', 'HL-60 Cells', '*Homeostasis/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Imipramine/pharmacology', 'Interferon-alpha/pharmacology', 'Magnesium/*metabolism', 'Neutrophils/*cytology/metabolism', 'Rotenone/pharmacology']",1998/11/27 03:02,2000/06/20 09:00,['1998/11/27 03:02'],"['1998/11/27 03:02 [pubmed]', '2000/06/20 09:00 [medline]', '1998/11/27 03:02 [entrez]']","['10.1002/(SICI)1097-4644(19981201)71:3<441::AID-JCB12>3.0.CO;2-O [pii]', '10.1002/(sici)1097-4644(19981201)71:3<441::aid-jcb12>3.0.co;2-o [doi]']",ppublish,J Cell Biochem. 1998 Dec 1;71(3):441-8. doi: 10.1002/(sici)1097-4644(19981201)71:3<441::aid-jcb12>3.0.co;2-o.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The aim of this article is to define a rational basis for a patient-oriented approach to treatment of MDS. EVIDENCE AND INFORMATION SOURCES: All four authors have done clinical studies of treatment of MDS, including stem cell transplantation, intensive and low-dose chemotherapy, and use of hematopoietic growth factors. They also participated in the Fourth international Symposium on MDS (Barcelona, 24-27 April 1997). In addition, the present review critically examines relevant articles and abstracts published in journals covered by the Science Citation Index and Medline. STATE OF THE ART AND PERSPECTIVES: At present, the only two treatments that can prolong survival are allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT) and intensive chemotherapy, but only a minority of MDS patients can really benefit from them. The heterogeneity of MDS patients, the wide variety of patient inclusion criteria and transplant procedures used, and relatively small numbers of patients in the individual reports of allogeneic SCT make it difficult to draw many definitive conclusions. However, approximately 40% of patients with MDS who are eligible for allogeneic SCT are likely to be cured by this treatment. Intensive chemotherapy with a combination of cytosine arabinoside and an anthracycline should be offered to all patients with an increase in bone marrow blasts who are not eligible for allogeneic SCT, especially those patients up to 65 years of age. Complete remission rates are similar to those obtained in patients with acute myelogenous leukemia, but probability of long-term survival is low. The remaining treatments validated in clinical trials (erythropoietin and/or granulocyte colony-stimulating factor, low-dose cytosine arabinoside) can improve the efficiency of hematopoiesis in subsets of patients. Responsive individuals might experience an improvement in quality of life but very few studies have addressed this question so far. The majority of MDS patients still rely upon supportive therapy. A clinical decision path based on findings of clinical trials and the patient's expectations can help physicians in decision making. Because of the inadequacies of all current treatment modalities, participation in clinical trials should always be encouraged.","['Cazzola, M', 'Anderson, J E', 'Ganser, A', 'Hellstrom-Lindberg, E']","['Cazzola M', 'Anderson JE', 'Ganser A', 'Hellstrom-Lindberg E']","['Department of Internal Medicine and Medical Therapy, University of Pavia School of Medicine, IRCCS Policlinico S.

The second objective was to verify whether high-dose therapy with autologous stem cells rescue followed by allografting conditioned by only an immunosuppressive regimen, can be combined in order to achieve the reduction of tumor burden after autografting and the control of residual disease with immune-mediated effects after allografting. DESIGN AND METHODS: To enter the pilot study the patients had to fulfil the following criteria: advanced resistant disease, presence of an HLA matched sibling donor, no general contraindications to stem cell transplantation. Our data refers to 9 patients: Hodgkin's disease (n = 4), non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (n = 2), advanced chronic myelogenous leukemia (n = 2) (one patient with accelerated phase Ph-negative but p190 BCR-ABL gene positive by RT-PCR and one with Ph-positive blastic phase), refractory anemia with excess of blasts t(1;3) (p36;q21) (n = 1). All patients but one received the combined approach. At a median of 40 days (range 30-96), after high-dose therapy and autologous stem cell engraftment, the patients were treated with immunosuppressive therapy consisting of fludarabine and cyclophosphamide (Flu-Cy protocol) and then HLA matched donor mobilized stem cells were infused into the patients. GvHD prophylaxis consisted of cyclosporin and methotrexate. RESULTS: To date, with a median observation period of 4 months (range, 2-10), complete chimerism (100% donor cells) has been achieved in 6 patients. Three patients did not achieve complete chimerism: one patient died of progressive Hodgkin's disease when he reached 55% of donor cells, another patient is now in increasing phase of donor cell engraftment and the last patient (blastic phase-CML) was the only case who appears to have had autologous recovery. Two of the Hodgkin's disease patients, who were in partial remission after autografting, achieved complete remission after allografting and both are disease free 2 and 6 months after. Another Hodgkin's disease patient is alive at 10 months but she has progressive disease. One of the two patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, who achieved partial remission after autografting, obtained complete remission and he is disease free 2 months after allografting. The other patient maintains partial remission obtained after autografting. The accelerated phase-CML patient obtained hematologic and molecular remission; the RAEB patient achieved hematologic and cytogenetic remission. In two patients severe aGVHD (grade II-III) was the single major complication but neither patient died of it. Mild aGVHD was seen in another patient. In only one patient did the ANC decrease to below 1 x 10(9)/L and in no case did platelets decrease below 20 x 10(9)/L. No patients required a sterile room or any red cell or platelet transfusions. INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: Immunosuppressive therapy with a Flu-Cy protocol allowed engraftment of HLA-matched sibling donor stem cells without procedure-related deaths; moreover, we have demonstrated that this combined procedure can be pursued in safety in a serious ill population and some of these patients achieved a complete remission. This procedure is not likely to be curative, but a fascinating step along the path to curing these diseases. Of course, the follow-up is too short to document the incidence of cGvHD.","['Carella, A M', 'Lerma, E', 'Dejana, A', 'Corsetti, M T', 'Celesti, L', 'Bruni, R', 'Benvenuto, F', 'Figari, O', 'Parodi, C', 'Carlier, P', 'Florio, G', 'Lercari, G', 'Valbonesi, M', 'Casarino, L', 'De Stefano, F', 'Geniram, A', 'Venturino, M', 'Tedeschi, L', 'Palmieri, G', 'Piaggio, G', 'Podesta, M', 'Frassoni, F', 'Van Lint, M T', 'Marmont, A M', 'Bacigalupo, A']","['Carella AM', 'Lerma E', 'Dejana A', 'Corsetti MT', 'Celesti L', 'Bruni R', 'Benvenuto F', 'Figari O', 'Parodi C', 'Carlier P', 'Florio G', 'Lercari G', 'Valbonesi M', 'Casarino L', 'De Stefano F', 'Geniram A', 'Venturino M', 'Tedeschi L', 'Palmieri G', 'Piaggio G', 'Podesta M', 'Frassoni F', 'Van Lint MT', 'Marmont AM', 'Bacigalupo A']","['N.O.A., Hematology/ABMT, Division of Hematology II, Ospedale S.

The goal of this study is to describe long term results of HSCT in high risk ALL patients. DESIGN AND METHODS: Between 1978 and 1996, 170 patient with ALL and a median age of 22 years (1-49), underwent an allogeneic HSCT from HLA-identical siblings (n = 149), family mismatched donors (n = 18) or unrelated HLA matched donors (n = 3); 92% of patients had at least one adverse prognostic factor for high risk ALL at diagnosis; one third (33%) were in first remission (CR1) and the majority (85%) received an unmanipulated HSCT with cyclosporin-methotrexate prophylaxis of graft-versus-host disease (GvHD). RESULTS: After a median follow-up of over 6 years, 59 patients are alive and 111 patients have died of leukemia (46%) or transplant related complications (54%). The actuarial 10 year survival is 53%, 38% and 20%, for patients in CR1, CR2 or advanced phase, respectively. The actuarial survival of patients with (n = 24) of without (n = 46) cytogenetic abnormalities, grafted in CR1/CR2 was respectively 45% and 48% (p = 0.5). The year of transplant had a significant impact in multivariate analysis on transplant related mortality (TRM) (p = 0.0009) but not on relapse (p = 0.3). Chronic GvHD was the most important favorable prognostic factor for survival (p = 0.0014) and relapse (p = 0.0019). INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: This study confirms that long term survival can be achieved with HSCT in ALL patients, even those with cytogenetic abnormalities. Transplant mortality has been significantly reduced in recent years, whereas leukemia rate relapse has remained unchanged: the latter is influenced by the occurrence of chronic GvHD. Immune intervention post-HSCT may be considered to address this problem.","['Zikos, P', 'Van Lint, M T', 'Lamparelli, T', 'Gualandi, F', 'Occhini, D', 'Bregante, S', 'Berisso, G', 'Mordini, N', 'Incagliato, M', 'Fugazza, G', 'Sessarego, M', 'Bacigalupo, A']","['Zikos P', 'Van Lint MT', 'Lamparelli T', 'Gualandi F', 'Occhini D', 'Bregante S', 'Berisso G', 'Mordini N', 'Incagliato M', 'Fugazza G', 'Sessarego M', 'Bacigalupo A']","['Divisione Ematologia Il, Ospedale San Martino, Genoa, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,,IM,"['Adult', 'Female', '*Graft vs Host Disease/etiology', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/adverse effects', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/mortality/*pathology/*therapy', 'Recurrence', 'Survival Analysis', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",1998/11/27 00:00,1998/11/27 00:01,['1998/11/27 00:00'],"['1998/11/27 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/11/27 00:01 [medline]', '1998/11/27 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Haematologica. 1998 Oct;83(10):896-903.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Three reports of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) studied by CGH have been published so far, with somewhat discrepant results. In the present study we performed CGH analysis on 36 patients with childhood ALL. The results were compared to those reported earlier on 157 cases. DESIGN AND METHODS: DNA was extracted from bone marrow specimens from 36 patients with childhood ALL. The tumor and reference DNAs were labeled with fluorescein-isothiocyanate conjugated dCTP and dUTP, and Texas red-conjugated dCTP and dUTP. The hybridizations were analyzed using the ISIS digital image analysis system. RESULTS: The most commonly gained chromosomes were X (42%), 4 (31%), 6 (31%), 10 (36%), 14 (28%) and 18 (33%), and the most common losses were at 9p22-pter (6%) and 12p13-pter (14%). INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: The pattern of gains of DNA sequences was very similar in the four reports, but the 9p and 12p deletions were observed only in the present study and one previous report. Our review of the results of 193 patients studied so far shows that the success rate using CGH was close to 100%, whereas cytogenetic analysis failed to reveal any information in 21 patients (11%). Furthermore, in 69 (36%) out of 193 patients CGH gave additional information to the banding analysis. CGH should, therefore, be used to supplement standard cytogenetics in the analysis of childhood ALL patients.","['Larramendy, M L', 'Huhta, T', 'Heinonen, K', 'Vettenranta, K', 'Mahlamaki, E', 'Riikonen, P', 'Saarinen-Pihkala, U M', 'Knuutila, S']","['Larramendy ML', 'Huhta T', 'Heinonen K', 'Vettenranta K', 'Mahlamaki E', 'Riikonen P', 'Saarinen-Pihkala UM', 'Knuutila S']","['Department of Medical Genetics, Haartman Institute, University of Helsinki, Finland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,['9007-49-2 (DNA)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 12', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 9', 'DNA/analysis/*genetics', 'Female', '*Gene Amplification', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics', '*Sequence Deletion', '*X Chromosome']",1998/11/27 00:00,1998/11/27 00:01,['1998/11/27 00:00'],"['1998/11/27 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/11/27 00:01 [medline]', '1998/11/27 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Haematologica. 1998 Oct;83(10):890-5.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A Southwest Oncology Group seven-arm phase II trial suggested that infusional 5-FU produced the most favorable toxicity spectrum and the longest survival, warranting further investigation in phase III trials. In a randomized phase III five-arm trial conducted by the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group and the Cancer and Leukemia Group B, significant toxicity differences noted among the arms favored high-dose infusional 5-FU. In addition, the trial showed that 5-FU modulated by leucovorin or interferon was not more effective than 5-FU given as a 24-hour high-dose infusion weekly, and N-(phosphonacetyl)-L-aspartic acid did not enhance the activity of the weekly infusional 5-FU. Oral leucovorin provided no advantage over IV dosing. There was a significant difference in survival for patients with nonmeasurable disease (16.9 months) compared to those with measurable disease (12.6 months, P = .001). The Advanced Colorectal Cancer Meta-analysis Project demonstrated a response advantage for patients receiving 5-FU plus leucovorin (23%) compared to those receiving bolus 5-FU (11%, P = 10(-7); however, there was no survival advantage of 5-FU plus leucovorin over 5-FU alone (P = 0.57). The Meta-Analysis Group in Cancer showed that continuous-infusion 5-FU resulted in a statistically significantly higher response rate than bolus 5-FU (22% vs 14%, P = .0002). Overall survival also favored continuous-infusion 5-FU (P = .04). Continuous-infusion 5-FU was less toxic than bolus treatment. Data from six select randomized trials comparing hepatic intra-arterial infusion of FUDR to systemic therapy demonstrated a significant difference favoring intra-arterial therapy.

Three months later, elimination of HBe Ag and HBV DNA and seroconversion from HBe Ag to HBe Ab occurred. The duration of alpha-IFN therapy was prolonged to 18 months, since other chemotherapeutic agents caused hepatotoxicity whenever they were tried and alpha-IFN treatment can be used in children with refractory T-cell leukemia in view of its antitumor effect.

In this study, the in vivo properties of anti-CD19 B43 monoclonal antibody and its derived single-chain Fv (FVS191) were studied in athymic nude mice bearing CD19-positive human lymphomas. B43 mab and FVS191 were labeled with iodine-125 using iodine-beads, and immunoreactivities were determined to be 57% and 72%, respectively. Scatchard analysis showed a similar high affinity for both. The results of pharmacokinetic studies revealed that FVS191 had a rapid biphasic clearance from the circulation (T1/2alpha=2.5 min, T1/2beta=3.7 h); The T1/2alpha and T1/2beta phases of B43 mab were determined to be 0.72 h and 57 h respectively. Biodistribution studies compared the uptake of labeled antibodies by CD19-positive and by CD19-negative tumors. The peak percentages of injected dose were 5.7% at 12 h for B43 and 2.45% at 1 h for FVS191. Radiolocalization indices (RI) demonstrated tumor-specific uptake for both, but higher uptake for B43. The optimal RI was seen at 15 min for FVS191 and 6 h for B43. FVS191 was unstable in vivo, approximately 50% of the injected dose being degraded in blood in 100 min. Radioactivity detected in the urine was present mainly as the deiodinized form of FVS191. The results suggest that B43 mab is favored over FVS191 in biodistribution properties and in vivo stability. Because B43 Mab showed early tumor-specific uptake, high RI values, and favorable tissue-to-blood ratios, it is a potential candidate for radioimmunotherapy and immunotoxin therapy of B-cell leukemia and lymphoma.","['Li, Q', 'Hudson, W', 'Wang, D', 'Berven, E', 'Uckun, F M', 'Kersey, J H']","['Li Q', 'Hudson W', 'Wang D', 'Berven E', 'Uckun FM', 'Kersey JH']","['Cancer Center, Department of Pediatrics and Laboratory Medicine/Pathology, University of Minnesota, 55455, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Germany,Cancer Immunol Immunother,"Cancer immunology, immunotherapy : CII",8605732,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, CD19)', '0 (Immunoconjugates)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Fragments)', '0 (immunoglobulin Fv)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/*pharmacokinetics', 'Antigens, CD19/*immunology', 'Drug Stability', 'Humans', 'Immunoconjugates/*pharmacokinetics', 'Immunoglobulin Fragments/*metabolism', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/*drug therapy', 'Mice', 'Mice, Nude', 'Neoplasms, Experimental/drug therapy', 'Tissue Distribution']",1998/11/26 00:00,1998/11/26 00:01,['1998/11/26 00:00'],"['1998/11/26 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/11/26 00:01 [medline]', '1998/11/26 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s002620050512 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Immunol Immunother. 1998 Nov;47(3):121-30. doi: 10.1007/s002620050512.,['CA 49721/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The cytotoxic activity of rhIL2-dependent cultured NK-92 cells against primary patient-derived leukemic target cells [12 acute myelogenous leukemias (AMLs), 7 T acute lymphoblastic leukemias (T-ALLs), 14 B-lineage-ALLs, and 13 chronic myelogenous leukemias (CMLs)], human leukemic cell lines (K562, KG1, HL60, Raji, NALM6, TALL-104, CEM-S, and CEM-T) and normal bone marrow cells was measured in 51Cr-release assay (CRA). The patient-derived leukemias could be subdivided into three groups based on their sensitivity to NK-92 cells: insensitive (< or =19% lysis), sensitive (20-49% lysis), and highly sensitive (> or =50% lysis) at an E:T ratio of 9:1. Of 46 patient-derived samples, 24 (52.2%) were sensitive or highly sensitive to NK-92-mediated in vitro cytotoxicity (6 of 12 AMLs, 7 of 7 T-ALLs, 5 of 14 B-lineage-ALLs, and 6 of 13 CMLs). NK-92 cells were highly cytotoxic against all of the eight leukemic cell lines tested in a standard 4-h CRA. Normal human bone marrow hematopoietic cells derived from 18 normal donors were insensitive to NK-92-mediated cytolysis. In comparison with human lymphokine-activated killer cells, normal NK cells, and T cells, NK-92 cells displayed more powerful antileukemia activity against a patient-derived T-ALL as well as K562 and HL60 cells, both in in vitro CRA and in a xenografted human leukemia SCID mouse model. The NK-92 cells did not induce the development of leukemia in SCID mice after i.v., i.p., or s.c. inoculation. In adoptive transfer experiments, SCID mice receiving i.p. inoculations of human leukemias derived from a T-ALL (TA27) and an AML (MA26) that were highly sensitive to the cytolysis of NK-92 cells in vitro, as well as a pre-B-ALL (BA31) that was insensitive to the in vitro cytolysis of NK-92 cells, were treated by administration of NK-92 cells with or without rhIL2 (2 x 10(7) NK-92 cells i.p.; one dose or five doses). Survival times of SCID mice bearing the sensitive TA27 and MA26 leukemias were significantly prolonged by adoptive cell therapy with NK-92 cells. Some of the animals who received five doses of NK-92 cells with or without rhIL2 administration were still alive without any signs of leukemia development 6 months after leukemia inoculation. In contrast, survival of mice bearing the insensitive BA31 leukemia were not affected by this treatment. This in vitro and in vivo antileukemia effect of NK-92 cells suggests that cytotoxic NK cells of this type may have potential as effectors of leukemia control.","['Yan, Y', 'Steinherz, P', 'Klingemann, H G', 'Dennig, D', 'Childs, B H', 'McGuirk, J', ""O'Reilly, R J""]","['Yan Y', 'Steinherz P', 'Klingemann HG', 'Dennig D', 'Childs BH', 'McGuirk J', ""O'Reilly RJ""]","['Bone Marrow Transplantation Service, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York 10021, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line', '*Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/immunology/pathology', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy', 'Killer Cells, Lymphokine-Activated/immunology/pathology', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*immunology/pathology', 'Leukemia/immunology/pathology/*therapy', 'Leukemoid Reaction', 'Mice', 'Mice, SCID', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Survival Analysis', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology/pathology', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/immunology/pathology', 'Transplantation, Heterologous', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1998/11/26 00:00,1998/11/26 00:01,['1998/11/26 00:00'],"['1998/11/26 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/11/26 00:01 [medline]', '1998/11/26 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 1998 Nov;4(11):2859-68.,['CA23766/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Prior imaging studies using 111In-T101 demonstrated uptake in involved lymph nodes and skin in patients with CTCL, and Phase I studies with unmodified T101 demonstrated transient responses. In this study, patients were treated with 5 or 10 mCi of 90Y chelated to T101 via isothiocyanatobenzyl diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid, along with tracer doses of 111In-T101 for imaging. The biodistribution of the radioimmunoconjugate was determined by measuring 90Y and 111In blood clearance, urine excretion, and accumulation in bone marrow and in involved skin lesions. The intravascular pharmacokinetics of 90Y were predicted by 111In-labeled T101. The greatest differences in biodistribution between 111In and 90Y were in the higher bone accumulation of 90Y and its lower urinary excretion. Imaging studies demonstrated targeting of skin lesions and involved lymph nodes in CTCL patients. The predominant toxicity was bone marrow suppression. Rapid antigenic modulation of CD5 on circulating T and B cells was observed. Recovery of T-cell populations occurred within 2-3 weeks; however, suppression of B-cell populations persisted after 5+ weeks.

Patients achieving a partial response or significant hematological improvement received a second course. All patients subsequently received standard treatment for ALL. Because complete response was achieved in only 1 of 14 patients, the study was terminated prematurely. An additional patient achieved minimal response, and a third patient normalized her hemogram despite ongoing leukemia in the marrow. Overall, six patients had significant hematological improvement (normalization of platelet and/or absolute neutrophil count). Two patients expired due to infections during induction chemotherapy. The primary nonhematological toxicities were mucositis and diarrhea. Exposure to TPT did not appear to influence the response to subsequent standard chemotherapy. The mean steady-state TPT plasma concentration, 16.1+/-1 nM, overlapped the range of LD90 values of primary human leukemia specimens. Cellular topo I content varied over a 3-fold range, encompassing levels found previously in relapsed patients. No relationship was found between topo I expression and markers of cellular proliferation or response to therapy. In contrast, low expression of the apoptosis inhibitor Bcl-2 was associated with response to TPT therapy. TPT has significant, albeit modest, single-agent activity against high-risk adult ALL.

As a tumor system, we used the well-characterized highly aggressive DBA/2 mouse leukemia ESb and its less aggressive adhesion variant, ESb-MP. Systemic IL-2 treatment was performed with recombinant human interleukin-2 (Proleukin), which was slowly released via an implanted osmotic pump or was modified with polyethylene glycol (PEG-IL-2) to achieve constant plasma levels. Allogeneic B10.D2 antitumor immune spleen cells (ISPL cells) exerted strong graft-versus-leukemia (GvL) reactivity after adoptive transfer into late-stage ESb-MP tumor-bearing DBA/2 mice. Mls(a) superantigen-reactive vbeta6 donor T cells were not eliminated or tolerized by in vivo priming with the tumor cells and were present in active proliferation in liver infiltrates. When exogenous PEG-IL-2 or Proleukin was applied in addition to ISPL cells in such mice, the strong GvL-mediated protective immunity was converted into a fatal graft-versus-host disease. IL-2 treatment alone had no toxic effect and caused a moderate protection effect in the absence of an effect on local tumor growth. Potentiation of GvH reactivity of B10.D2 ISPL by PEG-IL-2 was proven in non-tumor-bearing DBA/2 mice, in which graft-versus-host disease was characterized by: (a) heavy hepatic lymphocytic infiltration, (b) irreversible increase of serum glutamate-oxalacetate-transaminase and glutamate-pyruvate-transaminase levels, (c) weight loss, and (d) death. Antagonistic effects of systemic IL-2 on GvL were observed with syngeneic DBA/2 anti-ESb immune peritoneal effector cells (PECs). There was a detrimental effect of systemic IL-2 on liver target organ infiltration by immune T cells causing, at day 6 after transfer, a drop from 20-30 CD4 or CD8 T cells per liver lobule in the PEC group to <5 in the PEC plus IL-2 group. The results emphasize the importance of a better understanding of IL-2 function in vivo and of its interaction with immune cell function to improve protocols for optimal application in the clinic to achieve maximal GvL effects.","['Schirrmacher, V', 'Muerkoster, S', 'Umansky, V']","['Schirrmacher V', 'Muerkoster S', 'Umansky V']","['German Cancer Research Center, Division of Cellular Immunology, Heidelberg.

However, expression from the transcription unit of the Mo-MuLV long terminal repeat (LTR) has often been unsatisfactory. Transcriptional suppression of retroviral vectors in vitro in embryonal carcinoma (EC) cells and in vivo in hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) has been associated with increased levels of cytosine methylation in the vector 5' LTR. To obtain a comprehensive picture of the methylation pattern in the 5' LTR of retroviral vectors, we employed the bisulfite genomic sequencing technique, which allows detection of the methylation pattern of every CpG dinucleotide in a target sequence. We studied the 5' LTR within the Mo-MuLV-based vector, LN, and a series of multiply modified vectors, which show improved expression in vitro and in vivo. Methylation patterns of the vectors were compared in PA317 (3T3-derived) fibroblasts, which are permissive for expression from all of the vectors, and in F9 embryonal carcinoma (EC) cells, which are restrictive for expression from the parental Mo-MuLV LTR but show improved expression from the modified vectors. These analyses revealed that the levels of methylation of CpG dinucleotides were globally consistent throughout the entire LTR, including the region of transcriptional factor binding. All vectors showed no measurable methylation of CpG dinucleotides throughout the 5' LTR in the PA317 fibroblasts. The CpG dinucleotides of the standard Mo-MuLV-based vector (LN) were highly methylated in F9 EC cells (49.1%). The doubly modified vector, MD-neo, which did not show improved expression, exhibited a relatively high level of methylation (45%), similar to that found in the LN vector. In contrast, the CpG dinucleotides of the triply modified vectors, which showed improved expression in EC cells (MND-neo and MTD-neo), were much less methylated (26.2 and 23.4%, respectively). The results extend our previous findings of an inverse correlation between gene expression and methylation of cytosine residues of the LTR of retroviral vectors.","['Wang, L', 'Robbins, P B', 'Carbonaro, D A', 'Kohn, D B']","['Wang L', 'Robbins PB', 'Carbonaro DA', 'Kohn DB']","['Childrens Hospital Los Angeles, Department of Pediatrics, University of Southern California School of Medicine, 90027, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Hum Gene Ther,Human gene therapy,9008950,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (Sulfites)', '0 (Thy-1 Antigens)', '8J337D1HZY (Cytosine)', 'OJ9787WBLU (hydrogen sulfite)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Blotting, Northern', 'Carcinoma, Embryonal/virology', 'CpG Islands', 'Cytosine/*analysis/*metabolism', 'DNA Methylation', 'DNA Primers', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Viral', 'Genetic Vectors', 'Mice', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/genetics', 'Retroviridae/*genetics', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA/*methods', 'Sulfites', '*Terminal Repeat Sequences', 'Thy-1 Antigens/genetics', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1998/11/26 00:00,1998/11/26 00:01,['1998/11/26 00:00'],"['1998/11/26 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/11/26 00:01 [medline]', '1998/11/26 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1089/hum.1998.9.16-2321 [doi]'],ppublish,Hum Gene Ther. 1998 Nov 1;9(16):2321-30. doi: 10.1089/hum.1998.9.16-2321.,"['1PO1 CA59318/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', '1RO1 DK49000/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The latter further proliferate and undergo a process of maturation into circulating blood cells of myeloid and erythroid lineages /2/. Haemopoietic cell growth and differentiation is primarily regulated by the local production of various cytokines within the bone marrow micro-environment /3/, as well as by the circulating hormone, erythropoietin (EPO). The formation as well as functional activation of mature blood cells, are also modulated by a variety of hormones and growth peptides, including growth hormone (GH) and insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) /4,5/. Early evidence for the role of GH in modulating haemopoiesis was provided in classical studies in rodents, which showed that removal of the pituitary gland affects blood cell formation and function /6/ and that impairment of the latter can be restored by GH administration /7/. GH exerts its effects on target cells by binding to its own receptor, which belongs to the class I cytokine receptor superfamily /8/. In humans, GH can also bind to and activate the prolactin receptor /9/. Based on the somatomedin hypothesis of Salmon and Daughaday /10/, it is now generally accepted that, in addition to the above, GH exerts many of its effects via autocrine or paracrine IGF-I, as well as via endocrine IGF-I produced in the liver. IGF-I, a small single-chain polypeptide, is one of two highly homologous peptides (IGF-I and IGF-II), that stimulate the proliferation and differentiation of a wide variety of cell types, including bone marrow cells /5,11/. Both IGF-I and IGF-II play an important role in prenatal growth and IGF-I is also essential for postnatal growth and development /12/. Two types of IGF receptors have been described. The type I IGF receptor, a tyrosine kinase receptor highly homologous to the insulin receptor, binds IGF-I and IGF-II with a high affinity. The type II/mannose 6-phosphate receptor which lacks intrinsic kinase activity, binds IGF-II with a high affinity and IGF-I with a low affinity /13,14/. Haemopoietic progenitors and mature blood cells have been shown to produce GH and IGF-I and to express receptors for these peptides. GH and IGF-I may act independently on these cells or, as more commonly observed, in a synergistic manner with primary haemopoietic cytokines. GH and IGF-I receptors are also present on freshly explanted leukemic cells and leukemic cell lines. Thus, their possible contribution to the development of leukemia should also be considered.

The lessons learned from the treatment of paediatric cancer may lead to improvements in the treatment of adult cancers.","['Taub, J W']",['Taub JW'],"[""Division of Paediatric Hematology/Oncology, Children's Hospital of Michigan, Barbara Ann Karmanos Cancer Institute, Wayne State University School of Medicine, Detroit, Michigan, USA. jtaub@med.wayne.edu""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",New Zealand,Drugs,Drugs,7600076,,IM,"['Brain Neoplasms/therapy', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Hodgkin Disease/therapy', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/therapy', 'Neoplasms/diagnosis/*mortality/*therapy', 'Neuroblastoma/therapy', 'Prognosis', 'Retinoblastoma/therapy', 'Rhabdomyosarcoma/therapy', 'Sarcoma, Ewing/therapy', 'Wilms Tumor/therapy']",1998/11/26 00:00,1998/11/26 00:01,['1998/11/26 00:00'],"['1998/11/26 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/11/26 00:01 [medline]', '1998/11/26 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.2165/00003495-199856050-00002 [doi]'],ppublish,Drugs. 1998 Nov;56(5):757-65. doi: 10.2165/00003495-199856050-00002.,,,,89,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Experiments performed on histological slides of testis tumours reflected a heterogeneous picture: non-apoptotic (normal) cells, apoptotic cells, and apoptotic bodies appeared either with or without detectable DNA cleavage. These data allowed the characterization and quantitation of the grade of disturbance/heterogeneity of the apoptosis programme in vivo. Furthermore, the measured apoptotic index (AI) based on apoptosis morphology was lower than the AI assessed by DNA cleavage, in contrast to published work. Taken together, these methods represent a new approach and might be suitable for improved correlation with clinical parameters.

We evaluated this experience. METHODS: Placental blood was stored under liquid nitrogen and selected for specific patients on the basis of HLA type and leukocyte content. Patients were prepared for the transplantation of allogeneic hematopoietic cells in the placental blood and received prophylaxis against graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) according to routine procedures at each center. RESULTS: Outcomes at 100 days after transplantation were known for all 562 patients, and outcomes at 1 year for 94 percent of eligible recipients. The cumulative rates of engraftment among the recipients, according to actuarial analysis, were 81 percent by day 42 for neutrophils (median time to engraftment, 28 days) and 85 percent by day 180 for platelets (median, day 90). The speed of myeloid engraftment was associated primarily with the leukocyte content of the graft, whereas transplantation-related events were associated with the patient's underlying disease and age, the number of leukocytes in the graft, the degree of HLA disparity, and the transplantation center. After engraftment, age, HLA disparity, and center were the primary predictors of outcome. Severe acute GVHD (grade III or IV) occurred in 23 percent of patients, and chronic GVHD occurred in 25 percent. The rate of relapse among recipients with leukemia was 9 percent within the first 100 days, 17 percent within 6 months, and 26 percent by 1 year. These rates were associated with the severity of GVHD, type of leukemia, and stage of the disease. CONCLUSIONS: Placental blood is a useful source of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cells for bone marrow reconstitution.","['Rubinstein, P', 'Carrier, C', 'Scaradavou, A', 'Kurtzberg, J', 'Adamson, J', 'Migliaccio, A R', 'Berkowitz, R L', 'Cabbad, M', 'Dobrila, N L', 'Taylor, P E', 'Rosenfield, R E', 'Stevens, C E']","['Rubinstein P', 'Carrier C', 'Scaradavou A', 'Kurtzberg J', 'Adamson J', 'Migliaccio AR', 'Berkowitz RL', 'Cabbad M', 'Dobrila NL', 'Taylor PE', 'Rosenfield RE', 'Stevens CE']","['F.H.

The derived stable cell lines (MMH from Met murine hepatocyte) are highly differentiated and nontransformed. In this report, the capacity of MMHs to support in vitro hematopoiesis is characterized. By reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction, the expression by MMHs of cytokines involved in the survival and self-renewal of early progenitor cells (stem cell factor and FLT3 ligand) as well as those acting at different stages of progenitor differentiation (interleukin [IL] 1beta, IL-3, leukemia inhibitory factor, IL-6, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor, macrophage colony-stimulating factor, and thrombopoietin) was shown. A ribonuclease protection assay further substantiated the presence of at least six cytokine transcripts in MMH lines. Cocultures between MMH layers and progenitor-enriched fetal liver hematopoietic cells resulted in a 40-fold to 80-fold expansion of total hematopoietic cells and in a 2.5-fold expansion of clonogenic progenitors after 1 to 2 weeks. Hematopoiesis was maintained for up to 6 weeks with formation of typical cobblestone cell areas and continuous differentiation of precursor into cells at various degrees of maturation. At 5 weeks of coculture, clonogenic progenitors were maintained at 20% of the input level in coculture with embryonic-derived hepatocytes, showing the ability of hepatocyte feeder layer to support survival and possibly self-renewal of clonogenic progenitors. Therefore, the data emphasize a direct role of the hepatocyte in sustaining hematopoietic cell proliferation and differentiation.","['Aiuti, A', 'Cicchini, C', 'Bernardini, S', 'Fedele, G', 'Amicone, L', 'Fantoni, A', 'Tripodi, M']","['Aiuti A', 'Cicchini C', 'Bernardini S', 'Fedele G', 'Amicone L', 'Fantoni A', 'Tripodi M']","['Fondazione Istituto Pasteur-Cenci Bolognetti, Dipartimento di Biotecnologie Cellulari ed Ematologia, Universita La Sapienza, Roma, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Hepatology,"Hepatology (Baltimore, Md.)",8302946,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Growth Substances)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-met)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Animals, Newborn/anatomy & histology', 'Cell Differentiation/physiology', 'Cell Line', 'Cellular Senescence/physiology', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'Cytokines/*metabolism', 'Fetus/cytology', 'Growth Substances/metabolism/physiology', 'Hematopoiesis/*physiology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology/physiology', 'Liver/cytology/embryology/*physiology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic/genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-met/chemistry/genetics/metabolism']",1998/11/26 00:00,1998/11/26 00:01,['1998/11/26 00:00'],"['1998/11/26 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/11/26 00:01 [medline]', '1998/11/26 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0270913998004984 [pii]', '10.1002/hep.510280626 [doi]']",ppublish,Hepatology. 1998 Dec;28(6):1645-54. doi: 10.1002/hep.510280626.,"['TGT00A03/Telethon/Italy', 'TGT06S01/Telethon/Italy']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, we examined the dynamics of GATA-1 and NF-E2 hematopoietic transcription factors during the induction of apoptosis, because GATA-1 has been shown to be implicated in survival of erythroid cells. Formation of the GATA-1-DNA complex as judged by EMSA was markedly reduced when apoptosis was induced, although subcellular localization of the GATA-1 protein and expression levels of the GATA-1 mRNA and protein were not changed during the apoptotic process. Complex formation was not reduced when apoptosis was avoided by adding 30% serum in culture medium and when mutant PU.1 proteins with the deletion of the DNA-binding (Ets) or transactivation domain were expressed. Complex formation in nuclear extracts of parental MEL cells was reduced when they were mixed with those of apoptotic cells, suggesting that apoptotic cells may contain a factor(s) preventing GATA-1 from binding to DNA. In contrast to GATA-1, formation of the NF-E2-DNA complex was not changed during the process of apoptosis, although the expression level of the NF-E2 p45 gene was reduced in the process. These results suggest that reduction of the DNA-binding activity of GATA-1 may partly account for PU.1-mediated apoptosis in MEL cells.","['Yamada, T', 'Kihara-Negishi, F', 'Yamamoto, H', 'Yamamoto, M', 'Hashimoto, Y', 'Oikawa, T']","['Yamada T', 'Kihara-Negishi F', 'Yamamoto H', 'Yamamoto M', 'Hashimoto Y', 'Oikawa T']","['Department of Cell Genetics, Sasaki Institute, Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Exp Cell Res,Experimental cell research,0373226,"['0 (Cell Extracts)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Erythroid-Specific DNA-Binding Factors)', '0 (GATA1 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Gata1 protein, mouse)', '0 (NF-E2 Transcription Factor)', '0 (NF-E2 Transcription Factor, p45 Subunit)', '0 (Nfe2 protein, mouse)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (proto-oncogene protein Spi-1)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",IM,"['Animals', '*Apoptosis', 'Cell Extracts', 'Cell Nucleus/metabolism', 'DNA/*metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Erythroid-Specific DNA-Binding Factors', 'GATA1 Transcription Factor', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute', 'Mice', 'NF-E2 Transcription Factor', 'NF-E2 Transcription Factor, p45 Subunit', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger', 'Trans-Activators/*metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1998/11/26 00:00,1998/11/26 00:01,['1998/11/26 00:00'],"['1998/11/26 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/11/26 00:01 [medline]', '1998/11/26 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0014-4827(98)94251-3 [pii]', '10.1006/excr.1998.4251 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Cell Res. 1998 Nov 25;245(1):186-94. doi: 10.1006/excr.1998.4251.,,,,,,['Copyright 1998 Academic Press.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In addition, Pit-1 is required for adequate pituitary cell growth and may be involved in the pathogenesis of pituitary adenomas. Pit-1 expression has been also reported in nonpituitary tissues, where it might be involved in the control of cell proliferation. In order to elucidate such a possibility, we have investigated the changes in both Pit-1 mRNA and Pit-1 immunoreactivity in HL-60 cells following the addition of several differentiating agents. Our results show that while high Pit-1 levels are found in exponentially growing HL-60 cells, a significant decrease occurs after induction of cells to differentiate along the macrophage lineage with 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA). In contrast no changes were observed when cells were treated with interferon-alpha, which also induces differentiation of HL-60 cells that, at odds with TPA, is not accompanied with growth arrest. In all, these findings suggest that Pit-1 expression is specifically associated with proliferation in HL-60 cells, thus supporting the idea that one of the functions of nonpituitary Pit-1 may be the control of cell proliferation.","['Costoya, J A', 'Garcia-Barros, M', 'Gallego, R', 'Senaris, R', 'Arce, V M', 'Devesa, J']","['Costoya JA', 'Garcia-Barros M', 'Gallego R', 'Senaris R', 'Arce VM', 'Devesa J']","['Faculty of Medicine, University of Santiago de Compostela, Santiago de Compostela, 15705, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Exp Cell Res,Experimental cell research,0373226,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (Mitogens)', '0 (POU1F1 protein, human)', '0 (Transcription Factor Pit-1)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['*Cell Differentiation', '*Cell Division', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/*physiology', 'Gene Expression', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Homeodomain Proteins/genetics/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Interferon-gamma/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid', 'Mitogens/pharmacology', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Transcription Factor Pit-1', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/*physiology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1998/11/26 00:00,1998/11/26 00:01,['1998/11/26 00:00'],"['1998/11/26 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/11/26 00:01 [medline]', '1998/11/26 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0014-4827(98)94232-X [pii]', '10.1006/excr.1998.4232 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Cell Res. 1998 Nov 25;245(1):132-6. doi: 10.1006/excr.1998.4232.,,,,,,['Copyright 1998 Academic Press.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Results of a preliminary study.,743-50,"The frequency of CTL precursors (CTLp) directed towards recipient-derived pre-transplant leukaemic blasts (LB) was measured in the peripheral blood of nine children with acute leukaemia and given BMT from either an HLA-identical sibling or a matched unrelated donor (MUD). Patients were evaluated at various time points between 1 month and more than 2 years after transplantation. A high frequency of donor-derived LB-reactive CTLp was detectable 2-6 months after BMT in all children and persisted for at least up to 18 months in the eight patients in haematological remission, while it rapidly declined in the only patient who relapsed. Generation of LB-reactive T cell clones obtained from some of these patients demonstrates that various T lymphocyte subsets, either HLA class I-restricted/TCR-dependent or HLA-unrestricted, contribute to this phenomenon. The in vitro GVL effect here described seems to be at least partially separated from GVHR, since no correlation was observed between the emergence of LB-reactive CTLp and the development and/or severity of GVHD. Development of LB-reactive CTL in the patients was independent of the frequency of these cells in the donor. These data suggest that donor-derived CTL activity specifically directed towards leukaemic blasts may develop in patients given allogeneic BMT and contribute to the maintenance of a state of haematological remission.","['Montagna, D', 'Locatelli, F', 'Calcaterra, V', 'Comoli, P', 'Moretta, A', 'Giorgiani, G', 'Zecca, M', 'Bonetti, F', 'Giraldi, E', 'Rondini, G', 'Maccario, R']","['Montagna D', 'Locatelli F', 'Calcaterra V', 'Comoli P', 'Moretta A', 'Giorgiani G', 'Zecca M', 'Bonetti F', 'Giraldi E', 'Rondini G', 'Maccario R']","['Department of Pediatrics, University of Pavia, IRCCS Policlinico San Matteo, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Bone Marrow Transplant,Bone marrow transplantation,8702459,,IM,"['*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Humans', '*Immunotherapy, Adoptive', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/immunology/*therapy', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/immunology/*therapy', 'Secondary Prevention', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/*transplantation', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",1998/11/25 00:00,1998/11/25 00:01,['1998/11/25 00:00'],"['1998/11/25 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/11/25 00:01 [medline]', '1998/11/25 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.bmt.1701419 [doi]'],ppublish,Bone Marrow Transplant. 1998 Oct;22(8):743-50. doi: 10.1038/sj.bmt.1701419.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

ATRA treatment was well tolerated and found to be beneficial despite its prior use as a component of the initial induction protocol. ATRA therapy post-transplant led to molecular remission as determined by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) as well as reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analyses and remission now exceeds 3.5 years in both patients. Overall, this study not only demonstrates that ATRA may successfully salvage APL patients with residual disease post-transplant, but also suggests a potential role for retinoids post-consolidation as a means of eliminating residual disease which could be beneficial even in patients previously exposed to ATRA as a component of the induction protocol.","['Grimwade, D', 'Jamal, R', 'Goulden, N', 'Kempski, H', 'Mastrangelo, S', 'Veys, P']","['Grimwade D', 'Jamal R', 'Goulden N', 'Kempski H', 'Mastrangelo S', 'Veys P']","[""Division of Medical and Molecular Genetics, United Medical and Dental Schools of Guy's and St Thomas' Hospitals, London.""]",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*drug therapy/therapy', 'Neoplasm, Residual', 'Salvage Therapy/methods', 'Tretinoin/*therapeutic use']",1998/11/25 00:00,1998/11/25 00:01,['1998/11/25 00:00'],"['1998/11/25 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/11/25 00:01 [medline]', '1998/11/25 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1046/j.1365-2141.1998.01008.x [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 1998 Nov;103(2):559-62. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2141.1998.01008.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We also infected normal mononuclear peripheral cells cultured in PHA and rhIL-2 for 2 d, and obtained an average of 30% GFP+ cells, all present within the CD3+ population, with CD4+ and CD8+ cells being equally infected. Finally, the tonsillar purified B population showed lower levels of infectivity (6%) whereas high susceptibility was shown by normal human umbilical vein endothelial cells (57%). Highly purified CD34+ cells were also susceptible, varying from 6% to 10% GFP+ cells. Immature myeloid/erythroid progenitors have been infected which stably expressed the GFP protein during further differentiation in culture. The GFP+ T cells were FACS-sorted rapidly upon infection, subsequently cultured and the fluorescence intensity monitored. In all cases the difference in percentage of GFP+ cells did not correlate with the percentage of S/G2/M cycling cells as determined at the moment of infection or with the expression levels of Ram-1 amphotrophic receptor. The improved safety of this retroviral system, the rapidity of the technique, the high efficiency of infection with respect to normal T lymphocytes (in this last case higher than previously reported) and the lack of need for in vitro selection make this system favourable for clinical development.","['Introna, M', 'Barbui, A M', 'Golay, J', 'Bambacioni, F', 'Schiro, R', 'Bernasconi, S', 'Breviario, F', 'Erba, E', 'Borleri, G', 'Barbui, T', 'Biondi, A', 'Rambaldi, A']","['Introna M', 'Barbui AM', 'Golay J', 'Bambacioni F', 'Schiro R', 'Bernasconi S', 'Breviario F', 'Erba E', 'Borleri G', 'Barbui T', 'Biondi A', 'Rambaldi A']","['Istituto di Ricerche Farmacologiche Mario Negri, Milano, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Luminescent Proteins)', '147336-22-9 (Green Fluorescent Proteins)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD34/analysis', 'B-Lymphocytes/virology', 'Blotting, Northern', 'Endothelium/virology', '*Gene Transfer Techniques', 'Green Fluorescent Proteins', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*virology', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Luminescent Proteins/genetics', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/genetics', 'Retroviridae Infections/*genetics', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'T-Lymphocyte Subsets/*virology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1998/11/25 00:00,1998/11/25 00:01,['1998/11/25 00:00'],"['1998/11/25 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/11/25 00:01 [medline]', '1998/11/25 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1046/j.1365-2141.1998.01020.x [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 1998 Nov;103(2):449-61. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2141.1998.01020.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This is attributable to an immunologically mediated graft-versus-myeloma (GVM) effect which is akin to the well-known graft-versus-leukemia effect. The available clinical and experimental evidence strongly support the existence of GVM, but it is not known whether GVM is separable from graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) in practice. The best way to exploit GVM reactions is unclear, and the morbidity and mortality associated with GVHD undermine long-term survival. There is usually a time lag of a few weeks between immune intervention and disease response. There is a propensity for extramedullary disease recurrence in patients whose marrow disease is controlled with immunologic manipulation. Exploration of GVM outside conventional allogeneic transplantation or after autologous transplantation is necessary to increase the number of patients likely to benefit from this phenomenon and to make it safer.

Therefore, childhood malignancies can be used as tracers of accessibility to and effectiveness of medical care. The objective of this study was to compare the reduction of mortality from childhood cancer in general, and childhood leukemia in particular, in four economically developed areas of the world, to assess accessibility to and effectiveness of technologically advanced medical care. METHODS: The authors used data from the World Health Organization to compare the evolution over time of gender specific, age-adjusted mortality from childhood cancer in general and childhood leukemia in particular in the childhood (birth to age 14 years) populations of North America, western Europe, Japan, and Australia and New Zealand during the period 1960-1993. They assessed the evolution over time and the cumulative percentage representing the decline in mortality from childhood cancer and childhood leukemia in the four aforementioned areas of the world. RESULTS: The decline in mortality from both the disease entities considered and for both genders has been more pronounced in North America than in other economically developed areas of the world. CONCLUSIONS: When disease control depends on technologically advanced medical care, as in the case of cancer, the North American population is benefited by earlier and effective introduction of new therapeutic approaches. This conclusion does not apply to other childhood diseases, the incidence of which is higher among low-income groups and control of which depends on prevention rather than treatment.","['La Vecchia, C', 'Levi, F', 'Lucchini, F', 'Lagiou, P', 'Trichopoulos, D', 'Negri, E']","['La Vecchia C', 'Levi F', 'Lucchini F', 'Lagiou P', 'Trichopoulos D', 'Negri E']","['Istituto di Statistica Medica e Biometria, Universita di Milano, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Australia/epidemiology', 'Canada/epidemiology', 'Cause of Death/trends', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Developed Countries/*statistics & numerical data', 'Europe/epidemiology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Japan/epidemiology', 'Leukemia/mortality/therapy', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/*mortality/therapy', 'New Zealand/epidemiology', 'Quality of Health Care/*standards', 'Sex Distribution', 'United States/epidemiology']",1998/11/25 03:02,2000/06/20 09:00,['1998/11/25 03:02'],"['1998/11/25 03:02 [pubmed]', '2000/06/20 09:00 [medline]', '1998/11/25 03:02 [entrez]']",['10.1002/(SICI)1097-0142(19981115)83:10<2223::AID-CNCR23>3.0.CO;2-R [pii]'],ppublish,Cancer. 1998 Nov 15;83(10):2223-7.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Herein we showed that apoptosis induced by calphostin C in U937 human promonocytic leukemia cells was associated, at its onset, with enhanced protein (poly)ubiquitination. This observation prompted us to study whether protein degradation through the ubiquitin/proteasome pathway was involved in apoptosis induction. We found that N-acetyl-Leu-Leu-norleucinal (50 microM), a proteasome as well as a calpain inhibitor, was able to reduce calphostin C-induced apoptosis by approximately 60%, whereas lactacystin (10 microM), a specific proteasome inhibitor, was ineffective.

We previously identified MOAT-B, an MRP/cMOAT-related transporter, by use of a polymerase chain reaction approach. However, analysis of expressed sequence tag (EST) databases indicated that there might be additional MRP/cMOAT-related transporters. To further define the MRP/cMOAT subfamily of transporters, we used EST probes to isolate complementary DNAs for two related transporter proteins, MOAT-C and MOAT-D. METHODS: MOAT-C and MOAT-D expression patterns in human tissues were determined by RNA blot analysis, and chromosomal localization of the genes was determined by fluorescence in situ hybridization. RESULTS: MOAT-C is predicted to encode a 1437-amino-acid protein that, among eukaryotic transporters, is most closely related to MRP, cMOAT, and MOAT-B (about 36% identity). However, MOAT-C is less related to MRP and cMOAT than MRP and cMOAT are to each other (about 48% identity). Like MOAT-B, MOAT-C lacks an N-terminal membrane-spanning domain, indicating that the topology of this protein is similarly distinct from that of MRP and cMOAT. MOAT-D is predicted to encode a 1527-amino-acid protein that is the closest known relative of MRP (about 58% identity). MOAT-D is also highly related to cMOAT (about 47% identity). The presence of an N-terminal membrane-spanning domain indicates that the topology of MOAT-D is quite similar to that of MRP and cMOAT. MOAT-C transcripts are widely expressed in human tissues; however, MOAT-D transcript expression is more restricted. The MOAT-C and MOAT-D genes are located at chromosomes 3q27 and 17q21.3, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: On the basis of amino acid identity and protein topology, the MRP/cMOAT transporter subfamily falls into two groups; the first group consists of MRP, cMOAT, and MOAT-D, and the second group consists of MOAT-B and MOAT-C.","['Belinsky, M G', 'Bain, L J', 'Balsara, B B', 'Testa, J R', 'Kruh, G D']","['Belinsky MG', 'Bain LJ', 'Balsara BB', 'Testa JR', 'Kruh GD']","['Division of Medical Sciences, Fox Chase Cancer Center, Philadelphia, PA 19111, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Natl Cancer Inst,Journal of the National Cancer Institute,7503089,"['0 (ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters)', '0 (Anion Transport Proteins)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Multidrug Resistance-Associated Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)']",IM,"['ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters/*chemistry/genetics', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Anion Transport Proteins', 'Carrier Proteins/*chemistry/genetics', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 17/genetics', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 3/genetics', 'DNA, Neoplasm/*analysis/isolation & purification', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*genetics', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Multidrug Resistance-Associated Proteins', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*chemistry/genetics', 'Ovarian Neoplasms/*genetics', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA']",1998/11/25 00:00,1998/11/25 00:01,['1998/11/25 00:00'],"['1998/11/25 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/11/25 00:01 [medline]', '1998/11/25 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/jnci/90.22.1735 [doi]'],ppublish,J Natl Cancer Inst. 1998 Nov 18;90(22):1735-41. doi: 10.1093/jnci/90.22.1735.,"['CA06927/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA63173/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",['J Natl Cancer Inst. 1999 May 19;91(10):888-9.

In benign cutaneous pseudolymphomas of the human skin, human T-cell leukemia/lymphoma virus (HTLV) type I (HTLV-I), varicella zoster virus, Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), and human herpesvirus (HHV) 6 (HHV-6) are the viruses most often identified, whereas in malignant lymphoproliferation human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), HTLV-I/II, and EBV are more common. Coinfections with more than one virus species have occurred in a number of cases. HHV-8 in association with a lymphoproliferative lesion appears to be indicative of a malignant cutaneous lymphoma rather than of pseudolymphoma.

Specifically, a single dose of 320 nM of AS ODN immobilized to the nanospheres was capable of inhibiting HL60 cell proliferation with the same degree of efficiency obtained using a 50-fold higher dose of free AS ODN. Flow cytometric experiments with fluoresceinated ODNs showed a temperature-dependent uptake, which was detectable as early as 2 h after the beginning of treatment.

Recently we have shown that the levels of the protein tyrosine phosphatase PTP1B are enhanced in p210 bcr-abl-expressing cell lines. Furthermore, PTP1B recognizes p210 bcr-abl as a substrate, disrupts the formation of a p210 bcr-abl/Grb2 complex, and inhibits signaling events initiated by this oncoprotein PTK. In this report, we have examined whether PTP1B effects transformation induced by p210 bcr-abl. We demonstrate that expression of either wild-type PTP1B or the substrate-trapping mutant form of the enzyme (PTP1B-D181A) in p210 bcr-abl-transformed Rat-1 fibroblasts diminished the ability of these cells to form colonies in soft agar, to grow in reduced serum, and to form tumors in nude mice. In contrast, TCPTP, the closest relative of PTP1B, did not effect p210 bcr-abl-induced transformation. Furthermore, neither PTP1B nor TCPTP inhibited transformation induced by v-Abl. In addition, overexpression of PTP1B or treatment with CGP57148, a small molecule inhibitor of p210 bcr-abl, induced erythroid differentiation of K562 cells, a CML cell line derived from a patient in blast crisis. These data suggest that PTP1B is a selective, endogenous inhibitor of p210 bcr-abl and is likely to be important in the pathogenesis of CML.","['LaMontagne, K R Jr', 'Hannon, G', 'Tonks, N K']","['LaMontagne KR Jr', 'Hannon G', 'Tonks NK']","['Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY 11724, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (Recombinant Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases)']",IM,"['Animals', '*Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Line', '*Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'Fibroblasts', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/biosynthesis/*genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Kinetics', 'Mice', 'Mice, Nude', 'Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases/biosynthesis/genetics/*metabolism', 'Rats', 'Recombinant Proteins/biosynthesis/metabolism', 'Transfection']",1998/11/25 03:01,2001/03/28 10:01,['1998/11/25 03:01'],"['1998/11/25 03:01 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1998/11/25 03:01 [entrez]']",['10.1073/pnas.95.24.14094 [doi]'],ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1998 Nov 24;95(24):14094-9. doi: 10.1073/pnas.95.24.14094.,"['P01 CA064593/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA64593/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,PMC24332,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Nuclear envelope breakdown occurs during mitotic M-phase, the envelope reforming immediately after cell division, thereby permitting the translocation of the retroviral preintegration complex into the nucleus and enabling integration to proceed. In the oocyte, during metaphase II (MII) of the second meiosis, the nuclear envelope is also absent and the oocyte remains in MII arrest for a much longer period of time compared with M-phase in a somatic cell. Pseudotyped replication-defective retroviral vector was injected into the perivitelline space of bovine oocytes during MII. We show that reverse-transcribed gene transfer can take place in an oocyte in MII arrest of meiosis, leading to production of offspring, the majority of which are transgenic.

Cloning and characterization of cDNAs encoding CD30 and its ligand (CD30L) established these proteins as members of the tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNFR) and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) superfamilies, respectively. Expression of CD30 is mostly restricted to virus-infected lymphocytes, neoplasms of lymphoid origin and a subset of activated T cells which produce Th2-type cytokines. The ligand is present on activated T cells, resting B cells, granulocytes, and the medulla of the thymus (epithelial cells and Hassal's corpuscles) as well as in various leukemia cells. The biological function of CD30 is pleiotropic but has come to be understood in the context of co-stimulatory signals. Signal transduction of CD30 utilizes signal transducers, TNFR-associated factors (TRAF1, 2, 3 and 5), which are shared by other TNFR family members.

On the other hand, falconensone B, the 4'-nor-methyl derivative of falconensone A, showed much lower activity than falconensone A on the inhibition of cell growth. In addition, synthetic derivatives of falconensone A, falconensone A p-bromophenylhydrazone and falconensone A dioxime, were more potent on the inhibition of cell growth and the induction of differentiation than natural falconensones A and B. These compounds induced differentiation of HL60 cells into monocyte/macrophage-like cells, different from granulocyte-like cells induced by RA. These results suggest that falconensone A may be a new type of antiproliferative agent, and that the methyl residue at the 4' position of the cyclopentenone ring of falconensone A may be necessary for biological activity. In addition, falconensone A enhanced RA-induced differentiation of HL60 cells, while its derivatives alone showed growth inhibition and induction of differentiation of HL60 cells. Based on these results, falconensone A and its derivatives may have clinical utility in the treatment of leukemia.","['Takahashi, N', 'Iwahori, A', 'Kawai, K', 'Fukui, T']","['Takahashi N', 'Iwahori A', 'Kawai K', 'Fukui T']","['Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Hoshi University, Shinagawa-ku, Tokyo, 142-8501, Japan. t-noriko@hoshi.ac.jp']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Arch Biochem Biophys,Archives of biochemistry and biophysics,0372430,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Hydrazones)', '0 (Oximes)', '0 (Pigments, Biological)', '0 (Polyenes)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Aspergillus', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Growth Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'HL-60 Cells/*drug effects/pathology', 'Humans', 'Hydrazones/pharmacology', 'Oximes/pharmacology', 'Pigments, Biological/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Polyenes/*pharmacology', 'Tretinoin/pharmacology']",1998/11/25 00:00,1998/11/25 00:01,['1998/11/25 00:00'],"['1998/11/25 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/11/25 00:01 [medline]', '1998/11/25 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0003986198909225 [pii]', '10.1006/abbi.1998.0922 [doi]']",ppublish,Arch Biochem Biophys. 1998 Dec 1;360(1):113-20. doi: 10.1006/abbi.1998.0922.,,,,,,['Copyright 1998 Academic Press.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

For a subset of patients the AML blasts show constitutive cytokine secretion and can undergo autonomous proliferation in vitro, whereas for other patients the blasts are dependent on exogenous cytokines for proliferation. The capability of autocrine proliferation is an adverse prognostic factor in AML. The three cytokines interleukin (IL)-4, IL-10 and IL-13 modulate in vitro blast proliferation, but the final effect of each cytokine (enhancement/inhibition/no effect) depends on differences between individual patients as well as the presence of other exogenous cytokines. In contrast to these divergent effects on blast proliferation, all three cytokines inhibit constitutive in vitro cytokine secretion by AML blasts. Because of the divergent effects on blast proliferation, it seems less likely that clinical therapy with these cytokines can be used to directly modulate AML blast proliferation. However, their effects on normal immunocompetent cells (and possibly the antigen-presenting capacity of AML blasts) are easier to predict. Thus direct (therapy with exogenous IL-4, IL-10 or IL-13) or indirect (enhancement of endogenous release of IL-4, IL-10 or IL-13) modulation of these cytokine effects on immunocompetent cells may become a useful clinical approach for enhancement of antileukemic immune effects. Such a modulation of immune reactivity can be used either as in vivo patient therapy or as manipulation of stem cell grafts prior to transplantation.","['Bruserud, O']",['Bruserud O'],"['Medical Department B, Haukeland University Hospital and The University of Bergen, Norway.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",England,Cytokines Cell Mol Ther,"Cytokines, cellular & molecular therapy",9713367,"['0 (Interleukin-13)', '130068-27-8 (Interleukin-10)', '207137-56-2 (Interleukin-4)']",IM,"['Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-10/*immunology', 'Interleukin-13/*immunology', 'Interleukin-4/*immunology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*immunology']",1998/11/24 00:00,1998/11/24 00:01,['1998/11/24 00:00'],"['1998/11/24 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/11/24 00:01 [medline]', '1998/11/24 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cytokines Cell Mol Ther. 1998 Sep;4(3):187-98.,,,,137,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

TSA caused a marked increase in both anti-sheep red blood cell (SRBC) and anti-trinitrophenyl (TNP) plaque-forming cell (PFC) responses in splenocytes at much lower concentrations than sodium butyrate. It also dose dependently augmented the production of anti-trinitrophenyl antibodies in splenic B cells with a concomitant, moderate increase in the level of histone H4 acetylation. Its optimal concentration for promoting the production of these antibodies was 10 nM. However, to gain such an effect on antibody production, TSA had to be added to cells before Day 2 in culture. Trichostatin C, an analog of TSA and a less potent inducer of Friend leukemia cell differentiation, also increased both the anti-trinitrophenyl PFC response and histone H4 acetylation in B cells, but at higher concentrations than TSA. TSA did not stimulate the production of lipopolysaccharide-induced polyclonal immunoglobulin M in B cells. These results suggest that a moderate increase in histone acetylation may play a significant role in promoting antigen-specific antibody production in B cells.","['Kohge, T', 'Gohda, E', 'Okamura, T', 'Yamamoto, I']","['Kohge T', 'Gohda E', 'Okamura T', 'Yamamoto I']","['Department of Immunochemistry, Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Okayama University, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Biochem Pharmacol,Biochemical pharmacology,0101032,"['0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors)', '0 (Histones)', '0 (Hydroxamic Acids)', '0 (Immunoglobulin M)', '3X2S926L3Z (trichostatin A)']",IM,"['Acetylation', 'Animals', '*Antibody Formation', '*Antigen-Antibody Reactions', 'B-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Female', 'Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors', 'Histones/*metabolism', 'Hydroxamic Acids/pharmacology', 'Immunoglobulin M/biosynthesis', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C']",1998/11/24 00:00,1998/11/24 00:01,['1998/11/24 00:00'],"['1998/11/24 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/11/24 00:01 [medline]', '1998/11/24 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-2952(98)00183-X [pii]', '10.1016/s0006-2952(98)00183-x [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Pharmacol. 1998 Nov 15;56(10):1359-64. doi: 10.1016/s0006-2952(98)00183-x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This co-operative study was conducted to assess the relative risk associated with several candidate factors including age, splenectomy, combined modality therapy and cumulative drug dose including alkylating agents and nitrosurea derivatives. DESIGN AND METHODS: This study evaluated the risk of acute leukemia according to pretreatment variables and therapy modalities among 1659 patients treated for Hodgkin's disease and followed for a median time of 10 years. Both case-control and actuarial risk studies were performed. Median age was 34 years (range: 12-83); 53% of patients were splenectomized. As to the overall therapy, 348 patients (21%) were given radiotherapy (RT) alone, 375 (23%) chemotherapy (CT) alone (including MOPP, MOPP + ABVD or MOPP + ABVD + lomustine); 936 (56%) received both CT and RT, either as primary or salvage treatment. RESULTS: The overall 15-year actuarial risk of leukemia was 4.2%; the hazard function curve showed two peaks of risk at the 3th and the 8th year from the initiation of therapy and no leukemia beyond the 12th year of follow-up. Risk of leukemia was 0.3% after RT alone, 2.8% after CT alone (2.2% after MOPP; 4.4% after MOPP + ABVD + lomustine), and 5.4% in patients given combined modality therapy (10.2% for RT + MOPP; 15.6% for RT + MOPP + lomustine). No leukemia occurred after ABVD alone and the risk was low (0.6%) when neither mechlorethamine nor lomustine were utilized. Patients who had received extended radiotherapy including abdomen and pelvis in addition to MOPP showed a significantly higher risk of leukemia compared to those given limited RT + MOPP (P = 0.01). Case-control analysis indicated advanced stage, type and duration (> 8 months) of CT and extension of RT as significant risk factors for leukemia. Compared to RT alone, the odds ratio was 5.9 after MOPP + extended RT, and 8 when a lomustine-containing regimen was used, as well. Neither age nor splenectomy were independent risk factors for leukemia; splenectomy was influential only when patients had been given MOPP chemotherapy, as well. INTERPRETATIONS AND CONCLUSIONS: Both case-control and actuarial analyses indicated that: a) combined modality therapy with MOPP and extensive RT (including abdomen and pelvis), and the use of lomustine added to the leukemogenic risk of MOPP alone; b) programs without mechlorethamine, procarbazine and lomustine were almost devoid of leukemogenic risk.","['Brusamolino, E', 'Anselmo, A P', 'Klersy, C', 'Santoro, M', 'Orlandi, E', 'Pagnucco, G', 'Lunghi, F', 'Maurizi-Enrici, R', 'Baroni, C D', 'Lazzarino, M', 'Mandelli, F', 'Bernasconi, C']","['Brusamolino E', 'Anselmo AP', 'Klersy C', 'Santoro M', 'Orlandi E', 'Pagnucco G', 'Lunghi F', 'Maurizi-Enrici R', 'Baroni CD', 'Lazzarino M', 'Mandelli F', 'Bernasconi C']","['Istituto di Ematologia, Universita di Pavia, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating)', '35S93Y190K (Procarbazine)', '50D9XSG0VR (Mechlorethamine)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '7BRF0Z81KG (Lomustine)', 'VB0R961HZT (Prednisone)', 'MOPP protocol']",IM,"['Abdomen/radiation effects', 'Actuarial Analysis', 'Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating/administration & dosage/*adverse effects', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*adverse effects', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cause of Death', 'Child', 'Combined Modality Therapy/*adverse effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Hodgkin Disease/complications/drug therapy/radiotherapy/*therapy', 'Humans', 'Italy/epidemiology', 'Leukemia/chemically induced/*epidemiology/etiology', 'Leukemia, Radiation-Induced/*epidemiology/etiology', 'Lomustine/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Male', 'Mechlorethamine/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/chemically induced/epidemiology/etiology', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/chemically induced/*epidemiology/etiology', 'Odds Ratio', 'Pelvis/radiation effects', 'Prednisone/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Procarbazine/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Radiotherapy/*adverse effects', 'Risk', 'Splenectomy/adverse effects', 'Vincristine/administration & dosage/adverse effects']",1998/11/24 00:00,1998/11/24 00:01,['1998/11/24 00:00'],"['1998/11/24 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/11/24 00:01 [medline]', '1998/11/24 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Haematologica. 1998 Sep;83(9):812-23.,,['Haematologica. 1998 Sep;83(9):769-70.

Associazione Italiana Ematologia Oncologia Pediatrica.,791-9,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Since 1988 the AIEOP has used BFM-based chemotherapy for childhood ALL. Current organization and results and role of cranial irradiation in the AIEOP-ALL 91 study are reported. DESIGN AND METHODS: From 1991 to 1995, 1194 children (< 15 years) with non-B ALL, were enrolled and assigned to the standard risk [SR: age > 1 year, non-T-ALL, BFM risk factor (RF) < 0.8], intermediate risk (IR: RF > or = 0.8 but < 1.7, or with RF < 0.8 and age < 1 year, or T-ALL), or high risk [HR: RF > or = 1.7, or t(9;22), or t(4;11) or prednisone poor response or late response or CNS involvement] groups. All patients received initially protocol Ia. Thereafter SR patients received HD-MTX 2 g/m2, a modified protocol II, and continuation therapy with triple intrathecal chemotherapy (TIT); IR patients received protocol Ib, HD-MTX 5 g/m2, protocol II and continuation therapy with TIT; HR patients received 9 polychemotherapy blocks, cranial irradiation and continuation therapy. Duration of treatment was 24 months. A randomized study was conducted to evaluate the impact of high-dose asparaginase in non high risk patients: the results of this study cannot be disclosed yet. RESULTS: One thousand one hundred and fifty-two (96.5%) patients achieved CR. Overall EFS (SE) at 5-years was 71.0% (1.4), with a survival of 80.3% (1.3). Relapse occurred in 262 children (21.9%), either in the marrow (n = 192 isolated and 32 with other sites, 18.7%), in the CNS (n = 18, 1.5%), or elsewhere (n = 20, 1.7%). 5-year EFS (SE) was 83.3% (2.4) in SR, 74.7% (1.8) in IR, and 39.7% (3.5) in HR groups, respectively. INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: Overall cure rate was higher than in the previous AIEOP-ALL 88 study. Treatment intensification with polychemotherapy blocks did not improve results in HR. Cranial irradiation can be safely omitted in over 80% of children treated with BFM based chemotherapy.","['Conter, V', 'Arico, M', 'Valsecchi, M G', 'Rizzari, C', 'Testi, A', 'Miniero, R', 'Di Tullio, M T', 'Lo Nigro, L', 'Pession, A', 'Rondelli, R', 'Messina, C', 'Santoro, N', 'Mori, P G', 'De Rossi, G', 'Tamaro, P', 'Silvestri, D', 'Biondi, A', 'Basso, G', 'Masera, G']","['Conter V', 'Arico M', 'Valsecchi MG', 'Rizzari C', 'Testi A', 'Miniero R', 'Di Tullio MT', 'Lo Nigro L', 'Pession A', 'Rondelli R', 'Messina C', 'Santoro N', 'Mori PG', 'De Rossi G', 'Tamaro P', 'Silvestri D', 'Biondi A', 'Basso G', 'Masera G']","[""Clinica Pediatrica dell'Universita di: Milano, Ospedale S.

P-glycoprotein (Pgp), which is associated with the multidrug resistance (MDR) phenotype, has been reported to be an important predictor of treatment outcome. The aim of this study was to analyze the value of Pgp expression in bone marrow or peripheral blood as a predictor of the response to remission induction chemotherapy as well as the duration of remission in patients with de novo acute myeloid leukemia (AML). DESIGN AND METHODS: We examined the expression of Pgp in 82 patients with de novo AML using an immunocytochemical assay with the C219 monoclonal antibody. RESULTS: Twenty-seven of the 82 patients (33%) were C219-positive in from 1% to 100% of their cells. Thirteen cases (16%) showed a positive reaction in more than 50% of the leukemic cells. Only hyperleukocytosis was significantly associated with higher expression of Pgp. Although 8 of the 13 cases (62%) with more than 50% of cells having Pgp expression were CD34-positive, this association was not statistically significant. A univariate analysis of resistance to induction therapy showed a significantly higher resistance rate in patients with increased Pgp expression (P = 0.01) as well as in those patients with decreased reactivity to myeloperoxidase. The multivariate analysis revealed the independent prognostic value of Pgp expression. C219 reactivity did not have an influence on remission duration.

The structure and pattern of expression of eight genes involved in cell division cycle control were studied in leukemic cell samples prepared from bone marrow of patients affected by chronic myelogenous leukemia. DESIGN AND METHODS: Ten cell preparations were obtained from patients in the chronic phase, five from those in myeloid blast crisis and five from those in the lymphoid acute phase. Moreover, bone marrow CD34+ cells, purified from healthy subjects and patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia (both during chronic and acute phases), were analyzed. The investigated genes were RB1, p53 and six cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor genes (p15INK4B, p16INK4A, p18INK4C, p21WAF1/CIP1, p27Kip1, p57Kip2). RESULTS: We found that none of these genes is structurally altered in either the chronic or acute phases, with the single exception of the p16INK4A gene, which was homozygously deleted in 1 case of lymphoid evolution. p57Kip2 expression is down-regulated during the evolution towards the blast crisis both in malignant and CD34+ cells. In addition, a significant up-regulation of p15INK4B gene expression is observable during the development of the acute phase of malignancy. INTERPRETATIONS AND CONCLUSIONS: The transcriptional modulation of some cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors might contribute to the fatal blast crisis of chronic myelogenous leukemia.","['Iolascon, A', 'Della Ragione, F', 'Giordani, L', 'Serra, A', 'Saglio, G', 'Faienza, M F']","['Iolascon A', 'Della Ragione F', 'Giordani L', 'Serra A', 'Saglio G', 'Faienza MF']","[""Dipartimento di Biomedicina dell'Eta Evolutiva, Universita di Bari, Italy. iolascon@percom.it""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,"['0 (CDKN1A protein, human)', '0 (CDKN2B protein, human)', '0 (CDKN2C protein, human)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p15)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p16)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p18)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21)', '0 (Cyclins)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Fungal Proteins)', '0 (KIP2 protein, S cerevisiae)', '0 (Microtubule-Associated Proteins)', '0 (Molecular Motor Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Retinoblastoma Protein)', '0 (Saccharomyces cerevisiae Proteins)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '147604-94-2 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p27)']",IM,"['Blast Crisis/genetics/metabolism', 'Bone Marrow Cells/metabolism', 'Carrier Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Cell Cycle/*genetics', 'Cell Cycle Proteins/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p15', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p16/*biosynthesis', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p18', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p27', 'Cyclins/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Disease Progression', '*Enzyme Inhibitors', 'Fungal Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Gene Deletion', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Genes, Retinoblastoma', '*Genes, p16', 'Genes, p53', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Microtubule-Associated Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Molecular Motor Proteins', 'Neoplasm Proteins/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Retinoblastoma Protein/biosynthesis', '*Saccharomyces cerevisiae Proteins', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/biosynthesis', '*Tumor Suppressor Proteins']",1998/11/24 00:00,1998/11/24 00:01,['1998/11/24 00:00'],"['1998/11/24 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/11/24 00:01 [medline]', '1998/11/24 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Haematologica. 1998 Sep;83(9):771-7.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Twenty-nine CML blast crises were analyzed. Seventeen were myeloid, 11 lymphoid and one biphenotypic. The blast crises were divided into subtypes as de novo acute leukaemias: of the 17 myeloid blast crises 6 were undifferentiated, 5 differentiated and 6 had monocytic differentiation. In the lymphoid blast crises there were no pro-B, 8 common-B and 3 mature-B. No T-lymphoid blast crises were observed. In 26/29 analyses (90%) CD34 was expressed in the blasts. In 17/29 analyses (59%) one or two aberrant markers were found. In summary, immunophenotyping is important in distinguishing between myeloid and lymphoid blast crises. A subclassification, as in acute leukaemias, is possible. We found no specific immunophenotypic CML pattern. A study directly comparing immunophenotyping of CML blast crises with acute de novo leukaemia is planned.","['Favre, G', 'Passweg, J', 'Hoffmann, T', 'Speck, B', 'Gratwohl, A', 'Tichelli, A']","['Favre G', 'Passweg J', 'Hoffmann T', 'Speck B', 'Gratwohl A', 'Tichelli A']","['Departement Innere Medizin, Kantonsspital Basel.']",['ger'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Switzerland,Schweiz Med Wochenschr,Schweizerische medizinische Wochenschrift,0404401,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Biomarkers)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antigens, CD34/blood', 'Biomarkers/blood', 'Blast Crisis/diagnosis/*immunology', 'Child', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Female', 'Humans', '*Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/classification/diagnosis/*immunology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged']",1998/11/24 00:00,1998/11/24 00:01,['1998/11/24 00:00'],"['1998/11/24 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/11/24 00:01 [medline]', '1998/11/24 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Schweiz Med Wochenschr. 1998 Oct 17;128(42):1624-6.,,,,,Immunphanotyp der Blastenkrise bei chronisch myeloischer Leukamie.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Swiss Study Group of Applied Cancer Research].,1593-7,"2-chlorodeoxyadenosine (2-CDA) is very effective in the treatment of patients with hairy-cell leukaemia, with an overall response rate of 80-95%. The standard treatment is a continuous intravenous infusion for 7 days. The bioavailability of 2-CDA after subcutaneous injection is 100%, but the concentration-time profile is completely different compared to continuous intravenous administration. In the present study we compared the intravenous standard treatment (group 1, n = 22; 0.1 mg/kg/d for 7 days, civ.) with subcutaneous administration of 2-CDA (group 2, n = 62; 0.14 mg/kg/d for 5 days, s.c.) in patients with hairy-cell leukaemia. In group 1, 96% (21/22) of patients responded to 2-CDA (complete remission 73%, partial remission 23%) and in the second group 97% were responsive (complete response 76%, 47/62; partial remission 21%, 13/62). The percentage for moderate and severe infections in the trial with intravenous and subcutaneous treatment was 14% and 26% respectively (p = 0.37). We conclude that subcutaneous administration of 2-CDA in patients with hairy-cell leukaemia is feasible and economical and results in comparable responses and toxicity compared to the intravenous standard treatment.","['Sperb, R A', 'von Rohr, A', 'Ratschiller, D', 'Bacchi, M', 'Tichelli, A', 'Hess, U', 'Cerny, T', 'Tobler, A', 'Betticher, D C']","['Sperb RA', 'von Rohr A', 'Ratschiller D', 'Bacchi M', 'Tichelli A', 'Hess U', 'Cerny T', 'Tobler A', 'Betticher DC']","['Institut fur Medizinische Onkologie, Inselspital Bern. roland.sperb@insel.ch']",['ger'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",Switzerland,Schweiz Med Wochenschr,Schweizerische medizinische Wochenschrift,0404401,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Deoxyadenosines)', '146-77-0 (2-Chloroadenosine)', ""JYW18Y92UP (2-chloro-3'-deoxyadenosine)""]",IM,"['2-Chloroadenosine/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*analogs & derivatives', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/*administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Cohort Studies', 'Deoxyadenosines/*administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infusions, Intravenous', 'Injections, Subcutaneous', 'Leukemia, Hairy Cell/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Pilot Projects', 'Prospective Studies', 'Remission Induction', 'Treatment Outcome']",1998/11/24 00:00,1998/11/24 00:01,['1998/11/24 00:00'],"['1998/11/24 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/11/24 00:01 [medline]', '1998/11/24 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Schweiz Med Wochenschr. 1998 Oct 17;128(42):1593-7.,,,,,2-CDA bei der Behandlung der Haarzell-Leukamie: ein Vergleich zwischen intravenoser und subkutaner Verabreichung.

The interaction of power-line electromagnetic fields with the human body.,67-73; discussion 73-8,"A detailed examination of the scientific foundations contained in a number of recent articles has revealed some serious errors. The careful application of advanced mathematical-physical methods to study the penetration of externally applied electric fields into the organs and cells of the human body has obtained new and significant results [8, 9, 32]. Specifically, Eqs. (11) and (12) establish a definite relationship between an incident low-frequency electric field and the current, current density, and electric field induced in the body when the arms are in contact with it and the incident field is parallel to its length. Corresponding formulas with the arms raised are available [10] as are formulas for the current density and electric field in the organs of the body [9]. It is these currents and electric fields that must be used by biomedical research workers to determine their effect on living cells. The proposed interpretation of epidemiological data [31] indicates a risk of leukemia in children when the incident 50-60-Hz electric field generated by a high-voltage transmission line is Einc > or = 61 V/m. (23). The corresponding maximum electric field at approximately 10 m from a 440-kV transmission line is Einc approximately 2100 V/m [8, 9]. The electric fields induced in the different organs of the body by these electric fields are in the range 25.2 < or = E1z < or = 119 microV/m for Einc2z = 61 V/m and 0.87 < or = E1z < or = 4.1 mV/m for Einc2z = 2100 V/m [9].

The study included a random selection of 46 newly diagnosed patients of childhood ALL from the Tata Memorial Hospital, Bombay, India. Similar to the frequency observed in other world regions, we found an All1 rearrangement in less than 7% (3/46) of pre B-ALL patients. In contrast to the 25% frequency reported for other regions the low risk molecular subtype characterized by the TEL/AML1 translocation represented a comparatively smaller fraction (4/46) in this study.

Based on evidence that the same cytokines can also promote committed osteoblast differentiation and stimulate bone formation in vitro and in vivo and that mesenchymal cell differentiation toward the osteoblast lineage may be a prerequisite for osteoclastogenesis, we have investigated whether gp130 activation can affect the differentiation of uncommitted mesenchymal progenitors. Using as our model murine embryonic fibroblasts (EF), we found that IL-6 or IL-11 in combination with their soluble receptors (sIL-6R or sIL-11R) increased dose-dependently the number of alkaline phosphatase (AP)-positive cells in 3-6-day-long cultures. Moreover, EF cells maintained with IL-6/sIL-6R in the presence of ascorbic acid and beta-glycerophosphate expressed osteocalcin messenger RNA (mRNA) by 2 weeks and formed a matrix containing mineralized collagen fibers by 3 weeks. This prodifferentiation effect was specific for the osteoblastic lineage, as we found no evidence for increased differentiation of chondrocytes, adipocytes, or muscle cells. Unlike IL-6/sIL-6R, LIF, oncostatin M (OSM), and ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF) did not promote osteoblastic differentiation of EF cells. This pattern of specificity was accounted for by the finding that EF cells express gp130, but not the ligand-binding subunit of the IL-6 receptor (gp80) nor the LIF receptor beta. These observations add credence to the contention that increased production of gp130-utilizing cytokines and their receptors in pathological conditions like sex steroid deficiency is indeed responsible for not only the increased osteoclastogenesis, but also the increased osteoblastogenesis, and thereby for the increased rate of bone remodeling.","['Taguchi, Y', 'Yamamoto, M', 'Yamate, T', 'Lin, S C', 'Mocharla, H', 'DeTogni, P', 'Nakayama, N', 'Boyce, B F', 'Abe, E', 'Manolagas, S C']","['Taguchi Y', 'Yamamoto M', 'Yamate T', 'Lin SC', 'Mocharla H', 'DeTogni P', 'Nakayama N', 'Boyce BF', 'Abe E', 'Manolagas SC']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Center for Osteoporosis and Metabolic Bone Diseases, and the McClellan VA GRECC, University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences, Little Rock 72205, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Proc Assoc Am Physicians,Proceedings of the Association of American Physicians,9514310,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (IL6ST protein, human)', '0 (Interleukin-11)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-6)', '133483-10-0 (Cytokine Receptor gp130)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD/*metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cytokine Receptor gp130', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-11/pharmacology', 'Interleukin-6/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/*metabolism', 'Mesoderm/*cytology', 'Osteoblasts/*cytology/drug effects/metabolism', 'Receptors, Interleukin-6/metabolism', 'Stem Cells']",1998/11/21 00:00,1998/11/21 00:01,['1998/11/21 00:00'],"['1998/11/21 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/11/21 00:01 [medline]', '1998/11/21 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Proc Assoc Am Physicians. 1998 Nov-Dec;110(6):559-74.,"['AR 41313/AR/NIAMS NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 AG139181/AG/NIA NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, we examined human sera for the presence of alternatively spliced soluble IL-6R (AS-sIL-6R). We produced a monoclonal antibody (mAb) recognizing the unique sequence of AS-sIL-6R peptide, generated by an altered reading frame. We also made recombinant AS-sIL-6R protein in Spodoptera frugiperda-9 (Sf-9) cells carrying baculovirus, which encoded altered sIL-6R or conventional IL-6R cDNA. mAbs specifically recognized AS-sIL-6R, but not conventional IL-6R, as demonstrated by Western blot analyses, fluorescence-activated cell sorter, immunofluorescence analyses and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). We adapted an ELISA system and used it for detection of altered sIL-6R in sera from 23 healthy persons, 12 patients with adult T-cell leukaemia (ATL) and 13 patients with HTLV-I-associated myelopathy (HAM). Serum levels of AS-sIL-6R were 6.4 or 6.1 times greater in ATL (28.7+/-20.4 ng/ml, P<0.0001) and in HAM patients (27.5+/-12.1 ng/ml, P<0.0001) than in healthy individuals (4.5+/-2.1 ng/ml). High levels of AS-sIL-6R were also observed in plasma from rheumatoid arthritis patients and in persons with elevated levels of alanine aminotransferase (ALT), antinuclear antibody (ANA), or alpha-fetoprotein (AFP). However, in human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1), hepatitis B virus (HBV) or hepatitis C virus (HCV)-infected individuals, AS-sIL-6R levels were not elevated. In this study, we confirmed that AS-sIL-6R is indeed present in human sera. These observations suggest that alternative splicing of IL-6R mRNA is of consequence in ATL, HAM and in some autoimmune diseases. The HTLV-I-infected T cells appeared to play an important role in AS-sIL-6R production.","['Horiuchi, S', 'Ampofo, W', 'Koyanagi, Y', 'Yamashita, A', 'Waki, M', 'Matsumoto, A', 'Yamamoto, M', 'Yamamoto, N']","['Horiuchi S', 'Ampofo W', 'Koyanagi Y', 'Yamashita A', 'Waki M', 'Matsumoto A', 'Yamamoto M', 'Yamamoto N']","['Departments of Microbiology & Molecular Virology, Faculty of Medicine, Tokyo Medical and Dental University, Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Immunology,Immunology,0374672,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-6)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)']",IM,"['Adult', '*Alternative Splicing', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/immunology', 'Arthritis, Rheumatoid/immunology', 'Baculoviridae/genetics', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'DNA, Complementary/genetics', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique, Indirect', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/*immunology', 'Paraparesis, Tropical Spastic/*immunology', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Receptors, Interleukin-6/*biosynthesis/blood/genetics', 'Recombinant Proteins/biosynthesis', 'Solubility']",1998/11/21 00:00,1998/11/21 00:01,['1998/11/21 00:00'],"['1998/11/21 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/11/21 00:01 [medline]', '1998/11/21 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1046/j.1365-2567.1998.00622.x [doi]'],ppublish,Immunology. 1998 Nov;95(3):360-9. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2567.1998.00622.x.,,,PMC1364401,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The findings provide evidence of an association between work as a painter and risk of cancer, although the confounding effects of smoking and alcohol cannot be entirely excluded, especially with respect to liver cancer since deaths from cirrhosis were also increased. The excess deaths from leukemia could have been from exposure to benzene mixed with other organic solvents, while that from lung cancer may be from exposure to particles containing lead chromate and to asbestos in the paint trade.

Spermine also induced the accumulation of cytochrome c in the cytosol. Caspase activation triggered by spermine was not blocked by antioxidants or inhibition of polyamine oxidase.

Cytogenetically unrelated clones were observed in 13 patients: 11 patients with two unrelated clones, one patient with three unrelated clones, and one patient with four unrelated clones. Twelve cases of unrelated clones presented as t-MDS, whereas only one case presented as overt t-AML. Partial or complete deletions of the long arms or monosomy for chromosome 5 or chromosome 7, which are characteristic of t-MDS and t-AML, were observed in both unrelated clones in four patients and in one unrelated clone only in six patients, whereas three patients showed aberrations in both clones that were uncharacteristic of t-MDS or t-AML. Three different interpretations of the origin and significance of cytogenetically unrelated clones in t-MDS and t-AML are presented, although the disease is still considered to be monoclonal. First, patients with different defects of the long arm of chromosome 5 or chromosome 7 in two unrelated clones often seem to have acquired these aberrations as independent events. For this reason, it is possible that they may play an important role in leukemic transformation, for instance, by activating or potentiating the effect of a genetic change that is present in all cells but not disclosed as a visible chromosome abnormality. In cases with involvement of other chromosomes, unrelated clones sometimes develop by cytogenetic change in only a subclone of cells, indicating that they play a role only in tumor progression. Finally, unrelated clones in t-MDS and t-AML may represent two different monoclonal diseases: the primary tumor and t-MDS. This view is supported by the significant excess of unrelated clones observed in t-MDS following multiple myeloma (4 in 13 cases) compared with other diseases (9 in 167 cases; P = 0.02), and by results from a case with a balanced translocation that is highly characteristic of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma in one clone and a t-MDS-associated deletion of the long arm of chromosome 5 in another.","['Pedersen-Bjergaard, J', 'Timshel, S', 'Andersen, M K', 'Andersen, A S', 'Philip, P']","['Pedersen-Bjergaard J', 'Timshel S', 'Andersen MK', 'Andersen AS', 'Philip P']","['Department of Hematology L, The Finsen Center, Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen, Denmark.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Genes Chromosomes Cancer,"Genes, chromosomes & cancer",9007329,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Child', 'Clone Cells', 'Cohort Studies', 'Denmark', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*genetics/pathology', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/*genetics/pathology']",1998/11/21 03:04,2000/06/20 09:00,['1998/11/21 03:04'],"['1998/11/21 03:04 [pubmed]', '2000/06/20 09:00 [medline]', '1998/11/21 03:04 [entrez]']","['10.1002/(SICI)1098-2264(199812)23:4<337::AID-GCC9>3.0.CO;2-L [pii]', '10.1002/(sici)1098-2264(199812)23:4<337::aid-gcc9>3.0.co;2-l [doi]']",ppublish,Genes Chromosomes Cancer. 1998 Dec;23(4):337-49. doi: 10.1002/(sici)1098-2264(199812)23:4<337::aid-gcc9>3.0.co;2-l.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the sequence of changes that occur in the mitochondria in the initial step of apoptosis has not been clearly elucidated. Here, we showed that mitochondrial respiratory chain (MRC) complex I was inhibited during the early phase of TNF- or serum withdrawal apoptosis. The importance of complex I inhibition in apoptosis is also supported by the observation that rotenone, an inhibitor of complex I but not that of other complexes, could induce apoptosis in a manner comparable to TNF. We hypothesized that inhibition of complex I could affect electron flow through other complexes leading to cytochrome c release by an antioxidant-sensitive pathway and caspase 3 activation followed by the induction of membrane permeability transition (MPT). This hypothesis is supported by the following observations: (1) TNF and rotenone induced MPT and cytochrome c release; (2) TNF-induced complex I inhibition was observed prior to cytochrome c release and MPT induction; (3) MPT induction was inhibited by a caspase 3 inhibitor, z-DEVD-CH2F, and an antioxidant pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate (PDTC), whereas cytochrome c release was only inhibited by PDTC.

Potentiation of MTIC cytotoxicity by a delayed exposure to NU1025 was equally effective as by a simultaneous exposure to NU1025, indicating that the effects of NU1025 were mediated by an inhibition of the cellular recovery. The recovery from potentially lethal gamma-irradiation damage cytotoxicity in plateau-phase cells was also inhibited by NU1025. Investigation of DNA strand breakage and repair in gamma-irradiated cells by alkaline elution demonstrated that NU1025 caused a marked retardation of DNA repair. A structurally different PARP inhibitor, NU1064 (2-methylbenzimidazole-4-carboxamide), also potentiated the cytotoxicity of MTIC, to a similar extent to NU1025. NU1064 potentiated a sublethal concentration of a DNA methylating agent in a concentration-dependent manner.

The rationale of this work was to determine whether signal cross-talk could be used to decrease the pharmacological doses of retinoids in the treatment of APL. When only the basal level of adenylate-cyclase (AC) activity is present in NB4 cells, up to 1 microM concentration of all-trans retinoic acid (RA) is required for full maturation (100%). In these conditions, with only 10 nM RA less than 20% of cells will differentiate. Although the use of membrane receptor agonists to activate AC has been proved to synergize with RA treatment, these agents were never as potent as cell permeant cAMP analogues. Analogues have disadvantages since cleavage by serum and cellular phosphodiesterases generates metabolites which interfere in cellular response. In the present study, we observed cell maturation by engrafting an autonomous Bordetella pertussis AC which steadily delivers natural cAMP into the cell. The enzyme alone had no effect on cell maturation. Importantly, cell maturation was increased in a dose-dependent manner when the bacterial AC (1 ng/ml to 1 microg/ml) was used to potentiate the effects of low doses RA (10 nM). More than 50% of cells matured with only 10 nM of RA and 200 ng/ml of B. pertussis AC. The maturation response was significantly increased when lower amounts of enzyme were repetitively added to the culture to compensate for enzymatic decay. These results indicate that a sustained AC activity enhanced cell maturation. We were able to reduce to 3 nM the RA requirement, provided that a minimal amount (20 ng/ml) of B. pertussis AC was added every 12 h in culture. Membrane signalling maintaining high the level of cAMP substantially improved the efficacy of APL cell maturation by retinoids. Therefore, therapeutic benefits are expected by lowering the concentration of RA towards physiological (nanomolar) levels, thus reducing the side-effects of the drug. cAMP-elevating drugs that act on a post-cyclase target (cyclic-nucleotide phosphodiesterases) or cell-targeted drug carriers (cAMP and RA loaded liposomes) should be evaluated as maturation therapies combining the activation of multiple signalling pathways.","[""Quenech'Du, N"", 'Ruchaud, S', 'Khelef, N', 'Guiso, N', 'Lanotte, M']","[""Quenech'Du N"", 'Ruchaud S', 'Khelef N', 'Guiso N', 'Lanotte M']","[""INSERM U-496, Institut Universitaire d'Hematologie, Hopital Saint-Louis, Paris, France.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'E0399OZS9N (Cyclic AMP)']",IM,"['Cyclic AMP/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/metabolism/*pathology', 'Signal Transduction', 'Tretinoin/*physiology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1998/11/21 00:00,1998/11/21 00:01,['1998/11/21 00:00'],"['1998/11/21 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/11/21 00:01 [medline]', '1998/11/21 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2401171 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 1998 Nov;12(11):1829-33. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2401171.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To understand the significance of these proteins in fresh human myeloma cells, expression of Bcl-2 family of proteins was analyzed by Western blotting in 17 cases with multiple myeloma (MM) and three cases with plasma cell leukemia (PCL). Bcl-2 and Bcl-X(L) were found in 12 and nine samples, respectively. All PCL cases showed co-expression of Bcl-2 and Bcl-X(L). Analysis of MM cases showed that Bcl-2 was preferentially expressed in samples from cases with early clinical stage while Bcl-X(L) tended to be expressed in samples from cases at advanced clinical stage. Bcl-X(L) was significantly expressed in tumor cells from cases with extramedullar lesions. There was no correlation between the expression levels of Bcl-2 or Bcl-X(L) and preceding chemotherapy. Expression of Bax was found in only one patient who had pleural effusion caused by invasion of myeloma cells and a high serum LDH level. Survival analysis revealed that there was no statistical significance in expression of Bcl-2 or Bcl-X(L) although Bcl-X(L) tended to be expressed in cases with poor prognosis. These findings indicate that expression of Bcl-2 family of proteins is heterogeneously regulated in fresh myeloma cells. Expression of Bcl-X(L) and Bcl-2 may correlate with extramedullar invasion and early stage of the disease, respectively. Absence of Bax in myeloma cells may contribute to low sensitivity of myeloma cells to anti-cancer agents since Bax is reported to mediate cytotoxicity of some anti-cancer drugs.","['Harada, N', 'Hata, H', 'Yoshida, M', 'Soniki, T', 'Nagasaki, A', 'Kuribayashi, N', 'Kimura, T', 'Matsuzaki, H', 'Mitsuya, H']","['Harada N', 'Hata H', 'Yoshida M', 'Soniki T', 'Nagasaki A', 'Kuribayashi N', 'Kimura T', 'Matsuzaki H', 'Mitsuya H']","['Second Department of Internal Medicine, Kumamoto University School of Medicine, Honjo, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,['0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)'],IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Plasma Cell/*metabolism', 'Middle Aged', 'Multiple Myeloma/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*metabolism']",1998/11/21 00:00,1998/11/21 00:01,['1998/11/21 00:00'],"['1998/11/21 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/11/21 00:01 [medline]', '1998/11/21 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2401168 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 1998 Nov;12(11):1817-20. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2401168.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To explore a second independent tumor marker, we used specific PCR primer sets to identify tumor-specific rearranged Ig light chain (IgL) genes. Rearranged IgL genes were amplified from lymphoma DNA by multiplex PCR using separate primer sets for the Igkappa and the Iglambda genes. They were considered to be of tumor origin if they were monoclonal, and if the same rearrangement was isolated from at least two independent PCR products. From 12 out of 13 intermediate- and high-grade malignant NHL, PCR products could be obtained with IgL specific primers. PCR products from five NHL were studied in detail by cloning and sequencing. The rearranged IgL genes showed 85-100% homology with their closest germ line counterparts. Intraclonal IgL sequence heterogeneity was studied in five lymphomas and detected in only one. Minimal disease was studied in three patients by PCR, followed by Southern hybridization of the PCR product with a lymphoma-specific oligonucleotide probe, which allowed for detection of lymphoma DNA following 1000-fold dilution. Blood samples from one patient, who is in long-term clinical remission, were negative for the lymphoma-specific rearranged Igkappa gene. In the second patient the rearranged Iglambda gene was detected during the first clinical remission, that was followed by a nodal relapse, but not during the second remission, that has been stable for almost 3 years now. The third patient was negative for the rearranged Iglambda gene in blood samples up to 102 months after diagnosis. Circulating lymphoma cells were detected in blood and bone marrow samples which were negative by morphological and immunological criteria.

It was first isolated from Kaposi's sarcoma tumor cells and subsequently from tumor cells and peripheral blood mononuclear cells from patients with primary effusion lymphomas (PEL; or body cavity-based lymphomas). PEL has been recognized as an individual nosologic entity based on its distinctive biological-pathological features and its consistent infection with HHV-8 (commonly, but not always co-infected with EBV), occurring predominantly in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients but occasionally also in HIV-negative cases. Whether HHV-8 sequences can be found also in non-hematopoietic tumor cells other than Kaposi's sarcoma and in malignant hematopoietic malignancies other than PEL, has been the focus of the present studies. We examined the presence of HHV-8 sequences by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using (1) a panel of 133 human cell lines established from a large variety of solid tumors; (2) a spectrum of 114 hematopoietic cell lines derived from the different cell lineages including 50 B cell leukemia/lymphoma-derived cell lines and seven cell lines established from patients with PEL. Besides the seven PEL cell lines, 46 cell lines that were derived from malignant pleural effusion or ascitic fluid material (25 non-hematopoietic and 21 hematopoietic cell lines) were examined. Except for the seven PEL cell lines that were strongly HHV-8+ in the PCR, all solid tumor cell lines and all hematopoietic cell lines scored consistently negative for the presence of HHV-8 sequences. These results confirm the absolute specificity of HHV-8 infection (within the hematopoietic malignancies) for PEL.

The C-terminus of the latent membrane protein 1 (LMP-1) of EBV is essential for transformation and the 30-bp deletion detected in this region has been implicated to be associated with a more aggressive malignant phenotype. To understand the molecular mechanisms underlying EBV pathogenesis in BL of Turkish children, we analyzed 30-bp deletion and 33-bp variable repeat regions of the LMP-1 gene from paraffin-embedded tumor tissues of 30 BL patients (mean age 5.9 years). Primer pairs spanning the 30-bp deletion and 33-bp repeat regions were designed for amplification by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The PCR-amplified products were analyzed by gel electrophoresis, Southern blot hybridization, and DNA sequencing. Twenty-eight (93%) of 30 BL biopsy samples were EBV positive as determined by PCR. Variable copy numbers (ranging from 4.5 to 7) of the 33-bp repeat of LMP-1 gene were detected in these EBV-containing tumor samples. To determine the frequency of the 30-bp deletion of the LMP-1 gene, we sequenced the amplimers encompassing this region. Analyses of DNA sequence of 28 Turkish BLs have disclosed four patterns: the first (32% (9/28)) is identical to B95-8 with no deletion, the second (11% (3/28)) is identical to Asian NPC CAO strain with 30-bp deletion, the third (46% (13/28)) is prevalent in Turkish BLs with a longer deletion (69 bp), and the fourth (11% (3/28)) consists of a mixture of 30-bp and 69-bp deletion. The occurrence of high frequency of the 69-bp deletion appears to have no correlation with the disease site. Mutations found in the CAO strain were also detected in the Turkish BL clustering at the amino acids 322, 334, 338 and 342; whereas mutations specific for Turkish BL were clustered at amino acids 326, 352 and 361. To assess the EBV genotype with the changes in C-terminus of LMP-1 gene, we performed genotyping by PCR to differentiate type A and B strain. All 28 patients were infected by type A EBV. Such a high frequency of the larger size (69 bp) deletion has never been reported. Ascertaining the role of this deletion in BL pathogenesis will require further study.","['Tacyildiz, N', 'Cavdar, A O', 'Ertem, U', 'Oksal, A', 'Kutluay, L', 'Uluoglu, O', 'Lin, J C']","['Tacyildiz N', 'Cavdar AO', 'Ertem U', 'Oksal A', 'Kutluay L', 'Uluoglu O', 'Lin JC']","['Dr Sami Ulus Children Hospital Department of Pediatric Oncology, Ankara, Turkey.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (EBV-associated membrane antigen, Epstein-Barr virus)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Viral)', '0 (Viral Matrix Proteins)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Base Sequence', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/ethnology/*genetics', 'Child', 'DNA, Viral', 'Genotype', 'Herpesvirus 4, Human/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Oncogene Proteins, Viral/*genetics', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Sequence Deletion', 'Turkey', 'Viral Matrix Proteins/*genetics']",1998/11/21 00:00,1998/11/21 00:01,['1998/11/21 00:00'],"['1998/11/21 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/11/21 00:01 [medline]', '1998/11/21 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2401203 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 1998 Nov;12(11):1796-805. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2401203.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Normal human bone marrow cells were separated into three bands by density gradient centrifugation. Band 1 contains band and segmented cells, band 2 mainly myelocytes, metamyelocytes and some band cells, and band 3 myeloblasts and promyelocytes in addition to megakaryocytes and proerythroblasts. Cells from these bands, as well as undifferentiated HL-60 cells, were pulsed with radiolabeled cysteine and methionine, and biosynthesis of granule proteins was subsequently evaluated by immunoprecipitation and quantified by phosphorimaging. Myeloperoxidase synthesis was maximal in cells from band 3 while defensin biosynthesis was maximal in cells from band 2. Lysozyme was synthesized in cells from all bands but was maximal in cells from band 2. These results are in agreement with our hypothesis that timing of biosynthesis determines the localization of individual granule proteins. While myeloperoxidase and defensins were efficiently retained in immature cells (band 3), a significant fraction of lysozyme was routed out of the cells, showing that differences exist in the sorting of granule proteins between constitutive and regulated secretion. In addition, defensin was less efficiently retained in cells from band 2 than from band 3, indicating that sorting mechanisms may depend on the stage of cell maturation.","['Arnljots, K', 'Sorensen, O', 'Lollike, K', 'Borregaard, N']","['Arnljots K', 'Sorensen O', 'Lollike K', 'Borregaard N']","['Department of Hematology, University Hospital, Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen, Denmark.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Defensins)', 'EC 1.11.1.7 (Peroxidase)', 'EC 3.2.1.17 (Muramidase)']",IM,"['Bone Marrow Cells/*cytology/enzymology/metabolism', 'Cytoplasmic Granules/enzymology/metabolism', 'Defensins', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Muramidase/*biosynthesis', 'Peroxidase/*biosynthesis', '*Protein Biosynthesis', 'Subcellular Fractions']",1998/11/21 00:00,1998/11/21 00:01,['1998/11/21 00:00'],"['1998/11/21 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/11/21 00:01 [medline]', '1998/11/21 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2401202 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 1998 Nov;12(11):1789-95. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2401202.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Growth in all phenotypic fractions was measured in a single cell assay, which enabled quantification of plating efficiency, colony size and determination of progenitor cell origin. No growth was observed in the CD34-negative fraction. In the CD34+, lineage-positive fraction only clusters up to 20 cells were found in 6/8 samples.

It results in a TEL-AML1 rearrangement and is associated with a good prognosis. Because many chromosomal alterations in leukemia are associated with distinct cell surface phenotypes, we investigated whether there was an association seen between surface marker expression and the TEL-AML1 rearrangement. Of 166 unselected cases of B-precursor ALL studied by Southern hybridization, 45 cases (27%) showed TEL rearrangement. Blasts of patients with TEL rearrangement were much more likely to be CD9-negative, CD45-positive, CD13 positive, and CD20 negative, but the predictive value of any of these markers for the rearrangement was very low. However, 93% of patients with the TEL rearrangement had blasts that were either negative or only partly positive for CD9; this phenotype was only seen in 27% of patients without the rearrangement. Only information about CD20 expression added to the predictive value of CD9 alone. The predictive value of the phenotype CD9 (negative or partly positive) and CD20 (negative or partly positive), for the TEL rearrangement was prospectively tested on an additional 223 cases, and found to be 88% sensitive and 71% specific for the rearrangement, with a positive predictive value of 47%. Hyperdiploidy, previously shown to correlate negatively with the rearrangement, was a slightly more sensitive indicator (94%) but had a much lower predictive value (28%). Three of eight cases found to be rearranged by Southern hybridization but lacking the characteristic phenotype failed to show evidence of the TEL-AML1 rearrangement by polymerase chain reaction, suggesting that at least some of the discordant cases may involve partner genes other than AML1 in the TEL rearrangement. We conclude that immunophenotyping is highly predictive of the TEL rearrangement. For every 100 patients with B-precursor ALL, we estimate that prescreening by phenotyping would eliminate the need for molecular testing on 57 patients and only two or three of an expected 24 patients with the TEL rearrangement would not be detected.","['Borowitz, M J', 'Rubnitz, J', 'Nash, M', 'Pullen, D J', 'Camitta, B']","['Borowitz MJ', 'Rubnitz J', 'Nash M', 'Pullen DJ', 'Camitta B']","['Johns Hopkins Medical Institutions, Baltimore, MD, USA.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antigens, Surface)', '0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (TEL-AML1 fusion protein)']",IM,"['Antigens, Surface/*immunology', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/*genetics', 'Child', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit', '*Gene Rearrangement', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*genetics', '*Oncogene Proteins, Fusion', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics/immunology', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Translocation, Genetic']",1998/11/21 00:00,1998/11/21 00:01,['1998/11/21 00:00'],"['1998/11/21 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/11/21 00:01 [medline]', '1998/11/21 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2401177 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 1998 Nov;12(11):1764-70. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2401177.,"['CA15989/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA28476/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA31566/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",['Leukemia. 1999 Jun;13(6):981-3.

The Bcl-2 protein may function as a modulator of Fas-induced apoptosis by blocking a downstream activation step, and Bcl-2 expression in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) cells appears to depend partly on expression of a wild-type (wt) p53 tumor suppressor gene (Findley et al, Blood 1997; 89: 2986). We therefore investigated the relationship between sensitivity to Fas-mediated apoptosis and (1) Fas expression, (2) p53 status, and (3) Bcl-2 protein levels in pediatric ALL cell lines and primary leukemic cells. Cell lines included 21 B cell precursor (BCP)-ALL and four T-ALL lines; in five cases, cryopreserved primary leukemic cells from which these lines were established were also examined. Additionally, we evaluated the effect of anti-Fas monoclonal antibody on the activation of protease CPP32 and induction of apoptosis in these lines. By SSCP analysis and DNA sequencing, we detected p53 mutations (mt) in eight out of 25 ALL cell lines (exon-7, codon 248 n=6; exon-8, codon 273, n=2). The expression of Fas and Bcl-2 was examined by immunofluorescence staining and quantified as the number of molecules of equivalent soluble fluorochrome (MESF). Elevated levels of Fas were expressed in all six lines with a mutation of p53 in codon 248 (1500 to 10800 MESF). Although Fas was detectable in seven of the 17 lines with wt-p53, expression was lower (150-900 MESF) compared with mt-p53+ lines. Bcl-2 was expressed in 10 of the 25 lines. Most (9/10) wt-p53+ lines expressed Bcl-2, whereas only one of eight mt-p53+ lines and no p53-null lines expressed this protein. Treatment of Fas-positive lines with anti-Fas monoclonal antibody (200 ng/ml) for 6 h induced activation of CPP32 and apoptosis in eight of 13 Fas+ lines. Sensitivity to Fas-mediated apoptosis was associated with a mt-p53 phenotype and absence of Bcl-2 expression. Six of eight Fas+/Fas-sensitive (S) lines were mt-53+/Bcl-2-, whereas only two Fas+/Fas-S lines were wt-p53+/Bcl-2+; both of these latter lines expressed low levels of Bcl-2 compared to Fas-resistant lines. In contrast, four of five Fas+/Fas-resistant (R) lines were wt-p53+/Bcl-2+; the exception was p53-null/Bcl-2- but expressed a low level of Fas (150 MESF). Activation of the cysteine protease CPP32 and cleavage of its substrate poly(ADP-ribose)polymerase (PARP) was also detected in Fas-S but not Fas-R lines. We obtained similar results from both the primary leukemic cells and the corresponding cell lines in five cases: overexpression of Fas and Fas-sensitivity were present in mt-p53+/Bcl-2- but not wt-p53+/Bcl-2+ cells. These results suggest that some pediatric ALL cells expressing mt-p53+ may be sensitive to Fas-mediated apoptosis due to high levels of Fas expression and lack of Bcl-2, and further suggest that molecular methods of activating Fas may be useful for therapy of refractory ALL with the Fas+/mt-p53+ phenotype.","['Zhou, M', 'Gu, L', 'Yeager, A M', 'Findley, H W']","['Zhou M', 'Gu L', 'Yeager AM', 'Findley HW']","['Division of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology/Bone Marrow Transplantation, Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, GA 30322, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (fas Receptor)', 'EC 2.4.2.30 (Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",IM,"['*Apoptosis', 'Caspase 3', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Child', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Flow Cytometry', '*Genes, p53', 'Humans', 'Hydrolysis', 'Mutation', 'Phenotype', 'Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases/metabolism', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/enzymology/genetics/*pathology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*genetics', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'fas Receptor/*physiology']",1998/11/21 00:00,1998/11/21 00:01,['1998/11/21 00:00'],"['1998/11/21 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/11/21 00:01 [medline]', '1998/11/21 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2401198 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 1998 Nov;12(11):1756-63. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2401198.,['R29 CA72020-02/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Preliminary studies in humans have demonstrated tumor regression in patients with Kaposi's sarcoma given intralesional injections of HCG. To further evaluate HCG's antitumor activity we conducted in vitro and clinical evaluations of HCG in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). In HL-60 leukemic cell lines, a 20-40% inhibition of cell density was demonstrated by trypan blue exclusion method at low concentrations of an HCG preparation (2 x 10(-3)-2 x 10(-2)). Similar concentrations also resulted in a reduction in the proportion of cells in G2M phase of the cell cycle, as well as enhanced differentiation compared to control cells. Fifteen patients with advanced AML with marrow blast counts >30%, and five with marrow blast counts between 10 and 26% were given daily subcutaneous injections of HCG 2-4 IU and oral levamisole 50 mg weekly. Five patients with absolute blast counts in the blood ranging from 0 to 3500/microl and percent blasts in the marrow ranging from 16 to 81% were observed to have no progressive increase in either marrow or peripheral blast counts for 70-121 days. One patient with a pretreatment blast count of 10% in the marrow, no circulating blasts and minor cytopenias had a decrease in marrow blasts to less than 5% which has persisted at 550 days. No significant improvement from baseline levels of neutrophils, hemoglobin or platelets were observed in any nl the patients treated. Increases in apoptotic cell death were observed in over 50% of patients' cells with some demonstrating peak levels similar to experiences in patients treated with DNA-damaging chemotherapy. A decreased expression of bcl-2 was seen in the majority of patients ranging from 6 to 62%. These new observations suggest that HCG preparations may inhibit leukemic cell growth through enhancement of cell death mechanisms and could be used in judicious combinations with other approaches. The results confirm the pro-apoptotic effects of HCG preparations reported in patients with Kaposi's sarcoma. Identification of the active component of HCG preparations and further understanding of its growth modulatory action will be important in its development as a clinically useful agent.","['Feldman, E J', 'Seiter, K', 'Chiao, J W', 'Halicka, H D', 'Traganos, F', 'Fatora, S R', 'McMichael, J', 'Baskind, P', 'Goff, H', 'Beer, M', 'Ahmed, T', 'Darzynkiewicz, Z']","['Feldman EJ', 'Seiter K', 'Chiao JW', 'Halicka HD', 'Traganos F', 'Fatora SR', 'McMichael J', 'Baskind P', 'Goff H', 'Beer M', 'Ahmed T', 'Darzynkiewicz Z']","['Zalmen A Arlin Cancer Research Institute, Westchester County Medical Center, New York Medical College, Valhalla 10595, USA.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Chorionic Gonadotropin)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Apoptosis', 'Chorionic Gonadotropin/*therapeutic use', 'Drug Evaluation', 'Female', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'Treatment Outcome']",1998/11/21 00:00,1998/11/21 00:01,['1998/11/21 00:00'],"['1998/11/21 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/11/21 00:01 [medline]', '1998/11/21 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2401196 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 1998 Nov;12(11):1749-55. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2401196.,"['R01 CA028704/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA028704-20/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA28704/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have studied the effects of these agents in vitro on cells from 12 patients with other forms of acute myeloblastic leukaemia (AML). Treatment with KH1060 (10(-6) M) caused decreases in cell viability in suspension culture to a median of 44% of control values (P=0.02). However, retinoids had little effect. Subsequent clonal growth in semi-solid medium was inhibited to 5% (median) of control with 10(-6) M KH 1060 (P=0.03) and to 73% with 10(-6) M 9-cRA (P=0.01). Further inhibition of clonal growth by the combination of 5 x 10(-7) M 9-cRA and 5 x 10(-7) M KH1060 was only noted in one case. Following the primary suspension culture, cells from 6/6 CD34 positive samples grew in semi-solid cultures without analogues, whereas cells from 3/6 CD34 negative cultures grew. 10(-6) M KH1060 completely abolished colony growth in all three CD34 negative samples and 10(-6) M 9-cRA inhibited the number of colonies to a median of 11% of control values. In the six CD34 positive samples median colony growth was inhibited to 36% of control values by KH1060 and to 83% of control values by 9-cRA. CD11b expression was increased by 210% (median) with 9-cRA and by 90% (median) with KH1060 in early to intermediate myeloblast (M0, M1, M2) clones. A different pattern was noted in more mature (M4, M5, M6) clones: here there was little or no increase in CD11b expression induced by retinoids or KH1060, but the ratio of apoptotic to viable CD11b+ cells, measured by CD11b/7-AAD double staining, was increased in 6/6 cases treated with KH1060 or the combination of 9-cRA and KH 1060, and in 5/6 cases treated with 9-cRA. No overall significant change in bcl-2 or bax expression on G0/G1 cells was found after 3 days' suspension culture with the analogues. However bcl-x was downregulated in G0/G1 cells treated with KH1060 (median bcl-x relative fluorescence intensity = 45.3 in cells treated with KH1060, compared with 65.7 in control wells, P=0.028). We conclude that CD34+ samples are relatively resistant to the growth inhibition induced by KH1060 and 9-cRA. However, downregulation of bcl-x in cells which have survived treatment with KH1060 may increase the susceptibility of the remaining leukaemic cells to cytotoxic drugs.","['Pallis, M', 'Turzanski, J', 'Russell, N H']","['Pallis M', 'Turzanski J', 'Russell NH']","['Department of Haematology, Nottingham City Hospital and University of Nottingham, UK.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (BAX protein, human)', '0 (BCL2L1 protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', '0 (bcl-X Protein)', '131875-08-6 (KH 1060)', '1UA8E65KDZ (Alitretinoin)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'FXC9231JVH (Calcitriol)']",IM,"['Alitretinoin', 'Antigens, CD34/*immunology', 'Apoptosis', 'Calcitriol/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Division', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/immunology/metabolism/*pathology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'Tretinoin/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein', 'bcl-X Protein']",1998/11/21 00:00,1998/11/21 00:01,['1998/11/21 00:00'],"['1998/11/21 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/11/21 00:01 [medline]', '1998/11/21 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2401197 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 1998 Nov;12(11):1741-8. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2401197.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

JEM-1 is kept silent in the APL cell line NB4, but up-regulated (3 kb transcript) during cell maturation. Here, we show that retinoic acid (RA)-induced JEM-1 expression is biphasic (peaks at 6 h and 48 h) and associated with the later stages of maturation. Retinoids, which cooperates with cAMP to induce maturation, also cooperates with cAMP to up-regulate JEM-1, either in maturation-responsive NB4 cells or in NB4-R1 resistant subclones. APL patients showed a low, yet variable, level of JEM-1 mRNA in bone marrow. RA treatment induced an increase in the level of JEM-1 mRNA, as detected by a semi-quantitative PCR. This increase can result from both gene up-regulation or replacement of leukemia cells by differentiated ones. Analysis of JEM-1 expression patterns in normal and tumor cells revealed that JEM-1 expression was ubiquitous. Cell lines derived from monocytic and erythroid leukemias, expressed low and high amounts of JEM-1 mRNA, respectively. Using a JEM cDNA probe, distinct profiles of expression and different transcript sizes (4 kb, 3 kb and 2 kb) were also identified in tumour and normal non-hematopoietic tissues, while interestingly only the 3kb transcript was up-regulated in NB4 cells. This work identifies JEM-1 as a novel ubiquitous gene whose expression is low in APL cells, but can be restored by RA treatment, concomitant with cell maturation.","['Tong, J H', 'Fant, X', 'Duprez, E', 'Benoit, G', 'Uphoff, C C', 'Drexler, H G', 'Pla, J C', 'Lofvenberg, E', 'Lanotte, M']","['Tong JH', 'Fant X', 'Duprez E', 'Benoit G', 'Uphoff CC', 'Drexler HG', 'Pla JC', 'Lofvenberg E', 'Lanotte M']","[""Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale, INSERM-U496, Institut Universitaire d'Hematologie, Hopital Saint-Louis, Paris, France.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (BLZF1 protein, human)', '0 (Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Leucine Zipper Transcription Factors)', '0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Retinoids)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Base Sequence', 'Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Leucine Zipper Transcription Factors', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 1', 'DNA Primers', 'Fetus', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*genetics/pathology', 'Nuclear Proteins/*genetics', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'RNA, Messenger/*genetics/metabolism', 'Retinoids/*pharmacology', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1998/11/21 00:00,1998/11/21 00:01,['1998/11/21 00:00'],"['1998/11/21 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/11/21 00:01 [medline]', '1998/11/21 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2401173 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 1998 Nov;12(11):1733-40. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2401173.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recently, we have demonstrated that HOXC4 and HOXC6, but not HOXC5, are expressed during lymphoid differentiation. Reports on the expression of these genes in myeloid leukemias and normal myeloid cells are still scarce. Therefore, we have investigated the expression of HOXC4, HOXC5 and HOXC6 in purified subpopulations of bone marrow in addition to 36 specimens of acute myeloid leukemias (AMLs), eight chronic myeloid leukemias (CMLs), several myeloid cell lines and cutaneous localizations of three myelomonocytic leukemias and one granulocytic sarcoma by RT-PCR and partly by RNA in situ hybridization (RISH). HOXC4 and HOXC6 transcripts were both detected by RT-PCR in 22/36 and 24/36 AMLs, respectively. The distribution of HOXC4 and HOXC6 gene expression over the different types of AML was largely similar and covered all types of AML. In contrast, HOXC5 gene expression was found in only 6/32 AMLs. Expression of HOXC5 was restricted to AMLs of the granulocytic (FAB M1-M3), early monocytic (FAB M4) and early erythroid (FAB M6) lineage. In general, except in one FAB M5b case, no expression of HOXC5 was found in AMLs derived from late stages of monocytic (FAB M5) and megakaryocytic (FAB M7) lineages. As for HOXC4 and HOXC6, expression of HOXC5 was absent in CMLs. Using RISH significant HOXC4, HOXC5 and HOXC6 expression was found in a number of additionally studied AML samples of different FAB classification (M2, M4, M5b and M5b), (M2 and M5b) (M2, M4, M5b), respectively. In tissue localizations of leukemias a different expression pattern of HOXC4, HOXC5 and HOXC6 was found. In contrast to mature leukemic stages of myeloid differentiation, these skin localizations of leukemias expressed HOXC5 and HOXC6. HOXC4 expression was found both in leukemic cells derived from peripheral blood and from cutaneous localizations. Besides HOXC4 expression in monocytes no expression of HOXC4, HOXC5 and HOXC6 was found in granulocytes and monocytes, colonies of growth factor-induced CD34+ bone marrow cells. In earliest CD34+/CD38low and high cell fractions of bone marrow only HOXC4 and in megakaryocytic cells both HOXC4 and HOXC6 were found. Thus, the expression patterns of these HOXC genes found in the limited number of cell fractions of normal bone marrow suggest that the expression patterns found in AMLs and CMLs might reflect the normal situation. Furthermore, the presence of HOXC5 and HOXC6 expression specifically in skin infiltrates of late differentiation stages of myeloid leukemias, suggests an additional role for these genes in the positioning of these myeloid cells in skin tissue.","['Bijl, J J', 'van Oostveen, J W', 'Walboomers, J M', 'Brink, A T', 'Vos, W', 'Ossenkoppele, G J', 'Meijer, C J']","['Bijl JJ', 'van Oostveen JW', 'Walboomers JM', 'Brink AT', 'Vos W', 'Ossenkoppele GJ', 'Meijer CJ']","['Department of Pathology, Academic Hospital of the Vrije Universiteit, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Base Sequence', 'Bone Marrow Cells/immunology/*metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation', 'DNA Primers', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Homeodomain Proteins/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*genetics/immunology/*pathology', 'Leukemic Infiltration']",1998/11/21 00:00,1998/11/21 00:01,['1998/11/21 00:00'],"['1998/11/21 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/11/21 00:01 [medline]', '1998/11/21 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2401106 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 1998 Nov;12(11):1724-32. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2401106.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A 300/200 kb BCR/ABL probe was used in all tests and a smaller 35.5/39 kb probe was tested in parallel in 22 BM samples; (2) 30 BM samples were prepared by direct harvest and by 24-h culture and were analyzed in parallel; (3) PB and BM samples obtained simultaneously from 11 patients were analyzed. The cut-off point for the recognition of BCR/ABL fusion was set at 2.4%, calculated as the mean percent of false positivity in 11 controls plus 3 s.d. A very close correlation was observed (r=0.994, r2=0.988, P < 0.0001) between the percentages of Ph+ cells as assessed by CCA and by interphase FISH in 98 samples (26 at diagnosis). There was a moderate overestimation of the frequency of Ph+ cells by FISH with respect to CCA, that was more evident at low-to-medium values of Ph positivity. Seven specimens without Ph+ metaphases (17-50 cells analyzed) were shown to carry 2.5-8% interphase cells with BCR/ABL fusion. Similar percentages of BCR/ABL+ nuclei were recorded in 22 samples hybridized using the 300/200 kb and the 35.5/39 kb probe-sets (variation range: 0-5%, mean 2.3%). A very good correlation between the frequency of Ph+ interphase cells was observed when analyzing in parallel BM preparations after direct harvest and after 24-h culture. Underestimation of the percentage of BCR/ABL+ cells was noted to occur in 2/11 PB samples, compared to BM samples, the remaining nine cases showing superimposable results at either sites. We arrived at the following conclusions: (1) dual-color FISH enables an accurate detection and monitoring of the size of the Ph-positive clone in CML at diagnosis and after IFN-therapy; (2) FISH is more accurate than CCA, especially at low levels of Ph-positive cells; (3) testing of directly harvested BM samples is feasible and accurate, giving the opportunity to perform centralized FISH analysis in the context of multicentre trials; (4) the percentage of BCR/ABL+ PB cells usually, though not invariably, reflects the frequency of mutated cells in the BM.","['Cuneo, A', 'Bigoni, R', 'Emmanuel, B', 'Smit, E', 'Rigolin, G M', 'Roberti, M G', 'Bardi, A', 'Piva, N', 'Scapoli, G', 'Castoldi, G', 'Van Den Berghe, H', 'Hagemeijer, A']","['Cuneo A', 'Bigoni R', 'Emmanuel B', 'Smit E', 'Rigolin GM', 'Roberti MG', 'Bardi A', 'Piva N', 'Scapoli G', 'Castoldi G', 'Van Den Berghe H', 'Hagemeijer A']","['Department of Biomedical Sciences, University of Ferrara, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,['9008-11-1 (Interferons)'],IM,"['Adult', '*Clone Cells', 'Female', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Interferons/therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/genetics/*pathology/therapy', 'Male', 'Metaphase']",1998/11/21 00:00,1998/11/21 00:01,['1998/11/21 00:00'],"['1998/11/21 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/11/21 00:01 [medline]', '1998/11/21 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2401163 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 1998 Nov;12(11):1718-23. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2401163.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Previous studies suggest that abnormal integrin function in CML progenitors is related to the presence of the BCR/ABL oncogene. BCR/ABL may alter integrin function in CML by phosphorylating cytoskeletal and/or signaling proteins important for normal integrin function. We evaluated the effect of Tyrphostin AG957, a protein tyrosine kinase (PTK) inhibitor which has activity against the p210BCR/ABL kinase, on beta1 integrin function in CML progenitors. Incubation of CML marrow CD34+HLA-DR+ cells with Tyrphostin AG957 at concentrations that did not affect colony-forming cells (CFC) viability, but which partly inhibited p210BCR/ABL kinase activity, significantly increased CML CFC adhesion to stroma and alpha4beta1 and alpha5beta1 integrin binding fragments of fibronectin (FN). CML CFC proliferation, unlike that of normal CFC, is not inhibited following integrin receptor engagement with FN or anti-integrin antibodies. AG957 did not alter CML CFC proliferation by itself, but resulted in significant inhibition of CML CFC proliferation following integrin engagement. Another PTK inhibitor, Tyrphostin AG555, which does not have anti-p210BCR/ABL kinase activity, did not affect CML CFC adhesion or proliferation. Neither AG957 nor AG555 affected normal CFC adhesion or proliferation. In BCR/ABL expressing cells, AG957 partially inhibited phosphorylation of several proteins that are BCR/ABL PTK substrates and are involved in normal integrin signaling. These studies suggest that abnormal tyrosine phosphorylation may play an important role in defective integrin function in CML progenitors.","['Bhatia, R', 'Munthe, H A', 'Verfaillie, C M']","['Bhatia R', 'Munthe HA', 'Verfaillie CM']","['p6partment of Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation, City of Hope National Medical Center, Duarte, CA 91006, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Fibronectins)', '0 (Integrin beta1)', '0 (Tyrphostins)', '0 (tyrphostin AG957)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Cell Adhesion/drug effects/physiology', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Fibronectins/metabolism', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*drug effects/pathology', 'Humans', 'Integrin beta1/*physiology', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*pathology', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects/physiology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tyrphostins/*pharmacology']",1998/11/21 00:00,1998/11/21 00:01,['1998/11/21 00:00'],"['1998/11/21 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/11/21 00:01 [medline]', '1998/11/21 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2401193 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 1998 Nov;12(11):1708-17. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2401193.,"['P01 CA45814/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA65493/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R29 CA74455/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We investigated the proliferative characteristics of CD34+ cells of 33 untreated MDS patients (19 RA, 5 RARS, 7 RAEB, 2 RAEBt) and five patients with acute myeloid leukemia after MDS (sAML). All patients received a 1-h infusion of the thymidine analogue iodoor bromodeoxyuridine intravenously before a BM aspirate and biopsy was taken. A double-labeling immunohistochemistry technique by monoclonal anti-CD34 (QBend/10) and anti-IUdR/BrdU antibodies was developed and performed. By this technique we recognised CD34+ and CD34- cells actively engaged in DNA synthesis or not. As MDS evolves a significant increase occurred in the percentage of CD34+ cells of all myeloid cells (mean value: RA/RARS 1.67%; RAEB(t) 8.68%; sAML 23.83%) as well as in the percentage of proliferating CD34+ cells of all myeloid cells (RA/RARS 0.19%; RAEB(t) 0.43%; and sAML 3.30%). This was associated with a decreasing trend in the overall myeloid labeling index (LI: RA/RARS 25.8%, RAEB(t) 24.6% and sAML 21.5%). This decrease in overall myeloid LI is due to an exponential increase in the proportion of CD34+ cells of the proliferating compartment during MDS evolution (RA/RARS 0.35%, RAEB(t) 1.44% and sAML 11.98% of all S-phase cells). These CD34+ cells appeared to proliferate more slowly than their more mature CD34 negative counterparts, since we found a progressive increment in the mean total cell cycling time (Tc) of all myeloid cells during MDS progression (RA/RARS 39.8, RAEB(t) 45.2 and sAML 65.8 h).

In the first study, 150 18-month-old female F344 rats were divided into three groups of 50 rats per group: Group 1, solvent vehicle; Group 2, 10 microg GH/kg body weight three times per week; Group 3, 50 microg GH/kg body weight three times per week. GH and solvent vehicle therapies were started at 18 months of age and continued until all the animals died spontaneously. Serum insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-I was measured at 18 and 29 months of age and on 3-month-old rats. Serum IGF-I level decreased between 3 and 29 months of age. GH therapy reversed the decrease in a dose-dependent manner, with the 50 microg GH dose returning the serum IGF-I level to that of 3-month-old animals. However, statistical analysis revealed no significant effect of GH therapy on median life span, 10th percentile life span, or maximum life span. Similar observations on longevity were made on aged F344 male rats and on aged Balb/c mice, even when the dose of GH was increased to 1.0 mg/kg body weight two times per week. The main pathologic lesions in control animals were nephropathy, cardiomyopathy, leukemia, and testicular interstitial cell tumor; the prevalence of these lesions was not significantly altered by GH therapy. We conclude that long-term low-dose GH therapy that includes doses in the range that is given to humans in clinical trials in GH deficiency and to revert age-related physiologic declines has no overt deleterious effects on longevity and pathology in aged rodents.","['Kalu, D N', 'Orhii, P B', 'Chen, C', 'Lee, D Y', 'Hubbard, G B', 'Lee, S', 'Olatunji-Bello, Y']","['Kalu DN', 'Orhii PB', 'Chen C', 'Lee DY', 'Hubbard GB', 'Lee S', 'Olatunji-Bello Y']","['Department of Physiology, The University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio, 78284-7756, USA. kalu@uthscsa.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Gerontol A Biol Sci Med Sci,"The journals of gerontology.

In 46% of the ALL cases and 55% of the AML cases, FHIT expression was absent or markedly decreased. Only abnormal short bands were detected in 30% of the ALL cases and 5% of the AML cases. Eighteen of 19 abnormal transcripts had the same fusion of exons 2-7, and all lacked the starting codon in exon 5. No obvious normal-sized PCR products were detected in cases exhibiting abnormal transcripts. These findings suggest that the expression of functional FHIT protein was lost in the majority of ALL (76%) and AML (60%) cases. Differential quantitative PCR of exons 3-9 of the FHIT gene and RT-PCR of the PTPRG gene, which is centromeric to the FHIT gene, showed the presence of the target sequences. Fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis using probes covering exons 5 and 8 revealed no difference in the signal patterns between leukemia and normal cells, showing one or two signal doublets in more than 90% of nuclei, and indicated that gross segments of the FHIT gene were not homozygously deleted in these cases. A small number of transcripts with an aberrant fusion between exons 2 and 7 were detected by RT-PCR in the bone marrow cells from four healthy individuals. Granulocytes, lymphocytes, and monocytes in the bone marrow cells of a healthy individual contained transcripts with the same fusion. This unique fusion of exons 2 and 7 might be preferentially seen in either neoplastic or normal hematopoietic cells, regardless of their lineage. The finding that FHIT expression was abolished in the majority of leukemia cases might support the hypothesis that the FHIT gene acts as a tumor suppressor, at least in leukemia.","['Iwai, T', 'Yokota, S', 'Nakao, M', 'Nakazawa, N', 'Taniwaki, M', 'Kimura, T', 'Sonoda, Y', 'Kaneko, H', 'Okuda, T', 'Azuma, H', 'Oka, T', 'Takeda, T', 'Watanabe, A', 'Kikuta, A', 'Asami, K', 'Sekine, I', 'Matsushita, T', 'Tsuchiya, T', 'Mimaya, J', 'Koizumi, S', 'Ohta, S', 'Miyake, M', 'Takaue, Y', 'Iwai, A', 'Fujimoto, T']","['Iwai T', 'Yokota S', 'Nakao M', 'Nakazawa N', 'Taniwaki M', 'Kimura T', 'Sonoda Y', 'Kaneko H', 'Okuda T', 'Azuma H', 'Oka T', 'Takeda T', 'Watanabe A', 'Kikuta A', 'Asami K', 'Sekine I', 'Matsushita T', 'Tsuchiya T', 'Mimaya J', 'Koizumi S', 'Ohta S', 'Miyake M', 'Takaue Y', 'Iwai A', 'Fujimoto T']","['Third Department of Internal Medicine, Kyoto Prefectural University of Medicine, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (fragile histidine triad protein)', 'EC 3.6.- (Acid Anhydride Hydrolases)']",IM,"['*Acid Anhydride Hydrolases', 'Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Bone Marrow/metabolism', 'Child', 'Gene Deletion', 'Gene Expression', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/genetics', 'Leukemia, Monocytic, Acute/genetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Acute/genetics', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/genetics', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics', 'Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism']",1998/11/21 00:00,1998/11/21 00:01,['1998/11/21 00:00'],"['1998/11/21 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/11/21 00:01 [medline]', '1998/11/21 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1998 Nov 15;58(22):5182-7.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The cycle is endowed with kinases as well as phosphatases and phospholipase C (PLC). Among the PLC isozymes, the beta family is characterized by a long COOH-terminal tail that contains a cluster of lysine residues responsible for nuclear localization. Indeed, PLC beta 1 is the major isoform that has been detected in the nucleus of several cells. This isoform is activated by insulin-like growth factor I, and when this isoform is lacking, as a result of gene ablation, the onset of DNA synthesis induced by this hormone is abolished. On the contrary, PLC beta 1 is down-regulated during the erythroid differentiation of Friend erythroleukemia cells. A key question is how PLC beta 1 signaling at the nucleus fits into the erythroid differentiation program of Friend erythroleukemia cells, and whether PLC beta 1 signaling activity is directly responsible for the maintenance of the undifferentiated state of erythroleukemia cells. Here we present evidence that nuclear PLC beta 1 but not the isoform located at the plasma membrane is directly involved in maintaining the undifferentiated state of Friend erythroleukemia cells. Indeed, when wild-type PLC beta 1 is overexpressed in these cells, differentiation in response to DMSO is inhibited in that the expression of beta-globin is almost completely abolished, whereas when a mutant lacking the ability to localize to the nucleus is expressed, the cells differentiate, and the expression of beta-globin is the same as in wild-type cells.","['Matteucci, A', 'Faenza, I', 'Gilmour, R S', 'Manzoli, L', 'Billi, A M', 'Peruzzi, D', 'Bavelloni, A', 'Rhee, S G', 'Cocco, L']","['Matteucci A', 'Faenza I', 'Gilmour RS', 'Manzoli L', 'Billi AM', 'Peruzzi D', 'Bavelloni A', 'Rhee SG', 'Cocco L']","['Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche and Cell Biology Laboratory, Istituto Rizzoli, Bologna, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Isoenzymes)', '0 (Solvents)', '9004-22-2 (Globins)', 'EC 3.1.4.- (Type C Phospholipases)', 'EC 3.1.4.11 (Phospholipase C beta)', 'EC 3.1.4.11 (Plcb1 protein, mouse)', 'YOW8V9698H (Dimethyl Sulfoxide)']",IM,"['Animals', '*Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Nucleus/*enzymology', 'Cytoplasm/enzymology', 'Dimethyl Sulfoxide/pharmacology', '*Friend murine leukemia virus', 'Globins/metabolism', 'Isoenzymes/genetics/*physiology', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/enzymology/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Phospholipase C beta', 'Solvents/pharmacology', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Type C Phospholipases/genetics/*physiology']",1998/11/21 00:00,1998/11/21 00:01,['1998/11/21 00:00'],"['1998/11/21 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/11/21 00:01 [medline]', '1998/11/21 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1998 Nov 15;58(22):5057-60.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Using the method of multidimensional scaling to represent the relationships among the cell lines in two-dimensional Euclidean space, we determined that ARMS cells show a consistent pattern of gene expression, which allows the cells to be clustered together. By searching across the seven ARMS cell lines, we found that 37 of 1238 genes were most consistently expressed in ARMS relative to a reference cell line.

In this study we have examined the mechanisms regulating the generation of differentiated oligodendrocytes (OLs) from these multipotent cells. Although cultures of primary cortical OL progenitor cells propagated at clonal density spontaneously gave rise to differentiated OLs in defined medium, cultures of multipotent progenitors isolated from identical regions supported the elaboration of OL progenitors but not differentiated OLs. These observations indicate that the terminal maturation of OL progenitors derived from multipotent cells is dependent on signals present within the cellular environment. Application of cytokines such as basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), or neurotrophin 3 (NT3) to clonal density cultures of cortical multipotent progenitors increased the proportion of OL progenitors but failed to support the generation of differentiated OLs. By contrast, application of factors that activate gp130/leukemia inhibitory factor beta (LIFbeta) heterodimeric receptors, such as ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF), activated signal transducers and activators of transcription-3 in these OL progenitor cells and promoted the generation of differentiated OLs. Clonal analysis also demonstrated that CNTF directly targets OL progenitors derived from the multipotent cells. These observations suggest that two distinct progenitor cell pathways contribute to the generation of differentiated OLs during postnatal cortical gliogenesis. Although oligodendroglial maturation of classical OL progenitor cells is driven by cell autonomous mechanisms, our findings demonstrate that the generation of differentiated OLs from cortical multipotent progenitor cells is dependent on environmental cues, including activation of gp130/LIFbeta receptors.","['Marmur, R', 'Kessler, J A', 'Zhu, G', 'Gokhan, S', 'Mehler, M F']","['Marmur R', 'Kessler JA', 'Zhu G', 'Gokhan S', 'Mehler MF']","['Department of Neuroscience, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, New York 10461, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Neurosci,The Journal of neuroscience : the official journal of the Society for Neuroscience,8102140,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Ciliary Neurotrophic Factor)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Il6st protein, rat)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Nerve Growth Factors)', '0 (Nerve Tissue Proteins)', '0 (Neurotrophin 3)', '0 (Platelet-Derived Growth Factor)', '103107-01-3 (Fibroblast Growth Factor 2)', '133483-10-0 (Cytokine Receptor gp130)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, CD/*physiology', 'Cell Differentiation/physiology', 'Cell Division/physiology', 'Cell Nucleus/chemistry/physiology', 'Ciliary Neurotrophic Factor', 'Cytokine Receptor gp130', 'Dimerization', 'Fibroblast Growth Factor 2/metabolism', 'Growth Inhibitors/*physiology', '*Interleukin-6', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Lymphokines/*physiology', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/*physiology', 'Nerve Growth Factors/metabolism', 'Nerve Tissue Proteins/metabolism', 'Neurotrophin 3', 'Oligodendroglia/*cytology', 'Phosphorylation', 'Platelet-Derived Growth Factor/physiology', 'Prosencephalon/cytology', 'Rats', 'Rats, Sprague-Dawley', 'Signal Transduction/*physiology', 'Stem Cells/*cytology']",1998/11/21 00:00,1998/11/21 00:01,['1998/11/21 00:00'],"['1998/11/21 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/11/21 00:01 [medline]', '1998/11/21 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Neurosci. 1998 Dec 1;18(23):9800-11.,['R01 MH066290/MH/NIMH NIH HHS/United States'],,PMC6793299,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Adenophostin A, a potent activator of the inositol 1, 4,5-trisphosphate receptor, has been reported to activate Ca2+ entry in Xenopus oocytes to a greater extent than expected on the basis of its ability to release calcium stores. In this study, we compared the abilities of adenophostin A and inositol 2,4,5-trisphosphate ((2, 4,5)IP3) to release Ca2+ from intracellular stores, to activate Ca2+ entry, and to activate calcium release-activated calcium current (Icrac) in rat basophilic leukemia cells. Under conditions of low intracellular Ca2+ buffering (0.1 mM BAPTA), adenophostin A-induced Ca2+ release and activation of Icrac could be monitored simultaneously. However, other reagents that would be expected to deplete Ca2+ stores ((2,4,5)IP3, 3-fluoro-inositol 1,4, 5-trisphosphate, thapsigargin, and ionomycin) were unable to activate Icrac under this low Ca2+ buffering condition. Adenophostin A activated Icrac after a significant delay, longer than the delay for Ca2+ release. Thus, adenophostin A activates Icrac as a consequence of release of intracellular Ca2+, rather than directly acting on store-operated channels. The unique ability of adenophostin A to activate Icrac under conditions of low intracellular Ca2+ buffering suggests an additional site of action, perhaps in preventing or reducing rapid Ca2+-dependent inactivation of store-operated Ca2+ channels.","['Huang, Y', 'Takahashi, M', 'Tanzawa, K', 'Putney, J W Jr']","['Huang Y', 'Takahashi M', 'Tanzawa K', 'Putney JW Jr']","['Calcium Regulation Section, Laboratory of Signal Transduction, NIEHS, National Institutes of Health, Research Triangle Park, North Carolina 27709, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Calcium Channels)', '0 (Inositol Phosphates)', '149091-92-9 (adenophostin A)', '24GP945V5T (Barium)', '526U7A2651 (Egtazic Acid)', '85166-31-0 (Inositol 1,4,5-Trisphosphate)', '91840-07-2 (inositol 2,4,5-trisphosphate)', ""K22DDW77C0 (1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid)"", 'K72T3FS567 (Adenosine)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Adenosine/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Barium/metabolism', 'Calcium/*metabolism', 'Calcium Channels/drug effects/*physiology', 'Egtazic Acid/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Inositol 1,4,5-Trisphosphate/metabolism', 'Inositol Phosphates/metabolism', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Basophilic, Acute', 'Rats', 'Time Factors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1998/11/21 03:02,2001/03/28 10:01,['1998/11/21 03:02'],"['1998/11/21 03:02 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1998/11/21 03:02 [entrez]']","['10.1074/jbc.273.48.31815 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(19)59019-6 [pii]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1998 Nov 27;273(48):31815-21. doi: 10.1074/jbc.273.48.31815.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The imidazole and thioimidazole analogues were prepared by initial synthesis of [(4-aminophenyl)alkyl]imidazole-, thioimidazole-, or pyrrolizine dicarboxylates, coupling of these with the desired carrier, and reduction to give the required bis(hydroxymethyl) alkylating moiety. The pyrrolizines were the most reactive alkylators, followed by the thioimidazoles, while the imidazoles were unreactive. The pyrrolizines and some of the thioimidazoles cross-linked DNA, as measured by agarose gel electrophoresis. Strand cleavage assays showed that none of the compounds reacted at purine N7 or N3 sites in the gpt region of the plasmid gpt2Eco, but the polymerase stop assay showed patterns of G-alkylation in C-rich regions. The corresponding thioimidazole bis(carbamates) were more selective than the bis(hydroxymethyl) pyrrolizines, with high-intensity bands at 5'-NCCN, 5'-NGCN and 5'-NCGN sequences in the PCR stopping assay ( indicates block sites). The data suggest that these targeted compounds, like the known thioimidazole bis(carbamate) carmethizole, alkylate exclusively at guanine residues via the 2-amino group, with little or no alkylation at N3 and N7 guanine or adenine sites. The cytotoxicities of the compounds correlated broadly with their reactivities, with the bis(hydroxymethyl)imidazoles being the least cytotoxic (IC50s >1 microM; P388 leukemia) and with the intercalator-linked analogues being more cytotoxic than the corresponding minor-groove-targeted ones. This was true also for the more reactive thioimidazole bis(carbamates) (IC50s 0.8 and 11 microM, respectively), but both were more active than the analogous ""untargeted"" carmethizole (IC50 20 microM). The bis(hydroxymethyl)pyrrolizine analogues were the most cytotoxic, with IC50s as low as 0.03 microM.","['Atwell, G J', 'Fan, J Y', 'Tan, K', 'Denny, W A']","['Atwell GJ', 'Fan JY', 'Tan K', 'Denny WA']","['Auckland Cancer Society Research Centre, Faculty of Medicine and Health Science, The University of Auckland, Private Bag 92019, Auckland, New Zealand.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Med Chem,Journal of medicinal chemistry,9716531,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating)', '0 (Carbamates)', '0 (Cross-Linking Reagents)', '0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (DNA, Superhelical)', '0 (Imidazoles)', '0 (Pyrroles)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",IM,"['Alkylation', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating/*chemical synthesis/chemistry/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Base Sequence', 'Carbamates/*chemical synthesis/chemistry/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Cross-Linking Reagents/chemical synthesis/chemistry/metabolism/pharmacology', 'DNA/chemistry/*metabolism', 'DNA Primers', 'DNA, Superhelical/chemistry/metabolism', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Electrophoresis, Agar Gel', 'Imidazoles/*chemical synthesis/chemistry/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia P388/pathology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Pyrroles/*chemical synthesis/chemistry/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1998/11/21 00:00,1998/11/21 00:01,['1998/11/21 00:00'],"['1998/11/21 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/11/21 00:01 [medline]', '1998/11/21 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1021/jm9803119 [doi]', 'jm9803119 [pii]']",ppublish,J Med Chem. 1998 Nov 19;41(24):4744-54. doi: 10.1021/jm9803119.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

STUDY DESIGN: Amniocentesis was performed on 41 pregnant women with preterm contractions, labor, or premature rupture of membranes. Intra-amniotic infection was defined as the presence of a positive amniotic fluid culture result. Amniotic fluid tests for Gram stain, glucose, leukocyte counts, creatinine level, pH, and specific gravity were performed. Amniotic fluid levels of leukemia inhibitory factor, interleukin 6, and interleukin 8 were measured by an enzyme-linked immunoassay. Unlike in previous reports, cytokines were normalized by amniotic fluid creatinine levels. RESULTS: Fifteen patients had intra-amniotic infection and 26 did not. Amniotic fluid median levels of leukemia inhibitory factor, interleukin 6, and interleukin 8 were significantly higher in pregnant women with intra-amniotic infection than in those without intra-amniotic infection (leukemia inhibitory factor median 3912 pg/mg creatinine, range 0.0-199314, vs 56 pg/mg creatinine, range 0. 0-12148, P =.01; interleukin 6 median 2005 ng/mg creatinine, range 27-4071, vs 990 ng/mg creatinine, range 7.5-3409, P =.005; interleukin 8: median 4933 ng/mg creatinine, range 0.0-55058, vs 61 ng/mg creatinine, range 0.0-2399, P =.005). Amniotic fluid levels of leukemia inhibitory factor, interleukin 6, and interleukin 8 were positively correlated. CONCLUSIONS: The data indicate that leukemia inhibitory factor plays an important role in the pathogenesis of intra-amniotic infection. In addition, significant elevations of and correlations among amniotic fluid levels of leukemia inhibitory factor, interleukin 6, and interleukin 8 suggest that measurements of these cytokines in amniotic fluid may be of diagnostic and prognostic importance.","['Hsu, C D', 'Meaddough, E', 'Aversa, K', 'Hong, S F', 'Lu, L C', 'Jones, D C', 'Copel, J A']","['Hsu CD', 'Meaddough E', 'Aversa K', 'Hong SF', 'Lu LC', 'Jones DC', 'Copel JA']","['Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, Connecticut, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Am J Obstet Gynecol,American journal of obstetrics and gynecology,0370476,"['0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Interleukin-8)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lymphokines)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Amniotic Fluid/*chemistry/*microbiology', 'Female', 'Growth Inhibitors/*analysis', 'Humans', 'Infections/*metabolism', 'Interleukin-6/*analysis', 'Interleukin-8/*analysis', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Lymphokines/*analysis', 'Osmolar Concentration', 'Pregnancy', 'Reference Values']",1998/11/20 00:00,1998/11/20 00:01,['1998/11/20 00:00'],"['1998/11/20 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/11/20 00:01 [medline]', '1998/11/20 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0002937898701449 [pii]', '10.1016/s0002-9378(98)70144-9 [doi]']",ppublish,Am J Obstet Gynecol. 1998 Nov;179(5):1267-70. doi: 10.1016/s0002-9378(98)70144-9.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We first performed experimental models of MRD and chimerism by mixing HL60 cells and normal lymphocytes in different proportions. Over 80% HL60 cells were obtained from mixtures of 5% HL60 cells in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). We then evaluated MRD and mixed chimerism in a chronic myelogenous leukemia patient in relapse after allogeneic sex-mismatched bone marrow transplantation (BMT), who had received a donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI). Three months after DLI, mixed chimerism was observed in each bone marrow (BM)-sorted lineage (CD13+, CD14+, CD20+, and CD3+), with the highest level of recipient cells in the granulocytic lineage (CD13+). Five months after DLI, host cells were at a low level but remained detectable in the granulocytic lineage. In the same sample, the bcr-abl gene was detected in the granulocytic lineage and not in the lymphocytes. We also studied chimerism in an aplastic anemia sex-mismatched transplanted female patient. We determined the proportion of recipient total lymphocytes, CD4+ and CD8+ lymphocytes, and CD14+ monocytes under cyclosporin A therapy on five peripheral blood samples and one BM sample over 5 months. Results showed a regular decrease in recipient total lymphocytes (26.6% to 10.6%) and monocytes (20.7% to 8%). CD8(+)-recipient cells decreased rapidly, while CD4+ remained stable (17%).

Protein-bound carbohydrates were calculated by subtraction of ceramide-bound carbohydrates from total carbohydrates. In all samples analysed the contents of total and protein-bound carbohydrates were much lower in leukemic leukocytes than in normal neutrophils, irrespective whether the results were expressed relative to protein, DNA, cell number or dry mass. For immature leukemic cells of M0-M1 phenotype differences up to 10-fold were observed. Contents of ceramide-bound carbohydrates, i.e. those of neutral and acidic glycosphingolipids (GSLs) were also low in leukemic cells.

The results are discussed in the light of the hypothesis on GSL function by one of us (Koscielak J., 1986, Glycoconjugate J. 3, 95-108). According to one element of the hypothesis, during cell differentiation newly synthesized glycoproteins (GPs) that perform specific functions are added to house-keeping GPs that are present in plasma membranes of all types of cells.

These findings strongly suggest that CF is not a metabolite of DHP-pCA but an endogenous component of the normal serum which is augmented by DHP-pCA administration.","['Kohara, A', 'Shimizu, N', 'Kawazoe, Y']","['Kohara A', 'Shimizu N', 'Kawazoe Y']","['Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Nagoya City University, Tanabedori, Nagoya, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Japan,Biol Pharm Bull,Biological & pharmaceutical bulletin,9311984,"['0 (Coumaric Acids)', '0 (Cytotoxins)', '3K9958V90M (Ethanol)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Chromatography', 'Coumaric Acids/*pharmacology', 'Cytotoxins/*biosynthesis/blood', 'Drug Stability', 'Ethanol/chemistry', 'Hydrogen-Ion Concentration', 'Leukemia L1210/drug therapy', 'Mice']",1998/11/20 00:00,1998/11/20 00:01,['1998/11/20 00:00'],"['1998/11/20 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/11/20 00:01 [medline]', '1998/11/20 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1248/bpb.21.1098 [doi]'],ppublish,Biol Pharm Bull. 1998 Oct;21(10):1098-101. doi: 10.1248/bpb.21.1098.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

STUDY DESIGN: Eligible case patients for this analysis included individuals with a diagnosis of leukemia confirmed at a Children's Cancer Group member institution: 2117 diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and 605 diagnosed with acute myelogenous leukemia (AML). Case patients were compared with matched regional population control subjects selected by using a modified random digit dialing method. Data regarding congenital abnormalities in index children and their siblings were collected by telephone interview with the biologic mother. Relative risk was estimated by using the odds ratio (OR). RESULTS: More congenital abnormalities were reported in index case patients with ALL than in control subjects, with statistically significant increases in multiple birthmarks (OR = 1.35), Down syndrome (OR = 4.85), congenital heart defects (OR = 1.48), and pancreas-digestive tract abnormalities (OR = 2.52). Similarly, birth defects were reported more often among index case patients with AML than control subjects (OR = 2.90), with significant increases in multiple birthmarks (OR = 1.89), Down syndrome (OR = 76.80), mental retardation (OR = 14.47), and congenital heart defects (OR = 2.07). Exclusion of case patients with Down syndrome from the analysis did not change the statistically significant excess of pancreas-digestive tract abnormalities in case patients with ALL or the excess of multiple birthmarks observed in both case patients with ALL and those with AML. For both the ALL and AML analyses, no significant differences in the number of reported congenital abnormalities were seen between siblings of case patients and siblings of control subjects. CONCLUSION: Many of the observed associations with congenital abnormalities occurred in the children with Down syndrome, who are known to have an increased risk for leukemia. The higher reported frequency of birthmarks among case patients may suggest a genetic component to leukemia risk.","['Mertens, A C', 'Wen, W', 'Davies, S M', 'Steinbuch, M', 'Buckley, J D', 'Potter, J D', 'Robison, L L']","['Mertens AC', 'Wen W', 'Davies SM', 'Steinbuch M', 'Buckley JD', 'Potter JD', 'Robison LL']","['Department of Pediatrics, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Pediatr,The Journal of pediatrics,0375410,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Congenital Abnormalities/diagnosis/*genetics', 'Down Syndrome/diagnosis/genetics', 'Female', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease/genetics', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/diagnosis/*genetics', 'Male', 'Odds Ratio', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/diagnosis/*genetics', 'Risk']",1998/11/20 06:39,2000/02/19 09:00,['1998/11/20 06:39'],"['1998/11/20 06:39 [pubmed]', '2000/02/19 09:00 [medline]', '1998/11/20 06:39 [entrez]']","['S0022-3476(98)70100-3 [pii]', '10.1016/s0022-3476(98)70100-3 [doi]']",ppublish,J Pediatr. 1998 Nov;133(5):617-23. doi: 10.1016/s0022-3476(98)70100-3.,"['CA 02971/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 13539/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 17829/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",['J Pediatr. 1999 Nov;135(5):653.

EORTC Invasive Fungal Infections Cooperative Group.,173-80,"OBJECTIVES: The EORTC Invasive Fungal Infections Cooperative Group (IFICG) conducted a prospective survey by questionnaire of all cases of invasive aspergillosis (IA) in cancer patients to ascertain current diagnostic and therapeutic approaches. METHODS: All members of the IFICG were asked prospectively to complete a detailed questionnaire for each IA case identified in their institution over a 12-month period. RESULTS: One hundred and thirty questionnaires were returned. All cases were independently evaluated (DWD & JC) and 123 were eligible. Cases came from 20 hospitals in eight countries and the number of cases per institution varied from 1-21. Acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) (60, 49%), acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) (21, 17%) and lymphoma (11, 9%) were the most frequent underlying diseases, and 16 (12%) patients had received an allogeneic bone marrow transplant. Pulmonary involvement was present in 87%, infection of sinuses/nose in 16% and brain in 8%. The chest radiograph was initially normal in 9% of those with primary pulmonary disease. The diagnosis was confirmed in 50%, probable in 31% and possible in 19%. The evidence for IA was on the basis of clinical and radiological features alone in 28%, with culture or histology in another 31% and 9%, respectively, and with both culture and histology in 29%. In three (2%) patients with diagnosis was based on culture or histology alone. Treatment was given to 120 patients (98%)-amphotericin B 75%, lipid-associated amphotericin B 36%, itraconazole 40%, flucytosine 12%, growth factors 33%, lobectomy 5%. At 3 months after diagnosis or first suspicion of IA, 44 (36%) patients were alive and 79 (64%) dead. Outcome was best in those with AML (30% death and 46% with a complete antifungal response or cure). Growth factors (mostly granulocyte colony stimulating factor) appeared not to influence outcome (P = 0.99). CONCLUSION: IA remains a considerable diagnostic and therapeutic challenge. No single diagnostic procedure was universally successful and a multifaceted approach including surgery is necessary. There was no discernable difference in outcome between initial therapy with amphotericin B, itraconazole or lipid-associated amphotericin B, although numbers are limited and the study was retrospective.","['Denning, D W', 'Marinus, A', 'Cohen, J', 'Spence, D', 'Herbrecht, R', 'Pagano, L', 'Kibbler, C', 'Kcrmery, V', 'Offner, F', 'Cordonnier, C', 'Jehn, U', 'Ellis, M', 'Collette, L', 'Sylvester, R']","['Denning DW', 'Marinus A', 'Cohen J', 'Spence D', 'Herbrecht R', 'Pagano L', 'Kibbler C', 'Kcrmery V', 'Offner F', 'Cordonnier C', 'Jehn U', 'Ellis M', 'Collette L', 'Sylvester R']","['Department of Medicine, University of Manchester, Hope Hospital, Salford, U.K.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",England,J Infect,The Journal of infection,7908424,"['0 (Antifungal Agents)', '304NUG5GF4 (Itraconazole)', '7XU7A7DROE (Amphotericin B)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Amphotericin B/therapeutic use', 'Antifungal Agents/therapeutic use', 'Aspergillosis/*complications/diagnosis/drug therapy', 'Child', 'Female', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*complications', 'Humans', 'Itraconazole/therapeutic use', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Opportunistic Infections/*complications/diagnosis/drug therapy/microbiology', 'Prospective Studies', 'Survival Analysis']",1998/11/24 00:00,1998/11/24 00:01,['1998/11/24 00:00'],"['1998/11/24 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/11/24 00:01 [medline]', '1998/11/24 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0163-4453(98)80173-4 [pii]', '10.1016/s0163-4453(98)80173-4 [doi]']",ppublish,J Infect. 1998 Sep;37(2):173-80. doi: 10.1016/s0163-4453(98)80173-4.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Extracellular 1-palmitoyl LPC increased the intracellular Ca2+ concentration in association with production of inositol phosphate. These actions of LPC were markedly inhibited by treatment of the cells with pertussis toxin and U73122, a phospholipase C inhibitor. The lipid-induced stimulation of the phospholipase C/Ca2+ system was also attenuated in the dibutyryl cAMP-induced differentiated (neutrophil-like) cells, in which phospholipase C activation induced by NaF or formyl-Met-Leu-Phe was enhanced. In contrast with the stimulatory action of 1-palmitoyl LPC, 1-stearoyl LPC was inhibitory for the phospholipase C/Ca2+ system stimulated by NaF as well as by 1-palmitoyl LPC or other Ca2+-mobilizing agonists. In a cell-free system, only an inhibitory effect on phospholipase C activity was observed even by 1-palmitoyl LPC; 1-stearoyl LPC was more inhibitive than 1-palmitoyl LPC. Taken together, these results suggest that atherogenic and inflammatory LPC exerts both stimulatory and inhibitory actions on the phospholipase C/Ca2+ system depending on the species of fatty acid residue of the lipid; the stimulatory effect is possibly mediated through G-protein-coupled receptors; the inhibitory effect might be caused by dysfunction of the components involved in the enzyme system owing to the amphiphilic nature of the lipid. 1-Palmitoyl LPC prefers the former receptor stimulation at least in intact cells, but 1-stearoyl LPC preferentially exerts the latter inhibitory action.","['Okajima, F', 'Sato, K', 'Tomura, H', 'Kuwabara, A', 'Nochi, H', 'Tamoto, K', 'Kondo, Y', 'Tokumitsu, Y', 'Ui, M']","['Okajima F', 'Sato K', 'Tomura H', 'Kuwabara A', 'Nochi H', 'Tamoto K', 'Kondo Y', 'Tokumitsu Y', 'Ui M']","['Laboratory of Signal Transduction, Institute for Molecular and Cellular Regulation, Gunma University, 3-39-15 Showa-machi, Maebashi 371-8512, Japan. fokajima@news.sb.gunma-u.ac.jp']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Biochem J,The Biochemical journal,2984726R,"['0 (Lysophosphatidylcholines)', '0 (Oleic Acids)', '0 (Palmitic Acids)', '0 (Stearic Acids)', '0 (Virulence Factors, Bordetella)', '14863-27-5 (We 201)', '63X7MBT2LQ (Bucladesine)', 'EC 2.4.2.31 (Pertussis Toxin)', 'EC 3.1.4.- (Type C Phospholipases)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Bucladesine/pharmacology', 'Calcium/*metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell-Free System', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'HL-60 Cells/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Lysophosphatidylcholines/*chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Oleic Acids/chemistry', 'Palmitic Acids/chemistry', 'Pertussis Toxin', 'Stearic Acids/chemistry', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Type C Phospholipases/antagonists & inhibitors/*drug effects', 'Virulence Factors, Bordetella/pharmacology']",1998/11/20 00:00,1998/11/20 00:01,['1998/11/20 00:00'],"['1998/11/20 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/11/20 00:01 [medline]', '1998/11/20 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1042/bj3360491 [doi]'],ppublish,Biochem J. 1998 Dec 1;336 ( Pt 2):491-500. doi: 10.1042/bj3360491.,,,PMC1219895,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Activation of normal B cells with soluble anti-CD40 monoclonal antibody (mAb) induced tyrosine phosphorylation, prolonged survival and prevented apoptosis. However, activation of CD40 on B-CLL cells using soluble anti-CD40 mAb does not influence survival or apoptosis. Normal B cells entered apoptosis when cultured in the presence of soluble anti-CD95 mAb. This process was independent of PTK activity. On B-CLL cells, the CD95 molecules were downregulated and a transient PTK signal was observed when cross-linking of the receptor by soluble anti-CD95 mAb occurred. Interestingly, B-CLL cells did not enter apoptosis in the presence of anti-CD95 mAb. Our study indicates that survival signals mediated through the CD40 molecule and death signals mediated through the CD95 molecule used different intracellular pathways in control donor B cells. In contrast, B-CLL cells do not respond to these signals. The leukemic B cells showed a defective CD40-mediated signal transduction and downregulated CD95 receptor expression. As a consequence, no apoptosis could be induced in B-CLL cells by a soluble anti-CD95 mAb. The abnormalities of these receptors may contribute to the long-lived status of B-CLL cells.","['Laytragoon-Lewin, N', 'Duhony, E', 'Bai, X F', 'Mellstedt, H']","['Laytragoon-Lewin N', 'Duhony E', 'Bai XF', 'Mellstedt H']","['Department of Experimental Oncology, Uppsala University, Stockholm, Sweden.

The permeability was found significantly increased (p<0.02) in the patients before induction chemotherapy treatment. During induction treatment and throughout the cytopenic period the intestinal permeability was constantly and significantly increased, compared with controls. In patients with abnormally increased permeability, no increase in hydrogen breath test result was noted.

However, some modulators do not interact with P-gp. We have demonstrated in a previous a work, using confocal laser microspectrofluorometry, that quinine does not increase nuclear anthracycline uptake in multidrug-resistant Chinese hamster ovary LR73 cells. In this case the LR73 cells were transfected with the mdr1 gene. Moreover, quinine induced in these cells an increase of mdr1 gene expression. In the present study, we investigated verapamil and quinine for their ability to increase nuclear pirarubicin uptake in multidrug-resistant K562R and CEMR human leukemic cell lines. These two cell lines resist, respectively, to doxorubicin and vinblastine and both overexpress the P-gp. Verapamil was able to restore nuclear pirarubicin in both cell lines. On the other hand, quinine was unable to significantly increase nuclear pirarubicin uptake. Both modulators were able to restore pirarubicin sensitivity in both resistant cell lines. After treatment with quinine, mdr1 gene and P-gp expression was not significantly altered as observed previously in the LR73 cells. This suggest that the effect of quinine on mdr1 gene expression is dependent on the cell line studied. These data suggest that quinine could modify the molecular environment of anthracyclines and/or its binding to a possible cytoplasmic target, and that the mechanisms by which anthracyclines induce cell death, and ways by which chemotherapy fails in multidrug-resistant leukemic cells remain complex and are related to more than one target.","['Morjani, H', 'Belhoussine, R', 'Lahlil, R', 'Manfait, M']","['Morjani H', 'Belhoussine R', 'Lahlil R', 'Manfait M']","['Laboratory of Biomolecular Spectroscopy, University of Reims Champagne-Ardenne, IFR53, UPRES EA2063, Faculty of Pharmacy, France.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Eur J Haematol,European journal of haematology,8703985,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', 'D58G680W0G (pirarubicin)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/*genetics', 'Animals', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'CHO Cells', 'Cell Death/drug effects', 'Cell Nucleus/metabolism', 'Cricetinae', 'Doxorubicin/*analogs & derivatives/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance, Multiple/*genetics', 'Gene Transfer Techniques', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia/drug therapy/*genetics/metabolism/pathology']",1998/11/20 00:00,1998/11/20 00:01,['1998/11/20 00:00'],"['1998/11/20 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/11/20 00:01 [medline]', '1998/11/20 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1600-0609.1998.tb01709.x [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Haematol. 1998 Oct;61(4):240-9. doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0609.1998.tb01709.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This cell line was established from a patient with CLL resistant to fludarabine. The results revealed a significant increase in dCK activity in bryostatin 1 treated cells at 48 and 72 h compared with the control. 5'-NT activity decreased significantly at 48 h. The ratio of dCK to 5'-NT activity was significantly increased in bryostatin 1 treated WSU-CLL cells after 48 h. WSU-CLL cells treated with bryostatin 1 exhibited an increase in the percentage of apoptotic and dead cells from control levels of 16% to 40%. This percentage was further increased to 67% following the addition of 11.2 microM 2-CdA to WSU-CLL cells pretreated with bryostatin 1. Results from Western blot analysis indicate that WSU-CLL cells express high levels of Bcl-2, Bcl-xL and c-myc, and a low level of Bax. p53 in untreated WSU-CLL cells is undetectable. WSU-CLL cells treated with bryostatin 1 showed a significant increase in the ratio of Bax to Bcl-2. To demonstrate that the bryostatin 1 mediated enhancement of 2-CdA efficacy was not restricted to in vitro cell culture, we have studied the tumor growth delay of WSU-CLL xenografts treated with placebo, bryostatin 1, 2-CdA, and bryostatin 1 followed by 2-CdA. SCID mice given bryostatin 1 at 75 microg x kg(-1) x d(-1) for 5 days followed by 30 mg x kg(-1) x d(-1) 2-CdA for 5 days in two cycles, had significantly improved tumor growth delay (P = 0.05). We conclude that bryostatin 1 is not only capable of inducing apoptosis by itself, but also sensitizes de novo resistant WSU-CLL cells to the chemo-therapeutic effects of 2-CdA. The bryostatin 1-induced increased ratio of dCK/5'-NT activity and an increased ratio of Bax/Bcl-2 are at least two mechanisms through which this natural compound is able to potentiate the anti-tumor activity of 2-CdA in otherwise resistant CLL cells.","['Mohammad, R M', 'Beck, F W', 'Katato, K', 'Hamdy, N', 'Wall, N', 'Al-Katib, A']","['Mohammad RM', 'Beck FW', 'Katato K', 'Hamdy N', 'Wall N', 'Al-Katib A']","['Department of Medicine, Karmanos Cancer Institute, Wayne State University School of Medicine, Detroit, MI 48201, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Biol Chem,Biological chemistry,9700112,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (BAX protein, human)', '0 (Bax protein, mouse)', '0 (Bryostatins)', '0 (Lactones)', '0 (Macrolides)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', '37O2X55Y9E (bryostatin 1)', '47M74X9YT5 (Cladribine)', 'EC 2.7.1.74 (Deoxycytidine Kinase)', ""EC 3.1.3.5 (5'-Nucleotidase)""]",IM,"[""5'-Nucleotidase/*metabolism"", 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Bryostatins', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cladribine/*pharmacology', 'Deoxycytidine Kinase/*metabolism', 'Drug Synergism', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Lactones/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/enzymology/metabolism/*pathology', 'Macrolides', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred ICR', 'Mice, SCID', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/metabolism', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein']",1998/11/20 00:00,1998/11/20 00:01,['1998/11/20 00:00'],"['1998/11/20 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/11/20 00:01 [medline]', '1998/11/20 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1515/bchm.1998.379.10.1253 [doi]'],ppublish,Biol Chem. 1998 Oct;379(10):1253-61. doi: 10.1515/bchm.1998.379.10.1253.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Synaptotagmin(s) (Syts) are a gene family of proteins that are implicated in the control of Ca2+-dependent exocytosis. In the present study, we investigated the possible occurrence and functional involvement of Syt in the control of mast cell exocytosis. Here, we demonstrate that both connective tissue type and mucosal-like mast cells express Syt-immunoreactive proteins, and that these proteins are localized almost exclusively to their secretory granules. Furthermore, expression of Syt I, the neuronal Ca2+ sensor, in rat basophilic leukemia cells (RBL-2H3), a tumor analogue of mucosal mast cells, resulted in prominent potentiation and acceleration of Ca2+-dependent exocytosis. Therefore, these findings implicate Syt as a Ca2+ sensor that mediates regulated secretion in mast cells to calcium ionophore.","['Baram, D', 'Linial, M', 'Mekori, Y A', 'Sagi-Eisenberg, R']","['Baram D', 'Linial M', 'Mekori YA', 'Sagi-Eisenberg R']","['Department of Cell Biology and Histology, Sackler School of Medicine, Tel Aviv University, Israel.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Calcium-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Nerve Tissue Proteins)', '0 (Synaptotagmin I)', '0 (Syt1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Syt1 protein, rat)', '134193-27-4 (Synaptotagmins)', '37H9VM9WZL (Calcimycin)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Blotting, Western', 'Calcimycin/pharmacology', 'Calcium/*physiology', '*Calcium-Binding Proteins', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Exocytosis/drug effects/*immunology', 'Leukemia, Basophilic, Acute', 'Mast Cells/*metabolism', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/immunology/metabolism/*physiology', 'Mice', 'Nerve Tissue Proteins/immunology/metabolism/*physiology', 'Rats', 'Subcellular Fractions/immunology/metabolism', 'Synaptotagmin I', 'Synaptotagmins', 'Transfection/immunology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1998/11/20 00:00,1998/11/20 00:01,['1998/11/20 00:00'],"['1998/11/20 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/11/20 00:01 [medline]', '1998/11/20 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Immunol. 1998 Nov 15;161(10):5120-3.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A register-based case-control study.,1244-9,"This report describes a population-based case-control study that aimed to assess and quantify the risk of children with congenital malformations developing cancer. Three sources of data were used: the Victorian Cancer Register, the Victorian Perinatal Data Register (VPDR) and the Victorian Congenital Malformations/Birth Defects Register. Cases included all Victorian children born between 1984 and 1993 who developed cancer. Four controls per case, matched on birth date, were randomly selected from the VPDR. Record linkage between registers provided malformation data. A matched case-control analysis was undertaken. Of the 632 cancer cases, 570 (90.2%) were linked to the VPDR. The congenital malformation prevalence in children with cancer was 9.6% compared with 2.5% in the controls [odds ratio (OR) 4.5, 95% CI 3.1-6.7]. A strong association was found with chromosomal defects (OR=16.7, 95% CI 6.1-45.3), in particular Down's syndrome (OR=27.1, 95% CI 6.0-122). Most other birth defect groups were also associated with increased cancer risk. The increased risk of leukaemia in children with Down's syndrome was confirmed, and children with central nervous system (CNS) defects were found to be at increased risk of CNS tumours. The report confirms that children with congenital malformations have increased risks of various malignancies. These findings may provide clues to the underlying aetiology of childhood cancer, as congenital malformations are felt to be a marker of exposures or processes which may increase cancer risk. The usefulness of record linkage between accurate population-based registers in the epidemiological study of disease has also been reinforced.","['Altmann, A E', 'Halliday, J L', 'Giles, G G']","['Altmann AE', 'Halliday JL', 'Giles GG']","['Consultative Council on Obstetric and Paediatric Mortality and Morbidity, Perinatal Data Collection Unit, Department of Human Services, Victoria, Australia.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Br J Cancer,British journal of cancer,0370635,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Australia/epidemiology', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'Congenital Abnormalities/*epidemiology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Neoplasms/*epidemiology', 'Registries', 'Risk Factors']",1998/11/20 00:00,1998/11/20 00:01,['1998/11/20 00:00'],"['1998/11/20 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/11/20 00:01 [medline]', '1998/11/20 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/bjc.1998.662 [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Cancer. 1998 Nov;78(9):1244-9. doi: 10.1038/bjc.1998.662.,,,PMC2062998,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have examined the possibility that retroviral gene expression may play a role in tumorigenesis. Evidence of virus-like particles in epididymis and seminal fluid is shown in electron micrographs. We identified expressed retroviral sequences by using RT-PCR to amplify a conserved retroviral reverse transcriptase coding region in RNA isolated from epididymis, testis, clarified seminal fluid and uterus. Phylogenetic analysis allowed us to classify the sequences into two distinct groups: (1) mammalian type-C viruses, having similarity to Moloney murine leukaemia virus, feline leukaemia virus and gibbon ape leukaemia virus amongst others; (2) a mixed ABCD group containing, for example, Chinese hamster and murine intracisternal A-particle virus sequences, mouse mammary tumour virus and human and simian retroviral sequences. The presence of putative full-length retrovirus related to mammalian type-C viruses in the epididymis and uterus was confirmed by Northern blot analysis. However, steroid treatment did not alter retroviral RNA levels in the epididymis or in a uterine tumour relative to untreated uterus. In summary, Syrian hamster reproductive tissues were found to express unique retroviral sequences; however, their role, if any, in hormonal carcinogenesis remains unresolved.","['DeHaven, J E', 'Schwartz, D A', 'Dahm, M W', 'Hazard, E S 3rd', 'Trifiletti, R', 'Lacy, E R', 'Norris, J S']","['DeHaven JE', 'Schwartz DA', 'Dahm MW', 'Hazard ES 3rd', 'Trifiletti R', 'Lacy ER', 'Norris JS']","['Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Medical University of South Carolina, Charleston 29425, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,J Gen Virol,The Journal of general virology,0077340,"['0 (RNA, Viral)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Cats', 'Cricetinae', 'Epididymis/*virology', 'Female', '*Genome, Viral', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Mesocricetus', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Phylogeny', 'RNA, Viral/*genetics', 'Retroviridae/genetics/*isolation & purification', 'Sequence Analysis', 'Uterus/*virology']",1998/11/20 06:38,2001/03/28 10:01,['1998/11/20 06:38'],"['1998/11/20 06:38 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1998/11/20 06:38 [entrez]']",['10.1099/0022-1317-79-11-2687 [doi]'],ppublish,J Gen Virol. 1998 Nov;79 ( Pt 11):2687-94. doi: 10.1099/0022-1317-79-11-2687.,['CA52085/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,"['GENBANK/AF052838', 'GENBANK/AF052839', 'GENBANK/AF052840', 'GENBANK/AF052841', 'GENBANK/AF052842', 'GENBANK/AF052843', 'GENBANK/AF052844', 'GENBANK/AF052845', 'GENBANK/AF052846', 'GENBANK/AF052847', 'GENBANK/AF052848', 'GENBANK/AF052849', 'GENBANK/AF052850', 'GENBANK/AF052851', 'GENBANK/AF052852', 'GENBANK/AF052853']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Group 1 includes cytosine arabinoside (Ara-C) (100 mg/m2/d, days 1-7) and idarubicin (Ida) (12 mg/m2/d, days 1-3) for induction, and Ara-C (200 mg/m2/d, days 1-6) and Ida (15 mg/m2/d, day 1) twice for consolidation. Group 2 includes Ara-C (200 mg/m2/d, days 1-10), daunorubicin (Dnc) (50 mg/m2/d, days 1, 3, 5) and etoposide (VP16) (100 mg/m2/d, days 1-5) for induction. The first consolidation therapy consisted of the same schedule except for Ara-C given on days 1-8. The second consolidation regimen consisted of Ara-C (200 mg/m2/d, days 1-8), VP16 (100 mg/m2/d, days 1-5) and amsacrine (100 mg/m2/d, days 1-5). Mitoxantrone (Mitox) (10 mg/m2/d, days 1-5) and Ara-C (200 mg/m2/d, days 1-3) were given as the third consolidation therapy. Group 3 was identical to Group 1 except for Ida being replaced with Mitox. During the study period 99 patients were enrolled and 34 were allocated randomly to Group 1, 36 to Group 2, and 29 to Group 3. Except for age distribution all patients' characteristics were similar between the groups. As there were more elderly patients in Group 1, time to complete remission (CR) was longer in this group as they needed more second induction. Induction deaths were 9.7%, 12.9% and 14.8% in Groups 1, 2 and 3, respectively. Patients in Group 2 received a higher amount of Ara-C compared with the other groups (P < 0.001). After a median follow-up period of 45 months (1-67 for survivors) an advantage in Group 1 was observed. Relapse-free survival (RFS) was better in Group 1 (P = 0.014) at 3 years. Fourteen of the patients were transplanted (11 allografts, 3 autografts). When patients with transplants were excluded, overall survival was longer in Group 1 both at 3 years and 5 years (P = 0.05).

The percentage of BM cells expressing CD34 was markedly elevated in patients with RAEB-T. A distinct finding in MDS patients was the expression of myeloid antigens on mononuclear BM cells. The proportion of individuals whose mononuclear BM cells were positive for surface reactivity with anti-CD13 and anti-CD33 mAbs was highest among RAEB-T patients while none of the patients with RA expressed these surface antigens. Cytoplasmic staining significantly increased the percentage of CD13+ and CD33+ BM cells among RAEB and RAEB-T patients. The proportion of individuals whose BM cells possessed myeloid antigens was increased by cytoplasmic staining in all subgroups of MDS. The BM of a considerable proportion of RAEB-T and RAEB patients showed cells which coexpressed the CD7 and CD3 lymphoid markers along with the CD13 and CD33 myeloid antigens. The present study indicates the importance of comparative surface and cytoplasmic immunophenotyping with CD13 and CD33 mAbs for the diagnosis of subgroups of MDS.

The primary tumors consisted of: 6 testicular, 2 ovarian, 2 breast and 1 renal cancers; 3 non-Hodgkin lymphomas; 1 acute myeloid and 1 chronic lymphatic leukemia; 1 melanoma, 1 uterine leiomyosarcoma, 1 liposarcoma, 1 osteosarcoma and 1 head and neck carcinoma. All the patients underwent a CT examination with contiguous 8-10 mm slices and thin (4-5 mm) detail slices or with the high resolution technique. All the cases had clinical, laboratory and pathologic confirmation of the drug-related lung damage. RESULTS: Four alveolar opacities, 11 interstitial opacities, 2 solitary and 4 multiple nodular lesions were demonstrated. Bleomycin was the most toxic drug in 14/21 cases, the total dose always exceeding 450 mg. Methotrexate followed and then cytosine-arabinoside (both 2/21). Bleomycin was responsible for all nodular lesions, cytosine-arabinoside and interleukin-2 for pulmonary edema. After drug discontinuation and appropriate treatment in 14 cases, we found favourable evolution with restitutio ad integrum (9 cases) or CT findings of clear improvement (5 cases); fibrosis progressed in 6 cases and one patient died. CONCLUSIONS: CT provides important information for the diagnosis of drug-induced lung damage. Despite the nonspecific patterns of the lesions, CT can demonstrate the early, and thus potentially reversible, stages of lung damage. CT is also very helpful in monitoring the onset, resolution, or progression of fibrosis.","['Ferrozzi, F', 'Schiavi, A', 'Ganzetti, A', 'Bassi, P', 'Campani, R']","['Ferrozzi F', 'Schiavi A', 'Ganzetti A', 'Bassi P', 'Campani R']","['Istituto di Scienze Radiologiche, Universita degli Studi, Parma. fferrozzi@netsis.it']",['ita'],['Journal Article'],Italy,Radiol Med,La Radiologia medica,0177625,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*adverse effects', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Lung Diseases/*chemically induced/*diagnostic imaging', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Retrospective Studies', '*Tomography, X-Ray Computed']",1998/11/20 00:00,1998/11/20 00:01,['1998/11/20 00:00'],"['1998/11/20 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/11/20 00:01 [medline]', '1998/11/20 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Radiol Med. 1998 Jul-Aug;96(1-2):62-7.,,,,,Lesioni iatrogene polmonari durante chemioterapia: aspetti con Tomografia Computerizzata.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Endogenous ETO also cosediments on sucrose gradients with mSin3A, N-CoR, and histone deacetylases, suggesting that it is a component of one or more corepressor complexes. Deletion mutagenesis indicates that ETO interacts with mSin3A independently of its association with N-CoR. Single amino acid mutations that impair the ability of ETO to interact with the central portion of N-CoR affect the ability of the t(8;21) fusion protein to repress transcription.

Having previously shown it to be a transcriptional repressor of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene promoter, we have now shown that PML's repression of EGFR transcription is caused by inhibition of EGFR's Sp1-dependent activity. On functional analysis, the repressive effect of PML was mapped to a 150-bp element (the sequences between -150 and -16, relative to the ATG initiation site) of the promoter. Transient transfection assays with Sp1-negative Drosophila melanogaster SL2 cells showed that the transcription of this region was regulated by Sp1 and that the Sp1-dependent activity of the promoter was suppressed by PML in a dose-dependent manner. Coimmunoprecipitation and mammalian two-hybrid assays demonstrated that PML and Sp1 were associated in vivo. In vitro binding by means of the glutathione S-transferase (GST) pull-down assay, using the full-length and truncated GST-Sp1 proteins and in vitro-translated PML, showed that PML and Sp1 directly interacted and that the C-terminal (DNA-binding) region of Sp1 and the coiled-coil (dimerization) domain of PML were essential for this interaction. Analysis of the effects of PML on Sp1 DNA binding by electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) showed that PML could specifically disrupt the binding of Sp1 to DNA. Furthermore, cotransfection of PML specifically repressed Sp1, but not the E2F1-mediated activity of the dihydrofolate reductase promoter. Together, these data suggest that the association of PML and Sp1 represents a novel mechanism for negative regulation of EGFR and other Sp1 target promoters.","['Vallian, S', 'Chin, K V', 'Chang, K S']","['Vallian S', 'Chin KV', 'Chang KS']","['Division of Laboratory Medicine, The University of Texas, Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas 77030, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (Sp1 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (ErbB Receptors)']",IM,"['Binding Sites/genetics', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics', 'ErbB Receptors/*genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation/genetics', 'Humans', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*metabolism', 'Nuclear Proteins/analysis', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/*genetics', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'Protein Binding/genetics', 'Repressor Proteins/genetics', 'Sequence Deletion/genetics', 'Sp1 Transcription Factor/*genetics', 'Transcription Factors/*metabolism', 'Transcription, Genetic/genetics', 'Transcriptional Activation/*genetics', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins']",1998/11/20 00:00,1998/11/20 00:01,['1998/11/20 00:00'],"['1998/11/20 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/11/20 00:01 [medline]', '1998/11/20 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/MCB.18.12.7147 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 1998 Dec;18(12):7147-56. doi: 10.1128/MCB.18.12.7147.,['CA-55577/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,PMC109296,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This observation is likely to relate to the findings that TAL1 and LMO are highly synergistic in T-cell tumorigenesis in double-transgenic mice. To understand the molecular mechanisms of functional synergy between TAL1 and LMO in tumorigenesis and transcriptional regulation, we tried to identify downstream target genes regulated by TAL1 and LMO by a subtractive PCR method. One of the isolated genes, that for retinaldehyde dehydrogenase 2 (RALDH2), was regularly expressed in most of the T-ALL cell lines that coexpressed TAL1 and LMO. Exogenously transfected TAL1 and LMO, but not either alone, induced RALDH2 expression in a T-ALL cell line, HPB-ALL, not expressing endogeneous TAL1 or LMO. The RALDH2 transcripts in T-ALL were, however, mostly initiated within the second intron. Promoter analysis revealed that a GATA site in a cryptic promoter in the second intron was essential and sufficient for the TAL1- and LMO-dependent transcriptional activation, and GATA3 binds to this site. In addition, forced expression of GATA3 potentiated the induction of RALDH2 by TAL1 and LMO, and these three factors formed a complex in vivo. Furthermore, a TAL1 mutant not binding to DNA also activated the transcription of RALDH2 in the presence of LMO and GATA3. Collectively, we have identified the RALDH2 gene as a first example of direct transcriptional target genes regulated by TAL1 and LMO in T-ALL. In this case, TAL1 and LMO act as cofactors for GATA3 to activate the transcription of RALDH2.","['Ono, Y', 'Fukuhara, N', 'Yoshie, O']","['Ono Y', 'Fukuhara N', 'Yoshie O']","['Shionogi Institute for Medical Science, Settsu-shi, Osaka 566-0022, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (GATA3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (GATA3 protein, human)', '0 (LIM Domain Proteins)', '0 (LMO1 protein, human)', '0 (LMO2 protein, human)', '0 (Metalloproteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '135471-20-4 (TAL1 protein, human)', 'EC 1.2.- (Aldehyde Oxidoreductases)', 'EC 1.2.1.36 (Retinal Dehydrogenase)']",IM,"['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing', 'Aldehyde Oxidoreductases/*genetics', 'Base Sequence', 'Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors', 'Cell Line', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics', 'GATA3 Transcription Factor', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic/*genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/*genetics', 'Genes, Reporter/genetics', 'Humans', 'LIM Domain Proteins', 'Metalloproteins/*genetics', 'Molecular Sequence Data', '*Oncogene Proteins', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*enzymology', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/genetics', '*Proto-Oncogene Proteins', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Retinal Dehydrogenase', 'T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1', 'T-Lymphocytes/*enzymology', 'Trans-Activators/*genetics', '*Transcription Factors', 'Transcription, Genetic/genetics', 'Transcriptional Activation/genetics']",1998/11/20 00:00,1998/11/20 00:01,['1998/11/20 00:00'],"['1998/11/20 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/11/20 00:01 [medline]', '1998/11/20 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/MCB.18.12.6939 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 1998 Dec;18(12):6939-50. doi: 10.1128/MCB.18.12.6939.,,,PMC109277,,,,"['GENBANK/AB015226', 'GENBANK/AB015227', 'GENBANK/AB015228', 'GENBANK/AB015229']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

IgE binding to and subsequent aggregation of the high-affinity receptor (Fc epsilon RI) by allergen plays a pivotal role in type I hypersensitivity responses. Earlier studies implicated the C epsilon 2 and 3 interface and the A-B loop in C epsilon 3 in the IgE-Fc epsilon RI interaction. These regions and glycosylation sites in C epsilon 3 were now targeted by site-specific mutagenesis. IgE binding to Fc epsilon RI was compared with surface plasmon resonance (SPR) measurements, which assessed the binding of the soluble extracellular domain of Fc epsilon RI to IgE. Kinetic analysis based on a pseudo-first-order model agrees with previous determinations. A more refined SPR-based kinetic analysis suggests a biphasic interaction. A model-free empirical analysis, comparing the binding strength and kinetics of native and mutant forms of IgE, identified changes in the kinetics of IgE-Fc epsilon RI interaction. Conservative substitutions introduced into the A-B loop have a small effect on binding, suggesting that the overall conformation of the loop is important for the complementary interaction, but multiple sites across the C epsilon 3 domain may influence IgE-Fc epsilon RI interactions. Asn394 is essential for the generation of a functional IgE molecule in mammalian cells. A role of Pro333 in the maintenance of a constrained conformation at the interface between C epsilon 2-3 emerged by studying the functional consequences of replacing this residue by Ala and Gly. These substitutions cause a dramatic decrease in the ability of the ligand to mediate stimulus secretion coupling, although only small changes in the association and dissociation rates are observed. Understanding the molecular basis of this phenomenon may provide important information for the design of inhibitors of mast cell degranulation.","['Sayers, I', 'Cain, S A', 'Swan, J R', 'Pickett, M A', 'Watt, P J', 'Holgate, S T', 'Padlan, E A', 'Schuck, P', 'Helm, B A']","['Sayers I', 'Cain SA', 'Swan JR', 'Pickett MA', 'Watt PJ', 'Holgate ST', 'Padlan EA', 'Schuck P', 'Helm BA']","['Krebs Institute for Biomolecular Research, MBB, University of Sheffield, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Biochemistry,Biochemistry,0370623,"['0 (Amino Acids)', '0 (Ligands)', '0 (Receptors, IgE)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '37341-29-0 (Immunoglobulin E)']",IM,"['Amino Acids/*physiology', 'Animals', 'Genetic Vectors', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin E/genetics/metabolism/*physiology', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Basophilic, Acute', 'Ligands', 'Models, Molecular', 'Mutagenesis, Site-Directed', 'Pichia/genetics', 'Protein Engineering', 'Rats', 'Receptor Aggregation', 'Receptors, IgE/genetics/metabolism/*physiology', 'Recombinant Proteins/biosynthesis/chemical synthesis/metabolism', 'Solubility', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1998/11/18 00:00,1998/11/18 00:01,['1998/11/18 00:00'],"['1998/11/18 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/11/18 00:01 [medline]', '1998/11/18 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1021/bi981456k [doi]', 'bi981456k [pii]']",ppublish,Biochemistry. 1998 Nov 17;37(46):16152-64. doi: 10.1021/bi981456k.,['Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These observations indicate that biphalin possesses anti-retroviral activity in vitro, suggesting that this opioid peptide should be examined further in vivo to determine if it is a candidate for combined therapy with AZT and possibly other drugs for retrovirus infections including the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).","['Tang, J L', 'Lipkowski, A W', 'Specter, S']","['Tang JL', 'Lipkowski AW', 'Specter S']","['Department of Medical Microbiology and Immunology, University of South Florida College of Medicine, Tampa 33612, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Int J Immunopharmacol,International journal of immunopharmacology,7904799,"['0 (Antiviral Agents)', '0 (Enkephalins)', '4B9XT59T7S (Zidovudine)', '83916-01-2 (biphalin)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase)']",IM,"['Antiviral Agents/*pharmacology', 'Cell Line', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Enkephalins/*pharmacology', 'Friend murine leukemia virus/*drug effects/physiology', 'Humans', 'RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase/metabolism', 'Virus Replication/drug effects', 'Zidovudine/*pharmacology']",1998/11/18 00:00,1998/11/18 00:01,['1998/11/18 00:00'],"['1998/11/18 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/11/18 00:01 [medline]', '1998/11/18 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0192-0561(98)00052-6 [pii]', '10.1016/s0192-0561(98)00052-6 [doi]']",ppublish,Int J Immunopharmacol. 1998 Sep;20(9):457-66. doi: 10.1016/s0192-0561(98)00052-6.,"['DA 07245/DA/NIDA NIH HHS/United States', 'DA 10161/DA/NIDA NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In order to investigate microbiological risk factors for treatment failures in more detail, Aspergillus spp. obtained from 29 patients with haematological diseases after myelo-ablative chemotherapy and bone marrow transplantation were analysed for their susceptibility to amphotericin B in vitro and this was compared with clinical outcome to see if there was a correlation. Aspergillus flavus was present in 12 (41 %) of the 29 patients, Aspergillus terreus in nine (31%) and Aspergillus fumigatus in eight (28%). The susceptibility of these isolates to amphotericin B varied between and within the three species. A. terreus was the only organism against which the MIC was consistently high, A. fumigatus and A. flavus showing variation between isolates in the degree of resistance to amphotericin B. The degree of in-vitro resistance was the only parameter correlating with clinical outcome in a univariate analysis and the only prognostic value in a multivariate analysis considering known risk factors. Irrespective of the species, all six patients with isolates against which the MIC was <2 mg/L survived, whereas most (22/23) of those with isolates resistant to > or = 2 mg/L died. Infections among the six survivors were caused by amphotericin B-susceptible A. fumigatus and A. flavus, but not A. terreus. We conclude that the outcome of aspergillus infection depends on the in-vitro susceptibility of the isolates to amphotericin B. Survival was poor in patients with isolates resistant to amphotericin B and good in those with amphotericin B-susceptible specimens. A. terreus was always associated with high resistance to amphotericin B and with poor survival.","['Lass-Florl, C', 'Kofler, G', 'Kropshofer, G', 'Hermans, J', 'Kreczy, A', 'Dierich, M P', 'Niederwieser, D']","['Lass-Florl C', 'Kofler G', 'Kropshofer G', 'Hermans J', 'Kreczy A', 'Dierich MP', 'Niederwieser D']","['Department of Hygiene, University of Innsbruck, Austria.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article']",England,J Antimicrob Chemother,The Journal of antimicrobial chemotherapy,7513617,"['0 (Antifungal Agents)', '7XU7A7DROE (Amphotericin B)']",IM,"['Amphotericin B/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Anemia, Aplastic/complications', 'Antifungal Agents/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Aspergillosis/complications/*drug therapy', 'Aspergillus/*drug effects/isolation & purification', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/complications', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/complications', 'Microbial Sensitivity Tests', 'Multiple Myeloma/complications', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'Prognosis', 'Risk Factors', 'Treatment Outcome']",1998/11/18 00:00,1998/11/18 00:01,['1998/11/18 00:00'],"['1998/11/18 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/11/18 00:01 [medline]', '1998/11/18 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/jac/42.4.497 [doi]'],ppublish,J Antimicrob Chemother. 1998 Oct;42(4):497-502. doi: 10.1093/jac/42.4.497.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Interferon (IFN) alpha administration has, on the other hand, been shown to induce not only a haematological but also cytogenetic response, i.e. partial or complete bone marrow repopulation by Ph-negative cells. This has triggered studies comparing IFN and conventional chemotherapy. The present work had the purpose to gain experience with IFN alpha treatment and compare the results with hydroxyurea and busulfan treatment, in the chronic phase of CML. METHODS AND RESULTS: Therapeutic results obtained in 30 patients given IFN alpha and 30 others given conventional chemotherapy were evaluated retrospectively. In spite of the short time of IFN administration (4-27 months), significantly more complete haematological responses (83%) were observed in this than the conventional chemotherapy group (57%). Cytogenetic responses were achieved in 36%, complete cytogenetic remission in 20% of IFN-treated patients. Conventional chemotherapy produced no cytogenetic effect. CONCLUSION: The results obtained confirm the value and efficacy of IFN-alpha treatment in CML patients, especially if it is started early and the dose is effective. Regular cytogenetic monitoring is necessary. Longer follow-up of the patients will be necessary for evaluation of the IFN effect on the length of their survival.","['Klamova, H', 'Vitek, A', 'Michalova, K', 'Brezinova, J', 'Moravcova, J', 'Jelinek, J', 'Cermak, J']","['Klamova H', 'Vitek A', 'Michalova K', 'Brezinova J', 'Moravcova J', 'Jelinek J', 'Cermak J']","['Ustav hematologie a krevni transfuze, Praha.']",['cze'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Czech Republic,Cas Lek Cesk,Casopis lekaru ceskych,0004743,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Interferon-alpha)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Interferon-alpha/*therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged']",1998/11/18 00:00,1998/11/18 00:01,['1998/11/18 00:00'],"['1998/11/18 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/11/18 00:01 [medline]', '1998/11/18 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cas Lek Cesk. 1998 Sep 21;137(18):552-6.,,,,,Interferon alfa--lek volby pro nemocne s chronickou myeloidni leukemii.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The median age of the patients was 49 f1p4s (range 44-60 years), and the median number of prior chemotherapy regimens was two. Patients were eligible for transplantation if they had chemosensitive disease and no morphologic evidence of malignant cells in the graft. Preparative regimens included cyclophosphamide and total-body-irradiation, with or without cytarabine, or BEAC. RESULTS: All patients engrafted and achieved a complete remission posttransplant. Ten patients were alive at a median of 41 months (range 22-125 months), and five were disease-free. Eight patients have relapsed and six have died (three from progressive malignancy).

E7010 binds to beta-tubulin and inhibits polymerization of microtubules. In order to clarify the mechanisms of E7010-resistance, two murine leukemic P388 subclones resistant to E7010, 0.5r-D and 4.0r-M, were characterized. The two clones showed approximately 10- and 100-fold resistance to E7010-induced growth-inhibitory effects, respectively, compared with the parental cells in 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay. These cell lines showed no cross-resistance to other anticancer agents such as taxanes, vinca alkaloids, mitomycin C, cisplatin and irinotecan hydrochloride (CPT-11). Increased alpha- and beta-tubulin protein and mRNA levels were observed in 0.5r-D and 4.0r-M cells as compared with the parental cells. We examined the isotype-specific expression of beta-tubulin in these E7010-resistant cells by a competitive reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction method. Although a 50% increase in beta 5 isotype mRNA levels was observed in 4.0r-M cells, the levels of beta 3 isotype message in the two resistant clones were approximately 50% less than the parental cells. To elucidate the binding properties of E7010 with beta-tubulin isotypes, we prepared isotype-specific fusion proteins of beta-tubulins. Direct photoaffinity labeling of the isotype-specific fusion proteins with [14C]E7010 revealed that E7010 preferentially binds to the beta 3 isotype rather than beta 2, beta 4, and beta 5 isotype proteins. Therefore, altered expression of beta-tubulin isotypes, especially beta 3 isotype, to which E7010 binds with high affinity, may account for the decreased sensitivity of these resistant clones to E7010.","['Iwamoto, Y', 'Nishio, K', 'Fukumoto, H', 'Yoshimatsu, K', 'Yamakido, M', 'Saijo, N']","['Iwamoto Y', 'Nishio K', 'Fukumoto H', 'Yoshimatsu K', 'Yamakido M', 'Saijo N']","['Pharmacology Division, National Cancer Center Hospital, Tokyo.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Japan,Jpn J Cancer Res,Japanese journal of cancer research : Gann,8509412,"['0 (Aminophenols)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Photoaffinity Labels)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Sulfonamides)', '0 (Tubulin)', '141430-65-1 (E 7010)']",IM,"['Aminophenols/*metabolism', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*metabolism', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Gene Expression', 'Humans', 'Immunosorbent Techniques', 'Leukemia P388', 'Mice', 'Photoaffinity Labels', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Sulfonamides/*metabolism', 'Tubulin/genetics/*metabolism']",1998/11/18 00:00,1998/11/18 00:01,['1998/11/18 00:00'],"['1998/11/18 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/11/18 00:01 [medline]', '1998/11/18 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0910505098800446 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1349-7006.1998.tb00654.x [doi]']",ppublish,Jpn J Cancer Res. 1998 Sep;89(9):954-62. doi: 10.1111/j.1349-7006.1998.tb00654.x.,,,PMC5921945,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Transgenic mice exhibited dwarfism with low IGF-I (29 +/- 9 ng/ml vs. wild type (WT) 137 +/- 16 ng/ml; P < 0.001), hypogonadism with low FSH (0.04 +/- 0.023 ng/ml vs. WT 0.63 +/- 0.18 ng/ml; P < 0.001), and Cushingoid features of thin skin and truncal obesity with elevated cortisol levels (86 +/- 22 ng/ml vs. WT 50 +/- 14 ng/ml; P = 0.002). Their pituitary glands showed corticotroph hyperplasia, striking somatotroph and gonadotroph hypoplasia, and multiple Rathke-like cysts lined by ciliated cells. LIF, overexpressed in Rathke's pouch at embryonal day 10, diverts the differentiation stream of hormone-secreting cells toward the corticotroph lineage and ciliated nasopharyngeal-like epithelium.

Identifying these patients is difficult, as patients with adverse prognostic features at presentation are rare and the majority are standard risk. Analysis of minimal residual disease (MRD) may be able to determine those at risk of relapse, but the best method by which this can be accomplished has yet to be defined. The object of this study was to determine the predictive value of residual disease detection in a group of standard-risk patients with precursor-B ALL at a fixed point in therapy (week 20) using a simple fluorescent consensus immunoglobulin H (IgH) heavy chain polymerase chain reaction (PCR). PATIENTS AND METHODS: Forty-two patients who presented with precursor-B ALL with standard-risk clinical features and treated according to either the Medical Research Council (MRC) UKALL X or XI protocols were assessed using a combination of both fluorescent consensus framework I and framework III Ig heavy-chain PCR. The results of the PCR were analyzed on an ABI 373 gene sequencer with genescan software (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Clonal rearrangements detected at presentation were looked for at week 20. RESULTS: Of 42 patients, 35 had a clonal population detectable at presentation; of these, seven had more than two clonal rearrangements; this latter group showed a similar disease-free survival (DFS) to the group as a whole. Thirty of 35 patients were analyzed before their second course of intensification therapy at week 20. At this point, nine of 30 had a detectable clonal rearrangement, eight (89%) of whom have since relapsed with a median DFS of 27.5 months. Of the rest of the group (n=21), in whom no clonal rearrangement was detectable, only six (21%) have relapsed. CONCLUSION: Fluorescent IgH PCR at week 20 provides a sensitive and specific means to predict ultimate relapse (57% and 89%, respectively) and is a simple yet promising technique for the identification of patients at risk of poor outcome.","['Evans, P A', 'Short, M A', 'Owen, R G', 'Jack, A S', 'Forsyth, P D', 'Shiach, C R', 'Kinsey, S', 'Morgan, G J']","['Evans PA', 'Short MA', 'Owen RG', 'Jack AS', 'Forsyth PD', 'Shiach CR', 'Kinsey S', 'Morgan GJ']","['Department of Haematology, The General Infirmary at Leeds, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,['0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Fluorescence', 'Gene Rearrangement, B-Lymphocyte, Heavy Chain', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Neoplasm, Residual/diagnosis', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction/*methods', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*diagnosis', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'Time Factors']",1998/11/17 00:00,1998/11/17 00:01,['1998/11/17 00:00'],"['1998/11/17 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/11/17 00:01 [medline]', '1998/11/17 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1200/JCO.1998.16.11.3616 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 1998 Nov;16(11):3616-27. doi: 10.1200/JCO.1998.16.11.3616.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The goals of the present study were to evaluate GW506U78, a prodrug of ara-G, against human hematologic malignancies and to determine its pharmacokinetics in plasma and cells. PATIENTS AND METHODS: During a phase I multicenter trial of GW506U78, 26 patients were treated at M.D. Anderson Cancer Center (MDACC). Daily doses between 20 and 60 mg/kg were administered for 5 days. Parallel plasma and cellular pharmacokinetic studies were conducted. RESULTS: Complete (n=5) or partial remission (n=5) was achieved in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL), T-lymphoid blast crisis, T-lymphoma, and B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL) (n=13). In contrast, patients with B-ALL, B-lymphoma, acute myelogenous leukemia (AMI), or T-CLL did not respond. Peak plasma concentrations of GW506U78 and ara-G were dose-dependent. The elimination of GW506U78 (half-life [t1/2]=17 minutes) was faster than the elimination of ara-G (t1/2=3.7 hours). Median peak concentrations of ara-GTP were 23, 42, 85, and 93 micromol/L at 20, 30, 40, and 60 mg/kg, respectively. T-lymphoblasts accumulated significantly (P=.0008) higher peak arabinsylguanosine triphosphate (ara-GTP) (median, 140 micromol/L; n=7) compared with other diagnoses (median, 50 micromol/L; n=9) and normal mononuclear cells (n=3). The ara-GTP elimination was slow in all diagnoses (median, > 24 hours). Responders accumulated significantly (P=.0005) higher levels of ara-GTP (median, 157 micromol/L) compared with patients who failed to respond (median, 44 micromol/L). CONCLUSION: GW506U78 is an effective prodrug and a potent agent for hematologic malignancies with major efficacy in T-cell diseases. The pharmacokinetics of ara-GTP in leukemia cells are strongly correlated with clinical responses to GW506U78.","['Gandhi, V', 'Plunkett, W', 'Rodriguez, C O Jr', 'Nowak, B J', 'Du, M', 'Ayres, M', 'Kisor, D F', 'Mitchell, B S', 'Kurtzberg, J', 'Keating, M J']","['Gandhi V', 'Plunkett W', 'Rodriguez CO Jr', 'Nowak BJ', 'Du M', 'Ayres M', 'Kisor DF', 'Mitchell BS', 'Kurtzberg J', 'Keating MJ']","['Department of Clinical Investigation, The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston 77030, USA. vgandhi@notes.mdacc.tmc.edu']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Clinical Trial, Phase I', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Arabinonucleosides)', '0 (Arabinonucleotides)', '0 (Prodrugs)', '38819-10-2 (9-arabinofuranosylguanine)', '60158CV180 (nelarabine)', ""72490-81-4 (9-beta-D-arabinofuranosylguanosine 5'-triphosphate)"", '86-01-1 (Guanosine Triphosphate)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Arabinonucleosides/chemistry/pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use', 'Arabinonucleotides/metabolism', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Guanosine Triphosphate/analogs & derivatives/metabolism', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*drug therapy', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, B-Cell/drug therapy', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/drug therapy', 'Multicenter Studies as Topic', 'Prodrugs/therapeutic use', 'Time Factors', 'Treatment Outcome']",1998/11/17 03:04,2001/03/28 10:01,['1998/11/17 03:04'],"['1998/11/17 03:04 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1998/11/17 03:04 [entrez]']",['10.1200/JCO.1998.16.11.3607 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 1998 Nov;16(11):3607-15. doi: 10.1200/JCO.1998.16.11.3607.,"['CA32839/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA57629/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: We studied late events in 387 patients treated for pediatric Hodgkin's disease on four consecutive clinical trials at St Jude Children's Research Hospital from 1968 to 1990. Relative risks, actuarial risks, and absolute excess risks for cause-specific deaths were calculated. RESULTS: As of April 1997, 316 (82%) of patients were alive, with a median follow-up of 15.1 (range, 2.9 to 28.6) years. In this cohort, which represented 5,623 person-years of follow-up, 71 fatal events resulted from Hodgkin's disease (n=36), second malignancies (n=14), infections (n=7), accidents (n=7), cardiac disease (n=6), and asphyxiation (n=1). The 5-year estimated event-free survival (EFS) for the entire cohort was 79.6%+/-2.1 %, which declined to 63.1%+/-4.4% by 20 years. Cumulative incidences of cause-specific deaths at 25 years were 9.8%+/-1.6% for Hodgkin's disease, 8.1%+/-2.6% for second malignancy, 4.0%+/-1.8% for cardiac disease, 3.9%+/-1.5% for infection, and 2.1%+/-0.8% for accidents. Standardized incidence ratios showed excess risk for all second malignancies (12; 95% confidence interval [CI], 8 to 17), acute myeloid leukemia (81; 95% CI, 16 to 237), solid tumors (11; 95% CI, 7 to 16), and breast cancer (33; 95% CI, 12 to 72). Standardized mortality ratios also showed excess mortality from cardiac disease (22; 95% CI, 8 to 48) and infection (18; 95% CI, 7 to 38).

One approach to delineating replication errors in cancer cells is to determine the alterations of microsatellites, which are short, repeated nucleotide sequences existing throughout the genomes. We used a fluorescent system to assess microsatellite changes in seven loci (D2S123, D3S643, D5S107, LPL, D17S261, TP53, and D18S34) of 73 consecutive patients with various hematological neoplasias. De novo acute leukemia patients had a low frequency (<1%) of microsatellite alterations at each locus, and none of them demonstrated multiple microsatellite changes. In chronic myeloid leukemia patients, no microsatellite instability was detected in the chronic phase, whereas a relatively high frequency (25%) of multiple microsatellite changes was evident in the blastic phase, and half of these patients had multiple microsatellite changes. About 50% of the patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and post-MDS acute myeloid leukemia (post-MDS AML) had microsatellite alterations. We next compared microsatellite alterations in two different hematological phases (MDS and post-MDS AML phases); 5 of 11 patients with post-MDS AML had de novo appearance of microsatellite instability during disease progression. This indicates that genomic instability at multiple microsatellite loci could occur either before or after leukemic transformation in MDS patients. We concluded that genomic instability in chronic myeloid leukemia might be linked to blastic transformation in combination with cytogenetic changes. In contrast, MDS patients had replication errors as a relatively early genetic event as well as a late genetic event. These results suggest that the involvement of genomic instability in the progression of disease is different among various types of leukemia.","['Ohyashiki, J H', 'Ohyashiki, K', 'Aizawa, S', 'Kawakubo, K', 'Shimamoto, T', 'Iwama, H', 'Hayashi, S', 'Toyama, K']","['Ohyashiki JH', 'Ohyashiki K', 'Aizawa S', 'Kawakubo K', 'Shimamoto T', 'Iwama H', 'Hayashi S', 'Toyama K']","['First Department of Internal Medicine, Tokyo Medical College, 6-7-1 Nishi-shinjuku, Shinjuku-ku, Tokyo 160, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)']",IM,"['*DNA Replication', 'DNA, Neoplasm/chemistry/genetics', 'Disease Progression', 'Fluorescence', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/genetics', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/genetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics', 'Loss of Heterozygosity', 'Microsatellite Repeats/*genetics', 'Mutation', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/genetics', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction/methods']",1996/09/01 00:00,1998/11/17 00:01,['1996/09/01 00:00'],"['1996/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/11/17 00:01 [medline]', '1996/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 1996 Sep;2(9):1583-9.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Bizelesin was evaluated for antitumor activity against a broad spectrum of syngeneic murine tumors and human tumor xenografts in mice. Systemic drug administration produced >6.7 log10 cell kill against i.p. implanted P388 and L1210 leukemias and 80% tumor-free survivors against s.c. implanted L1210. Against i.p. implanted B16 melanoma, i.p. drug administration produced a 158%; increase in life span with 25% tumor-free survivors, whereas i.v. drug administration produced only a 67% increase in life span with no tumor-free survivors. More than 1.0 log10 cell kill was observed at low microgram/kg doses in several human tumor models representing diverse histiotypes (CAKI-1 renal, LX-1 lung, HT-29 colon, LOX IMVI and UACC-62 melanomas, and MX-1 mammary). Less than 1.0 log10 cell kill was exhibited in other tumor models (Lewis lung, colon 38, pancreatic 02, MCF7 mammary, and SK-MEL-3 melanoma). Bizelesin was optimally active when administered i.v. Although antitumor activity was independent of the schedule of administration, greater total doses were tolerated on the more prolonged schedules in any given experiment. Therapeutic doses of bizelesin did not produce delayed deaths, which had previously been observed for the parent compound CC-1065. However, recovery of lost weight was not attained until 16-30 days posttherapy. Bizelesin was as active against murine leukemia sublines resistant to cisplatin, melphalan, and 1,3-bis-(2-chloroethyl)-1-nitrosourea as against the parental line but was totally inactive against a doxorubicin-resistant subline. The complete cross-resistance of the doxorubicin-resistant subline to bizelesin suggests that bizelesin may be a substrate for the efflux pump that causes multidrug resistance. Due to its breadth of antitumor activity, potency, unique mechanism of action, and lack of cross-resistance with other alkylating agents, bizelesin was selected for development in clinical trials by the National Cancer Institute and the Upjohn Company.

In view of the recently reported potential of stem cell factor (SCF) in restoring erythropoiesis in combination with erythropoietin (Epo), we first aimed to define a correlation between SCF serum levels and anemia in MDS. Endogenous SCF levels in 50 MDS patients were determined by using a quantitative sandwich enzyme immunoassay. Broad interindividual variations were observed, but SCF serum levels were in the normal range with no correlation to peripheral blood count. A soft agar culture system was used to further define the role of SCF for stimulation of erythroid growth. Bone marrow mononucleated cells of 20 MDS patients (4 refractory anemia, 5 refractory anemia with excess of blasts, 7 refractory anemia with excess of blasts in transition, and 4 chronic myelomonocytic leukemia) were investigated, and SCF plus Epo was able to stimulate burst-forming unit-erythroid significantly more than SCF or Epo alone independent of French-American-British group. When mononucleated cells from six MDS patients (two refractory anemia, two refractory anemia with excess of blasts, and 2 refractory anemia with excess of blasts in transition) with elevated serum Epo levels were incubated in the presence of SCF and autologous serum, a significant dose-dependent stimulation of burst-forming unit-erythroid number and cells per colony was detected. Erythroid differentiation was further enhanced by adding serum with high colony-stimulating activity obtained from patients with severe aplastic anemia. Our data suggest that in MDS patients with high endogenous Epo serum levels SCF alone might be effective in stimulating erythropoiesis in vivo.","['Zwierzina, H', 'Bammer, T', 'Rollinger-Holzinger, I', 'Herold, M', 'Fenaux, P', 'Nussler, V', 'Hoflehner, E', 'Geissler, D']","['Zwierzina H', 'Bammer T', 'Rollinger-Holzinger I', 'Herold M', 'Fenaux P', 'Nussler V', 'Hoflehner E', 'Geissler D']","['Medizinische Universitatsklinik Innsbruck, Anichstrabetae 35, A-6020 Innsbruck, Austria.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,"['0 (Stem Cell Factor)', '11096-26-7 (Erythropoietin)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Blood Transfusion, Autologous', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Erythropoiesis/*drug effects', 'Erythropoietin/*blood', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/blood/*drug therapy', 'Stem Cell Factor/blood/*pharmacology']",1996/06/01 00:00,1998/11/17 00:01,['1996/06/01 00:00'],"['1996/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/11/17 00:01 [medline]', '1996/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 1996 Jun;2(6):1031-8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Transferrin, the iron transport protein, increases gallium uptake by cells, whereas pyridoxal isonicotinoyl hydrazone (PIH), an iron chelator, transports iron into cells. Therefore, we examined whether these metal transporters would increase the cytotoxicity of gallium in gallium nitrate-resistant CCRF-CEM cells. Transferrin, in increasing concentrations, enhanced the cytotoxicity of gallium nitrate. One mg/ml transferrin decreased the 50% inhibitory concentration of gallium nitrate from 1650 to 75 micrometer in gallium-resistant cells and from 190 to 150 micrometer in gallium-sensitive cells. Transferrin also enhanced the cytotoxicity of gallium even at drug concentrations that were not growth inhibitory. The gallium chelate Ga-PIH inhibited the growth of both gallium nitrate-resistant and -sensitive cells. Fifty micrometer Ga-PIH inhibited cellular proliferation by 50%, whereas similar concentrations of PIH or gallium nitrate were not growth inhibitory. However, because higher concentrations of PIH also inhibited cell growth, the cytotoxicity of Ga-PIH was greater than PIH only at concentrations of <100 micrometer. Cross-titration experiments demonstrated that the cytotoxicity of PIH was partially reversed by gallium nitrate, whereas the cytotoxicity of gallium nitrate was enhanced by PIH. Our studies suggest that Ga-PIH warrants further evaluation as a potential antineoplastic agent. Because transferrin increases the cytotoxicity of gallium nitrate in transferrin receptor-bearing, gallium nitrate-resistant cells, future clinical trials of this drug should incorporate the development of strategies to increase plasma transferrin levels.","['Chitambar, C R', 'Boon, P', 'Wereley, J P']","['Chitambar CR', 'Boon P', 'Wereley JP']","['Division of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Medicine, Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, Wisconsin 53226, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Transferrin)', '3THM379K8A (Pyridoxal)', '737-86-0 (pyridoxal isonicotinoyl hydrazone)', 'CH46OC8YV4 (Gallium)', 'V83O1VOZ8L (Isoniazid)', 'VRA0C6810N (gallium nitrate)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Gallium/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Isoniazid/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*drug therapy', 'Pyridoxal/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Transferrin', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1996/06/01 00:00,1998/11/17 00:01,['1996/06/01 00:00'],"['1996/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/11/17 00:01 [medline]', '1996/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 1996 Jun;2(6):1009-15.,['R01 CA68028/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Telomerase, a ribonucleoprotein that synthesizes telomeric DNA onto chromosomal ends, is activated in germline cells and almost all tumor cells. Telomerase activity maintains the stability of telomere length, resulting in indefinite cellular proliferation (immortality). In the present study, telomerase activity was analyzed in leukemic mononuclear blood cells obtained from 56 patients with acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) with known cytogenetic alterations. Heterogenous levels of telomerase activity were observed and generally correlated with cytogenetic status. Patients with 11q abnormalities and -5/-7 (unfavorable cytogenetics) tended to have high telomerase activity compared with cells obtained from AML patients with other types of cytogenetics. Additional studies with a larger cohort of patients will determine whether these differences are statistically significant. Chemotherapy agents that result in differentiation of leukemic cells also resulted in inhibition of telomerase activity. Knowledge of telomerase activity in patients with AML, before and throughout therapy, may have clinical utility for following disease progression and may predict early cancer relapse.","['Zhang, W', 'Piatyszek, M A', 'Kobayashi, T', 'Estey, E', 'Andreeff, M', 'Deisseroth, A B', 'Wright, W E', 'Shay, J W']","['Zhang W', 'Piatyszek MA', 'Kobayashi T', 'Estey E', 'Andreeff M', 'Deisseroth AB', 'Wright WE', 'Shay JW']","['Departments of Neuro-Oncology and Hematology, University of Texas M.

One of the enantiomers of MDAM, which possesses the natural configuration at the gamma-methyleneglutamate moiety (l-MDAM), has been shown to be a better inhibitor of human recombinant dihydrofolate reductase and H35 hepatoma cell growth than D,L-MDAM. L-MDAM inhibited the uptake of radiolabeled folinic acid to H35 hepatoma cells eight times more efficiently than MTX. The results indicate that the superior activity of MDAM relative to MTX may be partially due to a combination of enhanced transport to tumor cells and slower deactivation by aldehyde oxidase.","['Cao, S', 'Abraham, A', 'Nair, M G', 'Pati, R', 'Galivan, J H', 'Hausheer, F H', 'Rustum, Y M']","['Cao S', 'Abraham A', 'Nair MG', 'Pati R', 'Galivan JH', 'Hausheer FH', 'Rustum YM']","['Roswell Park Cancer Institute, Buffalo, New York 14263, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Folic Acid Antagonists)', '0 (gamma-methylene-10-deazaaminopterin)', '25513-46-6 (Polyglutamic Acid)', 'JYB41CTM2Q (Aminopterin)', 'Q573I9DVLP (Leucovorin)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Aminopterin/*analogs & derivatives/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Female', 'Folic Acid Antagonists/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leucovorin/pharmacokinetics', 'Methotrexate/pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred DBA', 'Polyglutamic Acid/*metabolism']",1996/04/01 00:00,1998/11/17 00:01,['1996/04/01 00:00'],"['1996/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/11/17 00:01 [medline]', '1996/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 1996 Apr;2(4):707-12.,"['CA25933/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA27101/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA65761/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

During continuous infusion of ara-C, however, serum ara-C levels are <10 microM. Because the effectiveness of ara-C depends on the levels of intracellular ara-CTP and its incorporation into DNA, we sought to investigate the influence of fludarabine on pharmacodynamics of ara-C at concentrations of ara-C achieved during continuous infusion. Using the K562 human leukemic cell line, we established that incubation with 30 microM F-ara-A was able to modulate intracellular dNTP pools and achieve maximum enhancement of ara-CTP levels at all concentrations of ara-C tested (0.3-10.0 microM). The relative enhancement of ara-CTP concentrations ranged from 2.2- to 2.8-fold. Combination of F-ara-A with 1.0 and 3.0 microM ara-C also increased the incorporation of ara-CTP into DNA. To model the influence of F-ara-A on continuous infusion ara-C, cells were incubated with 1 microM ara-C alone or in combination with F-ara-A. The F-ara-A-incubated cells accumulated effective intracellular concentrations of F-ara-ATP, which resulted in greatly increased intracellular ara-CTP levels. These studies demonstrate the capacity of clinically attainable concentrations of F-ara-ATP to enhance the formation of ara-CTP at concentrations of ara-C that are achieved during a continuous infusion schedule. Given the important role intracellular ara-CTP concentrations and ara-CMP incorporation into DNA have on the ultimate cytotoxic capacity of ara-C against acute myelogenous leukemia blasts, these studies suggest a promising pharmacological model for improving the efficacy of the continuous infusion ara-C regimen.","['Seymour, J F', 'Huang, P', 'Plunkett, W', 'Gandhi, V']","['Seymour JF', 'Huang P', 'Plunkett W', 'Gandhi V']","['Department of Clinical Investigation, University of Texas M.

We measured chemosensitivity of human tumor cell lines (n = 11), with or without wild-type p53, following exposure to clinically useful chemotherapeutic drugs (n = 4). Chemosensitivity and apoptosis induction were correlated independently of p53 status or Bcl-2 protein levels in vitro. Wild-type p53 correlated with chemosensitivity in ovarian carcinoma and some Burkitt's lymphoma cells, but not in leukemia or lung cancer. Bcl-2 levels correlated with chemoresistance only in Burkitt's lymphoma. p53-dependent p21(WAF1/CIP1) induction and cell cycle arrest occurred at sublethal doses of chemotherapy, whereas at lethal doses of chemotherapy apoptotic death was observed, consistent with models proposing a relationship between the level of DNA damage versus survival or death. Loss of apoptosis induction was observed in drug-resistant ML-1 and HL-60 leukemia cells, without changes in p53 or Bcl-2. Targeted loss of p53 protein in H460 lung cancer cells using HPV-16 E6 inhibited the etoposide-induced G1 checkpoint but did not decrease chemosensitivity. Our studies suggest that the simple measurement of apoptosis induction may be a useful predictor of chemosensitivity, at least in vitro, and confirm that p53 status and Bcl-2 expression may be useful predictors of chemosensitivity in certain cell types.","['Wu, G S', 'El-Deiry, W S']","['Wu GS', 'El-Deiry WS']","['Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Laboratory of Molecular Oncology, Department of Medicine and Genetics, University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine and Comprehensive Cancer Center, Philadelphia, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,"['0 (CDKN1A protein, human)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21)', '0 (Cyclins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)']",IM,"['*Apoptosis', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21', 'Cyclins/physiology', 'DNA Fragmentation', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Humans', 'Neoplasms/chemistry/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*physiology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/analysis/*physiology']",1996/04/01 00:00,1998/11/17 00:01,['1996/04/01 00:00'],"['1996/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/11/17 00:01 [medline]', '1996/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 1996 Apr;2(4):623-33.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The in vitro immunization of peripheral blood lymphocytes from four patients in remission (S. R., F. R., M. M., P. G.) with BCR1/25, a 25-mer pml/RAR-alpha, did not elicit either a polyclonal or a clonal immune response specific to the peptide. We then generated new donor anti-pml/RAR-alpha CD4(+) T-cell clones. These clones were tested for their recognition of BCR1/25. One clone (C3/5, CD3(+), CD4(+), CD8(-)) was selected for further analysis. Clone C3/5 showed specific proliferation, cytotoxicity, and cytokine (tumor necrosis factor alpha, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor) production when challenged with autologous lymphoblastic cell lines pulsed with peptide BCR1/25. C3/5 cells developed specific proliferation and cytotoxicity when challenged with peptide-pulsed lymphoblastic cell lines and peripheral blood lymphocytes from the four DR11(+) APL patients. APL blasts, available only from patients F. R. and P. G., were not lysed by C3/5 and were unable to present peptide BCR1/25. Incubation of APL cells with IFN-gamma failed to induce HLA class II molecules and recognition by the C3/5 clone. Since APL cells do not express HLA class II molecules, we tested in two donors (D. E. and C. H. R.) and in patients S. R. and P. G. whether the use of 9-mer peptides (BCR1/9) would generate a CD8/HLA class I-restricted response. No peptide-specific T-cell line or clone could be generated from both donors and patients.

We undertook a dose-ranging study to examine the safety, clinical tolerance, and pharmacokinetics of 9-cis RA in patients with advanced cancer. Thirty-four patients received once daily p.o. doses of 9-cis RA (administered as LGD1057) ranging from 5 to 230 mg/m2 for 4 weeks. Pharmacokinetic studies were performed on 28 patients at seven dose levels. 9-cis RA was generally well tolerated. Headache was the most common dose-limiting adverse effect. Other prominent reactions included facial flushing, myalgia, dyspnea, hypertriglyceridemia, and hypercalcemia. Relative to other retinoids, mucocutaneous reactions were mild. No major antitumor responses were observed. Pharmacokinetic analysis revealed that the day 1 area under the plasma concentration x time curves (AUCs) were proportional to the dose. Up through doses of 140 mg/m2, the day 1 AUCs were similar to those on days 15 and 29. At higher doses, however, AUCs tended to decline with repeat dosing. 9-cis RA is a novel compound that exploits a newly identified pathway of retinoid receptor biology that may be relevant to tumor cell proliferation and differentiation.

The TRX system, consisting of TRX, TRX reductase, and NADPH, has an intracellular reducing capacity. Another reducing capacity, glutathione (GSH), can be associated with cis-diaminedichloroplatinum (cDDP) resistance. Therefore, we examined the involvement of TRX in cDDP resistance using two cell lines designated St/DDP and HT/DDP, which were established from the human gastric cancer cell line St-4 and the colon cancer cell line HT-29. St/DDP and HT/DDP were seven and five times as resistant to cDDP as their parental lines, and the expression of TRX in these variants was increased by 2.5- and 2-fold, respectively. The expression of TRX in the complete revertant cells of St/DDP was reduced as low as that in St-4 cells. TRX reductase activity was also increased in St/DDP and HT/DDP, suggesting that activation of the TRX system was associated with in vitro-acquired cDDP resistance. Because cDDP is the first-line drug against ovarian cancer, we examined the expression of TRX in 11 human ovarian cancer cell lines not treated with cDDP in vitro. Positive correlation between TRX expression and cDDP resistance was observed in these cell lines (r = 0.76, P = 0.007). This correlation was comparable to that between GSH content and cDDP resistance (r = 0.69, P = 0.019).

However, effective compounds for reversal of MRP-related MDR are limited. In the present study, the modulatory activity of the novel pyridine analogue PAK-104P on MRP-mediated resistance to doxorubicin and paclitaxel was investigated in two doxorubicin-selected human tumor cell lines [HT1080/DR4 (sarcoma) and HL60/ADR (leukemia)] and compared with the nonimmunosuppressive cyclosporine analogue PSC-833. In cell lines HT1080/DR4 (MRP/lung resistance-related protein phenotype) and HL60/ADR (MRP phenotype), doxorubicin resistance was significantly higher (250-fold and 180-fold, respectively) than that to paclitaxel (6-fold and 9-fold, respectively).

In contrast, PSC-833 modulation of doxorubicin and paclitaxel resistance was modest. Cellular drug uptake and retention studies by flow cytometry analysis demonstrated that PAK-104P was effective in restoring cellular doxorubicin concentrations in resistant cells to levels comparable to those obtained in parental cells. In athymic nude mice, PAK-104P significantly potentiated the therapeutic efficacy of doxorubicin and paclitaxel against resistant HT1080/DR4 xenografts. Of significance is that the maximum tolerated doses of doxorubicin and paclitaxel were administered in combination with PAK-104P, documenting improvement in the therapeutic index of these agents.

We showed previously that anti-interleukin 6 (IL-6) and antitransferrin (Tf) receptor antibodies inhibited in vitro growth and induced death of myeloma cells. Retinoids also inhibit in vitro growth of human cancer cells and decrease IL-6 receptor display and autosecretion by some myeloma cells. Retinoids may also antagonize in vitro growth-promoting effects of iron and transferrin. To develop a novel strategy for treating myeloma, we examined antiproliferative and cytotoxic effects of retinoids in combination with anti-Tf or anti-IL-6 receptor antibodies. Myeloma cell lines were cultured with retinoids with or without anti-growth factor receptor monoclonal antibodies. Both all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) and 13-cis-retinoic acid showed variable, dose-dependent inhibition of myeloma cell line growth. ATRA also induced significant down-regulation of myeloma IL-6 receptors and inhibited IL-6 autosecretion by myeloma cells. Antiproliferative effects of ATRA were increased by coculture with anti-Tf but not anti-IL-6 receptor antibodies. Colony-forming assays showed that antiproliferative effects of anti-Tf receptor antibodies were largely reversible, but 1 microM ATRA was cytotoxic to myeloma cells. To assess apoptosis, a flow cytometry assay detecting DNA damage was used. Using previously studied cell line models, flow cytometry detected programmed cell death induced by transforming growth factor beta1 in leukemia cells and by anti-growth factor receptor antibody treatment of IL-6-dependent myeloma cells, treatments which caused only modest increases in the percentage of cells undergoing morphological apoptosis and increased internucleosomal DNA degradation. Flow cytometry analysis of ATRA and anti-Tf antibody-treated myeloma cells also showed evidence for apoptosis induced by ATRA, but not with anti-Tf receptor antibodies.

Fourteen patients received 27 courses of TPT at doses ranging from 3.5 to 5.75 mg/m2/day every 3 weeks. A constellation of unusual adverse effects, consisting of high fever, rigors, precipitous anemia, and hyperbilirubinemia, was the principal dose-limiting toxicity of high doses of TPT on this schedule. These toxicities were consistently intolerable at the 5.75 mg/m2/day dose level; however, they were neither severe nor common at lower doses. Although the precise etiology of these effects is not known, high doses of TPT may induce acute hemolytic reactions in this patient population. Severe, albeit transient, mucositis was experienced by two of eight patients in 2 of 17 courses at the next lower dose level, 4.5 mg/m2/day, which was determined to be the maximum tolerated dose and the dose recommended for further trials. The pharmacokinetic behavior of TPT at high doses was not dose dependent and resembled that at lower doses. In view of preclinical data suggesting that TPT sensitivity might correlate with topo I levels, topo I content in leukemia blasts was assessed by Western blotting. Variations in topo I content were observed. Moreover, strong correlations were evident between topo I content and two markers of proliferation, proliferating cell nuclear antigen and nuclear protein B23, raising the possibility that differences in topo I content observed among various leukemia specimens might reflect differences in the proliferating fractions of cells in various leukemia samples. Although complete clearance of circulating leukemia blasts occurred in most courses, neither sustained responses nor hematopoietic recovery were observed in the heavily pretreated, poor-risk patients enrolled in this study, and it was not possible to correlate these differences in topo I content with clinical response. These results indicate that substantial dose escalation of TPT as a 30-minute infusion for a 5-day schedule above myelosuppressive doses is feasible in adults with refractory or relapsed leukemias; however, further development of alternate high-dose schedules in leukemia may be warranted in view of the nature of the dose-limiting toxicity and the lack of sustained clinical responses in this preliminary investigation.","['Rowinsky, E K', 'Kaufmann, S H', 'Baker, S D', 'Miller, C B', 'Sartorius, S E', 'Bowling, M K', 'Chen, T L', 'Donehower, R C', 'Gore, S D']","['Rowinsky EK', 'Kaufmann SH', 'Baker SD', 'Miller CB', 'Sartorius SE', 'Bowling MK', 'Chen TL', 'Donehower RC', 'Gore SD']","['Divisions of Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics, Medical Oncology, and Hematological Malignancies, The Johns Hopkins Oncology Center, Baltimore, Maryland 21287, USA.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Clinical Trial, Phase I', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '7M7YKX2N15 (Topotecan)', 'EC 5.99.1.2 (DNA Topoisomerases, Type I)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use', 'Bone Marrow/enzymology', 'DNA Topoisomerases, Type I/metabolism', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy/enzymology/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mucous Membrane/pathology', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local', 'Topotecan/administration & dosage/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use', 'Treatment Outcome']",1996/12/01 00:00,1998/11/17 00:01,['1996/12/01 00:00'],"['1996/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/11/17 00:01 [medline]', '1996/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 1996 Dec;2(12):1921-30.,['CA 44358/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this Phase I study, carzelesin was given daily for 5 consecutive days to (a) determine the maximum tolerable dose (MTD) and the pattern of toxicity of this schedule; (b) define the pharmacokinetic profile of the parent, as was done for the intermediate compound U-76073 and the DNA-reactive agent U-76074; and (c) document any antitumor activity observed. Carzelesin was given as a 10-min infusion with a constant-rate infusion pump. Treatment was repeated every 4 weeks or when blood counts had recovered to normal values. The starting dose of 12 microgram/m2/day was escalated by 20-30% increments until the MTD (defined as the dose leading to grade 4 hematological or grade 3 nonhematological toxicity in at least two of six patients) was reached. Pharmacokinetic studies were planned on days 1 and 5 of the first cycle in at least two patients per dose level. Plasma levels of carzelesin, U-76073, and U-76074 were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography with UV detection and a detection limit of 0.5 ng/ml. Twenty-five patients were entered in the study, and 56 cycles were evaluable for hematological toxicity. Subsequent dose levels evaluated were 24, 30, 35, and 40 microgram/m2. Both neutropenia and thrombocytopenia were dose limiting and cumulative, with a high interpatient variability. Neutropenia occurred earlier (median time to neutrophil nadir and recovery, 15 and 29 days, respectively) than thrombocytopenia (median time to platelet nadir and recovery, 25 and >/=26 days, respectively); there were delays of treatment because of persisting thrombocytopenia in all patients treated at the MTD. At the MTD, the peak plasma concentrations of carzelesin were achieved at the end of the infusion and were higher than those found cytotoxic in vitro against tumor cell lines. Carzelesin was detectable up to a maximum of 1 h after the infusion. Smaller amounts of U-76073 were detectable for a maximum of 30 min only at the MTD, whereas U-76074 was never found. An 8-month partial remission was reported in one previously untreated patient with hepatocellular carcinoma at 40 microgram/m2. The MTD was fixed at 40 microgram/m2 daily; 35 and 30 microgram/m2 are the daily doses recommended for Phase II studies in good- and poor-risk patients. The daily regimen for 5 days seems to offer no advantage over the single intermittent schedule that has been selected for the Phase II program in Europe.","['Wolff, I', 'Bench, K', 'Beijnen, J H', 'Bruntsch, U', 'Cavalli, F', 'de Jong, J', 'Groot, Y', 'van Tellingen, O', 'Wanders, J', 'Sessa, C']","['Wolff I', 'Bench K', 'Beijnen JH', 'Bruntsch U', 'Cavalli F', 'de Jong J', 'Groot Y', 'van Tellingen O', 'Wanders J', 'Sessa C']","['5 Medical Department, Nuremberg 90419, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Clinical Trial, Phase I', 'Journal Article']",United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzofurans)', '0 (Duocarmycins)', '0 (Indoles)', '668UF07O1P (carzelesin)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/adverse effects/*pharmacokinetics', 'Area Under Curve', 'Benzofurans/adverse effects/chemistry/*pharmacokinetics', 'Bronchial Spasm/chemically induced', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Duocarmycins', 'Female', 'Flushing/chemically induced', 'Humans', 'Hypersensitivity/etiology', 'Indoles/adverse effects/chemistry/*pharmacokinetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Nausea/chemically induced', 'Neoplasms/*drug therapy', 'Neutropenia/chemically induced', 'Tachycardia/chemically induced', 'Thrombocytopenia/chemically induced', 'Treatment Outcome']",1996/10/01 00:00,1998/11/17 00:01,['1996/10/01 00:00'],"['1996/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/11/17 00:01 [medline]', '1996/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 1996 Oct;2(10):1717-23.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It remains as an important drug for the treatment of children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Aminopterin (AMT) was the initial antifolate showing promise as an anticancer drug. It is more potent than MTX and also is known to be accumulated more efficiently than MTX in model systems. Because Whitehead et al. (Blood, 76: 44-49, 1990) have shown that MTX accumulation by blasts at diagnosis is of prognostic significance in children with ALL, we reasoned that if accumulation of a ""stoichiometric inhibitor"" of dihydrofolate reductase by leukemic blasts was of prognostic importance, then whether it was AMT or MTX may be relevant only with respect to the absolute dose. To compare MTX and AMT metabolism, we incubated lymphoblasts with 1 microM radiolabeled drug in vitro. MTX and AMT accumulation by ALL cells (n = 24) was 0.7 +/- 0.7 and 1.47 +/- 0.9 pmol/10(6) cells, respectively. Based on the data of Whitehead et al., this predicts pharmacological success in 59 and 84% of the MTX and AMT groups, respectively. Moreover, 5 of 10 patients considered poor risks based on MTX accumulation would be ""cures"" based on AMT uptake. Even at only 0.1 microM AMT, a concentration at which there is little accumulation of MTX, 5 of 11 patients studied would be ""pharmacological cures"" based on AMT uptake. Accumulation of AMT by blasts from 11 patients with T-cell-lineage ALL and 5 patients with acute myelogenous leukemia was also found to be twice the uptake of MTX. These data allow the suggestion that AMT, despite increased potential for toxicity, may be useful in children who are identified as poor risks with respect to MTX uptake.","['Smith, A', 'Hum, M', 'Winick, N J', 'Kamen, B A']","['Smith A', 'Hum M', 'Winick NJ', 'Kamen BA']","['Departments of Pediatrics and Pharmacology, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, Texas 75235-9063, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,"['0 (Folic Acid Antagonists)', 'JYB41CTM2Q (Aminopterin)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Aminopterin/pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Child', 'Folic Acid Antagonists/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy', 'Methotrexate/pharmacokinetics', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy']",1996/01/01 00:00,1998/11/17 00:01,['1996/01/01 00:00'],"['1996/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/11/17 00:01 [medline]', '1996/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 1996 Jan;2(1):69-73.,['UO1 CA60431/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

WAF1/Cip1 expression can be activated through p53-dependent and p53-independent pathways. The WAF1/Cip1 protein binds to cyclin-dependent kinase complexes and inhibits the kinase activity that is required for cell cycle progression. In this preliminary study, we analyzed with Western blot assays the steady-state levels of the WAF1/Cip1 protein in the leukemia cells of 100 untreated acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) patients. Normal bone marrow cells from six donors were used as a control. The results of these analyses showed that the levels of the WAF1/Cip1 protein were very low in normal marrow cells and in the leukemia cells of 83 AML patients. High levels of WAF1/Cip1 were detected in 17 patients; these patients with high WAF1/Cip1 levels were significantly less likely to achieve complete remission (41% versus 69%, P = 0.03) and were four times as likely to be resistant to therapy (47% versus 12%, P = 0.003) as patients with very low levels of WAF1/Cip1. Median survival was 38 weeks for patients having very low expression levels versus 11 weeks for patients having high expression levels (P = 0.04). The WAF1/Cip1 level was an independent predictor for response but not survival in a stepwise multivariate regression analysis. Southern blotting analyses did not detect deletion of the WAF1/Cip1 gene in the 12 negative WAF1/Cip1 AML samples tested. Also, the level of WAF1/Cip1 protein expression was not correlated with overexpression of cyclin D1, cyclin E, proliferating cell nuclear antigen, cyclin-dependent kinase 4, or p53 in the leukemia cells. However, the levels of cyclin D1, cyclin E, and cyclin-dependent kinase 4 were elevated in most of the AML samples compared with that in normal marrow. We hypothesize that high-level constitutively expressed WAF1/Cip1 in tumor cells may result in an indolent state that is refractory to chemotherapy drugs. We conclude that the WAF1/Cip1 expression level may be an important prognostic factor for response to therapy and survival in AML patients.","['Zhang, W', 'Kornblau, S M', 'Kobayashi, T', 'Gambel, A', 'Claxton, D', 'Deisseroth, A B']","['Zhang W', 'Kornblau SM', 'Kobayashi T', 'Gambel A', 'Claxton D', 'Deisseroth AB']","['Departments of Neuro-Oncology, The University of Texas M.

However, searches for in vivo evidence of nucleosomal DNA fragmentation in leukemia cells freshly obtained from patients during chemotherapy frequently failed to reveal nucleosomal multimers (DNA ladders). It is not clear whether this type of DNA cleavage is an essential event in drug-induced apoptosis and thus a denominator of cell killing, or whether the internucleosomal DNA fragments are merely the by-products of the apoptotic process. Here, we report our investigation into the role of DNA fragmentation in apoptotic cell death induced by anticancer nucleoside analogues, both in cell culture and in leukemia patients undergoing chemotherapy. Using a 5'-end DNA-labeling technique and pulsed field gel electrophoresis, we detected fragmentation of DNA in two distinct size classes, internucleosomal and high molecular weight (predominantly 50 kb) DNA fragments, in a human leukemia cell line exposed to the nucleoside analogues fludarabine and gemcitabine. We further demonstrated that the two types of DNA fragmentation were separate events, distinguishable by their requirements for Ca2+ and responses to phorbol ester treatment. The drug-treated cells underwent morphological changes of apoptosis even after internucleosomal DNA fragmentation was selectively inhibited by intracellular Ca2+ chelation, or by treatment with phorbol ester. In contrast, neither apoptotic morphology nor internucleosomal DNA fragmentation was observed when the high molecular weight DNA fragmentation was blocked by inhibition of nucleoside analogue incorporation into DNA. These results suggest that cleavage of DNA into large fragments may be an initial event that is critical for drug-induced apoptosis, whereas activation of a Ca2+-dependent endonuclease to cleave DNA at internucleosomal sites is not an absolute requirement for the execution of the apoptotic cell death program. Further studies of leukemic lymphocytes obtained from 9 patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia during therapy with fludarabine revealed high molecular weight DNA fragmentation, which was correlated with a decrease of peripheral lymphocytes in 6 patients, whereas only 1 of the 15 patients evaluated for nucleosomal DNA fragments showed the DNA ladders. These results indicate that high molecular weight DNA fragmentation occurs in vivo, and may be correlated with the cytotoxic action of the anticancer drugs. Further study of the association of high molecular weight DNA fragmentation with clinical response to chemotherapy is warranted.","['Huang, P', 'Robertson, L E', 'Wright, S', 'Plunkett, W']","['Huang P', 'Robertson LE', 'Wright S', 'Plunkett W']","['Departments of Clinical Investigation and Hematology, The University of Texas M.

MAb PM-81, also referred to as MDX-11, is capable of activating human and rabbit complement and lysing CD15-positive AML cells. In this Phase I study, patients were treated with 0.5, 1.0, or 1.5 mg/kg MDX-11 delivered over a 24-h period followed by conventional chemotherapy. Transient decreases in circulating blast cells postinfusion (prior to chemotherapy) were observed at all doses. We were able to show MDX-11 binding to bone marrow blasts in those patients who achieved stable serum levels of MDX-11. Serum MDX-11 was detectable at the 1. 0- and 1.5-mg/kg doses. Doses of 0.5 and 1.0 mg/kg were generally well tolerated, with no toxicities greater than grade II (Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group) reported. However, two of five patients receiving the 1.5-mg/kg dose experienced grade IV toxicities that resolved with treatment (one of these patients completed the infusion).

The aim of this study was to examine the cell cycle position-related changes in expression of p53, as well as induction of apoptosis, in mitogen-stimulated normal human lymphocytes and in human leukemic MOLT-4 cells (which express mutated p53), following DNA damage by the alkylating agent nitrogen mustard. Measurement of p53 expression and DNA content by flow cytometry followed by bivariate analysis of the data made it possible to correlate the drug-induced changes in p53 expression in individual cells with their cell cycle position without the need for cell synchronization. Expression of p53 was detected immunocytochemically using the AB-6 mAb, which reacts with the product of the wild-type p53 tumor suppressor gene and with most of its mutated forms. Exposure of normal lymphocytes to 5 microM nitrogen mustard caused their arrest in G1, an increase in p53 expression which was maximal in such cells, and significant apoptosis in cells located beyond the arrest point (S and G2 + M cells). In contrast, neither arrest in G1 nor significant apoptosis of MOLT-4 cells was seen after administration of either 0.5 or 5 microM nitrogen mustard for up to 24 h, although the drug reduced the rate of cell progression in the S-phase at both concentrations. Expression of p53 was highest for S and G2 + M MOLT-4 cells in response to the nitrogen mustard. Although a severalfold lower level of p53 was detected in lymphocytes compared to MOLT-4 cells prior to drug treatment, the relative increase in p53 expression in response to the drug was 2-fold higher in lymphocytes. These data suggest that DNA damage caused by nitrogen mustard provides a signal that results in stabilization of wild-type p53, preferentially in G1 cells, causes cell arrest in G1, and induces apoptosis of the cells that either were in the S-phase at the time of drug administration and/or escaped G1 arrest. The increase in expression of mutated p53, in response to DNA damage, is unrelated to the cell cycle position, and neither provides a signal for cell arrest in G1 nor a trigger for immediate apoptosis.","['Bhatia, U', 'Danishefsky, K', 'Traganos, F', 'Darzynkiewicz, Z']","['Bhatia U', 'Danishefsky K', 'Traganos F', 'Darzynkiewicz Z']","['The Cancer Research Institute, Department of Pathology, New York Medical College, Valhalla, New York 10595, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,"['0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '50D9XSG0VR (Mechlorethamine)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Cell Cycle/*drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'DNA Damage', 'G1 Phase', 'G2 Phase', 'Genes, p53/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Lymphocytes/cytology/*drug effects/physiology', 'Mechlorethamine/*toxicity', 'Mitosis', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma', 'S Phase', 'Transcription, Genetic/drug effects', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/*genetics']",1995/08/01 00:00,1998/11/17 00:01,['1995/08/01 00:00'],"['1995/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/11/17 00:01 [medline]', '1995/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 1995 Aug;1(8):873-80.,['CA 28704/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We compared their effect to the effect of IFN-alpha. Norsegoline, dibezine, and IFN-alpha inhibited the proliferation of CFU-C in a dose-dependent manner. The number of CFU-C from bone marrow (BM) of five CML patients in chronic phase exposed for 16 h to norsegoline (10(-8)-10(-6)M), dibezine (10(-8)-10(-6)M), and IFN-alpha (500 units/ml) was found to be statistically lower (P < 0.05) than the number of CFU-C derived from normal individuals. A 16-h drug exposure of CD34(+) cells isolated from the peripheral blood of three CML patients in blastic crisis and from BM of two patients in chronic phase resulted in a marked inhibition in the ability of the cells to proliferate in liquid culture and a reduction in CFU-C content. Using the fluorescent in situ hybridization technique, we evaluated detection of the BCR/ABL fusion product in the CD34(+) cells. All five patients were 100% Philadelphia positive at diagnosis. BCR/ABL translocations were detected in 94.6 +/- 0.6% of cells following their growth in liquid culture for 7 days. Following exposure of CD34(+) cells to norsegoline, dibezine, or IFN-alpha, BCR/ABL fusion signals could be detected in 73 +/- 11%, 66.5 +/- 4. 7%, and 66.0 +/- 2.5% of cells from BM and 72.3 +/- 5%, 68.8 +/- 7%, and 60.6 +/- 6.8% of peripheral blood, respectively.

The drug had demonstrated significant activity in preclinical studies and some activity in Phase I trials. The drug is extensively metabolized and detected in plasma and urine. Its toxicity has previously been correlated to the formation of an active metabolite, N-acetyl-amonafide. Amonafide was chosen for inclusion in the Cancer and Leukemia Group B (CALGB) master metastatic breast cancer protocol. CALGB 8642 randomizes previously untreated metastatic breast cancer patients either to one of several Phase II agents given for up to four cycles and then followed by standard cyclophosphamide-doxorubicin-5-fluorouracil, or to immediate treatment with standard cyclophosphamide-doxorubicin-5-fluorouracil. The end point of CALGB 8642 is to assess the difference in survival, toxicity, and overall response when limited exposure to Phase II agents precedes standard chemotherapy. This report deals only with amonafide as a Phase II agent. Comparisons with the cyclophosphamide-doxorubicin-5-fluorouracil arm will not be addressed. Patients had to have histologically documented measurable breast cancer and a performance status of 0-1. Patients could not have had prior chemotherapy for metastatic disease. Prior adjuvant chemotherapy was permitted. Patients could not have visceral crisis. Amonafide was given at 300 mg/m2/day i.v. for 5 days, and repeated at 21-day intervals for a maximum of four cycles. Escalation and reduction in dose was mandated dependent on hematotoxicity or lack thereof. Toxicity was primarily hematological and bimodal: 32% had grade 3 or 4 leukopenia and 24% had grade 3 or 4 thrombocytopenia; 22% had no leukopenia and 44% had no thrombocytopenia. The response rate was 18%, including one complete response. When response was analyzed by hematological toxicity, there was a 35.7% response if patients had leukopenia grade 3/4 (versus 8.3%, P = 0.08). There was a 50% response if patients had thrombocytopenia grade 3/4 (versus 7.1%, P = <0.01). We conclude that amonafide is somewhat active in previously untreated breast cancer patients. There may be a steep dose-response curve, based on the significant correlation between myelosuppression and response. Rates of responses in patients adequately dosed (i.e., with significant hematotoxicity) with amonafide ranged from 35 to 50%. Further studies will incorporate individualized dosing based on pretreatment acetylator phenotyping.","['Costanza, M E', 'Berry, D', 'Henderson, I C', 'Ratain, M J', 'Wu, K', 'Shapiro, C', 'Duggan, D', 'Kalra, J', 'Berkowitz, I', 'Lyss, A P']","['Costanza ME', 'Berry D', 'Henderson IC', 'Ratain MJ', 'Wu K', 'Shapiro C', 'Duggan D', 'Kalra J', 'Berkowitz I', 'Lyss AP']","['Central Massachusetts Oncology Group, Worcester, Massachusetts 01655, USA.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Clinical Trial, Phase II', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,"['0 (Imides)', '0 (Isoquinolines)', '0 (Naphthalimides)', '0 (Organophosphonates)', '0 (Receptors, Estrogen)', '1Q8D39N37L (amonafide)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'JAC85A2161 (Adenine)', 'U3P01618RT (Fluorouracil)']",IM,"['Adenine', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Breast Neoplasms/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Cyclophosphamide/administration & dosage', 'Doxorubicin/administration & dosage', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Female', 'Fluorouracil/administration & dosage', 'Humans', 'Imides/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Isoquinolines/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Menopause', 'Middle Aged', 'Naphthalimides', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Organophosphonates', 'Receptors, Estrogen/analysis']",1995/07/01 00:00,1998/11/17 00:01,['1995/07/01 00:00'],"['1995/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/11/17 00:01 [medline]', '1995/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 1995 Jul;1(7):699-704.,"['CA33601/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA41287/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA60138/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This translocation is often the only visible karyotypic aberration present which is detected in almost 100% of acute promyelocytic leukemia patients. As an initial step to study the role of PML/RARalpha in leukemogenesis, we attempted to express the fusion protein in hematopoietic cells through retrovirus-mediated gene transfer of the retroviral vector, pGPRCHT, which contains the PML/RARalpha cDNA. Transduction of the PML/RARalpha cDNA fragment used in this vector, which extends from the position 31 bp to the position 2638 bp in a transcription unit driven by the Moloney murine sarcoma virus LTR, was found to abrogate the growth factor dependence of TF-1 cells. In addition, introduction of PML/RARalpha into TF-1 cells can protect these cells from the apoptosis usually induced in TF-1 cells by growth factor withdrawal, as measured by three assays for apoptosis: morphology, DNA ladder formation, and end labeling of nicked DNA with fluorescent-conjugated nucleotide precursors followed by a fluorescence-activated cell sorting assay. These data suggest that the PML/RARalpha fusion protein may inhibit programmed cell death in myeloid cells.","['Fu, S', 'Consoli, U', 'Hanania, E G', 'Zu, Z', 'Claxton, D F', 'Andreeff, M', 'Deisseroth, A B']","['Fu S', 'Consoli U', 'Hanania EG', 'Zu Z', 'Claxton DF', 'Andreeff M', 'Deisseroth AB']","['Department of Hematology, The University of Texas M.

This has led to the impression that the induction of c-jun expression may be directly involved in the molecular signaling of the final common pathway of programmed cell death or apoptosis. In the present study, we examined the role of c-jun expression in three different settings of anticancer drug-induced apoptosis in human leukemic cells. First, exposure of human myeloid leukemia HL-60 cells to high-dose ara-C for 4 h produced internucleosomal DNA fragmentation preceded by c-jun induction. However, pretreatment of HL-60 cells with staurosporine, a protein kinase C inhibitor, repressed c-jun yet enhanced DNA fragmentation and apoptosis due to ara-C. Second, in human pre-B leukemia 697/BCL-2 cells which are transfected with the cDNA of the bcl-2 oncogene and overexpress p26BCL-2, although ara-C or mitoxantrone treatment caused greater c-jun induction than in the 697/neo cells, significantly reduced endonucleolytic DNA fragmentation and apoptosis was observed in 697/BCL-2 cells. Finally, taxol-induced internucleosomal DNA fragmentation and morphological features of apoptosis in HL-60 cells were not associated with the induction of c-jun expression. These lines of evidence indicate that the induction of c-jun expression may not have a direct role in the molecular signaling of anticancer drug-induced apoptosis, and that the anticancer drug-induced apoptosis can occur by a mechanism that does not involve the induction of c-jun expression.","['Bullock, G', 'Ray, S', 'Reed, J', 'Miyashita, T', 'Maria Ibrado, A', 'Huang, Y', 'Bhalla, K']","['Bullock G', 'Ray S', 'Reed J', 'Miyashita T', 'Maria Ibrado A', 'Huang Y', 'Bhalla K']","['Division of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Medicine, Medical University of South Carolina, Charleston, South Carolina 29425, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-jun)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', 'BZ114NVM5P (Mitoxantrone)', 'P88XT4IS4D (Paclitaxel)', 'Q20Q21Q62J (Cisplatin)', 'XT3Z54Z28A (Camptothecin)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects/*physiology', 'Camptothecin/toxicity', 'Cisplatin/toxicity', 'Cytarabine/toxicity', 'Etoposide/toxicity', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/*drug effects', 'Genes, bcl-2', '*Genes, jun', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, B-Cell', 'Mitoxantrone/toxicity', 'Paclitaxel/toxicity', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-jun/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Recombinant Proteins/biosynthesis', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1995/05/01 00:00,1998/11/17 00:01,['1995/05/01 00:00'],"['1995/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/11/17 00:01 [medline]', '1995/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 1995 May;1(5):559-64.,"['CA56613/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA63382/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have attempted to address this problem by studying the cellular pharmacology of tritiated suramin ([3H]suramin) in the DU145 and LNCaP prostate cancer cell lines, as well as in HL60 cells, an acute promyelocytic leukemia cell line. In the cell lines studied, significant, multisite, trypsin-insensitive, low-affinity cell surface binding by [3H]suramin was observed (Bmax > 10(6), Kd > 1 microM). The binding of [3H]suramin to the cell surface was competitive with respect to a phosphorothioate oligodeoxynucleotide homopolymer of cytidine, 28 bases in length, but was not affected by ATP. Use of this competitor allowed us to determine that [3H]suramin bound to the surface of HL60 cells was internalized via the process of adsorptive endocytosis and was maximal at approximately 6 h. In contrast, binding of suramin to the surface of the prostate cells, but not to that of HL60 cells, was completely abrogated by the presence of albumin (DU145 and LNCaP cells), or by warming to 37 degreesC (DU145 cells only). The dynamics of internalization and compartmentalization of suramin in DU145 revealed that within a narrow concentration range, internalization was dependent on time of exposure and drug concentration. Analysis of the exocytosis of suramin from DU145 cells revealed that approximately 64% of the drug was effluxed from a shallow compartment (t1/2 = 3.15 min) and 31% from a deep compartment (t1/2 = 433 min); both compartments probably represent endosomes. The results suggest that, because of the complexities of suramin's cellular pharmacology, its mechanism of action may vary signficantly according to cell type.","['Stein, C A', 'Khan, T M', 'Khaled, Z', 'Tonkinson, J L']","['Stein CA', 'Khan TM', 'Khaled Z', 'Tonkinson JL']","['Department of Medicine, Columbia University, College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, New York 10032, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Oligodeoxyribonucleotides)', '0 (Thionucleotides)', '0 (oligodeoxycytidylic acid)', '10028-17-8 (Tritium)', '6032D45BEM (Suramin)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacokinetics', 'Binding, Competitive', 'Cell Membrane/*metabolism', 'Exocytosis', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Male', 'Oligodeoxyribonucleotides/pharmacology', 'Prostatic Neoplasms', 'Suramin/*pharmacokinetics', 'Temperature', 'Thionucleotides', 'Tritium']",1995/05/01 00:00,1998/11/17 00:01,['1995/05/01 00:00'],"['1995/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/11/17 00:01 [medline]', '1995/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 1995 May;1(5):509-17.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Detection of these submicroscopic rearrangements can be accomplished easily using Southern blot and PCR technology and may have potential value for monitoring disease during and following treatment. The incidence of TAL1 gene rearrangements in adults with ALL is unknown. In this pilot study, we performed Southern blot and PCR analysis in a group of newly diagnosed adult ALL patients to determine the incidence of TAL1 rearrangements. Thirty-three adults with T cell ALL were studied; of these, one patient had a t(1;14)(p34;q11) and molecular rearrangement of TAL1.

Cross-resistance studies showed that while the variant lines generally retained sensitivities to 9-beta-D-arabinofuranosyladenine (in the presence of 2'-deoxycoformycin), hydroxyurea, and Adriamycin, both were highly cross-resistant to 1-beta-D-arabinofuranosylcytosine (ara-C), 2', 2'-difluorodeoxycytidine, and 9-beta-D-arabinofuranosyl-2-fluoroadenine. Measurement of both phosphorylating and degrading enzyme activities demonstrated that initial phosphorylation of CldAdo and 2'-deoxycytidine were severely impaired in cell extracts from the resistant lines, whereas adenosine kinase activity remained unaffected and there was no apparent increase in cytoplasmic deoxynucleotidase activity using dCMP as substrate. Since previous reports indicated that either overexpression of Bcl-2 protein following bcl-2 transfection into cells resulted in, or high dCTP pools contributed to, ara-C resistance in experimental cell models, both of these parameters were assessed and found not to contribute to CldAdo resistance in the murine leukemia and human B lymphoblastoid cells. These studies show that a deficiency of 2'-deoxycytidine kinase activity is a major determinant of CldAdo acquired resistance in both the murine and human lymphoid lines.","['Orr', 'Talbot', 'Aherne', 'Fisher', 'Serafinowski', 'Harrap']","['Orr RM', 'Talbot DC', 'Aherne WG', 'Fisher TC', 'Serafinowski P', 'Harrap KR']","['Cancer Research Campaign Centre for Cancer Therapeutics, The Institute of Cancer Research, Sutton, Surrey SM2 5NG, and Cancer Research Campaign Molecular and Cellular Pharmacology Group, School of Biological Sciences, University of Manchest.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,,,,1995/04/01 00:00,1998/11/17 00:00,['1995/04/01 00:00'],"['1995/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/11/17 00:00 [medline]', '1995/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 1995 Apr;1(4):391-8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Its intracellular nucleotides, in particular the 5'-triphosphate, are thought to be the pharmacologically active metabolites. The present study was undertaken to elucidate the cellular pharmacokinetics of these active metabolites in leukemia patients during CdA treatment. The concentrations of CdA in plasma and of CdA nucleotides (CdAN) in leukemic cells were measured by liquid chromatography in 69 patients with chronic lymphocytic, acute myeloid, and hairy cell leukemia after intermittent and continuous i.v. infusion, s.c. injection, and p.o. administration. The t1/2 of CdAN during the first dose interval was 13.8 h (n = 67), while after the last dose the t1/2 was 32.7 h (n =8). The area under the concentration versus time curve was similar after intermittent and continuous infusion, 268.3 and 237.8 &mgr;m/h, respectively (n = 7). The area under the concentration versus time curve after p.o. administration (0.24 mg/kg) was slightly lower than that after intermittent infusion (0.12 mg/kg), 120.6 versus 188.8 &mgr;m/h (P < 0.05, n = 7). However, when all p.o. administrations (n = 16) were compared with all 2-h infusions in other patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (n = 32), there was no significant difference (149.6 versus 168.6 &mgr;m/h). The cellular concentration of CdAN was 320 times higher than the plasma concentration of CdA, but there was no correlation in individual patients (r2 = 0.02, n =69). The t1/2 of CdAN was significantly shorter in patients with acute leukemias (9 h) compared to those with chronic lymphocytic (12.9 h) and hairy cell leukemias (15.1 h). The area under the concentration versus time curve of CdAN in leukemic cells from the 11 patients with hairy cell leukemia given CdA s.c. was in the same range (179.8 &mgr;m/h) as in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia. The retention of CdAN in leukemic cells supports intermittent administration. The lack of correlation between cellular and plasma drug concentrations indicates that plasma drug concentrations are not useful for individualization of dose.","['Liliemark', 'Juliusson']","['Liliemark J', 'Juliusson G']","['Departments of Clinical Pharmacology and Oncology, Karolinska Hospital, S-104 01 Stockholm, and Division of Clinical Hematology and Oncology, Department of Medicine, Huddinge Hospital, Huddinge, Sweden.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,,,,1995/04/01 00:00,1998/11/17 00:00,['1995/04/01 00:00'],"['1995/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/11/17 00:00 [medline]', '1995/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 1995 Apr;1(4):385-90.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To test the hypothesis that this heterogeneity is a consequence of the pleiotropic effects of growth factors on leukemic cell biology, we measured the effects of in vivo interleukin 3 (IL-3) administration on leukemic cell proliferation and drug sensitivity. Thirty-four patients with acute myeloid leukemia with high-risk features or advanced myelodysplasia received IL-3 as a continuous infusion beginning 3 days prior to chemotherapy and continuing for the duration of intensive induction therapy. Bone marrow cells were studied prior to and after 3 days of IL-3 administration to assess changes in overall and leukemic progenitor cell [leukemia colony-forming unit (CFU-L)] proliferation, and progenitor cell sensitivity to 1-betad-arabinofuranosylcytosine. The median fold increase in overall leukemic cell proliferation in response to IL-3, assessed as expression of the nuclear antigen Ki67 in 28 patients, was 1.2. The median fold increase in percentage of cells in S phase (assessed in 29 patients) was 1.3. Despite the increase in overall cell proliferation in 70% of cases, CFU-L number increased in only 4 of 20 patients successfully studied (median day 4:day 1 ratio of CFU-L number, 0.6). While this suggests possible terminal differentiation of leukemic progenitor cells, expression of CD34, HLA-DR, c-kit, CD15, and CD14 were not consistently affected by the cytokine. 1-betad-Arabinofuranosylcytosine sensitivity of CFU-L increased significantly in 30% of cases, decreased in 30%, and was unchanged in 40%. Changes in overall cell proliferation (Ki67 expression) and CFU-L were independent predictors of change in 1-beta-d-arabinofuranosylcytosine sensitivity; increase in percentage of cells in S phase in response to IL-3 was correlated with attainment of complete remission. While these findings support the concept of cell cycle recruitment, IL-3 has marked pleiotropic effects on proliferation, differentiation, and survival of leukemic progenitors which make the clinical impact of in vivo cytokine administration for individual patients difficult to predict.","['Gore, S D', 'Weng, L J', 'Jones, R J', 'Cowan, K', 'Zilcha, M', 'Piantadosi, S', 'Burke, P J']","['Gore SD', 'Weng LJ', 'Jones RJ', 'Cowan K', 'Zilcha M', 'Piantadosi S', 'Burke PJ']","['The Johns Hopkins Oncology Center, Oncology 2-109, Baltimore, Maryland 21287-8963, USA.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Interleukin-3)', '0 (Ki-67 Antigen)', '0 (Receptors, Growth Factor)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Bone Marrow/immunology/pathology', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage', 'Daunorubicin/administration & dosage', 'Etoposide/administration & dosage', 'Female', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/immunology/pathology', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Infusions, Intravenous', 'Interleukin-3/*therapeutic use', 'Ki-67 Antigen/analysis', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/drug therapy/pathology/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/drug therapy/pathology/*therapy', 'Receptors, Growth Factor/analysis/genetics', 'Remission Induction']",1995/03/01 00:00,1998/11/17 00:01,['1995/03/01 00:00'],"['1995/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/11/17 00:01 [medline]', '1995/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 1995 Mar;1(3):295-303.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To test whether G-CSF infusion prior to ara-C infusion would biologically modulate the accumulation of ara-9-beta-D-arabinofuranosylcytosine 5'-triphosphate (ara-CTP) and other ara nucleotides in the leukemia blasts during therapy, protocols were designed to infuse G-CSF prior to fludarabine (9-beta-D-arabinofuranosyl-2-fluoroadenine monophosphate) and ara-C to increase the accumulation of the active triphosphates [9-beta-D-arabinofuranosyl-2-fluoroadenine 5'-triphosphate (F-ara-ATP) and ara-CTP] in acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) blasts during therapy. To complement these in vivo studies, ex vivo accumulation of ara-CTP was also investigated before and after G-CSF infusion. Patients (n = 5) treated on the fludarabine/ara-C/G-CSF regimen received a 30 mg/m2 dose of fludarabine followed by a 2 g/m2 dose of ara-C infused i.v. for 4 h. Beginning at 24 h, and every day, patients received a 6-h infusion of 400 microgram/m2 G-CSF. At 48 h, the fludarabine and ara-C couplet was repeated. Comparison of F-ara-ATP pharmacokinetics in circulating AML cells of patients on the fludarabine/ara- C/G-CSF regimen demonstrated that the area under concentration time curve (AUC) of F-ara-ATP increased significantly (median, 1.4-fold; range, 0.9-1.5; P = 0.045) after G-CSF infusion. This was due to an increased rate of F-ara-ATP accumulation by AML cells. The AUC of ara-CTP, on the other hand, was not affected (median, 1.0-fold; range, 1.0-1.2; P = 0.571) after G-CSF infusion. Because fludarabine potentiates the accumulation of ara-CTP, the effect of G-CSF on ara-CTP metabolism may not be evident in the AML blasts of patients on the fludarabine/ara-C/G-CSF regimen. To determine the effect of G-CSF when ara-C was infused alone, four additional patients were treated on a pilot protocol in which ara-C (2 g/m2) was infused on days 1 and 3 and G-CSF on day 2. The AUC of ara-CTP accumulation in these patients decreased by a median of 48% after G-CSF infusion. Consistent with these in vivo investigations, ex vivo ara-CTP accumulation was decreased in the AML blasts after G-CSF infusion. Based on these data it could be concluded that (a) infusion of G-CSF before fludarabine augmented the rate of F-ara-ATP synthesis in circulating AML blasts during therapy, suggesting that G-CSF may benefit fludarabine therapy by biological modulation; (b) G-CSF did not increase ara-CTP accumulation, rather it may have caused it to decrease; and (c) these data imply that when G-CSF and ara-C are used in combination, administration of fludarabine prior to ara-C may maintain the ara-CTP AUC.","['Gandhi, V', 'Estey, E', 'Du, M', 'Nowak, B', 'Keating, M J', 'Plunkett, W']","['Gandhi V', 'Estey E', 'Du M', 'Nowak B', 'Keating MJ', 'Plunkett W']","['Departments of Clinical Investigation and Hematology, The University of Texas, Houston, Texas 77030, USA.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,"['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'P2K93U8740 (fludarabine)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use', 'Biotransformation', 'Blast Crisis/blood/drug therapy/pathology', 'Cell Cycle', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage/*pharmacokinetics', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Infusions, Intravenous', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*blood/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Pilot Projects', 'Vidarabine/administration & dosage/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacokinetics']",1995/02/01 00:00,1998/11/17 00:01,['1995/02/01 00:00'],"['1995/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/11/17 00:01 [medline]', '1995/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 1995 Feb;1(2):169-78.,"['CA32839/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA55164/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA57629/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recent studies have also shown that Taxol-induced apoptosis, but not Taxol-induced microtubular bundling or mitotic arrest, is significantly inhibited in cells that overexpress the bcl-2 gene product p26BCL-2. In the present studies we examined the effects of several modulators of activities of protein kinases on Taxol-induced DNA fragmentation and apoptosis in human pre-B leukemia 697 cells transfected with the cDNA of the bcl-2 gene and expressing high intracellular levels of p26BCL-2 (697/BCL-2 cells). Treatment with 0.1-1.0 microM MTaxol for 24 h produced prolonged mitotic arrest of control 697/neo cells, which had been transfected with the neomycin resistance gene. This resulted in apoptosis-associated large DNA fragments ranging between 5 and 200 kb and internucleosomal DNA fragmentation. Cotreatment with the phorbol ester phorbol dibutyrate (PdBU) significantly reduced Taxol-induced internucleosomal and large DNA fragmentation and inhibited apoptosis of 697/neo cells. In contrast, a combined exposure to Taxol and staurosporine (ST; 5 or 50 ng/ml), a potent inhibitor of protein kinase C and other kinases, significantly increased DNA fragmentation and apoptosis of 697/neo cells. Additionally, in 697/BCL-2 cells, ST partially overcame the suppressive effects of high p26BCL-2 levels on Taxol-induced apoptosis. Cotreatment with the tyrosine kinase inhibitor Genistein (30 microM) markedly inhibited Taxol-induced DNA fragmentation and apoptosis of 697/neo cells. However, it is noteworthy that the modulations of Taxol-induced DNA fragmentation and apoptosis by PdBU, ST, and Genistein occurred without significant effects on Taxol-mediated mitotic arrest of 697/neo cells. These agents also did not affect intracellular p26BCL-2 levels in 697/neo or 697/BCL-2 cells. These findings indicate that Taxol-induced apoptosis can be modulated by agents that affect the activities of protein kinases, and these effects are not mediated by modulations of Taxol-induced mitotic arrest or by alterations of intracellular p26BCL-2 levels.","['Ponnathpur, V', 'Ibrado, A M', 'Reed, J C', 'Ray, S', 'Huang, Y', 'Self, S', 'Bullock, G', 'Nawabi, A', 'Bhalla, K']","['Ponnathpur V', 'Ibrado AM', 'Reed JC', 'Ray S', 'Huang Y', 'Self S', 'Bullock G', 'Nawabi A', 'Bhalla K']","['Division of Hematology/Oncology, Departments of Medicine and Pathology, Medical University of South Carolina, Charleston, South Carolina 29425, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Carcinogens)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '37558-16-0 (Phorbol 12,13-Dibutyrate)', 'DH2M523P0H (Genistein)', 'H88EPA0A3N (Staurosporine)', 'P88XT4IS4D (Paclitaxel)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects/genetics', 'Carcinogens/pharmacology', 'DNA Fragmentation/drug effects', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'G2 Phase/drug effects', 'Genistein/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*metabolism', 'Paclitaxel/*pharmacology', 'Phorbol 12,13-Dibutyrate/pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*metabolism', 'S Phase/drug effects', 'Staurosporine/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects']",1995/11/01 00:00,1998/11/17 00:01,['1995/11/01 00:00'],"['1995/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/11/17 00:01 [medline]', '1995/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 1995 Nov;1(11):1399-406.,['CA63382-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The tumor transplanted into the mice induced severe body weight loss (30% of body weight) when the tumor weight was only 1 g. In addition, other indicators for cachexia, such as adipose tissue and muscle wasting and hypoglycemia, were also observed in the tumor-bearing mice, suggesting that this is a proper model for experimental cachexia induced by a human tumor. We then examined the association of this model with various cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor alpha, interleukin (IL)-1alpha, IL-1beta, IFN-gamma, IL-6, and leukemia inhibitory factor, and identified human IL-6, which was produced by the tumor cells, as a mediator of cachexia. A neutralizing antibody against hIL-6 administered to the mice after the development of cachexia symptoms significantly improved body weight loss, adipose tissue wasting, hypoglycemia, acute phase reaction, and leukocytosis, although it did not suppress the tumor growth. These results demonstrate that the hIL-6 produced by the tumor cells is an essential mediator of the cachexia induction in this model.","['Tamura, S', 'Ouchi, K F', 'Mori, K', 'Endo, M', 'Matsumoto, T', 'Eda, H', 'Tanaka, Y', 'Ishitsuka, H', 'Tokita, H', 'Yamaguchi, K']","['Tamura S', 'Ouchi KF', 'Mori K', 'Endo M', 'Matsumoto T', 'Eda H', 'Tanaka Y', 'Ishitsuka H', 'Tokita H', 'Yamaguchi K']","['Department of Oncology, Nippon Roche Research Center, 200 Kajiwara, Kamakura, Kanagawa 247, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Interleukins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/therapeutic use', 'Cachexia/etiology/*metabolism/therapy', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-6/*metabolism', 'Interleukins/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Nude', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*metabolism', 'Transplantation, Heterologous', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/metabolism', 'Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/complications/metabolism']",1995/11/01 00:00,1998/11/17 00:01,['1995/11/01 00:00'],"['1995/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/11/17 00:01 [medline]', '1995/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 1995 Nov;1(11):1353-8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Several immune trigger molecules have been characterized. Among them, FcgammaRI appears to play an important role in antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity. It is expressed mainly on monocytes, macrophages, and neutrophils under certain clinical situations. The expression of FcgammaRI can be regulated by a variety of cytokines, primarily by IFN-gamma. Recent studies have shown that granulocyte-colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) and granulocyte-macrophage-colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) can increase the number of the FcgammaRI-positive monocytes, increase the expression of FcgammaRI on circulating neutrophils after in vivo infusion, and greatly enhance the cytotoxic activity of circulating neutrophils. CD33 is a glycoprotein expressed on the cell surface of mature monocytes, myeloid progenitor cells, and myeloid leukemic blasts, but not on the earliest hematopoietic progenitor cells and other normal tissues. Herein, we report the construction of a BsAb, 251 x 22, by conjugating an anti-CD33 mAb (mAb 251) to an anti-FcgammaRI mAb (mAb 22). The BsAb 251 x 22 is capable of enhancing the cytotoxicity of several leukemia cell lines by cytokine-activated monocytes. Our data also show that G-CSF- and GM-CSF-stimulated monocytes can mediate cytotoxicity of target leukemia cells comparable to that of IFN-gamma-stimulated monocytes. The expression of FcgammaRI on monocytes after 24-h in vitro incubation with G-CSF and GM-CSF was increased, although not significantly. Prolonged incubation of monocytes with G-CSF for 48 h significantly increased the FcgammaRI expression. Because humanized anti-CD33 and anti-FcgammaRI mAb are available, and because GM-CSF and G-CSF have been used widely for patients after chemotherapy to stimulate the recovery of myeloid hematopoiesis, additional clinical development of this project is feasible. A BsAb comprised of humanized anti-CD33 and anti-FcgammaRI could have clinical application in the treatment of myeloid leukemia, especially in the management of minimal residual disease.","['Chen, J', 'Zhou, J H', 'Ball, E D']","['Chen J', 'Zhou JH', 'Ball ED']","['Division of Hematology/Bone Marrow Transplantation, University of Pittsburgh Medical Center and Pittsburgh Cancer Institute, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania 15213, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,"['0 (Antibodies, Bispecific)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, Myelomonocytic)', '0 (CD33 protein, human)', '0 (Receptors, IgG)', '0 (Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 3)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Antibodies, Bispecific/metabolism/*therapeutic use', 'Antibody-Dependent Cell Cytotoxicity/*immunology', 'Antigens, CD/*immunology/metabolism', 'Antigens, Differentiation, Myelomonocytic/*immunology/metabolism', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/immunology', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/immunology', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy/methods', 'Interferon-gamma/immunology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/immunology/metabolism/*therapy', 'Monocytes, Activated Killer/*immunology', 'Receptors, IgG/*immunology/metabolism', 'Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 3', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1995/11/01 00:00,1998/11/17 00:01,['1995/11/01 00:00'],"['1995/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/11/17 00:01 [medline]', '1995/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 1995 Nov;1(11):1319-25.,['CA31888/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The human cancers analyzed could be divided into three groups with regard to MRP expression. Group 1 consists of tumors that often exhibit high to very high MRP mRNA levels (e.g., chronic lymphocytic leukemia). Group 2 comprises the tumors that often exhibit low, but occasionally exhibit high MRP mRNA expression (e.g., esophagus squamous cell carcinoma, non-small cell lung cancer, and acute myelocytic leukemia). Group 3 comprises the tumors with predominantly low levels of MRP mRNA, comparable to the levels found in normal tissues (e.g., other hematological malignancies, soft tissue sarcomas, melanoma, and cancers of the prostate, breast, kidney, bladder, testis, ovary, and colon). Using the MRP-specific mAbs MRPr1 and MRPm6, we confirmed the elevated MRP mRNA levels in tumor tissues by immunohistochemistry.

However, resistance to chemotherapy also occurs in the absence of Pgp overexpression. Therefore, besides Pgp expression, we have assessed the expression of MRP, a novel drug transporter gene, along with the functional multidrug-resistant (MDR) phenotype of leukemic cells. These MDR parameters are correlated with clinical outcome in individual patients. We found functional changes in fresh leukemic cells from de novo or relapsed patients similar to those reported for tumor cell lines with the MDR phenotype. These changes were reduced drug accumulation as assessed with radiolabeled doxorubicin (factor 1.6), daunomycin (factor 1.13), and vincristine (factor 1.6) in patients who were refractory to the combination treatment of 1-beta-D-arabinofuranosylcytosine (ara-C) and daunomycin or mitoxantrone as opposed to patients who had complete responses. Also, the intracellular distribution of doxorubicin fluorescence (nuclear/cytoplasmic ratio), as assessed with laser scan microscopy, was reduced 1.4-fold in blasts from refractory patients. Based on historically known clinical response to single-agent daunomycin or ara-C in the group of responding de novo AML patients, we have set a threshold level such that a defined part of the samples that had the highest drug accumulation or nuclear to cytoplasmic ratios were above this threshold value. This allowed discrimination between patients responding to daunomycin from those who were refractory to this drug. By using this threshold level, in the refractory group clinical resistance corresponded with high sensitivity with a resistant phenotype. A similar threshold was set for the data of the in vitro ara-C sensitivity test. By combining both assays for all individual patients, clinical refractoriness as well as sensitivity could be predicted with high accuracy. There appeared to be no stringent relationship between the functional MDR phenotype with expression of either Pgp (fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis) or MRP mRNA (RNase protection). However, by combining both parameters the functional MDR phenotype correlated with the overexpression of either one or both of the parameters in 94% of the samples studied. It is concluded that this combined overexpression in conjunction with functional changes for MDR drugs and ara-C reveal a correlation of MDR phenotype with clinical resistance to combination chemotherapy in AML patients and hereby may adequately predict clinical MDR in individual AML patients.","['Schuurhuis, G J', 'Broxterman, H J', 'Ossenkoppele, G J', 'Baak, J P', 'Eekman, C A', 'Kuiper, C M', 'Feller, N', 'van Heijningen, T H', 'Klumper, E', 'Pieters, R']","['Schuurhuis GJ', 'Broxterman HJ', 'Ossenkoppele GJ', 'Baak JP', 'Eekman CA', 'Kuiper CM', 'Feller N', 'van Heijningen TH', 'Klumper E', 'Pieters R', 'et al.']","['Departments of Hematology, Medical Oncology, Pathology, and Pediatrics, Free University Hospital, De Boelelaan 1117, 1081 HV Amsterdam, the Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters)', '0 (Multidrug Resistance-Associated Proteins)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', 'BZ114NVM5P (Mitoxantrone)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/*genetics', 'ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters/*genetics', 'Acute Disease', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Biological Transport', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics/*toxicity', 'Daunorubicin/administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics', 'Doxorubicin/pharmacokinetics', 'Drug Resistance, Multiple/*genetics', 'Etoposide/administration & dosage', 'Humans', 'KB Cells', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*drug therapy/*genetics/pathology', 'Middle Aged', 'Mitoxantrone/administration & dosage', 'Multidrug Resistance-Associated Proteins', 'Phenotype', 'Prognosis', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1995/01/01 00:00,1998/11/17 00:01,['1995/01/01 00:00'],"['1995/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/11/17 00:01 [medline]', '1995/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 1995 Jan;1(1):81-93.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In Phase I studies in patients with relapsed and refractory myelogenous leukemia, HuM195 safely targeted to sites of disease and was nonimmunogenic. HuM195 shows only modest capability of antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) against target HL60 cells and minimal cytolytic activity mediated by human complement. Therefore, efforts were made to enhance ADCC using cytokines. gamma-Interferon, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor did not promote neutrophil-mediated ADCC with HuM195. However, interleukin-2 (IL-2) showed a range of 2-6-fold increases in ADCC against fresh myelogenous leukemia cells and HL60 cells over that seen with HuM195 or low-dose IL-2 alone. ADCC potency was not improved further by the use of homodimeric HuM195. Flow cytometry and Fc receptor-blocking experiments showed that CD16(+) cells were essential for IL-2-enhanced ADCC. As compared to HL60 cells, a multidrug-resistant line of HL60 cells was at least as susceptible to killing by IL-2 or HuM195 or in combination, suggesting that the mechanism of killing may be active against cells surviving and resistant to chemotherapy. Since these in vitro levels of IL-2 and HuM195 can be safely achieved in patients, the enhancement of HuM195 ADCC with low-dose IL-2 is a possible strategy that may be used in vivo to eliminate minimal disease in future trials of patients with myeloid leukemias.","['Caron, P C', 'Lai, L T', 'Scheinberg, D A']","['Caron PC', 'Lai LT', 'Scheinberg DA']","['Department of Medicine, Clinical Immunology and Leukemia Services, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York 10021, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Receptors, Fc)', '0 (Receptors, IgG)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (monoclonal antibody M195)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/*toxicity', 'Antibody-Dependent Cell Cytotoxicity/drug effects/physiology', 'Antigens, CD/physiology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/toxicity', 'Cell Survival/*drug effects', 'Cytokines/*pharmacology', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/pharmacology', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/pharmacology', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Interferon-gamma/pharmacology', 'Interleukin-2/*pharmacology', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/drug therapy/immunology/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Receptors, Fc/physiology', 'Receptors, IgG/physiology', 'Recombinant Proteins/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1995/01/01 00:00,1998/11/17 00:01,['1995/01/01 00:00'],"['1995/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/11/17 00:01 [medline]', '1995/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 1995 Jan;1(1):63-70.,['R01 CA 55349/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Our previous studies during therapy of acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) patients demonstrated that the accumulation of ara-CTP in circulating leukemia blasts was increased by a median of 2-fold when fludarabine (30 mg/m2/day over 30 min) was infused 4 h prior to intermediate dose ara-C. The augmentation was dependent on the cellular concentration of fludarabine triphosphate (F-ara-ATP). To determine the lowest dose of fludarabine needed for modulation of ara-C metabolism, the present study administered fludarabine at a test dose (15 mg/m2 over 30 min) followed by 2 g/m2 ara-C infused over 4 h. The next day, the fludarabine/ara-C couplet was repeated but with a standard dose (30 mg/m2) of fludarabine. There was a dose-dependent accumulation of F-ara-ATP in circulating leukemia blasts; the median peak concentrations were 33 and 41 microM with 15 and 30 mg/m2 of fludarabine, respectively. These intracellular levels of F-ara-ATP effectively increased ara-CTP accumulation to similar levels. To further titrate the dose of fludarabine, the next cohort of patients (n = 4) initially received fludarabine test doses of 7.5 or 5 mg/m2, followed by the 30 mg/m2 dose of fludarabine on the next day; each dose was infused 4 h prior to 2 g/m2 of ara-C. The peak levels of F-ara-ATP at 7.5 and 5 mg/m2 fludarabine were between 3 and 39 microM. The AML blasts that achieved >/=10 microM intracellular F-ara-ATP accumulated ara-CTP similar to the levels achieved after 30 mg/m2 of fludarabine. However, <10 microM intracellular F-ara-ATP resulted in less ara-CTP accumulation compared to that observed after the conventional dose of fludarabine. These data suggest that the modulation of the ara-CTP accumulation by fludarabine is dependent on the cellular concentration of F-ara-ATP, and that 15 mg/m2 fludarabine infused over 30 min consistently produces cellular F-ara-ATP levels that maximize ara-CTP accumulation in AML blasts. These findings point to the feasibility of intensifying the fludarabine-ara-C regimen by using fludarabine as a 15 mg/m2/dose twice daily with intermediate-dose ara-C.","['Gandhi, V', 'Estey, E', 'Du, M', 'Keating, M J', 'Plunkett, W']","['Gandhi V', 'Estey E', 'Du M', 'Keating MJ', 'Plunkett W']","['Departments of Clinical Investigation and Hematology, The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas 77030, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Arabinonucleotides)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '13191-15-6 (Arabinofuranosylcytosine Triphosphate)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '74832-57-8 (2-fluoro-araATP)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'P2K93U8740 (fludarabine)', 'FLAG protocol']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/*administration & dosage/therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Arabinofuranosylcytosine Triphosphate/*metabolism', 'Arabinonucleotides/pharmacokinetics', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage/metabolism', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Female', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/administration & dosage/therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Infusions, Intravenous', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Time Factors', 'Vidarabine/administration & dosage/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use']",1998/11/17 00:00,1998/11/17 00:01,['1998/11/17 00:00'],"['1998/11/17 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/11/17 00:01 [medline]', '1998/11/17 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 1997 Sep;3(9):1539-45.,"['CA32839/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA55164/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA57629/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The IL-6-related cytokines [IL-6, IL-11, oncostatin M (OSM), leukemia inhibitory factor, ciliary neurotrophic factor, and cardiotrophin] often modulate tumor phenotype and control the proliferation of many tumor cell lines. We demonstrate that melanoma cell lines release, in vitro and in vivo (when transplanted in nude mice), soluble gp130 (sgp130), a potential antagonist of cytokines from the IL-6 family. Biochemical analysis revealed that sgp130 derived from melanoma patients' sera or from culture supernatants of melanoma cell lines is a Mr 104,000 protein that resolved after deglycosylation as a Mr 58,000 protein. PCR and Northern blot analysis only identified one gp130 membrane mRNA, suggesting that the soluble form of gp130 is generated by proteolytic cleavage. OSM reproducibly increases sgp130 released by melanoma cell lines, whereas leukemia inhibitory factor stimulates the production of sgp130 in only one of three cell lines tested. This tumor-derived sgp130 is functional because it binds in solution to the IL-6-soluble IL-6 receptor (gp80) complex. Recombinant sgp130 inhibits the growth inhibitory activity of the IL-6-soluble IL-6 receptor complex and OSM on some melanoma cell lines. Therefore, this soluble gp130 represents a natural antagonist of cytokines from the IL-6 family.","['Montero-Julian, F A', 'Brailly, H', 'Sautes, C', 'Joyeux, I', 'Dorval, T', 'Mosseri, V', 'Yasukawa, K', 'Wijdenes, J', 'Adler, A', 'Gorin, I', 'Fridman, W H', 'Tartour, E']","['Montero-Julian FA', 'Brailly H', 'Sautes C', 'Joyeux I', 'Dorval T', 'Mosseri V', 'Yasukawa K', 'Wijdenes J', 'Adler A', 'Gorin I', 'Fridman WH', 'Tartour E']","['Immunotech S.A., 130 Avenue de Lattre de Tassigny, BP 177 F, 13276 Marseille Cedex 09, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Ciliary Neurotrophic Factor)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (IL6ST protein, human)', '0 (Il6st protein, mouse)', '0 (Interleukin-11)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Nerve Tissue Proteins)', '0 (OSM protein, human)', '0 (Osm protein, mouse)', '0 (Peptides)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-6)', '106956-32-5 (Oncostatin M)', '133483-10-0 (Cytokine Receptor gp130)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, CD/biosynthesis/*physiology', 'Ciliary Neurotrophic Factor', 'Cytokine Receptor gp130', 'Cytokines/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Female', 'Growth Inhibitors/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-11/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Interleukin-6/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Lymphokines/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Melanoma/*physiopathology', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/biosynthesis/metabolism/*physiology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Nude', 'Nerve Tissue Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Oncostatin M', 'Peptides/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Receptors, Interleukin-6/antagonists & inhibitors/*physiology', 'Signal Transduction', 'Transplantation, Heterologous', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1997/08/01 00:00,1998/11/17 00:01,['1997/08/01 00:00'],"['1997/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/11/17 00:01 [medline]', '1997/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 1997 Aug;3(8):1443-51.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Expression of the MDR1 gene in leukemic cells was shown previously to be associated with worse clinical outcome of the patients. The multidrug resistance-associated protein (MRP) has been shown recently to be another protein causing the multidrug resistance phenotype in cell lines, but its impact on clinical outcome in patients with AML remains to be proven. To determine the clinical significance of MRP in patients with de novo AML, we have studied the MRP expression in leukemic cells and its association with both response to induction chemotherapy and survival of the patients. MRP gene expression was determined by immuno-cytochemistry (n = 80) by means of the monoclonal antibodies QCRL-1 and QCRL-3. MRP expression was low, intermediate, and high in 19, 55, and 26% of the patients, respectively. High MRP expression was independent of age and sex of the patients, WBC count, and percentage of blasts. However, high MRP expression was more frequent in the FAB M5 subtype as compared to the other subtypes. MRP expression had no impact on clinical outcome. The complete remission rates were 65, 68, and 63% for patients with low, intermediate, and high expression, respectively. Overall survival was also independent of MRP expression. In contrast, patients with P-glycoprotein-positive AML had lower complete remission rates and shorter durations of survival. These data indicate that MRP is expressed in patients with de novo AML but, in contrast to P-glycoprotein, does not predict for outcome of induction chemotherapy or survival.","['Filipits, M', 'Suchomel, R W', 'Zochbauer, S', 'Brunner, R', 'Lechner, K', 'Pirker, R']","['Filipits M', 'Suchomel RW', 'Zochbauer S', 'Brunner R', 'Lechner K', 'Pirker R']","['Divisions of Oncology and Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine I, University of Vienna Medical School, Wahringer Gurtel 18-20, A-1090 Vienna, Austria.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Controlled Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/analysis/*genetics', 'Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Cell Line', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage', 'Daunorubicin/administration & dosage', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Drug Resistance, Multiple/*genetics', 'Etoposide/administration & dosage', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*drug therapy/*genetics/mortality/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', 'Remission Induction', 'Survival Analysis', 'Time Factors', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1997/08/01 00:00,1998/11/17 00:01,['1997/08/01 00:00'],"['1997/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/11/17 00:01 [medline]', '1997/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 1997 Aug;3(8):1419-25.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recent trials of the fludarabine and ara-C therapy with or without growth factors suggested an improved clinical response by combining fludarabine and ara-C. The activity of these antimetabolites depends on their phosphorylation to the respective triphosphates, F-ara-ATP and ara-CTP. The principal mechanism through which these triphosphates cause cytotoxicity is incorporation into DNA and inhibition of further DNA synthesis. A model system of DNA primer extension on a defined template sequence was used to quantitate the consequences of incorporation of one or two analogues by human DNA polymerase alpha (pol alpha). The template (31-mer) was designed so that DNA pol alpha incorporated six deoxynucleotides (alternately G and T) on the 17-mer primer, followed by insertion of an A and then a C. The primer was then elongated with G and T to the full-length product. The apparent Kms of DNA pol alpha to incorporate these analogues (0. 053 and 0.077 microM, respectively) were similar to the Km for dCTP (0.037 microM) and dATP (0.044 microM), suggesting that the enzyme recognized these analogues and incorporated them efficiently on the growing DNA primer. The velocity of extension (Vmax) of these primers ranged between 0.53 and 0.77%/min when normal nucleotides were present. Once inserted at the 3'-terminus, F-ara-AMP or ara-CMP were poor substrates for extension. However, in reactions lacking dCTP and dATP and with high concentrations of ara-CTP, ara-CMP was inserted by pol alpha after incorporation of the F-ara-AMP residue. This tandem incorporation of the two analogues resulted in almost complete inhibition (99.3%) of further extension of the primer. In the presence of competing deoxynucleotides, each analogue resulted in a dose-dependent inhibition of DNA synthesis. When present together, inhibition of the primer elongation was more than additive at low concentrations of analogue triphosphates. Based on these results and the intracellular pharmacokinetics of ara-CTP and F-ara-ATP in leukemia blasts, we propose a pharmacodynamic model to explain interactions between these analogues during combination chemotherapy.","['Gandhi, V', 'Huang, P', 'Chapman, A J', 'Chen, F', 'Plunkett, W']","['Gandhi V', 'Huang P', 'Chapman AJ', 'Chen F', 'Plunkett W']","['Department of Clinical Investigation, The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas 77030, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Arabinonucleotides)', '0 (DNA Primers)', '106XV160TZ (Vidarabine Phosphate)', '3714-60-1 (ara-ATP)', '74832-57-8 (2-fluoro-araATP)', 'EC 2.7.7.7 (DNA Polymerase I)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacokinetics', 'Arabinonucleotides/*pharmacokinetics', 'Base Composition', 'Base Sequence', 'DNA Polymerase I/*metabolism', 'DNA Primers', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Substrate Specificity', 'Templates, Genetic', 'Vidarabine Phosphate/*analogs & derivatives/metabolism']",1997/08/01 00:00,1998/11/17 00:01,['1997/08/01 00:00'],"['1997/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/11/17 00:01 [medline]', '1997/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 1997 Aug;3(8):1347-55.,"['CA28596/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA57629/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We demonstrated previously that noncytotoxic doses of various genotoxic chemicals, particularly DNA cross-linking agents, preferentially altered expression of inducible genes. These effects occurred principally at the transcriptional level and were closely correlated temporally with DNA damage. Because the mdr1 gene coding for P-glycoprotein has been reported to be highly inducible, we were interested in the effects of genotoxic cancer chemotherapy agents on its expression. We report that the DNA cross-linking agent mitomycin C significantly suppressed mRNA and protein expression of P-glycoprotein and decreased the rate of drug efflux. Mitomycin C pretreatment also significantly increased the sensitivity of cancer cells to subsequent killing by the P-glycoprotein substrate doxorubicin, decreasing the ED50 by 5- to 10-fold. Suppression of P-glycoprotein expression was also observed with subtoxic doses of the DNA cross-linking agents cisplatin, BMS181174, and chromium(VI). These effects occurred in both human and rodent cell lines; in cell lines derived from colon, breast, leukemia, neuroblastoma, and hepatoma tumors; and under both monolayer and ""spheroid"" culture conditions. These results suggest the basis for novel clinical cancer chemotherapy regimens aimed at drug-resistant tumors, in which a sub-chemotherapeutic dose of a DNA cross-linking agent is used to modulate the multidrug resistance phenotype prior to treatment with a second cytotoxic agent.","['Ihnat, M A', 'Lariviere, J P', 'Warren, A J', 'La Ronde, N', 'Blaxall, J R', 'Pierre, K M', 'Turpie, B W', 'Hamilton, J W']","['Ihnat MA', 'Lariviere JP', 'Warren AJ', 'La Ronde N', 'Blaxall JR', 'Pierre KM', 'Turpie BW', 'Hamilton JW']","['Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, Dartmouth Medical School, Hanover, New Hampshire 03755-3835, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating)', '0 (Cross-Linking Reagents)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Mitomycins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '50SG953SK6 (Mitomycin)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', '95056-36-3 (N-7-(2-(nitrophenyldithio)ethyl)mitomycin C)', 'CJ0O37KU29 (Verapamil)', 'Q20Q21Q62J (Cisplatin)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*toxicity', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating/toxicity', 'Breast Neoplasms', 'Carcinoma, Hepatocellular', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cisplatin/toxicity', 'Colonic Neoplasms', 'Cross-Linking Reagents/*toxicity', 'DNA Damage', 'DNA, Neoplasm/drug effects', 'Doxorubicin/toxicity', 'Drug Resistance, Multiple/*genetics', 'Female', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Liver Neoplasms', 'Mitomycin/toxicity', '*Mitomycins/toxicity', 'Neuroblastoma', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis', 'Rats', 'Transcription, Genetic/*drug effects', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Verapamil/pharmacology']",1997/08/01 00:00,1998/11/17 00:01,['1997/08/01 00:00'],"['1997/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/11/17 00:01 [medline]', '1997/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 1997 Aug;3(8):1339-46.,"['CA23108/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA49002/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Twenty-four patients with advanced CEA-positive colorectal cancer who failed standard therapies except for two were entered into this Phase Ib trial. One patient was considered not assessable, because on the day of entering into the study, she was diagnosed with acute myelogenous leukemia.

Immunological monitoring included humoral and cellular idiotypic and CEA responses, and all patients were evaluated for toxicity, response, and survival. Hyperimmune sera from 17 of 23 patients demonstrated an anti-anti-idiotypic Ab3 response, and 13 of these responses were demonstrated to be true anti-CEA responses (Ab1'). The antibody response was polyclonal, and 11 mediated antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity. Ten patients had idiotypic T-cell responses, and five had specific T-cell responses to CEA. None of the patients had objective clinical responses, but overall median survival for the 23 evaluable patients was 11.3 months, with 44% 1-year survival (95% confidence interval, 23-64%). Toxicity was limited to local swelling and minimal pain. Anti-idiotype monoclonal antibody 3H1 that mimics CEA was able to break immune tolerance in the majority of treated patients. Overall survival of 11.3 months was comparable to other phase II data with advanced colorectal cancer patients treated with a variety of chemotherapy agents, including irinotecan, with considerably less toxicity. Although it is not clear that the vaccine itself had an impact on survival, this should be determined in a Phase III randomized trial.","['Foon, K A', 'John, W J', 'Chakraborty, M', 'Sherratt, A', 'Garrison, J', 'Flett, M', 'Bhattacharya-Chatterjee, M']","['Foon KA', 'John WJ', 'Chakraborty M', 'Sherratt A', 'Garrison J', 'Flett M', 'Bhattacharya-Chatterjee M']","['Lucille Parker Markey Cancer Center, Department of Internal Medicine, Division of Hematology/Oncology, University of Kentucky Medical Center, Lexington, Kentucky 40536, USA.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,"['0 (Antibodies, Anti-Idiotypic)', '0 (Antibodies, Heterophile)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Autoantibodies)', '0 (Cancer Vaccines)', '0 (Carcinoembryonic Antigen)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antibodies, Anti-Idiotypic/*therapeutic use', 'Antibodies, Heterophile/blood', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/*therapeutic use', 'Antibody-Dependent Cell Cytotoxicity', 'Autoantibodies/blood', '*Cancer Vaccines', 'Carcinoembryonic Antigen/blood/*immunology', 'Colorectal Neoplasms/*immunology/mortality/pathology/*therapy', 'Disease Progression', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Patient Selection', 'Survival Analysis', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Time Factors']",1997/08/01 00:00,1998/11/17 00:01,['1997/08/01 00:00'],"['1997/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/11/17 00:01 [medline]', '1997/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 1997 Aug;3(8):1267-76.,['P01 CA5880-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this patient group, the effect of radiolabeled Lym-1 treatment as indicated by measurable tumor response was associated with improved survival. Development of HAMA was also associated with improved survival, indicating that concern about HAMA should not preclude exploration of radioimmunotherapy.

We found that a small organic molecule, N-[4-(trifluoromethyl)phenyl] 5-methylisoxazole-4-carboxamide (SU101, leflunomide), inhibited PDGF-mediated signaling events, including receptor tyrosine phosphorylation, DNA synthesis, cell cycle progression, and cell proliferation. SU101 inhibited PDGF-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of PDGF receptor (PDGFR) beta in C6 (rat glioma) and NIH3T3 cells engineered to overexpress human PDGFRbeta (3T3-PDGFRbeta). SU101 blocked both PDGF- and epidermal growth factor (EGF)-stimulated DNA synthesis. Previously, this compound was shown to inhibit pyrimidine biosynthesis by interfering with the enzymatic activity of dihydroorotate dehydrogenase. In the current study, EGF-stimulated DNA synthesis was restored by the addition of saturating quantities of uridine, whereas PDGF-induced DNA synthesis was not, suggesting that the compound demonstrated some selectivity for the PDGFR pathway that was independent of pyrimidine biosynthesis. Selectivity was further demonstrated by the ability of the compound to block the entry of PDGF-stimulated cells into the S phase of the cell cycle, without affecting cell cycle progression of EGF-stimulated cells. In cell growth assays, SU101 selectively inhibited the growth of PDGFRbeta-expressing cell lines more efficiently than it inhibited the growth of PDGFRbeta-negative cell lines. SU101 inhibited the s.c., i.p., and intracerebral growth of a panel of cell lines including cells from glioma, ovarian, and prostate origin. In contrast, SU101 failed to inhibit the in vitro or s.c. growth of A431 and KB tumor cells, both of which express EGF receptor but not PDGFRbeta. SU101 also inhibited the growth of D1B and L1210 (murine leukemia) cells in syngeneic immunocompetent mice, without causing adverse effects on the immune response of the animals. In an i.p. model of tumor growth in syngeneic immunocompetent mice, SU101 prevented tumor growth and induced long-term survivors in animals implanted with 7TD1 (murine B-cell hybridoma) tumor cells. Because PDGFRbeta was detected on most of the tumor cell lines in which in vivo growth was inhibited by SU101, these data suggest that SU101 is an effective inhibitor of PDGF-driven tumor growth in vivo.","['Shawver, L K', 'Schwartz, D P', 'Mann, E', 'Chen, H', 'Tsai, J', 'Chu, L', 'Taylorson, L', 'Longhi, M', 'Meredith, S', 'Germain, L', 'Jacobs, J S', 'Tang, C', 'Ullrich, A', 'Berens, M E', 'Hersh, E', 'McMahon, G', 'Hirth, K P', 'Powell, T J']","['Shawver LK', 'Schwartz DP', 'Mann E', 'Chen H', 'Tsai J', 'Chu L', 'Taylorson L', 'Longhi M', 'Meredith S', 'Germain L', 'Jacobs JS', 'Tang C', 'Ullrich A', 'Berens ME', 'Hersh E', 'McMahon G', 'Hirth KP', 'Powell TJ']","['SUGEN, Inc., Redwood City, California 94063, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,"['0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Isoxazoles)', '0 (Platelet-Derived Growth Factor)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '62229-50-9 (Epidermal Growth Factor)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor, Platelet-Derived Growth Factor beta)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptors, Platelet-Derived Growth Factor)', 'G162GK9U4W (Leflunomide)']",IM,"['3T3 Cells', 'Animals', 'Brain Neoplasms/drug therapy/pathology', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Epidermal Growth Factor/pharmacology', 'Female', 'Glioma/drug therapy/*pathology', 'Growth Inhibitors/therapeutic use/*toxicity', 'Humans', 'Isoxazoles/*therapeutic use/*toxicity', 'Leflunomide', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Nude', 'Ovarian Neoplasms/drug therapy/*pathology', 'Platelet-Derived Growth Factor/antagonists & inhibitors/pharmacology/*physiology', 'Prostatic Neoplasms/drug therapy/*pathology', 'Rats', 'Receptor, Platelet-Derived Growth Factor beta', 'Receptors, Platelet-Derived Growth Factor/drug effects/*physiology', 'Recombinant Proteins/biosynthesis/drug effects', 'Signal Transduction/*drug effects/physiology', 'Transfection', 'Transplantation, Heterologous', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1997/07/01 00:00,1998/11/17 00:01,['1997/07/01 00:00'],"['1997/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/11/17 00:01 [medline]', '1997/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 1997 Jul;3(7):1167-77.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

ZD9331 is the gamma-tetrazole analogue of 2-desamino-2, 7-dimethyl-N10-propargyl-2'fluoro-5,8-dideaza folate (ZM214888), with a TS Ki of approximately 0.4 nM. ZD9331 exhibits potent growth inhibitory and cytotoxic activity; e.g., IC50 for the inhibition of human W1L2 lymphoblastoid cell line was 7 nM. The addition of thymidine to the culture medium increased the IC50 in W1L2 cells >10, 000-fold, demonstrating the high specificity of the drug for TS. ZD9331 is transported into cells predominantly via the RFC. Accordingly, it competes with methotrexate (MTX) and folinic acid for cellular uptake and has reduced activity against two cell lines with low expression of the RFC (L1210:1565 and CEM/MTX). In addition, a cell line with acquired resistance to ZD9331 displays reduced uptake of both ZD9331 and MTX. A mouse cell line (L1210:RD1694), with acquired resistance to ZD1694 due to reduced folylpolyglutamate synthetase activity, was not significantly cross-resistant to ZD9331. The flux through TS, as measured by 3H release from 5-[3H]deoxyuridine, was rapidly inhibited when cells were incubated with ZD9331. However, because ZD9331 cannot form polyglutamates, TS activity recovered rapidly once cells were placed in drug-free medium. The minimum curative dose of ZD9331 in the i.m. L5178Y TK-/- tumor model was approximately 3 mg/kg when given by 24-h continuous infusion, and it was 25-50 mg/kg when given by a single i.p. or i.v. injection. ZD9331 had antitumor activity against the L5178Y TK+/- tumor when administered by 7-day continuous infusion; growth delays of more than 5 days (and some cures) were seen at doses of 25-50 mg/kg/day. At higher doses, significant weight loss (gastrointestinal toxicity) and myelosuppression (neutropenia and thrombocytopenia) were observed, suggesting that these may be dose-limiting toxicities in the Phase I clinical studies.","['Jackman, A L', 'Kimbell, R', 'Aherne, G W', 'Brunton, L', 'Jansen, G', 'Stephens, T C', 'Smith, M N', 'Wardleworth, J M', 'Boyle, F T']","['Jackman AL', 'Kimbell R', 'Aherne GW', 'Brunton L', 'Jansen G', 'Stephens TC', 'Smith MN', 'Wardleworth JM', 'Boyle FT']","['The Cancer Research Campaign Centre for Cancer Therapeutics at the Institute of Cancer Research, 15 Cotswold Road, Sutton, Surrey, SM2 5NG United Kingdom. annj@icr.ac.uk']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Quinazolines)', '0 (ZD 9331)', 'EC 2.1.1.45 (Thymidylate Synthase)', 'Q573I9DVLP (Leucovorin)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use/*toxicity', 'Biological Transport/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Leucovorin/pharmacology', 'Leukemia L1210', 'Leukemia L5178/*drug therapy', 'Methotrexate/pharmacokinetics', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred DBA', 'Quinazolines/*pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use/*toxicity', 'Thymidylate Synthase/*antagonists & inhibitors/deficiency', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Stem Cell Assay']",1997/06/01 00:00,1998/11/17 00:01,['1997/06/01 00:00'],"['1997/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/11/17 00:01 [medline]', '1997/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 1997 Jun;3(6):911-21.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Etoposide plasma concentrations were measured in patients randomized to the 21-day schedule and correlated with toxicity and tumor response. Patients were treated with etoposide (50 mg/m2/day) orally for 21 days and cisplatin (33 mg/m2/day) i.v. for 3 consecutive days every 28 days for 6 courses. Plasma samples before the daily etoposide dose (trough concentrations) and complete blood counts were obtained weekly during treatment. The average of three etoposide concentrations (EC) per course was calculated. Of 158 patients registered to this schedule of the study, 150 were eligible. In 106 patients, etoposide samples were obtained at least in the first course in which the mean EC was 0.39 microgram/ml (SD = 0.29). In 102 patients (missing albumin values in 4 of 106 patients), the concentration of etoposide not bound to protein (Efree) was estimated based on the following equation: percentage unbound = (1.4 x total bilirubin) - (6.8 x albumin) + 34.4. Regression analysis revealed that increasing age was correlated with higher EC (r = 0.27; two-tailed P < 0.01) and Efree (r = 0.31; two-tailed P < 0.01). Higher EC and Efree values were associated with lower WBC counts and absolute neutrophil counts after the first treatment course in 83 patients with nadir counts. Using multiple linear regression, a pharmacodynamic model was developed that included EC or Efree, age, and alkaline phosphatase. An interaction with bone marrow results at diagnosis was found, indicating a sharper decline in nadir counts with increasing EC or Efree when the marrow was involved with small cell lung cancer. This model explained 29% of the variation for WBC nadirs (P < 0.001) and 31% of the variation for absolute neutrophil count nadirs (P < 0. 001). Neither EC nor Efree showed a significant correlation with tumor response. A pharmacokinetic relationship between EC or Efree and age was found. A pharmacodynamic model could be developed for toxicity but not for tumor response.","['Miller, A A', 'Rosner, G L', 'Ratain, M J', 'Hollis, D R', 'Green, M R', 'Schilsky, R L']","['Miller AA', 'Rosner GL', 'Ratain MJ', 'Hollis DR', 'Green MR', 'Schilsky RL']","['University of Tennessee, Memphis, Tennessee 38163, USA. amiller@utmem1.utmem.edu']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Clinical Trial, Phase II', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,"['6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', 'Q20Q21Q62J (Cisplatin)']",IM,"['Administration, Oral', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Carcinoma, Small Cell/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Cisplatin/administration & dosage/*pharmacokinetics', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Etoposide/administration & dosage/*pharmacokinetics', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infusions, Intravenous', 'Lung Neoplasms/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Regression Analysis', 'Time Factors']",1997/05/01 00:00,1998/11/17 00:01,['1997/05/01 00:00'],"['1997/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/11/17 00:01 [medline]', '1997/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 1997 May;3(5):719-25.,"['CA33601/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA41287/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA47555/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We conducted a pediatric Phase I trial of TG administered as a continuous i.v. infusion (CIV). A pharmacokinetically guided dose escalation was performed to define the dose rate of TG required to achieve a steady-state plasma concentration (Css) exceeding the target concentration of 1 microM, and then the maximum tolerated duration of infusion of TG at this dose rate was defined. Eighteen patients (median age, 18 years; range, 4-25 years) with refractory malignancies (16 solid tumors and 2 ALL) were enrolled in this study. The starting dose rate of 10 mg/m2/h administered for 24 h achieved an average Css of 0.9 microM (range, 0.7-1.2 microM). Therefore, the dose rate was escalated to 20 mg/m2/h, which achieved an average Css of 4.1 microM (range, 1. 0-8.3 microM). This disproportionate increase in the Css of TG suggested a capacity-limited (saturable) elimination process, and a pharmacokinetic model incorporating two compartments with capacity-limited elimination from the central compartment was developed to describe the disposition of TG. The TG clearances (derived from model parameters) at the 10- and 20-mg/m2/h dose rates were 987 and 608 ml/min/m2, respectively. Dose-limiting myelosuppression (absolute granulocyte count < 500/mm3 and platelet count < 25,000/mm3) was observed in two of three patients treated with a dose rate of 20 mg/m2/h administered for 36 h. Administration of CIV of TG at 20 mg/m2/h for 24 h was well tolerated in nine patients. Nonhematological toxicities included nonneutropenic infections and mild, reversible changes in hepatic function tests.

The junctional region of fusion proteins represents a potential target for a T cell-mediated antitumor response. T lymphocytes recognize antigens in the form of short peptides that must bind to HLA molecules. Different HLA specificities can bind different peptides, thus depicting different ""peptide binding motifs."" It would be useful to know whether a certain fusion protein presents, within its fusion region, the binding motif(s) for a certain HLA molecule. This information would allow a more focused immunological analysis. Here we present data obtained from the screening of the fusion regions of 44 different fusion proteins for the presence of binding motifs to 34 class I HLA molecules, including all of the most frequently encountered specificities. A total of 201 independent peptides was identified (range, 0-11 peptides/fusion protein). A marked heterogeneity among the 44 different fusion proteins analyzed is evident. For example, the pml/RARalpha fusion protein present in acute promyelocytic leukemia presents no binding motif (BCR 3) at all or to a single HLA molecule (Cw*0301, BCR 1). Alternatively, the fusion proteins BCR/ABL, ALL1/AF-6, EWS/ATF-1, or NPM/ALK exhibit motifs for several common HLA specificities. Heterogeneity is also present inside a single translocation (in ALL1/ENL, for example, different subtypes match motifs with cumulative frequencies in the population from 108 to 0%). In two cases where the relative frequency of different fusion protein subtypes was available, a tendency toward an inverse relationship between frequency and the percentage of population covered by the identified binding motifs was observed. Peptides with motifs for HLA A*0201, A3, and Cw*0702 were also tested for actual binding using a stabilization assay; 13-40% showed significant HLA binding, using this assay. However, fewer fusion protein-derived peptides bound to HLA A*0201 and A3 than non-fusion protein-derived peptides. These data provide the first list of peptides derived from fusion proteins that may be assessed as potential tumor-specific antigens.","['Gambacorti-Passerini, C', 'Bertazzoli, C', 'Dermime, S', 'Scardino, A', 'Schendel, D', 'Parmiani, G']","['Gambacorti-Passerini C', 'Bertazzoli C', 'Dermime S', 'Scardino A', 'Schendel D', 'Parmiani G']","['Division of Experimental Oncology D, Istituto Nazionale Tumori, Via Venezian 1, 20133 Milan, Italy. gambacorti@ici164.cilea.it']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,"['0 (Histocompatibility Antigens Class I)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Peptide Fragments)', '0 (Peptide Library)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Binding Sites', 'Histocompatibility Antigens Class I/*chemistry/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Neoplasms/*genetics/immunology', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*chemistry/*immunology', 'Peptide Fragments/chemistry/immunology', 'Peptide Library', '*Translocation, Genetic']",1997/05/01 00:00,1998/11/17 00:01,['1997/05/01 00:00'],"['1997/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/11/17 00:01 [medline]', '1997/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 1997 May;3(5):675-83.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Telomerase activity was analyzed in 78 acute leukemia patients and ranged from 0.65 to 147 relative to the internal standard. Compared to the age-matched normal levels of telomerase activity in the peripheral blood cells, we determined that 45 (81.8%) of 55 acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and 16 (69.6%) of 23 acute lymphoid leukemia patients had elevated telomerase activity. There was no relationship between peak telomere length and telomerase activity in both acute lymphoid leukemia and AML patients. In AML, the level of telomerase activity was associated with French-American-British subtypes and cytogenetics, and patients with elevated telomerase activity had high leukocyte counts and more frequent extramedullary involvement during the disease. Among 78 patients, 5 had high levels of telomerase activities similar to immortalized leukemia cell lines; these 5 patients had a very poor prognosis (P < 0.05). The levels of telomerase activity significantly decreased in patients in complete remission. Most of the patients in complete remission showed a normal level of telomerase activity; however, two of them had low to moderate telomerase activity, and they relapsed shortly after entering complete remission. In relapsed patients, there is a general trend for increased telomerase levels, and 2 of the 13 patients retained high telomerase activity, whereas the other 11 had normal to moderate telomerase activity. These results suggest that telomerase activity may be a useful additional method for monitoring the disease condition in acute leukemia patients.","['Ohyashiki, J H', 'Ohyashiki, K', 'Iwama, H', 'Hayashi, S', 'Toyama, K', 'Shay, J W']","['Ohyashiki JH', 'Ohyashiki K', 'Iwama H', 'Hayashi S', 'Toyama K', 'Shay JW']","['First Department of Internal Medicine, Tokyo Medical College, 6-7-1 Nishi-shinjuku, Shinjuku-ju, Tokyo 160, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (Telomerase)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Automation', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/blood/*metabolism', 'Bone Marrow/enzymology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/blood/*enzymology/genetics/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/blood/*enzymology/genetics/pathology', 'Reference Values', 'Repetitive Sequences, Nucleic Acid', 'Telomerase/blood/genetics/*metabolism', 'Translocation, Genetic']",1997/04/01 00:00,1998/11/17 00:01,['1997/04/01 00:00'],"['1997/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/11/17 00:01 [medline]', '1997/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 1997 Apr;3(4):619-25.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Because of the structural similarity of SPA to inhibitors of glycoprotein processing, we examined the effect of SPA on indicators of glycoprotein synthesis and processing in HL60TB promyelocytic leukemia and Colo 205 colon carcinoma cells. Brief periods of exposure ( approximately 30 min) to SPA at the IC50 for growth increased incorporation of [3H]mannose. When examined by Western blotting after prolonged (40-48 h) incubation with lectins that target mannose-containing carbohydrates, Galanthus nivalis agglutinin and concanavalin A, a qualitative change in the pattern of mannose-containing glycoproteins was observed in HL60TB cells. Significant changes in the pattern of surface glycoprotein expression in intact cells were demonstrated by flow cytometry using fluorescence-labeled lectins. An increase in the number of cells binding G. nivalis agglutinin (indicating terminal mannose) was noted, but a decrease in the amount of lectin bound per cell was noted for wheat germ agglutinin (detecting sialic acid and terminal beta-N-acetyl glucosamine residues). Electron microscopy revealed loss of microvilli, and the Golgi apparatus appeared inflated. Our findings, therefore, raise the possibility that cells exposed to SPA have altered glycoprotein processing after exposure to low concentrations of drug, prior to the occurrence of overt cytotoxicity. These effects are consistent with a prominent early effect of SPA on the enzymatic machinery or organelles important for proper glycoprotein processing and emphasize the novelty of this agent's likely mechanism of action.","['Burger, A M', 'Kaur, G', 'Hollingshead, M', 'Fischer, R T', 'Nagashima, K', 'Malspeis, L', 'Duncan, K L', 'Sausville, E A']","['Burger AM', 'Kaur G', 'Hollingshead M', 'Fischer RT', 'Nagashima K', 'Malspeis L', 'Duncan KL', 'Sausville EA']","['Biological Testing Branch, Laboratory of Pharmaceutical Chemistry, Frederick Cancer Research and Development Center, Frederick, MD 21702-1201, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,"['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Glycoproteins)', '0 (Lectins)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Plant Lectins)', '0 (Purine Nucleosides)', '8VH13L5K20 (KRN 5500)', 'PHA4727WTP (Mannose)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/therapeutic use/*toxicity', 'Cell Division/*drug effects', 'Colonic Neoplasms/*drug therapy/pathology/ultrastructure', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Galanthus', 'Glycoproteins/*biosynthesis', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Lectins', 'Mannose/metabolism', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/*biosynthesis', 'Mice', 'Mice, Nude', 'Plant Lectins', 'Purine Nucleosides/therapeutic use/toxicity', 'Transplantation, Heterologous', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1997/03/01 00:00,1998/11/17 00:01,['1997/03/01 00:00'],"['1997/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/11/17 00:01 [medline]', '1997/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 1997 Mar;3(3):455-63.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recently, we found frequent deletion of MTAP in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) patients both at diagnosis and at relapse (A. Batova et al., Blood, 88: 3083-3090, 1996). In addition, MTAP deficiency has been reported in other cancers. Thus, MTAP deficiency in cancer may offer opportunities for developing selective therapy, which would spare normal cells. It is therefore important to document the presence of MTAP activity in hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells. Our approach was to investigate whether hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells can be rescued from the cytotoxicity of an AMP synthesis inhibitor, L-alanosine, by 5'-deoxyadenosine, a process that requires MTAP. Erythroid burst-forming unit, granulocyte/monocyte colony-forming unit, or granulocyte/erythrocyte/macrophage/megakaryocyte colony-forming unit progenitors and the primitive high proliferative potential colony-forming cells in the purified CD34(+) cells were cultured in horse serum-containing medium, and their colony growth was found to be suppressed by incubation with 5 microM or greater concentrations of L-alanosine. However, in the presence of 5-10 microM of 5'-deoxyadenosine, colony formation of hematopoietic stem/primitive progenitors was restored. On the other hand, 5'-deoxy-5'-methylthioadenosine, the endogenous substrate of MTAP, was toxic to hematopoietic stem/progenitors (ID50 < 1 microM), presumably due to inhibition of methylation reactions or polyamine synthesis. We also compared the effects of L-alanosine and 5'-deoxyadenosine on MTAP (+) and MTAP (-) T-ALL cell lines. Treatment of MTAP (+) Molt 4 and MTAP (-) CEM cell lines with L-alanosine in the presence of 5'-deoxyadenosine resulted in killing of MTAP (-), but not MTAP (+) cells. Therefore, our findings demonstrate the presence of MTAP in human hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells and support the possibility of targeting MTAP in the design of an enzyme-selective therapy for T-ALL and other MTAP-deficient malignancies.","['Yu, J', 'Batova, A', 'Shao, L', 'Carrera, C J', 'Yu, A L']","['Yu J', 'Batova A', 'Shao L', 'Carrera CJ', 'Yu AL']","['Department of Molecular and Experimental Medicine, The Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla, California 92037, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,"['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Deoxyadenosines)', '2CNI71214Y (alanosine)', 'EC 2.4.2.1 (Purine-Nucleoside Phosphorylase)', ""EC 2.4.2.28 (5'-methylthioadenosine phosphorylase)"", 'OF5P57N2ZX (Alanine)']",IM,"['Alanine/analogs & derivatives/toxicity', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/*toxicity', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'Deoxyadenosines/pharmacology', 'Drug Design', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*cytology/drug effects/*enzymology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/genetics/*pathology', 'Purine-Nucleoside Phosphorylase/analysis/deficiency/*metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Stem Cell Assay']",1997/03/01 00:00,1998/11/17 00:01,['1997/03/01 00:00'],"['1997/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/11/17 00:01 [medline]', '1997/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 1997 Mar;3(3):433-8.,"['CA54892/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'MO1 RR00827/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', 'U10CA28439/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A panel of 33 cell lines was studied for their ability to be transduced by an adenoviral (AD) vector encoding the Escherichia coli beta-galactosidase gene (AD-betagal). A cytochemical assay and a flow cytometry assay both demonstrated that a subset of lymphocytic cell lines can be efficiently transduced by adenoviral vectors. In particular, three of three anaplastic large cell lymphoma lines, two of two Hodgkin's disease cell lines, two of seven Burkitt's lymphoma cell lines, and three of five myeloma cell lines exhibited efficient gene transfer. The ability of an AD vector expressing the thymidine kinase (tk) gene from herpes simplex virus-1 (AD-tk) followed by ganciclovir (GCV) to kill 11 of these lymphocytic cell lines was studied. In eight of the cell lines tested, more than 68% of the cells were killed by AD-tk/GCV. Similar results were obtained using an adenoviral vector expressing the wild-type p53 tumor suppressor gene (AD-p53). Thus, AD-tk/GCV and AD-p53 both demonstrated efficient killing of these cell lines. These data document that adenoviral vectors are valuable reagents for the introduction of genes into selected lymphocytic cell lines. These data also suggest that adenoviral vectors might be useful for gene therapy of subsets of lymphocytic malignancy.","['Meeker, T C', 'Lay, L T', 'Wroblewski, J M', 'Turturro, F', 'Li, Z', 'Seth, P']","['Meeker TC', 'Lay LT', 'Wroblewski JM', 'Turturro F', 'Li Z', 'Seth P']","['Departments of Medicine and Biochemistry and the Markey Cancer Center, University of Kentucky, Lexington, Kentucky 40536, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,"['0 (Antiviral Agents)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.1.21 (Thymidine Kinase)', 'EC 3.2.1.23 (beta-Galactosidase)', 'P9G3CKZ4P5 (Ganciclovir)']",IM,"['Adenoviridae/*genetics', 'Antiviral Agents/*toxicity', 'Burkitt Lymphoma', 'Cell Survival/*drug effects', 'Ganciclovir/*toxicity', 'Genetic Therapy/methods', 'Genetic Vectors', 'HeLa Cells', 'Herpesvirus 1, Human/enzymology/*genetics', 'Hodgkin Disease', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell', 'Lymphoma', 'Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse', 'Multiple Myeloma', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/biosynthesis', 'Thymidine Kinase/*genetics', 'Transfection/*methods', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'beta-Galactosidase/genetics']",1997/03/01 00:00,1998/11/17 00:01,['1997/03/01 00:00'],"['1997/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/11/17 00:01 [medline]', '1997/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 1997 Mar;3(3):357-64.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

B43-PAP was retained and distributed largely in the blood as the sole compartment with no significant equilibration with the extravascular compartment. The circulating B43-PAP immunotoxin detected in monkey plasma samples by ELISA and protein immunoblotting was both immunoreactive with, and active against, human leukemic cells in vitro. In systemic immunogenicity and toxicity studies, which involved 11 cynomolgus monkeys, each monkey received a total of seven i.v. doses of B43-PAP at a specific dose level of the dose escalation schedule. B43-PAP-treated monkeys mounted a dose-dependent humoral immune response against both the mouse IgG and PAP moieties of the immunotoxin. When administered i.v. either on an every-day or every-other-day schedule, B43-PAP was very well tolerated, with no significant clinical or laboratory signs of toxicity at total dose levels ranging from 0.007 to 0.7 mg/kg.

These models were applied clinically, and the concepts of combination chemotherapy, remission induction, and maintenance treatment all developed in leukemia. Subsequently, the predominant impact of cytogenetics on probability of response to treatment and survival was first illustrated in leukemia. The power of a single drug to change the natural history of a disease was noted in acute myelogenous leukemia, in which a previously incurable disease was rendered potentially curable with 1-beta-D-arabinofuranosylcytosine. Additional studies illustrated the exquisite relationship between karyotype and response to specific agents. The ability to achieve a high proportion of complete remissions and to control the complication of intravascular coagulation, acute promyelocytic was noted with all-trans retinoic acid. The concept that new drug activity would only be demonstrated in patients with minimal prior therapy has been challenged by the curative potential of a number of agents in far-advanced hairy cell leukemia. In addition, fludarabine monophosphate (Fludara) was sufficiently active in advanced refractory patients that approval for this agent in chronic lymphocytic leukemia was granted by the Food and Drug Administration without comparative clinical trials. Fludara was initially a drug with limited therapeutic range, active only in indolent lymphoproliferative disorders. However, understanding of the multiple biochemical actions of this agent has led to its use in combinations with 1-beta-D-arabinofuranosylcytosine in acute myelogenous leukemia and myelodysplastic syndrome and with DNA active agents such as novantrone and cyclophosphamide in other lymphoproliferative disorders. The understanding of the various actions of this drug gives rise to a wide range of possibilities for biochemical modulation with agents active in solid tumors. The evolution of this understanding of the new role of Fludara has occurred over a period of 10 years. A drug with similar potential in the next decade is compound 506U78, an analogue of arabinosyl guanosine. This agent has potent activity in acute T-cell leukemia. Because it shares many of the activities of Fludara in interfering with enzyme systems important in DNA and RNA synthesis and DNA repair, it is likely that this agent will also have a wider scope than is presently obvious. The unique accessibility of leukemia cells for study has allowed hematologists to understand more fully the range of activities of new agents and has led to important new concepts in the area of drug development.","['Keating, M J']",['Keating MJ'],"['University of Texas M.

This is true even in randomized trials in which the number of patients randomized is less than 200. Hence analysis of prognostic factors is crucial in historically controlled and small randomized trials. However, it is known that factors found prognostic in one series are often not prognostic in another. This is a result of the increased type I error inherent in most methods used to identify the optimal cutpoint of a potential prognostic factor. This report describes new graphical methods, based on Martingale residuals, that can be used to better identify the relationship between outcome and a covariate. For example, use of these methods indicated that the effect of antecedent hematological disorder on survival in acute myelogenous leukemia/myelodysplastic syndrome is continuous (the longer the length of antecedent hematological disorder, the shorter the survival) rather than dichotomous (antecedent hematological disorder present = unfavorable). This report also discusses the use of graphical methods to test the assumption of proportional hazards crucial to the Cox model and to account for any time-varying effects of a prognostic factor. The graphical methods discussed here provide a better fit of a statistical model to the data and provide more reliable estimates of the effect of a particular variable.","['Estey, E']",['Estey E'],"['Department of Hematology, University of Texas M.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the potential activity of tallimustine in leukemia. In this study, we first investigated the efficacy and toxic effects of tallimustine, a distamycin-A derivative, in a human leukemia model in severe combined immunodeficient (SCID) mice. On the basis of its dramatic activity in this preclinical study, a Phase I study of tallimustine at a starting dose of 300 microgram/m2/day for 3 days every 3-4 weeks was conducted in patients with refractory or relapsed leukemia. In SCID mice grafted with a human myelomonocytic leukemia cell line, tallimustine resulted in complete remission of disease in most mice at tolerable dosages ranging from 0.86 to 3.0 mg/kg/day for 3 days and was combined effectively and safely with a 2-day schedule of high-dose ara-C. In the Phase I study, 26 patients with refractory or relapsed leukemia were treated. The maximum tolerated dose was 900 microgram/m2/day for 3 days every 3-4 weeks. This dose was 3 times higher than the maximum tolerated dose in solid tumors and was limited by severe mucositis. Magnesium and potassium wasting were also observed, but other side effects (fatigue and gastrointestinal) were minor. Two (8%) patients with AML achieved complete remission and two achieved hematological improvement with persistent thrombocytopenia. The results of this study indicate that tallimustine has promising activity in AML. Future studies may combine tallimustine with other agents known to be active against AML, and investigate its activity in other hematological malignancies. The recommended Phase II single-agent dose of tallimustine is 750-900 microgram/m2/day for 3 days, and combination studies may start at 50-66% of this dose schedule. The SCID mouse model of human leukemia may be promising in the preclinical evaluation and selection of potential antileukemic agents.","['Beran, M', 'Jeha, S', ""O'Brien, S"", 'Estey, E', 'Vitek, L', 'Zurlo, M G', 'Rios, M B', 'Keating, M', 'Kantarjian, H']","['Beran M', 'Jeha S', ""O'Brien S"", 'Estey E', 'Vitek L', 'Zurlo MG', 'Rios MB', 'Keating M', 'Kantarjian H']","['Leukemia Department, Division of Medicine, The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas 77030, USA.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Clinical Trial, Phase I', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Distamycins)', '0 (Nitrogen Mustard Compounds)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '71193OXG6S (tallimustine)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage/*adverse effects', 'Cytarabine/therapeutic use', 'Diarrhea/chemically induced', 'Distamycins/administration & dosage/*adverse effects', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Injections, Intravenous', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Acute/drug therapy', 'Mice', 'Mice, SCID', 'Middle Aged', 'Nausea/chemically induced', 'Nitrogen Mustard Compounds/administration & dosage/*adverse effects', 'Transplantation, Heterologous', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Vomiting/chemically induced']",1998/11/17 00:00,1998/11/17 00:01,['1998/11/17 00:00'],"['1998/11/17 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/11/17 00:01 [medline]', '1998/11/17 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 1997 Dec;3(12 Pt 1):2377-84.,['CA-16672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Thirty-eight patients (thirty-six with high risk or metastatic breast cancer) were treated in a dose-escalation trial using a fixed dose of i.v. cyclophosphamide (4.2 g/m2) administered over 2 h on day 5 and escalating doses of doxorubicin (50-175 mg/m2) given as a 96-h continuous i.v. infusion on days 1-4, using Filgrastim (granulocyte colony-stimulating factor) for hematological support beginning on day 6. All patients underwent pretreatment, and 28 patients underwent postchemotherapy endomyocardial biopsies. Twenty-nine of 38 patients received two cycles of treatment (median number of days between cycles, 44; range, 34-62). Twenty-one patients had received doxorubicin previously at cumulative dose levels </=150 mg/m2; all patients had pretreatment endomyocardial biopsy scores less than 1. One patient treated at the highest dose level of doxorubicin (175 mg/m2) developed symptoms of mild congestive heart failure following two cycles of chemotherapy. Pre- and posttreatment radionuclide ejection fractions were 65 and 45%, respectively; this patient had a posttreatment endomyocardial biopsy score of 1 (damage to <5% of myocytes). One additional patient at this dose level had an asymptomatic biopsy score of 1, with a decrease in ejection fraction from 62 to 43%; this recovered to 58% 5 months after completion of chemotherapy. Six additional patients treated at lower dose levels had abnormal posttreatment endomyocardial biopsies without abnormal posttreatment ejection fractions. Nine patients received only one cycle of chemotherapy: five patients due to decreased cardiac ejection fraction following cycle 1 (two of these patients had normal endomyocardial biopsies, and two patients had biopsy scores of 1); one patient secondary to tumor progression following cycle one; one patient due to persistently detectable Clostridium difficile toxin in the stool; one patient refused cycle two; and one patient died following cycle one of complications related to sepsis. A single patient experienced a grand mal seizure associated with orthostatic hypotension, which was considered the dose-limiting toxicity. The median duration (over two cycles) of granulocytopenia (absolute granulocyte count <500/microliter) at the maximally tolerated dose level of 150 mg/m2 was 8.5 days (range, 5-13 days), and the median duration of thrombocytopenia (platelets <20,000/microliter) was 2.5 days (range, 0-9 days). The median duration of hospitalization including chemotherapy administration was 23 days (range, 19-36 days). Other toxicities included stomatitis, fever, diarrhea, and emesis. One patient developed acute leukemia 54 months posttreatment. We conclude that two courses of high-dose cyclophosphamide and doxorubicin using granulocyte colony-stimulating factor are feasible and safe with tolerable myocardial toxicity as evidenced by serial endomyocardial biopsies. The dose-limiting toxicity encountered was a grand mal seizure. The recommended Phase II dose is doxorubicin 150 mg/m2 administered as a 96-h infusion on days 1-4, with cyclophosphamide 4. 2 g/m2 on day 5 and G-CSF 5 microgram/kg/day started on day 6 and administered until the total WBC is above 10,000/microliter for three consecutive days.","['Morgan, R J Jr', 'Doroshow, J H', 'Venkataraman, K', 'Chang, K', 'Raschko, J', 'Somlo, G', 'Leong, L', 'Tetef, M', 'Shibata, S', 'Hamasaki, V', 'Margolin, K', 'Forman, S', 'Akman, S', 'Coluzzi, P', 'Ahn, C', 'Weiss, L', 'Gadgil, U', 'Harrison, J']","['Morgan RJ Jr', 'Doroshow JH', 'Venkataraman K', 'Chang K', 'Raschko J', 'Somlo G', 'Leong L', 'Tetef M', 'Shibata S', 'Hamasaki V', 'Margolin K', 'Forman S', 'Akman S', 'Coluzzi P', 'Ahn C', 'Weiss L', 'Gadgil U', 'Harrison J']","['Department of Medical Oncology, City of Hope National Medical Center, Duarte, California 91010, USA.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Clinical Trial, Phase II', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,"['0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'PVI5M0M1GW (Filgrastim)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Breast Neoplasms/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Cyclophosphamide/administration & dosage/*adverse effects', 'Doxorubicin/administration & dosage/*adverse effects', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Female', 'Filgrastim', 'Gated Blood-Pool Imaging', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/*therapeutic use', 'Heart/diagnostic imaging/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Infusions, Intravenous', 'Lymphatic Metastasis', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Recombinant Proteins']",1998/11/17 03:02,2001/03/28 10:01,['1998/11/17 03:02'],"['1998/11/17 03:02 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1998/11/17 03:02 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 1997 Dec;3(12 Pt 1):2337-45.,['CA 33572/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

At a nontoxic dose level, DTctGMCSF therapy was superior to the standard chemotherapeutic agents 1-beta-D-arabinofuranosylcytosine and Adriamycin, resulting in 60% long-term event-free survival of severe combined immunodeficient mice challenged with an otherwise invariably fatal cell dose of the human HL-60 myeloid leukemia. Notably, systemic exposure levels of DTctGMCSF, which were found to be therapeutic in the severe combined immunodeficient mouse xenograft model of human HL-60 myeloid leukemia, could be achieved in cynomolgus monkeys without any significant nonhematological toxicities.

However, the frequency and significance of p16 abnormalities in multiple myeloma (MM) and the more aggressive phase of plasma cell leukemia (PCL) have not been well defined. Accordingly, the goal of this study was to define the expression and function of p16 in fresh samples of MM and PCL. We found that p16 protein was highly expressed in primary MM cells, although it was undetectable in fresh samples of PCL. Additionally, p16 protein was also absent in four of four MM-derived cell lines. To determine the mechanism for p16 underexpression in PCL and MM-derived cell lines, we performed PCR analysis to evaluate both gene deletion and the presence of methylation. Interestingly, the p16 gene was present and methylated in all patient PCL cells and MM cell lines, whereas it was unmethylated in patient MM cells and normal B cells. Furthermore, treatment with the demethylating agent 5-deoxyazacytidine or p16 retrofection restored p16 protein expression and induced G1 growth arrest in patient PCL cells and MM cell lines. These results suggest that inactivation of the p16 gene by methylation may be associated with decreased growth control and the development of PCL in a subset of patients with MM.","['Urashima, M', 'Teoh, G', 'Ogata, A', 'Chauhan, D', 'Treon, S P', 'Sugimoto, Y', 'Kaihara, C', 'Matsuzaki, M', 'Hoshi, Y', 'DeCaprio, J A', 'Anderson, K C']","['Urashima M', 'Teoh G', 'Ogata A', 'Chauhan D', 'Treon SP', 'Sugimoto Y', 'Kaihara C', 'Matsuzaki M', 'Hoshi Y', 'DeCaprio JA', 'Anderson KC']","['Divisions of Hematologic Malignancies, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, Massachusetts 02215, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,"['0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p16)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)']",IM,"['B-Lymphocytes/metabolism/pathology', 'Bone Marrow/metabolism/pathology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p16/*genetics/*metabolism', 'DNA Methylation', 'DNA, Neoplasm/metabolism', '*Genes, p16', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Plasma Cell/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Multiple Myeloma/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1998/11/17 00:00,1998/11/17 00:01,['1998/11/17 00:00'],"['1998/11/17 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/11/17 00:01 [medline]', '1998/11/17 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 1997 Nov;3(11):2173-9.,['CA 50947/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A Phase I trial in patients with refractory hematological malignancies demonstrated that the clinical responses to this agent were directly related to the peak levels of ara-G 5'-triphosphate (ara-GTP) in target cells. The aim of the present study was to develop and test strategies to increase intracellular accumulation of ara-GTP in primary human leukemia cells of myeloid and B-lymphoid origin. Three strategies were tested. First, incubations with 100 microM ara-G for 4 h produced a linear median accumulation rate of 19 microM/h (range, 2-45 microM/h; n = 15) in lymphoid leukemia cells and 16 microM/h (range, 0.5-41 microM/h; n = 11) in myeloid leukemia cells. Saturation of ara-GTP accumulation was achieved only after 6-8 h exposure in both lymphoid and myeloid leukemia cells, suggesting a rationale for prolonged infusion. Second, a dose-dependent increase in ara-GTP accumulation was observed with incubations of 10-300 microM ara-G for 3 h. Hence, dosing regimens that achieve high plasma levels of ara-G during therapy may increase cellular levels of ara-GTP. Finally, a biochemical modulation approach using in vitro incubation of leukemia cells with 10 microM 9-beta-D-arabinofuranosyl-2-fluoroadenine for 3 h, followed by either 50 or 100 microM ara-G for 4 h, resulted in a statistically significant median 1.3-fold (range, 1.1-9.0-fold; P = 0.034) and 1. 8-fold (range, 0.9-10.6 fold; P = 0.018) increase in ara-GTP compared to cells incubated with ara-G alone. Extension of these studies to ex vivo incubations confirmed our in vitro findings.

Notably, AMD473 has shown activity in vitro in human carcinoma cells that have acquired cisplatin resistance due to reduced drug transport (41M/41McisR) or enhanced DNA repair/increased tolerance of platinum-DNA adducts (CH1/CH1cisR). In this study, we show that AMD473, at its maximum tolerated dose of 35-40 mg/kg i.p. administration, produced marked in vivo antitumor activity against a variety of murine (ADJ/PC6 plasmacytoma, L1210 leukemia) and human ovarian carcinoma xenograft models, including several possessing acquired resistance to cisplatin [ADJ/PC6cisR, L1210cisR, CH1cisR, and HX110 (carboplatin-resistant)]. In the ADJ/PC6 model, an increased therapeutic index was noted following oral as opposed to i. p. administration. In a head-to-head comparison using CH1cisR xenografts and equitoxic doses (q7dx4 schedule), comparative growth delays were as follows: AMD473, 34 days; cisplatin, 10.4 days; carboplatin, 6.4 days; and JM216 (p.o. administration), 3.5 days (in a previous experiment, the trans-platinum complex JM335 induced a growth delay of 5.4 days against this model). In this model, oral activity was also noted with a growth delay of 34 days at 400 mg/kg every 7 days (total of four doses). In addition, AMD473 showed promising activity against CH1 xenografts that had regrown following initial treatment with cisplatin (additional growth delay of 30 days over that observed for retreatment with cisplatin). Across the whole panel of cisplatin-sensitive to cisplatin-resistant human ovarian carcinoma xenografts, AMD473 showed improved or at least comparable activity to that observed for an equitoxic dose (4 mg/kg) and schedule of cisplatin. Platinum pharmacokinetics showed that following i.v. administration of 20 mg/kg AMD473 in saline to Balb/c- mice bearing murine plasmacytoma (ADJ/PC6), a biexponential decay was observed in the plasma with a rapid distribution t1/2alpha of 24 min followed by a slow elimination t1/2beta of 44 h. Platinum accumulated in various organs with platinum tissue to plasma area under the curve ratios of 8.6 for liver and kidney, 5.7 for spleen, 3.7 for heart, 5.2 for lung, and 5 for tumor. The plasma and tissue concentration time curve following i.p. administration was similar to that observed following i.v. administration, with a bioavailability of 89%. When AMD473 was given p.o., the platinum absorption was rapid (K01 of 30 min) and the bioavailability was 40%. A less than proportional increase in area under the curve and Cmax was noted in tissue, plasma, and plasma ultrafiltrate following increasing oral doses of AMD473. In vitro, with AMD473, the rate of binding to different plasma proteins was approximately half of that of cisplatin. Following administration of 45 mg/kg i.p. in oil, 33% of the administered platinum was eliminated in the urine after 24 h, and 40% was eliminated after 72 h. Fecal recovery represented 13% of the administered dose after 3 days. Similar results were observed following oral and i.v. administration of 20 mg/kg, but significantly more was excreted in the feces (over 50% of the administered dose) following oral administration of 400 mg/kg, showing that absorption might be a limiting factor by this route of administration. The dose-limiting toxicity for AMD473 in mice was myelosuppression, and no renal toxicity was observed. The promising antitumor activity of AMD473, together with its lack of nephrotoxicity and favorable pharmacokinetic profile, suggests that AMD473 is a good candidate for clinical development.

After pulse-exposure to N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea (EtNU), the initial amount of SSBs (t0 SCGE values) and the time periods required to reduce DNA damage by 50% (t50% SCGE values) were determined in nuclear DNA of individual cells. The t0 SCGE and t50% SCGE values varied interindividually between CLL specimens by factors of 16.6 and 8.2, respectively. Regarding cell-to-cell variation, no major subpopulations with significantly different DNA repair capacities were observed in cell specimens from a given patient. In addition, a monoclonal antibody-based immunocytological assay was used to determine the elimination kinetics for the cytotoxic alkylation product O6-ethylguanine from nuclear DNA. A strong correlation was observed between the relative times for SSB repair and the elimination of O6-ethylguanine from nuclear DNA. Because SCGE and immunocytological assay measure different steps of DNA repair, this observation suggests coordinated regulation of the respective repair pathways. With regard to chemosensitivity profiles, a ""fast"" repair phenotype corresponded to enhanced in vitro resistance to EtNU, 1,3-bis(2-chloroethyl)-1-nitrosourea, or chlorambucil. Accelerated SSB repair and pronounced in vitro resistance to chlorambucil, 1,3-bis(2-chloroethyl)-1-nitrosourea, and EtNU were found in lymphocytes from CLL patients nonresponsive to chemotherapy with alkylating agents. Distinct DNA repair processes thus mediate resistance to alkylating agents in CLL lymphocytes.","['Muller, M R', 'Buschfort, C', 'Thomale, J', 'Lensing, C', 'Rajewsky, M F', 'Seeber, S']","['Muller MR', 'Buschfort C', 'Thomale J', 'Lensing C', 'Rajewsky MF', 'Seeber S']","['Department of Internal Medicine (Cancer Research) and Institute of Cell Biology (Cancer Research), West German Cancer Center Essen, University of Essen Medical School, D-45122 Essen, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '18D0SL7309 (Chlorambucil)', '51866-19-4 (6-ethylguanine)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '5Z93L87A1R (Guanine)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'P8M1T4190R (Ethylnitrosourea)', 'U68WG3173Y (Carmustine)', 'VB0R961HZT (Prednisone)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating/*toxicity', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Carmustine/*toxicity', 'Cell Nucleus/drug effects', 'Chlorambucil/*toxicity', 'Cyclophosphamide/administration & dosage', '*DNA Damage', '*DNA Repair', 'DNA, Neoplasm/blood/chemistry', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Ethylnitrosourea/*toxicity', 'Guanine/analogs & derivatives/analysis', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*blood/drug therapy', 'Lymphocytes/*drug effects/pathology', 'Prednisone/administration & dosage', 'Vincristine/administration & dosage']",1998/11/17 00:00,1998/11/17 00:01,['1998/11/17 00:00'],"['1998/11/17 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/11/17 00:01 [medline]', '1998/11/17 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 1997 Nov;3(11):2055-61.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although the mechanism of action is unknown, both compounds demonstrated a similar spectrum of solid tumor selectivity. 232759 was selected for clinical development because it showed no hepatotoxicity in preliminary studies, whereas 183577 showed hepatotoxicity but only at the maximum tolerated dose (MTD). The limiting toxicity for the clinical candidate was myelosuppression in preliminary studies. Plasma and tissue drug levels, as well as protein binding, were studied in mice using optimal administration times at the MTD for each drug (for 183577, this was a 4-h infusion at 1350 mg/m2 and for 232759, it was a 5-min injection at 240 mg/m2), as well as at one-half the MTD for the clinical candidate. The drugs were 96-100% bound by plasma proteins. The peak drug concentrations, half-life, and area under the concentration-time curve in plasma for 183577 were 3483 ng/ml, 465 min, and 2018 microgram/ml. min, respectively. The peak drug concentration, half-life, and area under the concentration-time curve in plasma for 232759 were 5257 ng/ml, 44 min, and 276 microgram/ml. min, respectively, at the MTD and 2810 ng/ml, 40 min, and 110 microgram/ml. min at one-half the MTD. In all instances of simultaneous measurements, drug concentrations were equal or higher in tissues than they were in plasma. Unlike the plasma and kidney concentrations of 183577, the liver concentrations did not show a declining trend over the 8-h observation period. Declines in plasma, liver, kidney, and tumor levels of 232759 were detected over the 8-h observation period. The sustained high 183577 concentration in liver is believed to be responsible for its prolonged half-life and hepatotoxicity. Evidence for metabolism of the parent drugs was based on the finding of additional peaks on the high-pressure liquid chromatography tracings. Future studies will focus on identification and antitumor studies of these presumed metabolites in hopes of a better understanding of the solid tumor activity profiles and toxic effects of these compounds.","['Foster, B J', 'Wiegand, R A', 'Pugh, S', 'LoRusso, P M', 'Rake, J', 'Corbett, T H']","['Foster BJ', 'Wiegand RA', 'Pugh S', 'LoRusso PM', 'Rake J', 'Corbett TH']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Division of Hematology and Oncology, Wayne State University School of Medicine, Detroit, Michigan 48202-0188, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (BCN 183577)', '0 (Blood Proteins)', '0 (Sulfonamides)', '0 (Thioxanthenes)', '146537-07-7 (WIN 33377)']",IM,"['Adenocarcinoma/blood/*metabolism', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/blood/*pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use', 'Blood Proteins/metabolism', 'Colonic Neoplasms/blood/*metabolism', 'Female', 'Half-Life', 'Kidney/metabolism', 'Leukemia L1210/blood/metabolism', 'Liver/metabolism', 'Metabolic Clearance Rate', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred Strains', 'Sulfonamides/blood/*pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use', 'Thioxanthenes/blood/*pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use', 'Tissue Distribution']",1998/11/17 00:00,1998/11/17 00:01,['1998/11/17 00:00'],"['1998/11/17 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/11/17 00:01 [medline]', '1998/11/17 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 1997 Nov;3(11):2047-53.,"['CA46460/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA46560-04S1/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although a number of factors affect MDR1 gene expression, the genetic events that ""switch on"" the human MDR1 gene in tumor cells that were previously P-glycoprotein negative have remained elusive. Here, we report evidence that the methylation status of the human MDR1 promoter may serve as a basis for this ""switch."" Based on Southern analysis using methylation-sensitive and methylation-insensitive restriction enzymes, a tight correlation was found between MDR phenotype and demethylation of the 5' region of the MDR1 gene in a human T cell leukemia cell line. Similar results were obtained from the analysis of P-glycoprotein-positive and P-glycoprotein-negative samples of chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Treatment of the cell lines with the demethylating agent 5'-azadeoxycytidine altered the methylation pattern of the MDR1 promoter in P-glycoprotein-negative cells to resemble that of P-glycoprotein-positive cells and activated the promoter such that MDR1 mRNA was now detectable. Treatment also resulted in an increased resistance to epirubicin and decreased daunomycin accumulation, both of which were reversible by verapamil, a characteristic of the classical MDR phenotype in cells expressing P-glycoprotein. These results suggest that the MDR phenotype may be acquired as a result of changes in methylation of the MDR1 promoter.","['Kantharidis, P', 'El-Osta, A', 'deSilva, M', 'Wall, D M', 'Hu, X F', 'Slater, A', 'Nadalin, G', 'Parkin, J D', 'Zalcberg, J R']","['Kantharidis P', 'El-Osta A', 'deSilva M', 'Wall DM', 'Hu XF', 'Slater A', 'Nadalin G', 'Parkin JD', 'Zalcberg JR']","['Department of Medical Oncology, Austin Repatriation Medical Centre, West Heidelberg 3081, Victoria, Australia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Dinucleoside Phosphates)', ""2382-65-2 (cytidylyl-3'-5'-guanosine)"", '3Z8479ZZ5X (Epirubicin)', '776B62CQ27 (Decitabine)', 'CJ0O37KU29 (Verapamil)', 'M801H13NRU (Azacitidine)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/*genetics', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/toxicity', 'Azacitidine/analogs & derivatives/toxicity', 'Blotting, Southern', 'DNA Methylation', 'Daunorubicin/toxicity', 'Decitabine', 'Dinucleoside Phosphates/analysis', 'Drug Resistance, Multiple/*genetics', 'Epirubicin/toxicity', 'Exons', 'Humans', 'Introns', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/genetics', 'Leukemia, T-Cell', '*Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Restriction Mapping', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Verapamil/pharmacology']",1998/11/17 00:00,1998/11/17 00:01,['1998/11/17 00:00'],"['1998/11/17 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/11/17 00:01 [medline]', '1998/11/17 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 1997 Nov;3(11):2025-32.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In contrast to IF, where the majority of metabolites was measured in the CSF, no child receiving CP had detectable metabolites. Children receiving dexamethasone had lower concentrations of CP in the CSF (P = 0.04). The CSF:plasma ratio for isophosphoramide mustard was greater than that for either parent drug or any other metabolite.

Renal cell carcinoma is a disease known to demonstrate a high degree of intrinsic chemotherapy drug resistance, and this has been shown to be related to intrinsic overexpression of P-glycoprotein. Cyclosporine A and tamoxifen have been shown to reverse multidrug resistance in renal cell carcinoma cell lines in vitro. Phase I studies have defined appropriate doses of cyclosporine A and tamoxifen that can be combined with continuous-infusion vinblastine and safely achieve serum levels associated in vitro with resistance reversal. A randomized Phase II study was carried out by the Cancer and Leukemia Group B to evaluate the potential of high doses of cyclosporine A or tamoxifen to modulate clinical vinblastine resistance in patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma. Patients were treated initially with continuous-infusion vinblastine alone (1.2 mg/m2/day for 4 days or 1.5 mg/m2/day for 5 days); patients with stable or progressive disease were then treated with the same vinblastine regimen, combined with a high-dose regimen of either cyclosporine A (12.5 mg/kg/day for 5 days) or tamoxifen (400 mg/m2 as a loading dose and 300 mg/m2/day for 13 days). Sixty-three patients were randomized to each arm. Eighty patients on both arms were evaluable for response to vinblastine alone; of these, only one patient achieved a partial response. Thirty-three patients went on to be treated with vinblastine and high-dose cyclosporine A. No responses were observed, although four patients with progressive disease on prior vinblastine achieved stabilization of disease after cyclosporine A was added. Addition of cyclosporine resulted in more leukopenia (5% versus 25%) and in transient hyperbilirubinemia (24%) and neurocortical changes (11%). No significant azotemia was observed. Thirty-five patients received high-dose tamoxifen with continuous-infusion vinblastine. One complete remission was seen in a patient who had stable disease only with prior vinblastine alone; no other responses were observed. Leukopenia was not more severe with the addition of tamoxifen to vinblastine, nor was hyperbilirubinemia observed. However, 9% of patients developed transient ataxia with or without neurocortical changes as a result of high-dose tamoxifen therapy, and 11% developed phlebitis. We conclude that advanced renal cell carcinoma is a highly chemoresistant tumor, that continuous-infusion vinblastine has no appreciable activity in the therapy of this disease, and that addition of high doses of cyclosporine A or tamoxifen was not able to modulate this resistance in these patients.

We have studied the impact of these two agents on lineage- and differentiation stage-specific antigen expression, proliferation, apoptosis, and clonogenic cell survival in primary cultures of bone marrow samples from patients with myeloid neoplasms at presentation and in remission and from normal volunteers. PB inhibited the proliferation of primary acute myeloid leukemia cells in suspension culture with an ID50 of 6.6 mM, similar to its ED50 in cell lines. At higher doses (>/=5 mM), PB also induced apoptosis. PB inhibited clonogenic leukemia cell growth with a median ID50 of less than 2 mM; however, colony-forming units-granulocyte/macrophage from patients with myelodysplasia and normal volunteers were inhibited with a similar ID50. In contrast to PB, its metabolite PA had no significant effect on either acute myeloid leukemia proliferation or apoptosis. Expression of the monocytic marker CD14 was increased in monocytic and myelomonocytic leukemias in response to PB, and to a lesser extent, PA. Surprisingly, both agents appeared to increase expression of the progenitor cell antigen CD34, as well as the DR locus of the human leukocyte antigen.

We have reported that cyclosporin A (CsA) can overcome multidrug resistance and improve the efficacy of etoposide in a murine model of drug-sensitive leukemia. The combination of CsA and paclitaxel (PCL) was also significantly superior to either drug alone against murine P388 (sensitive) and L1210 (resistant) leukemia. Lung cancer cells provide an ideal model system to study this phenomenon because both de novo and acquired drug resistance occur. Standard chemotherapy for advanced lung cancer is poorly effective, and although PCL is one of the most active new agents for this disease, responses occur in only 20% of patients. In vitro, CsA significantly enhanced the efficacy of PCL against lung (Lu-CSF-1 and 3LL) and oropharyngeal (CSCC-20) cancer cell lines. The combination also produced an increase in expression of interleukin 1beta, a cytokine known to inhibit the growth of Lu-CSF-1 cells. CsA alone had little or no antiproliferative activity in vitro and did not alter PCL transport. These results indicate that the activity of chemotherapy modulators may extend beyond mitigation of drug resistance to enhancement of therapeutic efficacy against drug-sensitive tumor cells in vitro and in vivo.","['Ross, H J', 'Canada, A L', 'Slater, L M']","['Ross HJ', 'Canada AL', 'Slater LM']","['Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology/Oncology, University of California, Irvine, California 92717, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Growth Substances)', '0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)', '6D4M1DAL6O (cremophor EL)', '83HN0GTJ6D (Cyclosporine)', 'P88XT4IS4D (Paclitaxel)', 'PDC6A3C0OX (Glycerol)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/*therapeutic use', 'Cyclosporine/*therapeutic use', 'Cytokines/biosynthesis', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Drug Resistance, Multiple', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Drug Synergism', 'Glycerol/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Growth Substances/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy/immunology/mortality', 'Mice', 'Paclitaxel/*therapeutic use', 'Respiratory Tract Neoplasms/*drug therapy/immunology', 'Survival Rate', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1997/01/01 00:00,1998/11/17 00:01,['1997/01/01 00:00'],"['1997/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/11/17 00:01 [medline]', '1997/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 1997 Jan;3(1):57-62.,['CA01660/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We report here our quantitative data on the reactions of thiocyanate ion with CLB in various fluid matrixes at 37 degreesC. The rate of decomposition of 1 is zero-order with respect to SCN- concentration up to 100 mM. However, thiocyanate ion reacts ca. 18 300 times faster than water with the aziridinium ion derived from 1 at neutral and acidic pH. When the SCN- concentration was greater than 10 mM, practically no N,N-bis(2-hydroxyethyl)-p-aminophenylbutyric acid, 4, the product of chlorambucil hydrolysis, could be detected. Thiocyanate ion also effectively overcompensates for the rate retardation caused by Cl-; 10 mM SCN- is enough to decrease the effect of 0.5 M chloride ion to one-half.

When these receptors are activated by alpha-thrombin or by thrombin receptor-activating peptide, an elevation in cytosolic Ca2+ concentration develops that is accompanied by hyperpolarization of the plasma membrane. This transitory phase of hyperpolarization is primarily mediated by inwardly rectifying, Ca2+-activated K+ channels that have an inward conductance of approximately 24 pS. In cell-attached patches the channels open within seconds after superfusion of the cell with thrombin receptor-activating peptide. In inside-out patches, perfusion of submicromolar Ca2+ onto the cytosolic surface of the membrane is sufficient to activate the channels. In outside-out patches, channel opening can be blocked by nanomolar concentrations of charybdotoxin. The function of these intermediate-sized inwardly rectifying, Ca2+-activated K+ channels has not been established; however, by analogy with other cell systems, they may serve to regulate cell volume during cellular activation or to increase the electromotive drive that sustains Na+ and/or Ca2+ influx through ligand-gated cation channels.","['Sullivan, R', 'Koliwad, S K', 'Kunze, D L']","['Sullivan R', 'Koliwad SK', 'Kunze DL']","['Research Service, Houston Veterans Affairs Medical Center, and Departments of Medicine and of Molecular Physiology and Biophysics, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas 77030, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Am J Physiol,The American journal of physiology,0370511,"['0 (Peptide Fragments)', '0 (Potassium Channels)', '0 (Potassium Channels, Inwardly Rectifying)', '0 (Receptors, Thrombin)', '115422-61-2 (Charybdotoxin)', '137339-65-2 (thrombin receptor peptide (42-55))', 'EC 3.4.21.5 (Thrombin)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Calcium/*metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Membrane/drug effects/physiology', 'Cell Polarity/*physiology', 'Charybdotoxin/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Membrane Potentials/drug effects/physiology', 'Peptide Fragments/pharmacology', 'Potassium Channels/drug effects/*physiology', '*Potassium Channels, Inwardly Rectifying', 'Receptors, Thrombin/*physiology', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects/physiology', 'Thrombin/pharmacology/*physiology']",1998/11/14 00:00,1998/11/14 00:01,['1998/11/14 00:00'],"['1998/11/14 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/11/14 00:01 [medline]', '1998/11/14 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1152/ajpcell.1998.275.5.C1342 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Physiol. 1998 Nov;275(5):C1342-8. doi: 10.1152/ajpcell.1998.275.5.C1342.,['HL-45880/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,10.1152/ajpcell.1998.275.5.C1342 [doi]

This cytolytic receptor and its associated ion channel are Ca2+ (and Ba2+) selective but also pass molecules up to the size of ethidium cation (314 Da). RT-PCR showed identity between lymphocyte P2Z and the hP2X7 gene recently cloned from human monocytes. When human leukemic B lymphocytes were incubated with ATP and 133Ba2+, an immediate influx of isotope occurred. It was augmented by 45% when ATP was added 10 min before isotope. Time-resolved flow cytometry was used to examine kinetics of ethidium uptake in cells incubated with BzATP or the partial agonists ATP, 2-methylthioadenosine 5'-triphosphate, or adenosine 5'-O-(3-thiotriphosphate). Maximally effective concentrations of BzATP (50 microM) induced immediate uptake of ethidium at a rate linear with time. In contrast, a delay was observed (30 s) before ethidium uptake commenced after addition of maximally effective ATP concentrations (500 microM) at 37 degreesC, and the delay was longer at 24 degreesC. ATP addition 2-10 min before ethidium abolished the delay. The delay was longer with other partial agonists and inversely related to maximal flux produced by agonist. A delay was also observed for submaximal BzATP concentrations (10-20 microM). P2Z/P2X7 inhibitors, KN-62 and 5-(N, N-hexamethylene)-amiloride, reduced the rate of agonist-induced ethidium uptake and lengthened the delay. The results support a model in which agonists for P2Z/P2X7 receptor mediate an immediate channel opening allowing passage of small inorganic cations, followed by a slow further permeability increase allowing passage of larger permeant cations like ethidium. The rate of the second step depends on time and temperature and the efficacy and concentration of agonist and is slowed by antagonists, suggesting it depends on the fraction of P2Z/P2X7 channels held in the initial open state.","['Wiley, J S', 'Gargett, C E', 'Zhang, W', 'Snook, M B', 'Jamieson, G P']","['Wiley JS', 'Gargett CE', 'Zhang W', 'Snook MB', 'Jamieson GP']","['Sydney University Department of Medicine, Nepean Hospital, Penrith, New South Wales 2750, Australia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Am J Physiol,The American journal of physiology,0370511,"['0 (P2RX7 protein, human)', '0 (Purinergic P2 Receptor Agonists)', '0 (Purinergic P2 Receptor Antagonists)', '0 (Receptors, Purinergic P2)', '0 (Receptors, Purinergic P2X7)', '0 (Thionucleotides)', '24GP945V5T (Barium)', ""35094-46-3 (adenosine 5'-O-(3-thiotriphosphate))"", ""4P5DXU1F8Q (3'-O-(4-benzoyl)benzoyladenosine 5'-triphosphate)"", '8L70Q75FXE (Adenosine Triphosphate)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)', 'Y37441OBL1 (2-methylthio-ATP)']",IM,"['Adenosine Triphosphate/*analogs & derivatives/*pharmacology', 'B-Lymphocytes/drug effects/*physiology', 'Barium/metabolism', 'Calcium/metabolism', 'Cell Membrane Permeability', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell', 'Liver/drug effects/*physiology', 'Macrophages/drug effects/*physiology', 'Monocytes/drug effects/*physiology', 'Purinergic P2 Receptor Agonists', 'Purinergic P2 Receptor Antagonists', 'Receptors, Purinergic P2/genetics/*physiology', 'Receptors, Purinergic P2X7', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Thionucleotides/pharmacology']",1998/11/14 00:00,1998/11/14 00:01,['1998/11/14 00:00'],"['1998/11/14 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/11/14 00:01 [medline]', '1998/11/14 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1152/ajpcell.1998.275.5.C1224 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Physiol. 1998 Nov;275(5):C1224-31. doi: 10.1152/ajpcell.1998.275.5.C1224.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,10.1152/ajpcell.1998.275.5.C1224 [doi]

With six primer sets specific to either HTLV-1-Simian T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (STLV-1) or HTLV-2 and encompassing long terminal repeat (LTR), gag, pol, env, and tax sequences, polymerase chain reaction was performed on genomic DNA from peripheral blood mononuclear cells of 18 animals, and the presence of HTLV-1-STLV-1-related viruses was determined in 13 seropositive and three seroindeterminate animals but not in the two HTLV seronegative individuals. Proviral DNA sequences from env (522 bp), pol (120 bp), and complete (755 bp) or partial (514 bp) LTR were determined for three STLV-1-infected P. ursinus and one P. anubis. Comparative and phylogenetic analyses revealed that P. anubis (Pan-486) sequence clusters with one (Pan-1621) of two previously described P. anubis STLV-1. Likewise, P. ursinus viruses (Pur-529, Pur-539, and Pur-543) form a distinct group, different from all known HTLV-1 but closely affiliated with two STLV-1 strains from South African vervets (Cercopithecus aethiops pygerythrus). This study, reporting the first STLV-1 sequences from wild-caught P. ursinus and P. anubis, corroborates the hypothesis of cross-species transmissions of STLV-1 in the wild. Further, phylogenetic analyses indicate that the known HTLV-1 strains do not share a common origin with nonhuman primates STLV in South Africa.","['Mahieux, R', 'Pecon-Slattery, J', 'Chen, G M', 'Gessain, A']","['Mahieux R', 'Pecon-Slattery J', 'Chen GM', 'Gessain A']","['Departement des Retrovirus, Institut Pasteur, 28 rue du Dr. Roux, Paris, Cedex 15, 75724, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Virology,Virology,0110674,"['0 (DNA Probes)', '0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (Gene Products, env)', '0 (Gene Products, gag)', '0 (Gene Products, pol)', '0 (Gene Products, tax)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Animals, Wild/*virology', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'DNA Probes', 'DNA, Viral/blood', 'Deltaretrovirus Infections/transmission/*veterinary/virology', '*Evolution, Molecular', 'Gene Products, env/genetics', 'Gene Products, gag/genetics', 'Gene Products, pol/genetics', 'Gene Products, tax/genetics', 'Kenya', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/virology', 'Male', 'Monkey Diseases/transmission/*virology', 'Papio/*virology', 'Phylogeny', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA', 'Simian T-lymphotropic virus 1/*genetics/immunology', 'South Africa', 'Terminal Repeat Sequences/genetics']",1998/11/14 00:00,1998/11/14 00:01,['1998/11/14 00:00'],"['1998/11/14 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/11/14 00:01 [medline]', '1998/11/14 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0042-6822(98)99377-1 [pii]', '10.1006/viro.1998.9377 [doi]']",ppublish,Virology. 1998 Nov 10;251(1):71-84. doi: 10.1006/viro.1998.9377.,,,,,,['Copyright 1998 Academic Press.'],"['GENBANK/AF035538', 'GENBANK/AF035539', 'GENBANK/AF035540', 'GENBANK/AF035541', 'GENBANK/AF035542', 'GENBANK/AF035543', 'GENBANK/AF035544', 'GENBANK/AF035545', 'GENBANK/AF038426', 'GENBANK/AF038427', 'GENBANK/AF038428', 'GENBANK/AF038429']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Our current studies have focused on the activation of STATs 1 and 3 by leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), oncostatin-M (OSM), and interferon-gamma (IFNgamma) in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. IFNgamma is shown to be a potent activator of STAT 1 as indicated by both tyrosine phosphorylation and nuclear translocation. However, LIF and OSM, which are potent inducers of STAT 3, are less potent activators of STAT 1 as measured by both tyrosine phosphorylation and nuclear translocation. Both STATs 1 and 3 were translocated to the nucleus in a time-dependent fashion following LIF treatment. In addition, IFNgamma resulted in a time- and dose-dependent effect on STATs 1 and 3 nuclear translocation. Growth hormone, a potent activator of STATs 5A and 5B, had a minimal effect on STAT 1 and STAT 3 tyrosine phosphorylation. Preincubation with either insulin or growth hormone had no detectable effects on the tyrosine phosphorylation or nuclear translocation of STATs 1 and 3 induced by LIF, OSM, or IFNgamma. The effects of LIF and IFNgamma on STAT 1 and 3 tyrosine phosphorylation and nuclear translocation were confirmed in native rat adipocytes. In 3T3-L1 adipocytes, a low level of serine phosphorylation of STAT 3 on residue 727 was observed and was markedly enhanced by insulin, LIF, or OSM. This increase in STAT 3 Ser727 phosphorylation was dependent upon the activation of MAPK, since the MAPK kinase inhibitor (PD98059) reduced STAT 3 Ser727 phosphorylation to basal levels. The inhibition of MAPK had no effect on the ability of STATs 1 and 3 to be tyrosine-phosphorylated or translocate to the nucleus. These studies demonstrate the highly specific and quantitative activation of STATs 1 and 3 by LIF, OSM, and IFNgamma in adipocytes and indicate that STAT 3 is a substrate for MAPK in adipocytes.","['Stephens, J M', 'Lumpkin, S J', 'Fishman, J B']","['Stephens JM', 'Lumpkin SJ', 'Fishman JB']","['Department of Biological Sciences, Louisiana State University, Baton Rouge, Louisiana 70803, USA. jsteph1@unix1.sncc.lsu.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Insulin)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Osm protein, mouse)', '0 (Peptides)', '0 (STAT1 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Stat1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Stat3 protein, mouse)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '106956-32-5 (Oncostatin M)', '42HK56048U (Tyrosine)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)', '9002-72-6 (Growth Hormone)', 'EC 2.7.11.17 (Calcium-Calmodulin-Dependent Protein Kinases)']",IM,"['3T3 Cells', 'Adipocytes/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Animals', 'Biological Transport', 'Calcium-Calmodulin-Dependent Protein Kinases/metabolism', 'Cell Nucleus/metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/metabolism', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Growth Hormone/pharmacology', 'Growth Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Insulin/pharmacology', 'Interferon-gamma/*pharmacology', '*Interleukin-6', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Lymphokines/*pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Oncostatin M', 'Peptides/*pharmacology', 'Phosphorylation', 'STAT1 Transcription Factor', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor', 'Signal Transduction', 'Time Factors', 'Trans-Activators/*metabolism', 'Tyrosine/metabolism']",1998/11/13 00:00,1998/11/13 00:01,['1998/11/13 00:00'],"['1998/11/13 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/11/13 00:01 [medline]', '1998/11/13 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1074/jbc.273.47.31408 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(19)59170-0 [pii]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1998 Nov 20;273(47):31408-16. doi: 10.1074/jbc.273.47.31408.,['R29DK52968-01/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We identified a cDNA encoding p22 HBP, and sequence analysis revealed that p22 HBP comprises 190 amino acid residues (Mr 21,063) and has no homology to any other known heme-binding protein. The p22 HBP mRNA (approximately 1.0 kilobases) is ubiquitously expressed in various tissues and is extremely abundant in the liver. cDNA allows for expression of active p22 HBP, with a high affinity for 55Fe-hemin, with a Kd of 26 +/-1.8 nM. The Bmax of hemin binding to p22 HBP was 0.55 +/- 0.021 mol/mol of protein, a value consistent with one heme molecule binding per molecule of protein. The order of potency of different ligands to compete against 55Fe-hemin binding to p22 HBP was hemin = protoporphyrin IX > coproporphyrin III > bilirubin > palmitic acid > all-trans-retinoic acid. Treatment of mouse erythroleukemia (MEL) cells with dimethyl sulfoxide or hemin resulted in an increase in p22 HBP mRNA. The immunoblot analysis showed that p22 HBP increased with time in dimethyl sulfoxide- and hemin-induced MEL cells. Conversely, transfer of antisense oligonucleotides to p22 HBP cDNA resulted in a decrease of p22 HBP in dimethyl sulfoxide-treated MEL cells, and the heme content in these cells decreased to 66-71% of sense oligonucleotides-transferred cells. Thus, this newly identified heme-binding protein, p22 HBP, may be involved in heme utilization for hemoprotein synthesis and even be coupled to hemoglobin synthesis during erythroid differentiation.","['Taketani, S', 'Adachi, Y', 'Kohno, H', 'Ikehara, S', 'Tokunaga, R', 'Ishii, T']","['Taketani S', 'Adachi Y', 'Kohno H', 'Ikehara S', 'Tokunaga R', 'Ishii T']","['Department of Hygiene, Kansai Medical University, Moriguchi, Osaka 570-8506, Japan. taketani@takii.kmu.ac.jp']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Coproporphyrins)', '0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (Heat-Shock Proteins)', '0 (Heme-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Hemeproteins)', '0 (Protoporphyrins)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '42VZT0U6YR (Heme)', '743LRP9S7N (Hemin)', 'EC 1.11.1.- (Peroxidases)', 'EC 1.11.1.15 (Peroxiredoxins)', 'EC 1.11.1.15 (Prdx1 protein, mouse)', 'EC 4.99.1.1 (Ferrochelatase)', 'YOW8V9698H (Dimethyl Sulfoxide)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Carrier Proteins/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Coproporphyrins/metabolism', 'DNA, Complementary/genetics', 'Dimethyl Sulfoxide/pharmacology', 'Erythrocytes/cytology', 'Ferrochelatase', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Heat-Shock Proteins', 'Heme/*metabolism', 'Heme-Binding Proteins', 'Hemeproteins/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Hemin/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/metabolism/pathology', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', '*Peroxidases', 'Peroxiredoxins', 'Protoporphyrins/metabolism', 'Recombinant Proteins/metabolism', 'Sequence Analysis', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid', 'Urine/cytology']",1998/11/13 00:00,1998/11/13 00:01,['1998/11/13 00:00'],"['1998/11/13 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/11/13 00:01 [medline]', '1998/11/13 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1074/jbc.273.47.31388 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(19)59167-0 [pii]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1998 Nov 20;273(47):31388-94. doi: 10.1074/jbc.273.47.31388.,,,,,,,['GENBANK/AB013095'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

The molecular basis for this selectivity is unknown, although psorospermin has been demonstrated to intercalate into DNA and alkylate N7 of guanine. Significantly, the alkylation reactivity of psorospermin at specific sites on DNA increased 25-fold in the presence of topoisomerase II. In addition, psorospermin trapped the topoisomerase II-cleaved complex formation at the same site. These results imply that the efficacy of psorospermin is related to its interaction with the topoisomerase II-DNA complex. Because thermal treatment of (N7 guanine)-DNA adducts leads to DNA strand breakage, we were able to determine the site of alkylation of psorospermin within the topoisomerase II gate site and infer that intercalation takes place at the gate site between base pairs at the +1 and +2 positions. These results provide not only additional mechanistic information on the mode of action of the anticancer agent psorospermin but also structural insights into the design of an additional class of topoisomerase II poisons. Because the alkylation site for psorospermin in the presence of topoisomerase II can be assigned unambiguously and the intercalation site inferred, this drug is a useful probe for other topoisomerase poisons where the sites for interaction are less well defined.","['Kwok, Y', 'Zeng, Q', 'Hurley, L H']","['Kwok Y', 'Zeng Q', 'Hurley LH']","['Drug Dynamics Institute, College of Pharmacy, University of Texas, Austin, TX 78712-1074, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (Xanthenes)', '0 (Xanthones)', '74045-97-9 (psorospermin)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 5.99.1.3 (DNA Topoisomerases, Type II)']",IM,"['Alkylation', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Binding Sites', 'DNA/genetics/*metabolism', 'DNA Topoisomerases, Type II/genetics/*metabolism', 'Drosophila', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Xanthenes/*metabolism', '*Xanthones']",1998/11/13 00:00,1998/11/13 00:01,['1998/11/13 00:00'],"['1998/11/13 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/11/13 00:01 [medline]', '1998/11/13 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1073/pnas.95.23.13531 [doi]'],ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1998 Nov 10;95(23):13531-6. doi: 10.1073/pnas.95.23.13531.,"['R01 CA049751/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R35 CA049751/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-49751/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,PMC24853,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

After ND10 disruption, viral transcription and DNA replication occur in globular nuclear domains called replication compartments. In this report we define four stages of infection by using antibodies to ICP8 (also called SSB and UL29) and the ND10 antigen PML. Immediately after infection, cells contain intact ND10 as detected by staining for PMLs (stage I); within 1 hour, however, ND10 are disrupted and cells begin to exhibit diffuse staining for the major viral DNA binding protein, ICP8 (stage II). After all ND10 have been disrupted, foci which resemble but are not equivalent to ND10 appear, containing both PML and ICP8 (stage III). Cells infected with mutants defective in the helicase-primase or origin binding protein are unable to form stage III foci. Cells infected with a mutant that is null for the polymerase catalytic subunit, however, form stage III-like ICP8 foci which do not contain PML. Thus, stage III foci recruit the cellular PML protein in the presence but not the absence of HSV polymerase. PML was recruited to stage III foci in some but not all cells infected with a mutant defective in the polymerase accessory protein, UL42. Thus, UL42 is not required for the recruitment of PML to viral foci. In wild-type infection, stage III cells are quickly replaced by cells containing replication compartments (stage IV). PML and ICP8 staining are both observed within replication compartments, indicating a potential role for PML in HSV-1 replication. Models for the role of ND10 proteins in the formation of replication compartments are discussed.","['Burkham, J', 'Coen, D M', 'Weller, S K']","['Burkham J', 'Coen DM', 'Weller SK']","['Department of Microbiology, University of Connecticut Health Center, Farmington, Connecticut 06030, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (ICP8 protein, Simplexvirus)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '0 (Viral Proteins)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.7.7 (DNA-Directed DNA Polymerase)']",IM,"['Cell Compartmentation', 'Cell Line', 'DNA, Viral/biosynthesis/genetics', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/metabolism', 'DNA-Directed DNA Polymerase/*metabolism', 'Herpesvirus 1, Human/genetics/pathogenicity/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Microscopy, Fluorescence', 'Models, Biological', 'Mutation', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*metabolism', 'Nuclear Matrix/metabolism/virology', '*Nuclear Proteins', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'Time Factors', 'Transcription Factors/*metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins', 'Viral Proteins/metabolism', 'Virus Replication/*physiology']",1998/11/13 00:00,1998/11/13 00:01,['1998/11/13 00:00'],"['1998/11/13 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/11/13 00:01 [medline]', '1998/11/13 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.72.12.10100-10107.1998 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 1998 Dec;72(12):10100-7. doi: 10.1128/JVI.72.12.10100-10107.1998.,"['R37 AI021747/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'AI19838/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AI021747/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AI019838/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'AI21747/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States']",,PMC110544,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Several fusion determinants have been previously identified in murine leukemia virus (MLV) envelopes, but their functional interrelationships as well as the processes involved in fusion activation upon retroviral receptor recognition remain unelucidated. Despite both structural and functional similarities of their envelope glycoproteins, ecotropic and amphotropic MLVs display two different postbinding properties: (i) while amphotropic MLVs fuse the cells at neutral pH, penetration of ecotropic MLVs is relatively acid pH dependent and (ii) ecotropic envelopes are more efficient than amphotropic envelopes in inducing cell-to-cell fusion and syncytium formation. By exploiting the latter characteristic in the analysis of chimeras of ecotropic and amphotropic MLV envelopes, we show here that substitution of the ecotropic MLV proline-rich region (PRR), located in the SU between the amino-terminal receptor binding domain and the TM-interacting SU carboxy-terminal domains, is sufficient to revert the amphotropic low-fusogenic phenotype into a high-fusogenic one. Furthermore, we have identified potential beta-turns in the PRR that control the stability of SU-TM associations as well as the thresholds required to trigger either cell-to-cell or virus-to-cell fusion. These data, demonstrating that the PRR functions as a signal which induces envelope conformational changes leading to fusion, have enabled us to derive envelopes which can infect cells harboring low levels of available amphotropic receptors.","['Lavillette, D', 'Maurice, M', 'Roche, C', 'Russell, S J', 'Sitbon, M', 'Cosset, F L']","['Lavillette D', 'Maurice M', 'Roche C', 'Russell SJ', 'Sitbon M', 'Cosset FL']","['Centre de Genetique Moleculaire et Cellulaire, CNRS UMR 5534, UCB Lyon-I, 69622 Villeurbanne Cedex, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Receptors, Virus)', '0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)', '9DLQ4CIU6V (Proline)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Binding Sites/genetics', 'Cell Fusion/genetics/physiology', 'Cell Line', 'Chimera/genetics', 'Gene Transfer Techniques', 'Genetic Vectors', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/genetics/*pathogenicity/*physiology', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Proline/chemistry', 'Protein Conformation', 'Protein Structure, Secondary', 'Receptors, Virus/physiology', 'Transfection', 'Viral Envelope Proteins/chemistry/genetics/*physiology']",1998/11/13 00:00,1998/11/13 00:01,['1998/11/13 00:00'],"['1998/11/13 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/11/13 00:01 [medline]', '1998/11/13 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.72.12.9955-9965.1998 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 1998 Dec;72(12):9955-65. doi: 10.1128/JVI.72.12.9955-9965.1998.,,,PMC110509,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The overall structure of the RaLV genome resembles that of other simple, replication-competent retroviruses, but the sequence of the long terminal repeats (LTR) is unique and unrelated to the known retroviruses. Phylogenetically, the RaLV genome appears to be more closely related to the feline leukemia virus group of retroviruses than to the murine leukemia virus group. A remarkable feature of RaLV is that it is capable of transducing a ras proto-oncogene from rat tumor cells in the form of an acutely transforming virus, designated the Rasheed strain of the rat sarcoma virus (RaSV). With the exception of the c-ras sequence, the genomes of both RaLV and RaSV are collinear. The RaSV-encoded oncogene v-Ra-ras expresses a fusion protein with a molecular mass of 29 kDa, and it exhibits a unique structure that has not been described previously for any known virus. The 5' end of this gene is derived from sequences encoding RaLV matrix followed by 20 bp derived from the U5 region of the RaLV LTR (RS-U5 element) which is joined at its 3' end to sequences derived from all six (coding and noncoding) exons of the c-ras proto-oncogene at the 3' end.

Several problems prevent the application of MuLV-based recombinant retroviruses to lung gene therapy: (i) the lack of cell proliferation in mature pulmonary epithelia, (ii) inefficient gene transfer with a vector applied to the apical surface, and (iii) low titers of many retroviral preparations. We found that keratinocyte growth factor (KGF) stimulated proliferation of differentiated human tracheal and bronchial epithelia. Approximately 50% of epithelia divided in response to KGF as assessed by bromodeoxyuridine histochemistry. In airway epithelia stimulated to divide with KGF, high-titer ampho- and xenotropic enveloped vectors preferentially infected cells from the basal side. However, treatment with hypotonic shock or EGTA transiently increased transepithelial permeability, enhancing gene transfer with the vector applied to the mucosal surfaces of KGF-stimulated epithelia. Up to 35% of cells expressed the transgene after gene transfer. By using this approach, cells throughout the epithelial sheet, including basal cells, were targeted. Moreover, the Cl- transport defect in differentiated CF airway epithelia was corrected.

This inhibition is very potent and displays a strong transdominant effect; infectivity is reduced more than 100-fold when wild-type and mutant molecular clones are cotransfected at a 1:1 ratio. This phenomenon is observed with both ecotropic and amphotropic MuLV Env. The MA mutations do not affect the incorporation of MuLV Env into virions. We demonstrate that in HIV-1 virions pseudotyped with MuLV Env, the HIV-1 protease (PR) efficiently catalyzes the cleavage of the p15(E) transmembrane (TM) protein to p12(E). Immunoprecipitation analysis of pseudotyped virions reveals that the mutant MA blocks this HIV-1 PR-mediated cleavage of MuLV TM. Furthermore, the transdominant inhibition exerted by the mutant MA on wild-type infectivity correlates with the relative level of p15(E) cleavage. Consistent with the hypothesis that abrogation of infectivity imposed by the mutant MA is due to inhibition of p15(E) cleavage, mutant virions are significantly more infectious when pseudotyped with a truncated p12(E) form of MuLV Env. These results indicate that HIV-1 Gag sequences can influence the viral PR-mediated processing of the MuLV TM Env protein p15(E). These findings have implications for the development of HIV-1-based retroviral vectors pseudotyped with MuLV Env, since p15(E) cleavage is essential for activating membrane fusion and virus infectivity.","['Kiernan, R E', 'Freed, E O']","['Kiernan RE', 'Freed EO']","['Laboratory of Molecular Microbiology, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland 20892-0460, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Gene Products, env)', '0 (Viral Matrix Proteins)', 'EC 3.4.23.- (HIV Protease)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Gene Products, env/*physiology', 'Genetic Vectors', 'HIV Protease/*genetics/*physiology', 'HIV-1/*enzymology/*genetics/growth & development', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/genetics/pathogenicity/*physiology', 'Membrane Fusion', 'Mice', '*Mutation', 'Viral Matrix Proteins/genetics/physiology', 'Virulence/genetics/physiology']",1998/11/13 00:00,1998/11/13 00:01,['1998/11/13 00:00'],"['1998/11/13 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/11/13 00:01 [medline]', '1998/11/13 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.72.12.9621-9627.1998 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 1998 Dec;72(12):9621-7. doi: 10.1128/JVI.72.12.9621-9627.1998.,,,PMC110471,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Immunoprecipitation studies and binding assays of transfected mouse cells showed that these MAbs recognize class II major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules. Previously produced anti-class II MHC antibodies also blocked HTLV-1-induced cell fusion. Coimmunoprecipitation and competitive MAb binding studies indicated that class II MHC molecules and HTLV-1 envelope glycoproteins are not associated in infected cells. Anti-MHC antibodies had no effect on human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) syncytium formation by cells coinfected with HIV-1 and HTLV-1, ruling out a generalized disruption of cell membrane function by the antibodies. High expression of MHC molecules suggested that steric effects of bound anti-MHC antibodies might explain their inhibition of HTLV-1 fusion. An anti-class I MHC antibody and a polyclonal antibody consisting of several nonblocking MAbs against other molecules bound to MT2 cells at levels similar to those of class II MHC antibodies, and they also blocked HTLV-1 syncytium formation. Dose-response experiments showed that inhibition of HTLV-1 syncytium formation correlated with levels of antibody bound to the surface of infected cells.

Four of the GALVs, including GALV strain SEATO (GALV-S), were originally isolated from gibbon apes, whereas the fifth member of this family, simian sarcoma-associated virus (SSAV), was isolated from a woolly monkey and shares 78% amino acid identity with GALV-S. To determine whether these viruses have identical host ranges, we evaluated the susceptibility of several cell lines to either GALV-S or SSAV infection. GALV-S and SSAV have the same host range with the exception of Chinese hamster lung E36 cells, which are susceptible to GALV-S but not SSAV. We used retroviral vectors that differ only in their envelope composition (e.g., they contain either SSAV or GALV-S envelope protein) to show that the envelope of SSAV restricts entry into E36 cells. Although unable to infect E36 cells, SSAV infects GALV-resistant murine cells expressing the E36-derived viral receptor, HaPit2. These results suggest that the receptors present on E36 cells function for SSAV. We have constructed several vectors containing GALV-S/SSAV chimeric envelope proteins to map the region of the SSAV envelope that blocks infection of E36 cells. Vectors bearing chimeric envelopes comprised of the N-terminal region of the GALV-S SU protein and the C-terminal region of SSAV infect E36 cells, whereas vectors containing the N-terminal portion of the SSAV SU protein and C-terminal portion of GALV-S fail to infect E36 cells. This finding indicates that the region of the SSAV envelope protein responsible for restricting SSAV infection of E36 cells lies within its amino-terminal region.","['Ting, Y T', 'Wilson, C A', 'Farrell, K B', 'Chaudry, G J', 'Eiden, M V']","['Ting YT', 'Wilson CA', 'Farrell KB', 'Chaudry GJ', 'Eiden MV']","['Laboratory of Cellular and Molecular Regulation, National Institute of Mental Health, Bethesda, Maryland 20892, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (Gene Products, env)', '0 (Receptors, Virus)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Cricetinae', 'Cricetulus', 'DNA, Viral/genetics/isolation & purification', 'Gene Products, env/chemistry/genetics/physiology', 'Genes, env', 'Genetic Vectors', 'Helper Viruses/pathogenicity', 'Leukemia Virus, Gibbon Ape/genetics/*pathogenicity', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Receptors, Virus/*physiology', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/chemistry/genetics', 'Sarcoma Virus, Woolly Monkey/genetics/*pathogenicity', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid', 'Virulence/genetics']",1998/11/13 00:00,1998/11/13 00:01,['1998/11/13 00:00'],"['1998/11/13 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/11/13 00:01 [medline]', '1998/11/13 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.72.12.9453-9458.1998 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 1998 Dec;72(12):9453-8. doi: 10.1128/JVI.72.12.9453-9458.1998.,,,PMC110436,,,,"['GENBANK/AF055060', 'GENBANK/AF055061', 'GENBANK/AF055062', 'GENBANK/AF055063', 'GENBANK/AF055064']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

In M1 myeloid leukemia cells, CIS3 was induced by neither interleukin 6 (IL6) nor interferon gamma (IFNgamma), while JAB was induced strongly by IFNgamma and slightly by IL6 and leukemia inhibitory factor (ILF). Forced expression of CIS3 and JAB in M1 cells prevented IL6- or LIF-induced growth arrest and differentiation, even when their expression levels were comparable to endogenous ones in several cell lines such as HEL, UT-7, IFNgamma-treated M1, and CTLL2 cells. Pretreatment of parental M1 cells with IFNgamma but not IFNbeta resulted in suppression of LIF-induced STAT3 activation and differentiation, further supporting that physiological level of JAB is sufficient to inhibit LIF-signaling. However, unlike JAB, CIS3 did not inhibit IFNgamma-induced growth arrest, suggesting a difference in cytokine specificity between CIS3 and JAB. CIS3 inhibited STAT3 activation with slower kinetics than JAB and allowed rapid c-fos induction and partial FcgammaRI expression in response to IL6. In 293 cells, CIS3 as well as JAB bound to JAK2 tyrosine kinase domain (JH1), and inhibited its kinase activity, however, the effect of CIS3 on tyrosine kinase activity was weaker than that of JAB, indicating that CIS3 possesses lower affinity to JAK kinases than JAB. These findings suggest that CIS3 is a weaker inhibitor than JAB against JAK signaling, and JAB and CIS3 possess different regulatory roles in cytokine signaling.","['Suzuki, R', 'Sakamoto, H', 'Yasukawa, H', 'Masuhara, M', 'Wakioka, T', 'Sasaki, A', 'Yuge, K', 'Komiya, S', 'Inoue, A', 'Yoshimura, A']","['Suzuki R', 'Sakamoto H', 'Yasukawa H', 'Masuhara M', 'Wakioka T', 'Sasaki A', 'Yuge K', 'Komiya S', 'Inoue A', 'Yoshimura A']","['Institute of Life Science, Kurume University, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (SOCS1 protein, human)', '0 (SOCS3 protein, human)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT3 protein, human)', '0 (Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling 1 Protein)', '0 (Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling 3 Protein)', '0 (Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling Proteins)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '77238-31-4 (Interferon-beta)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)']",IM,"['Carrier Proteins/genetics/*physiology', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*metabolism', 'Gene Expression/drug effects', 'Growth Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Interferon-beta/pharmacology', 'Interferon-gamma/*pharmacology', 'Interleukin-6/pharmacology/*physiology', '*Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute', 'Lymphokines/*pharmacology', 'Proteins/genetics/*physiology', '*Repressor Proteins', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor', 'Signal Transduction', 'Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling 1 Protein', 'Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling 3 Protein', 'Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling Proteins', 'Trans-Activators/*metabolism', '*Transcription Factors', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects']",1998/11/12 00:00,1998/11/12 00:01,['1998/11/12 00:00'],"['1998/11/12 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/11/12 00:01 [medline]', '1998/11/12 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.onc.1202143 [doi]'],ppublish,Oncogene. 1998 Oct 29;17(17):2271-8. doi: 10.1038/sj.onc.1202143.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recent studies have shown that inhibitors of histone deacetylases can relieve transcriptional repression caused by the products of certain oncogenes. We tested whether these findings could be applied clinically to a patient with highly resistant acute promyelocytic leukemia. METHODS: A patient who had experienced multiple relapses was treated with all-trans-retinoic acid alone and in combination with sodium phenylbutyrate, an inhibitor of histone deacetylases. Immunohistochemistry and western blot analysis were used to assay for histone hyperacetylation in mononuclear cells from the patient's blood and bone marrow. Marrow mononuclear cells and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis of messenger RNA encoded by the PML/RAR-alpha oncogene were used to assess minimal residual disease. RESULTS: The patient proved clinically resistant to treatment with all-trans-retinoic acid alone. However, 23 days after sodium phenylbutyrate was added to the treatment regimen, visible leukemic cells had been eliminated from her bone marrow, and she achieved a complete clinical and cytogenetic remission shortly thereafter. With a second treatment course, analysis for minimal residual disease by RT-PCR proved negative. Immunofluorescence and western blot analysis showed that phenylbutyrate caused a time-dependent increase in histone acetylation in blood and bone marrow mononuclear cells. CONCLUSIONS: Clinical treatment with an inhibitor of histone deacetylase induces histone hyperacetylation in target cells and may restore sensitivity to the anti-leukemic effects of all-trans-retinoic acid in acute promyelocytic leukemia. Similar therapy may prove useful in other neoplastic diseases that are associated with oncogenic repression of gene transcription due to recruitment of histone deacetylases.","['Warrell, R P Jr', 'He, L Z', 'Richon, V', 'Calleja, E', 'Pandolfi, P P']","['Warrell RP Jr', 'He LZ', 'Richon V', 'Calleja E', 'Pandolfi PP']","['Department of Medicine, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, and the Cornell University Medical College, New York, NY 10021, USA. rwarrell@mskcc.org']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Natl Cancer Inst,Journal of the National Cancer Institute,7503089,"['0 (Phenylbutyrates)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', '7WY7YBI87E (4-phenylbutyric acid)', 'EC 3.5.1.98 (Histone Deacetylases)']",IM,"['Acetylation/drug effects', 'Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Blotting, Western', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Female', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Histone Deacetylases/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*drug therapy/enzymology', 'Phenylbutyrates/administration & dosage', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Transcription, Genetic/*drug effects', 'Tretinoin/administration & dosage']",1998/11/12 03:03,2001/03/28 10:01,['1998/11/12 03:03'],"['1998/11/12 03:03 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1998/11/12 03:03 [entrez]']",['10.1093/jnci/90.21.1621 [doi]'],ppublish,J Natl Cancer Inst. 1998 Nov 4;90(21):1621-5. doi: 10.1093/jnci/90.21.1621.,"['CA09207/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA77136/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA87423/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",['J Natl Cancer Inst. 1999 Mar 3;91(5):475-6.

Here we suggest that JL1 antigen can be efficiently used for diagnosis and treatment. JL1 is a human thymocyte differentiation antigen strictly confined to a CD4+CD8+ double positive subpopulation of cortical thymocytes. Despite its restricted distribution in normal tissues and cells, the expression of JL1 is highly associated with hematopoietic malignancies, particularly various types of leukemia such as T-lineage acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL), non-T-ALL, and acute myelocytic leukemia (AML). The expression of JL1 antigen was observed in 75.6% of leukemic cases (117 out of 154 leukemic patients tested) with a high mean fluorescence intensity on flow cytometric analysis and confirmed by immunoblotting. Since JL1 antigen is selectively expressed on the surface of human leukemic cells, but not on mature human peripheral blood cells and normal bone marrow cells, anti-JL1 mAb can be used as a reagent of choice in the routine diagnosis of various types of leukemia, providing an excellent candidate for the treatment of these diseases.","['Kim, T J', 'Park, S H']","['Kim TJ', 'Park SH']","['Department of Pathology, Sungkyunkwan University College of Medicine, Suwon, Korea.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Korea (South),J Korean Med Sci,Journal of Korean medical science,8703518,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte)', '0 (Antigens, Surface)', '0 (JL1 antigen)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/therapeutic use', 'Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte/*immunology', 'Antigens, Surface/immunology', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy', 'Leukemia/diagnosis/*immunology/*therapy', 'Thymus Gland/*immunology']",1998/11/12 00:00,1998/11/12 00:01,['1998/11/12 00:00'],"['1998/11/12 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/11/12 00:01 [medline]', '1998/11/12 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.3346/jkms.1998.13.5.455 [doi]'],ppublish,J Korean Med Sci. 1998 Oct;13(5):455-8. doi: 10.3346/jkms.1998.13.5.455.,,,PMC3054527,14,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis was used to measure the changes in antigen expression (CD11b/c, CD16, CD64, CD14, CD68, and CD95) in response to MTX, 1,25-OH-cholecalciferol (1,25-OH-CCF), and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor in the human monoblastic leukemia cell line U937, bone marrow mononuclear cells (BMMC), and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). Release of interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta), IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra), tumor necrosis factor a, and soluble tumor necrosis factor receptors (sTNFR) p55 and p75 during the differentiation in vitro was assessed by immunoassay in the culture supernatants. RESULTS: MTX alone and in combination with 1,25-OH-CCF markedly stimulated the differentiation of the monocytic U937 cells and simultaneously increased Fas-antigen expression. Differentiation was associated with enhanced IL-1Ra and sTNFR p75 release from U937 cells. MTX had fewer effects on phenotypic differentiation of human BMMC and PBMC, but did stimulate IL-1Ra release and inhibit IL-1beta synthesis in BMMC. CONCLUSION: MTX acts as a strong differentiation factor for immature and undifferentiated monocytic cells. Differentiation in vitro is associated with an increase in natural cytokine inhibitor release and a simultaneous down-regulation of IL-1beta.

METHODS: The effect of Tax protein on the proliferation of synovial cells was evaluated using a 3H-thymidine incorporation assay. Production of cytokines was determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB) DNA binding activity and the transcription of several NF-kappaB-mediated genes was detected by electrophoretic mobility shift assay and reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: The proliferation of synovial cells, as well as their expression of tumor necrosis factor alpha, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, and interleukin-6, was significantly enhanced by extracellular Tax at concentrations of 2.5 pM to 25 nM. In contrast, extracellular bacterial extract did not change the cytokine expression or the proliferation of these cells. Proliferation of synovial cells induced by Tax protein may be due to activated expression of several cytokines and protooncogenes that contain NF-kappaB regulatory sequences. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that extracellular Tax can regulate the expression of endogenous cellular genes in synovial cells and may contribute to the NF-kappaB-mediated synovial hyperplasia.","['Aono, H', 'Fujisawa, K', 'Hasunuma, T', 'Marriott, S J', 'Nishioka, K']","['Aono H', 'Fujisawa K', 'Hasunuma T', 'Marriott SJ', 'Nishioka K']","['St. Marianna University School of Medicine, Kawasaki, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Arthritis Rheum,Arthritis and rheumatism,0370605,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (Interleukin-1)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Oligonucleotide Probes)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '126547-89-5 (Intercellular Adhesion Molecule-1)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",IM,"['Cell Division/physiology', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/metabolism', 'Extracellular Space/immunology/virology', 'Gene Expression/immunology', 'Gene Products, tax/genetics/*immunology', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/genetics', 'HTLV-I Infections/immunology/*pathology', '*Human T-lymphotropic virus 1', 'Humans', 'Hyperplasia', 'Intercellular Adhesion Molecule-1/genetics', 'Interleukin-1/genetics', 'Interleukin-6/genetics', 'NF-kappa B/immunology/metabolism', 'Oligonucleotide Probes', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc/genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'Synovial Membrane/immunology/*pathology/*virology', 'Transcriptional Activation/immunology', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/genetics']",1998/11/12 00:00,1998/11/12 00:01,['1998/11/12 00:00'],"['1998/11/12 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/11/12 00:01 [medline]', '1998/11/12 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/1529-0131(199811)41:11<1995::AID-ART15>3.0.CO;2-4 [doi]'],ppublish,Arthritis Rheum. 1998 Nov;41(11):1995-2003. doi: 10.1002/1529-0131(199811)41:11<1995::AID-ART15>3.0.CO;2-4.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The benign tumors, consisting of mature lamellar bone and surrounded by a thin periosteum, were cultured on sponges of denatured collagen type I fibres for up to 4 weeks. At this time osteoma cells had grown into the collagenous matrix. After release and further cultivation in monolayers, the cell lines established from these cultures varied in morphology; they expressed T1, collagen type I and type III, alkaline phosphatase, osteonectin and osteopontin mRNAs at variable levels, but not osteocalcin/BGP. They also showed alkaline phosphatase activity, but lacked responsiveness to parathyroid hormone. All cell lines established from infected mice expressed retroviral and c-myc mRNA and viral protein. In contrast to cells from control mice they showed an extended life span in culture. After growth in a three-dimensional (3-D) collagen sponge culture the cells formed an extracellular matrix containing collagen type I, alkaline phosphatase and osteocalcin/BGP. These data indicate that the two-step method facilitates the establishment of osteoblast-like cell lines from osteomas and calvaria of old mice, and provides means for further analyses of retrovirus-induced skeletal pathogenesis and bone induction.","['Goralczyk, R', 'Appold, A', 'Luz, A', 'Riemann, S', 'Strauss, P G', 'Erfle, V', 'Schmidt, J']","['Goralczyk R', 'Appold A', 'Luz A', 'Riemann S', 'Strauss PG', 'Erfle V', 'Schmidt J']","['Institute of Molecular Virology, GSF-National Research Center for Environment and Health, Neuherberg, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Differentiation,Differentiation; research in biological diversity,0401650,"['0 (Parathyroid Hormone)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc)', 'EC 3.1.3.1 (Alkaline Phosphatase)']",IM,"['Alkaline Phosphatase/metabolism', 'Animals', 'Bone Neoplasms/pathology/*virology', 'Cell Differentiation/physiology', 'Cell Division/physiology', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*physiology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred CBA', 'Mice, Inbred Strains', 'Osteoblasts/*cytology', 'Osteoma/pathology/*virology', 'Parathyroid Hormone/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc/biosynthesis', 'Retroviridae Infections/*virology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Virus Replication']",1998/11/12 00:00,1998/11/12 00:01,['1998/11/12 00:00'],"['1998/11/12 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/11/12 00:01 [medline]', '1998/11/12 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0301-4681(09)60654-X [pii]', '10.1046/j.1432-0436.1998.6350253.x [doi]']",ppublish,Differentiation. 1998 Sep;63(5):253-62. doi: 10.1046/j.1432-0436.1998.6350253.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the course of the conventional double labeling the light scatter based gating is the method of choice, which allows the immunophenotypic characterization of the subpopulations of interest. Using this gating strategy one can separate the lymphocytes, monocytes, neutrophil granulocytes, eosinophils and platelets as distinct cell populations in normal blood samples. The blastic cells present in different malignant hematological disorders might, however, represent an overlapping population with the lymphocytes, NK-cells, monocytes, and nucleated erytroid elements on the FSC vs. SSC histogram, making it difficult or impossible to separate them from the residual reactive cells. This will impart false mixed immunophenotypic property to the blastic cells. The authors found definitive advantages of CD45 vs. SSC gating in contrast to the FSC vs. SSC analysis due to the reliable separation of lymphoblasts, myeloblasts, nucleated erytroblasts as well as the debris from the reactive cell populations. The most plausible application of this method is shown in the course of three-color labeling, applying CD45 as a constant marker. Furthermore, the authors demonstrated that the CD45 vs. SSC gating strategy will result in considerable increase in resolution of blastic population also in the course of the most conventional dual-color labeling method.","['Jakso, P', 'Pajor, L']","['Jakso P', 'Pajor L']","['Pecsi Orvostudomanyi Egyetem, Patologiai Intezet.']",['hun'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Hungary,Orv Hetil,Orvosi hetilap,0376412,,IM,"['Flow Cytometry', 'Gated Blood-Pool Imaging', 'Humans', '*Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*immunology/pathology', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*immunology/pathology', 'Lymphoma/*immunology/pathology']",1998/11/12 00:00,1998/11/12 00:01,['1998/11/12 00:00'],"['1998/11/12 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/11/12 00:01 [medline]', '1998/11/12 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Orv Hetil. 1998 Oct 18;139(42):2509-13.,,,,,A CD45 kapuzas elonye malignus haematologiai betegsegek immunfenotipizalasa soran.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The use of telomere length and telomerase expression as new biological markers in cancer patients requires their correlation with disease prognosis. We, therefore, correlated the mean telomere length based on a telomere restriction fragment assay and the activity of telomerase measured with a telomeric repeat amplification protocol with clinical data and overall survival in 58 patients with B cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL). Telomere length showed a highly inverse correlation to telomerase activity. Patients with telomeres below 6.0 kb were associated with high telomerase activity, whereas patients with a telomere length >6.0 kb generally showed low enzyme activity (P <0.001). Patients in Binet A exhibited significantly longer telomeres and had less telomerase activity than did patients in Binet B or Binet C, where significantly shorter telomeres and higher telomerase activity were observed (P=0.031). Short telomere length and high telomerase activity were significantly associated with a shorter median survival (P=0.02 and P <0.001), and telomerase activity was the most significant prognostic factor for overall survival in B-CLL (P <0.001).

Importantly, the p36 MBP kinase was immunologically different from MAPK superfamily molecules such as ERK1, JNK isoforms, and p38 MAPK. In addition, the p36 MBP kinase activation and apoptotic DNA fragmentation were inhibited by antioxidants such as N-acetylcysteine and reduced-form glutathione. The p36 MBP kinase activation was also observed during hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and okadaic acid-induced apoptosis. Although a specific inhibitor of caspase-3-like proteases (Ac-DEVD-CHO) or a specific inhibitor of caspase-1-like proteases (Ac-YVAD-CHO) did not block the cytotrienin A-, H2O2-, or okadaic acid-induced apoptosis, a broad specificity inhibitor of caspases (Z-Asp-CH2-DCB) strongly inhibited the apoptosis of HL-60 cells. Surprisingly, Z-Asp-CH2-DCB inhibited the activation of p36 MBP kinase induced by cytotrienin A or H2O2, but did not inhibit the activation of JNK/stress-activated protein kinase and p38 MAPK. Taken together, these results indicate that p36 MBP kinase activation is downstream of the activation of Z-Asp-CH2-DCB-sensitive caspases, and reactive oxygen species could be included in the apoptotic events. Moreover, according to the Western blotting using the antibodies against MST1/Krs2 or MST2/Krs1, it is suggested that the p36 MBP kinase is an active proteolytic product of MST1/Krs2 and MST2/Krs1, which are originally cloned by virtue of its homology to the budding yeast Ste20 kinase. Thus, the p36 MBP kinase might be a common component of the diverse signaling pathways leading to apoptosis, and controlling this p36 MBP kinase pathway might be a novel strategy for cancer chemotherapy.","['Kakeya, H', 'Onose, R', 'Osada, H']","['Kakeya H', 'Onose R', 'Osada H']","['Antibiotics Laboratory, The Institute of Physical and Chemical Research (RIKEN), Saitama, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Antioxidants)', '0 (Rifamycins)', '0 (cytotrienin A)', '1W21G5Q4N2 (Okadaic Acid)', 'BBX060AN9V (Hydrogen Peroxide)', 'EC 2.7.- (Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (STK3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Serine-Threonine Kinase 3)', 'EC 2.7.11.17 (Calcium-Calmodulin-Dependent Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.26 (Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3)', 'EC 2.7.12.2 (MAP Kinase Kinase 4)', 'EC 2.7.12.2 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",IM,"['Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/*pharmacology', 'Antioxidants/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Calcium-Calmodulin-Dependent Protein Kinases/*metabolism', 'Caspases/*physiology', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Hydrogen Peroxide/pharmacology', '*JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases', 'MAP Kinase Kinase 4', '*Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinases', 'Molecular Weight', 'Okadaic Acid/pharmacology', 'Protein Kinases/metabolism', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/metabolism', 'Rifamycins/*pharmacology', 'Serine-Threonine Kinase 3']",1998/11/11 00:00,1998/11/11 00:01,['1998/11/11 00:00'],"['1998/11/11 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/11/11 00:01 [medline]', '1998/11/11 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1998 Nov 1;58(21):4888-94.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Shedding of gangliosides by tumor cells may contribute to this tumor-induced bone marrow suppression. We studied in vitro the inhibitory effects of murine neuroblastoma cells (Neuro-2a and C1300) and their gangliosides on hemopoiesis using normal murine hemopoietic progenitor colony-forming assays. Transwell cultured neuroblastoma cells showed a dose-dependent inhibition on hemopoiesis, indicating that a soluble factor was responsible for this effect. Furthermore, the supernatant of Neuro-2a cultured cells inhibited hemopoietic proliferation and differentiation. To determine whether the inhibitory effect was indeed due to shed gangliosides and not, for instance, caused by cytokines, the effect of DL-threo-1 -phenyl-2-decanoylamino-3-morpholino-1-propanol (DL-PDMP) on Neuro-2a cells was studied. DL-PDMP is a potent inhibitor of glucosylceramide synthase, resulting in inhibition of the synthesis and shedding of gangliosides. The initially observed inhibitory effect of supernatant of Neuro-2a cells was abrogated by culturing these cells for 3 days in the presence of 10 microM DL-PDMP. Moreover, gangliosides isolated from Neuro-2a cell membranes inhibited hemopoietic growth. To determine whether the described phenomena in vitro are a reflection of bone marrow suppression occurring in vivo, gangliosides isolated from plasma of neuroblastoma patients were tested for their effects on human hemopoietic progenitor colony-forming assays. These human neuroblastoma-derived gangliosides inhibited normal erythropoiesis (colony-forming unit-erythroid/burst-forming unit-erythroid) and myelopoiesis (colony-forming unit-granulocyte/macrophage) to a higher extent compared with gangliosides isolated from control plasma. Altogether these results suggest that gangliosides shed by neuroblastoma cells inhibit hemopoiesis and may contribute to the observed bone marrow depression in neuroblastoma patients.","['Sietsma, H', 'Nijhof, W', 'Dontje, B', 'Vellenga, E', 'Kamps, W A', 'Kok, J W']","['Sietsma H', 'Nijhof W', 'Dontje B', 'Vellenga E', 'Kamps WA', 'Kok JW']","[""Department of Pediatric Oncology, Beatrix Children's Hospital, University Hospital, Groningen, The Netherlands.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (G(M3) Ganglioside)', '0 (Gangliosides)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Female', 'G(M3) Ganglioside/pharmacology', 'Gangliosides/*pharmacology', 'Hematopoiesis/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Neuroblastoma/*physiopathology']",1998/11/11 00:00,1998/11/11 00:01,['1998/11/11 00:00'],"['1998/11/11 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/11/11 00:01 [medline]', '1998/11/11 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1998 Nov 1;58(21):4840-4.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study investigated the mRNA expression of bovine LIF (bLIF), gp130 and LR-beta in pooled or individual bovine oocytes and embryos generated in vitro or in vivo after superovulation. Transcripts of gp130 and LR-beta were detectable in as little material as 1/3 oocyte equivalent and bLIF transcripts in two embryo equivalents employing a simple, rapid and robust one-step reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) protocol using random hexamer priming during reverse transcription and 60 amplification cycles in the PCR. All mRNA fragments were also found in cumulus cells and various bovine tissues. While gp130 and LR-beta mRNA were present in pooled material throughout embryo development in vitro from the immature oocyte to the hatched blastocyst, bLIF-transcripts were absent in immature oocytes, inconsistently expressed from the matured oocyte up to the 16-cell stage as well as in blastocysts dependent on embryo batch. It was not found in morulae, but again present in hatched blastocysts. In contrast, in in-vivo derived embryos no bLIF was found, LR-beta was not detected at the morula to blastocyst transition while gp130 transcripts were observed from the morula to the hatched blastocyst. In individual embryos the mRNA expression pattern was similar for both in-vitro and in-vivo derived embryos as found in pooled material. These results indicate perturbation of the mRNA expression pattern of the specific LIF-LIF-receptor system in embryos generated in vitro that could lead to abnormal differentiation of the cell compartments forming the blastocyst. Cumulus cells, frequently used as supportive factor in co-culture in bovine in-vitro embryo production, are a rich source of the LIF-LIF-receptor system acting in a paracrine and/or autocrine manner. The biological function of the LIF-LIF-receptor system during bovine preimplantation development warrants further investigation.","['Eckert, J', 'Niemann, H']","['Eckert J', 'Niemann H']","['Department of Biotechnology, Institut fur Tierzucht und Tierverhalten (FAL) Mariensee, Neustadt, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Mol Hum Reprod,Molecular human reproduction,9513710,"['0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor Receptor alpha Subunit)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', '0 (Lifr protein, mouse)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Receptors, Cytokine)', '0 (Receptors, OSM-LIF)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Blastocyst', 'Cattle', 'Embryo, Mammalian/*physiology', 'Embryonic Development', 'Female', 'Fertilization in Vitro', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental', 'Growth Inhibitors/*genetics/metabolism', '*Interleukin-6', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor Receptor alpha Subunit', 'Lymphokines/*genetics/metabolism', 'Oocytes/physiology', 'Pregnancy', 'Receptors, Cytokine/*genetics/metabolism', 'Receptors, OSM-LIF', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Tissue Distribution']",1998/11/11 00:00,1998/11/11 00:01,['1998/11/11 00:00'],"['1998/11/11 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/11/11 00:01 [medline]', '1998/11/11 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/molehr/4.10.957 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Hum Reprod. 1998 Oct;4(10):957-65. doi: 10.1093/molehr/4.10.957.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The purpose of this study was to describe the cutaneous lesions and the course of illness in 7 well-documented patients with Philadelphia chromosome-positive (Ph+) CML treated with IFN. We reviewed 7 patients diagnosed with Ph+ CML at M.D. Anderson Cancer Center between 1983 and 1994 who experienced cutaneous lesions at the injection site after treatment with i.m. or s.c. IFN (3 patients treated with IFN-alpha, 3 with combined IFN-alpha and IFN-gamma, and 1 with IFN-beta). According to pathology reports available for 3 patients, the cutaneous lesions seem to be consistent with necrotizing vasculitis. The skin reactions occurred independent of the IFN type, administration modality (i.m. or s.c.), duration of previously received IFN therapy (3-108 months), stage of disease, and cytogenetic response to IFN treatment. Of 7 patients, 4 developed low-grade fever during the occurrence of skin reactions, but all cultures taken from the abscesslike lesions were negative for bacterial or fungal infection. These lesions either did not resolve and required surgical debridement (5 patients) or resolved slowly with conservative management that included discontinuation of IFN at the specific, involved site. Independent of the IFN type or i.m. or s.c. injections, IFN can cause painful and long-lasting cutaneous lesions that frequently require surgical intervention. Whether this is a result of the high concentration of IFN at the injection site, the diluent, or an immunologic reaction remains unclear.","['Krainick, U', 'Kantarjian, H', 'Broussard, S', 'Talpaz, M']","['Krainick U', 'Kantarjian H', 'Broussard S', 'Talpaz M']","['Heidelberg University Medical School, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",United States,J Interferon Cytokine Res,Journal of interferon & cytokine research : the official journal of the International Society for Interferon and Cytokine Research,9507088,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '9008-11-1 (Interferons)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*adverse effects', 'Chronic Disease', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Injections, Intramuscular/adverse effects', 'Injections, Subcutaneous/adverse effects', 'Interferons/*adverse effects', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Necrosis', 'Vasculitis, Leukocytoclastic, Cutaneous/*chemically induced/pathology']",1998/11/11 00:00,1998/11/11 00:01,['1998/11/11 00:00'],"['1998/11/11 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/11/11 00:01 [medline]', '1998/11/11 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1089/jir.1998.18.823 [doi]'],ppublish,J Interferon Cytokine Res. 1998 Oct;18(10):823-7. doi: 10.1089/jir.1998.18.823.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The BCR/ABL1-D probe, formatted to display a fluorescent signal for both the reciprocal products of a 9/22 rearrangement, gave a positive fusion signal on the derivatives 9 and 22. These findings favor either a cryptic reciprocal exchange between BCR and ABL loci or the reversal of a Philadelphia translocation. An insertion of BCR next to ABL is ruled out.

This cell is believed to recruit neighbours to form a cluster of cells which then divides to form a mature sense organ. In most systems so far studied, sense organ type appears to be specified by the identity of proneural genes involved in the selection of precursors. The regulation of proneural gene expression is, in turn, controlled by the prepatterning genes. In the antenna, the only known proneural function is that of atonal, a gene that is involved in founder cell choice in the sensilla coeloconica, and no prepatterning gene function has yet been demonstrated. In this study, we show that Lozenge, a protein which possesses a DNA binding domain similar to that of the Acute myeloid leukemia-1/Runt transcription factors, functions in a dose-dependent manner to specify the fate of the other two types of sense organs in the antenna: the sensilla trichoidea and the sensilla basiconica. Our results suggest that Lozenge may act on the epidermal field, resulting in founder cells acquiring specific cell fates that lead to the development of an appropriate type of sense organ.","['Gupta, B P', 'Flores, G V', 'Banerjee, U', 'Rodrigues, V']","['Gupta BP', 'Flores GV', 'Banerjee U', 'Rodrigues V']","['Department of Biological Sciences, Tata Institute of Fundamental Research, Homi Bhabha Road, Mumbai, India.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Dev Biol,Developmental biology,0372762,"['0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Drosophila Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (lz protein, Drosophila)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Body Patterning/*genetics', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit', '*DNA-Binding Proteins', 'Drosophila/*embryology', '*Drosophila Proteins', 'Gene Dosage', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental/genetics', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Mutation/genetics', 'Phenotype', '*Proto-Oncogene Proteins', 'Sense Organs/*growth & development', 'Smell/*genetics', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics']",1998/11/11 00:00,1998/11/11 00:01,['1998/11/11 00:00'],"['1998/11/11 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/11/11 00:01 [medline]', '1998/11/11 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0012-1606(98)99064-9 [pii]', '10.1006/dbio.1998.9064 [doi]']",ppublish,Dev Biol. 1998 Nov 15;203(2):400-11. doi: 10.1006/dbio.1998.9064.,"['GM07185/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01EY08152/EY/NEI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,['Copyright 1998 Academic Press.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To elucidate the role of these new compounds in vivo, it is essential to establish quick and sensitive detection methods. To this end, we prepared an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay specific for 15-epi-LXA4 that proved to be highly sensitive (IC50 approximately 50 pg, minimum detection approximately 3.5 pg) and stereoselective. The amounts of 15-epi-LXA4 generated by human neutrophils from peripheral blood of healthy volunteers using this enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay were in agreement with those values obtained by liquid chromatography. Formation of 15-epi-LXA4 was cell ratio-dependent during THP-1 (a monocytic leukemia cell line)-neutrophil interactions with ASA-treated cells, and 15-epi-LXA4 was not detected with either cell type alone. Generation of 15-epi-LXA4 was also examined in murine peritonitis with ASA administration. Exudates from ASA-treated mice showed increased production of 15-epi-LXA4 that was diminished by indomethacin, a blocker of ASA-dependent acetylation of prostaglandin G/H synthase. A cytochrome P450 inhibitor administered in the presence of ASA did not prevent 15-epi-LXA4 formation, which suggests that P450 does not significantly contribute to formation of 15-epi-LXA4 in this murine model. These results indicate that the new enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay is both sensitive and selective for 15-epi-LXA4 and that 15-epi-LXA4 is produced by human leukocyte-leukocyte interactions. In addition, 15-epi-LXA4 is generated by inflammatory exudates when ASA is administered during murine peritonitis and when prostaglandin G/H synthase is upregulated and acetylated. This assay should provide rapid means to investigate 15-epi-LXA4 generation in both cellular and animal models.","['Chiang, N', 'Takano, T', 'Clish, C B', 'Petasis, N A', 'Tai, H H', 'Serhan, C N']","['Chiang N', 'Takano T', 'Clish CB', 'Petasis NA', 'Tai HH', 'Serhan CN']","[""Center for Experimental Therapeutics and Reperfusion Injury, Department of Anesthesia, Brigham and Women's Hospital and Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Pharmacol Exp Ther,The Journal of pharmacology and experimental therapeutics,0376362,"['0 (Hydroxyeicosatetraenoic Acids)', '0 (Lipoxins)', '0 (lipoxin A4)', 'R16CO5Y76E (Aspirin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Aspirin/*pharmacology', 'Cell Line', 'Chromatography, Liquid', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Exudates and Transudates/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Hydroxyeicosatetraenoic Acids/*biosynthesis', '*Lipoxins', 'Mass Spectrometry', 'Mice', 'Neutrophil Activation', 'Neutrophils/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Peritonitis/*metabolism', 'Sensitivity and Specificity']",1998/11/10 00:00,1998/11/10 00:01,['1998/11/10 00:00'],"['1998/11/10 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/11/10 00:01 [medline]', '1998/11/10 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Pharmacol Exp Ther. 1998 Nov;287(2):779-90.,"['DK50305/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'GM38765/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here we investigated the influence of T-cell maturation occurring in NBB cells during the early postbirth period on the degree of engraftment, the incidence of GVHD, and the graft-versus-leukemia (GVL) potential. These parameters were compared in recipients grafted with bone marrow (BM) cells. We observed an increased percentage of CD4(+) mature T cells accompanied by the acquisition of proliferative responses to phytohemagglutinin (PHA) and to allogeneic cells of day-5 NBB cells. The capacity of day-2 NBB to engraft was moderately reduced and recipients developing GVHD were occasionally observed after the graft of day-5 NBB cells. No GVL effect was evidenced regardless of the time of postbirth blood collection. However, the GVL effect can be obtained by the delayed infusion of donor mature T cells to recipients grafted with day-0 NBB, without causing GVHD. In contrast, the same protocol applied to mice grafted with BM cells induced GVHD mortality of all recipients. Interleukin (IL)-10 but not IL-2 messenger RNA was expressed in NBB cells as opposed to BM cells. These findings suggest that, in terms of GVHD incidence, delayed infusion of mature T cells as post-transplant tumor immunotherapy would be more effective when applied after CB than after BM transplantation.","['de La Selle, V', 'Gluckman, E', 'Bruley-Rosset, M']","['de La Selle V', 'Gluckman E', 'Bruley-Rosset M']","['INSERM Unite 267, Immunogenetique des Allogreffes, Villejuif, France.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '11028-71-0 (Concanavalin A)', '130068-27-8 (Interleukin-10)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Animals, Newborn/*blood', 'Bone Marrow Cells/metabolism', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/adverse effects', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/cytology/immunology', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Concanavalin A/pharmacology', 'Fetal Blood/cytology', 'Graft Survival', 'Graft vs Host Disease/*prevention & control', '*Graft vs Tumor Effect', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/adverse effects/*methods', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-10/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Interleukin-2/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred DBA', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis', 'Radiation Chimera', 'Spleen/cytology', 'T-Lymphocytes/*cytology/immunology/transplantation']",1998/11/10 00:00,1998/11/10 00:01,['1998/11/10 00:00'],"['1998/11/10 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/11/10 00:01 [medline]', '1998/11/10 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)57842-7 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1998 Nov 15;92(10):3968-75.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
