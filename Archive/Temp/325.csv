Local bone-resorbing factors such as IL-1, TNF alpha, and LPS strongly induced expression of LIF/D-factor mRNA in both clonal MC3T3-E1 cells and primary osteoblast-like cells. Neither parathyroid hormone nor 1 alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 stimulated expression of LIF/D-factor mRNA. LIF/D-factor per se did not stimulate expression of its own mRNA. Appreciable amounts of LIF/D-factor were detected in synovial fluids from rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients but not in those with osteoarthritis (OA). Simultaneous treatment with LIF/D-factor, IL-1, and IL-6 at the concentrations found in synovial fluids from RA patients greatly enhanced bone resorption, though these cytokines did not stimulate bone resorption when separately applied. This suggests that LIF/D-factor produced by osteoblasts is in concert with other bone-resorbing cytokines such as IL-1 and IL-6 involved in the bone resorption seen in the joints of RA patients. LIF/D-factor specifically bound to MC3T3-E1 cells with an apparent dissociation constant of 161 pM and 1,100 binding sites/cell. LIF/D-factor dose-dependently suppressed incorporation of [3H]thymidine into MC3T3-E1 cells. In addition, it potentiated the alkaline phosphatase activity induced by retinoic acid, though LIF/D-factor alone had no effect on enzyme activity. These results suggest that LIF/D-factor is involved in not only osteoclastic bone resorption but also osteoblast differentiation in conjugation with other osteotropic factors.","['Department of Biochemistry, School of Dentistry, Showa University, Tokyo, Japan.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Eligible patients had completely resected tumors of the oral cavity, oropharynx, hypopharynx, or larynx. They were then randomized to receive either three cycles of cis-platinum and 5-FU chemotherapy followed by postoperative radiotherapy (CT/RT) or postoperative radiotherapy alone (RT). Patients were categorized as having either ""low-risk"" or ""high-risk"" treatment volumes depending on whether the surgical margin was greater than or equal to 5 mm, there was extracapsular nodal extension, and/or there was carcinoma-in-situ at the surgical margins. Radiation doses of 50-54 Gy were given to ""low-risk"" volumes and 60 Gy were given to ""high-risk"" volumes. A total of 442 analyzable patients were entered into this study with the mean-time-at-risk being 45.7 months at the time of the present analysis. The 4-year actuarial survival rate was 44% on the RT arm and 48% on the CT/RT arm (p = n.s.). Disease-free survival at 4 years was 38% on the RT arm compared to 46% on the CT/RT arm (p = n.s.). At 4 years the local/regional failure rate was 29% vs. 26% for the RT and CT/RT arms, respectively (p = n.s.). The incidence of first failure in the neck nodes was 10% on the RT arm compared to 5% on the CT/RT arm (p = 0.03 without adjusting for multiple testing) and the overall incidence of distant metastases was 23% on the RT arm compared to 15% on the CT/RT arm (p = 0.03).

We provide a basis for the overlapping actions of these three factors by demonstrating that the shared CNTF and LIF signaling pathways involve the IL-6 signal transducing receptor component gp130. Thus, the receptor system for CNTF is surprisingly unlike those used by the nerve growth factor family of neurotrophic factors, but is instead related to those used by a subclass of hematopoietic cytokines.","['Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Tarrytown, New York 10591.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Addition of an inhibitor (sphinganine, SP) of protein kinase C (PKC) enhanced 2-4-fold the ADM or DM-induced differentiation. This phenomenon was accompanied by a slightly augmented antiproliferative effect. The enhancement of differentiation induction in these treatments seemed to be absolute, since the combination treatment (ADM-SP or DM-SP) showed about 2.5-3.6 times as many differentiated cells as the treatment with the anticancer drugs ADM or DM alone. Further characterization of the interaction of ADM and DM with SP on differentiation of HL-60 cells was carried out. Whereas the addition of SP in the fresh medium after the removal of ADM or DM (0.5 h treatment) enhanced the induction of differentiation, a pretreatment (24 h) of the cells with SP followed by continuous exposure to ADM or DM did not show such enhancement effect. The addition of SP at as late as 48 h after the administration of ADM or DM potentiated the induction of differentiation to the same extent as in the simultaneous combination of ADM-SP or DM-SP. Similar results were obtained in the experiments with another PKC inhibitor, staurosporine. These results indicated that inhibition of PKC activities may play an important role in the later events during the induction of differentiation elicited by ADM or DM. The use of the antileukemia drugs ADM and DM in combination with an inhibition of PKC activity results in enhancement of induction of differentiation and suggests a new strategy and a promising approach to the treatment of leukemia.","['Department of Pharmacology, Chang Gung Medical College, Tao-Yuan, Taiwan, Republic of China.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Brequinar sodium inhibits the activity of this enzyme isolated from mammalian sources only but not those forms isolated from yeast or bacteria, which also use ubiquinone as the cofactor. Brequinar sodium also does not inhibit the activity of a soluble Zymobacterium oroticum dihydroorotate dehydrogenase which uses NAD+ as a cofactor. Brequinar sodium inhibits L1210 dihydroorotate dehydrogenase with mixed inhibition kinetics with respect to either the substrate (dihydroorotate) or the cofactor (ubiquinone Q6) with Ki' values in the 5-8 nM range. Our results suggest that brequinar sodium inhibits dihydroorotate dehydrogenase by binding to the enzyme at a unique site that is distinct from the dihydroorotate or the ubiquinone-binding site. This binding site appears to be unique to the mammalian enzyme, because brequinar sodium does not inhibit the yeast, Escherichia coli, or Z. oroticum forms of the enzyme.","['Du Pont Merck Pharmaceutical Company, Glenolden Laboratory, Pennsylvania 19036.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: The authors reviewed their records to study the macroscopic and microscopic features of the spleen in 53 patients; the authors also studied these features in 135 patients reported in the literature. Thus, a total of 188 patients with GM were studied. RESULTS: Splenomegaly was noted in 72% of the patients, including 71% of the patients from the authors' files and 73% of the patients reported in the literature. The spleen weight, recorded in 39 of the patients, ranged from 160 g to 2300 g; in 29 (80%) patients the spleen weighed more than 500 g and in 4 (10%) patients, more than 2000 g. However, mast cell (MC) infiltration of the spleen was recorded in only 65 (34%) patients (patients from authors' records, 39%; patients reported in literature, 32%). The following combinations were extremely rare: splenomegaly without evidence of MC infiltration (n = 1); and histologic evidence of MC infiltration in the absence of splenomegaly (n = 2). The histologic findings of the spleen could be assessed in nine of the patients from the authors' files, eight of whom had MC infiltration. In four patients, infiltration was diffuse and confined mainly to the red pulp; in the other four patients, it was more focal and involved mainly the white pulp. Spleen plasmacytosis was found in eight patients, eosinophilia in five, hemosiderosis in seven, and fibrosis in six. Concurrent acute nonlymphoblastic leukemia was diagnosed in four patients, none of whom had the skin lesions of urticaria pigmentosa. CONCLUSIONS: The authors' findings show that (1) splenomegaly is a common finding in GM and often is pronounced; (2) MC infiltration probably is the most important factor in the pathogenesis of splenomegaly in this disease; and (3) two different patterns of MC infiltration (diffuse and focal) can be identified in GM.","['Department of Special Histopathology and Cytopathology, Eberhard-Karls University, Tubingen, Germany.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Monocytes were isolated from peripheral blood by Percoll separation of E-rosette-negative cells, and cultured with cytokines under non-adherent, endotoxin-free conditions. TNF-alpha transcripts were undetectable in freshly isolated monocytes from normal donors. Only the combination of IFN-gamma/GM-CSF was consistently capable of inducing substantial TNF-alpha mRNA transcript levels and protein secretion. Levels of TNF-alpha transcripts induced by IFN-gamma/GM-CSF were maintained for at least 36 h, in contrast to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulation which caused TNF-alpha mRNA levels to peak after 2 h and decline rapidly thereafter. IFN-gamma/GM-CSF was also capable of inducing a prolonged (at least 48 h) secretion of TNF-alpha bioactivity. In contrast, greater than 80% of the total TNF-alpha bioactivity secreted by LPS-stimulated monocytes was secreted in the first 8 h. When monocytes were incubated with IFN-gamma alone ('priming'), washed and then exposed to GM-CSF, both TNF-alpha mRNA expression and TNF-alpha protein production occurred.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","['Leukemia/Bone Marrow Transplantation Program of British Columbia, Vancouver, Canada.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In model experiments employing MOLT4 cells it was found that with 50-fold excess of immunobeads relative to antigen-positive cells, the use of each antibody alone resulted in a 3.3-3.6 log tumor cell depletion, as assessed in a sensitive and reproducible clonogenic soft agar assay. When all three antibodies were used in a mixture, a purging efficacy of 5 logs was achieved. Two treatment cycles improved these figures to about 4 logs and more than 5 logs. When MOLT4 cells were mixed 1:10 with fresh bone marrow cells the antibody mixture yielded 3.1 and more than 5 log tumor cell depletion with one and two treatment cycles, respectively. This procedure resulted in only an insignificant reduction of the number of CFU-GM and CFU-GEMM progenitor cells. In two patients autotransplanted with purged marrow, the loss of CFU-GM was 37% and 48%, and no tumor cells could be detected by immunocytochemistry after purging.

Interaction with the leukaemia is both by direct cell-contact cytotoxicity, and indirectly via cytokines and growth factors. T4 and T8 lymphocytes recognize a spectrum of minor histocompatibility antigens on the leukaemia cell which may be non-specific, leading to graft-versus-leukaemia and graft-versus-host reactions, or present only on myeloid cells leading to a tissue restricted response. The possibility that the P210 protein derived from the BCR/ABL fusion gene on chromosome 22 leads to the presentation via MHC molecules of leukaemia-specific peptide antigens is currently under investigation.

We have developed a photochemical decontamination system (PCD) for platelet concentrates (PC) utilizing treatment with long wavelength ultraviolet radiation (UVA, 320-400 nm) and 8-methoxypsorlan (8-MOP). This system is capable of inactivating 25-30 logs/hour of bacteria E. coli or S. aureus, 6 logs/hour of bacteriophage fd, 0.9 log/hour of bacteriophage R17, and 1.1 logs/hour of feline leukemia virus (FeLV) in PC. Immediately following 6 hours of PCD treatment, platelet integrity and function of PCD-treated and control PC were equivalent. After overnight storage, PCD-treated and control PC platelet properties were equal, but there was a slight reduction in TXB-2 production of PCD-treated PC compared to controls. Following PCD treatment, PC were stored for 48 to 96 hours. Platelet counts, morphology scores, extracellular LDH levels, aggregation response, dense body (db) content, and alpha granule (alpha g) content of PCD-treated and control PC were comparable. We assessed the ability of the PCD technique to inactivate intracellular and extracellular virus, quantified the degree of DNA adduct formation in contaminating lymphocytes, and measured the inhibition of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) mediated amplification of intracellular DNA. High titers of cell-free murine cytomegalovirus added to human platelet concentrates (final concentration 10(6)) were inactivated by PCD within 30 minutes. Cat renal fibroblasts infected at high levels with feline rhinotracheitis virus (FeRTV) were seeded into PC followed by PCD treatment with inactivation of 4.8 logs of FeRTV within 10 minutes. Purified human lymphocytes were seeded into PC and treated with PCD in the presence of 3H 8-MOP. Six hours of PCD treatment resulted in the formation of 9.3 to 12.8 8-MOP adducts per 1000 base pairs (bp) of DNA. PCR amplification of a 242 bp segment at the HLA-DQ alpha locus was examined. Inhibition of PCR DNA amplification was dependent on the numbers of 8-MOP adducts formed, and no amplification was present when greater than 12 adducts per 1000 bp were formed. These studies indicate that PCD can effectively inactivate high titers of cell-associated and cell-free virus seeded into standard human PC. The efficiency of DNA adduct formation can be quantitated, and the level of 8-MOP adduct formation in lymphocytes contaminating PC is comparable to the level of adduct formation in cellular DNA reported in the absence of platelets.","['Department of Laboratory Medicine, University of California, San Francisco 94143.']",['1R43HL39378/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This suggests that MC 540 may be useful for the inactivation of enveloped viruses in blood and blood products. The dye has a low acute systemic toxicity, is rapidly eliminated from the blood stream, and has little or no mutagenic potential. The currently available data support the view that MC 540-sensitized photo-inactivation interferes with early events in the infectious process, notably the ability of the virus to adhere to and penetrate its host cell.

ALL sharply peaks in incidence at ages three to four years. In the United States there have been persistent, unexplained increases in incidence of ALL in the past two decades. We hypothesize that exposure to photosensitizing lighting immediately after birth may be a contributing cause of ALL. Fluorescent lamps and other light sources with strong illumination, around 400 nanometers, are protoporphyrin-activating. Activation of protoporphyrin produces superoxides and free radicals that can induce breaks in DNA. In newborn nurseries in the US, the intensity of lighting has increased five- to 10-fold over the past two decades. Thus, protoporphyrin-activating light may be a contributing cause of childhood ALL. Additional retrospective and prospective studies should be undertaken of the relationship between exposure of newborns to protoporphyrin-activating illumination and the development of childhood ALL, along with in vitro studies of the hematologic effects of fluorescent lighting. Protoporphyrin-activating lighting is clearly not the sole determinant of ALL, but it could be a completely preventable cause. Inexpensive plastic filters could reduce these exposures substantially.","['Hubert H.

During long-term culture of Ml cells, however, some populations of the cells spontaneously become resistant to induces of cell differentiation. The isolated resistant variant cell lines have higher leukemogenicity than parent cells and produce differentiation inhibitory protein factors (I-factor). The variant cell lines are useful to studies on how leukemic cells are arrested in less differentiated stages even in the presence of differentiation inducers both in vitro and in vivo.

Marked excesses have not been reported in other countries. The increased leukemia rate around Sellafield has been further investigated by examining individual cases in detail in epidemiological cohort and case-control studies. The raised incidence seems to have been concentrated in children born in the local area but not among children who moved in after birth and was particularly associated with fathers who had experienced higher levels of occupational external ionizing radiation exposure at Sellafield before their children's conception. The underlying cause of this statistical association is not yet clear, but the findings have important potential implications for radiobiology and for protection of radiation workers and their children.","['MRC Environmental Epidemiology Unit, University of Southampton, Southampton General Hospital, UK.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

DNA analysis was applied to improve differentiation of CMPDs. All subtypes of CMPD analyzed, including chronic myeloid leukemia, agnogenic myeloid metaplasia, polycythemia vera, and essential thrombocythemia, had in common that granulocytes and bone marrow cells were clonal in origin, as shown by X chromosome-linked DNA polymorphism in conjunction with methylation patterns (n = 32). Reactive myeloproliferations, by contrast, showed polyclonal inactivation patterns. Clonality could not distinguish CMPD from cases of myelodysplastic syndrome because the latter (n = 7) also exhibited clonal hematopoiesis. Because of their clonal origin, peripheral granulocytes were used in all cases (n = 201) to detect bcr gene rearrangement. Despite possible morphologic overlap between different types of CMPD, bcr gene rearrangement was specific for chronic myeloid leukemia and could be applied to differentiate chronic myeloid leukemia from other CMPDs in cases of equivocal morphologic diagnosis. Chronic myeloproliferative disorders represent clonal hemopoietic diseases that probably have specific underlying genetic defects. Thus DNA analysis can aid substantially in the differential diagnosis of CMPD.","['Department of Pathology, Christian Albrechts University, Kiel, Federal Republic of Germany.']",,,,,['bcr-abl'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The French-American-British classification, established in 1976 and subsequently revised, allows only for the diagnosis of erythroleukemias whose immature elements are predominated by myeloid blasts, previously described as DiGuglielmo's syndrome. However, there is another form of erythroleukemia, in which the predominant immature elements are proerythroblasts, called DiGuglielmo's disease. To clarify this issue, 23 cases of erythroleukemia were reviewed and classified: 10 with a myeloblast predominance and 13 with a proerythroblastic predominance. These two forms of erythroleukemia can be distinguished on the basis of quantitative and qualitative morphologic features. When there were 30% or more proerythroblasts, calculated by dividing the total erythroid component into the proerythroblasts, there were few to no myeloblasts, no Auer rods, and increased cytoplasmic vacuoles; and myeloperoxidase staining was negative. The malignant proerythroblasts had increased block and blush periodic acid-Schiff positivity. The most frequent chromosomal abnormalities involved chromosomes 5 and 7. The patients with DiGuglielmo's disease had a median survival time of 2 months (range, 0.06 to 9 months), compared to a median of 16 months (range, 2 to 48 months), in patients with DiGuglielmo's syndrome. The erythroleukemia with the preponderance of proerythroblasts had a worse prognosis because many of the individuals did not survive long enough to respond to the therapy initiated. Erythroleukemia with 30% or more proerythroblasts should be included in the French-American-British classification because it behaves clinically and appears morphologically as an acute leukemia rather than a myelodysplastic syndrome.","['Department of Pathology, Loyola University Medical Center, Maywood, Illinois 60153.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In general, it appears that with respect to histocompatibility differences between donors other than HLA-matched siblings, there is an increased incidence of acute graft-versus-host disease, with the risk correlated with the degree of histoincompatibility. However, the overall disease-free survival is not always adversely affected, as a graft-versus-leukemia effect may counterbalance the increased death rate from graft-versus-host disease.

Similarly, the proportions of palmitic, palmitoleic, linoleic, ratios of linoleic to arachidonic and saturated to unsaturated fatty acids were significantly lower while the proportion of oleic, docosatetraenoic and docosahexenoic fatty acids were significantly increased in the retrovirus infected mice.

The synthesis of the 2',5'-difluoro analogues involved oxidation of the difluoronitrotoluene to 2,5-difluoro-4-nitrobenzoic acid followed by glutamation, reduction, and alkylation (propargyl bromide or MeI) to the diethyl N-(4-(alkylamino)-2,5-difluorobenzoyl)-L-glutamates. For the synthesis of the 2',3'- and 2',6'-difluoro compounds a new route was devised starting from methyl 4-((tert-butoxycarbonyl)amino)-2,6-difluorobenzoate and its 2,3-substituted counterpart. Treatment with NaH and then an alkyl halide introduced the N10-substituent. The methyl ester was hydrolyzed and the resulting acid was condensed with diethyl L-glutamate. The secondary amine was liberated using CF3CO2H and coupled with 6-(bromo-methyl)-3,4-dihydro-2-methyl-4-oxoquinazoline to yield the antifolate diesters. Final deprotection with mild alkali completed the synthesis in each case. The target compounds were tested as inhibitors of partially purified L1210 TS and also examined for their inhibition of the growth of L1210 cells in culture. Compared to their nonfluorinated parent compounds all the difluoro analogues were poorer inhibitors of TS. The greatest loss of enzyme activity was seen in the N10-propargyl analogues which contained one of the fluorine atoms ortho to the amine substituent. This loss was less apparent in the N10-methyl derivatives. Despite this lower inhibition of TS the majority of new compounds have equivalent cytotoxicity to their nonfluorinated predecessors.","['Drug Development Section, Institute of Cancer Research, Sutton, Surrey, England.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In order to determine the frequency of clinically significant cerebral fungal infection and define its clinical characteristics in a cohort of immunocompromised patients at high risk of fungal infection, the records of 118 patients with acute leukemia were examined for 57 clinical and laboratory features. The characteristics of 26 patients with systemic aspergillosis and acute leukemia were compared to 92 patients with acute leukemia in a control group. Eight of 118 patients (7%) had cerebral infection (seven Aspergillus, on Candida). Patients with systemic aspergillosis were more likely than patients in the control group to have focal neurologic findings (p = 0.02), confusion (p = 0.04), and abnormal computerized tomography (CT) of the brain characterized by single or multiple, enhancing or non-enhancing hypodense lesions (p = 0.02). Patients with systemic aspergillosis were more likely to die in complete remission than patients in the control group (p = 0.003); three of six patients with aspergillosis who died in remission expired as a consequence of cerebral infection. Cerebral infection complicated systemic Aspergillus infection in seven of 26 patients (27%), versus one of 16 patients with systemic Candida infection (6%) (p = NS). The authors conclude, therefore, that systemic aspergillosis complicating acute leukemia is more likely to be associated with confusion, focal neurologic findings, and abnormal CT scan of the brain, and that these findings suggest the presence of cerebral infection. In addition, cerebral infection commonly complicates the course of systemic aspergillosis, and is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with acute leukemia. A high index of suspicion is needed to insure early diagnosis and appropriate therapy, particularly in those who achieve remission of their leukemia.","['Department of Oncology, Albert Einstein Cancer Center, Bronx, New York.']",['CA P30CA1130/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These peaks are partially associated with monocyte subsets presenting different characteristics in terms of size, density, phenotypic markers, and [Ca2+]i mobilization responses. In the present study, we used the human promyelocytic leukemia cell line HL-60, at various times during differentiation with 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 [1,25(OH)2D3] toward the monocyte lineage, in order to study the relation of cell differentiation to responsiveness to PAF in terms of cytokine production. TNF production was induced by pretreatment with interferon gamma for 24 h and treatment with muramyl dipeptide. Although detectable TNF was produced by 4 day-differentiated cells, no effect was seen with PAF (10(-16)-10(-6) M) at this or earlier stages. In contrast, 5 day-differentiated cells had a comparable baseline production of TNF but responded with a 2.5-fold increase to PAF with a single peak, maximal at 10(-8) M. Moreover, 6 day- or 7 day-differentiated HL-60 cells showed a further increase in TNF production in response to PAF, and the response was bimodal, similar to that of the less dense subset of monocytes, with peaks at 10(-14) and 10(-7) M PAF. In parallel, undifferentiated HL-60 failed to respond to PAF in terms of [Ca2+]i mobilization. The earliest responsiveness to PAF (10(-7) M) was observed by 4 days of treatment with 1,25(OH)2D3, and by day 7 the response to PAF became bimodal (10(-14) and 10(-7) M). These results indicate that myeloid cells acquire, during maturation toward the monocyte lineage, a progressive responsiveness to PAF in terms of [Ca2+]i mobilization and enhanced cytokine production, and they suggest that the heterogeneity in responses to PAF observed in normal monocytes may be related to their stage of differentiation or maturation.","['Department of Pediatrics, Faculty of Medicine, University of Sherbrooke, Quebec, Canada.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Environmental factors, genetic predisposition, certain viral infections, and impairment of the developing immune system perhaps play a major role in the genesis of the most common disease forms, such as JCMMoL and the monosomy 7 syndrome. One intriguing finding in these disorders is the striking male predominance. Diagnostic difficulties occur because dysplastic manifestations of the hematopoetic systems are usually not as impressive as in adults and because myelodysplastic and myeloproliferative disease forms overlap considerably. Despite these problems, we believe that pediatric cases of MDS should also be classified according to the established FAB classification for MDS. However, as has already been proposed earlier by others, JCMMol clearly should be considered as a specific entity different from the adult form of CMMoL. As has been shown by cell culture studies, JCMMoL is characterized by the presence of neoplastic macrophage/monocyte progenitor cells. These cells produce several factors that result in autostimulation and suppression of normal hematopoiesis. MDS is a highly malignant disease in children and evolves to acute leukemia after a short period. During the early phase of the disease, supportive care is sufficient. If a compatible donor is available, BMT is the treatment of choice and should be performed during the early stage of disease progression after clinical remission is obtained with chemotherapy. If BMT is not feasible, intensive chemotherapy may improve the clinical condition and prolong survival. Preliminary data suggest that the incorporation of hematopoietic growth and/or differentiation factors in chemotherapy and BMT protocols may have some beneficial effects. The only way to accumulate sufficient data on MDS in children with respect to clinical features, prognosis, and efficacy of treatment is to follow a uniform diagnostic and treatment program. To achieve substantial improvements in the management of childhood MDS, multicenter trials will be essential.","[""St. Anna Children's Hospital, Vienna, Austria.""]",,,,143,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Abnormalities commonly seen in cultures of marrow from patients with MDS include decreased or absent colony growth, abortive cluster formation, and defective maturation of cells within the colonies. Although some investigators have defined growth patterns as ""leukemic"" and ""nonleukemic"" and have tried to correlate growth patterns with potential for evolution to acute leukemia, these methods are difficult to apply to any given case. Given the wide variety of techniques used to collect cells and the lack of standard sources for stimulating growth factors, the results, not surprisingly, have been inconclusive in predicting both prognosis and progression to acute leukemia. New methods by which clonogenic assays can be standardized, such as purification of the clonogenic cells and use of recombinant growth factors, should allow these assays to advance our understanding of MDS, develop new therapies, and predict responses to therapy in individual patients.","['Oregon Health Sciences University, Portland.']",,,,76,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The drug showed dose-dependent inhibition of cell growth, and this effect was cell-cycle phase-specific. Flow cytometric analysis indicated that the drug could retard-arrest the cells in late G2 phase or prophase and that it did not affect the progression from G1 to G2 phase. In the presence of MST-16, the change in 3H-thymidine incorporation was proportional to the retardation-arrest of the cells, suggesting that MST-16 has no direct action on DNA synthesis itself. MST-16 could continuously retard the cells which were arrested by etoposide (VP-16); and vincristine (VCR) could block the progression of the cells arrested by MST-16, but not vice versa. The addition of MST-16 followed by VCR was more effective than simultaneous addition of the 2 drugs on inhibition of cell growth.

Many different compounds are secreted from basophil granules upon appropriate stimulation. Products such as heparin, histamine, serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT), and membrane-derived materials which give rise to arachidonic acid metabolites, such as prostaglandins and leukotrienes, are some of the more important compounds released by mast cells. These compounds, when released after stimulation with a variety of molecules, such as IgE, specific antigen anaphylotoxin, as well as the compound 48/80 (C48/80) or calcium ionophore A23187, cause contraction of endothelial cells and mediate atopic or anaphylactic hypersensitivity. In this report, we study the generation of some arachidonic acid products, namely leukotrienes C4, D4, E4, and B4 and the prostaglandins D2 and E2 by rat peritoneal mast cells (RPMC), using calcium ionophore A23187 as a degranulating agonist. We have also studied the new lipoxygenase products, lipoxins A4 and B4, on RPMC secretion using C48/80 as a secretagogue. A rat basophilic leukemia cell line (RBL) was also used to compare results with RPMC. In this paper we have demonstrated that RPMC stimulated with A23187 release LTC4, LTD4, LTE4 and LTB4 and also PGD2 but not PGE2. These results were also confirmed when RBLs were used. In addition, we have shown that mast cells pretreated with LTC4, LTD4, LTE4 or 15-HETE do not modify the release of [3H]5HT exerted by C48/80 (0.5 microgram/ml) or A23187 (5 micrograms/ml). When LXA4 or B4 was used, mast cells were inhibited slightly (not statistically significant) from degranulating after the secretagogue treatment.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","['Immunology Division, University of Chieti, Italy.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Chromosomal in situ hybridization (or ""chromosome painting"") has been performed using Alu element-mediated PCR products from small quantities (250-500) of flow-sorted normal and abnormal chromosomes. Chromosome paints for various normal chromosomes, including 5, 6, 7, 14, 18, 19, 21, and 22, were generated and shown to be effective in the identification of the appropriate chromosomes. In addition, certain abnormal chromosomes, including a mental retardation-associated deletion chromosome 11 (q22-q23), the products of the constitutional translocation t(11;22), and the CML-associated t(9;22), were used to generate region-specific paints. In each case, the appropriate regions of the chromosomes were highlighted and this strategy is, therefore, well suited to the identification of previously unidentified marker chromosomes. A further direct consequence of this work is that chromosome paints specific for the common aberrant chromosomes, such as the Philadelphia chromosome, can be generated and made widely available. These may find particular use in the analysis of complex or masked chromosomal translocations.","['Department of Human Genetics, University Hospital Nijmegen, The Netherlands.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

At least three CH16LAR sequences exist and they are interspersed, in small clusters, over four regions that constitute more than 5% of the chromosome. CH16LAR sequences were observed in one unusually large cosmid contig (number 55), where the ordering of clones was difficult because these sequences led to false overlaps between noncontiguous clones. Contig 55 contains 78 clones, or approximately 2% of all the clones contained within the present cosmid contig physical map. Fluorescent in situ hybridization of multiple clones, including cosmid and YAC contig 55 clones, mapped the four CH16LAR-rich regions to bands p13, p12, p11, and q22. These regions are of biological interest since the pericentric inversion and the interhomologue translocation breakpoints commonly found in acute nonlymphocytic leukemia (ANLL) subtype M4 fall within these bands. Sequence analysis of a 2.2-kb HindIII fragment from a cosmid containing a CH16LAR sequence indicated that one of the CH16LAR elements is similar to a minisatellite sequence in that the core repeat is only 40 bp in length.

However, different relationships between the clinical response to IL-2 treatment and the LAK cytotoxicity have been reported using these three different target cells. The purpose of the present study was to evaluate whether the LAK cytotoxicities measured against these target cells represent similar effector-to-target-cell interactions, so similar conclusions may be drawn of 51Cr release assay results in which the cell lines are used as target cells. The cytotoxicity of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and PBMC depleted of different natural killer and T cell subsets was measured against the three targets. LAK cell recognition of targets was evaluated by cold target inhibition experiments, and the development of LAK-cell-mediated lysis with time was evaluated in 51Cr release assays of varying duration. This study shows that LAK-mediated lysis of T24 and Daudi cells was closely related and LAK cytotoxicity measured in 51Cr release assays against these two target cells may be measurement of similar effector-to-target cell interactions.","['Department of Tumor Cell Biology, Fibiger Institute, Danish Cancer Society, Copenhagen.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Light and electron microscopic examination and histochemical analysis indicated that the TI-1 cells were undifferentiated blast cells, but immunologic marker studies suggested that these cells had myeloid characteristics. The proliferation of TI-1 cells was dependent on the concentration of fetal bovine serum (FBS). Their doubling time was 13.8 hours when they were cultured in a medium containing 10% FBS. Phorbol-12 myristate 13-acetate (PMA) induced the TI-1 cells to differentiate into monocyte-like cells, as judged by their morphologic similarity to monocytes, their adhesion to the culture dish, and their increase of both nitroblue tetrazolium (NBT)-reducing ability and nonspecific esterase (NSE)-activity. PMA significantly inhibited the proliferation and DNA synthesis of TI-1 cells in a dose-dependent manner. The PMA-induced differentiation was significantly inhibited by the protein kinase C inhibitors (H-7, staurosporine). Hemin induced the TI-1 cells to differentiate into erythroid cells. The number of hemoglobin-producing cells and hemoglobin production was increased by hemin treatment. Hemin also inhibited the proliferation of the TI-1 cells. Thus, the TI-1 cell represents a bipotent, granulo-monocytoid, and erythroid cell line.

Cyclosporine A (CsA) has been reported to break tolerance to self and to induce killer cells with specificity against class II MHC (Ia) antigens both on the host and the tumor cells, resulting in a mild graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) in an autologous bone marrow transplantation (BMT) setting in the rat. We used these two agents in a syngeneic BMT model in a strain of mice that does not develop GVHD with CsA. Therapy with either agent alone was ineffective, whereas a combination of CsA plus IL-2 after BMT induced a potent graft-versus-tumor (GVT) effect against a melanoma and an acute myeloid leukemia. The antitumor effect could be adoptively transferred by infusing spleen cells harvested from mice treated with CsA plus IL-2 into secondary recipients that received chemoradiotherapy. The cytotoxicity of these cells was not influenced by treatment of tumor cells with gamma-interferon or Ia antibody. The cytotoxic effect was mediated by Thy 1+ and asialo GM 1+ cells. There was no GVHD either in the primary recipients of CsA and IL-2 or in those receiving the adoptively transferred spleen cells. Our findings show that combination therapy with CsA and IL-2 after syngeneic BMT induces a potent GVT effect in a non-MHC-restricted manner, and point to the existence of differences between the mechanisms of GVT and GVHD.","['Bone Marrow Transplantation Program, Georgetown University, Washington, DC.']","['CA01222/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA42962/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have found both GpIb alpha mRNA and protein in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC). In previously published work we reported that combined treatment with interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) markedly increased the GpIb alpha mRNA level in HUVEC. We have now documented that TNF-alpha alone induces GpIb alpha mRNA and protein expression, studied the kinetics of this response, and investigated potential mechanisms of the TNF-alpha effect. GpIb alpha mRNA induction by TNF-alpha is detectable as early as 2 hours after exposure to this cytokine, and reaches a maximal level after 20 to 24 hours. Using a nuclear run-on assay we found that GpIb alpha gene transcription is increased approximately 10-fold after 2 hours of TNF-alpha treatment. Furthermore, using two monoclonal antibodies that recognize different epitopes of GpIb alpha, we found that the protein expression in endothelial cells is markedly increased by TNF-alpha. Interleukin-1 (IL-1) and the phorbol ester phorbol myristate acetate, which mimic many effects of TNF-alpha on endothelial cells, have no effect on endothelial or human erytholeukemia (HEL)-cell GpIb alpha mRNA. TNF-alpha treatment for 24 hours increases the HEL cell GpIb alpha mRNA level approximately fourfold, showing a time- and dose-dependent effect similar to that seen in HUVEC. TNF-alpha-induced GpIb alpha mRNA and protein synthesis may play a role in mediating platelet or other cell interaction with activated endothelium. Unlike other endothelial pro-thrombotic and pro-adhesive proteins induced by TNF-alpha, GpIb alpha is not induced by IL-1 treatment, which suggests a novel pathway for induction of this protein.","['Cardeza Foundation for Hematologic Research, Department of Medicine, Jefferson Medical College of Thomas Jefferson University, Philadelphia, PA 19107.']","['AG 04861/AG/NIA NIH HHS/United States', 'HL09163/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL44956/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In humans, several allelic human-leukocyte antigen (HLA) associations also have been recognized. In addition to allelic associations, atypical HLA segregation patterns have been observed in leukemic families. These include a higher frequency of HLA-identical unaffected siblings, increased HLA homozygosity and increased maternal HLA-DR identity. These observations suggest preferential transmission of disease-associated haplotypes and a male transmission bias in leukemic families. The lack of disease-specific segregation, however, supports the idea that the HLA system is not directly relevant in leukemogenesis. Therefore, the existence of another genetic region linked to the MHC, causing segregation distortion, and containing recessive leukemia susceptibility genes may be postulated. The mouse t-complex would fit this model. This gene complex has recessive (semi-) lethal genes, is transmitted preferentially through fathers, and both the mouse t-complex and its rat homolog, growth and reproduction complex grc, confer susceptibility to carcinogenesis. This model could also explain the increased spontaneous abortion rate in mothers of leukemic patients, epidemiologic associations of leukemia with oral clefts and neuroectodermal tumors, and the transmission of a radiation-induced leukemia risk through fathers. Such segregation distortion might be the reason behind the maintenance of a gene(s) with a lethal effect in the population.","['Department of Haematology, Glasgow Royal Infirmary, UK.']",,,,104,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Increased RR was observed in subgroups for acute leukemia before five years of age and for lymphomas, especially in regions close to installations (less than 5 km) which started operation before 1970. Most of this increase was attributable to an unexpectedly low incidence in the control regions which could not be explained by analyzing possible confounding factors.

Our studies of 2 microns sectioned undecalcified plastic-embedded bone marrow (BM) from healthy human fetuses; normal adults; patients with acute myeloblastic leukemia (AML), acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), and chronic granulocytic leukemia (CGL) in various stages (chronic, accelerated, acute blastic phase, and after autografting); and patients recovering from therapy-induced marrow hypoplasia suggest that proliferative hematopoietic zones exist near the endosteum (endosteal marrow) and the vascular endothelium (capillary and sinus-lining endothelium) and a maturational zone distal to these regions. In some of these areas, morphologically recognizable hematopoietic cells were seen and interpreted as emerging and maturing in a sequential progression, suggesting an origin from the endosteal or endothelial progenitors. In other loci, early hematopoietic cells were seen in close contact with the endosteal or vascular endothelial (VE) cells. This latter relationship suggested that these areas of cellular contact were important and represented sites of cell to cell interaction that may be associated with the liberation of growth factors by endosteal and endothelial cells and their action on hematopoietic progenitor cells. Following treatment-induced hypoplasia, the endosteal and VE cells were seen to modulate, transform, and migrate into the surrounding empty and edematous marrow space as fibroblasts. Later, as hemopoietic regeneration began, clusters of regenerating hematopoietic cells were seen adjacent to bone trabecule (BT) and near the vascular endothelium. We postulate that endosteal and VE cells are the equivalent of embryonal-stage, undifferentiated mesenchyme and, under the appropriate regulatory influence, are capable of modulation and transformation (differentiation) into stromal (fibroblast-like) cells and precursors of hematopoietic cells in normal (physiologic) and stressed (pathologic) conditions. Recently, human endothelial cells have been shown to express a large number of cell surface antigens in common with hematopoietic (myeloid and lymphoid) cells. It is also possible that, in some situations, the VE cells act to establish a microenvironment and liberate growth factor(s), enabling pleuripotential and progenitor cell differentiation into mature hematopoietic cells adjacent to the vascular endothelium. Indeed, vascular endothelium has been shown to elaborate growth factors that participate in normal hematopoiesis.","['Department of Medicine, Roswell Park Cancer Institute, Buffalo, New York 14263.']",['CA42683/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

An association between occupational exposure to hair coloring products and hematopoietic cancers has been reported, but the risk for these cancers among users has not been carefully evaluated. METHODS: We conducted a population-based, case-control study with telephone interviews from 385 with telephone interviews from 385 non-Hodgkin's lymphoma cases, 70 Hodgkin's disease cases, 72 multiple myeloma cases, 56 chronic lymphocytic leukemia cases, and 1432 controls. RESULTS: Among women, use was associated with odds ratios of 1.5 for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, 1.7 for Hodgkin's disease, 1.8 for multiple myeloma, and 1.0 for chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Risk was higher for permanent hair coloring products than for semi- or nonpermanent products, particularly for dark colors. Long duration and early age of first use tended to increase risk, but the patterns were inconsistent. Use was much less common in men and did not significantly increase risk. CONCLUSIONS: The use of hair coloring products appears to increase the risk of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Multiple myeloma and Hodgkin's disease were also associated, although based on far fewer subjects. If these results represent a causal association, use of hair coloring products would account for 35% of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma cases in exposed women and 20% in all women.","['Occupational Studies Section, National Cancer Institute, Rockville, MD 20892.']",,['Am J Public Health. 1993 Apr;83(4):598-9.

The observed incidence was compared with expected numbers calculated from national incidence rates. For all cancer sites combined, the standardized morbidity ratio (SMbR) was 104. Among male gardeners a significantly increased incidence was seen for soft tissue sarcoma (SMbR = 526, 95% confidence interval (CI): 109-1,538), an chronic lymphatic leukemia (SMbR = 275, 95% CI: 101-599).

Patients were compared with non-8q24 patients for clinical and laboratory characteristics, response to therapy, and survival. The median age of patients with translocations involving 8q24 (71% males) was 40 years. Forty-three percent had lymphadenopathy, 29% splenomegaly, and 29% hepatomegaly. None exhibited central nervous system (CNS), skin, or gum involvement. These features did not differ significantly from non-8q24 ALLs. Patients with 8q24 translocations had higher hemoglobins (11.5 vs. 9.8 g/dl; P = 0.04) and lower percentage of blasts in the peripheral blood (8.5% vs. 69%; P = 0.007). Although all seven were finally categorized as ALL-L3, a marked variation in the proportion of typical L3 blasts was observed that initially resulted in the diagnoses of ALL-L2 in three cases and prolymphocytic leukemia in one. In five of five patients, the blasts typed as B cells (SIg+ and CD19+). Complete remission rates for patients with 8q24 translocations were 43%, whereas they were 68% for non-8q24 ALLS (P = 0.22). Furthermore, patients with 8q24 abnormalities exhibited significantly shorter survival (4.8 vs. 18.4 mo; P less than 0.001). We conclude that ALL with translocations of 8q24 in adults shows a mature B-cell immunophenotype (SIg+), poor prognosis and morphology ranging from classical ALL-L3 to ALL with a subpopulation of L3 cells. Thus, the diagnosis of ALL-L3 should be made when blastic cells possess a mature B-cell immunophenotype (SIg+) and an 8q24 translocation, even though the number of L3 cells is low.","['Department of Pathology, SUNY Health Science Center, Syracuse 13210.']","['CA37027/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA37055/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We wished to answer the question as to whether a different content of megakaryopoiesis in the bone marrow of CML patients has a prognostic significance for the development of myelofibrosis during the course of disease. In addition, the significance of possible changes in the quantity of megakaryopoiesis in this process was assessed. In 186 patients who had no fibre increase at first diagnosis, the rate of subsequent myelofibrosis varied from 19% for the common or granulocytic subtype (CML.CT) to 40% for patients with features of megakaryocytic increase (CML.MI). No significant differences were found either in the rapidity of progression to fibrosis or in the final rate of osteomyelosclerosis. Whereas in CML.MI most patients (75%) showed an increase of fibres only, this was accompanied by an additional increase of megakaryocytes in CML.CT, changing the histological pattern from CML.CT to .MI or .MP, respectively. The data therefore revealed a correlation between fibre increase and subtyping of CML as suggested by the Hannover classification of chronic myeloproliferative diseases. Subtypes of CML with megakaryocytic increase could be shown to present a ""pre-myelofibrotic"" stage of disease and may therefore be conceived as a particular pathway of acceleration.","['Pathologisches Institut, Medizinischen Hochschule Hannover, Federal Republic of Germany.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The feasibility of various methods (exposure to chemical agents, monoclonal antibodies (MoAbs), toxins, dye, magnetic microparticles ... ) has been confirmed. In allogeneic bone marrow transplantation, clinical studies have related the prevention of graft-versus-host disease reaction through the partial depletion of T lymphocytes in the donor graft limited to 1 log to maintain a graft-versus-leukemia (GVL) effect. Similarly, the feasibility of different assays (soybean agglutinin, Moabs and magnetic microparticles) have been shown. However, the clinical benefit of BM purging remains to be demonstrated. For ABMT, only recent data on B-cell lymphoma and leukemia strongly support the clinical usefulness of an ex-vivo purging.

New approaches such as cyclosporin--induced GVHD and IL-2 administration after autograft bring great expectations in this field. Colony stimulating factors and harvesting of peripheral stem cells help to reduce the duration of neutropenia. Finally, various techniques for marrow purging and hematopoietic cell isolation should make it possible to eliminate minimal residual disease.

It allows in some of these disorders to increase the number of cures above that obtained by conventional chemotherapy and in others to cure diseases never curable by chemotherapy. Allogeneic BMT, in addition, found more recently many promising indications in the field of genetic disorders of the cellular systems derived from the hematopoietic stem cell. Autologous BMT (ABMT) is also efficient in the majority of malignant hemopathies. Its efficacy however is limited mainly to that of high dose(s) of radiochemotherapy. The efficacy of ABMT thus appears lower than that of allo BMT but in terms of survival this disadvantage is more or less compensated by its lower lethal toxicity. Its efficacy in comparison with that of conventional chemotherapy is still under study. The lethality induced by BMT itself, the risk of mortality due to the disease, the age of the patient and the degree of resistance of the disease to conventional therapies are, among others, crucial parameters to take into consideration for each specific case and of which will depend the quality and the duration of the patient's survival.","[""Unite d'hematologie, Institut Jules Bordet, Bruxelles.""]",,,Les greffes de moelle osseuse.

The medians of the widths of the cortical sulci (P less than .001), insular cisterns (P less than .01), third ventricles (P less than .01), and frontal horns (P less than .05), and also of Evans' ratios (P less than .05) increased significantly after CNS therapy as compared with the findings at diagnosis in the patients who had received cranial irradiation. Most of these changes persisted during the follow-up. We conclude that the clinical value of CT scanning during therapy for ALL is restricted to patients with neurological symptoms or those who have undergone CNS irradiation.","['Department of Pediatrics, University of Oulu, Finland.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Decreases of ribonucleotide reductase activity and DNA synthesis by 42/6 were restored by the addition of ferric nitriloacetate.

Two patients underwent an allogenous BMT in relapse and died from progressive disease. In 13 children an allogeneic BMT was performed in first complete remission. One patient relapsed, two patients died from severe acute graft-versus-host disease, and two patients died from encephalopathy and cardiomyopathy. Eight of the 13 patients are living and well 18 months to eight and a half year after BMT. Seventeen patients received an autologous (unpurged) BMT. Four of them relapsed four to seven months after BMT. The disease free survival (DFS) for the 29 patients grafted in remission was 0.65. There was no statistical significant difference in DFS between patients with allogeneic and autologous BMT. We conclude that in children with AML and high risk for relapse BMT offers a real chance for better survival. Autologous BMT avoids the problems of graft-versus-host disease and of finding suitable donors for allogeneic marrow transplantation.","['Kinderklinik, Friedrich-Schiller-Universitat Jena.']",,,Ergebnisse der allogenen und autologen Knochenmarktransplantation bei Kindern mit akuter myeloischer Leukamie.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, we have evaluated the clinical effects of selective in vitro T-cell depletion of donor allogeneic bone marrow by using a single monoclonal antibody ([MoAb] anti-T12, CD6) and rabbit complement. This antibody recognizes mature T cells, but not other cellular elements such as natural-killer (NK) cells, B cells, and myeloid precursors. PATIENTS AND METHODS: From August 1983 to April 1991, 112 consecutive adult patients with hematologic malignancies underwent BMT with bone marrow from HLA-identical sibling donors. Marrow was harvested and depleted of mature T lymphocytes ex vivo by the use of three rounds of incubation with an anti-T12 antibody and rabbit complement. The preparative regimen consisted of cyclophosphamide and fractionated total body irradiation (TBI) in 108 patients. No patients received prophylactic immune suppression post-BMT. Purgation by anti-T12 was used as the only method for the prevention of GVHD. RESULTS: Twenty patients (18%) developed acute GVHD (grade 2 to 4); only eight patients developed chronic GVHD. The incidence of GVHD did not increase significantly with age. Only three of 112 patients (2.7%) exhibited acute graft failure. One patient developed late graft failure that was associated with cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection. Within the subset of 50 patients who had not previously undergone unsuccessful conventional therapy (acute leukemia in first remission or chronic myelogenous leukemia [CML] in stable phase), we estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method that the probability of disease-free survival was 50% at 3 years post-BMT, with a median follow-up of 44 months. The treatment-related mortality rate in this group was only 14% and was independent of patient age. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that selective in vitro T-cell depletion with an anti-T12 monoclonal antibody effectively reduces the incidence of both acute and chronic GVHD after allogeneic BMT without compromising engraftment. Moreover, depletion of CD6-positive cells from donor marrow obviates the need to administer immune suppressive medications to the majority of patients. This approach reduces the morbidity and mortality of allogeneic BMT and permits the BMT of older patients.","['Division of Tumor Immunology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA 02115.']","['K08-CA01105/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'N01-AI62531/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'P01-AI29530/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Newly diagnosed patients were given a daily infusion of CA (100 mg/m2) for 7 days and were assigned randomly to receive DNR (45 mg/m2) or IDR (12 mg/m2) daily for the first 3 days. Those patients who achieved a complete remission (CR) were given three consolidation courses that consisted of CA (100 mg/m2 intravenously [IV]) and thioguanine (TG; 100 mg/m2 orally) every 12 hours for 5 days and either DNR (50 mg/m2) or IDR (15 mg/m2) on the first day of each cycle. After consolidation, patients received late intensification, which consisted of the same drugs used for induction except that the CA was given for 5 days and the anthracycline for 2 days. Four courses were planned at 13-week intervals. RESULTS: The CR rates were 75 of 105 (71%) on the IDR arm and 65 of 113 (58%) on the DNR arm (P = .03). The median survival and median remission durations were 297 and 433 days, respectively, on the IDR arm. The median survival and median remission durations were 277 and 328 days, respectively, on the DNR arm. Six deaths occurred during late intensification, five on IDR and one on DNR; this approach was abandoned after 47 patients were entered. The median survival was significantly longer for patients who received late intensification. CONCLUSION: This trial demonstrated that IDR was more effective than DNR in remission induction in AML.","['Department of Medicine, Emory University, Atlanta, GA 30322.']","['CA-03013/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-03227/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-24456/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Twenty-one patients received six monthly courses of cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone (CHOP) and maintenance chemotherapy for 12 months. The LNH-84 protocol (30 patients) consisted of four courses of high-dose CHOP followed by consolidation for 4 months. Both FRALLE (22 patients) and LALA (seven patients) protocols were two intensive chemotherapy regimens for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) that included an induction with daunorubicin, vincristine, cyclophosphamide, prednisolone (and asparaginase for the FRALLE regimen), consolidation, and maintenance chemotherapy that lasted for 2 years. RESULTS: Sixty-six patients (82%) achieved a complete remission (CR). The CR duration rate and overall survival rate at 30 months were estimated to be 46% and 51%, respectively, with a median follow-up of 55 months. Only two of 37 relapses occurred after 26 months. Chemotherapy protocol did not influence CR rate, CR duration, and survival. A higher CR rate was associated with an age of less than 40 years, lactic dehydrogenase (LDH) level of less than two times the upper limits of normal, and no or one extranodal site of disease. Short survival was associated with a failure to achieve CR, age older than 40 years, B symptoms, LDH level more than two times the upper limits of normal, and hemoglobin level of less than 100 g/L. Bone marrow involvement had no prognostic value. We could not evaluate precisely the prognostic value of Ann Arbor stage because inclusion criteria differed among treatment groups. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that age and LDH are two important pretreatment prognostic factors for adult LBL, and that the optimal prognostic staging system remains a controversial issue.","['Service des Maladies du Sang, C.H.U., Lille, France.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This phenomenon was specific to mAb R1-20 because antibodies recognizing CD2, CD7, CD28, and HLA-ABC failed to exhibit homotypic cell aggregation. Induction of aggregation by mAb R1-20 occurred at 37 degrees C, but not at 4 degrees C and required cytoskeletal integrity. Sodium azide, a metabolic inhibitor, had no effect on the aggregation. Distinct from lymphocyte function-associated Ag-1/intercellular adhesion molecule-1 interaction in which divalent cations are essential elements, R1-20-mediated aggregation was not abolished with EDTA treatment. The R1-20 Ag was determined as a molecule of M(r) 100 to 110 kDa in immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting methods, under both reducing and nonreducing conditions. The molecular composition is quite different from that of any known integrin molecule. The R1-20 Ag was expressed on resting and activated T Lymphocytes as well as on normal B lymphocytes. Monocytes and granulocytes had no detectable R1-20 Ag.

The absence of a strict correlation between the two rearrangement events has been interpreted in favor of a stochastic switching mechanism in human B cells. Based on the accessibility model for the H chain class switch, we have considered an alternative explanation, namely, that transcriptional activation of more than one CH gene could render more than one isotype accessible for recombination. In order to test this possibility, we have stimulated a number of IgM-bearing B cell tumors and analyzed the transcriptional response of their unrearranged C gamma and C alpha H chain genes at the Ig class level by Northern hybridization and at the subclass level by RNA-RNA solution hybridization. Our data show that human clonal B cell populations can simultaneously express germ-line transcripts of both gamma and alpha genes. Our data also demonstrate a bias in the expression of the different isotypes in the B cell chronic lymphocytic leukemias analyzed, with the genes present with the first duplication unit of the H chain locus (gamma 3, gamma 1, and alpha 1) being expressed almost exclusively. These findings indicate that transcriptional activation of large chromosomal regions containing more than one CH gene could render all the genes available for recombination and, therefore, provide an explanation for the asymmetry in the rearrangement events that have previously been described in human B cell tumors. The possible relevance of our findings to the molecular mechanism of the H chain class switch is discussed.","['Unit for Applied Cell and Molecular Biology, Umea University, Sweden.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

At 0.5-1.0 microM CRS, 4 h exposure results in a reversible G2-phase block, while 24 h exposure results in greater than G2 polyploidy. At 5-10 microM CRS concentrations, cells exhibit persistent retardation of S-phase progression or irreversible G2 and/or greater than G2 blocks, depending on duration of exposure. Cells terminally blocked in G2 exhibit increased nuclear/cellular volumes and increased nuclear fluorescein isothiocyanate (protein) staining, suggestive of unbalanced growth. At 25-50 microM CRS concentrations, MELC exhibit severe membrane perturbation (loss of viability) regardless of exposure. In contrast, following similar exposures to an inactive isomer of CRS, MELC exhibit minimal cell cycle effects, suggesting that cell cycle kinetics may be a useful criterion for assessing potential efficacy. Similar analyses with different classes of chemotherapeutic agents reveal that the range of induced cellular/nuclear perturbations varies with the class of compound used. Taken together, these results suggest that drug toxicity can vary with both concentration and duration of exposure and, as such, a selective multiple-exposure FCM analysis may better represent the spectrum of drug action for drug development and pharmacodynamic studies.","['ManTech Environmental Technology, Inc., Research Triangle Park, North Carolina 27709.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Coupling of appropriate primary amines (17a--e, g--k) with phenacyl bromide (16) produced, after treatment with HCl, the corresponding N-substituted phenacylamine hydrochlorides (18a--e, g--k). A similar phenacylation of 4-amino-l-butanol (21) failed to give the desired compound 18f, so that 21 was heated with 2-bromomethyl-2-phenyl-1,3-dioxolane (20) at 150-155 degrees C for 3h to furnish, after treatment with HCl, the amino ketal hydrochloride 22 in 40% yield.

METHODS/RESULTS: Among them, 22 patients survived for less than 1 year: 10 of these had complex chromosomal abnormalities (complex aberrations), but only 5 of the remaining 75 patients who survived longer than 12 months did. Leukemia did not develop in approximately half of the patients who died within 1 year. The occurrence rate of leukemic transformation appears to depend on MDS subtypes rather than cytogenetic changes. In contrast, the percentage of patients who survived for less than 1 year is related to chromosomal changes, especially to complex aberrations. Of particular interest in this study is that 7 of 11 patients with MDS who had myelofibrosis survived for less than 1 year, and 5 of 7 patients with secondary MDS were included in this group showing a poor prognosis. By hematologic analysis, significant differences were found in the hemoglobin values and platelet counts of patients who survived for less than 1 year. CONCLUSIONS: From this analysis, three major risk factors for a poor prognosis were identified: complex aberrations, a history of chemotherapy or radiation therapy (secondary MDS), and development of myelofibrosis. The survival probability in the patients with MDS having at least one of these three factors was significantly low when compared with that in patients without these factors, indicating that cytogenetic analysis in combination with observance of certain clinical manifestations is important in therapeutic management of patients with MDS.","['First Department of Internal Medicine, Tokyo Medical College, Japan.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Additional immunologic and microscopic studies of the T-cells of the patient showed that they were large, agranular, CD4+ T-cells that also expressed the NK cell marker CD57. Cytogenetics disclosed an unusual karyotype in the PBL. CONCLUSIONS: The pathogenesis of this T-cell CLL and whether it truly represents a malignant disorder, as well as its relation to amyloidosis, is discussed.","['Department of Medicine, Mount Sinai Medical Center, New York, NY 10028.']","['CA48236/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'EY06337/EY/NEI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Based on interviews on occupational hazards and hobbies showing prolonged contact with pesticides (18 patients) and organic solvents (7 patients), 25 patients were categorized as ""exposed"". Thirty-four patients were categorized as ""unexposed,"", based on anamnestic findings. RESULTS: Light microscopic studies showed myelodysplasia involving multiple cell lineages in all assessable patients with professional exposure to pesticides and organic solvents, whereas morphologic aberrations of the non-blast cell population were confined to a minority of cells in unexposed patients. These findings were confirmed by electron microscopic studies in 31 patients. Immunologic analysis showed the presence of a minor megakaryoblastic component in six exposed patients and showed positive findings for the CD34 stem cell marker in 85% of exposed patients, a figure significantly higher as compared with that for unexposed subjects. Cytogenetic studies confirmed the frequent occurrence of 5q and/or 7q aberrations in patients occupationally exposed (10 of 25 cases). Other recurring chromosome aberrations in the exposed group were 17p-, trisomy 11q, and translocation of 16q, 6p, 7p, and 11p, whereas the classic AML-specific translocations (i.e., t[15;17]; t[8;21]) were detected only in unexposed subjects. Conventional chemotherapy achieved complete remission in 1 of 19 exposed patients, as opposed to 14 of 29 unexposed patients, with a median survival of 2 months in the former group and 8 months in the latter. CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, these findings document that AML in patients professionally exposed to toxic substances may represent a distinct cytogenetic and clinicopathologic entity. The clinicobiologic characteristics in these exposed patients are similar to the features of AML arising in patients with prior chemotherapy for another tumor, thus suggesting that similar transformation pathways may underlie leukemogenesis induced by cytotoxic drugs and by environmental exposure to some pesticides or organic solvents.","['Institute of Hematology, University of Ferrara, Italy.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Allergic reactions occurred in 31 of 125 patients (24.8%) treated with weekly high-dose (25,000 IU/m2) intramuscular E. coli asparaginase and necessitated discontinuation of the drug. METHODS: The authors evaluated the toxic effects of Erwinia asparaginase in the 31 children who had allergic reactions to the E. coli preparation. RESULTS: Subsequent allergic reactions to Erwinia asparaginase occurred in 7 of the 31 children (22.6%). In contrast to previous reports with intravenous administration, most allergic reactions to both asparaginase preparations were characterized by mild urticaria that responded to use of diphenhydramine; none of the reactions was life-threatening. CONCLUSIONS: In summary, the authors found Erwinia asparaginase to be an acceptable substitute for E. coli asparaginase for most children who had allergic reactions. Through the use of both E. coli and Erwinia asparaginase, 94% of children could receive their intended asparaginase.","['Department of Pediatric Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA 02115.']",['CA 34183/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have examined the possible cause-and-effect relationship between aztreonam and TEN. PATIENTS: The first patient was a 23-year-old man with acute lymphocytic leukemia receiving a BMT from a related mismatched donor. He experienced profound conjunctivitis and superficial bulla covering 60 percent of his body surface area (BSA). The second patient, a 32-year-old man with lymphoma, received a BMT from a matched unrelated donor. He exhibited lymphocytosis, acute conjunctivitis, and bullous lesions covering 60 percent of his BSA. INTERVENTIONS: Aztreonam was discontinued in both patients. The first patient was treated with pigskin grafting and the second was treated with topical silver sulfadiazine. RESULTS: Despite stabilization of symptoms, both patients eventually died of infectious complications. CONCLUSIONS: Histological data in both patients were more consistent with TEN than graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) in that dermal infiltrates were sparse or absent. The onset of cutaneous symptoms was of more acute onset than acute GVHD, and ocular complaints are uncommon in acute GVHD. Furthermore, the onset of TEN bore a closer temporal relationship to aztreonam than to other drugs administered.","['Bone Marrow Transplant Unit, Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center, Seattle, WA 98108.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The NK activity of patients' LAK cells on K562 was significantly lower than that of a group of healthy donors whereas no differences were found in LAK activity as evaluated on Daudi cells. Three of 5 AML and 3 of 4 ALL were significantly more susceptible to autologous and allogeneic LAK lysis when blasts obtained at relapse were compared with leukemic cells of the same patients at diagnosis.

The patients were given a concentrated preparation of the gargle solution which they had to dilute 50 times, and were asked to use it 8 times/day for one year. Twenty patients (76.9%) frequently suffered from stomatitis despite the gargling. Therefore, in the second year they were instructed to use the gargle solution at a higher concentration (30-fold dilution). On the third year, they were asked to increase the frequency of gargling to 10 times/day; this resulted in a significant decrease in frequency of the episodes of stomatitis.

We would like to stress the fact that the clinical spectrum of LH should include BMB, which, however, in most cases must be considered a differential diagnosis. Regarding cutaneous congenital LH, an eponymic classification (LSD, HPLH) is difficult to follow strictly, because overlapping pictures are observed. There is a wide spectrum of cutaneous congenital LH. The main problem at birth is the lack of prognostic criteria. Neither the presence of the rash at birth, nor its type and extension, is necessarily evidence of risk of systemic disease. Cases of HPLH involute, as also do cases of cutaneous LSD, and the ""Blueberry Muffin"" type of LH; overlapping clinical aspects exist.

Low levels of TPK were measured in mononuclear cells from active AML and CLL patients.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Thirty-one consecutive adults with SAA who satisfied the age criteria for allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (BMT) (age less than 51 years) were treated with ATG 20 mg/kg/day for 10 days along with high-dose corticosteroids. Patients with an HLA-identical donor received a transplant if they did not respond to ATG or if they developed life-threatening complications during or soon after ATG administration. Eight patients with no response to ATG were also treated with oral cyclosporine 12.5 mg/kg/day. RESULTS: Eleven patients had a complete and five a partial response to ATG; two patients improved with cyclosporine treatment, resulting in an overall response rate of 58% to immunosuppression. Nine of 14 patients with donors received a BMT: seven because they did not respond to ATG and two because of serious infections. Seven grafts were obtained from related and two from unrelated donors. There was no significant difference in survival between those with and without a related HLA-identical donor (log-rank p value = 0.969). At a median follow-up of 58 months, 26 of 31 are alive with an actuarial survival of 80% at 5 years. Two patients died of infection, two died from complications of BMT, and one remains transfusion-dependent. One patient died of refractory leukemia at 30 months; one patient relapsed with hypoplasia 95 months after initial therapy with ATG. He showed a complete response to treatment with cyclosporine. No other late hematologic events have occurred. CONCLUSIONS: This treatment approach resulted in the restoration of hematopoiesis and independence from transfusion in 80% of patients with SAA entered into the study. The efficacy of allogeneic BMT in salvaging cases in which ATG failed does not appear to be compromised.

These mutant cell lines, R78 and R107, showed low src-kinase activity, but retained wild-type transforming retrovirus, suggesting that a cellular gene involved in viral gene expression was mutated. Southern and Northern hybridization analyses showed that the expression of viral mRNAs from the integrated proviral DNA was reduced in these mutant cells. DNA transfection experiments with various transforming genes and promoters revealed that the mutant cell lines were resistant to transformation by transforming genes expressed under the long terminal repeat (LTR) of Moloney murine leukemia virus (Mo-MuLV). In contrast, these cell lines could be efficiently transformed by the same transforming genes with human metallothionein promoter, polyomavirus promoter-enhancer, and c-H-ras promoter. Transient expression assays using plasmids containing the CAT gene under the LTR of Mo-MuLV also showed that CAT activity expressed under the LTR in these mutant cells was lower than that in the parental cell line, No. 7. These results suggest that cellular mutations of R78 and R107 cells affect specific transcription from the LTR of Mo-MuLV. Studies using various constructs of the LTR CAT indicated that the region responsible for the repression was located in a fragment (-328 to -150) of the LTR containing the 72-bp repeat enhancer. Somatic cell hybridization experiments showed that the mutant phenotype of these mutant cell lines is dominant to that of the parental cell line.","['Department of Tumor Virology, Osaka University, Japan.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Sequence analysis of the LTR of this New Guinean isolate, designated as HTLV-I(PNG-1), indicated a sequence divergence of 8.4% to 10.4% from prototype Japanese HTLV-I(ATK) and other HTLV-I and STLV-I isolates and 48.6% diversity from HTLV-II. Few mutations were found in the core elements of the transcriptional enhancer regions, the TATA box promoter, and the polyadenylation signal and site. Further, the observed changes did not significantly alter the inferred stability of the Rex response element, a stem loop structure critical for polyadenylation and Rex protein binding. Dendograms based on LTR sequences indicated that the strain of virus that evolved into HTLV-I(PNG-1) diverged from the other PTLV in the distant past, just after the progenitors of STLV-I from Asia, but before the ancestors of STLV-I from Africa. By contrast, other HTLV-I isolates were found to represent strains of virus that have diverged more recently and clustered primarily according to their geographical origin. These data confirm that HTLV-I(PNG-1) is a new and distinct variant of the PTLV group. Also, our analyses suggest that both HTLV-I and STLV-I may have originated in the Indo-Malay region and eventually spread to Africa and then to the New World and Japan with horizontal transmission between man and nonhuman primates possibly occurring over thousands of years.","['Department of Medicine, State University of New York, Syracuse 13210.']",['R01HL43602-01/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,['GENBANK/M85207'],,,,,,,,,,,,

The FPIA and RIA values were highly correlated (r = 0.93) and on the average CsA concentrations measured by FPIA were 1.56 times higher than those measured by RIA. Ten patients developed renal dysfunction and 10 developed grades II-IV acute GVHD. Although univariate analysis showed that plasma CsA concentrations measured by either FPIA or RIA were significantly correlated with renal dysfunction, the association was stronger with FPIA. Plasma CsA concentrations measured by FPIA but not RIA remained a significant risk factor for renal dysfunction in a multivariate relative risk model. Amphotericin therapy was significantly associated with renal dysfunction in the univariate analysis but not in the multivariate analysis. No significant associations were found between whole blood CsA or CsA M1 concentration, patients' age, gender, or CsA dose and the risk of renal dysfunction.

The point source of exposure investigated is a large microwave tower located southwest of the center of the city (Sutro Tower).

It is one of the most effective treatments for acute and chronic leukemias. In this paper we discuss the clinical and radiobiological features relative to TBI methods and to the kind of BMT. Graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) incidence is decreased by the depletion of T-lymphocytes from donor's bone marrow which causes high rates of rejection and relapses. Thus, more aggressive conditioning regimens are necessary than unmanipulated BMT. The results are also examined of different experimental and clinical trials on the immunohematological features of T-depleted BMT and the radiobiological behavior of normal and pathological target tissues due to different methods of TBI. We report the experience of the Perugia Bone Marrow Transplantation Unit and Radiation Oncology Service. We treated 54 patients suffering from acute leukemia (AL) and 34 cases with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) with T-depleted allogeneic HLA-identical BMT. Three different conditioning regimens were employed in an effort to enhance cytoreduction and immunosuppression without significantly increasing extramedullary toxicity. TBI was administered according to a hyperfractionated scheme of 3 fractions a day for 4 days. The third conditioning regimen, including also thiothepa (TT), gave the best results in terms of stable uptake and leukemic cells eradication. Disease-free survival (DFS) is 55.5% in the patients with AL at a median follow-up of 40 months; in the patients with CML who were not treated with TT, DFS is 10% at a median follow-up of 60 months, while it is 66.6% at a median follow-up of 12 for the group of patients who received also TT. The conditioning regimen with hyperfractionated TBI, Cy and TT was effective and well tolerated; 12.5% of patients developed interstitial pneumonia.","['U.O.

The diagnosis of spinal involvement is currently made by means of conventional radiography in postero-anterior and lateral views. The osteolytic lesions of the vertebral body present with collapse of the vertebral plates in a wide range of severity. Body evaluation is usually made by comparison with the adjacent vertebrae. Since leukemia is a systemic disease, several vertebrae are possibly involved in each case. In the attempt to develop a more sensitive method, which is less dependent on observers' evaluation, a quantitative and comparative analysis of vertebral bodies was performed. The radiographs in lateral view of the dorsal and lumbar spine of 14 children with ALL were analyzed: previous radiological reports suggested the lesion of one or more vertebral bodies. The area of each vertebral body was measured and digitalized by means of a backlighted graphic table and of a software developed to this purpose. The criteria to define the collapse of a vertebral body were the ratio between areas of adjacent vertebral bodies, in conformity to the anatomic and radiographic principle that, in the dorsal and lumbar spine, the body of a normal vertebra is equal to or bigger than that of the upper one. The data obtained by quantitative analysis were compared with conventional radiologic reports. A hundred and fifty-five vertebrae were analyzed by computerized analysis; 17 (10.9%) vertebrae, undetected at conventional analysis, were collapsed. This method allows a more precise diagnosis of collapsed vertebral lesions; its accuracy can be improved with further development of digital technology.","['Clinica Ortopedica e Traumatologica, II Facolta di Medicina e Chirurgia, Universita, Pavia.']",,,Valutazione radiografica diretta e computerizzata delle localizzazioni vertebrali nei bambini affetti da leucemia linfatica acuta.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Following the operation, radiation in total dose of 35.5 Gy was given to the whole brain, and there was also left intraventricular administration of methotrexate (MTX) and cytosine arabinoside (ara-C). The treatment resulted in the complete disappearance of the intraparenchymal mass apart from small calcifications.

As shown herein, rapid protein synthesis is evident in K562 erythroleukemic cells upon exposure to sublytic complement doses. Analysis of cell extracts by SDS-PAGE revealed high molecular weight proteins which appeared in the cells already after 15 min treatment with complement at 37 degrees C, reaching a maximal level after 40-50 min. These large complement-induced proteins (L-CIP) were clearly observed in gels stained by Coomassie blue and in autoradiograms following [35S]-Met or [3H]-Leu incorporation. Rabbit antibodies prepared against L-CIP were reactive in immunoassays with extracts of MAC-treated cells but not of non treated cells. They also bound to the surface of intact K562 cells (as determined by immunofluorescence), but only after treatment of the cells with complement. Both heterologous (rabbit and guinea pig) and homologous (human) sera induced L-CIP synthesis. The induction of L-CIP was indeed mediated by the complement MAC since L-CIP could not be detected in K562 cells exposed to heat-inactivated human serum or C6-deficient rabbit serum. Similarly, C7- or C8-deficient human sera could not induce L-CIP production unless they were reconstituted with purified human C7 or C8, respectively. The synthesis of L-CIP was largely inhibited by the protein synthesis inhibitors cycloheximide and puromycin and partially inhibited by the RNA synthesis inhibitor actinomycin D. L-CIP was similarly induced in two other human leukemic cell lines, U937 and HL-60, but not in K562/S, a subline of K562 which is highly sensitive to complement damage. These results are discussed with respect to the resistance of leukemic cells, and nucleated cells in general, to complement-mediated immune damage.","['Department of Chemical Immunology, Weizmann Institute of Science, Rehovot, Israel.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here we show that IL-2 and IL-3 regulate the activity of specific members of the SRC-family of non-receptor protein tyrosine kinases (PTKs). In IL-2-dependent T-cell lines, IL-2 induced rapid and transient increases in the activity of the p56-LCK kinase without influencing the activities of other SRC-like PTKs (p59-FYN, p62-YES) in these T-lymphocytes. In contrast to IL-2's effects on p56-LCK in T-cells, studies of an IL-2-responsive cell line of the B-cell lineage that lacks p56-LCK revealed that IL-2 specifically regulates the activity of the p53/56-LYN kinase. Thus, some flexibility exists in the ability of various SRC-like PTKs to functionally couple to IL-2 signalling pathways. In several IL-3-dependent myeloid-committed leukemic cell lines, IL-3 was found to specifically regulate the activity of the p53/56-LYN kinase without affecting the activities of other SRC-like PTKs (p59/64-HCK, p59-FYN, p62-YES) in these hematopoietic cells. This finding that p53/56-LYN can be regulated by both IL-2 in B-lineage cells and IL-3 in myeloid-committed cells demonstrates that the same SRC-family PTK can participate in signal transduction events mediated via two independent receptor systems. Taken together, our findings imply that the specific combinations of lymphokine receptors and SRC-like PTKs available for coupling with those receptors are coordinately controlled during the differentiation of hematopoietic cells.","['University of Pennsylvania, Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Philadelphia.']","['CA-47589/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-54957/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Altogether, human endogenous retroviruses and retroviral elements are estimated to comprise at least 0.1 to 0.6% of the human genome. Like other transposable elements they may contribute in shaping the eukaryotic genome by intracellular transposition events or by generating hot spots of recombination. Human retroviral sequences have been shown to be transcriptionally active, especially in human placenta and embryonic tissue and in human tumor cell lines. Some elements that are coexpressed with cellular sequences are supposed to play a role in regulation of gene expression. Furthermore, expression of human endogenous retroviral sequences may have a protective function against superinfection by related exogenous retroviruses. On the other hand, endogenous retroviruses and retroviral elements represent a cellular reservoir of possibly pathogenic retroviral genes. They may be involved in chromosomal aberrations by acting as sites for recombination events between different chromosomes. Furthermore, they can act as insertion mutagens and activate or inactivate cellular genes. Retroviral gene products themselves may also be pathogenic as has been shown for the immunosuppressive effects of p15E envelope proteins. Therefore, the role of human endogenous retroviruses and retroviral sequences in biological processes is currently a subject of great interest.","['III.

This work has been performed by culturing wild-type clinical strains of HIV-1 as well as the HIV-3b laboratory strain of this virus under such conditions. The ID50 values obtained for the resistant viruses thus generated vary between 50-100 times above those of the parental wild-type strains in each case. Furthermore, we have identified several new mutation sites in the HIV-1 pol gene that are responsible for the observed resistance to AZT and ddI. We have not succeeded, however, in generating drug-resistant strains of HIV-1, under conditions in which several compounds or anti-viral agents were simultaneously present during the in vitro selection process. Combinations of drugs which failed to yield drug-resistant variants included AZT plus ddI, AZT plus alpha-interferon, and ddI plus alpha-interferon.

Curiously, in human leukemia, this does not usually result in autonomous growth when assessed in clonal in vitro cultures. Depending on gene programming, in particular in human or murine myeloid leukemias, the hemopoietic growth factors can also suppress the leukemic population by inhibiting the capacity of the leukemic stem cells for self-generation. The regulator showing the highest suppressive activity varies from leukemia to leukemia, with G-CSF. GM-CSF, IL-6, or leukemia-inhibitory factor (LIF) all having high activity on appropriate target cells. Combinations of these regulators are more effective than single agents alone. Analyses of human HL60, U937 and murine M1 leukemic models indicate that the development of morphological maturation in the leukemic cells is not a necessary feature of stem-cell suppression. LIF has an anomalous action on stem-cell self-generation, being highly effective in the suppression of certain myeloid leukemic cell lines, but being necessary to maintain self-generation in normal embryonic cells. This suggests the existence of a common control medium governing self-generation decisions in cells of different lineages, but that the outcome of the decision is determined by the differentiation program operating in different cells. The colony-stimulating factors are being used in combination with chemotherapy in the treatment of patients with acute myeloid leukemia, but the above principles require caution in certain situations.","['Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, Royal Melbourne Hospital, Victoria, Australia.']",,,,15,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

TAPs were secreted as glycoproteins by 6m2 cells grown at 33 degrees C, but not by 6m2 cells grown at 39 degrees C. The identity and functions of TAPs were previously unknown. By molecular cloning techniques and immunoscreening, we have isolated two different cDNA clones (34A and 79B3) that were found by Western blot analysis to code for an anti-TAP monoclonal antibody-reactive polypeptide of approximately 58,000 daltons. The nucleotide sequence of 34A cDNA was determined and found to be identical to that of rat transin-2. The deduced amino acid sequence of 34A shares 71% sequence identity with rat transin and 41% to 76% identity with three human metalloproteinases. Partial nucleotide sequencing data indicated that 79B3 may be the rat transin gene. When either 34A cDNA or 79B3-cDNA was used as a probe in Northern blot analysis, one mRNA band of approximately 1.9 kb was detected in 6m2 cells at the permissive temperature of 33 degrees C. Similar RNA was either not detected or detected at very low level in 6m2 cells grown at the non-permissive 39 degrees C. These results suggest that at the non-permissive 39 degrees C, these two genes were not transcribed at the same level as that at 33 degrees C. Zymogram further confirmed that P64 and P68 have metalloproteinase activities. Apparently, the two proteins which we formerly designated TAPs are members of the rat transin gene family. Therefore, within v-mos transformed 6m2 cells, the absence of TAPs (metalloproteinases) at the non-permissive temperature was due to the very poor transcription of the two rat transin genes. This article presents a review of the biochemical properties of TAPs and their eventual identification as rat transin-2 and transin.","['Department of Tumor Biology, University of Texas, M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston 77030-4009.']",,,,34,['v-mos'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

T cells, particularly CD4+ helper T cells, play a key role in the pathogenesis of the disease induced by ts1. Therefore, ts1 is unique among the described murine retroviruses in its ability to afflict both the central nervous system (CNS) and the T-cell compartment of the immune system in the same host. This particular ability to cause degenerative diseases involving both the CNS and immune system is shared by the lentiviruses responsible for development of the acquired immunodeficiency syndromes of humans and macaques. Our goal has been to elucidate the specific cellular and molecular mechanisms that underlie this neuro- and immunopathogenicity of ts1. We have previously reported that the primary neuropathogenic determinant of ts1 maps to a single amino acid substitution, Val-25-Ile, in the precursor envelope protein gPr80env. Further, at the restrictive temperature, the Val-25-Ile substitution did not prevent oligomerization of the gPr80env proteins; however, the structure of the oligomer was incompetent for transport from the ER to the Golgi. These findings suggest that the cytopathic effect of ts1 in neural cells might be due to accumulation of the gPr80env oligomers in the ER. Since glial cells are targets of ts1 infection in vivo, primary astrocytic cultures were established and the cytopathic effect of ts1 and MoMuLV-TB on these cells assessed. Both viruses replicate well in astrocytes and their replication is cytopathic, albeit to different degrees. The ts1 mutant appears to produce greater cell killing than the wild-type virus. Furthermore, it was found that the rate of processing of gPr80env of ts1 in astrocytes is slower than that of MoMuLV-TB. Therefore, the inefficient transport and processing of gPr80env of ts1 appears to correlate with its cytopathic effect in these cells. Electron microscopic studies of the ts1-infected astrocytes revealed large numbers of aberrant particles in the ER. The in vitro cytopathic effect of ts1 on astrocytes may reflect what happens in vivo. An indirect mechanism of neuronal-cell killing by ts1 is proposed.","['University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Science Park, Research Division, Smithville 78957.']",,,,,['env'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Most techniques suffer from a lack of general applicability to all DNA sequences, poor sensitivity, requirement for RNA samples rather than DNA, or necessity for performing DNA sequencing to uncover unknown point mutations. Recently, Montandon, et al. (8) described a novel method whereby segments of DNA amplified by the Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) can be rapidly screened for mutations through their formation of heteroduplexes with an end-labeled reference DNA followed by site-specific chemical cleavage at mispaired bases. Here we have applied this PCR-mismatch technique to a portion of the BCL-2 gene, using DNA samples derived from the biopsy specimens of patients with lymphomas or lymphocytic leukemias. The BCL-2 gene becomes activated through a t(14;18) chromosomal translocation in the majority of non-Hodgkin's lymphomas. Somatic point mutations were detected in the BCL-2 genes of 3 of 5 patient samples that contained a t(14;18). No mutations were observed for lymphomas lacking a t(14;18), nor in the DNA of over 20 normal persons. Further analysis excluded the possibility that the detected mutations represented hereditary polymorphisms or PCR-artifacts. Based on comparisons with direct DNA sequencing, the PCR-mismatch technique appeared to be both highly specific and sensitive. The possible mechanisms responsible for these somatic mutations in translocated BCL-2 genes and their functional significance are discussed.","['University of Pennsylvania, Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Philadelphia 19104.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The subsequent increase of AcSDKP levels seem to indicate a feedback mechanism which should permit the reestablishment of homeostasis in the stem cells.

Cytogenetic analysis of MKPL-1 revealed a model chromosome number of 92 with abnormal chromosomes including those found in the patient's bone marrow cells. Furthermore, MKPL-1 cells were serially transplanted into nude mice for nine passages with production of lethal tumors and leukemic manifestation.

The complete remission (approximately 90%) and 3-year event-free survival rates (approximately 40%) were similar in the three treatment groups. However, the pattern of extramedullary relapse varied according to specific treatment regimen. Patients who received LSA2L2 therapy with less intensive intrathecal chemotherapy and no radiotherapy had a central nervous system (CNS) relapse rate (i.e. isolated CNS +/- other site) of over 20%, compared to only 10% for patients receiving the same systemic chemotherapy with intensified intrathecal therapy and radiotherapy, and less than 5% for those receiving T-cell 2 therapy.

An adaptive control dosing algorithm was used to maintain HMBA steady-state concentrations (Css) within a narrow therapeutic window (1-2 mM) for five days every four weeks. Despite achieving the target HMBA Css during at least two courses in each of 15 patients, HMBA did not produce clinically relevant improvements in blood cell counts nor in other functional indices. Instead, HMBA induced cytopenias in the majority of these patients, most of whom had preexisting cytopenias and limited hematopoietic reserves. These disappointing results correlated with concurrent in vitro bone marrow studies from these patients in which both the HMBA concentrations that were optimal for differentiation in vitro (2-5 mM) and the HMBA Css that were achieved in this study (1-2 mM) substantially inhibited the growth of granulocyte-macrophage colony-forming units and erythroid burst-forming units. Although the mechanism responsible for the anti-proliferative effects of HMBA on hematopoietic progenitors (cytotoxicity versus terminal differentiation) could not be determined, the induction of cytopenias and lack of significant clinical improvements suggest that HMBA is cytotoxic and will not be useful alone as a differentiating agent on this schedule of administration in the treatment of MDS.","['Johns Hopkins Oncology Center, Johns Hopkins Medical Institutions, Baltimore, Maryland 21205.']",['N01-CM-57738/CM/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Seventy-one patients had evaluable metaphase spreads in remission marrows and 20 (28%) had one or more abnormal metaphases identical to that present in the pretreatment marrow.

Thus there was a 49% false negative rate of this study. These data indicate that the failure to detect residual chromosomally abnormal cells in the bone marrow does not guarantee continuous complete remission. Cytogenetic study was most useful in the favorable cytogenetic groups and least useful in the unfavorable groups. The persistence of normal metaphases in pretreatment marrows did not affect outcome or risk of recurrence. Twenty-five of 34 evaluable patients who relapsed after remission had either the identical cytogenetic abnormality present in the pretreatment marrow or showed the identical abnormality with additional chromosomal changes.

Our results indicate that amino acids 57 to 67 are critically important for Rex function mediated through the RxRE cis-acting RNA sequence. Within this domain, only amino acids 61 to 63 could be mutated without loss of function. All other missense and deletion mutants yielded dominant-negative proteins.

Rex acts by specifically binding to RNAs containing sequences of the R region of the 5' long terminal repeat. Two forms of Rex detected in HTLV-II-infected cells, p26rex and p24rex, differ in the extent of serine phosphorylation. Two-dimensional phosphopeptide analysis indicates that p26rex is extensively phosphorylated at multiple sites. Using a sensitive immunobinding assay, we show that the phosphorylation state of Rex determines the efficiency of binding of Rex to HTLV-II target RNAs. Thus, the phosphorylation state of Rex in the infected cell may be a switch that determines whether virus exists in a latent or productive state. These studies also suggest that phosphorylation of RNA-binding regulatory proteins is a more general mechanism of gene regulation.","['Department of Medicine, University of California, School of Medicine, Los Angeles.']",['CA38597/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,PMC241238,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In patients exposed to nitrous oxide, increase in plasma homocysteine is a responsive indicator of cob(I)alamin inactivation. In the present work, we measured the inactivation of methionine synthase and the concurrent homocysteine export rate of two murine and four human cell lines during nitrous oxide exposure. When cultured in a standard medium with high content (2.3 microM) of folic acid, the methionine synthase of all cell types was inactivated at an initial rate of 0.05 to 0.14 h-1. The inactivation curves leveled off, and a residual activity of 15 to 45% was observed after 48 h of nitrous oxide exposure. The rate and extent of the nitrous oxide-induced inactivation were markedly reduced when the cells were transferred and cultured (greater than 10 days) in a medium containing low concentration (10 nM) of 5-methyltetrahydrofolate. The methionine synthase inactivation increased in a dose-dependent manner when the 5-methyltetrahydrofolate content of the medium was increased from 3 nM to 2.3 microM. The inactivation of methionine synthase was associated with a marked enhancement of homocysteine export rate of murine fibroblasts and a moderate increase in export from two human glioma cell lines. In contrast, in three leukemic cell lines (murine T-lymphoma R 1.1 cells, human promyelocytic leukemia HL-60 cells and human acute myelogenous leukemia KG-1a cells), the homocysteine export rates were not increased during nitrous oxide exposure. In the responsive murine fibroblasts and the glioma cells, the homocysteine export rate varied inversely to the changes in methionine synthase activity induced by nitrous oxide exposure at different concentrations of folate in the medium. The enhancement of homocysteine export rate of some cell types during nitrous oxide exposure probably reflects inhibition of homocysteine remethylation in intact cells, and highlights the utility of extracellular homocysteine as an indicator of metabolic flux through the methionine synthase pathway. No enhancement of homocysteine export despite inactivation of methionine synthase in three leukemic cell lines questions the functional state of the enzyme in these cells.","['Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, University of Bergen, Haukeland Hospital, Norway.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The mechanism of cell death remained unclear, however, and was the subject of the experiments reported here. When human U937, HL60, or THP-1 myeloid tumor cell lines or murine CTLL-2 cells were treated with Leu-Leu-OMe, early release of both cytosolic 51Cr and soluble [3H]TdR labeled DNA fragments was observed, whereas antibody + C treatment of these cells caused only 51Cr release. Killing of U937 or THP-1 cells by incubation with the lysosomotropic amino acid methyl ester, Phe-OMe also induced only 51Cr release without evidence of DNA fragmentation. Preincubation with Zn2+, a known inhibitor of endonuclease activity prevented Leu-Leu-OMe-induced 51Cr or [3H]TdR release from these cell lines, but had no effect on antibody + C or Phe-OMe-induced 51Cr release. Zn2+ also prevented Leu-Leu-OMe-mediated killing of normal human CD16+ NK cells. Zn2+ had no inhibitory effect on Leu-Leu-OMe uptake or intracellular conversion to (Leu-Leu)n-OMe metabolites by these cell lines. Moreover, Zn2+ did not inhibit 51Cr release from nonnucleated E or nucleated U937 targets induced by extracellular production of DPPI-generated metabolites of Leu-Leu-OMe. Thus, killing of cytotoxic lymphocytes and myeloid cells by Leu-Leu-OMe appears to be dependent on generation of metabolites with membranolytic properties, but cell death induced by this process does not involve simple lysis of the plasma membrane. Rather, intracellular production of DPPI generated (Leu-Leu)n-OMe metabolites appears to trigger, an additional Zn(2+)-sensitive process that is associated with induction of apoptosis in cells with cytolytic potential.","['Department of Internal Medicine, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas 75235.']",['AI24639/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Intermittent, repeated exposure of normal human marrow mononuclear cells to virus-containing supernatant over a 3-d period of cell maintenance on an IL-3/granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) producing stromal layer resulted in gene transfer efficiencies to LTC-IC of 41%; a level previously obtainable only using co-cultivation infection techniques. Marrow cells enriched greater than or equal to 500-fold for LTC-IC (1-2% pure) by flow cytometry showed gene transfer efficiencies of 27% when infected in a similar fashion over a shorter period (24 h), but in the presence of added soluble IL-3 and G-CSF without stromal feeders, and this increased to 61% when Steel factor was also present during the infection period. By using a less highly enriched population of LTC-IC obtained by a bulk immunoselection technique applicable to large-scale clinical marrow harvests, gene transfer efficiencies to LTC-IC of 40% were achieved and this was increased to 60% by short-term preselection in G418. Southern analysis of DNA from the nonadherent cells produced by these LTC over a 6-wk period provided evidence of clonal evolution of LTC-IC in vitro. Leukemic chronic myelogenous leukemia LTC-IC were also infected at high efficiency using the same supernatant infection strategy with growth factor supplementation. These data demonstrate the feasibility of using cell-free virus preparations for infecting clinical marrow samples suitable for transplantation, as well as for further analysis of human marrow stem cell dynamics in vitro.","['Terry Fox Laboratory, B.

DIA specifically suppresses differentiation of the pluripotential ES cells without compromise of their developmental potential. DIA is identical to the pleiotropic cytokine leukaemia inhibitory factor (LIF) which has a broad range of biological activities in vitro and in vivo. It is produced in both diffusible and matrix-localised forms whose expression is differentially regulated. The compartmentalization of DIA/LIF and the modulation of its expression during stem cell differentiation and by other cytokines may be significant elements in the control of early embryo development. These features may also indicate general principles of the regulatory networks which govern stem cell renewal and differentiation in later development.,"['AFRC Centre for Genome Research, University of Edinburgh, United Kingdom.']",,,,87,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

CD46 cDNA encodes four extracellular short consensus repeat domains, a Ser/Thr/Pro (STP)-rich region, a transmembrane region and a cytoplasmic tail. We now show that exquisite control of mRNA splicing is responsible for the heterogeneous expression of CD46 isoforms. Differential splicing of 5 exons generates at least 14 CD46 mRNA variants whose expression is stringently regulated by allelic, tissue-specific and malignancy-related factors, as: (a) leukemic cells and Epstein-Barr virus-transformed B cells preferentially incorporate the first of three STP exons (exon 7) into mRNA, and produce a larger CD46 isoform of 74 kDa, (b) an allelic difference in the proportion of 66- and 56-kDa CD46 isoforms on lymphocytes corresponds to the preferential inclusion or exclusion of the second STP exon (exon 8), (c) the third STP exon (exon 9) is specifically deleted in some placentae, (d) spermatozoa delete both exons 12 and 13, encoding a shorter transmembrane region and a unique cytoplasmic tail and (e) all tissues tested differentially splice exon 13, resulting in two alternative cytoplasmic tails. The distribution of the 14 alternatively spliced RNA transcripts correlated with the presence of protein isoforms of the predicted size, indicating that alternative splicing leads to heterogeneity of CD46 glycoproteins.","['Austin Research Institute, Austin Hospital, Heidelberg, Victoria, Australia.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Conditioned medium from human epiphyseal chondrocyte cultures (Ch-CM) was tested for IL-6 activity using the B9 cell hybridoma assay. Its NK cell-stimulating capacity in the presence of K562 (myelogenous leukemia) cells or human chondrocytes was evaluated in a 4-hour 51Cr-release assay. Ch-CM-derived IL-6/NK cell-augmenting factor activity was partially purified by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) gel filtration and Western blot. RESULTS: Ch-CM contained an NK cell-augmenting factor (NKAF) which was blocked by IL-2 or IL-6 antibodies. Ch-CM did not contain detectable IL-2 activity, but it stimulated IL-2 production by human peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL). This IL-2-inducing capacity was inhibited by IL-6 antibodies, indicating that chondrocytes release an IL-6-like activity. Ch-CM significantly enhanced the proliferation of IL-6-dependent B9 hybridoma cells, and Western blot analysis of Ch-CM revealed specific bands corresponding to those of highly purified IL-6. Upon HPLC gel filtration, chondrocyte NKAF copurified with chondrocyte IL-6. Pure IL-6 and chondrocyte IL-6 were tested for their ability to stimulate the cytotoxic activity of human PBL against chondrocytes. Both mediators significantly enhanced chondrocyte killing. Lysis of chondrocytes by PBL was mediated by NK cells, since depletion of CD16+ cells resulted in inhibition of the activity. CONCLUSION: Thus, upon stimulation, chondrocytes produce IL-6 which, through IL-2 induction, augments the activity of NK cells against K562 target cells as well as against chondrocytes.","['Department of Histology and Embryology, Warsaw Medical School, Poland.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Somatic mutation at the nucleotide level is 6.03%, and there is a high ratio of replacement to silent mutation in CDRs relative to FWRs. CDR1 mutation is particularly prevalent, and interchanges often lead to acquisition of charge.

The extensive and highly selective somatic mutation of VH251 used in CD5+ CLL cells strongly suggests that part of CLL is generated under the influence of antigen selection and stimulation.","['Department of Microbiology, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas 75235.']",['CA44016/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,['V<down>H</down>251'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, we examined the promoter elements governing constitutive expression of the human ODC gene in HCT 116 human colon carcinoma cells and, for comparison, K562 human erythro-leukemia cells. It was determined by functional analysis that the promoter elements responsible reside within the 378 bp immediately upstream from the transcription start site. Within this sequence, there are at least three regions that modulate the efficiency of the ODC promoter cooperatively. Both DNA bandshift and footprint assays demonstrated all three regions to be rich in sites that bind to nuclear proteins isolated from HCT 116 and K562 cells; the protein binding pattern of non-transformed, diploid fibroblasts was found to be much less complex. Several of the protein binding sequences have little or no homology to common regulatory elements. We suggest that the constitutive activity of the ODC gene in HCT 116 colon carcinoma cells, and perhaps transformed cells in general, involves a complex interaction of multiple regulatory sequences and their associated nuclear proteins. Finally, the saturation of the promoter in these transformed cell lines suggests that high levels of protein binding in the ODC promoter may contribute to elevated constitutive expression of this gene.","['Department of Internal Medicine, Wayne State University School of Medicine, Detroit, MI 48201.']","['CA-50399/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-51206/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,['ODC'],,PMC312396,,['GENBANK/M81740'],,,,,,,,,,,,

Since certain tumor metastases and virus infected cells are targets to natural killer cells (NK cells), we now investigated whether 7T8OG is capable of activating NK cells in mice using NK cell sensitive YAC-1 and B16 and NK cell insensitive P815 targets. CBA/CaJ spleen cells incubated in vitro with 7T8OG at concentrations ranging from 0.005 to 0.5 mM responded with increased NK cell activity (32-62%) compared to controls (4-8%) to YAC-1 targets. Similar levels of augmentation in NK cell activity were observed when 40-168 mg/kg of 7T8OG was administered in vivo. In addition to the spleen, 7T8OG activated NK cells in the bone marrow (BM), the lungs, the liver, and in peritoneal exudate cells (PE). Although 7T8OG elicited activation of NK cells was observed as early as three hours after treatment, the maximal activity was observed after 24 h in the spleen; 12 h in the BM; 48 h in the lungs, and 72 h in PE. Administration of the drug by s.c., i.v., and i.p. routes all induced activation of NK cells in spleen, BM and PE. 7T8OG was found to activate NK cells in seven inbred and an outbred mouse strain, suggesting that the induced cytotoxicity against allogeneic and syngeneic tumor cells is not strain specific as well as independent of MHC restriction. C3H/He, CBA/CaJ and BDF/1 displayed higher levels of increased NK cell activity, whereas AKR mice were low responders.

METHODS: The clinical and haematological features, as well as the morphological characteristics of blast cells, were analysed in nine adults with blast transformation. RESULTS: Most of the patients were male and had enlarged spleens and livers. Five of the patients had normal platelet counts, while all had pronounced anaemia and a moderate degree of leucocytosis. The duration of the acute phase was usually short: 16 (SD 8) weeks. Most myeloid cell lineages--granulocytic, monocytic, and megakaryocytic--were similarly distributed. One patient also had a hybrid (lymphoid-myeloid) phenotype. The morphological assessment of blast cells agreed with immunophenotyping in five out of the nine cases. The onset of the blastic phase was not related to previous treatment. CONCLUSIONS: A pluripotential stem cell with preferential myeloid commitment would be the target cell of blast transformation in idiopathic myelofibrosis. Our immunophenotypic data do not support the concept of a preferential association between megakaryocytic lineage and the acute transformation of idiopathic myelofibrosis. The absence of previous treatment in some cases suggests that this kind of evolution is part of the natural history of idiopathic myelofibrosis.","['Servicio de Hematologia, Hospital Clinico, Salamanca, Spain.']",,,,,,,PMC495307,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have previously shown that the differential expression of globin genes observed in intact K562 cells could be simulated in vitro as K562 nuclear extract (NE) actively transcribes the epsilon-globin (with 2 kilobases of 5'-flanking sequence) and gamma-globin gene DNA templates but not beta-globin gene templates. We have now used the K562 in vitro transcription system to examine a silencer transcriptional control element which has been reported to be localized between -177 and -392 base pairs (bp) 5' of the canonical cap site for the epsilon-globin gene. We find that K562 NE has markedly reduced synthesis of RNA in vitro from epsilon-globin gene DNA deletion templates which contain the silencer sequence, or part thereof, but not the adjacent 5'-positive regulatory region (-453 to -535 bp). Furthermore, those transcripts generated in vitro from DNA templates extending to -453 bp or less of the epsilon-globin gene were not correctly initiated at the canonical cap site. Separating the K562 NE by ion exchange chromatography, we isolated a fraction (F175) transcriptionally active for all tested globin genes including the epsilon-globin gene containing the silencer sequence and a fraction (F50) which contains the trans-acting factors associated with the silencer activity. F50 showed a strong dose-dependent inhibitory effect on correctly initiated epsilon-globin gene transcription directed by either unfractionated K562 NE or F175. This suppression by F50 was not observed on transcriptional activity of the permissive adenovirus 2 major late promoter. In electrophoretic mobility shift assays using the epsilon-globin gene silencer region as probe, F50 and F175 exhibited different DNA binding protein patterns; a specific protein band in F50 appears to be associated with the silencer activity. These studies suggest that this protein may be specifically responsible for the activity of the silencer element of the epsilon-globin gene. The expression and silencing of the epsilon-globin gene during development may be modulated by the interactions of this protein with the cis-acting DNA silencer.","['Laboratory of Chemical Biology, National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland 20892.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have found that the antifolates methotrexate (MTX) and piritrexim (PTX) completely block the de novo purine pathway in mouse L1210 leukemia cells growing in culture but with only minor accumulations of GAR and AICAR to less than 5% of the polyphosphate derivatives of N-formylglycinamide ribotide (FGAR) which accumulate when the pathway is blocked completely by azaserine. This azaserine-induced accumulation of FGAR polyphosphates is completely abolished by MTX, indicating that inhibition of the pathway is at or before GAR transformylase (reaction 3; Lyons, S. D., and Christopherson, R. I. (1991) Biochem. Int. 24, 187-197). Three h after the addition of MTX (0.1 microM), cellular 5-phosphoribosyl-1-pyrophosphate has accumulated 3.4-fold while 6-methyl-mercaptopurine riboside (25 microM) induces a 6.3-fold accumulation. These data suggest that amido phosphoribosyltransferase catalyzing reaction 1 of the pathway is the primary site of inhibition. In support of this conclusion, we have found that dihydrofolate-Glu5, which accumulates in MTX-treated cells, is a noncompetitive inhibitor of amido phosphoribosyltransferase with a dissociation constant of 3.41 +/- 0.08 microM for interaction with the enzyme-glutamine complex in vitro. Folate-Glu5, MTX-Glu5, PTX, dihydrotriazine benzenesulfonyl fluoride, and AICAR also inhibit amido phosphoribosyltransferase.","['Department of Biochemistry, University of Sydney, New South Wales, Australia.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

DBA/2 mice inoculated intraperitoneally (i.p.) with 2 x 10(5) syngeneic leukaemic L1210 cells developed ascites within 8-12 days and died 10-14 days later. Treatment with ProT alpha consistently inhibited the development of ascites in 20% of the treated animals and prolonged the survival of 40%-60% of the animals up to 70 days. The most effective treatment schedule of ProT alpha was 300 ng/mouse given i.p. at 2-day intervals for 3 weeks followed by a rest period of 7 days, prior to tumour cell inoculation. Peritoneal exudate (PE) cells collected from mice treated with the optimal dose of ProT alpha produced, in the absence of exogenous stimulus, six- to eightfold higher levels of tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF alpha) than PE cells from control mice. Furthermore these cells exhibited cytotoxic activity against several tumour cell lines including the syngeneic L1210, the TNF-insensitive P815 mastocytoma, the human MOLT-4 lymphoblastic leukaemia, as well as the murine TNF-sensitive L929 fibroblast cell line. Kinetic studies revealed that both production of TNF alpha and tumoricidal activity peaked 7 days after the last injection of ProT alpha and were maintained at high levels over a period of 1 month. Injections with 150 ng ProT alpha slightly improved the survival of mice whereas higher (500 ng and 1000 ng) doses of ProT alpha and a wide range of thymosin alpha 1 doses remained without any effect. PE cells collected from these mice produced extremely low levels of TNF alpha and exhibited negligible tumoricidal activity. Our data demonstrate that ProT alpha has a protective effect in vivo against the growth of adoptively transferred tumour cells and suggest that this effect is, at least in part, mediated by ProT alpha-activated PE cells. These cells were demonstrated to produce high levels of TNF alpha in vitro and to exhibit activity against both TNF-sensitive and TNF-resistant cell lines.","['Department of Immunology, Hellenic Anticancer Institute, Athens, Greece.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Unlike 1-beta-D-arabinofuranosylcytosine which is activated by deoxycytidine kinase, the enzyme responsible for the phosphorylation of CPE-C is uridine/cytidine kinase. Preclinical pharmacokinetic studies of CPE-C in nonhuman primates revealed that the primary route of elimination in this species was deamination to cyclopentenyluridine (CPE-U), an inhibitor of uridine/cytidine kinase. Since CPE-C is likely to be deaminated in humans, we investigated the modulating effect of CPE-U on the in vitro cytotoxicity of CPE-C in Molt-4 lymphoblasts. Concurrent exposure of cells to cytotoxic concentrations of CPE-C and 50 microM CPE-U resulted in the rescue of 50% of cells and exposure to CPE-U concentrations in excess of 100 microM resulted in the rescue of greater than 90% of cells. Progressive attenuation of the rescue effect was observed with delayed administration of CPE-U and no cells were rescued when addition of CPE-C was delayed for more than 2 h. At the intracellular level it was observed that the formation of the cytotoxic metabolite, cyclopentenylcytosine triphosphate, was blocked by increasing concentrations of CPE-U presumably secondary to inhibition of uridine/cytidine kinase by CPE-U. Although CPE-U can modulate the cytotoxic effects of CPE-C in vitro, the minimum CPE-U levels that are required for modulation coupled with the available preclinical pharmacokinetic data from nonhuman primates suggests that this modulation is not likely to impact on the antitumor effects of CPE-C in humans.","['Walter Reed Army Medical Center, Washington, DC 20307.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Bivariate analysis of p120 and DNA content made it possible to correlate p120 expression with cell position in the cycle. Proliferating lymphocytes and MOLT-4 and HL-60 cells had a similar pattern of p120 expression. Populations of G1 cells, in all three cell types, were very heterogenous with respect to p120, and a threshold in G1 was observed. The cells with a p120 level below the threshold value did not enter S phase. An increase in p120 was observed during progression through S phase, and the antigen was maximally expressed in G2 cells. The p120/DNA content ratio, however, was highest in late G1 cells (G1B) and was declining during S and G2. The data thus suggest that p120 may be degraded during mitosis and that the postmitotic cells inherit little, if any, of this protein; the antigen then accumulates predominantly during G1, and must reach a threshold level to enable the cells to enter S phase. Antigen p120 could not be detected in noncycling lymphocytes nor in HL-60 cells induced to myeloid differentiation by growth in the presence of dimethyl sulfoxide. Treatment of MOLT-4 cells with pharmacological concentrations of methotrexate, camptothecin, or teniposide induced cell arrest in S or G2; expression of p120 in the arrested cells was unchanged from that of untreated MOLT-4 controls at the same phase of the cycle. The level of p120 was minimal in MOLT-4 or HL-60 cells arrested in M phase by vinblastine, but vinblastine had no effect on p120 fluorescence of interphase cells. Camptothecin or teniposide induced apoptosis selectively in S phase of HL-60 cells; apoptotic cells from camptothecin-treated cultures, however, despite the marked nucleolysis, still expressed p120. The data on the drug-treated cells indicate that the p120 level in tumors of patients may be used as a marker of tumor/malignancy even in clinical samples obtained during treatment.","['Cancer Research Institute, New York Medical College, Valhalla 10595.']","['CA23296/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA28704/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This agent induces repairable protein-bridged double-strand DNA breaks, which have been correlated with cytotoxicity, but high concentrations of VM-26 also induce irreversible DNA degradation and apoptotic cell death. It is not known whether this degradation occurs uniformly throughout the genome or in a gene-specific manner. To answer this question, DNA was isolated from HL-60 promyelocytic leukemia cells exposed to 5 microM VM-26 for varying periods of up to 12 h. Nucleosomal ""ladders"" on 2.0% agarose gels stained with ethidium bromide were detectable after 3 h of exposure, indicative of apoptosis.

The proto-oncogenes c-myc, c-Ha-ras, and bcl-2 were examined as examples of other transcriptionally active genes, while transcriptionally inactive genes in HL-60 cells were studied by probing for the immunoglobulin heavy chain joining region and lambda light chain constant region genes. The rates of DNA degradation, and its extent after 12 h, were similar for all nuclear genes studied. However, there was striking resistance of mitochondrial DNA to endonucleolytic degradation.

This protein decreases upon cell stimulation, as both MAT activity and the amount of the catalytic alpha/alpha' subunits of the enzyme increase. When resting cells are activated by phytohemagglutinin, the decrease in lambda and increase in alpha/alpha' occurs after interleukin 2 (IL-2) production and before DNA synthesis. The human T-leukemia cell line, Jurkat, is unique in its ability to produce IL-2 in response to exogenous stimuli such as T-cell mitogens and therefore provides a convenient model for studying biochemical reactions involved in T-cell activation. In this study the regulation of MAT activity and S-adenosylmethionine (AdoMet) in resting and activated Jurkat cells was investigated. Here we report that MAT activity in unstimulated Jurkat cells is about 10- and 3-fold higher than the activity in resting and activated peripheral blood mononuclear cells, respectively. Activation of Jurkat cells with phytohemagglutinin resulted in increased IL-2-production, but not an increase in MAT activity. Identical results were obtained using freshly isolated cells from acute lymphoblastic leukemia patients. AdoMet utilization and pool size were approximately 3- and 10-fold higher, respectively, in Jurkat cells compared to peripheral blood mononuclear cells, and both parameters were unaffected by phytohemagglutinin stimulation. Jurkat MAT was determined to be structurally indistinguishable from enzyme from T- or B-leukemia cells but was different from resting, normal T-cells in that it lacked the lambda form. Furthermore, unlike MAT in resting T-cells, the relative amounts of the alpha, alpha', and beta subunits of the enzyme did not change throughout the course of IL-2 induction. We conclude that AdoMet metabolism and MAT activity in Jurkat cells are constitutively high and that induction of IL-2 synthesis in these cells is independent of changes in AdoMet synthesis or turnover.

Analysis of nuclear proteins that bind to oligonucleotides containing the consensus sequences of the transcription factors activation protein 1, nuclear factor (NF) kappa B, and NFAT 1 revealed a pattern for HD lines resembling that of activated T-cells: HDLM-2 and KM-H2 cells constitutively expressed NF binding to the NF of activated T-cells (type 1), previously described to be T-cell specific. In addition, NF kappa B-binding proteins obtained from both lines showed, in electrophoretic mobility shift assays, the same migration pattern as T-cell-derived proteins but differed from monocyte- and B-cell-derived proteins. UV cross-linking experiments confirmed that NF kappa B-binding proteins of M(r) 85,000, 75,000, and 50,000/55,000 were detectable in nuclear extracts obtained from T-cells and both HD lines, while monocytes and B-cells displayed the M(r) 50,000/55,000 and 75,000 NF kappa B complex only.

A polyclonal rabbit antibody to human placental GST pi coupled with peroxidase antiperoxidase staining was used for immunodetection of GST pi on sections of routinely fixed bone marrow clots. All patients had received induction therapy based on an anthracycline and a standard dose of ara-C. The expression of GST pi at diagnosis was significantly correlated with response to induction therapy, duration of first remission, and overall survival. Twenty-nine of 36 samples of bone marrow from patients that entered complete remission (CR) following primary induction therapy showed a low expression, whereas nine of 16 sections from patients with resistant disease showed a high expression of GST pi (P less than or equal to 0.03). Of 40 sections that showed a low expression of GST pi, 29 (73%) were taken from patients that achieved a CR, whereas 12 of 19 sections that showed a high expression of the enzyme were from patients with resistant disease or that entered CR only after additional therapy (P less than or equal to 0.02). The median duration of first CR was 18.2 mo for patients whose cells showed a low expression of GST pi compared with 6.7 mo for those that entered CR in spite of a high expression of the enzyme (P less than or equal to 0.005). Of cells from ten patients that at the time of study were in a continuous first CR, none expressed high concentrations of GST pi. The expression of GST pi remained rather constant in most patients as the disease progressed to clinical resistance. At relapse there was no significant correlation between the expression of GST pi and treatment results but, of ten patients that entered a second CR or achieved a partial remission, only one showed a high expression of the enzyme. We conclude that there was a significant correlation between the expression of GST pi at the time of diagnosis and the subsequent treatment results and that GST pi is a useful marker for clinical resistance to cytostatic drugs in acute nonlymphoblastic leukemia.","['Department of Medicine, Huddinge Hospital, Sweden.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

CNDAC extended the life span of mice bearing P388 leukemia. CNDAC had a unique in vitro antitumor spectrum for human cancers different from that of ara-C. Compared with ara-C, CNDAC was more effective in 10 human tumors (2 lung, 4 stomach and 4 osteosarcoma), equal in 2 tumors (lung and fibrosarcoma) and less potent in 11 tumors (4 lung, 4 osteosarcoma, bladder, renal and epidermoid). Characteristically CNDAC showed excellent activities against tumors, refractory to ara-C, such as HT-1080 human fibrosarcoma implanted in chick embryos or athymic mice, although its cytotoxicity against HT-1080 was almost equal to that of ara-C. Thus, CNDAC is an interesting and promising agent that should be considered for further detailed preclinical evaluation.","['Department of Experimental Therapeutics, Kanazawa University, Japan.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Procarbazine is converted initially to azoprocarbazine, which is then N-oxidized through a cytochrome P-450-mediated process to a mixture of the positional isomers, benzylazoxyprocarbazine and methylazoxyprocarbazine. In order to define the bioactivation events that lead to the cytotoxic species, the in vitro cytotoxicities of the purified azoxy isomers as well as of the parent compound, procarbazine, were evaluated with the human leukemia cell line, CCRF-CEM. The methylazoxy isomer was found to be the most active species. Procarbazine inhibited the growth of CCRF-CEM cells but at a concentration much higher than that required for the methylazoxy isomer. Since procarbazine must be metabolized to form the cytotoxic species, we sought to determine if the active metabolite, methylazoxyprocarbazine, was being formed in the incubations. Solutions of procarbazine incubated with and without cells at 37 degrees C were analyzed by combined liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry with a thermospray interface. The azoxy metabolites of procarbazine appeared rapidly in cellular incubations and in the aqueous solutions without cells. More of the methylazoxy isomer was formed initially, but by 72 hr the benzylazoxy isomer was the predominant species. Thus, in these studies it appears that procarbazine was benzylazoxy isomer was the predominant species. Thus, in these studies it appears that procarbazine was non-enzymatically oxidized to the two azoxyprocarbazine isomers and that the methylazoxy compound was the most cytotoxic to CCRF-CEM cells.","['Department of Pharmacology, University of Utah, Salt Lake City 84112.']","['GM29812/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'HL02119/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Because we also showed that TNF-alpha and IL-1 beta can act synergistically to cause monocytoid differentiation of HL-60 cells, we hypothesized that acivicin-induced TNF-alpha and IL-1 beta, in an autocrine manner, caused the differentiation. The purpose of the present study was to determine the causal roles of TNF-alpha and IL-1 beta in the acivicin-induced differentiation of HL-60 cells by the use of dexamethasone (DEX) and pentoxifylline (PTX), two drugs that effectively inhibit expression of TNF-alpha and IL-1 beta. Acivicin caused a monocytoid differentiation of the cells as manifest by diminished cell growth, morphologic maturation of the cells, increased ability to generate hydrogen peroxide in response to acute treatment with phorbol myristate acetate, and increased expression of nonspecific esterase and the surface antigens CD14 and CD11b. Acivicin treatment also caused the cells to have diminished steady-state expression of messenger RNA (mRNA) for c-myc and c-myb, and increased expression of mRNA for TNF-alpha and IL-1 beta. DEX and PTX did not alter cell growth, and did not block the acivicin-induced block in growth. PTX caused a slight increase in nonspecific esterase expression, but DEX had no effect on this, and neither drug diminished the acivicin-induced increase in nonspecific esterase. Although neither drug alone lessened the acivicin enhancement of hydrogen peroxide production, DEX and PTX together reduced this. DEX did not modify the acivicin-induced morphologic maturation of the cells, but PTX alone or PTX with DEX potentiated the acivicin-induced increase in mature cells. Basal CD14 and CD11b expression were slightly reduced by DEX and PTX, but neither drug modified the acivicin-induced increases. DEX and PTX reduced the acivicin-induced increases in TNF-alpha and IL-1 beta mRNA expression, but they had little or no effect on the acivicin-induced decreases in expression of mRNA for c-myc and c-myb. Thus, DEX and PTX effectively block the acivicin-induced expression of TNF-alpha and IL-1 beta, but they have little influence on the acivicin-induced differentiation process.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","['VA Center, Department of Medicine, Durham, NC 27705.']","['P01 32682/PHS HHS/United States', 'P50AR39162/AR/NIAMS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,"['c-myb', 'c-myc']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This karyotype anomaly occurred in leukemia cells from five of 445 (1.1%) children with newly diagnosed ANLL who were successfully studied by cytogenetic analysis at four European centers between January 1987 and January 1992. The occurrence of the t(1;22) was restricted to the French-American-British classification (FAB) subtype M7. The overall incidence in children with acute megakaryocytic leukemia (AMKL) was 27.8% (5/18 cases); in infants with AMKL, the frequency of the t(1;22) was 66.7% (4/6 cases). Three of the patients carrying this anomaly had a diploid karyotype, whereas in two cases a hyperdiploid karyotype was found. However, in all five patients, the t(1;22) was the only translocation event present at diagnosis. All patients received aggressive chemotherapy for acute myelogenous leukemia (AML). Two patients died within 15 months of diagnosis without entering remission. One of three patients who entered remission died 7 months after diagnosis, most likely from intramedullar hemorrhage. Only two of the five children with the t(1;22) who received autologous bone marrow transplantation (BMT) are alive and in complete remission (CR) 23 and 40 months after diagnosis, respectively. At the time of diagnosis, the age of the oldest child carrying the t(1;22) was 18 months. The cases with this chromosome anomaly were compared with an age-matched group of five children with AMKL lacking this translocation. The patients with the t(1;22) had a lower median value of the peripheral white blood cell (WBC) count and a higher median hemoglobin level than the patients from the matched group. In the latter cases, normocellular or hypercellular bone marrow (BM) was detected at diagnosis. In contrast, all children with the t(1;22) in our series had a hypocellular BM. Histological BM analyses were available in three of these patients and showed marked fibrosis. Other clinical and laboratory parameters showed no obvious differences between the matched groups. Despite intensive chemotherapy, AMKL in children appears to be associated with a poor prognosis. The clinical courses of the children with AMKL and the t(1;22) presented may be indicative of a beneficial effect of autologous BMT in this subset of patients.","[""CCRI, St. Anna Children's Hospital, Wien, Austria.""]",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Trisomies of several individual chromosomes were associated with a better prognosis in a univariate statistical analysis. Of greater importance, trisomy of both chromosomes 4 and 10 identified a subgroup of patients (n = 180) with an extremely favorable 4-year event-free survival (EFS). Combined trisomy of chromosomes 4 and 10 retained its prognostic significance after stratification of patients by DNA index, age, and leukocyte count. Among patients with a DNA index greater than 1.16, patients with trisomies of both chromosomes 4 and 10 had a 4-year EFS of 96.6% (n = 161, SE = 3.8%), whereas patients with neither or only one of these trisomies had a 4-year EFS of 70.4% (n = 73, SE = 11.5%). All 19 patients with a DNA index less than or equal to 1.16 but with trisomies of chromosomes 4 and 10 remain in remission, suggesting that favorable chromosome trisomy dominates in a situation in which the cellular DNA content of less than or equal to 1.16 predicts a less favorable outcome. We conclude that combined trisomy of chromosomes 4 and 10 independently predicts EFS among children with B-progenitor ALL. Patients within the B-progenitor group who have this feature (about 20% of those with clonal abnormalities) are likely to be cured with antimetabolite-based chemotherapy--an approach that should produce few significant late effects.","[""Tomorrows Children's Institute, Hackensack Medical Center, NJ.""]","['CA25408/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA29139/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA31566/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The compound is shown here to be a mixed non-competitive inhibitor of TS from murine leukemia (L1210) cells when 5,10-CH2FH4 is varied. This result suggests formation of an inactive complex between TS, 5,10-CH2FH4 and the inhibitor. Thus, binding to only one of the two active sites on the TS homodimer may be sufficient to prevent catalysis fully. Treatment of L1210 cells with ICI D1694 is known to cause intracellular accumulation of the tetraglutamate derivative which is shown here to have a 60-fold higher affinity for TS. The IC50 for inhibition of L1210 cell growth is below the Ki value of ICI D1694 for L1210 TS but above that of the tetraglutamate. The formation of polyglutamates and concentration of drug inside cells, therefore, seem to be responsible for biological activity.","['ICI Pharmaceuticals Mereside, Macclesfield Cheshire, U.K.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This group, traditionally identified using immunologic smear techniques, has been associated with a poor prognosis in some series. In a comparative study, 25 cases of B-lineage acute lymphoblastic leukemia were analyzed for C mu expression using molecular and immunologic techniques. RNA derived from cryopreserved blast cells was hybridized in both Northern and slot-blot analyses using a probe (pBZ311) containing four exons of the human immunoglobulin heavy chain mu constant region gene. Expression of C mu proteins was assessed simultaneously by slide immunofluorescence and flow cytometric techniques in all samples. These studies were correlated with immunoglobulin heavy and light chain gene rearrangements, cell-surface immunophenotype, cytogenetics, and other clinicopathologic features. C mu mRNA transcripts were detected in 14 of 25 cases, whereas C mu proteins were detected in only 9 of these cases using flow cytometric techniques. Only four of these nine cases were positive by slide immunofluorescence techniques. These studies imply that molecular and flow cytometric techniques may be a more sensitive means to assess C mu expression. The identification of five cases that expressed C mu mRNA transcripts in the absence of detectable C mu proteins also suggests that molecular techniques may be valuable in identifying a unique subgroup of pre-B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia cases that contain C mu mRNA transcripts, but lack C mu proteins.","['Department of Pathology, University of New Mexico School of Medicine, Albuquerque.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Nine cases of precursor B-cell ALL were positive for CD19 and/or CD22. Five CD19 + cases of ALL reacted with anti-myeloperoxidase, with one case also positive for CD15. CD15 positivity was confirmed on repeated study as well as with plastic section immunoperoxidase staining.

Although paraffin section immunophenotyping in general, and this panel in particular, have been shown to be very reliable in defining B-cell lineage, characterization of T-cell lineage is less definitive. This is related primarily to the relatively poor specificity of the commercially available T-cell-associated reagents. CD43 (Leu22) in particular has a broad immunoreactivity profile that has not been stressed adequately in some reports. Seventeen cases with a ""CD43 only"" phenotype were identified during the last several years while using the relatively standard screening panel mentioned above. These cases were quite heterogeneous with respect to cellular differentiation and most were not T-cell proliferations. Specifically, eight cases were extramedullary leukemic infiltrates (five myeloid, two monocytic, one mixed lineage), four cases were T-cell lymphomas, three cases were B-cell lymphomas and two cases were plasmacytomas. Although CD43 has demonstrable utility in a leukocyte screening panel, this report stresses the aberrancy and lack of specificity of the ""CD43 only"" phenotype. Caution is recommended in assigning a specific lineage to such cellular proliferations without additional immunologic or genotypic analysis. Recommendations for comprehensive diagnostic evaluation of these proliferations are provided.","['Department of Pathology, Cleveland Clinic Foundation, Ohio 44195.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The effects of T3 on protein phosphorylation and growth rate of L1210 cells were investigated in a medium containing T3-depleted fetal calf serum. T3 was observed to be effective in enhancing protein phosphorylation (153.06% +/- 5.99 SD) compared to cells grown in the absence of T3 (81.49% +/- 13.50 SD). Moreover, in the presence of high T3 concentration (11.15 nmol/l) T3 was found to significantly increase the cell growth rate. In addition, the T3 receptor-associated alterations during the cell cycle, as measured by flow cytometry, suggest that the presence of T3 receptors becomes evident during the late G1 phase of the cell cycle, and T3 receptor numbers increase during the S phase. These results suggest that in in vitro conditions representing high T3 concentration, the number of L1210 leukemia cells may be increased by T3 via nuclear receptors. The L1210 leukemia cell line may serve as a convenient tool for in vitro studies of nuclear receptors and/or mechanism of action of T3.

A recently described mediator is urocanic acid, which is transformed by UV light in the skin from the trans- to the cis-isomer and that exerts a systemic immunomodulatory effect. In our experiments, treatment with PUVA or with cis-urocanic acid prevents the rejection of rat heart allografts in 50% and 40% of cases, respectively. Control grafts are rejected in fewer than 10 days. PUVA treatment of donor leukocytes before transfusion into the prospective recipient inhibits only their sensitizing, not their graft-protecting, effect on subsequent skin grafts in mice. PUVA treatment also prevents acute lethal GVH disease in mice after irradiation with a sublethal dose of x-rays and transfusion of semiallogeneic spleen cells. Treatment of recipient mice with cis-urocanic acid has the same effect. The humoral immune response to sheep erythrocytes is not influenced by cis-urocanic acid. These results demonstrate that PUVA treatment or its chemical mediator, cis-urocanic acid, may be used in transplantation and hematology as naturally occurring immunosuppressive agents, especially for the control and manipulation of GVH leukemia reaction.","['Department of Dermatology, Faculty of Medicine (Charite), Humboldt University, Berlin, Germany.']",,,,28,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The majority of the p56lck in these cell lines is translated from a hybrid mRNA comprised of the 5' untranslated region of the murine leukemia virus env mRNA and lck coding sequences. The retroviral promoter giving rise to this transcript has been molecularly cloned. To examine whether overexpression of unmutated p56lck might induce cellular transformation, we constructed a plasmid in which the murine leukemia virus promoter from LSTRA cells directed the expression of p56lck. This construct gave rise to foci when transfected into rat 208F fibroblasts. Cells from many of the foci also grew in soft agar. Tryptic peptide mapping showed that the p56lck in the transformed cells was phosphorylated at Tyr-394, the autophosphorylation site, but not detectably at Tyr-505, an inhibitory site. Because an antiserum made to the carboxy terminus of p56lck could not immunoprecipitate p56lck from these transformed cells, the possibility arose that the proteins expressed in the transformed fibroblasts contained mutations that altered the carboxy terminus of the protein. cDNAs derived from the 3' ends of the lck mRNAs in two of the foci were cloned, and both were found to be derived from an lck gene that was truncated upstream of the codon for Tyr-505 and fused to random sequences derived from other parts of the construct used for transfection. lck therefore resembles several other src family members in that it can be rendered oncogenic by replacement of the region encoding the inhibitory, carboxy-terminal phosphorylation site by random amino acid sequences.","['Molecular Biology and Virology Laboratory, Salk Institute, San Diego, California 92186.']","['CA14195/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA42350/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

RNAase protection experiments revealed that the different PML isoforms are equally expressed in established cell lines of different histological origin.","['Istituto Clinica Medica I, University of Perugia, Italy.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In studies on the kinase that phosphorylates the RB proteins, we have previously found that RB proteins can be phosphorylated by purified cdc2 kinase. In this study, we noted that RB proteins immunoprecipitated from human cell lysates are weakly phosphorylated in the absence of purified cdc2 kinase. Immunoblot analysis showed the presence of p34cdc2 in the immunoprecipitates with anti-RB monoclonal antibody. In addition, the coprecipitated kinase was found to have the same substrate specificity as cdc2 kinase. The associated kinase activity was particularly high in cells arrested in G1/S and S phase by aphidicolin. Furthermore, RB proteins were shown to be phosphorylated in nuclear extracts by some endogenous cdc2-like kinase(s).

Moreover, the relation between the risk of leukemia and the amount of drug given and the interaction of chemotherapy with radiotherapy have not been described in detail. METHODS: We conducted a case-control study in a cohort of 82,700 women given a diagnosis of breast cancer from 1973 to 1985 in five areas of the United States. Detailed information about therapy was obtained for 90 patients with leukemia and 264 matched controls. The dose of radiation to the active marrow was estimated from individual radiotherapy records (mean dose, 7.5 Gy). RESULTS: The risk of acute nonlymphocytic leukemia was significantly increased after regional radiotherapy alone (relative risk, 2.4), alkylating agents alone (relative risk, 10.0), and combined radiation and drug therapy (relative risk, 17.4). Dose-dependent risks were observed after radiotherapy and treatment with melphalan and cyclophosphamide. Melphalan was 10 times more leukemogenic than cyclophosphamide (relative risk, 31.4 vs. 3.1). There was little increase in the risk associated with total cyclophosphamide doses of less than 20,000 mg. CONCLUSIONS: Although leukemia occurs in few patients with breast cancer, significantly elevated risks were linked to treatments with regional radiation and alkylating agents. Melphalan is a more potent leukemogen than cyclophosphamide or radiotherapy. Low risks were associated with the levels of cyclophosphamide in common use today. Systemic drug therapy combined with radiotherapy that delivers high doses to the marrow appears to enhance the risk of leukemia.","['Radiation Epidemiology Branch, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, Md. 20892.']",,['N Engl J Med. 1992 Jun 25;326(26):1774-5.

The human homologue of the murine leukemia oncogene evi-1 was recently localized to chromosome 3q24-3q28 and transcription of evi-1 is a frequent event in mouse-retrovirus-induced leukemias (17). To determine whether translocations near human 3q24 might induce similar genetic changes, we examined and compared evi-1 and c-myc expression and regulation in UCSD/AML1 cells. Steady-state evi-1 transcripts were detected in UCSD/AML1 and murine leukemia M1 cells, but were not present in HL60 or Namalwa human leukemia cells. Transcription assays showed the evi-1 gene was actively transcribed in UCSD/AML1, but not HL60 nuclei. Evi-1 transcript sizes and half-life were similar in UCSD/AML1 and human HEC-1B carcinoma cells which express evi-1 transcripts, but do not have abnormalities involving chromosome 3. An alternative splice site detected by polymerase chain reaction was present in transcripts from both cell lines. Regulation of evi-1 RNA in UCSD/AML1 cells was similar to that of actin transcripts in response to cycloheximide or phorbol-ester-induced macrophage differentiation. After withdrawal of granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), evi-1, actin, and histone H3 transcripts declined in concert with exit from the cell cycle. Minor differences in rates of recovery were noted for these three genes after GM-CSF restimulation. In contrast, c-myc was expressed at high levels in UCSD/AML1 cells and showed evidence for specific regulation in response to cycloheximide, phorbol ester, and GM-CSF withdrawal and restimulation. These studies suggest the 3q translocation in UCSD/AML1 cells is associated with evi-1 transcription and expression of a potential transforming gene. In contrast to c-myc, evi-1 expression is minimally altered by biologically active chemicals or growth factor stimulation.","['Department of Medicine, VA Medical Center, Sepulveda, California.']",['CA32094/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,['evi-1'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The effects of drug combinations at doses giving 80% inhibition (ID80) were analyzed by an improved isobologram method. A supra-additive (synergistic) effect was observed for mitoxantrone in combination with amsacrine, cisplatin, or cytosine arabinoside. An additive effect was observed for its combination with bleomycin, doxorubicin, etoposide, 5-fluorouracil, mitomycin C, 6-mercaptopurine, or vincristine. A sub-additive (antagonistic) effect was observed for its combination with methotrexate.

Incubation of blasts with 1 microM ara-C and 12.5 nM bryostatin 1(+/- 1.25 ng/ml rGM-CSF) resulted in a heterogeneous pattern of inhibitory effects toward primary leukemic colonies, ranging from 32-98%, and subadditive to synergistic drug interactions. However, exposure of blasts to ara-C and bryostatin 1, either with or without rGM-CSF, eliminated leukemic cell self-renewal in 80-93% of samples, and very substantially reduced growth in the remainder. Exposure of normal human bone marrow mononuclear cells to identical concentrations of ara-C and byostatin 1 permitted the survival of 23% of committed myeloid progenitors (granulocyte-macrophage colony-forming units), and greater than 50% when rGM-CSF was included. Finally, exposure of bone marrow populations highly enriched for progenitor cells (CD34+, DR-, CD71-) to ara-C and bryostatin 1 +/- rGM-CSF for 24 h led to minimal reductions (e.g. 10-15%) in the survival of early hematopoietic progenitors (high proliferative potential colony-forming cells). Together, these findings indicate that combined exposure in vitro to ara-C and bryostatin 1, both with and without rGM-CSF, effectively inhibits the growth of leukemic cells with self-renewal capacity, while sparing a significant fraction of normal committed and primitive hematopoietic progenitors.","['Division of Hematology/Oncology, Medical College of Virginia, Richmond 23298.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Injection of IL-6 and IL-1 alpha induced in vivo differentiation of leukemic cells that were induced to differentiate by these cytokines in vitro, but not of leukemic cells that were not susceptible to these cytokines in vitro. In contrast, injection of GM-CSF induced in vivo differentiation both in leukemic cells that were susceptible or not susceptible to GM-CSF in vitro. The effect of GM-CSF, but not of IL-6 or IL-1 alpha, on inducing differentiation in vivo was inhibited by pretreatment with hydrocortisone. In leukemic cells that were not induced to differentiate with GM-CSF in vitro, this inhibition of differentiation by pretreatment with hydrocortisone was greater than inhibition of differentiation obtained by pretreatment with cyclophosphamide or irradiation or the use of nude mice. After hydrocortisone pretreatment, the number of peritoneal cells and their ability to produce GM-CSF and IL-6 were suppressed. It is suggested that hydrocortisone can inhibit the effect of an injected cytokine such as GM-CSF on induction of in vivo differentiation of leukemic cells by inhibiting the ability of host cells to produce cytokines to which the leukemic cells are susceptible.","['Department of Molecular Genetics and Virology, Weizmann Institute of Science, Rehovot, Israel.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The extent to which DNA methylation contributes to the differentiation of hematopoietic cells is elusive. In the present study we investigated the methylation state of the c-fms/M-CSF receptor gene in normal human blood cells and tissue macrophages. The methylation pattern of the c-fms gene as detected by isoschizomeric restriction analysis with MspI/HpaII showed only slight interindividual variations in normal donors, whereas constant differences were found between granulocytes and monocytes from the same donor. The second intron of the c-fms gene contains several CpG loci which were found to be hypomethylated on both alleles in monocytes and tissue macrophages. By contrast, these positions were methylated in granulocytes and lymphocytes that did not express the c-fms gene. In comparison to monocytes alveolar and peritoneal macrophages revealed an enhanced demethylation. There were constant differences in c-fms gene methylation between alveolar and peritoneal macrophages with a higher degree of demethylation in alveolar macrophages. We conclude that c-fms gene demethylation is involved in the differentiation of monocytes and macrophages from immature precursors and that the demethylation of lineage-specific growth factor receptor genes might provide an important step in lineage commitment of hematopoietic cells.","['Institute of Pathology, Kiel, Germany.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although the transmission routes of HTLV-I are known, these seroepidemiologic features cannot be fully explained. PURPOSE: This study was designed to identify potential characteristics associated with HTLV-I infection in a highly endemic Japanese community. METHODS: We evaluated occupational, residential, dietary, and medical histories in a case-control study conducted in two neighboring villages in southeastern Miyazaki Prefecture. One hundred forty-four case subjects and 276 control subjects, frequency matched by age, sex, and village, were interviewed. Village-specific profiles of demographic determinants of HTLV-I seroprevalence were generated using multiple logistic regression. RESULTS: Although a different pattern of factors was found for each village, occupations of the subjects and their fathers were associated with HTLV-I infection in both communities--farming in village A and fishing and farming in village B. For village A, there was more than a twofold association both with residence in the township for 55 years or more and with living in a particular area within the village. In addition, case subjects were more likely to have a mother who was deceased (odds ratio = 1.7; 95% confidence interval = 0.96-2.9). CONCLUSIONS: HTLV-I infection is characterized by a high degree of microepidemicity in this population, with seroprevalence related to both sociologic and geographic determinants.

The patients received fluconazole, 2, 4, or 8 mg/kg per day for 7 days intravenously for a 2-hour period. Patients had no nausea or vomiting related to fluconazole; three patients had an asymptomatic rise in hepatic aminotransferase values after four to six doses (one patient at 2 mg/kg per day and two patients at 8 mg/kg per day), which returned to normal within 2 weeks after discontinuation of the drug. Fluconazole showed linear first-order kinetics over the dosage range tested and during multiple dosing. After the first dose, mean clearance was 22.8 +/- 2.3 ml/min, volume of distribution 0.87 +/- 0.06 L/kg, and terminal elimination half-life 16.8 +/- 1.1 hours. Similarly, after the last dose, clearance was 19.4 +/- 1.3 ml/min, volume of distribution 0.84 +/- 0.04 L/kg, and terminal elimination half-life 18.1 +/- 1.2 hours. Patients receiving their first fluconazole dose of 8 mg/kg achieved peak serum levels of 9.5 +/- 0.4 microgram/ml and trough levels of 2.7 +/- 0.5 microgram/ml 24 hours later, and an area under the serum concentration-time curve from time zero to infinity of 186 +/- 16 micrograms.hr per milliliter. Renal clearance of fluconazole was 65% +/- 5% of total clearance and demonstrated the predominantly renal excretion of this drug.

Recent studies have shown that pentoxifylline can modulate a number of neutrophil functions at in vitro concentrations of at least 50 micrograms/ml. Using a standard51chromium-release assay, we studied the suppressive effects of pentoxifylline on natural killer (NK) cell activity and found that pentoxifylline, at concentrations of 50 and 100 micrograms/ml, suppressed the in vitro NK cell activity of healthy volunteers by 25% and 75%, respectively. Postreaction supernatants from chromium-release studies were then assayed for prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) by using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Concentrations of both PGE2 and TNF-alpha were increased by more than five times in those assay wells containing pentoxifylline. Moreover, the addition of 1 microgram/ml indomethacin to the NK assay system containing pentoxifylline, completely inhibited PGE2 production and abrogated the pentoxifylline-induced NK suppression. The addition of PGE2 (1 x 10(-6) mol/L) to the assay system suppressed NK activity, whereas addition of 1 or 10 ng/ml TNF-alpha did not. Theophylline, another methylxanthine, failed to suppress NK activity like pentoxifylline at equimolar concentrations. Our studies provide the first evidence that concentrations of pentoxifylline of at least 50 micrograms/ml suppressed NK cell function by inducing PGE2 synthesis from effector peripheral-blood mononuclear cells.","['Department of Radiology, College of Medicine, University of Iowa, Iowa City.']","['5T32-CA09125/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'RR59/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Immunoglobulins generally showed heavy background staining, which frequently precluded an accurate assessment. The CD4 to CD8 ratio in the bone marrow was reversed from that of peripheral blood. On fixed tissues, leukocyte common antigen was found in 14% of the marrow cells, corresponding roughly to the lymphocyte population. L26, a pan-B-cell marker, stained 3% of the marrow cells. Among the other B-cell markers, LN1 and MB2 stained a large number of cells (40% to 70%), indicating reactivity with cells of the myeloid or erythroid series in addition to lymphocytes. Among the T-cell markers, UCHL1 and MT1 stained 66% and 50% of the cells, respectively, which could be explained by their cross-reactivity with myeloid cells. Nonspecific myelomonocytic markers (Leu-M1, KP1, and lysozyme) also showed reactivity in a high percentage of cells.

These cells do not contain detectable levels of P-glycoprotein. At the present time the mechanism by which HL60/Adr cells reduce drug levels is not known. To gain insight into the molecular basis of this system we have analyzed transport pathways and the distribution of daunomycin in drug-resistant HL60 cells. Using a cell fractionation technique we find that the major portion of daunomycin accumulates in the nucleus of both sensitive and resistant cells. Further studies reveal, however, that under efflux conditions drug is retained in the nuclei of sensitive cells but rapidly removed from the nuclei of the resistant isolate. Essentially identical results are obtained when daunomycin distribution and transport are analyzed by fluorescence microscopy. A number of agents which alter transport processes have been tested for their effect on drug accumulation in resistant cells. Thus we find that brefeldin A, which disassembles Golgi, and various lysosomotropic agents such as chloroquine and methylamine do not affect drug levels. In contrast the protonophores nigericin and monensin induce an increase in drug accumulation and inhibit efflux. The results of this study thus suggest that resistance in HL60/Adr cells is related to a mechanism whereby drug is transported to the nucleus and thereafter rapidly redistributed to the extracellular space. The molecular basis of this transport pathway is not known.","['Division of Biology, Kansas State University, Manhattan, Kansas 66506-4901.']",['CA37585/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In contrast, T-cell ALLs introduce a potpourri of genes into their T cell receptor loci. However, a common theme is emerging. These oncogenes (Ttg1, Ttg2, SCL, LylI, H0X11) all belong to classic families of transcription factors, possessing LIM domains, helix-loop-helix motifs, or homeodomains.

However, effective therapy using unmodified murine monoclonal antibodies was elusive because these antibodies are immunogenic and elicit a human immune response, are not cytocidal against human cells, and in most cases are not directed against a cell surface structure required for proliferation and survival. Recently therapy mediated by monoclonal antibodies has been revolutionized by the definition of cell surface structures as targets for effective monoclonal antibody action, the creation by genetic engineering of less immunogenic and more effective monoclonal antibodies, and by the arming of such antibodies with toxins and radionuclides. Furthermore, other therapeutic agents directed toward immune receptors have been developed, including cytokine-toxin fusion proteins as alternative vehicles to address abnormal receptor-expressing cells, soluble immune receptors and naturally occurring receptor antagonists as immunomodulators, and T cell antigen receptor peptides as immunogens to provide protection against autoimmune diseases.

Doses of this drug which resulted in a rapid clearance of parasites from T. b. brucei-infected rats resulted in plasma levels of 50-60 microM-MDL 73811 and an intratrypanosomal MDL 73811 concentration of 1.9 mM within 10 min of administration [Byers, Bush, McCann & Bitonti (1991) Biochem. J. 274, 527-533[. Based on this finding we speculated that MDL 73811, which is an adenosine analogue, is a substrate for the trypanosome active purine transport system. We now report evidence that supports this hypothesis. MDL 73811 uptake by T. b. brucei in vitro was time- and temperature-dependent and was saturable over a time course in which MDL 73811 metabolism was undetectable, suggesting that MDL 73811 uptake is a transport-mediated phenomenon. Inhibition of MDL 73811 uptake by purine nucleosides is consistent with the drug being a substrate for the trypanosome purine transport system. The accumulation of MDL 73811 by cultured L1210 mouse leukaemia cells was significantly less than by trypanosomes exposed to the same pharmacologically relevant concentrations of MDL 73811. Given that the half-life of MDL 73811 in the plasma of rats and mice is approx. 10 min, it seems likely that the existence of a highly active parasite transport system for MDL 73811 is crucial for the sensitivity of trypanosomes towards MDL 73811 in vivo, and that the absence of active transport of MDL 73811 by the host's cells may play a role in the selectivity of this drug.","['Marion Merrell Dow Research Institute, Cincinnati, OH 45215.']",,,,,,,PMC1130950,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In our TS-PCR method, the point of modification is to use optimal concentrations of primers in the first amplification step in the range of 0.01-0.025 microM. This increases sensitivity and specificity enough to detect from 1 to 10(5) copies of template DNA without radioisotopes. This method is rapid because of completion in 1 day and is also applicable for quantitative detection of clinical specimens. The data show that the quantitative detection of HTLV-1 proviral sequences by this method correlates with the anti-HTLV-1 antibody titers from serologic analysis of seropositive healthy carriers. Moreover, the TS-PCR method using each specific primer was also attempted for successful detection of other viral genomes; therefore, the principle of this method is widely suitable for routine detection of genomes in the basic and clinical microbiological fields.","['Shionogi Institute for Medical Science, Osaka, Japan.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Suppression of both of these proto-oncogenes was shown to occur upon induction of terminal differentiation but not upon induction of growth inhibition in myeloid leukemia cells. Myeloblastic leukemia M1 cells that can be induced for terminal differentiation with the physiological hematopoietic inducers interleukin-6 and leukemia inhibitory factor were genetically manipulated to constitutively express a c-myb transgene. By using immediate-early to late genetic and morphological markers, it was shown that continuous expression of c-myb disrupts the genetic program of myeloid differentiation at a very early stage, which precedes the block previously shown to be exerted by deregulated c-myc, thereby indicating that the c-myb block is not mediated via deregulation of c-myc. Enforced c-myb expression also prevents the loss in leukemogenicity of M1 cells normally induced by interleukin-6 or leukemia inhibitory factor. Any changes which have taken place, including induction of myeloid differentiation primary response genes, eventually are reversed. Also, it was shown that suppression of c-myb, essential for terminal differentiation, is not intrinsic to growth inhibition. Taken together, these findings show that c-myb plays a key regulatory role in myeloid differentiation and substantiate the notion that deregulated expression of c-myb can play an important role in leukemogenicity.","['Department of Biochemistry and Biophysics, University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine, Philadelphia 19104-6059.']",['1RO1CA43618-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,PMC364442,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Considering the concentrations that reduced the cell viability in culture by 50%, most of the ethylene glycol ethers and in particular ethylene glycol monoethyl ether (EGEE) or ethylene glycol monobutyl ether (EGBE) should be considered as hemopoietic toxins. EGBE was found to be the most potent toxin on the human promyelocytic cell line, NB4 (median inhibitory concentration (IC50) 5 mM at 6 h; IC50 0.1 mM at 96 h) but also on the factor-dependent cell line DA1 (IC50 80 microM at 48 h). Factor-dependent cell lines were not significantly more sensitive than leukemic cell lines. The toxicity of these compounds falls in the same range of concentration as benzene or phenol, but hydroquinone was significantly more toxic in the same assay (IC50 3-15 microM at 48 h). Toxic effects increased linearly with time. The toxicity of ethylene glycol ethers was confirmed by both assays for colony-forming units in culture medium (CFU-C) (human blood cord cells) and murine bone marrow long-term culture (IC50 5-10 mM). Stromal cells in the adherent layer were more resistant than hemopoietic cells. An all or none toxicity was found within a narrow range of concentration (2-5 mM for EGBE), and chronic exposure over two months did not show cumulative effects on the culture cellularity. The possibility that fibroblastic or macrophage cells worked at the detoxification of the culture is suggested.

First, the effect of PMA on the expression of cell surface markers was assessed: a decrease of CD3 and CD4, and an enhanced expression of CD8 molecule were observed on T-ALL cells. Moreover, PMA exhibited an heterogenous effect on various activation-associated molecules such as a decreased expression of transferrin receptor and T10 molecule and an induced expression of 4F2 and CD9 molecules. It is known that functional high-affinity IL-2R are composed of at least two IL2 binding molecules, the alpha (p55) and beta (p70) chains. We found that PMA induced the expression of both IL-2R alpha and IL-2R beta chains, as well as IL-2 production by T-ALL cells. These effects were time- and dose-dependent. Cross-linking experiments with 125I-labelled recombinant IL-2 (125I-rIL-2) revealed both p55 (IL-R alpha) and p70 (IL-2R beta) IL-2-binding polypeptides, whereas binding equilibrium assays on PMA-treated cells demonstrated the presence of a low number (31-413) of high-affinity binding sites/cell in five out of six cases analysed, as well as intermediate affinity IL-2R (1234-3919 sites/cell) in four out of six cases, according to the time of incubation with PMA. In two cases tested high-affinity IL-2R on PMA-treated T-ALL cells could internalize 125I-rIL-2 at 37 degrees C. PMA alone enhanced the spontaneous proliferation of T-ALL cells in three cases, whereas a clear synergy between IL-2 and PMA could be detected in three patients' cells. Moreover, exogenous rIL-2 enhanced cell proliferation of PMA-preincubated T-ALL cells in four cases studied. Taken together, these observations indicate that a short-term incubation of T-ALL cells with PMA can activate the IL-2/IL-2R system on these cells without inducing strong modifications of their differentiation status. These results thus suggest that this system may be involved in the proliferation process of some activated immature T cells.","['Oncogenese Appliquee, INSERM U 268, Hopital Paul Brousse, Villejuif, France.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This can be amplified by the PCR using one pair of consensus primers. The PCR product is highly clone-specific in both size and sequence. Successful amplification was achieved in 50 of 62 cases of B-lineage ALL studied (81%). Both DNA and RNA gave almost identical results. In contrast amplification was only achieved in 2 of 42 control cases (non-B-lineage leukaemias, normal and reactive marrows); these were both cases of T-ALL with IgH rearrangement on Southern blotting. The main advantages of this technique over Southern blot assessment of clonality are the short time to result and requirement for much less DNA allowing study of small samples eg cerebrospinal fluid and testicular biopsies.

Viruses such as the murine radiation leukemia virus (RadLV) induce oncogenic transformation of T-cells in the thymus only in vivo and after a long latency. The capacity of RadLV to induce proliferation of lymphoid cells in vitro has been analysed here as a first attempt at mapping oncogenic transformation. Autonomously replicating cell lines have been isolated following exposure of splenic lymphocytes to two different isolates of RadLV, following in vitro culture in the presence of T-cell growth factors. Cells of similar precursor lymphoid morphology and phenotype have been isolated and cloned from cultures established from different animals. These cell lines all grow independently of exogenous growth factors in vitro, but are not tumorigenic in mice. Exposure to RadLV under the culture conditions provided has allowed integration of a new retroviral genome into each cell line, but no active replication of virus has been detected in any of the cell lines analysed. A common cell type resembling a lymphoid precursor has been induced to proliferate. These cell lines express cell surface markers attesting to their bone marrow origin, such as CD44 (Pgp-1), Gr-1, B220 and NK1.1, but they do not show the characteristics of T cells which have undergone differentiation within the thymus. They do not express the Thy-1 marker, nor show rearrangement involving any of the T-cell receptor (TCR) alpha, beta gamma or sigma genes. These cells bind several antibodies specific for the CD3-epsilon and TCR-alpha beta structures, and there appears to be aberrant expression of TCR proteins in cells bearing fully rearranged TCR genes. Precursor lymphoid cells and not mature T-cells in spleen, appear to be appropriate targets for RadLV-induced proliferation/immortalisation in vitro. Oncogenic transformation induced by RadLV in vivo may occur within precursor lymphoid cells and must be a complex process dependent on both the differentiation events which occur within the thymus, as well as the thymic environment of stromal cells.","['Division of Clinical Sciences, John Curtin School of Medical Research, Australian National University, Canberra, ACT.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Mediastinal clear cell lymphoma of B-cell type differed from FCCL in its regular lack of VLA-3, -5, and -6 and in frequently lacking VLA-4.

This indicates not only the biological heterogeneity of ALL cells but also that some of the characteristics of the cells are related to specific chromosome changes.","['First Department of Internal Medicine, Tokyo Medical College, Japan.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: The levels of TNF were measured in the serum of untreated patients, and in the culture supernatants of unstimulated and stimulated enriched hairy cells (HC). Furthermore, the presence of TNF mRNA transcripts in HC was analyzed. The possibility that HC could inhibit the in vitro growth of normal erythroid progenitors via the release of TNF was also investigated. Finally, in an attempt to correlate the circulating levels of TNF with the course of the disease, these were retested during and after treatment with interferon-alpha (IFN). RESULTS: Significantly increased levels of TNF were found in the sera of untreated HCL patients compared with normal control sera were seen from patients with other diseases (P less than .001), with values greater than 10 pg/mL in 21 of 42 samples tested. A significant decrease (P less than .01) of TNF levels was recorded following IFN-2a administration in 16 cases with detectable pretreatment serum levels of TNF. In two cases, an increase in TNF values was associated with persistence or progression of disease. The likelihood that the circulating levels of TNF were caused by the pathologic cells is supported by the evidence that purified HC may release TNF spontaneously. The values can be markedly increased following in vitro activation with the phorbol ester 12-0-tetradecanoylphorbol-13 acetate (PMA), with B-cell growth factor (BCGF), and, to a further extent, with the combination of PMA and BCGF. Furthermore, the constitutive mRNA for TNF was found in seven of eight HC samples analyzed. Although supernatants of enriched HC, were capable of reducing the growth of normal bone marrow erythroid progenitors by 50%, duplicate experiments using an anti-TNF antibody produced an almost complete disappearance of the inhibitory effect. CONCLUSION: The results of this study suggest that TNF plays an important role in the pathogenesis of the cytopenia(s) characteristically associated with HCL.","['Dipartimento di Scienze Biomediche e Oncologia Umana, Consiglio Nazionale delle Richerche, Torino, Italy.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: One hundred seventy-six patients received at least one course of HIDAC as part of a CALGB protocol designed to determine the optimal dose of cytarabine (ara-C) for postremission treatment of AML. HIDAC consisted of 3 g/m2 ara-C infused over 3 hours at 12-hour intervals on days 1, 3, and 5. The pretreatment characteristics of 170 patients were available for risk analyses. RESULTS: Eighteen patients (10%) experienced neurotoxicity. Univariate analyses demonstrated associations between the occurrence of neurotoxicity and elevated serum creatinine, age, and alkaline phosphatase (AP). Multivariate analysis showed that these variables were independent risk factors. These findings were used to construct a risk model with the following parameters: creatinine greater than or equal to 1.2 mg/dL, age greater than or equal to 40 years, and AP greater than or equal to 3 x normal. Seventeen of 46 (37%) patients with two or more of these criteria developed neurotoxicity compared with one of 124 (1%) patients with one or none. The sensitivity and specificity of this model were 94% and 81%, respectively. CONCLUSION: We conclude that patients with two or more of the following parameters may be at increased risk for HIDAC neurotoxicity: (creatinine greater than or equal to 1.2 mg/dL, age greater than or equal to 40, and AP greater than or equal to 3 x normal). However, this model should be confirmed by analysis of additional groups of patients treated with HIDAC.","['Division of Biostatistics and Epidemiology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02115.']","['5 U10 CA-31946-10/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-06516/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA-34183-08/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The nonimmunogenic, low class I-expressing, methylcholanthrene (MCA)-induced murine sarcoma cell line, MCA 101, is a poor presenter of endogenously generated viral antigens to specific CD8+ T lymphocytes and cannot be used to generate tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL). Since interferon gamma (IFN-gamma) has been shown to upregulate three sets of molecules important for antigen processing and presentation, we retrovirally transduced wild-type MCA 101 (101.WT) tumor with the mIFN-gamma cDNA to create the 101.NAT cell line. Unlike 101.WT, some clones of retrovirally transduced 101.NAT tumor expressed high levels of class I, and could be used to generate CD8+ TIL. More importantly, these TIL were therapeutic in vivo against established pulmonary metastases from the wild-type tumor. Although not uniformly cytotoxic amongst several separate cultures, these TIL did specifically release cytokines (IFN-gamma and tumor necrosis factor-alpha) in response to 101.WT targets. 101.WT's antigen presentation deficit was also reversed by gene modification with mIFN-gamma cDNA. 101.NAT had a greatly improved capacity to present viral antigens to CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes. These findings show that a nonimmunogenic tumor, incapable of generating a CD8+ T cell immune response, could be gene-modified to generate a therapeutically useful immune response against the wild-type tumor. This strategy may be useful in developing treatments for tumor histologies not thought to be susceptible to T cell-based immunotherapy.","['Surgery Branch, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland 20892.']","['Z01 BC010763-01/ImNIH/Intramural NIH HHS/United States', 'Z99 CA999999/ImNIH/Intramural NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,PMC1974839,,,,['NIHMS27579'],,,,,,,,,,

Moreover, significantly more bacteraemias were noted in the ketoconazole group (n = 37) than in the placebo group (n = 21) (P = 0.004).

In contrast, the amount of the noncatalytic beta subunit remains constant throughout the course of the response. Using both polyclonal antibodies to the holoenzyme and monoclonal antibodies to the alpha/alpha' subunits, we detected a cross-reactive 68-kDa protein, which we refer to as lambda. This protein is present in high abundance in resting T cells but decreases upon cell stimulation, as both MAT activity and the amount of the catalytic alpha/alpha' subunits increase. The decrease in lambda and increase in alpha/alpha' occurs after interleukin-2 production and before DNA synthesis. lambda virtually disappears when the cells are actively dividing. Several continuous T cell lines (HPB-ALL, MOLT-4, and Jurkat) as well as a freshly isolated T cell leukemia (ALL-2) had no detectable lambda. The Km for L-methionine for enzyme from resting peripheral blood mononuclear cells was 19-23 microM, which is 3-8-fold higher than purified MAT from fresh leukemic cells or enzyme from Jurkat cells, both of which have a Km of 3.5-3.8 microM. Kinetic analysis of enzyme activity from activated peripheral blood mononuclear cells suggested the presence of two forms of enzyme catalyzing the synthesis of AdoMet. After separation of lambda from the alpha and beta subunits by hydrophobic chromatography, it was determined that lambda has MAT activity but that it is significantly less active than the form containing the alpha subunit. It therefore appears that in resting T cells MAT is sequestered as a less active form. We hypothesize that lambda is a precursor to the catalytic subunits of human lymphocyte MAT and propose that the transition from lambda to alpha/alpha' may be important in the response of T cells to mitogenic signals.","['Research Service, Veterans Administration Medical Center, Memphis, Tennessee 38104.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

At 37 degrees C, the interaction of LIF with its high affinity receptor was more complicated, since occupied LIF receptors were internalized more rapidly than unoccupied receptors, internalized LIF was hydrolyzed and released from the cell, and new receptors were synthesized and expressed on the cell surface. Interestingly, when membranes were prepared from cells that expressed only high affinity receptors, both high and low affinity receptors were detected, while after detergent solubilization of membranes only low affinity receptors were apparent. These results are discussed in terms of a structural model for the LIF receptor in which interaction of a low affinity binding subunit and a second nonbinding subunit is required for the generation of the high affinity receptor.","['Walter and Eliza Hall Institute for Medical Research, Parkville, Victoria, Australia.']",['CA-22556/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Interstitial pneumonia occurred in 7/58 patients (12%) and was fatal in six. Three different pre-bone-marrow transplantation conditioning regimens were employed. Total body irradiation was delivered according to a hyperfractionated scheme of 12 fractions given three per day 5 hr apart for 4 days. Twenty-three patients received 36 mg/Kg procarbazine, 1275 UL/Kg antithymocite globulin, 14.4 Gy hyperfractionated total body irradiation and 120 mg/Kg cyclophosphamide. Only one patient developed interstitial pneumonia, but two rejected the graft and 10 relapsed. As a consequence, the total hyperfractionated scheme was increased to 15,6 Gy, cyclophosphamide to 200 mg/Kg, antithymocite globulin to 3400 UL/Kg and procarbazine eliminated. There were three cases of interstitial pneumonia, no rejection and four relapses in the 17 patients who received this regimen. In the last 18 patients hyperfractionated total body irradiation was reduced to 15 Gy, cyclophosphamide to 100 mg/Kg, and 10 mg/Kg of the myeloablative agent thiothepa added to enhance the cytoreductive effect without significantly increasing extramedullary toxicity. Three cases of interstitial pneumonia, one relapse but no rejection were recorded. Our results demonstrate that the absence of graft-versus-host disease due to T-cell depletion, and radio-chemotherapy doses and schedules used for the conditioning regimen each contributed to reducing the risk of interstitial pneumonitis. Hyperfractionated total body irradiation therefore, seems to play an important role in lowering the incidence of this complication.","['Radiation Oncology Service, Policlinico Monteluce, Perugia, Italy.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To determine whether or not there exist intracellular regulatory factors responsible for Thy-1 gene expression, Thy-1a allele was transfected into Thy-1(Thy-1.2-) FL2-52-2 and Thy-1- FL2-52-2-1-1. The transfected Thy-1a allele was expressed in Thy-1- FL2-52-2, but not in Thy-1- FL2-52-2-1-1, indicating the presence of the intracellular regulatory factors requisite for Thy-1 gene expression in Thy-1- FL2-52-2. It appeared that in Thy-1- FL2-52-2-1-1, Thy-1 gene was not expressed because of the absence of the intracellular regulatory factors although the 5' region of the Thy-1 gene was demethylated. These results indicated the existence of at least two regulatory mechanisms of Thy-1 gene expression in immature B cells: methylation of the 5' region of the Thy-1 gene and intracellular regulatory factors.","['Osaka University Medical School, Department of Medicine III, Japan.']",,,,,['Thy-1'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the present study, we investigated whether the expression of IL-2R alpha is associated with the process of differentiation of myeloid cells to mature macrophages and how this expression is regulated. The murine myeloid M1 cell line, which can be induced by leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) or interleukin 6 (IL-6) to differentiate from blast cells to mature macrophages, was used as a model system for myeloid differentiation. Bone marrow (BM)-derived macrophages were used as mature myeloid cells. Cytofluorometry revealed that IL-2R alpha is transiently expressed during M1 cell differentiation, with peak levels 24 h after induction by LIF or IL-6, whereas the high affinity receptor for monomeric IgG2a (FcR), a surface marker typical for macrophage differentiation, continues to rise up to 72 h. BM-derived macrophages already express FcR but not IL-2R alpha. IL-2R alpha expression is induced on these cells after treatment by IL-6 for up to 48 h. Treatment of IL-6-induced M1 cells with indomethacin permitted a sustained expression of IL-2R alpha beyond 24 h, and this effect was reversed by the addition of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2). Northern analysis showed that in M1 cells the expression of mRNA for IL-2R alpha, but not for IL-2R beta, is also transient, indicating that cell surface expression of IL-2R alpha is regulated at the mRNA level. These data show that inducers of macrophage differentiation such as LIF and IL-6 can induce a transient expression of the IL-2R alpha-chain in differentiating murine myeloid M1 cells and that autocrine production of PGE2 is involved in the control of the transient expression of this receptor. However, induction of expression of IL-2R alpha by IL-6 appears to be independent of differentiation because it can be induced on fully differentiated BM-derived macrophages as well.","['Division of Cytokine Biology, Food and Drug Administration, Bethesda, Maryland 20892.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This inhibitory effect of iron, which is not due to an enhanced cytotoxicity towards THP-1 cells, is increased by enhancement of iron concentrations in a dose-dependent relationship and can be partially reversed by increasing amounts of the cytokine. The iron-mediated inhibition of the effects of IFN-gamma is fully reversed when iron is administered concomitantly with equimolar concentrations of the iron chelator deferoxamine. Furthermore, deferoxamine alone is even able to enhance the efficiency of the IFN-gamma signal. Our data provide evidence that there is an inverse correlation between the intracellular amount of iron, which is not bound to ferritin, and the activity of the IFN-gamma signal. This suggests that iron withholding by the immune cells in the course of inflammatory disorders may also contribute to the enhancement of the cytopathic effect of IFN-gamma. This speculation is confirmed by the observation of high concentrations of immune activation markers such as IFN-gamma and neopterin and low serum iron levels in patients with hypoferric anemia in the course of chronic inflammation.","['Institute for Medical Chemistry and Biochemistry, University of Innsbruck, Austria.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the function of this receptor on these cells and its regulation are less certain. Studies to further investigate Fc gamma RII on platelets are limited by the inability to culture platelets in vitro. Therefore, identification of a human cell line that expresses Fc gamma RII as its only Fc gamma receptor as well as other platelet characteristics would be of potential importance. To this end, we examined Fc gamma receptor expression by the human erythroleukemia (HEL) cell line, which expresses platelet/megakaryocyte surface proteins. Flow cytometry studies on HEL cells with anti-Fc gamma receptor monoclonal antibodies revealed that, similar to platelets and megakaryocytes, Fc gamma RII is the only Fc gamma receptor expressed on the cell surface. Furthermore, Northern blot analysis revealed that Fc gamma RII is the only Fc gamma receptor mRNA present. Stimulation with dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) or 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) did not alter Fc gamma RII protein or mRNA expression. Ligand binding studies with [125I]IgG trimer indicated that HEL cells express 92,240 +/- 5030 binding sites per cell, with a kd of 1.94 +/- 0.31 x 10(-8) M. Similar to human platelets, HEL cells preferentially bound oligomeric IgG, and this binding was ionic strength dependent. These observations are similar to those previously observed with Fc gamma RII on human platelets and suggest that the HEL cell Fc gamma receptor is similar, if not identical to the platelet Fc gamma RII receptor. HEL cells may serve as a model for the study of platelet/megakaryocyte Fc gamma RII.","['University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine, Philadelphia 19104-4283.']","['AI-22193/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'HL-40378/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In parallel, these patients received GM-CSF s.c. at 125 micrograms/m2/day, or in escalated doses starting with 10 micrograms/m2/day for a week or until circulating blast counts reached 50 x 10(9)/liter, in an effort to sensitize leukemic blasts to cell-cycle-specific agents. Results of in vivo GM-CSF treatment were correlated with those of in vitro assays. In 9 of 12 patients (75%), GM-CSF treatment increased peripheral blood blast counts (in vivo effect). GM-CSF also stimulated in vitro AML blast colony proliferation in these nine patients and increased the S+G2M phases of the cell cycle in five out of five of these patients' samples. Two of three patients in whom an in vivo response could not be demonstrated also failed to have a detectable in vitro response. These observations suggest that the AML blast colony culture assay may be useful in predicting the response of AML to cytokine therapy. Finally, GM-CSF stimulated granulocyte-macrophage (granulocyte-macrophage colony-forming units, CFU-GM) and erythroid (erythroid burst-forming units, BFU-E) colony proliferation in 14 and 11 patients, respectively, including the 3 individuals who demonstrated no clinical effect on blast counts. It is, therefore, possible that GM-CSF may be used to stimulate proliferation of progenitors that differentiate into mature granulocyte, monocyte-macrophage, and erythroid cells.","['Department of Clinical Immunology and Biological Therapy, University of Texas, M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston 77030.']",['CA-16672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The progeny of a single, abnormal, hematopoietic stem cell gain a growth advantage over their normal counterparts resulting in overproduction of red cells generally accompanied by overproduction of granulocytes and platelets as well. There are a variety of nonspecific symptoms at onset related to the increased red cell mass and hematocrit accompanied by the more specific manifestations of pruritus, erythromelalgia, and hepatic, portal, and mesenteric vein thrombosis. Splenomegaly and hypertension are common. The laboratory hallmark is an increased red cell mass. There is also often an increase in white cell count, platelet count, and leukocyte alkaline phosphatase along with other findings reflecting the increased rate of turnover of hematopoietic cells. The bone marrow biopsy generally displays hypercellularity involving all three cell lines and absent iron stores. The diagnosis of PV depends on excluding spurious polycythemia in which there is a high hematocrit but a normal red cell mass and secondary polycythemia in which there is an increased red cell mass in response to tissue hypoxia or the inappropriate production of erythropoietin, generally by a tumor. In addition, one should try to establish the diagnosis in a positive fashion by a combination of studies of the blood and bone marrow. Phlebotomy and occasionally plateletpheresis should be used as acute therapy. Chronic therapy is guided by the knowledge that patients treated with phlebotomy alone have an increased rate of thrombotic complications particularly in older patients and those with previous thrombotic disease. Myelosuppressive therapy can reduce the incidence of these complications, but is commonly associated with an increased incidence of second malignancies, particularly acute leukemia. At present, hydroxyurea is the myelosuppressive agent of choice. Antiplatelet agents have a limited role except in the palliation of the syndrome of erythromelalgia. Median survival is approximately 10 years. As implied above, the causes of morbidity and mortality vary with the mode of chronic therapy which has been employed, leukemia being more common after myelosuppressive therapy and thrombotic complications being more common after therapy with phlebotomy alone. Ten percent to 50% of patients move into a spent phase followed by postpolycythemic myeloid metaplasia, irrespective of previous therapy employed. Eventually, the major problems may be cytopenias and massive splenomegaly.","['Jefferson Medical College, Thomas Jefferson University, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.']",,,,160,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The clinical utility of agents such as doxorubicin and daunorubicin and their well-characterized cardiotoxicity have prompted many efforts to develop analogs that retain the desired spectrum of activity but are less cardiotoxic. One such analog is idarubicin (4-demethoxydaunorubicin), which is currently under study in the treatment of adult and pediatric leukemias. The major circulating metabolite of idarubicin is the alcohol product of ketoreductase biotransformation, idarubicinol. Following the administration of idarubicin to adult or pediatric patients, systemic exposure to idarubicinol is greater than that to idarubicin. Moreover, we have also documented the presence of idarubicinol in the cerebrospinal fluid of pediatric patients who have received idarubicin. Idarubicinol has been reported to have greater cytotoxic activity than other anthracycline alcohol metabolites, which are regarded as much less active products of metabolism. We therefore evaluated the growth-inhibitory and DNA-damaging activities of idarubicin, daunorubicin, doxorubicin, epirubicin, and their alcohol metabolites against three relevant (CCRF-CEM lymphoblastic leukemia, K562 myelogenous leukemia, and U87-MG glioblastoma) human tumor cell lines. We found that whereas idarubicin was 2-5 times more potent than the other three anthracycline analogs against these tumor cell lines, idarubicinol was 16-122 times more active than the other alcohol metabolites against the same three cell lines. In addition, idarubicinol and the parent drug idarubicin were equipotent, unlike the other anthracycline alcohol metabolites, which were much less cytotoxic than the corresponding parent drugs. We also assessed the ability of the four parent drugs and their alcohol metabolites to induce DNA single-strand breaks. Idarubicin was more potent than the other three anthracycline analogs and idarubicinol was much more effective than the other alcohol metabolites in inducing DNA damage. These studies in human leukemia and human glioblastoma cell lines support the hypothesis that idarubicinol plays an important role in the antitumor activity of idarubicin and that the activities of idarubicin and idarubicinol are related to their ability to damage DNA.","['Department of Oncology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN 55905.']",['CA 15083/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

After screening by ELISA for reactivity to K562 membrane glycoproteins, two monoclonal antibodies were identified (mAb 35 and mAb 36). One of the monoclonal antibodies (mAb 36) was found to inhibit conjugation between LGL and K562 target cells and also to inhibit lysis of K562 by LGL. Upon further testing, mAb 36 also inhibited the binding between LGL and other NK-susceptible target cells, e.g., Daudi and Molt 4. In contrast, mAb 35, even though binding to K562, did not inhibit the binding of LGL to tumor targets and therefore was used as an isotype control. When mAb 36 was utilized as an affinity matrix, bound proteins specifically inhibited CD3- LGL-K562 conjugation. Experiments involving tunicamycin treatment of tumor target cells demonstrated that mAb 36 recognized a carbohydrate moiety rather than the protein core. Therefore, these data suggested that the target cell recognition molecule which is recognized by mAb 36 appears to be a membrane carbohydrate-associated molecule.","['Israel Institute for Biological Research, Ness-Ziona.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

DESIGN: Observational study of trends in incidence of childhood leukaemia in relation to estimated radiation exposures due to fallout from atmospheric nuclear weapons testing during the 1950s and 1960s. SETTING: Nordic countries. SUBJECTS: Children aged under 15 years. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Incidence rates of leukaemia by age at diagnosis, sex, country, and calendar year of diagnosis or year of birth; exposure category; relation between leukaemia and exposure for children aged 0-14 and 0-4 separately. RESULTS: During the high fallout period the average estimated dose equivalent to the fetal red bone marrow was around 140 mu Sv and the average annual testicular dose 140 mu Sv. There was little evidence of increased incidence of leukaemia among children born in these years. Doses to the red bone marrow of a child after birth were higher, and during the high exposure period children would have been subjected to an additional dose equivalent of around 1500 mu Sv, similar to doses received by children in several parts of central and eastern Europe owing to the Chernobyl accident and about 50% greater than the annual dose equivalent to the red bone marrow of a child from natural radiation. leukaemia incidence and red marrow dose was not related overall, but rates of leukaemia in the high exposure period were slightly higher than in the surrounding medium exposure period (relative risk for ages 0-14: 1.07, 95% confidence interval 1.00 to 1.14; for ages 0-4: 1.11, 1.00 to 1.24). CONCLUSIONS: Current predicted risks of childhood leukaemia after exposure to radiation are not greatly underestimated for low dose rate exposures.","['Imperial Cancer Research Fund Cancer Epidemiology Unit, University of Oxford, Radcliffe Infirmary, United Kingdom.']",,,,,,,PMC1881723,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Remission induction is usually with cytarabine and an anthracycline. Daunorubicin is commonly used but recent data suggest idarubicin or mitoxantrone are equally effective, possibly better. High-dose cytarabine has also been used for remission induction but is not proven superior. Post-remission treatment is typically with two or more courses of drugs similar to those used for remission induction. Other studies use non-cross resistant drugs and/or high-dose cytarabine. Although some data favor use of high-dose cytarabine, no approach is clearly superior. There is considerable controversy whether persons in first remission and with an HLA-identical sibling should receive a bone marrow transplant immediately or after relapse. Although transplant results appear superior, especially in persons less than 20 years of age, the most effective strategy may be reserving transplants for persons failing chemotherapy. This strategy also applies to persons receiving autologous transplants or transplants from alternative donors, like HLA-matched related or unrelated persons.","['Ida M. and Cecil H.

Extraordinary transfusion requirements of group O erythrocytes in a series of patients receiving unrelated minor ABO-incompatible marrow grafts led us to investigate whether this mechanism could account for the extent of hemolysis observed. In seven consecutive minor ABO-incompatible unrelated-donor bone marrow transplant recipients receiving cyclosporine without posttransplant methotrexate, we observed excessive hemolysis. For cases in this index group, a strongly reactive donor-derived ABO blood group antibody was identified coincident with development of hemolysis. Transfusion requirements in the first three patients (26 U of group O erythrocytes each) greatly exceeded the recipient's volume of incompatible erythrocytes, indicating that lysis of transfused group O erythrocytes was also occurring. Pretransplant erythrocyte exchange transfusion with group O erythrocytes performed in the four subsequent patients decreased the severity of hemolysis, but did not prevent it. Among minor ABO-incompatible marrow graft recipients, an analysis of variance demonstrated effects on transfusion requirements due to donor-recipient relationship being unrelated (P less than .002) and the use of posttransplant methotrexate (P = .0001), and there was interaction between these two factors (P less than .001). Bone marrow transplants from unrelated donors resulted in an exaggerated immune response to ABO blood group antigens, which was associated with hemolysis of transfused group O erythrocytes, as well as the patient's ABO-incompatible erythrocytes.

In this dose-escalation trial, CSP daily doses were 1 mg/kg in seven patients, 2.5 mg/kg in eight patients, or 3.75 mg/kg in four patients. Skin biopsies were obtained weekly after ABMT or on appearance of rash and were graded for GVH changes. Overall, 15 of 19 patients (79%) had cutaneous histopathologic grade 2 GVHD at a median of 33 days (range, 14 to 49) after ABMT; in 10, cutaneous manifestations were present at time of positive biopsy. The frequency, time to onset, and duration of GVHD were similar among the three CSP dosage groups. No patients had hepatic or gastrointestinal dysfunction attributable to GVHD or required specific therapy for GVHD. Positive biopsies for GVHD were seen in seven of eight patients who received full-course, full-dose CSP and 8 of 11 patients who had CSP discontinued or dosage reduced because of renal insufficiency. Three patients (one with positive biopsy) died with ABMT-related complications. Seven patients (four CR1, three CR2) relapsed with AML at a median of 411 days (range, 178 to 549) after ABMT; six of seven had positive biopsies for cutaneous GVHD. Nine patients (seven CR1, one CR2, and one CR3) are alive without relapse at a median of 501+ days (range, 252+ to 811+) after ABMT; eight of nine had cutaneous GVHD. Short-course CSP can induce autologous GVHD in recipients of chemopurged marrow autografts for AML, but randomized prospective trials are needed to determine whether this immunologic reaction is associated with alterations in leukemic relapse rate and disease-free survival after ABMT in AML.","['Oncology Center, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD.']","['CA54203/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA15396/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA40282/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",['Blood. 1992 Dec 1;80(11):2948-50.

It is found in several glandular epithelial tissues and human neutrophils, where it is localized to secondary granules. To examine the mechanisms controlling lactoferrin gene expression in neutrophils and defects in its expression in acute leukemia, we have cloned a lactoferrin cDNA from a chronic myelogenous leukemia library, and used it to obtain genomic clones representing the chromosomal lactoferrin gene. Using polymerase chain reaction, primer extension, and S1 analysis, we have identified the 5' end of the lactoferrin mRNA. We have defined a putative promoter region for the gene, and characterized its first two exons. In addition, we have examined the structure of these regions in DNA from HL60 cells. HL60 is a leukemic cell line that undergoes phenotypic neutrophil maturation on exposure to dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). However, the cells cannot be induced to express any secondary granule protein genes. We have shown that the 5' end of the lactoferrin gene, including the putative promoter region, is entirely normal in HL60. By Northern analysis, nuclear run-on studies, and primer extension assays we have shown that the gene is not transcribed in DMSO-induced HL60 cells. This supports the hypothesis that the defect in HL60 is an abnormality in the production or activity of a transacting regulator of lactoferrin gene expression.","['Department of Internal Medicine, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, CT 06510.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Breakpoints in both the dek gene on chromosome 6 and the can gene on chromosome 9 appear to occur in defined regions, which allows us to diagnose this type of leukemia at the molecular level. Moreover, because of the translocation a chimeric dek-can mRNA is formed which, as we show here, is an additional target for diagnosis via cDNA-preparation and the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). We studied 17 patients whose blood cells and/or bone marrow cells showed a t(6;9) with karyotypic analysis. Fourteen patients suffered from AML, one patient had a refractory anemia with excess of blasts in transformation (RAEBt), one patient had an acute myelofibrosis (AMF), and one patient a chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). In nine cases studies at the DNA and RNA levels were possible while in seven cases only the DNA could be analyzed. In one case only RNA was available. Conventional Southern blot analysis showed the presence of rearrangements of both the dek gene and the can gene. In both genes, breakpoints cluster in one intron in the patients investigated. The presence of a consistent chimeric dek-can product after cDNA preparation followed by the PCR was demonstrated. We conclude from our data that the t(6;9) is found in myeloproliferative disorders with typical clinical characteristics.

Enzyme levels of uninduced MELC were in between the very low AChE contents of erythroid cells and the huge amounts of activity exhibited by megakaryocytes and platelets. After MELC commitment to terminal division, the enzyme-specific activity increased largely, approaching values that were much closer to those of thrombocytic than of normal erythroid elements. The bulk of AChE activity in MELC, megakaryocytes, and platelets was found to be located in the cytosol as a free-soluble form. Moreover, during incubation, MELC actively released large amounts of AChE into the medium, like it occurs in murine thrombocytes. Conversely, the enzyme of the erythroid elements was mainly associated with the membranes and was not released extracellularly. Experiments with inducers showed that changes in AChE-specific activity of MELC correlated directly with the arrest of cell proliferation rather than with the activation of differentiated erythroid functions. The inverse relationship existing between MELC growth rates and AChE levels was further supported by the relative enzyme activities of the slow- and fast-growing subclones. We conclude that uninduced MELC potentially share properties of both the erythroid and megakaryoblastic phenotype. The latter might be revealed by typical regulation of AChE activity according to a thrombocytic-like program activated upon MELC commitment to terminal division. Eventually, the inhibition of MELC growth by exogenous pure bovine AChE suggested that the secreted murine enzyme might serve as a potential negative signal of cellular replication.","['Istituto di Patologia Generale, Universita di Firenze, Italy.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Furthermore, none of the 39 patients in the heparin group developed VOD after allogeneic BMT, versus 7 of 38 (18.4%) in the control group (P less than .01). This prophylactic effect was achieved without added risk of bleeding. Indeed, the low-dose heparin we used did not prolong the partial thromboplastin time and did not increase the red blood cell and platelet requirements.

Furthermore, because the analysis requires only small amounts of DNA, it allowed us to analyze samples early after BMT and during graft rejection. Results were obtained within 48 hours after blood sampling. Determination of MC in granulocytes (GR) and in mononuclear cells (Mnc) was performed in 20 patients treated for various hematologic malignancies. In patients who received untreated BM, recipient cells disappeared rapidly after BMT. In patients transplanted with T-cell-depleted BM, MC occurred in 15 of 16 cases. The percentage of host Mnc was always significantly higher than the percentage of host GR. The evolution of MC in patients who received T-cell-depleted marrow showed distinct patterns depending on whether patients remained in continuous complete remission, relapsed, or rejected their grafts. During complete remission, a relatively stable and significant number of host cells could be detected during the first 2 years after transplantation.

When the patients relapsed, an increase in host Mnc was monitored without significant changes in the number of donor Mnc. In contrast, after the relapse, donor GR were no longer detected.

With the knowledge that the NE gene expression is limited to early myeloid cell differentiation, mechanisms modulating expression of the NE gene were evaluated in the HL-60 promyelocytic leukemia cell line, a model of early bone marrow precursor cells. Consistent with the presence of NE messenger RNA (mRNA) transcripts in undifferentiated HL-60 cells, nuclear transcription run-on analyses showed that HL-60 cells actively transcribed the NE gene. However, the transcription rate of the NE gene was relatively low, only 40% of the myeloperoxidase gene, a gene expressed in parallel with NE. When induced toward the mononuclear phagocytic lineage with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), HL-60 cells exhibited marked suppression of NE gene transcription, declining to 17% of the resting rate within 2 days. Induction toward mononuclear phagocytic lineage differentiation caused no change in NE mRNA transcript half-life (T1/2), but mRNA levels decreased markedly over time, with levels undetectable 1.5 days after PMA stimulation. In contrast, when induced toward the myelocytic lineage with dimethyl sulfoxide, the rate of NE gene transcription increased 1.9-fold within 5 days. Interestingly, the mRNA transcript levels increased 2.5-fold by 5 days despite the fact that induction toward myelocytic lineage differentiation was accompanied by a marked reduction of NE mRNA transcript T1/2. Together, these observations suggest that the NE gene expression during bone marrow differentiation is modulated mainly at the transcriptional level, with some posttranscriptional modulation contributing, particularly during myelocytic lineage differentiation.","['Pulmonary Branch, National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Proportional breakdown by Asian subgroup is also considered. A total of 587 patients were registered, 49 of them of Asian origin. Breakdown to Asian versus non-Asian subgroups by diagnosis revealed comparatively high rates for Hodgkin's disease, retinoblastoma and neuroblastoma in the Asian patients. However, a deficit of cases was seen for CNS tumours. Comparison of overall age-standardized rates (ASR) for all cancers revealed a substantially lower value compared to that reported for the USA white population but a similar value to the USA black and UK white populations. Diagnostic breakdown revealed that the major difference between the West Midlands Regional Children's Tumour Research Group (WMRCTRG) and the USA white ASR was in the leukaemia and lymphoma group. Overall survival for the series was 56% at 5 years. The poorest prognosis was found in acute myeloid leukaemia, with only 23% of patients surviving at 5 years, against 62% in acute lymphoblastic leukaemia. CNS tumours also had a poor outcome, with an overall survival rate of 47%, although certain individual diagnoses were more favourable. We observed a 100% survival rate in Hodgkin's disease up to 5 years from diagnosis, and both Wilms' tumour and retinoblastoma had 90% survival rates.","[""West Midlands Regional Children's Tumour Research Group, Children's Hospital, Birmingham, UK.""]",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is widely thought that proto-oncogene alterations are associated with the induction of murine lymphomas; however, few, if any primary murine radiation-induced lymphomas possess (proto-)oncogene alterations. Independently derived cell lines grown directly (i.e., without in vivo transplantation) from thymic lymphomas of irradiated C57BL/6 mice possess the properties of immortalized pre-T cells and lack many of the characteristics of ""tumor cells"". PXTL cells are poorly tumorigenic upon transplantation, do not clone in methylcellulose cultures, are growth factor dependent and autocrine, and lack consistent chromosome and oncogene abnormalities. However, the thymic lymphomas are malignant and cause the death of each afflicted mouse. PXTL cells expressed two immunologically distinct forms of the tumor suppressor protein p53 that have moderately increased stability (t1/2 = 1 h) when compared with p53 of normal splenic T lymphocytes. Early PXTL cells could progress in vitro to a fully tumorigenic phenotype after infection with retroviruses encoding the c-myc and v-ras oncogenes. Progressed T-lymphoma cells acquired growth factor independence, a highly transplantable and tumorigenic phenotype, and the ability to quantitatively clone in methylcellulose cultures. Progressed lymphoma cells coordinately downregulated the expression of five T-cell differentiation markers, upregulated the expression of CD44 (Pgp-1), and harbored vastly elevated levels of two immunologically distinct forms of p53. Our results suggest that the early thymic lymphomas consist of differentiation-inhibited, immortal pre-T cells that are precursors to progressed, fully tumorigenic T-lymphoma cells.","['UCSD Cancer Center, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla 92093-0063.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The yeast invertase protein, fused at its third amino acid residue to the amino-terminal signal sequence and 17 residues of the mature M-MuLV env protein, retained its enzymatic activity and was secreted from mammalian cells. However, env protein fusions to the C-terminal portion of invertase were inactive. In contrast, some, but not all, env protein fusions at the C-terminal region of PLAP were enzymatically active: PLAP fusions containing long C-terminal portions of env localized to the rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER) and possessed low enzyme activity levels, while fusion constructs containing relatively short portions of the M-MuLV env gene localized to the Golgi and had higher activity levels. Those proteins that localized to the Golgi also were processed, in part, to forms of 67 to 68 kDa, the size of the mature PLAP protein. Since PLAP ordinarily is transferred to a phosphatidyl-inositol glycan tail (PIG-tail) in the Golgi and then transported to the plasma membrane, it appears that Golgi-localized PLAP-env fusions are processed imperfectly. PLAP itself, when expressed in Psi2 cells, accumulated at the plasma membrane and, unlike the PIG-tailed Thy-1 protein, was not incorporated into virus particles. Thus, the reported incorporation of the Thy-1 protein into M-MuLV virions does not appear to be a consequence of its glycoprotein tail.","['Vollum Institute, Portland, Oregon.']",['2 R01 CA47088-04A1/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,"['PLAP', 'env']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The assay is rapid, the time required for analysis is less than 30 min, and it is sensitive, up to 0.01 microgram/ml, which is three times below the toxic MTX concentration. Fifty plasma samples drawn from acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) patients were used to compare this method with that of fluorescence polarization immunoassay (FPIA). A good correlation (r = 0.979) was obtained between the results of the two analyses. FPIA constantly overestimates the concentration in samples collected during elimination and underestimates those collected during infusion. The difference between the means of the two methods was 29% and 13% for the elimination and infusion samples, respectively. The means of the peak height ratio of the metabolite to MTX in the HPLC chromatograms were 3.39 and 0.33 during elimination and infusion, respectively. The results therefore indicate that HPLC is more specific when tracing the washout of MTX concentration. Because of this specificity and simplicity, the method is recommended for therapeutic drug monitoring. The stability of MTX in human saliva was investigated in this study. MTX was found to be stable at room temperature and at -20 degrees C for a minimum of 3 h and 3 weeks, respectively.","['Pharmacokinetic Laboratory at KKUH, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

One patient with RA and the other with chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML), both of whose bone marrow CFU-Es did not increase at the higher dose of EPO in vitro, were treated with recombinant human EPO (rHuEPO), resulting in no effects. The responsiveness of patients with MDS to various recombinant hemopoietic factors might be predicted by both the residual degree of bone marrow hematopoietic precursor cells and the response of stem cells to the higher doses of each hemopoietic factor.","['Third Department of Internal Medicine, Akita University of Medicine.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The incidence of ALHL was 14%, and the mortality on the first week after diagnosis reached 20%, this being higher in ANLL. The actuarial median of complete remission duration was 9 months. The achievement of remission was associated with the morphological subtype, the patient's age and the presence of constitutional symptoms at onset, while the duration of remission was associated with the presence of fever and the need more than one chemotherapy course to attain remission. ALHL need new therapeutic strategies in order to diminish the rate of early death and to achieve longer survival.","['Servicio de Hematologia-Hemoterapia, Hospital La Fe, Valencia.']",,,"Leucemia aguda hiperleucocitaria.

Over the last decade a number of recurrent chromosome aberrations has been disclosed and some correlations with well defined histologic subsets of B-cell NHL has been established. Five important cytogenetic-histologic associations has been documented, well defined by combined cytologic, immunologic and genetic investigations: t(14;18) (q32;q21) and NHL of follicle centre cell origin, frequently with follicular histologic pattern; t(8;14) (q24;q32) and Burkitt's lymphoma, Burkitt-like lymphoma or the equivalent small non-cleaved cell category of the ""working formulation system""; t(3;22) (q27;q11) and diffuse large cell lymphoma; t(11;14) (q13;q32) and mantle zone lymphoma; trisomy 12 and chronic lymphocytic leukemia and well-differentiated small lymphocytic lymphoma. Molecular genetic studies elucidated some mechanisms operating during the normal lymphocyte differentiation which may be held responsible for the illegitimate recombination between the immunoglobulin genes and some oncogenes normally located on other chromosome regions. It has thus been demonstrated that the early events leading to neoplastic transformation in B-cell neoplasias occur in immature lymphocyte precursors in the bone marrow during the assembly of the immunoglobulin heavy chain gene. According to some recent studies chromosome changes may have prognostic value in B-cell NHL and chronic lymphocytic leukemia and may be employed in clinical practice in the construction of proportional hazard models in several histologic subsets of NHL.","['Istituto di Ematologia, Universita, Ferrara.']",,,Attuali vedute sui linfomi non Hodgkin.

During the early course of infection viral replication was found in the spleen and, more importantly, within the thymus. Of these organs, the thymus was affected most severely by ts1-infection. Thymic weights of infected mice decreased markedly during disease progression, culminating in severe atrophy at the time of paralysis. During the first 10 days after inoculation, the virus replicated within the endothelial lining of splenic and thymic capillaries and was released albuminally into the basement membrane before spreading outwardly into perithelial, epithelial, and reticuloendothelial cells. Within these cells there was productive viral replication and subsequent dissemination of the virus to the thymic T cell population. Early infection (up to 10 days after inoculation) of the thymus induced an increase in thymocytic mitosis, followed by a progressive increase in thymocytic death between 15 and 35 days after inoculation. Thymuses from paralyzed mice killed 30-39 days after inoculation, demonstrated pronounced involution, characterized by loss of lobular architecture, effacement of the cortex and medulla, severe depletion of thymocytes, and partial or complete loss of Hassall's corpuscles. Immunohistochemistry for viral antigens showed positive labeling of splenic megakaryocytes, reticuloendothelial cells, and thymocytes in mitosis, and reticulo-epithelial-endothelial cells of the thymus.

In comparison with the wild-type env gene, the BB6 variant contains a 159-bp deletion that eliminates the membrane-proximal portion of the extracellular domain and 58 point mutations resulting in 13 amino acid changes. Substitution of the variant env gene for the wild-type env gene resulted in a recombinant virus that produced a Friend virus-like disease in Fv-2r homozygotes.

We thus have direct evidence that the endemic form(s) of HTLV-II cause HCL infrequently, if at all. By comparison, there is reason to suspect that the viruses isolated from patients with HCL had an etiologic role in the disease in those patients. One way to reconcile these conflicting observations is to consider that isolates of HTLV-II might differ in oncogenic potential. To determine whether the structure of the putative oncogenic determinant of HTLV-II, tax2, might differ in the new isolates compared to the tax of the prototype HCL isolate, MO, four new functional tax cDNAs were cloned from new isolates. Sequence analysis showed only minor (0.9-2.0%) amino acid variation compared to the published sequence of MO tax2. Some codons were consistently different from published sequences of the MO virus, but in most cases, such variations were also found in each of two tax2 clones we isolated from the MO T-cell line. These variations rendered the new clones more similar to the tax1 of the pathogenic virus HTLV-I. Thus we find no evidence that pathologic determinants of HTLV-II can be assigned to the tax gene.","['United Blood Services, Albuquerque, New Mexico.']",['1RO1 CA55480/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Because this procedure has been performed increasingly and because larger numbers of patients are being followed for longer periods of time, the proper role of allogeneic BMT in this setting is becoming clearer. Data available thus far indicate that such an approach results in a complete remission rate of at least 50% to 60%, and even higher if applied as consolidation treatment in the remission phase, a transplant-related mortality reported as 40% to 50% and a long-term survival plateau at around 40%. The 40% 5-year probability of relapse-free survival is considerably higher than that observed following autologous BMT and may result from an allogeneic graft-versus-tumor effect (graft versus myeloma) similar to the well-recognized graft-versus-leukemia effect. Although follow-up is still too short to clearly identify the likelihood of cure for MM allotransplant recipients, a certain number of them are currently long-term, disease-free survivors and--we hope--cured. These promising results and the incurability of MM with conventional chemotherapy should, therefore, encourage further application of allogeneic BMT to selected patients with unfavorable prognostic features. Continued efforts to reduce the morbidity and mortality related to the procedure, as well as to design effective pretransplant regimens with lower extramedullary toxicity and to identify those patients most likely to benefit from BMT, will improve the value of allogeneic BMT in MM.","['University of Bologna, Italy.']",,,,34,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The degrees of resistance to CDDP and CBDCA, expressed as the ratio of IC50 for P388/DDP cells to IC50 for P388 cells, were 75-33 and 100-27, respectively, under the conditions of 2-24 h exposure to each drug at a density of 10(6) cells/ml. The corresponding values (25-7) for DWA2114R were relatively low. Accumulations of CDDP and CBDCA were reduced in P388/DDP cells; however, no reduction in accumulation of DWA2114R was observed at various exposure periods and concentrations of the drugs. The accumulations of CDDP in P388 and P388/DDP cells at drug concentrations corresponding to the IC50 values for drug exposure periods of 2-24 h were 0.41-0.97 and 13.1-33.7 ng Pt/10(7) cells, respectively, suggesting that an intracellular mechanism of resistance against CDDP could be activated in P388/DDP cells. P388/DDP cells also showed relatively low resistance to DWA2114R via this mechanism in comparison with CDDP and CBDCA. From the relationship between structure and activity of several Pt-complexes, these different properties of DWA2114R compared with CDDP and CBDCA could be due not only to the differences in carrier ligand structure but also to the properties of the whole molecule associated with the carrier ligand and leaving group.","['Exploratory Research Laboratories, Chugai Pharmaceutical Co.

Thus, although MAb was cytotoxic for 3C18 FLC in vitro in the presence of rabbit complement, the F(ab')2 fragment was ineffective in vivo, and the antitumor effect of MAb was abolished in mice treated with an antibody to CD4 and diminished in natural killer cell-deficient beige and athymic nude mice. MAb-treated mice surviving injection of FLC developed an immune response to 3C18 FLC.","['Department of Virology, Istituto Superiore di Sanita, Rome, Italy.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Experiments in cell-free systems have suggested that mammalian lamins A and C mediate an interaction between chromatin and the inner nuclear membrane that is essential for the reformation of the nucleus after mitosis. Other investigations, however, have suggested that lamins A and C are absent from myeloid cells and myeloid leukemia cell lines. To further investigate this apparent paradox, highly sensitive Western blotting techniques were utilized in the present study to examine the expression of lamins A and C in a series of human myeloid leukemia cell lines and in bone marrow samples from patients with acute nonlymphocytic leukemia (ANLL) and chronic myelogenous leukemia. Western blotting revealed that HL-60 progranulocytic leukemia cells contained an average of 0.1 x 10(6) copies of lamins A and C per cell compared to 0.5 x 10(6) copies of lamin B1 (the quantitatively prominent human B-type lamin) per cell. During the process of phorbol ester-induced maturation to macrophages, the mRNA for lamins A and C increased in abundance, with a concomitant 4-fold increase in the average cellular content of these polypeptides. To rule out the possibility that the low but detectable levels of lamins A and C observed in untreated HL-60 cells reflected incipient maturation, the content of lamins A and C was analyzed in ANLL cell lines that do not mature toward granulocytes or monocytes. Lamins A and C were readily detected in cell lines (KG1a, HEL, Mo-7e) derived from patients with a variety of subtypes of ANLL. Expression of lamins A and C was not limited to myeloid cell lines. These polypeptides were also detectable in marrow samples from 9 of 26 patients with ANLL including at least 1 patient from each of the 5 subtypes of ANLL examined. In contrast, only 1 of 12 marrow samples from patients with aggressive phase chronic myelogenous leukemia and chronic myelogenous leukemia in blast crisis contained readily detectable lamins A and C. The implications of these findings for current hypotheses regarding the functions of the lamin polypeptides are discussed.","['Oncology Center, Johns Hopkins Hospital, Baltimore, Maryland 21205.']","['CA06973/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA50435/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Expression of the BCL-2 gene has previously been correlated with cellular proliferation in normal and neoplastic lymphoid cells under a variety of experimental conditions. To examine the regulation of p26-BCL-2 protein levels during the cell cycle, we utilized the method of counterflow centrifugal elutriation to enrich for cells in various phases of the cell cycle. Relative levels of p26-BCL-2 protein were measured by immunoblotting, and comparisons were made with a cell cycle-regulated protein, p62-CYCLIN-A, and a protein whose levels are constant throughout the cell cycle, p36-PCNA (DNA polymerase-delta auxiliary factor). Relative levels of p26-BCL-2 and p36-PCNA did not vary among cell fractions enriched for specific phases of the cell cycle, whereas p62-CYCLIN-A was elevated in late S- and G2/M-phase cells. Similar results were obtained with lymphoma and leukemia cell lines that have either normal or translocated BCL-2 genes. These results obtained by elutriation were confirmed by pharmacologically inducing cell cycle arrest in proliferating lymphoid cell lines with hydroxyurea, quercetin, and nocodazole which blocked cells at S, G2, and M phases, respectively. Taken together, the data indicate that p26-BCL-2 is not a true cell cycle-regulated protein, although its levels can fluctuate in connection with changes in rates of cellular proliferation under some circumstances.","['University of Pennsylvania, Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Philadelphia 19104-6082.']",['CA-47956/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,"['BCL-2', 'C-MYC']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

BALB/c mice inoculated with up to 10(4) BCL1 were cured (greater than 1 year disease-free survival) following administration of intraperitoneal injections of recombinant human IL-2 (10(5) Cetus units x 3/day intraperitoneally x 5 days). Lethally irradiated BALB/c or (BALB/c x C57BL/6)F1 recipients were reconstituted with syngeneic bone marrow cells or T-cell-depleted C57BL/6 bone marrow cells contaminated with 10(4), 10(5), or 10(6) BCL1 to simulate quantitative MRD. Untreated mice died of typical leukemia without exception, whereas a substantial anti-leukemia effect was noted in mice treated by allogeneic spleen cells, IL-2, or particularly a combination of allogeneic spleen cells and IL-2 given concomitantly. Increments of donor-type spleen cells (10(6), 10(7), and 5 x 10(7)) or IL-2 (10(4) U x 2/day x 3 days) were given alone or in combination on days +1, +5, and +9 following Thy 1.2-depleted allogeneic BMT. All adoptive recipients of 10(5) spleen cells obtained from mice inoculated with 10(4) and 10(5) BCL1 treated by a combination of allogeneic spleen cells and IL-2 showed no evidence of disease greater than 100 days. The antitumor effects of allogeneic spleen cells alone and IL-2 alone were also highly significant, although not totally curative in all mice. Allogeneic spleen cells seemed more effective as compared with low dose IL-2 (3 courses of 2 x 10(4) U x 2/day x 3 days). None of the recipients of 10(6) BCL1 could be completely cured under the experimental conditions described without additional chemotherapy, although significant antitumor effects could again be documented following concomitant administration of allogeneic spleen cells and IL-2. Using an experimental model of autologous BMT, recipients of 10(3) tumor cells could also be cured following transplantation of syngeneic spleen cells by high-dose IL-2 (10(5) U x 3/day x 5 days) given at the time lymphocytes were present, optimally at 3 weeks following BMT. Based on encouraging results from experiments using our animal model of MRD, in conjunction with autologous and allogeneic BMT, pilot clinical trials are currently underway, investigating the effect of cytokine-mediated immunotherapy (CMI) in MRD following conventional and high-dose cytoreductive anticancer therapy in conjunction with ABMT. In addition, we are attempting induction of cell-mediated cytokine-activated immunotherapy (CCI) in conjunction with autologous and allogeneic BMT. Prospective randomized clinical trials and longer observation periods are required to assess the full efficacy of these new therapeutic modalities.","['Department of Bone Marrow Transplantation and Cancer Immunobiology Research Program, Hadassah University Hospital, Jerusalem, Israel.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

DESIGN: Cohort study and a case-control study. SETTING: Britain and population based National Register of Childhood Tumours. SUBJECTS: Cohort of 16,422 one year survivors of childhood cancer diagnosed in Britain between 1962 and 1983, among whom 22 secondary leukaemias were observed. A case-control study of 26 secondary leukaemias observed among survivors of childhood cancer diagnosed in Britain between 1940 and 1983; 96 controls were selected matched for sex, type of first cancer, age at first cancer, and interval to diagnosis of secondary leukaemia. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Dose of radiation averaged over patients' active bone marrow and total accumulated dose of epipodophyllotoxins, alkylating agents, vinca alkaloids, antimetabolites, and antibiotics (mg/m2) given for the original cancer. RESULTS: Cumulative risk of secondary leukaemia within the cohort did not exceed 0.5% over the initial five years beyond one year survival, except that after non-Hodgkin's lymphomas 1.4% of patients developed secondary leukaemia. Corresponding figure for patients treated for non-Hodgkin's lymphomas in the early 1980s was 4%. The relative risk of secondary leukaemia increased significantly with exposure to epipodophyllotoxins and dose of radiation averaged over patients' active bone marrow. Ten patients developed leukaemia after having an epipodophyllotoxin-teniposide in nine cases, etoposide in one. Chromosomal translocations involving 11q23 were observed relating to two secondary leukaemias from a total of six for which there were successful cytogenetic studies after administration of an epipodophyllotoxin. CONCLUSIONS: Epipodophyllotoxins acting alone or together with alkylating agents or radiation seem to be involved in secondary leukaemia after childhood cancer.","['Childhood Cancer Research Group, University of Oxford.']",,,,,,,PMC1882326,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Analysis of these antisera revealed that one (GSBl) was capable of detecting major protein changes in three independent isolates selected for anthracycline resistance. Thus, in studies using western blot analysis, the antiserum was found to be reactive with two proteins of 130 and 150 kDa which are present in plasma membranes of resistant but not sensitive cells. The antibody also reacted with a plasma membrane protein of 180 kDa that is present in sensitive cells but is increased in resistant isolates. Additional studies showed that P180 was greatly increased in both plasma membranes and endoplasmic reticulum in sensitive cells induced to differentiate in the presence of 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol13-acetate (TPA). Resistant cells treated under identical conditions showed only a slight increase in the levels of P180. TPA had no effect on the levels of P150 or P130. In contrast, differentiation of HL-60 cells in the presence of dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) resulted in the induction of P150 expression with major levels of protein contained in plasma membranes. DMSO has essentially no effect on the levels of plasma membrane P180, P150, or P130 in HL-60/Adr cells. These results therefore demonstrate a strong correlation between the development of resistance and the overexpression of proteins reactive with the GSBl antiserum. The results also show that development of anthracycline resistance in HL-60 cells results in the overexpression of P150, a protein associated with the differentiation of myeloid cells to granulocytes.","['Division of Biology, Kansas State University, Manhattan 66506.']",['CA-37585/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Southern blot study, using DNA probes for DQ52 and 5'D region genes, was useful to distinguish VDJ recombination from DJ recombination at the level of each allele. Leukemic cells from seven out of eight CD10-positive ALL patients showed biallelic VDJ recombinations. Rearrangements of Ig kappa genes were found in only one case. Leukemic cells from all of the CML.Ly-BC patients had a DJ/(V)DJ IgH genotype. These findings suggest that the multiple IgH gene rearrangements in B-precursor cell ALL occurred as a consequence of continuing V-(V)DJ rearrangements after neoplastic transformation, and were closely related to the stage of bone marrow B-precursor cell differentiation. Multiple IgH gene rearrangements in CML.Ly-BC might take place earlier in the process of IgH gene rearrangements than is the case in B-precursor cell ALL. In this sense, the genotypic oligoclonality observed in ALL and CML.Ly-BC should be regarded not as 'true', but as 'pseudo' oligoclonal leukemia.","['Second Department of Internal Medicine, Mie University School of Medicine, Tsu, Japan.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This is unfortunate, since a predictive plot illustrating the relationship between time to failure and a continuous covariate can be far more informative regarding the risk associated with the covariate than a Kaplan-Meier plot obtained by discretizing the variable. In this paper the predictive power of the Cox (1972, Journal of the Royal Statistical Society, Series B 34, 187-202) proportional hazards estimator and the Buckley-James (1979, Biometrika 66, 429-436) censored regression estimator are compared. Using computer simulations and heuristic arguments, it is shown that the choice of method depends on the censoring proportion, strength of the regression, the form of the censoring distribution, and the form of the failure distribution.

These leukemias are referred to as acute undifferentiated leukemia (AUL) and make up 2%-7% of the acute nonmyeloid leukemias. These leukemias are poorly defined in the literature and are also sometimes referred to as AML-MO. Most of the definitions include in the morphological and cytochemical criteria the expression of myeloid antigens. Here the value of these markers and of other techniques used in the diagnosis of undifferentiated or minimally differentiated leukemia is discussed. More than half of the leukemias that are undifferentiated by morphology and cytochemistry on the light-microscopic level show a positive reaction for myeloperoxidase by electron microscopy, which points to an early myeloid differentiation of those leukemias. Immunological marker analysis in most cases is inconclusive. Most show a positive reaction for CD 13, CD 33 or other myeloid-associated markers. However, in about half of these leukemias co-expression of lymphatic markers is seen. In a small minority, only lymphatic markers are expressed. Cytogenetic abnormalities which are found in these leukemias vary in type, and antigen receptor rearrangements are not lineage specific. Receptor studies, gene expression, and in vitro culture studies may, in the near future, contribute substantially to our knowledge about the commitment of these undifferentiated or minimally differentiated blasts. Recent definitions for AUL and AML-MO based on these different techniques are discussed.","['Department of Hematology, Dr. Daniel den Hoed Cancer Center, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.']",,,,57,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the present study we investigated TGF-beta gene expression in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and in B cells from patients with B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (B-CLL) and from normal controls. Monocyte depleted B-CLL cells expressed constitutively mRNA for TGF-beta 1 and secreted low amounts of TGF-beta activity into the culture medium. Stimulation of cells by phorbol ester noticeably enhanced mRNA levels as well as protein secretion in most cases. TGF-beta activity was of the same magnitude as in normal controls. We next analysed TGF-beta in highly enriched B lymphocytes from B-CLL (95-100% CD19+), and found that TGF-beta secretion was up to 3 times higher than in the original PBMC population. It is discussed that B-CLL cells might escape from negative regulation by TGF-beta and, on the other hand, inhibit normal haematopoietic cell proliferation and thereby achieve a growth advantage in the haematopoietic tissues.","['GSF-Institut fur Experimentelle Hamatologie, Munchen, Germany.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In an attempt to reduce the complications from dCF therapy, a pilot study of the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) first treated patients with interferon to improve peripheral blood cell counts before dCF treatment began. Thirty-four patients were treated for 3 months with recombinant interferon alpha-2a (rIFN alpha-2a), 3 x 10(6) IU subcutaneously three times a week for 3 months, and then by dCF, 4 mg/m2 intravenously every 2 weeks for a maximum of 12 months. The overall response rate was 94% (32/34); 76% of patients (26/34) had complete response (CR) (90% confidence interval, 62-88%) and 18% (6/34) partial response. One patient was found to have a Mycobacterium avium infection while receiving rIFN alpha-2a. Without specific antimycobacterial therapy and with continued administration of rIFN alpha-2a and dCF, the infection resolved and he achieved CR. Three patients had culture-negative febrile episodes during the dCF phase of treatment. Non-disseminated herpes zoster developed in four patients, but three of the episodes occurred only after treatment was discontinued. Sequential administration of rIFN alpha-2a and dCF resulted in fewer infections (P = 0.027) than in ECOG's previous study of dCF used alone. Two patients died, one of combined hairy cell leukaemia and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma of intermediate histologic type 17 months after entry into the study and the other of cardiac arrest 20 months after entry. Thirty-two patients were alive with a median follow-up of 21 months (range 13-31 months). This combination produces durable CRs with a low incidence of infection.","['Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN 55905.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To assess the value of these guidelines frozen cell samples of three patients with different haematological malignancies were sent to the 26 participating laboratories twice a year. Here we present the results with respect to the marker analysis and to the immunological diagnosis on 387 samples from 18 patients. A large inter-laboratory variation was seen in the percentage of positive cells for each marker, which influenced the valuation of a marker to be discordant positive in up to 23% and discordant negative in up to 40%. No single major factor could be traced to explain the large variation in the results. However, probably due to the balanced composition of the antibody panel and to the application of the guidelines for interpretation, this variation did not much influence the agreement in immunological diagnosis. In only 13/387 samples (3.3%) differences in the percentage of positive cells caused disagreement in the final diagnosis. In 23 samples (5.9%) the disagreement was due to an incorrect application of the guidelines. Quantitative data of single observations obtained from different laboratories, in which the materials and methods are not standardized, cannot be compared; but standardization of guidelines for marker sets and for interpretation contributes to a high grade of agreement in immunological diagnosis.","['Dr Daniel den Hoed Cancer Center, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These patients and/or their donors were immunized 7-13 d before transplantation with the recall antigen tetanus toxoid (TT) and the neo-antigen Helix pomatia haemocyanin (HPH). The recipients were booster immunized with both antigens at day 42 after transplantation. Transfer of a primary IgM and IgG response to HPH was successful in most paediatric and adult patients, but transfer of a secondary response to TT was established in only a few paediatric recipients. After booster immunization at day 42 most paediatric recipients responded with a rise in serum antibody titre to HPH as opposed to only two of 18 adult recipients. This incapability of the adult recipients to mount a secondary immune response may be related to their conditioning regimen which included Campath-IG in vivo. The results from this study indicate that transfer of immunity against recall- and neo-antigens is possible. However, the establishment of long-term memory may be affected by the regimen used to condition the graft recipient.","['Department of Paediatrics, Leiden University Hospital, The Netherlands.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Based on analysis of deletions of chromosome 7 in such patients, it has been suggested that there is a critical region of the chromosome lying within bands q21-q31. We have examined bone marrow and peripheral blood samples from 10 patients with MDS, AML and biphenotypic acute leukaemia who had monosomy for or rearrangement of chromosome 7, seeking evidence of non-random allele loss that might suggest the presence of imprinted genes on the chromosome. Bone marrow cells from one patient with the infant monosomy 7 syndrome had loss of maternal alleles as did two patients with biphenotypic leukaemia. Five out of five patients with MDS and both patients with de novo AML had loss of paternal alleles. One of the latter patients had a del(7) (q31q36) rather than monosomy 7. These findings suggest that imprinting of a gene(s) on chromosome 7, within the bands q31-q36, may be of importance in MDS and AML. Despite the reported increased incidence of AML amongst relatives of patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) the gene for which lies in chromosome region 7q31, none of the patients nor parents studied here appeared to be carriers of the most common gene mutation seen in patients with CF, the delta F508.","['Imperial Cancer Research Fund, Institute of Child Health, London.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Leukaemic cells in the following cases were positive for anti-Tac; 28/192 of acute myelocytic leukaemia (AML), 24/44 CML-BC, 4/28 CD19(+)CD10(-) acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL), and 20/64 common ALL (c-ALL).

None of the IL-2R alpha positive leukaemic cells responded to exogenous recombinant human IL-2 (rhIL-2) in culture. In addition, IL-2R alpha expression on non-T leukaemic cells was closely correlated with coexpressing different lineage markers and the presence of the Philadelphia abnormality. Marked increase of serum soluble IL-2R alpha was demonstrated in the IL-2R alpha(+) patients examined. Clinically, the IL-2R alpha(+) patients showed significantly lower response to chemotherapy and poorer prognosis than IL-2R alpha(-) patients. Our results clearly indicate the diagnostic importance of IL-2R alpha expression in non-T acute leukaemia with a close relation to the particular cellular characteristics and the prognosis.","['Second Department of Internal Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Mie University, Tsu, Japan.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The protein kinase inhibitor, 1-(5-isoquinolinyl-sulphonyl)-2-methylpiperazine (H-7) enhanced this differentiation dose-dependently. Upon addition of fetal calf serum (FCS) to the serum-free medium, the differentiation of ME-1 cells into granulocyte-like cells was inhibited and they resumed cell growth. We have recently reported that the differentiation of ME-1 cells into macrophage-like cells induced by IL-3 and GM-CSF involved the activation of protein kinase C.

U87 glioma and Daoy medulloblastoma, however, were less sensitive than normal glial cells to MC 540 photoinactivation.

Six patients (42.9%) had resistant disease, and four patients (28.6%) died during the myelosuppressive phase. Of the patients achieving complete remission, four relapsed and other two continued complete remission up to 27.3 months. Median remission duration was approximately 10.6 months. No significant difference was found with regard to the efficacy of our regimen between AML and ALL. Hematological toxicity was no more severe than the prior cumulative chemotherapy. Major non-hematologic side effects were nausea and vomiting (71.4%), stomatitis (64.3%) and liver dysfunction (57.1%), which were moderate and manageable, while no cardiotoxicity was observed in any patient.

A total of 18 patients, 17 of whom had solid tumors and one with acute leukemia, were included in this study. Lesions were observed daily prior to and 5 days after topical application of either vitamin E or placebo oil. RESULTS: Six of nine patients receiving vitamin E had complete resolution of their oral lesions. In eight of nine patients who received placebo, complete resolution of their oral lesions was not observed. This difference is statistically significant (p = 0.025 by Fisher's exact test). No toxicity was observed in this study. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that vitamin E may be an effective therapy in patients with chemotherapy-induced mucositis.","['Division of Medical Oncology, Veterans Administration Medical Center, Washington, D.C. 20422.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

They are present in polyclonal form in a large number of auto-immune disorders as well as in certain inflammatory states. In monoclonal form, they are frequently the product of ""mature"" malignant (chiefly Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia and chronic lymphoid leukemia) and allegedly benign (such as cryoglobulinemias) lymphoid proliferations. In addition, RF account for a significant part of the normal antibody repertory, notably during the fetal and neonatal periods, suggesting that they may play an important role in the development and regulation of the immune system. As a result, RF are an excellent model for the analysis of auto-immunity in man. Thus many indirect (analysis of antigens recognised and of idiotopes carried) and, more recently, direct (protein or nucleotide sequencing of their various regions) studies have now provided the following conclusions. RF are coded by a very limited repertory of V genes. These genes are present in the normal genome and appear to be highly preserved in the human species. They are used with very few somatic mutations by monoclonal B proliferations (which opens up valuable therapeutic possibilities) as well as probably by RF producing B lymphocytes in normal individuals. In contrast, in the context of auto-immune disorders, these same genes have many somatic mutations suggesting maturation governed by the antigen and/or escape from idiotype control.","[""Unite d'Immunologie Clinique et du Laboratoire d'Immunopathologie, CHU, Strasbourg.""]",,,Les facteurs rhumatoides.,50,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

ELP is expressed specifically in undifferentiated mouse embryonal carcinoma cells and participates in suppression of the Moloney murine leukemia virus genome. The zinc finger domain of the protein was fused with glutathione S-transferase and was successfully used for isolating genomic targets. Sixteen genomic fragments were isolated and twelve of them strongly interacted with ELP. Six of the ELP binding fragments were analyzed further. All of these contained the multiple binding sites for ELP, which matched well with the consensus binding sequence for FTZ-F1, YCAAGGYCR. Among these, three fragments functioned as negative regulatory elements in response to ELP, when placed upstream to the promoter region of the Moloney leukemia virus. These results indicate that ELP may function as a negative transcription factor for a variety of cellular sequences, in addition to suppressing expression of Moloney leukemia virus in early embryonal cells. It was also shown that the procedure employed here works well for isolation of genomic targets of transcription factors.","['Department of Pathology, Hiroshima University, Japan.']",,,,,,,PMC312225,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

From 1988, patients ineligible for aggressive chemotherapy entered a study of palliative treatment with Thioguanine and ARA-C. This 18 year GIMEMA experience showed that: CR can be obtained only with regimens producing marrow aplasia, the inclusion of anthracyclines or Mitoxantrone improves the CR rate, without prohibitive toxicity, haematological toxicity is very high in elderly patients and account for the most frequent cause of treatment failure namely death in aplasia, palliative treatment does not improve the quality of life and prolongs median survival only slightly. When comparing the results of these trials, it appears that in the GIMEMA group the capability of offering effective treatment to elderly patients with ANLL has continuously improved and that IDARAC plus Mitoxantrone is so far the most active and best tolerated regimen. Death in aplasia remains a major problem and future trials will be aimed at exploiting the possibility of reducing the haematological toxicity by using recombinant colony stimulating factors.","['Department of Haematology, San Giovanni Battista Regional Hospital, Molinette Torino, Italy.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Evaluating 213 responders remission duration was clearly longer in the maintenance group with 24% CCR after 5 and 10 years. In our 1985 study the same successful strategy was further intensified by a second induction course given regardless of response to the first course to all patients up to 60 years of age while older patients received standard induction as before. This age-adapted concept resulted in a further increase of 5 years CCR in the 461 responders to as much as 34% not achieved for unselected patients in other multicenter trials. 20 patients receiving auto-BMT in first CR show the same relapse free survival as their counterparts receiving chemotherapy according to the 1985 protocol in a matched-pair analysis. We conclude that both very early intensification and prolonged maintenance contribute to a higher cure rate that is not further improved even by a maximum intensity short-term treatment. The limits of chemotherapy in AML may be overcome by modulating its myelotoxicity and antileukemic potency using GM-CSF as shown in 2 studies of our group.","['Dept.

The complications of BMT are similar to those that occur following transplant for other diseases, notably GVHD, pneumonitis and infections. Of special interest is the demonstration that a graft-versus-leukaemia effect plays a role in the cure of CML. Studies using the polymerase chain reaction to detect minimal residual disease (BCR/ABL transcripts) may prove useful in predicting relapse and optimizing conditioning schedules. It is now important to test whether BMT can be equally successful in older patients (over 50 years) and in those lacking HLA-identical sibling donors. For other patients autografting may offer the possibility of achieving complete cytogenetic remission and perhaps prolonging life.","['Royal Postgraduate Medical School, London, UK.']",,,,7,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Fifty-six out of 67 remitters were enrolled for the early intensification, which consisted of HDAra-C+amsacrine (or IDAra-C+mitoxantrone) followed by vincristine+adriamycin+cyclophosphamide and etoposide+Ara-C. During the early intensification an unexpectedly high number of relapses (10/56) was observed, showing that very intensive treatment with myelosuppressive agents is not useful at this point of the post-remission therapy. One patient suffered toxic death. Out of 45 patients who completed the early intensification 16 had a related well-matched donor and were selected for allogeneic BMT (performed in 11); of the remaining 29 patients, 14 were randomized for autologous BMT (performed in 9) and 15 for a second intensification. The overall DFS at 3 years is 35%. The high number of early relapses makes it difficult to draw conclusions from the comparison of the three eradication modalities. The best results, although without statistical significance, were obtained after allogeneic BMT; in high-risk patients this procedure should be effected as soon as possible after attainment of CR. Autologous BMT and prolonged intensive chemotherapy gave results similar to each other; both were sometimes followed by delayed relapses.","['Cattedra di Ematologia, Universita di Pavia, Italy.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Indeed, patients in the 'standard risk' category (cALLA+ve, blast count less than 10 x 10(9)/l) fared better previously.

Study XI was significantly more effective than all previous St. Jude Total Therapy studies (especially for higher risk patients), could be delivered mostly in the outpatient setting, and, except for a single regimen, was largely free of serious side effects.","[""St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee.""]",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we consider these issues. Our conclusion is that more intensive treatment is more effective but that no specific regimen is superior. Further dose escalations are unlikely to increase cures substantially. Maintenance chemotherapy is effective; it may work by controlling the ALL clone so that normal mechanisms regulating B-cell survival operate. Cure of ALL is probably achieved by diverse mechanisms including leukemia eradication in children and leukemia control in adults. Assays of minimal residual leukemia are possible but should not yet be used to direct therapy. There are several reasons why some persons are incurable including treatment resistance and a stem cell origin of leukemia. In most children and adults, chemotherapy is the best strategy followed by allogeneic transplants in those who relapse. Autotransplants are of minimal efficacy. Finally we consider new therapy approaches including immune therapy and regulation of leukemia-related genes.","['Department of Medicine, UCLA School of Medicine 90024-1678.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The median duration of disease-free survival and long-term outcome from different post-remission therapies are summarized in Table 4. [table: see text] Despite the suggestive evidence of the ordered increment in value of intensive consolidation therapy, allogeneic and autologous bone marrow transplantation, it remains to be proved that the differences observed in our preceding studies are statistically significant and clinically meaningful. These remaining questions led to the current ECOG study, EST 3489, a randomized intergroup study conducted with members of the Southwest Oncology Group. The study includes all patients with de novo AML up to age 55; the schema is shown in Figure 3. Induction therapy consists of idarubicin plus cytarabine instead of DAT. A modified short course of this induction therapy is repeated after CR. Patients who have a histocompatible sibling are offered allogeneic bone marrow transplantation. The remaining patients are randomized to receive either autologous bone marrow transplantation or a single course of high-dose cytarabine. Autologous bone marrow transplantation utilizes the previously described high-dose busulfan and cyclophosphamide regimen plus 4-HC purging of the bone marrow. The dosage of cytarabine in the intensive consolidation arm is 3 gm/M2/day IV on days 1-6. The results of this study should determine the relative merits of these different approaches to post-remission therapy. [table: see text] As mentioned earlier, demonstration of improved CR rates is limited by the morbidity and mortality from the myelosuppression that results from induction therapy. This is especially marked for older patients with AML. In patients, ages 55-70 years old, the ECOG is conducting a randomized trial (EST 1490) of conventional induction therapy +/- GM-CSF to determine if accelerated neutrophil recovery can reduce the mortality of induction therapy and thereby increase the remission rate. It may be that the application of GM-CSF and other colony-stimulating factors can increase the CR rate for all patients, increasing the number of patients potentially eligible for cure by post-remission therapy.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

During the year 1985, the EBMT conducted a prospective evaluation study. In 12 centres 168 patients with AML were registered at the time of HLA-typing. Basic patient data and treatment intention were recorded. 79 patients were HLA-typed at diagnosis. 68 patients in 1st CR and 21 at other stages. Follow-up of these patients was obtained as of January 1, 1991. Three-year LFS is 44% for patients with an HLA-identical donor and 21% for those without (p = 0.02). Of the 68 patients HLA-typed in first CR, 40 had an HLA-identical donor and 28 no donor. Three-year LFS is 42% and 35%. resp. (n.s.). The difference in results between patients typed at diagnosis and first CR patients illustrates the problem of selection.

Major advances in immunology, in particular the development of monoclonal antibodies (McAb) with lineage specificity, have provided objective positive criteria for the diagnosis of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL). The FAB group has recognised the importance of McAb for the classification of some forms of acute myeloid leukaemia (AML), such as megakaryoblastic leukaemia, AML-M7, in which reactivity with McAb against platelet glycoproteins is a requirement for diagnosis. More recently the group has defined a type of myeloblastic leukaemia with minimal differentiation, AML-MO, in which myeloid cytochemistry is negative and the diagnosis is made by the expression of myeloid antigens and negative lymphoid markers in the blast cells. However, new problems have emerged with the wider use of McAb which now need to be addressed: the most important is the precise evaluation criteria for biphenotypic leukaemia for which we have proposed a scoring system in order to recognise the genuine cases which constitute a distinct disease entity. The role of karyotyping in the classification of acute leukaemia is gradually being defined (MIC proposals) and some forms of acute leukaemia can only be diagnosed by chromosome translocations, e.g. Ph+ ALL, resulting from t(9;22) and t(4;11) in infant ALL. Several translocations can also be demonstrated by molecular techniques. Cases with t(8;16) (p11;p13) are characterised by myelomonocytic features, erythrophagocytosis and fibrinolysis and represent a type of AML which can be defined primarily by its cytogenetic abnormality.","['Academic Department of Haematology and Cytogenetics, Royal Marsden Hospital, London, UK.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although the clinical manifestations were improved by the treatment, the disease recurred 5 weeks later. The patient was successfully treated by the same medications, and there has been no recurrence as of the sixth month after discontinuance of the therapy.

Autopsy revealed superior sagittal sinus thrombosis and bilateral cerebral infarction, but no obvious thrombus in other organs. Coagulopathy following L-ASP therapy is well-known. In this case, the coagulation studies at the first attack showed that the plasma protein levels of coagulation and fibrinolysis factors decreased in spite of administration of FFP.

The tetrahydro compounds were also of interest as non-polyglutamatable inhibitors of the purine biosynthetic enzyme glycinamide ribonucleotide formyltransferase (GARFT). Reductive coupling of N2-acetamido-6-formylpyrido[2,3-d]pyrimidin-4(3H)-one with 4-aminobenzoic acid, followed by N10-formylation, mixed anhydride condensation of the resultant N2-acetyl-N10-formyl-5- deazapteroic acid with L-homocysteic acid, and removal of the N2-acetyl and N10-formyl groups with NaOH, afforded N-(5-deazapteroyl)-L-homocysteic acid (5-dPteHCysA). Mixed anhydride condensation of N2-acetyl-N10-formyl- 5-deazapteroic acid with methyl D,L-2-amino-4-(diethoxyphosphinyl)butanoic acid, followed by consecutive treatment with Me3SiBr and NaOH, yielded D,L-2-[(5-deazapteroyl)amino]-4-phosphonobutanoic acid (5-dPteAPBA). Treatment with NaOH alone led to retention of one ethyl ester group on the phosphonate moiety. Catalytic hydrogenation of N2-acetyl-N10-formyl-5-deazapteroic acid followed by mixed anhydride condensation with methyl L-homocysteate and deprotection with NaOH afforded N-(5,6,7,8-tetrahydro-5-deazapteroyl)-L-homocysteic acid (5-dH4PteHCysA). Similar chemistry starting from methyl D,L-2-amino-4-(diethoxyphosphinyl)butanoic acid and methyl N delta-(benzyloxycarbonyl)-L-ornithinate yielded D,L-2-[(5-deaza-5,6,7,8-tetrahydropteroyl)amino]-4-phosphonobut ano ic acid (5-dH4Pte-APBA) and N alpha-(5-deaza-5,6,7,8-tetrahydropteroyl)-L-ornithine (5-dH4PteOrn), respectively. The 5-deazafolate analogues were inhibitors of mouse liver FPGS, and the DATHF analogues inhibited both mouse FPGS and mouse leukemic cell GARFT. Analogues with HCysA and monoethyl APBA side chains were less active as FPGS inhibitors than those containing an unesterified gamma-PO(OH)2 group, and their interaction with the enzyme was noncompetitive against variable folyl substrate. In contrast, Orn and APBA analogues obeyed competitive inhibition kinetics and were more potent, with Ki values as low as 30 nM. Comparison of the DATHF analogues as GARFT inhibitors indicated that the Orn side chain diminished activity relative to DATHF, but that the compounds with gamma-sulfonate or gamma-phosphonate substitution retained activity, with Ki values in the submicromolar range. The best GARFT inhibitor was the 5-dH4PteAPBA diastereomer mixture, with a Ki of 47 nM versus 65 nM for DATHF. None of the compounds showed activity against cultured WI-L2 or CEM human leukemic lymphoblasts at concentrations of up to 100 microM.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)","['Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts 02115.']","['CA39867/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA41461/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We investigated the effect of ADP on the concentration of intracellular free calcium ([Ca++]i) in fura-2-loaded K562 leukemia cells, a cell line with the potential for megakaryocytic differentiation. ADP causes a rapid and transient increase in [Ca++]i, which peaks within 5 to 10 sec. The EC50 for this response is 0.4 microM. A major portion of the increased calcium is due to mobilization of intracellular stores because the response to ADP is only partially reduced in the absence of extracellular calcium. Exposure to ADP desensitizes K562 cells to additional administrations of this nucleotide. Pretreatment of K562 cells with the protein kinase C activator phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate completely blocks the response to ADP. This effect of phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate is prevented by the protein kinase C inhibitor staurosporine, but staurosporine does not affect the progression of desensitization after repeated ADP exposures. ATP does not increase [Ca++]i in K562 cells, but antagonizes the response to ADP. We propose that the P2T receptor for ADP in K562 cells is an early marker for megakaryocytic differentiation. Furthermore, this immortalized nucleated cell line may be a useful model to decipher the signal transduction pathways involved in the ADP response.","['Division of Research and Testing, Food and Drug Administration, Washington, DC.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this sample, compliers and noncompliers did not differ with respect to either demographic variables (age, gender) or treatment variables (treatment duration, continuity, complexity, or parental involvement). Psychologic variables were assessed in 34 patients. Patients who adhered poorly to the therapeutic regimen had significantly less developed concepts of the illness (specifically, concepts of causality and prognosis), less perceived vulnerability (especially as related to subclinical disease), higher levels of denial as a psychologic defense, and less cohesive future orientation. The perceived health locus of control was not a significant factor. The results suggest that patients construct their own subjective view of the illness and its treatment, which then has implications for adherence to medication regimens.","[""Department of Pediatrics and Psychiatry, Schneider Children's Hospital, Long Island Jewish Medical Center, New Hyde Park, New York.""]",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To note if there is a correlation between morphology, karyotype, and these proto-oncogene expressions and if any one proto-oncogene can predict prognosis. METHOD: Bone marrow from 130 patients was analysed at six monthly intervals over two years for relative mRNA expression of seven oncogenes, karyotype, and morphology. The technique used slot blot hybridisation and densitometric analysis. The results were compared with 14 surgical controls and 30 people with vitamin deficiency anaemia. RESULTS: Six of seven oncogenes showed increased expression which progressed with time, but did not correlate with morphological or karyotypic changes. Expression of four of the seven oncogenes was increased in megaloblastic and iron deficiency anaemia. C-mos showed differences among the five morphological subgroups; it correlated with abnormal location (p = 0.025) and seemed to influence prognosis. CONCLUSION: Increased proto-oncogenes reflect the overall marrow perturbation in MDS. C-mos may reflect persistence of monocyte pathway which confirms marrow stability.","['Department of Haematology, Leicester Royal Infirmary.']",,,,,,,PMC495276,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A., Kan, C.-C., and Kolesnick, R. N. (1991) J. Biol. Chem. 266, 11522-11527). The present studies show that glycosphingolipid synthesis is also involved. Initial studies demonstrated that the potent phorbol ester 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) stimulates a 6- and 12-fold increase in the levels of sialosyllactosylceramide (GM3) and glucosylceramide (GlcCer), respectively, during development of an adherent macrophage population. In contrast, the level of lactosylceramide (LacCer) decreased to 20% of unstimulated controls. These effects were specific to adherent macrophages as nonadherent cells had minimal alteration in the glycosphingolipid profile. D-Threo-1-phenyl-2-decanoylamino-3-morpholino-1-propanol (PDMP), a competitive inhibitor of UDP-glucose:ceramide glucosyltransferase (EC 2.4.1.80), selectively blocked adherence during macrophage differentiation. PDMP markedly reduced basal levels of GlcCer, LacCer, and GM3 and prevented TPA-stimulated effects. PDMP (0.03-10 microM) reduced adherence after TPA from 30 to 6% of the total population. PDMP did not block other aspects of phorbol ester-induced macrophage differentiation including growth inhibition, expression of mRNA transcripts for the proto-oncogenes c-fos and c-myc, development of the specific enzyme markers alpha-naphthyl acetate esterase and acid phosphatase, and the gross morphologic changes associated with macrophage differentiation. PDMP appeared to have no short term or prolonged toxic effect on HL-60 cells. These studies show that PDMP selectively blocked adherence of HL-60 cells during phorbol ester-induced macrophage differentiation and suggest that this compound may be useful in the description of the biologic roles of glycosphingolipids.","['Program of Molecular Pharmacology and Therapeutics, Sloan-Kettering Institute, Cornell University Medical College, New York, New York 10021.']",['R01-CA-42385/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We report here that the enzyme also acts in vitro on glycerophospholipids, lysophospholipids, and diacylglycerol. While AOAH preferentially removes palmitate or stearate from the sn-1 position of phospholipid and diacylglycerol substrates that have unsaturated acyl chains in the sn-2 position, it is able to cleave both palmitates from sn-1,2-dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine and sn-1,2-dipalmitoylglycerol. This apparent preference for removing saturated (or shorter) acyl chains from glycerolipids is consistent with its ability to cleave laurate more rapidly than palmitoleate from lipopolysaccharide (Erwin, A. L., and Munford, R. S. (1990) J. Biol. Chem. 265, 16444-16449). AOAH also catalyzes acyl transfer from LPS and phosphatidylethanolamine to acceptor lipids; approximately equal amounts of laurate and myristate are transferred from LPS to monooleoylglyceryl ether, forming acyloleoylglyceryl ether. The demonstration that AOAH has phospholipase, lysophospholipase, diacylglycerol lipase, and acyltransferase activities in vitro suggests that the enzyme may have roles in addition to LPS deacylation (detoxification) in phagocytic cells.","['Department of Internal Medicine, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas 75235.']",['AI18188/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is thought that anthracycline antitumor drugs exert their cytotoxicity by entering cells, diffusing into nuclei, and inhibiting topoisomerase II and/or intercalating DNA base pairs. In order to deliver anthracyclines to transferrin (TRF) receptors on the plasma membranes of human tumor cells, we have prepared conjugates of adriamycin (ADR) with human TRF. These TRF-ADR conjugates were found to be stable at low pH and to exert more efficient cytotoxicity than free drug. By using spectrofluorometry, we found that the fluorescence of ADR within the conjugate was quenched by native DNA, demonstrating the presence of conformationally available drug to intercalate with nuclear DNA. However, fluorescence was not quenched when conjugate was reacted with viable cells, indicating that ADR did not reach the nucleus. Results of fluorescence microscopy experiments confirmed that free but not conjugated ADR reached the nuclei of viable cells, and TRF-ADR conjugates labeled with fluorescein isothiocyanate were found to initiate lateral diffusion as determined by patch and cap reactions. The involvement of TRF receptors was shown by flow cytometry experiments in which native TRF inhibited binding of fluorescein-labeled TRF-ADR conjugates. These data suggest that TRF-ADR conjugates mediate cytotoxicity by a mechanism other than intercalation with nuclear DNA. This mechanism, revealed by conjugating ADR to a TRF carrier, may not initiate complications such as cardiotoxicity and drug resistance.","['Center for Reproduction and Transplantation Immunology, Methodist Hospital of Indiana, Indianapolis 46202.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Pre-established stromal cell layers were reinoculated with autologous cryopreserved mononuclear phagocyte- and T-lymphocyte-depleted bone marrow cells in the presence or absence of HILDA/LIF (200 U/ml). At weekly intervals cultures were sacrificed, and the cells in the adherent and the nonadherent cell fractions were counted.

The total number of cells, their differential counts, the number of HPC, and the concentrations of CSA in culture supernatants were similar for long-term cultures containing HILDA/LIF and for controls. These data suggest that HILDA/LIF may not play a role in the proliferation and differentiation of normal human (early) HPC in LTBMC.

Samples (n = 120) were obtained from normal individuals and patients with leukemia, myeloproliferative and rheumatologic disorders, solid tumors, and after bone marrow transplantation and chemotherapy. Patients were also grouped as to whether they had an ongoing inflammatory process, that is, an active infection, solid tumor malignancy, or rheumatological disorder. Serum IL-6 levels were 4.6 +/- 1.4 U/ml for normal individuals and ranged up to 14.8 x baseline; moderate increases (greater than 2 x normal) were found in 21.5% of all patients. Whereas only 39% of thrombocytopenic sera (less than 150,000 platelets) had elevated IL-6 levels, 91% of these sera were from patients with an ongoing inflammatory process. Only 29% of the thrombocytotic sera (greater than 400,000) had elevated IL-6 levels, but 86% of these sera were from patients suffering from concurrent inflammation. Overall, 80% of all patients with elevated serum IL-6 had definitive ongoing inflammatory processes. There was no inverse relationship between platelet numbers and IL-6 levels. Thus, the idea that IL-6 is TPO appears doubtful. However, production of IL-6 during inflammation may result in increased platelet numbers and account for the secondary thrombocytosis observed in some patients.","['Department of Biological Sciences, State University of New York, Cortland 13045.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Results presented herewith demonstrate that pretreatment of the human leukemic cells K562 and HL-60 with sublytic doses of antibody and normal human serum protects them from lytic complement concentrations, a phenomenon proposed to be called ""complement-induced protection"". C7- and C8-deficient human sera are ineffective in inducing resistance unless they are reconstituted with purified human C7 and C8, respectively. The complement-induced protection is inhibitable by actinomycin D and cycloheximide indicating that the increased complement resistance depends on RNA and protein synthesis triggered by the sublytic complement doses. Free extracellular Ca2+ is also required to achieve maximal protection, indicating a role for Ca2+ ions in the cell stimulatory events which culminate in increased complement resistance. Quantitative analysis of bound complement components indicated that similar amounts of C3 and C9 molecules are deposited on ""protected"" and control cells during complement activation. The ""protected"" K562 and HL-60 cells regain sensitivity to lytic MAC doses after about 8 or 3 h, respectively, of culture in growth medium, in the absence or presence of actinomycin D and cycloheximide. The ""induced protection"" is not species restricted and protection from human complement can be induced in K562 cells by treatment with sublytic doses of antibody and rabbit or guinea pig sera.","['Department of Chemical Immunology, Weizmann Institute of Science, Rehovot, Israel.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

(1990) J. Cell Biol. 110, 1655-1664]. This activity was not due to calpain, which was reported to degrade vimentin, because it was independent of the presence or absence of Ca2+. This activity was revealed to be strongly associated with membranes by differential-centrifugation experiments. To identify this protease, purification of the degradation enzyme was performed. A membrane fraction was prepared and extracted with a buffer containing Triton X-100, then subjected to column chromatography using carboxymethyl-Sepharose and heparin-Sepharose. Quantitative analysis using the purified protease revealed that the specificity of this protease was more than 1000-fold higher for vimentin than for bovine serum albumin, ovalbumin and actin. Four protein bands expressing the activity were finally identified by SDS/PAGE. Amino-terminal sequences of these four proteins were identical, suggesting lower-molecular-mass proteins were degradative products. Furthermore, it was revealed that the sequence had the highest similarity with that of human cathepsin G. This result was consistent with the cathpsin-G-like properties of the purified protease, such as the optimum pH and the specificities for inhibitors. The purified protease degraded a synthetic substrate for cathespin G, succinyl-alanyl-alanyl-prolyl-phenylalanyl-p-nitroanilide, with a comparable specific activity to human cathespin G and was specifically detected with anti-(human cathepsin G) serum in immunoblot analysis. The purified protease thus belongs to the 'cathepsin G family', and perhaps is a mouse homologue of human cathepsin G.","['Department of Cell Biology, Kyoto University, Japan.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Agonist activation of the receptors increases binding of the GTP analog, guanosine 5'-[gamma-thio]triphosphate (GTP[S]), to membrane G proteins, at 30 degrees C only in the presence of exogenous GDP. In contrast, at 0 degrees C fMet-Leu-Phe stimulated binding of GTP[S] to G proteins maximally without addition of GDP. Under conditions resulting in marked degradation of membrane-bound GDP, control binding of GTP[S] measured at 0 degrees C was significantly increased, whereas the extent of agonist-stimulated binding was reduced. Furthermore, there was a rapid spontaneous release of membrane-bound GDP at 30 degrees C, but not at 0 degrees C. The data suggest that in intact membranes of HL 60 cells G proteins are initially in a GDP-liganded form, which state allows the receptor-induced exchange of bound GDP for GTP[S] at low temperature. In contrast, at or near physiological temperature, bound GDP is rapidly released (and degraded), resulting in unligated G proteins to which GTP[S] will bind independently of agonist-activated receptors.","['Institut fur Pharmakologie Universitat GH Essen, Federal Republic of Germany.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the chick embryo, we confirm that mim-1 is specifically expressed during granulopoiesis and we show that the expression of c-myb and mim-1 are perfectly correlated in the granulocytic spleen and pancreas. However we suggest that mim-1 is efficiently transcribed in the absence of c-myb in the yolk sac and in the promyelocytes at the onset of the colonization of the bursa of Fabricius. On the other hand c-myb transcripts detected in the early hemopoietic progenitor cells, in lymphoid cells and in proliferative epithelia are never associated with mim-1 transcription. We conclude that the granulocyte-specific mim-1 gene is regulated by c-myb-dependent and c-myb-independent mechanisms depending upon the environment in which granulocytic precursor cells differentiate.","['INSERM U186/CNRS URA1160, Institut Pasteur, Lille, France.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Thirty cases, including polymorphic, clear cell and lymphoblastic lymphomas, were examined by PAP immunohistochemical method and were all shown to be of T-cell type. Owing to the bizarre appearance of the tumor cells, varied histological architecture and diverse modes of invasion they were often misdiagnosed as anaplastic or poorly differentiated carcinoma. Malignant granuloma was also one of the diagnostic problems because of the ulcer formation. Occasionally, as the tumor base was infiltrated by large amount of inflammatory cells, they could also be misdiagnosed as inflammatory lesions.

Increasing the culture media concentration of [3H]arachidonic acid from 1 x 10(-8) M to 1 x 10(-5) M caused a greater percentage of the cellular tritium to be distributed into triacylglycerols (from less than 1% at 1 x 10(-8) M to 38% at 1 x 10(-5) M) with a corresponding decrease in cellular [3H]diradylglycerophosphoethanolamine (from 53% at 1 x 10(-8) M to 12% at 1 x 10(-5) M) during 2 h incubations. A greater proportion of the tritium present in diradylglycerophosphoethanolamine and diradylglycerophosphocholine, at the higher media concentration of [3H]arachidonic acid (1 x 10(-5) M), was found in the diacyl subclasses of these two lipids than was observed at the lower concentrations (less than 1 x 10(-6) M) of [3H]arachidonic acid. Significant amounts of diarachidonoyl molecular species were found in the phosphatidylethanolamine (10%) and phosphatidylcholine (15%) of HL-60 cells that were labeled for 2 h with 1 x 10(-5) M [3H]arachidonic acid. This was the only molecular species of phosphatidylcholine to completely disappear when prelabeled cells were placed in arachidonate-free media for 22 h. Prelabeling-chase experiments with 1 x 10(-5) M [3H]arachidonic acid were consistent with movement of [3H]arachidonate from triacylglycerols into diradylglycerophosphatides and from diacylphospholipids into ether-linked phospholipids. Increasing the concentration of HL-60 cells in the incubations influenced the distribution of [3H]arachidonic acid in cellular lipid classes in a manner analogous to decreasing the concentration of [3H]arachidonic acid in the media. Increasing the endogenous level of cellular arachidonate in phospholipid classes with supplements of unlabeled arachidonic acid changed the subsequent lipid class distribution of a low concentration (1 x 10(-8) M) of [3H]arachidonic acid to resemble results obtained with a much higher mass level of [3H]arachidonate in arachidonate depleted cells. HL-60 cells differentiated into granulocytes by treatment with dimethyl sulfoxide incorporated less [3H]arachidonic acid but had a greater proportion associated with alkylacylglycerophosphocholine and alk-1-enylacylglycerophosphoethanolamine than undifferentiated HL-60 cells.","['Oak Ridge Associated Universities, Medical Sciences Division, TN.']",['35495-04A1-02/PHS HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Five of these lipophilic compounds [2-(3-ethylureido)-pyridine (1), 2-(3-ethylureido)-6-methylpyridine (4), 2,6-bis-(3-ethylureido)-pyridine (7), 2-(3-ethylureido)-5-methylpyridine (14) and 2-(3-ethylureido)-4,5-dimethylpyridine (15)], promoted terminal erythroid maturation of murine erythroleukemia cells (MEL) (95% hemoglobin producing cells) and stimulated hemoglobin synthesis at concentrations as low as 0.075-0.5 mM. These concentrations are 50-70 fold lower than the optimum inducing concentration of hexamethylene bisacetamide (HMBA), a potent known inducer of differentiation. The proportion of cells induced by each ureido derivative of pyridine was concentration-dependent. Moderate inhibition of cell growth was obtained by these agents at optimum inducing concentrations. Agent 1 also stimulated hemoglobin synthesis in 18% of human erythroleukemia K-562 cells and promoted granulocytic differentiation in 24% of human promyelocytic leukemia HL-60 cells. Structure-activity relationships indicate that 7 was the most potent inducer of all UDPs which contain an ethylureido group attached at 2 position of the pyridine ring as a major structural feature needed for inducing activity. These findings indicate that the ureido derivatives of pyridine are a new class of inducers of murine erythroleukemia cells and, to a lesser extent of granulocytic differentiation, of leukemic HL-60 cells in vitro.","['Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, School of Health Sciences, Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, Greece.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These include enhanced biological stability relative to all-phosphodiester molecules, increased activity in directing ribonuclease H mediated destruction of target RNA, increased specificity and reduced non-specific toxicity. However, another important parameter, the ability of these molecules to enter intact mammalian cells, has not previously been investigated. Therefore, oligodeoxynucleotides were tagged at their 5'-termini with fluorescein reporter groups and a detailed study of uptake kinetics in human leukaemia MOLT-4 cells undertaken by calibrated flow cytometry. Baseline measurements with all-phosphodiester and all-methylphosphonate molecules confirmed that uptake of oligodeoxynucleotides by intact cells is a highly inefficient process. The kinetic data were in agreement with previous reports of mechanisms of cell uptake involving receptor mediated endocytosis in the case of phosphodiester molecules and simple diffusion for methylphosphonates. Chimeric oligodeoxynucleotides exhibited saturable cell uptake kinetics similar to all-phosphodiester oligodeoxynucleotides, suggesting that uptake was receptor-mediated and distinct from concentration-dependent uptake of all-methylphosphonate molecules. Similarly, chimeric molecules were apparently confined to the endosomal compartment within cells. These results imply that reversible masking of the negative charges of the phosphodiester sections of chimeric oligodeoxynucleotides may be required to change the uptake mechanism back to simple diffusion and allow intracellular delivery to the site of the target RNA.","['Department of Biochemistry, University of Liverpool, UK.']",,,,,['c-myc'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The tumor was biphenotypic for immunoglobulin (Ig) expression with surface Ig lambda-positive chronic lymphocytic leukemia and surface and cytoplasmic Ig kappa-positive diffuse large cell lymphoma. DNA samples prepared from areas of the lymph node rich in chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells and diffuse large cell lymphoma cells were examined in parallel. Identical Ig heavy chain gene rearrangements were detected in the BamHI and EcoRI digests of the two samples, but the patterns of rearrangement were different in the HindIII and PstI digests. Because it is very unlikely that multiple rearranged Ig heavy chain gene fragments of identical size would be found in more than one enzyme digest from two independently derived B-cell clones, it is probable that the two processes originated from a single clone. Modifications after rearrangement probably accounted for the differing band sizes seen in the HindIII and PstI digests. These conclusions are supported by cytogenetic analysis, which revealed two clones with a common primary abnormality (trisomy 12), one of which also exhibited secondary abnormalities. Therefore, Richter's syndrome may represent a composite tumor of common clonal origin, even when differences in light chain expression are identified.","['Department of Pathology and Microbiology, University of Nebraska Medical Center, Omaha 68193-3135.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A relatively high incidence of ras mutation was found in M5 AML (40%). No ras mutations were found in other hematological disorders, such as acute lymphoblastic leukemia and chronic myelogenous-leukemia. The most frequent amino acid substitution was that of an aspartate for glycine at codon 12 of N-ras resulting from G to A mutation (11/35).

We report the development of acute T-cell lymphoblastic leukemia in a child following successful treatment of a paravertebral embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma (ERS). Southern blot analysis of DNA extracted from the T-cell lymphoblasts, using probes homologous to loci on the short arm of chromosome 11; P-calcitonin, P40.1 and H-ras, did not demonstrate the chromosomal loss of heterozygosity (LOH), a common feature of embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma. The data presented support the assumption that de novo leukemia emerged following treatment of the primary malignancy.","['Department of Pediatric-Hematology/Oncology, Beilinson Medical Center, Petah Tikva, Israel.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The relationship between the level of differentiation of ANLL cells as determined by their antigen phenotype and the clinical outcome of treatment, including complete remission (CR) rate, survival, and event-free survival, was evaluated. Most leukemic specimens were determined to express the CD33 antigen (L4F3), a 67-kD protein. Because the level of differentiation of normal myeloid cells is reflected by the concentration of the CD33 antigen expressed, samples were categorized as CD33-bright (immature) versus CD33-dull (mature). Patients with CD33-bright leukemic blasts had a marginally inferior CR rate to those with CD33-dull blasts (P = 0.08). With respect to survival and event-free survival, there was a significantly inferior outcome in the CD33-bright patients (P = 0.04 and P = 0.06, respectively). Reactions of ANLL with anti-CD15 antibody (1G10), anti-CD36 antibody (5F1), or anti-CD17 antibody (T5A7) did not predict clinical outcome.

Testing approximately 1,000 human serum samples for HIV antibody by DIA and EIA revealed a total agreement of 98.1%, a specificity of 99.0%, and a sensitivity of 95.9%. For 804 serum samples tested (200 were tested independently in two laboratories), eight results were discrepant: four DIA negatives which were EIA borderline positive and four DIA positives which were EIA negative. Testing the eight discrepant sera by immunofluorescence assay and WB resulted in their being either negative or indeterminate. The four DIA positives were indeterminate by WB. Close agreement was obtained when the remaining sera were compared by DIA, EIA, and WB. Of interest was finding that the DIA results compared favorably with those obtained by WB.

Also analyzed were the hyperthermia as well as radiation responses of multidrug resistant (HL60/AR) and drug sensitive subclones of the HL60 AML cell line. Notably, the drug resistant subclones of CEM and HL60 were as sensitive to hyperthermia as were the drug sensitive subclones. Importantly, no thermotolerant plateau was observed in the hyperthermia survival curves of the drug resistant subclones, indicating that drug/multidrug resistance is not associated with a greater likelihood of thermal tolerance development during hyperthermia. Similarly, the drug resistant CEM and HL60 subclones were not more radiation resistant than the drug sensitive subclones. Thus, the classical or atypical forms of multidrug resistance or methotrexate resistance of the analyzed leukemic cell lines were not associated with radiation resistance. Furthermore, the radiation survival curves of the drug resistant subclones lacked a distinct initial shoulder and their n values were not greater than those of the drug sensitive subclones, suggesting that multidrug resistance is not associated with an increased ability to repair or accumulate sublethal radiation damage. Our findings provide evidence that there is no apparent association between drug/multidrug resistance and heat or radiation sensitivity of CEM T-lineage ALL or HL60 AML leukemia cells. The results of this study indicate that acquired resistance to methotrexate, vinblastine, vincristine, etoposide, actinomycin-D, adriamycin, or daunomycin, or pleiotropic multidrug resistance do not necessarily confer radiation resistance for human leukemic cells.","['Department of Therapeutic Radiology-Radiation Oncology, University of Minnesota Health Sciences Center, Minneapolis.']","['R01 CA-42633/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R29 CA 42111/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Maximum induction was achieved when lymphocytes were incubated at 37 degrees for 60 min in the presence of medullasin (20 micrograms/ml). The cytotoxicity of AK cells induced by medullasin treatment (200 micrograms/ml, 37 degrees for 60 min) was greater than that of lymphokine-activated killer (LAK) cells produced by 500 U/ml of interleukin-2 (IL-2).

The different SE activate all T cells expressing a given V beta, and, therefore, have been termed 'superantigens'. Here we show that SE are potent activators of leukaemic B cells from patients with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL). Purified B cells from seven of eight CLL patients with high WBC counts (greater than 80,000/microliters) responded to one or several of the tested SE (SEA, SEB, SEC1, SED, SEE) by proliferation ([3H]TdR incorporation) and/or Ig secretion. In several instances, the response of leukaemic B cells to SE was much stronger than was the response to other known B-cell activators including EBV, pokeweed mitogen (PWM), phorbolester (TPA), and Staphylococcus aureus Cowan I (SAC). The activation of leukaemic B cells by SE was strictly dependent on the addition of irradiated T cells isolated from healthy donors. FACS analysis of cultured cells ensured that the proliferating cells were indeed B cells. Taken together, these results demonstrate that SE are strong T-cell-dependent B-cell activators that, in some cases, can stimulate maturation of leukaemic B cells which are refractory to other activation signals.","['Institut fur Immunologie, Universitat Heidelberg, Germany.']",,,,,,,PMC1384734,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Another question is which of several alternative treatments is most appropriate. If the patient at risk can be identified early more aggressive and appropriate adjuvant chemotherapy can be initiated to insure remission or longer periods of disease free survival. In this review the role of tissue and/or serum enzyme activities in this regard is considered. Enzymes alone or in combination with tumor markers or other factors may be used. Lactic dehydrogenase (LDH) is perhaps the most common clinical enzyme used in cancer patients for prognostic purposes. It has an important role in germ cell tumors and in association with chorionic gonadotropin and can predict response to therapy and the prospects of remission. LDH is a valuable prognostic marker in lymphoma, leukemia and in colon cancer. Patients can be stratified into treatment protocols based on LDH activity. The stage of cellular proliferation can be evaluated by assay of thymidine kinase in the serum of patients with Hodgkins Disease and in Lymphoma. An important new marker, Cathepsin D in breast tissue may be useful in predicting women with breast cancer who are at risk for early recurrence.","['Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, Department of Clinical Chemistry, New York, NY.']",,,,20,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Treatment of acute myocardial infarction by intracoronary perfusion of thrombolytic enzymes can improve both cardiac function and long-term survival if given early enough. Successful reperfusion can be identified by changes in the kinetics of serum enzyme release and clearance, especially for the isoenzymes and isoforms of creatine kinase.

The donor-recipient matching included: four transplants disparate at one HLA locus (three from unrelated donors and one from a related donor), one transplant disparate at two HLA loci, and one transplant from a one haplotype-mismatched donor. All patients were MLC reactive with their donors. Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis consisted of in vitro T cell depletion with a monoclonal antibody directed against CD3, and complement in conjunction with cyclosporin A begun on day -1. Conditioning included busulfan, cytosine arabinoside, cyclophosphamide, methyl-prednisolone, and hyperfractionated total body irradiation. All patients engrafted, with median time to neutrophils greater than 500 x 10(6)/l and platelets greater than 25 x 10(9)/l of 20 and 21 days, respectively. Acute GVHD was less than or equal to grade II in all patients. Two patients died of infection (Candida, CMV) at days 74, 157. One patient relapsed at day 177, and subsequently died on day 939. Three patients are alive and disease free at 180 +, 1610 + and 2400 + days from BMT.

HL60 and Raji cells were mixed with a 20-fold excess of normal marrow cells and were incubated either with DOX (0.4-3.2 micrograms/ml) for 1 h or AZ (20-140 micrograms/ml) for 30 min or both drugs sequentially. Cytotoxicity was evaluated on tumor cells and GM-CFU by clonogenic assays and on earlier hemopoietic progenitors by liquid long-term marrow cultures (LTMC) for 5 weeks. DOX at 3.2 micrograms/ml and AZ at 140 micrograms/ml spared 1.08 and 1.23% of GM-CFU respectively, and yielded similar tumor cell log-kills for HL60 cells (3.04 and 2.95) and Raji cells (3.24 and 3.40). With the combination of AZ and DOX, the best therapeutic index was observed when the cells were incubated with AZ prior to DOX. Under these conditions, AZ at 80 micrograms/ml together with DOX at 1.6 micrograms/ml significantly increased log-kill values for HL60 cells to 3.96 by a synergistic effect and for Raji cells to 3.85 by an additive effect. In LTMC, GM-CFU recovery after treatment with AZ alone and with the combination of AZ and DOX was 59.9 and 20.0%, respectively, while it was 7.9 and 2.9% at culture initiation. These results suggest that the purging efficiency of DOX is comparable to that of AZ and may be enhanced by combination with AZ.","[""Service d'Hematologie, Hopital Bretonneau, Tours, France.""]",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Acute administration of 1.5-3.5 g of ethanol/kg body weight significantly reduced survival of rats injected with CRNK-16 leukemia cells in a dose-related manner. Acute administration of 2.5-3.5 g of ethanol/kg body weight, one hour before tumor inoculation, or chronic consumption of liquid diet containing ethanol for two weeks before and three weeks after tumor inoculation, significantly increased the number of lung metastases of MADB106 mammary adenocarcinoma. The ethanol-induced increase in the number of metastases was not correlated with plasma levels of corticosterone and was not altered by the opiate antagonist naltrexone. Incubation of spleen cells in vitro in the presence of ethanol, at concentrations comparable to those measured in the blood of ethanol-treated rats, significantly suppressed natural killer (NK) cell activity against MADB106 cells in a standard chromium-release assay and decreased the binding of effector to MADB106 tumor cells. However, neither acute nor chronic ethanol administration in vivo altered splenic NK activity against this tumor in the same in vitro assay, in which the ethanol would have been washed away. These results suggest that, in the presence of ethanol, tumor progression is facilitated. The possibility that this facilitation is related to ethanol-induced impairment of the normal tumoricidal interaction between NK and tumor cells is discussed.","['Department of Psychology, Hebrew University of Jerusalem, Israel.']","['AA 06744/AA/NIAAA NIH HHS/United States', 'NS07628/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Subsequently, the F-SFFV integrates near the Spi-1 gene and activates its expression, resulting in immortalized cells that represent a second stage in the disease process. We report here that media conditioned by erythroleukemia cell lines or leukemic spleen cells induced by the polycythemia-inducing strain of F-SFFV (F-SFFVp), but not medium conditioned by SFFVp-induced hyperplastic spleens, promote the proliferation of normal granulocyte-macrophage progenitor cells and of granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF)- and/or interleukin-3 (IL-3)-dependent cell lines. The colony-stimulating activity of the conditioned media from four of five of the lines studied was neutralized by antibodies specific for IL-3 and/or GM-CSF, and IL-3 and GM-CSF-specific mRNA could be detected in the cells after amplification by the polymerase chain reaction. No rearrangements of the IL-3 or GM-CSF genes were observed by Southern blot analysis. However, as previously shown for SFFV-induced cell lines, the Spi-1 gene was expressed in all of these cells. Because the Spi-1 gene encodes a transcription factor whose cognate sequences are present in the promoter region of many hematopoietic growth factor genes, including IL-3 and GM-CSF, Spi-1 activation may be inducing the expression of these genes.","['Laboratory of Hematopoietic Growth Factors, Lindsley F.

The t(1;19)(q23;p13) was a common feature (23%) in cases with the i(9q), i(7q), i(6p), or i(1q). These findings establish the i(9q), i(17q), and i(7q) as nonrandom chromosomal abnormalities in ALL.

In hematologic malignancies, alterations in the p53 gene have been shown in some human leukemias and lymphomas. Although mutations in the p53 gene are infrequent in acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) patients, we show in this report that alterations in the p53 gene are frequent in myeloid leukemia cell lines. We studied alterations of the p53 gene in nine human myeloid leukemia cell lines by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) analysis, and direct sequencing. Expression of the p53 gene was not detected at all by RT-PCR in two of the nine cell lines. In these two cell lines, Southern blot analysis showed gross rearrangements and deletions in both of the p53 alleles. Six of the nine cell lines were found to express only mutant p53 mRNA by RT-PCR/SSCP analysis and direct sequencing, and wild-type p53 mRNA was not detected. Two of the mutant p53 mRNAs were shown to be products of abnormal splicing events induced by intronic point mutations. Taken together, eight of nine human myeloid leukemia cell lines expressed no or an undetectable amount of wild-type p53 mRNA. Three of the eight cell lines were growth factor-dependent. Our results suggest that inactivation of the p53 gene may be a common feature in myeloid leukemia cell lines and may play an important role in the establishment of these cell lines.","['Third Department of Internal Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, University of Tokyo, Japan.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Because results seemed independent of GM-CSF schedule, we compared results in these 56 patients with results in 176 patients with newly diagnosed AML given the same dose and schedule of ara-C without GM-CSF (110 patients ara-C alone, 66 patients ara-C + amsacrine or mitoxantrone). Comparison involved fitting a logistic regression model predicting probability of complete remission (CR) and a Cox regression model to predict survival (most patients in all three studies were dead) with treatment included as a covariate in both analyses. After adjusting for other prognostically significant covariates [presence of an antecedent hematologic disorder, an Inv (16), t(8;21), or abnormalities of chromosomes 5 and/or 7, performance status, age, bilirubin], treatment with ara-C + daunorubicin + GM-CSF was predictive of both a lower CR rate and a lower survival probability. There were no treatment-covariate interactions, suggesting that the negative effect of this GM-CSF treatment regime was not an artifact of some imbalance in patient characteristics. The unadjusted Kaplan-Meier hazard rate of the ara-C + daunorubicin + GM-CSF group was not uniquely high during the initial 4 weeks after start of therapy, but was highest among the three treatment groups throughout weeks 5 to 16, suggesting that the negative effect of this treatment was not caused by acute toxicity. Patients who did not enter CR with this treatment tended to have persistent leukemia rather than prolonged marrow aplasia, suggesting that this treatment and, in particular, GM-CSF may increase resistance of myeloid leukemia cells to chemotherapy. To date, relapse rates are similar in all three groups (P = .43) (as are survival rates once patients are in CR) but much of the remission duration data is heavily censored, unlike the survival data. Our results suggest caution in the use of GM-CSF to sensitize myeloid leukemia cells to daunorubicin + ara-C chemotherapy.","['Department of Hematology, University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston 77030.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Twelve consecutive patients with de novo acute myeloid leukemia received myeloablative therapy followed by infusion of autologous marrow previously treated in vitro with anti-MY9 and complement. Anti-MY9 and complement treatment eliminated virtually all committed myeloid progenitors (colony-forming unit granulocyte-macrophage) from the autografts. Nevertheless, in the absence of early relapse of leukemia, all patients showed durable trilineage engraftment. The median interval post bone marrow transplantation (BMT) required to achieve an absolute neutrophil count greater than 500/microL was 43 days (range, 16 to 75), to achieve a platelet count greater than 20,000/microL without transfusion was 92 days (range, 35 to 679), and to achieve red blood cell transfusion independence was 105 days (range, 37 to 670). At the time of BM harvest, 10 patients were in second remission, one patient was in first remission, and one patient was in third remission. Eight patients relapsed 3 to 18 months after BMT. Four patients transplanted in second remission remain disease-free 34+, 37+, 52+, and 57+ months after BMT. There was no treatment-related mortality. Early engraftment was significantly delayed in patients receiving CD33-purged autografts compared with concurrently treated patients receiving CD9/CD10-purged autografts for acute lymphoblastic leukemia or patients receiving CD6-purged allografts from HLA-compatible sibling donors. In contrast, both groups of autograft patients required a significantly longer time to achieve neutrophil counts greater than 500/microL and greater than 1,000/microL than did patients receiving normal allogeneic marrow. CD33(+)-committed myeloid progenitor cells thus appear to play an important role in the early phase of hematopoietic reconstitution after BMT. However, our results also show that human marrow depleted of CD33+ cells can sustain durable engraftment after myeloablative therapy, and provide further evidence that the CD33 antigen is absent from the human pluripotent hematopoietic stem cell.","['Division of Tumor Immunology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA 02115.']",['CA 34183/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The Fc gamma R constellation was capable of identifying patients with better or worse prognosis within groups that were homogeneous regarding some other known prognostic factors. Fc gamma R constellation as a prognostic factor was shown to be independent of age, sex, and Rai and Binet stages, but it was found to be connected with the total tumor mass score (TTM).

No excess of stomach cancer was found among farmers in the two countries, which is in agreement with the most recent data from other surveys. The risk of oesophageal cancer was reduced among the Danish and increased among the Italian male farmers. This can probably be explained by differences in alcohol consumption between the Danish and Italian farmers compared with the general population. The risk of brain cancer was significantly reduced among Italian farmers. There was a significant risk reduction for Hodgkin's disease and no excess for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma in Denmark, whereas in Italy a statistically significant excess risk was found for the first and a slight excess risk for the second of these diseases. The per capita consumption of phenoxy-herbicides between 1950 and 1970 was lower in Italy than in Denmark but treatments were performed mainly by professional applicators in Denmark and by the farmers themselves in Italy. Risk of leukaemia among Italian female farmers was increased. In Denmark, this increase was limited to women who were themselves owners of a farm.

Abelson murine leukemia virus (A-MuLV)-transformed pre-B cells express N-myc, whereas mature B cells do not. To determine whether human B-lymphocyte precursors also have increased N-myc expression, we extracted DNA and RNA from representative cell lines, prepared Southern and Northern blots and examined them with the N-myc probe, pNB-1. RNA from the following B-cell developmental stages were examined. One null, 1 pre-pre-B, 3 pre-B (including pre-B-lymphoblastic leukemia, a poor prognostic category) and 5 mature B. Neuroblastoma cells and tissues served as positive controls; negative controls included human muscle, placenta, epithelial cell lines, monocytic, promyelocytic, and T-cell lines. N-myc expression was detected in neuroblastoma cells, but in none of the mature human B or B-lymphocyte precursor cells. Additional immunocytochemical studies performed for N-myc nuclear protein likewise failed to detect this gene product. We conclude that human pre-B cells, unlike murine B-cell precursors, do not express increased levels of N-myc RNA.

The entry of the retrovirus has been determined from the expression of this transduced reporter gene after its integration into the infected cells. This allows the detection of a very low level of viral infection and hence entry of the virus. Exposure of the virus-cell mixture to acidic pH (less than 6) during the early phase of interaction reduces the level of internalization. Cellular infection in presence of weak bases, ammonium chloride and amantadine and an ionophore monensin at concentrations sufficient to neutralize the endosomal pH does not modify the extent of viral entry into the cells.

Pretreatment with hydroquinone (HQ) at concentrations ranging from picomolar to micromolar for 30 min resulted in a 1.5- to 4.6-fold enhancement in colonies formed in response to rGM-CSF that was due to an increase in granulocyte/macrophage colonies. The synergism equaled or exceeded that reported for the effects of interleukin 1, interleukin 3, or interleukin 6 with GM-CSF. Optimal enhancement was obtained with 1 microM HQ and was largely independent of the concentration of rGM-CSF. Pretreatment with other authentic benzene metabolites, phenol and catechol, and the putative metabolite trans, trans-muconaldehyde did not enhance growth factor response. Coadministration of phenol and HQ did not enhance the maximal rGM-CSF response obtained with HQ alone but shifted the optimal concentration to 100 pM. Synergism between HQ and rGM-CSF was observed with nonadherent bone marrow cells and lineage-depleted bone marrow cells, suggesting an intrinsic effect on recruitment of myeloid progenitor cells not normally responsive to rGM-CSF.

Whereas the two growth factor-independent cell lines K562 and U937 grew aggressively and induced leukemia in these animals, three other myeloid cell lines which require interleukin 3 or granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor for continuous growth in vitro failed to induce disease. Primary bone marrow and peripheral blood cells from five out of seven patients with different types of myeloid leukemias (undifferentiated, megakaryoblastic, monoblastic and chronic myelogenous leukemia in blast crisis) induced patterns of leukemic infiltration that were distinct for each leukemia subtype. The diagnosis of leukemia in SCID mice was established by microscopic detection of myeloblasts in the bone marrow, peripheral blood and, in some instances, in extramedullary sites, including the central nervous system and gonads. The karyotype and phenotype of the blasts recovered from mouse tissues were identical to those of the original patient cells. Moreover, human specific ALU sequences were amplified from the bone marrow DNA by polymerase chain reaction. Despite their ability to grow in vivo by serial transfers in SCID mice, the leukemic cells recovered from mouse tissues could not be maintained in vitro, even in the presence of recombinant cytokines. Overall, these data indicate that the SCID mouse may represent a useful animal model for human myeloid leukemias and for the development of new pharmacological and molecular approaches to therapy.","['Wistar Institute of Anatomy and Biology, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.']","['CA42232/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA47589/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have developed an in vitro system to characterize the mechanism by which Tax interacts with the host cell transcription machinery.

Addition of these Tax preparations to nuclear extracts from uninfected human T lymphocytes activated transcription of the HTLV-I long terminal repeat approximately 10-fold. Transcription-stimulatory activity copurified with the immunoreactive 40-kDa Tax polypeptide on gel filtration chromatography, and, as expected, the effect of recombinant Tax was diminished in HTLV-I-infected T-lymphocyte extracts containing endogenous Tax. Tax-mediated transactivation in vivo has been previously shown to require 21-bp-repeat Tax-responsive elements (TxREs) in the promoter DNA. Stimulation of transcription in vitro was also strongly dependent on these sequences. To investigate the mechanism of Tax transactivation, cellular proteins that bind the 21-bp-repeat TxREs were prepared by DNA affinity chromatography. Recombinant Tax markedly increased the formation of a specific host protein-DNA complex detected in an electrophoretic mobility shift assay. These data suggest that Tax activates transcription through a direct interaction with cellular proteins that bind to the 21-bp-repeat TxREs.","['Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, University of Colorado, Boulder 80309-0215.']",,,,,,,PMC364369,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The Y1 receptor-specific agonist (Leu-31,Pro-34)-NPY is 4-fold more potent and the carboxyl-terminal fragment NPY13-36 is 150-fold less potent than NPY. Thus, it is concluded that the response is mediated through the activation of a Y1 type of NPY receptor. HEL cells do not respond to a second addition of NPY but do respond to a further addition of alpha-thrombin (alpha-T). However, in a calcium-free medium, prior stimulation with NPY largely inhibits a subsequent response to alpha-T. Moreover, prior stimulation with alpha-T in the absence of external calcium completely prevents the response to the addition of NPY, indicating a common effector pathway. The latter is further reinforced by using thapsigargin (TG), which has been shown to deplete the Inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate-dependent calcium pool in other systems. HEL cells preincubated with TG in calcium-free medium fail to respond to either NPY or alpha-T. Likewise, prior stimulation with NPY or alpha-T in calcium-free medium significantly inhibits the response to TG. Preincubation of cells with phorbol esters strongly inhibits the NPY-induced release of intracellular Ca2+ in HEL cells, an effect that is partially prevented by preincubation of the cells with H7, a protein kinase C inhibitor. However, neither the homologous nor the apparent heterologous desensitization of the NPY receptor can be prevented by H7. It is concluded that NPY releases intracellular Ca2+ from an inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate-sensitive calcium pool, which is restored by external calcium, and that NPY receptor desensitization is protein kinase C independent.","['Division of Pharmacology, Wellcome Research Laboratories, Research Triangle Park, North Carolina 27709.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here we provide an overview of relevant aspects of retinoid physiology and molecular biology, review preclinical studies indicating antitumor activity for retinoids, and summarize the current status of clinical investigations of retinoid use for the treatment of adult and pediatric tumors. DESIGN: The published literature was reviewed with attention to areas of retinoid research that would shed insight into the oncologic uses of retinoids. RESULTS: Retinoids play critical roles during normal fetal development and induce differentiation (and/or growth inhibition) in a variety of tumor-cell lines. Retinoid effects seem to result from changes in gene expression mediated via specific nuclear receptors (termed retinoic acid receptors, RAR-alpha, -beta, and -gamma), and a specific chromosomal translocation involving the RAR-alpha gene occurs in APL patients. In addition to the very high clinical response rate for RA in patients with APL, significant clinical responses have been observed for patients with cutaneous T-cell malignancies, juvenile chronic myelogenous leukemia, and dermatologic malignancies. Additionally, the combination of 13-cis-retinoic acid (cRA) with interferon alpha (IFN alpha) has produced high objective response rates for patients with squamous cell carcinomas of the head and neck and of the cervix. CONCLUSIONS: The antitumor activity demonstrated for retinoids (especially RA) alone and in combination with other agents supports the need for targeted phase II trials to define the spectrum of responsive tumors and for laboratory studies to further delineate the biologic mechanisms associated with therapeutic responses. High priority should then be given to phase III trials to delineate optimal strategies for improving outcome by combining retinoid-based treatments with conventional chemotherapy and radiotherapy regimens.","['Pediatric Section, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, MD 20892.']",,,,369,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To clarify the relative contribution of cranial irradiation (CRT) therapy and drug therapy to these outcomes, we evaluated neuropsychologic outcomes associated with different doses of CRT and intravenous (IV) methotrexate (MTX) in long-term survivors. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Fifty-one patients treated for ALL on Dana-Farber Cancer Institute protocol 81-01 were evaluated by standardized cognitive and academic achievement tests. These children had been assigned at diagnosis to a standard-risk (SR) or high-risk (HR) group and received 1,800 cGy or 2,800 cGy CRT, respectively. A subgroup of these patients was randomized to receive MTX during remission induction, either as a single low dose (LD; 40 mg/m2) or a single high dose (HD; 4 g/m2) with leucovorin rescue. RESULTS: Sex and MTX randomization jointly predicted the intelligence quotient (IQ). Fifty percent of girls versus 14% of boys exhibited low IQ (less than 90; P = .01); 80% of girls who received HD MTX versus 25% of girls who received LD MTX exhibited low IQ (P = .03). In contrast, risk group better predicted performance on tasks sensitive to verbal memory and/or coding. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that (1) significant neurotoxicity occurred principally in girls; (2) increased dose intensity of IV MTX was associated with lower IQ, but only in girls; and (3) increased dose of CRT may have been associated with impairment of verbal memory and coding.","[""Department of Radiation Oncology, Children's Hospital, Boston, MA 02115.""]","['CA19789/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'NS22108/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States', 'P30-HD18655/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We retrospectively evaluated the effect of various risk factors observed at diagnosis and at transplantation on survival, event-free survival (EFS), and relapse after BMT. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Seventy-nine patients with CML in chronic phase (CP) were treated with cyclophosphamide and total body irradiation followed by BMT. Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis consisted of cyclosporine (CsA) in most instances or CsA plus the use of lymphocyte-depleted bone marrow (BM). RESULTS: Survival at 4.5 years was 52%. Stratified by age and GVHD prophylaxis, the actuarial survival was 65% (95% confidence interval [CI], 47% to 78%) in patients aged less than 30 years receiving unmanipulated BM, 33% (95% CI, 12% to 56%) in patients greater than or equal to 30 years old receiving unmanipulated BM, and 38% (95% CI, 14% to 63%) in patients greater than or equal to 30 years old receiving lymphocyte-depleted BM. In univariate analysis, patient age (greater than or equal to 30 years) and the use of lymphocyte-depleted BM negatively influenced EFS. When stratified by age and GVHD prophylaxis, however, ABO incompatibility, cytomegalovirus (CMV) seropositivity, and chronic GVHD significantly reduced the probability of EFS. Factors that have been associated with early death in nontransplanted patients (ie, sex, spleen size, blast and platelet counts at presentation) were not predictive of long-term survival outcome after BMT. CONCLUSIONS: The data suggest that (1) BMT should be offered early after diagnosis to all patients with CML in CP who have compatible sibling donors regardless of prognostic factors at presentation, (2) GVHD remains the principal cause of mortality after BMT in patients receiving CsA, and (3) T-cell depletion by the physical separation method of counterflow elutriation (CE) is associated with a significant risk of relapse.","['Bone Marrow Transplantation Unit, Johns Hopkins Oncology Center, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD.']",['P01-CA15396-16/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Sixty patients with advanced phases of Philadelphia chromosome (Ph)-positive CML received combination therapy with IFN-A 5 x 10(6) U/m2 daily, and low-dose ara-C 15 mg/m2 daily for 2 weeks every 4 weeks until remission, then for 1 week every month as maintenance. Forty patients were in late chronic-phase CML, and 20 were in accelerated-phase CML (16 with clonal evolution only, four with other criteria). Their outcome was compared with 58 patients (39 late chronic-phase CML and 19 accelerated-phase CML) who had been previously treated with IFN-A alone in the same dose schedule. RESULTS: In late chronic-phase CML, patients receiving IFN-A plus ara-C had a better complete hematologic response (CHR) rate compared with those treated with IFN-A alone (55% v 28%; P = .02), a trend for better Ph suppression (15% v 5%; P = .13), and a longer survival (3-year survival rate 75% v 48%; P less than .01). These differences do not seem to be caused by imbalances in prognostic factors between the two treatment groups. In accelerated-phase CML, the addition of ara-C to IFN-A did not improve the response rate of treated patients, and the difference in survival was accounted for by different patient characteristics. Suppression of clonal evolution was observed in five patients (25%). Patients with clonal evolution as the only criterion for disease acceleration had a longer survival than those with other or additional accelerated-phase criteria (3-year survival rate 67% v 22%; P less than .01). CONCLUSION: The results with the combination of IFN-A plus ara-C in late chronic-phase CML are encouraging, and suggest the need for its evaluation in early chronic-phase CML.","['Department of Hematology, M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Ets binding sites have been identified in the transcriptional regulatory regions of multiple T cell genes including the T cell receptor alpha and beta (TCR-alpha and -beta) enhancers and the IL-2 enhancer, as well as in the enhancers of several T cell-trophic viruses including Maloney sarcoma virus, human leukemia virus type 1, and human immunodeficiency virus-2. T cells express multiple members of the Ets gene family including Ets-1, Ets-2, GABP alpha, Elf-1, and Fli-1. The different patterns of expression and protein-protein interactions of these different Ets family members undoubtedly contribute to their ability to specifically regulate distinct sets of T cell genes. However, previous studies have suggested that different Ets family members might also display distinct DNA binding specificities. In this report, we have examined the DNA binding characteristics of two Ets family members, Ets-1 and Elf-1, that are highly expressed in T cells. The results demonstrate that the minimal DNA binding domain of these proteins consists of adjacent basic and putative alpha-helical regions that are conserved in all of the known Ets family members. Both regions are required for DNA binding activity. In vitro binding studies demonstrated that Ets-1 and Elf-1 display distinct DNA binding specificities, and, thereby interact preferentially with different naturally occurring Ets binding sites. A comparison of known Ets binding sites identified three nucleotides at the 3' end of these sequences that control the differential binding of the Ets-1 and Elf-1 proteins. These results are consistent with a model in which different Ets family members regulate the expression of different T cell genes by binding preferentially to purine-rich sequences that share a GGA core motif, but contain distinct flanking sequences.","['Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Ann Arbor, Michigan.']",['AI-29673/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,PMC2119210,['J Exp Med 1993 Sep 1;178(3):1133'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Using a human erythroleukemic cell line (HEL), we investigated whether p21ras is involved in erythropoietin signal transduction. We found that stimulation of HEL cells with erythropoietin induces a 5-fold increase in the amount of GTP bound to the endogenous p21ras. This effect is dose-dependent and occurs very rapidly. We also observed that erythropoietin causes tyrosine phosphorylation of several proteins in a time-dependent manner that correlates with the p21ras activation. Moreover, inhibition of tyrosine kinases by genistein totally prevents the erythropoietin-induced accumulation of a p21ras.GTP complex. By using an antiserum against the GTPase-activating protein, we found that p120GAP is rapidly phosphorylated in tyrosine in response to erythropoietin. Furthermore, the ability of a lysate from erythropoietin-stimulated HEL cells to induce in vitro hydrolysis of GTP bound to p21ras was strongly reduced. These results demonstrate that activation of p21ras is an early event in the erythropoietin signal transduction pathway, and they suggest that accumulation of the p21ras.GTP complex may be triggered by inhibition of GTPase-activating protein activity.","['Division of Cell Biology, Burroughs Wellcome Co., Research Triangle Park, North Carolina 27709.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The induction by TPA was immediate-early (within 30 min) and transient. This gene was not induced by vitamin D3 or by retinoic acid, which stimulates differentiation of HL-60 cells to the monocytic or granulocytic lineage, respectively. The ETR103 mRNA was induced by TPA in lymphoid or myeloid leukemia cell lines of several maturation stages. The induction by TPA seems to proceed by a protein kinase C-mediated mechanism, on the basis of the results obtained by using protein kinase C inhibitor (H-7), protein kinase C activator (diC8), and an activator of protein kinase A (dibutyryl cAMP). Okadaic acid, an inhibitor of protein phosphatases, also induced the ETR103 mRNA expression. The nucleotide sequence of the ETR103 cDNA reveals that ETR103 encodes a human zinc finger-containing transcription factor identical to Egr-1 and 225, which is homologous to mouse Egr-1, Zif/268, Krox-24, and TIS8, or to rat NGFI-A.","['Life Science Group, Faculty of Integrated Arts and Sciences, Hiroshima University.']",,,,,,,,,"['GENBANK/D13975', 'GENBANK/D13976', 'GENBANK/L01141', 'GENBANK/M62829', 'GENBANK/S96732', 'GENBANK/S96733', 'GENBANK/S96735', 'GENBANK/S96741', 'GENBANK/S96751', 'GENBANK/S96754']",,,,,,,,,,,,

When the cells were induced by dimethylsulfoxide, dibutyryl cAMP, or nicotinamide to differentiate into granulocytes, these two PKC isoforms each increased to about 2- to 3-fold. When retinoic acid was used as the inducer, in addition to PKC alpha and beta, a third PKC isoform appeared. This isoform was clearly distinct from rat PKC alpha, beta, and gamma, immunologically. This isoform showed a distinctly lower Ca(2+)-requirement (3 microM) than that of PKC alpha or beta (100 microM) and was more dependent on cardiolipin and phosphatidylethanolamine, compared with PKC alpha, beta, and gamma.

The clinical significance of this mechanism is as yet unclear. In 83 children with untreated acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), we determined the prognostic value of HGPRT activity and the relation between HGPRT activity and resistance to thiopurines. HGPRT activity was determined radiochemically; in vitro resistance to 6-TG with the MTT assay. HGPRT level was significantly lower in T-ALL than in B-lineage ALL; no differences were found between sequential differentiation stages of B-lineage ALL. HGPRT activity was inversely related to the white-blood-cell count (WBC). Among patients with cALL and pre-B-ALL with WBC less than 50 x 10(9)/l, cases with a low HGPRT had a significantly poorer prognosis than those with a high HGPRT. WBC, age, sex, organomegaly and differentiation stage were comparable in both patient groups. No correlation was found between HGPRT activity and in vitro 6-TG resistance in cALL and pre-B-ALL patients. T-ALL cases were not more 6-TG-resistant than cALL and pre-B-ALL cases. Cells from 6 relapsed ALL cases did not show decreased HGPRT activity. We conclude that: (a) HGPRT is lower in T- than in B-lineage ALL and is constant in sequential differentiation stages of B-lineage ALL; (b) HGPRT activity is inversely related to tumor load; (c) low HGPRT activities are correlated with a poorer prognosis in precursor B-ALL but this cannot be explained by thiopurine resistance because (d) there is no relation between HGPRT activity and in vitro 6-TG resistance.","['Department of Pediatrics, Free University Hospital, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Bright nucleolar fluorescence was observed in control promyelocytic growing cells. The addition of RA in the culture system resulted in time- and dose-dependent induction of differentiation, cell growth inhibition, and nucleophosmin translocation from nucleoli to nucleoplasm. Unlike the control cells, many fewer nucleophosmin-associated preribosomal ribonucleoprotein particles (pre-rRNPs) could be obtained from nucleoli of RA-treated cells. Addition of sphinganine, an inhibitor of protein kinase C, facilitated the RA-induced differentiation, nucleophosmin translocation, and cell growth inhibition. Cells treated with sphinganine were more responsive to RA. Differentiation, translocation of nucleophosmin, and inhibition of cell growth occurred with lesser doses of RA or in shorter incubation times in the presence of sphinganine. Significant numbers of HL-60 cells could be rescued from the effects of RA upon the removal of RA after 2-h drug exposure. Pretreatment but not posttreatment of HL-60 cells with sphinganine, however, modulated the reversibility of the effects induced by short-exposure RA treatment. These results indicated that RA therapy can be improved by the pretreatment or the concurrent use of a modulator of protein kinase C activity.

This cell line was characterized by morphology, immunophenotype, Giemsa-banding pattern, in vitro proliferation capacity, and tumorigenicity in nude mice. The KBM-3 cell line was established in the presence of exogenous lymphokines (human placenta-conditioned medium, HPCM), but medium for later passages did not contain HPCM. We found high cellular expression of the mRNA message for granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), which we suggest may be important for the immortalization of the cell line. KBM-3 cells have an immature myelomonocytic phenotype. Cytogenetic analysis revealed a pseudodiploid karyotype with five characteristic marker chromosomes and ranging in total number from 45 to 49. In suspension cultures, the cells had a doubling time of 23 h and a cloning efficiency of about 30% in soft agar independent of exogenous lymphokines. Two-thirds of nude mice injected with 1 x 10(4) KBM-3 cells and all animals injected with 1 x 10(5) cells developed S.C. granulocytic sarcomas within 6-8 weeks. These tumors were locally invasive but did not give rise to distant metastases. When transplanted to a new set of nude mice, all tumors formed secondary sarcomas at the site of implant.

It, therefore, was the aim of the present study to investigate in a group of patients with acute nonlymphoblastic leukemia (ANLL; n = 19) and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL; n = 19) in complete remission the effect of mafosfamide at the level of adherent blast colony-forming units (blast colony-forming units, CFU-Blast), as well as multipotential (granulocyte erythrocyte macrophage megakaryocyte colony-forming units, CFU-GEMM), erythroid (erythroid burst-forming units, BFU-E), and granulocyte-macrophage (granulocyte-macrophage colony-forming units, CFU-GM) progenitor cells. When nonadherent marrow mononuclear cells (MNCs) were incubated (30 min, 37 degrees C) with increasing doses of mafosfamide (30-120 micrograms/ml), a statistically significant (p less than or equal to 0.0005) dose-dependent suppression of CFU-Blast growth was observed. The mean (+/- 1 standard error of the mean [SEM]) values of 50% inhibition (ID50) of the CFU-Blast growth were not significantly different for ANLL (106 +/- 5) and ALL (107 +/- 5) patients. Analysis of CFU-Blast ID50 distribution demonstrated that ID50 ranged from 100 to 120 micrograms/ml in 17 cases (45%), whereas it ranged from 60 to 100 micrograms/ml in 12 cases and from 120 to 160 micrograms/ml in 9 cases. A statistically significant (p less than or equal to 0.05), dose-dependent suppression of colony growth from multi-potential and lineage-restricted progenitor cells was also observed. However, the value of CFU-Blast ID50 was significantly higher (p less than or equal to 0.05) than CFU-GEMM, BFU-E, and CFU-GM ID50 and ID95 values. In conclusion, our data demonstrate that: 1) the CFU-Blast assay allows to detect on an individual basis the doses of mafosfamide used for marrow purging, and 2) the concentrations of mafosfamide extrapolated by using the CFU-Blast assay are significantly higher than those obtained with the CFU-GM assay. The absence of any detrimental effect on marrow engraftment in vivo supports the safety of the CFU-Blast assay to evaluate the dose of mafosfamide used for marrow purging before ABMT.","['Department of Hematology, University of Parma, Italy.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The effects of staurosporine, a selective inhibitor of PKC, and the tumor promoter, 12-O-tetradecanoyl phorbol-13-acetate, an activator of PKC, on Friend cell proliferation and differentiation were examined. Neither the inhibitor nor the activator of PKC affected proliferation at 96 h as measured by [3H]thymidine incorporation, but both compounds inhibited cell differentiation. In addition, nuclear PKC activity was highest in untreated and in tumor promoter-treated cells that were not differentiated, and it was lowest in cells induced to differentiate with hexamethylene bisacetamide or dimethylsulfoxide. It is concluded that nuclear PKC activity is essential for Friend erythroleukemia cell proliferation, and that a decrease in enzyme activity within the nucleus is associated with differentiation.","['Tulane University School of Medicine, Department of Pharmacology, New Orleans, LA 70112.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

When cisplatin was incubated in a French commercial formulation of 5-FU (Fluoro-uracile, Roche, France), high-performance liquid chromatographic (HPLC) studies demonstrated a rapid disappearance of the parent platinum compound, the extent of the degradation being 75% after 3.5 h. These studies also revealed that the degradation was not caused by a reaction between 5-FU and cisplatin but rather resulted from an interaction between cisplatin and trometamol, the excipient used in the French 5-FU formulation to buffer the solution at pH 8.2. The sole presence of trometamol in a cisplatin solution for 24 h at 30 degrees C resulted in the complete inhibition of both the ability of cisplatin to bind in vitro to human serum albumin and the antitumor activity of the cytostatic agent against P388 leukemia in mice (T/C% = 88% for cisplatin+trometamol vs greater than 333% for cisplatin). When cisplatin was incubated at the same pH in trometamol-free sodium hydroxide solutions (the excipient used in 5-FU formulations in several countries, including the United States and the United Kingdom), the parent compound was transformed into reactive species that were toxic to mice (T/C% = 40% in P388 leukemia). The degradation determined for a carboplatin-trometamol admixture using HPLC was similar to that found for cisplatin but occurred at a slower rate (0 after 3.5 h incubation and 55% after 24 h). The antitumor activity of carboplatin in P388-bearing mice was not significantly altered by a 24-h period of preincubation in the presence of trometamol (T/C% = 209% vs 241% for treatment with carboplatin in the absence of trometamol). As in the case of cisplatin, incubation of carboplatin for 24 h in a sodium hydroxide solution resulted in a toxic effect (T/C% = 64%).

The accumulation of transcripts for gp91-phox and p47-phox, as quantitated at the single-cell level by in situ hybridization, is extremely heterogeneous; however, when the cells are stimulated by IFN-gamma and TNF together, most or all the cells in the induced cultures express higher accumulation of gp91-phox and p47-phox transcripts than cells from uninduced culture. In situ hybridization was performed on cellular subsets separated by fluorescence-activated cell sorting on the basis of surface expression of differentiation antigens or respiratory burst activity.

The alpha-, beta-, and omega-interferon (IFNA, IFNB1, and IFNW, respectively) and the methylthioadenosine phosphorylase (MTAP) genes have been mapped to the short arm of chromosome 9, band p22. Homozygous deletions of these genes have been reported in many leukemia- and glioma-derived cell lines. In this report, we present a detailed analysis of partial and complete homozygous or hemizygous deletions of DNA sequences on 9p in human cell lines and primary tumor samples of glioma patients. Ten of 15 (67%) glioma-derived cell lines had hemizygous or homozygous deletion of IFN genes or rearrangement of sequences around these genes, while 13 of 35 (37%) primary glioma tumor samples had hemizygous (8 tumors) or homozygous (5 tumors) deletion of the IFN genes. The shortest region of overlap of these deletions maps in the interval between the centromeric end of the IFN gene cluster and the MTAP gene. In the cell lines and primary tumors examined, these gross genomic alterations were seen only in association with high grade or recurrent gliomas. Our observations confirm that loss of DNA sequences on 9p, particularly the IFN genes, occurs at a significant frequency in gliomas, and may represent an important step in the progression of these tumors. These results are consistent with a model of tumorigenesis in which the development or progression of cancer involves the loss or inactivation of a gene or several genes that normally act to suppress tumorigenesis. One such gene may be located on 9p; this gene may be closely linked to the IFN genes. Nevertheless, loss of the IFN genes, when it occurs, may play an additional role in the progression of these tumors.","['Department of Medicine, University of Chicago, Illinois 60637.']","['CA42557/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA49133/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA50905/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Mice were given injections of either 10(5) cells or 10(6) cells by either the i.v. or the i.p. routes. Leukemia-bearing mice were treated with either i.v. or i.p. injections of free drug, i.v. or i.p. injections of liposome-entrapped drug, or 24-h i.v. infusions of free drug. Long-circulating liposomes contained, as the stealth component, either monosialoganglioside or polyethylene glycol-distearoylphosphatidylethanolamine. Liposomes lacking the stealth components (non-stealth liposomes) were also injected for comparison. At lower dose ranges, stealth liposomes were superior to non-stealth liposomes in prolonging mean survival times of the mice, and all liposome preparations were superior to injections of the free drug. Drug entrapped in stealth liposomes, when administered at or near the maximum tolerated dose of 100 mg/kg ara-C were considerably superior to 24-h free drug infusions given at the same total drug dose. Therapeutic effect was related to the half-life of leakage of ara-C from the liposome formulations, as well as to circulation half-life, with maximum therapeutic effect achieved with long circulation half-lives and more rapid leakage rates. The therapeutic efficacy of non-stealth liposomes increased with increasing liposome (and drug) dose as a result of saturation of liposome uptake by the mononuclear phagocyte system, which resulted in longer circulation half-lives for these liposomes at higher doses (Michaelis-Menten pharmacokinetics). Liposome entrapment can protect rapidly degraded drugs from breakdown in vivo, with release of the drugs in a therapeutically active form over periods of up to several days. The dose-independent pharmacokinetics and reduced mononuclear phagocyte system uptake of stealth liposomes gives them distinct advantages over non-stealth liposomes.","['Department of Pharmacology, University of Alberta, Edmonton, Canada.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Moderate to high levels of hsp60 mRNA and protein could be induced in the THP-I monocytic leukemia cell line by heat shock, retinoic acid, interferon (IFN)-gamma or tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha treatment, the highest levels obtained with a combination of IFN-gamma/TNF-alpha.

The mainstay of treatment is medical therapy, surgery being reserved for patients with haemoptysis. Resection of focal sites of infection has not been routinely considered in view of the high morbidity and mortality reported from the surgery of aspergillomas in past series. After the death of two neutropenic patients from massive haemoptysis following IPA in 1986, we have resected localised pulmonary aspergillus lesions in 16 patients following IPA. Five patients had haemoptysis. The most common procedure performed was a lobectomy. All patients were granulocytopenic and excessive post-operative bleeding occurred in three patients, one of whom required a re-thoracotomy as a result. There was one post-operative death due to cytomegalovirus pneumonia. Surgery was otherwise uneventful. There were no recurrent pulmonary aspergillus infections on follow-up and three patients proceeded to bone marrow transplantation. The success of surgical resection encourages an aggressive policy in the management of IPA to prevent life-threatening haemoptysis and to allow patients to proceed with further chemotherapy and bone marrow transplantation.","['University Department of Surgery, Royal Free Hospital, London, UK.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

CPE-C potently inhibited cell growth and decreased clonogenic capacity at concentrations achieved in murine and primate pharmacologic studies. CPE-C produced a concentration-dependent depletion of CTP, accompanied by changes in the dCTP pools. CPE-C exposure was associated with an accumulation of cells in the S phase at 48 hr. [3H]CPE-C was metabolized predominantly to the triphosphate (CPE-CTP) form. Saturation of phosphorylation to the monophosphate form occurred above 5-10 microM. Plateau CPE-CTP pools were of a magnitude similar to that of the physiologic ribonucleotide triphosphate pools. The intracellular half-life of CPE-CTP was 24 hr. After a 24-hr exposure to 0.5 microM CPE-C, CPE-CTP was detected for up to 96 hr post-drug removal, accompanied by persistent depletion of the CTP pools. Cesium sulfate density centrifugation of purified nucleic acids indicated that [3H]CPE-C incorporated into RNA, but was not detected in DNA. Agarose-gel electrophoresis of RNA from [3H]CPE-C-treated cells indicated that it localized predominantly in low molecular weight (4-8 S) RNA species. When CPE-C was administered concurrently with [3H]adenosine (Ado), the proportion of [3H]Ado migrating with low molecular weight RNA species increased. Concurrent exposure to 10 microM cytidine (Cyd), sufficient to replete CTP pools, provided essentially complete protection against lethality resulting from a 24-hr exposure to less than or equal to 0.5 microM CPE-C. While 10 microM Cyd substantially decreased CPE-CTP formation and CPE-C-RNA incorporation during the initial 3 hr of exposure compared to CPE-C alone, after 24 hr the levels were not significantly different. Cyd rescue did not affect the accumulation of [3H]CPE-C or [3H]Ado into low molecular weight RNA species after a 24-hr exposure to CPE-C. Our results indicate that depletion of CTP and dCTP pools is an important component of CPE-C cytotoxicity. While CPE-C incorporation into RNA may not be the critical cytotoxic event during a 24-hr exposure to CPE-C, it may play a role during prolonged exposure to CPE-C. CPE-C is a highly potent new agent and merits clinical evaluation in the treatment of colorectal cancer.","['Medicine Branch, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, MD 20892.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Since the cells during 1 day of differentiation were morphologically the same as uninduced cells, the results suggest the importance of these enzymes in more cellular proteolysis for the following committed differentiation. While cathepsin D was present mostly in the sedimentable fraction of cells throughout the differentiation period, the distribution of cathepsin E varied to the stage of differentiation. The ratio of the soluble/sedimentable cathepsin E content was 1.1, 1.4, 0.9, and 0.7 in cells after 0, 1, 4, and 7 days of DMSO treatment, respectively. The maturation of reticulocytes to erythrocytes was accompanied by complete loss of the soluble cathepsin E and of all of the cellular cathepsin D. Immunoblotting analyses revealed that both uninduced and induced cells contained two forms of cathepsin E; a high molecular weight form (82 kDa) which was mainly associated with the sedimentable fraction and a low molecular weight form (74 kDa) which was found largely in the soluble fraction. The distribution of these two forms was not significantly changed throughout the differentiation period, but the 74-kDa protein was completely eliminated with maturation of reticulocytes to erythrocytes. Cathepsin D also appeared in two forms in both uninduced and induced cells; a minor (46 kDa) and a major (42 kDa) form which appear to have a precursor-product relationship.","['Department of Pharmacology, Nagasaki University School of Dentistry, Japan.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this report we now extend the assessment of TGF-beta 1's antitumor potential by evaluation in vivo versus the mouse monomyelocytic leukemia, Wehi 3BD+, and the human lung adenocarcinoma, A549. In culture both Wehi 3BD+ and A549 cells, sampled from in vivo, were sensitive to inhibition (greater than or equal to 50%) by TGF-beta 1 (greater than or equal to 1 ng/ml) in a 6 day proliferation assay. Despite their sensitivity to TGF-beta 1 in culture, in vivo the growth of neither tumor was reproducibly altered following treatment with various doses, routes and schedules of TGF-beta 1. For example, the median lifespan of mice inoculated with Wehi 3BD+ cells (10(3) or 10(5) cells, ip) was not increased by TGF-beta 1, given as 9 daily ip injections or 7 days of continuous ip infusion. Dose levels in these studies ranged over greater than 2 logs and were escalated to include those frankly lethal (28 micrograms/mouse by injection or 7 micrograms/mouse/day by infusion). Furthermore, the growth of A549 tumors implanted sc in athymic mice was not inhibited by iv injection (every 3 days for 5 injections or 6 consecutive daily injections), sc treatment distal to the tumor (every 3 days for 5 injections or continuously infused for 14 days), or even sc injection adjacent to the tumor (every 3 days for 5 injections), although dose levels of TGF-beta 1 covered a wide range including those which produced lethalities. On the basis of cumulative dose, continuous infusion of TGF-beta 1 by both ip and sc routes was more toxic than frequent injections given by the same routes. These studies indicate lethality is reached without a meaningful tumor inhibition being produced following ip, sc, or iv injections, and sc or ip infusions of TGF-beta 1.","['Bristol-Myers Squibb Co., Wallingford, CT 06492.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Based on the proposed growth expression and the calculation of progenitor cell presence in blood, a similar pattern of growth, in which f = 0.5, became apparent for AML progenitors in two cases of relapsing AML. The presence of leukemic progenitors in blood was quantified by adopting an indirect approach. The estimated fs compared closely with 3H-thymidine indexes previously obtained (literature data) for leukemic blasts and their progenitors. It is considered that the pattern of proliferation that maintains f = 0.5 may characterize the mode of cell growth that pertains in stages of advancing leukemia.

By use of the log-log plot, the growth of breast cancer risk was found to be quasi-exponential, and the above time range was termed the stage of exponential growth. 2) From 47.5 years of age on, the stage of stagnation ensued: the ASIR for the United Kingdom kept on rising with a much reduced inclination, whereas that for Japan followed the way of gradual decline. In the log-log plot, the junction between the 2 stages was recognized as a distinct break point. 3) A similar two-stage structure was found in the ASIR profiles of cancers of the stomach, lung, cervix uteri, and corpus uteri. The break points for the first 2 neoplasias were located at senescent ages, and those for cervical cancer and endometrial cancer were located at the pre- and peri-menopausal ages respectively (27.5-32.5 and 52.5 years).

The United States per capita generation and residential consumption of electric power have grown roughly exponentially since 1900; total per capita generation has increased by a factor of 10 since 1940, and per capita residential consumption has increased by a factor of 20 in the same period. The ubiquitous stray fields from power distribution lines and internal and external wiring in buildings have grown in the same proportions. In contrast to the explosive increase in the generation and use of electricity, the age-adjusted cancer death rate for the population as a whole shows only a slight rise since 1900. When respiratory cancers (largely caused by tobacco use) are subtracted, the remaining death rate has actually fallen since 1940. That the death rate may have fallen because of better diagnosis and treatment, despite a rising incidence rate, is not substantiated, especially for leukemia, including childhood leukemia, where the incidence rate has been constant or declining slightly for the past 25 yr. The absence of any appreciable change in the national cancer incidence rates during a period in which residential use of electric power has increased dramatically shows that the associated stray 50- or 60-Hz electromagnetic fields pose no significant hazard to the average individual.","['Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory, Berkeley, CA.']",,,,,,,PMC48897,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To evaluate the feasibility of somatic gene therapy for the treatment of these disorders, retroviral-mediated gene transfer was used to introduce the full-length ASM cDNA into cultured fibroblasts from two unrelated type A NPD patients. The ASM activities in these cells were less than 4% of mean normal levels, and, consequently, they accumulated approximately 3-fold elevated levels of sphingomyelin. After retroviral-mediated transfer of the ASM cDNA, ASM activities in the NPD cells increased to levels up to 16-fold those found in normal fibroblasts. In addition, the sphingomyelin content was reduced to normal levels, indicating that the vector-encoded enzyme was properly targeted to lysosomes, where it was enzymatically active and able to degrade the accumulated substrate. In situ cell-loading studies also were undertaken to evaluate the effects of retroviral-mediated gene transfer on the pathology of NPD fibroblasts. When a pyrene derivative of sphingomyelin was introduced into the lysosomes of cultured fibroblasts from a type A NPD patient by using apolipoprotein E-mediated endocytosis, only approximately 6% of the delivered substrate was degraded. In contrast, normal cells and NPD cells transduced (i.e., ""corrected"") by retroviral-mediated gene transfer could degrade approximately 80% of the delivered sphingomyelin. These results provided further evidence that retroviral-mediated gene transfer may be used to correct the pathology of NPD cells. Cell-loading studies were also used to develop a selection system for discriminating between NPD cells and those transduced by retroviral-mediated gene transfer. This selection scheme was based on the fluorescence emission of intact NPD cells, which, when loaded with pyrene-labeled sphingomyelin, was 3- to 5-fold that of normal or transduced cells. As a consequence, the NPD and transduced cells could be efficiently sorted by flow cytometry with a fluorescence-activated cell sorter. In addition, the NPD cells could be selectively killed by photosensitization after irradiation with a long-wavelength UV light. These results should permit direct selection of ASM-expressing cells after retroviral-mediated gene transfer without the need to preselect for a cotransferred marker gene.","['Division of Medical and Molecular Genetics, Mount Sinai School of Medicine, New York, NY 10029.']","['1 R01 HD28607/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States', '5 M01 RR0071/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,PMC48839,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

F(ab')2-like antibody-enzyme fusions were prepared by linking the gene for human angiogenin to a chimeric anti-transferrin receptor heavy chain gene. The antibody-enzyme fusion gene was introduced into a transfectoma that secretes the chimeric light chain of the same antibody, and cell lines were cloned that synthesize and secrete the antibody-enzyme fusion protein of the expected size at a concentration of 1-5 ng/ml. Culture supernatants from clones secreting the fusion protein caused inhibition of growth and protein synthesis of K562 cells that express the human transferrin receptor but not toward a non-human-derived cell line that lacks this receptor. Whereas excess antibody to the same receptor did not itself inhibit protein synthesis, it was able to completely prevent the protein synthesis inhibition caused by the fusion protein. These results indicate that the cytotoxicity is due to a transferrin receptor-mediated mechanism involving the angiogenin portion of the fusion protein and demonstrate the feasibility of constructing recombinant antibody-RNase molecules capable of killing tumor cells bearing the transferrin receptor. The significance of the acquired cytotoxicity of a mouse/human chimeric antibody linked to a human protein may bear importantly in human therapeutic strategies that use mouse antibodies linked to toxins from plants or bacteria to target tumor cells.

When inoculated into mice this retrovirus induced plasmacytomas in up to 100% of infected mice and less frequently induced pre-B lymphomas. Both tumor types contained genome-length proviruses in one or a few chromosomal locations, were mono- or oligoclonal as judged by immunoglobulin gene rearrangement and had unrearranged endogenous c-myc loci. The type of tumor induced depended upon the age and strain of mouse, and whether helper virus was present in the inoculated virus pool. ABL-MYC induced plasmacytomas with or without helper virus, with or without pretreatment of the mice with pristane, and in strains of mice resistant to pristane-induced plasmacytomas. Pristane treatment prior to ABL-MYC infection shortened the latent period of plasmacytomagenesis and produced mostly IgM-secreting tumors rather than IgA-secreting tumors, which predominantly arose in the absence of pristane. Control viruses for ABL-MYC with either a deletion in v-abl or a frameshift mutation in c-myc caused predominantly monocyte/macrophage tumors and pre-B-cell lymphomas respectively. Histopathological analysis of ABL-MYC-infected mice showed foci of transformed plasma cells as early as 14 days after infection. These results indicate that v-abl and c-myc act synergistically to transform mature B cells with high efficiency.","['McArdle Laboratory for Cancer Research, University of Wisconsin, Madison 53706.']","['CA 41302/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32-CA09135/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,"['c-myc', 'v-abl']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here we also demonstrate expression of SCL mRNA in normal mast cells, mast cell lines and megakaryocytic cell lines. SCL is therefore expressed in the same three lineages as GATA-1, a well-recognized hemopoietic transcription factor. SCL and GATA-1 mRNA were also co-expressed in interleukin 3-dependent primitive myeloid lines. In murine erythroleukemia (MEL) cells SCL and GATA-1 underwent coordinated biphasic modulation during hexamethylene bisacetamide (HMBA)-induced erythroid differentiation. The kinetics of SCL and GATA-1 mRNA expression was inversely correlated with changes in ID, a negative regulator of B-HLH proteins, and was distinct from changes in MYC, MYB and erythropoietin receptor transcripts. During myeloid differentiation of K562 cells, SCL and GATA-1 mRNA levels also underwent biphasic modulation. Thus SCL and GATA-1 are coordinately expressed in multiple hemopoietic lineages and coordinately regulated during induced erythroid and myeloid differentiation. In nonhemopoietic tissues SCL was only detected in adult and developing brain where GATA-1 is reportedly not expressed. In day 14.5 embryos analysed by in situ hybridization, SCL transcripts were detected in post-mitotic neurons in the metencephalon and roof of the mesencephalon. This suggests a previously unexpected role for SCL in neural differentiation.","['Department of Haematology, Cambridge, UK.']",,,,,"['GATA-1', 'SCL']",,,['Oncogene 1992 Jul;7(7):1459'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

A correction reported here to the vav sequence reveals that a central domain of some 230 amino acids is similar to the products of three genes: the human dbl oncogene, now known to encode a GDP-GTP exchange factor for the Ras-like polypeptide CDC42Hs; the CDC24 gene of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, which participates with CDC42Sc in organization of the cytoskeleton for budding; and the human bcr gene, which recombines with the abl oncogene in certain forms of leukemia. Furthermore, the N-terminal portion of Vav (and of CDC24) is similar to that of certain proteins that associate with filamentous structures. These similarities suggest that Vav, and perhaps also Bcr, may function as a GDP-GTP exchange factor for a Ras-like molecule such as CDC42Hs, and that its action may coordinate cytoplasmic architecture with the cell cycle. Reported evidence that the vav proto-oncogene is widely expressed in hematopoietic cells but not other cell types is extended here by detection of vav mRNA in 49 of 50 murine hematopoietic cell lines representing diverse hematopoietic lineages, and by in situ hybridization in embryos showing expression confined to the only hematopoietic tissue, fetal liver. Thus, like Dbl in other cell types, Vav may function throughout the hematopoietic compartment to govern a Ras-like signal transduction pathway.","['Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, Royal Melbourne Hospital, Victoria, Australia.']",['CA12421/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The stimulation of erythroid progenitors also resulted in a reduction in red blood cell (RBC) transfusion requirements: the number of RBC units delivered in the first 30 days following BMT decreased from 8.1 in the controls to 4.0, while the total number of RBC units before transfusion independence was about threefold lower than in the control. Finally, the time of transfusion dependence was significantly shortened by rhEpo. No clinically significant adverse effect directly attributable to rhEpo was recorded. These data suggest that the administration of rhEpo may be beneficial in hastening erythroid engraftment, and possibly in reducing RBC transfusion requirements following BMT.","['Department of Hematology, Careggi Hospital Florence, Italy.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In ten patients with hairy cell leukemia (HCL) and seven patients with other B-cell chronic leukemias (BCL), we have studied the intracellular 2',5'-oligoadenylate synthetase (2,5OAS) activity of the mononuclear cells before, 4 h, 24 h, and 48 h after pentostatin administration. In patients with HCL the median level of intracellular 2,5OAS increased 4.6-fold at 4 h and 11.5-fold at 24 h compared to the pretreatment value. Among the other seven patients, the median intracellular 2,5OAS remained unchanged in three patients and rose slightly by 2 to 14 times in four patients. Eleven patients (eight with HCL and two with BCL) responded to pentostatin. The median increase in 2,5OAS among the responders was 13.0-fold (range 4.8-30.0) whereas that among non-responders was 2.2-fold (range 0.2-6.3). The difference was highly significant (p less than 0.0001). In five of the total seventeen patients, the plasma levels of 2,5OAS activity were also determined and changes in plasma levels paralleled those measured intracellularly. To determine if the elevation of 2,5OAS is mediated by induction of interferon alpha, the expressions of mRNA for interferon alpha and beta were investigated by means of reverse transcription and polymerase chain reaction using the corresponding sense primers. In none of the five patients thus studied could we find an induction of mRNA for interferon alpha or beta in the leukemic cells during treatment with pentostatin. Thus, response to pentostatin correlates with induction of 2,5OAS directly and the 2',5'-oligoadenylate system seems to be involved in cytotoxicity.","['Northeastern Ontario Regional Cancer Centre, Sudbury, Canada.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Terminal divisions and self-renewal were assayed by primary (PE1) and secondary (PE2) colony formation, respectively. Thirteen cases of AML, were tested. Melphalan induced a negative exponential dose-effect on CFU-L survival. Moreover, melphalan was equally effective in inhibiting CFU-L growth in both PE1 and PE2 assays, with D10 values of 1.53 +/- 0.17 micrograms/ml and 1.59 +/- 0.21 micrograms/ml for PE1 and PE2, respectively (p = 0.48). Cytotoxicity of melphalan on CFU-L did not differ significantly from that observed for normal hemopoietic granulocyte-macrophage colony-forming units, erythroid burst-forming units, and granulocyte-erythroid-macrophage-megakaryocyte progenitors. Mafosfamide-lysine, a stable cyclophosphamide congener, strongly inhibited primary colony formation (PE1) with a D10 value of 14.46 +/- 1.76 micrograms/ml, but was much less efficient in the PE2 assay. Our findings suggest that the self-renewal capacity of AML progenitors can be differentially affected by alkylating agents. Moreover, since it is now considered that chemotherapy should be preferentially directed against the self-renewal of leukemic progenitors, melphalan might offer a greater potential than cyclophosphamide or cyclophosphamide derivatives in the therapy of AML.","[""Laboratoire d'Hematologie et de Genetique, Centre Regional de Transfusion Sanguine, Toulouse, France.""]",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The enzyme has been the subject of much biochemical investigation yet its function in the hairy cells (HC) is still unknown. Two TRAcPs have been purified from HCL spleen tissues by a series of chromatographic separations. The two enzymes, provisionally called peak 1 and peak 2, had specific activities of greater than 600 U/mg and 800 U/mg respectively when p-nitrophenyl phosphate (p-NPP) was used as substrate and had Km values in the range of 1 to 5 mM p-NPP. The two TRAcPs had the same substrate specificities and inhibitor sensitivities, therefore could be isoforms of the same enzyme. Their pH optima were between 5 and 6 for all substrates tested including the phosphotyrosine-containing peptide, Raytide, which was still hydrolyzed efficiently at neutral pH. Neither phosphoserine nor phosphoserine-containing casein were hydrolyzed by either enzyme. The TRAcPs of HC may thus be capable of functioning as protein-tyrosine phosphatases (PTP). High activity of a PTP could regulate the activities of protein-tyrosine kinases and thereby influence the growth and differentiation of the hairy cells.","['Research Service, Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center, Louisville, KY 40206.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Phosphorylation of p19 occurs when the growth of cells is affected by 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) and it has been proposed that increased phosphorylation of p19 relates to the cessation of cell growth. This study delineates precisely the relationship between p19 phosphorylation changes in the growth and differentiation status of cells. Changes in the levels of two phosphorylated forms of p19 were assessed in HL-60 promyelocytic cells and a variant HL-60 cell line which stopped growing and differentiated in response to TPA and were compared to changes seen in HL-60 variant lines which merely growth arrested when treated with TPA. In lines which either did or did not differentiate, in response to TPA, the p19 protein was rapidly and transiently phosphorylated. Thus, this alteration in the phosphorylation status of p19 is associated with the process of growth arrest and not related to the onset of cell differentiation. The p19 protein and the enzymes which effect its phosphorylation status modulate the growth of cells and possible disregulation of p19 and/or its kinases and phosphatases is of interest as regards the leukaemic transformation of cells.","['Department of Immunology, Medical School, University of Birmingham, U.K.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Mononuclear cells from a normal donor, obtained at post-traumatic splenectomy, served as a control. TNF prolonged the survival of HCL cells obtained from five different HCL patients when compared to cells cultured in control media alone, although cell proliferation could be demonstrated in only two of the five. HCL cells stained negative for the Epstein-Barr nuclear antigen (EBNA) both before and after 4 weeks in culture. BCGF, 5637 CM, and PHA-stimulated lymphocyte CM also prolonged the survival of HC25 and HC56 cells, although not to the same degree as TNF. Cells cultured in BCGF, however, stained positive for EBNA. None of the other recombinantly produced or purified cytokines prolonged the survival of the leukemic cells. With the exception of IL-2, none of the growth factors studied prolonged the survival of purified normal spleen (NS) cells over a 4-week period of time when compared to NS cells incubated in media alone. TNF prolonged the survival of HC25 cells in a dose-dependent manner, and a highly purified antibody to TNF abrogated the effects of TNF. HC25 cells incubated in the presence of control media alone did not constitutively produce TNF mRNA; however, incubation of the cells in the presence of TNF for 48 h induced the cells to express TNF message. We conclude that TNF is important in prolonging the survival of HCL cells, and thus may be important in the pathogenesis of this disease.","['William S.

Five patients had cerebral palsy, 1 esophageal atresia, 1 Fanconi's anemia, and 5 were otherwise normal children. Six were treated medically. Eight patients underwent Nissen fundoplication for complications of gastroesophageal reflux (GER). Five patients were available for follow-up endoscopy (mean, 2 years; range, 1.1 to 5.4 years). Endoscopy was performed on a yearly basis, obtaining biopsy specimens from multiple levels of the esophagus. Four children had satisfactory clinical response to an antireflux procedure including the resolution of a stricture in one case. However, in all 5 cases persistent metaplastic epithelium was documented and showed no evidence of regression. Although there has been speculation that Barrett's esophagus in children may be more likely to revert to normal squamous epithelium than in the adult, there has been only one case of regression in 180 cases of Barrett's esophagus occurring in children described in 37 reports in the literature.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","['Department of Surgery, Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The avian MC29 v-myc gene was introduced into the Rat-1 cell line by retroviral infection using a Moloney murine leukemia recombinant retrovirus. For both cell lines, the introduction of exogenous myc genes resulted in an increased degree of transformation. For the non-tumorigenic Rat-1 cell line, this also resulted in the acquisition of tumorigenicity, while for the Rat-1 (PT) cell line the degree of tumorigenicity was increased.

The induction of NF-kappa B-like activity in murine macrophages by S. aureus was as effective as induction by tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) or lipopolysaccharides (LPS) and was observed in macrophages derived from LPS-sensitive and LPS-resistant mice. Stimulation of macrophages with S. aureus but not with the exotoxins resulted in the accumulation of TNF-alpha in the culture medium. The induction of NF-kappa B-like activity by S. aureus, however, clearly preceded TNF-alpha secretion and was not inhibited by a neutralizing serum against TNF-alpha. In addition, pretreatment of macrophages with the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide or dexamethasone, which prevented the secretion of TNF-alpha from macrophages, did not interfere with the induction of NF-kappa B-like activity by S. aureus. This findings reveal the existence of bacterial components other than LPS which can induce NF-kappa B-like activity in susceptible cells.","['Institute of Biochemistry, University of Freiburg, Germany.']",,,,,,,PMC257108,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These findings were compared with those of 13 cases of intermediate differentiated lymphoma/mantle zone lymphoma (ILL/MZL) and 20 cases of typical small lymphocytic lymphoma/chronic lymphocytic leukemia (SLL/CLL). B-zone SLL was characterized histologically by a deceptively benign pattern at a low magnification, the lymph node architecture being substantially preserved, in contrast to the ILL/MZL and SLL/CLL cases, in which complete effacement of the normal architecture usually could be observed. Moreover, in BZSLL the cellular population was rather uniform and lacked either a prolymphocytic component or the small-cleaved lymphoid cells often seen in SLL/CLL and ILL/MZL cases, respectively. The phenotypic profile of the BZSLL clonal cell population studied by the immunoperoxidase method and by single- and double-labeling flow cytometric analyses (SIg+, CD19+, CD20+, CD21+, CD22+, CD24+, CD35+, CD37+, CD74+, CD45+, CD45R+, MB2+, HLA-DR+, Leu-8+, CD9+/-, CDw75+/-, CD5-/+, CD23-/+, CD10-, FMC7-, PCA-1-, CD25-, CD38-, CD43-, CD3-) appeared to be fairly homogeneous and sufficiently distinct from that of ILL/MZL, based on the absence of FMC7 and CD38 molecules, and from that of SLL/CLL due to significantly stronger expression of SIgs (P less than .05), the higher reactivity with anti-CD9 and -CD22 antibodies (P less than .05), the lower reactivity with anti-CD5 and -CD23 antibodies (P less than .05), and the absence of CD25 determinants. Several clinical features of patients with BZSLL, including age group, advanced stage disease, and high frequency of bone marrow and peripheral blood involvement, were similar to those found in the other patients with ILL/MZL and SLL/CLL, but none of the BZSLL patients had an absolute lymphocyte count higher than 15.0 x 10(9)/L at presentation. Based on the architectural pattern, cytologic features, immunophenotypes, and hematologic findings, we conclude that BZSLL is an unusual variant of SLL that is primary in the lymph nodes and should be distinguished from ILL/MZL and CLL.","['Division of Pathology, Centro Regionale di Riferimento Oncologico, Istituto Nazionale di Ricovero, Aviano, Italy.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Further analysis of partially purified enzyme from Cl-3527 by immunoblotting revealed that the molecular size of the enzyme in Cl-3527 was 108 kDa and that the amount of the mutant enzyme protein was markedly decreased in Cl-3527. The mutant enzyme was much more heat-labile than the wild type enzyme but the Km for NAD+, requirements for Mg2+ and nicked DNA, and the inhibition by 3-aminobenzamide, a potent inhibitor of the enzyme, however, were not so different from those of wild type enzyme. The mutant cells showed prolonged doubling time, increased temperature-sensitivity, increased percentage of active enzyme on a treatment of cells at high temperature, and increased expression of plasma membrane NADase, compared to wild type cells.

Lhermitte's sign appeared 4 to 8 months after BMT and resolved spontaneously after 2 to 5 months. Neurologic sequelae had developed in none of the patients 16 to 34 months after BMT. No unifying etiologic factor could be identified in these patients. The development of Lhermitte's sign after BMT appears to be a benign, self-limited phenomenon that requires no specific treatment.","[""Division of Neurology, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, MA 02115.""]",['K11 CAO1492/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The c-jun cDNA used for the construction of the vector was modified so as to prevent the nonspecific targeting of junB and junD transcripts. High level and rapid induction of c-jun antisense transcripts was achieved with as little as 10(-8) mol/L dexamethasone (DEX) and resulted in a 80% to 90% reduction in c-jun protein levels. The continuous exposure of the transfected cells to DEX inhibited growth by greater than 85% over a 5-day period, whereas DEX had no effect on the growth rate of control F-MEL cells. This proliferative block was associated with a reversible accumulation of cells with a 2n DNA content.

Thus, inhibition of c-jun protein causes logarithmically growing cells to leave the cell cycle and to enter a state closely resembling, if not identical to, G0.

We show here that human myeloid cell lines and bone marrow samples from patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and blast crisis of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) also grow in SCID mice. Human AML or CML cell lines (three of three lines tested) grew in the bone marrow and peripheral blood of the mice after intravenous (IV) inoculation in a pattern closely resembling human AML. To define the best conditions for the growth of primary human myeloid leukemia cells, samples were transplanted into mice at several alternative sites. Using flow cytometry and Southern analysis, mice were analyzed at defined intervals up to 36 weeks after transplantation for the presence of human cells in various tissues. For four of four patients with AML and two of two patients with blast crisis of CML, myeloblasts grew locally at the site of implantation and were detected in the murine hematopoietic tissues. In contrast, marrow implants from patients in the chronic phase of CML (six patients) showed infrequent and limited myeloid growth in the mice. These findings demonstrate that the SCID mouse is a reproducible system for the propagation of blastic human myeloid leukemias. The differential growth of early- versus late-phase CML suggests that the SCID mouse may be a useful assay for identifying biologically aggressive leukemias early in their clinical presentation.","['Department of Medicine, University of California-Los Angeles 90024.']","['CA01551/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA30388/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA53867/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It was found that leukemic cells from two of 37 patients had a complete loss of alpha- and beta-IFN genes, whereas cells from four of 37 had lost one of the alpha-/beta-IFN alleles. In 25 cases, viable cells were also available for functional studies. Cell clones with loss of one of the alpha-/beta-IFN alleles produced low amounts of IFN after virus induction in vitro. Some clones with an apparently normal set of IFN genes were unable to produce detectable amounts of IFN. All clones studied were found to carry high-affinity alpha-IFN receptors. In clones carrying deletions of IFN genes, the cells were sensitive to IFN in vitro as measured by alpha-IFN-induced enhancement of 2',5'-oligoadenylate synthetase (2',5'-A synthetase). Cells from four patients with an apparently normal set of IFN genes were insensitive to this effect of IFN. We conclude that of the 17 patients in which IFN genes, IFN production, alpha-IFN receptors, and IFN-induced enhancement of 2',5'-A synthetase were studied, nine (53%) showed some abnormality in their IFN system. This finding may add some support to the hypothesis that defects in the IFN system could be a step on the path to malignant transformation in ALL. Moreover, patients whose malignant cells carry IFN gene deletions or other defects in their IFN-producing capacity, but are still sensitive to exogenous IFN, could represent a subgroup of ALL with a greater likelihood of responding to IFN therapy.","['Division of Experimental Oncology, Radiumhemmet, Stockholm, Sweden.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this report, using the same detection methods, we confirm the negligible expression of p53 protein in normal light density marrow cells. However, we find clearly significant levels of p53 protein expression in enriched normal human marrow blast populations. Furthermore, using a panel of p53 specific monoclonal antibodies, we find the p53 protein constitutively synthesized by normal marrow blasts has the immunologic phenotype identified by PAb240 that reportedly recognizes a common conformational-dependent epitope on mutant p53. We have also found that the p53 immunologic subclass identified by PAb240 exists in normal human circulating lymphocytes either resting, serum starved, or PHA activated. In summary, it is clear that (1) normal marrow blast populations provide the appropriate control for assessing the levels of p53 protein expression in leukemic blast cells; and (2) PAb240 cannot be used to distinguish p53 mutated at the DNA level from normal p53 in fresh human hematopoietic cells.","['Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, Laboratory of Hematopoietic Cell Kinetics, New York, NY 10021.']","['CA20194/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01CA28704/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",['Blood. 1992 Oct 1;80(7):1857-8.

This novel strategy appeared particularly promising for patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) in blast crisis, since in some cases complete elimination of bcr-abl-expressing cells was accomplished. We have examined 11 additional patients, including seven in chronic phase, in order to extend these initial observations. We sought in particular to determine if elimination of bcr-abl-expressing clones was a usual event. Exposure of CML cells to c-myb antisense oligomers resulted in inhibition of CFU-granulocyte, macrophage (CFU-GM)-derived colony formation in eight of 11 (73%) cases evaluated. Inhibition was antisense sequence-specific, dose-dependent, ranged between 58% and 93%, and was statistically significant (P less than or equal to .03) in seven of the eight cases. In two cases, CFU-granulocyte, erythrocyte, monocyte, megakaryocyte (CFU-GEMM)-derived colony formation was also examined and found to be inhibited by the c-myb antisense oligomers in a sequence-specific manner. To determine whether CML CFU had been reduced or eliminated after exposure to the antisense oligomers, we examined cells in the residual colonies for bcr-abl mRNA expression using a reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction detection technique (RT-PCR). Eight cases were evaluated and in each case where antisense myb inhibited growth, bcr-abl expression as detected by RT-PCR was either greatly decreased or nondetectable. No residual leukemic CFU were demonstrable on replating of treated cells. These results suggest that c-myb antisense oligomers substantially inhibit the growth and survival of CML CFU in both chronic and blast phase of disease. They may therefore prove useful for both ex vivo and in vivo treatment of CML.","['Department of Pathology, University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine, Philadelphia 19104.']","['CA01324/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA36896/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA54384/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,"['abl', 'bcr', 'c-myb']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The mortality rate for maintenance therapy was 0%, consolidation therapy, 21%; and alloBMT, 36%. Consolidation therapy caused an especially high mortality rate in the patients greater than or equal to 60 years old (8 of 14 or 57%). The toxicity of combined high-dose cytarabine and amsacrine is unacceptable, especially in older patients, and alternative approaches to consolidation therapy such as high-dose cytarabine alone need to be tested.

On ATRA, metamorphosis of peripheral blood leukemic promyelocytes to mature neutrophils was observed, despite the persistence of t(15;17) in 100% of bone marrow metaphases. DNA was extracted from fractionated serial blood specimens, collected at diagnosis, in first complete remission (CR), relapse, and during ATRA treatment. Using a phosphoglycerokinase (PGK) probe, the patient was heterozygous for both Bgl I and Bst XI PGK polymorphisms. Methylation analysis showed monoclonal leukemic promyelocytes with a polyclonal first CR achieved by standard chemotherapy. Subsequent examination, in relapse, of granulocytes appearing during ATRA treatment showed these to be monoclonal, proving these were derived from the neoplastic clone. The X-linked clonal analysis methodology has provided in vivo evidence of cellular differentiation as the mechanism of action of ATRA. Parallel studies of cytogenetic and clonal analysis showed a regression of the t(15;17) cytogenetic abnormality and return of a polyclonal PGK methylation pattern in 5 weeks, indicating a repopulation of marrow by normal stem cells. As standard cytogenetic techniques are inappropriate for nondividing cells, X-linked clonal analysis provides a marker system to allow insight into mechanism of drug action in malignant hematologic disease.","['Hematology Department, Mater Misericordiae Hospital, South Brisbane, Queensland, Australia.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Incidence data from the UK national children's tumour registry (CCRG) for 1968-1983 have recently become available for small area analyses by location at diagnosis (OPCS, 1991). Extensive analyses using a variety of methodologies have shown consistent, though weak, evidence of the occurrence of both spatial clustering and space-time interactions. Results from one of these analyses (Alexander, 1991) are now extended to test specific prior hypotheses generated by an independent case-control study (Alexander et. al., 1992). These suggested that transmission of a specific, though unknown, agent (Z) plays some role in the development of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) with the times when children are susceptible to infection differing by age-of-onset and hence subtype of ALL. For cases with older onset (aged 5 years and over) it was suggested that persistent infection may have been established in utero or early infancy and, now, formal testing of appropriate space-time interactions provide indirect confirmation of this (P = 0.0002). More recent exposure to Z may contribute to ALL in the childhood peak years (Alexander et. al., 1992) but the confirmation provided here is less strong (P = 0.05). The results afford new impetus to a search for a transmissible aetiologic agent or agents; these need not be rare and the results should not be interpreted as evidence for direct case to case transmission.","['Leukaemia Research Fund Centre for Clinical Epidemiology, University of Leeds, UK.']",,,,,,,PMC1977570,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The objective was to compare residential histories of cases and controls and in particular to determine whether case children had lived in the same place at the same time more often than controls.

The ability of hypoxanthine (HX) to modulate the effects of two antifolates-ICI 198583 (an inhibitor of thymidylate synthetase) and piritrexim (PTX, a lipophilic inhibitor of DHFR)-was investigated using cultured mouse leukaemic cells, L1210. HX (10(-4) M) was found to potentiate only the cytotoxicity of DHFR inhibitors (MTS and PTX), increasing cell kill by 20-70 fold to the level achieved by an equivalent concentration (10(-5) M) of ICI 198583 alone. Agarose gel electrophoresis of DNA extracted from cells exposed to antifolates for 24 h demonstrated that the chromatin was cleaved into multimers of 200 base pairs. This pattern of DNA cleavage indicates cell death via apoptosis. The degree of DNA fragmentation was found to be closely linked to cytotoxicity. DNA fragmentation increased from 50% in cells treated with 10(-5) M MTX or PTX to 70% when HX was added with the drugs, a level achieved by 10(-5)M ICI 198583 alone. HX potentiation of cytotoxicity was correlated with a substantial increase in dATP in conjunction with low dTTP pools. The specific potentiation of DHFR inhibitors by HX may be due to their inhibition of purine synthesis with a concurrent rise in PRPP levels. Addition of HX with MTX substantially raised intracellular purine levels via the salvage pathway as indicated by ribonucleotide pool measurements. ICI 198583, on the other hand, stimulated de novo purine synthesis with or without added HX. Treatment with MTX plus HX or ICI 198583 (with or without HX) caused a reduction of dTTP pools to 8% of untreated control and excess dATP accumulation. The subsequent elevation (to 300% of control) of the dATP pool may provide a signal for endonucleolytic fragmentation of DNA and subsequent cell death.","['Department of Cancer Medicine, University of Sydney, NSW, Australia.']",,,,,,,PMC1977543,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

P388/ADR cells were partly resistant to porphyrin-catalyzed photodamage to amino acid transport, but this result was not associated with differences in sensitizer localization, as indicated by fluorescence studies.

Amongst these antibodies, UJ13A, 5.1.H11 and ERIC-1 have been shown to recognise the neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM). Expression of the NCAM molecule is highly complex, with several isoforms of the protein resulting from the differential splicing of the NCAM mRNA transcript. Western-blot analysis of Nalm-16 cell extracts indicates that cells express the heavily polysialylated form of the molecule found on many embryonic tumours. Neuraminidase digestion indicates that the 140 kD isoform is predominantly expressed on Nalm-16, although the 120 kD isoform is present to a lesser degree.

The present study investigated the cytotoxicity of LAK cells towards human leukemia cells. LAK cells were generated by culturing peripheral blood mononuclear cells from normal donors for six days in the presence of recombinant interleukin 2 (IL-2). Cytotoxicity was evaluated using a standard 4-h chromium-release assay. A significant lysis of fresh uncultured leukemia cells by IL-2-activated killer cells could be detected in 77 of 150 leukemias examined. The mean Cr-release was 35.7 +/- 12.9% in the LAK cell-sensitive vs 9.9 +/- 5.9% in the resistant leukemias. With a view to the therapeutic utilization of the LAK-cell system, we attempted to improve the efficiency of its cytotoxic mechanisms. Combined application of IL-2 and interferon-alpha, interferon-gamma, or tumor necrosis factor-alpha in cultures for generation of activated killer cells significantly improved the effectiveness of cytotoxic mechanisms. Our results suggest that the performance of adoptive immunotherapy with ex vivo-activated LAK cells and the in vivo induction of cytotoxic immune responses by IL-2 alone or combined with different lymphokines or cytokines may be of value in treating human leukemia, especially when the tumor burden is low, e.g. during maintenance therapy or after bone marrow transplantation to eliminate minimal residual disease or in early relapse.","['Department of Hematology and Oncology, Universitaetsklinikum Steglitz, Free University of Berlin, Germany.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Normal and CML granulocytes were labeled with 32P-sodium orthophosphate and then stimulated with aggregated IgG. The phosphoproteins in the unstimulated and stimulated cells were analyzed by 2D-SDS-PAGE followed by autoradiography. The results show that there are five distinctly identifiable, reproducibly phosphorylated proteins referred to as Pp1-Pp5. In the unstimulated normal cells, Pp1 is less phosphorylated than Pp3, while in CML cells, Pp1 is more intense than Pp3. On stimulation of normal cells, with aggregated IgG, intensity of Pp1 increases while that of Pp3 decreases. In CML cells this response is reversed.

Alternative treatment modalities must therefore be evaluated. This review summarizes the results that have been obtained with low-dose chemotherapy, especially with low-dose cytosine arabinoside (Ara-C). Overall response rates to treatment with low-dose Ara-C are about 40%, with some 20% of patients achieving a complete remission. Transition of MDS to AML does not reduce the probability of response. The therapeutic outcome cannot be reliably predicted by clinical or experimental parameters. Hematological toxicity is substantial, with approximately 10-25% treatment-related deaths. Duration of response is short and rarely exceeds one year. In terms of overall survival, low dose Ara-C does not appear to be superior to supportive care only. Other cytotoxic agents have not been studied in detail, but data available do not suggest an appreciable advantage over Ara-C. Before denying low-dose chemotherapy a helpful role in MDS, randomized studies should concentrate on those patients who can be expected to derive the greatest benefit.

Both encode a 135-kDa gag-myb-ets fusion protein which is localized in the nucleus. We have recently shown that ME26 virus can induce erythropoietin (Epo) responsiveness in hematopoietic cells. Mice infected with ME26 virus develop a hyperplasia of Epo-dependent hematopoietic precursor cells from which permanent cell lines can be established. In vitro, ME26 virus specifically induces Epo responsiveness in the interleukin-3-dependent myeloid cell line FDC-P2 by enhancing expression of the Epo receptor (EpoR). In the present study we demonstrate that ME26 virus infection of FDC-P2 cells also results in enhanced expression of beta-globin and the erythroid-specific transcription factor GATA-1, a protein which can transactivate both the EpoR promoter and globin genes. In addition, these cells exhibit a down-regulation of c-myb expression similar to that seen in differentiating erythroid cells. To determine the molecular basis for activation of erythroid genes in ME26 virus-infected cells, we carried out transient expression assays with DNA constructs of either the EpoR promoter of the GATA-1 promoter linked to reporter genes. Our results indicate that while ME26 virus did not directly enhance expression from the EpoR promoter, both it and its avian parent, E26, transactivated the GATA-1 promoter. Furthermore, ME26 virus cooperates with the GATA-1 protein to enhance expression of the EpoR gene. We propose that the mechanism by which ME26 virus induces erythroleukemia involves transactivation of the GATA-1 gene, thus positively regulating the expression of the EpoR and leading to the proliferation of a unique population of Epo-responsive cells. By specifically inducing Epo responsiveness in hematopoietic cells via transactivation of a transcription factor, ME26 virus utilizes a novel mechanism for retrovirus pathogenesis.","['Laboratory of Molecular Oncology, National Cancer Institute, Frederick, Maryland 21702-1201.']",,,,,['epoR'],,PMC241066,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Unlike viruses in the Friend virus complex, it does not cause erythroleukemia but causes a rapidly progressive hind limb paralysis when injected into newborn rats and mice. We have isolated an infectious DNA clone (clone 3d) of this virus which causes neurological disease in animals as efficiently as parental PVC-211 MuLV. The restriction map of clone 3d is very similar to that of the nonneuropathogenic, erythroleukemogenic Friend murine leukemia virus (F-MuLV), suggesting that PVC-211 MuLV is a variant of F-MuLV and that no major structural alteration was involved in its derivation. Studies with chimeric viruses between PVC-211 MuLV clone 3d and wild-type F-MuLV clone 57 indicate that at least one determinant for neuropathogenicity resides in the 2.1-kb XbaI-ClaI fragment containing the gp70 coding region of PVC-211 MuLV. Compared with nonneuropathogenic ecotropic MuLVs, the env gene of PVC-211 MuLV encodes four unique amino acids in the gp70 protein. Nucleotide sequence analysis also revealed a deletion in the U3 region of the long terminal repeat (LTR) of PVC-211 MuLV clone 3d compared with F-MuLV clone 57. In contrast to the env gene of PVC-211 MuLV, particular sequences within the U3 region of the viral LTR do not appear to be required for neuropathogenicity. However, the changes in the LTR of PVC-211 MuLV may be responsible for the failure of this virus to cause erythroleukemia, because chimeric viruses containing the U3 region of F-MuLV clone 57 were erythroleukemogenic whereas those with the U3 of PVC-211 MuLV clone 3d were not.","['Laboratory of Molecular Oncology, National Cancer Institute, Frederick, Maryland 21702-1201.']",,,,,,,PMC241036,,['GENBANK/M81185'],,,,,,,,,,,,

Gi sub-unit content was increased in IFN-M as measured by pertussis toxin-catalyzed ADP-ribosylation and immunoblotting with antibodies against alpha i2 and alpha i3 G protein subunits. Guanosine 5'-[gamma-thio]triphosphate equilibrium binding demonstrated an increased number of G proteins coupled to formyl peptide receptors on IFN-M. We conclude that IFN-gamma increases expression of both formyl peptide receptors and G proteins coupled to these receptors, thereby enhancing FMLP-stimulated transmembrane signaling. Regulation of transmembrane signaling element expression may be a significant mechanism by which IFN-gamma regulates cellular functions.","['Department of Medicine, University of Louisville Health Sciences Center, KY 40292.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We investigated the mechanism by which 1,25-(OH)2D3 induces these changes. We detected 10 nuclear phosphoproteins, designated p66, p45, p36, p33, p32, p27, p22, p19, p18 and p17, that show alterations in phosphorylation within 6-40 h of 1,25-(OH)2D3 treatment. When phosphorylation reactions were performed with isolated nuclei (in vitro), three of these proteins were phosphorylated in a calcium and phospholipid dependent manner: p66, p36, and p19 P66 was phosphorylated in response to 1,25-(OH)2D3 and purified in a manner similar to that used for nuclear lamins. Western blot analysis of 2-dimensional sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) gels confirmed its identity as lamin B. Phosphorylation of p17 and p18 decreased following 1,25-(OH)2D3 treatment. We separated p17 and p18 by SDS-PAGE and obtained N-terminal amino acid sequence to identify these phosphorproteins as histones H2b and H3, respectively. P19 and p22 were both DNA-cellulose binding proteins whose phosphorylation was altered by 1,25-(OH)2D3 treatment. Increased phosphorylation of p27 was detected using 2-dimensional SDS-PAGE. Phosphorylation of nuclear proteins in the intact cell (in vivo), revealed increases in p66, p45, p36, and p33 phosphorylation and a decrease in p17 phosphorylation following 1,25-(OH)2D3 treatment. We detected an increase in phosphorylation of p32, which was extracted with salt from nuclei and migrated on SDS-PAGE similar to histone H1. Thus, we have identified 1,25-(OH)2D3-sensitive nuclear phosphoproteins, including lamin B and several histones. We have also detected and characterized several less abundant nuclear DNA binding phosphoproteins whose phosphorylation was affected by 1,25-(OH)2D3.","['Department of Pharmacology, University of Michigan Medical Center, Ann Arbor 48109-0626.']",['CA-43859/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

On the other hand, persistence of Ph1-positive cells was unable to be demonstrated in the marrow cells from these patients using reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) for detecting bcr-abl chimeric messenger RNA. RT-PCR sensitivity for detecting minimal Ph1-positive cells in a background of Ph1-negative cells proved better than that of the PCR for detecting male cells among female cells. When bone marrow progenitor cells from one of the documented mixed chimeras were analyzed after an in vitro colony assay using PCR, 2 of 12 erythroid burst-forming units (BFU-E) proved to be YDNA-positive, i.e., of host origin, whereas none of them was shown to be Ph1-positive, although 12 BFU-E analyzed in the marrow cells obtained pretransplant from the same patient were all YDNA- and Ph1-positive. These findings indicate that, in some marrow transplant recipients with CML, a small number of host-derived normal haemopoietic progenitor cells may persist following lethal chemoradiotherapy and allogeneic bone marrow transplantation despite the fact that Ph1-positive clones can be eradicated.","['Third Department of Medicine, Kanazawa University School of Medicine, Ishikawa, Japan.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

During culture with IFN-alpha, reproducible changes were induced in both cell lines, which were qualitatively similar but differed quantitatively with small and transient changes in JOK-1. Significant decreases in surface antigen expression were observed for CD 19, 23, 37, and for IgM on both cell lines. Moreover, decreases were seen for CD 10, 22, 45, and MHC class II on Daudi, and for CD 20, 21, 27, and 40 on JOK-1. By contrast, only a few antigens increased in density, including CD 39, A96/G8 and SC9, on both cell lines, CD 22 on JOK-1, and CD 21 on Daudi. The increase in CD 39, A96/G8 and SC9 was probably directly related to the mechanism of action of IFN-alpha, whereas the other changes were most consistent with an unspecific inhibition of protein synthesis, possibly due to an accumulation of cells in G0, even though a differentiating effect cannot be ruled out. Thus, the unique in vivo effect of IFN-alpha in HCL was not paralleled by a specific direct effect on JOK-1 in vitro. Our findings therefore do not support the theory that IFN's mechanism of action in vivo is a direct effect on HC, but suggest that indirect effects are involved.","['University Department of Medicine and Hematology, Aarhus Amtssygehus, Denmark.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

DESIGN: We performed an analysis of 24-hour serum GH profiles using 20-minute sampling. PATIENTS: Forty-four children were studied, of whom 21 were long-term survivors of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia and 23 were normal children. They were further subdivided into prepubertal, pubertal and post-pubertal groups. MEASUREMENTS: GH profiles were analysed by autocorrelation, Fourier transformation and spectral analysis of stationarized data, and peak detection using the Pulsar peak detection program. RESULTS In the normal children, there was a significant increase in the median (range) area under the curve (AUC) of the GH profile between the prepubertal and pubertal groups (62 (11-124) and 137 (142-158) IU/I/h respectively, (P less than 0.01)). There was also a change in the spectral analysis through puberty. The dominant frequencies were spread widely in the prepubertal and post-pubertal groups but sharply focused in the pubertal group. In the cranially irradiated children there was no significant increase in AUC between the prepubertal (62(13-110) IU/I/h) and pubertal groups (92 (14-163) IU/I/h). The wide range of dominant frequencies persisted in the pubertal cranially irradiated group due to the presence of additional high frequency pulses. The impression of a disturbance of the periodicity of GH secretion in the cranially irradiated pubertal group was further supported by the finding that the autocorrelation function in this group alone was not significantly different from that which would arise from random data. CONCLUSIONS: A novel form of GH insufficiency has been observed after low dose irradiation in childhood in which an abnormality of periodicity and a quantitative reduction in GH secretion appears restricted to puberty.","['Christie Hospital, Manchester, UK.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In vitro, this compound stimulates the release of gamma-interferon, interleukins, and hematopoietic growth factors from accessory cells and activates both T- and B-cells. Bryostatin 1 is also able to stimulate neutrophils to undergo oxidative burst and degranulation. Because of the ability of this compound to stimulate the immune system, cause release of immune mediators, and activate neutrophils, we have examined its effect on bacterial infection by using the gram-negative bacterium Salmonella typhimurium in mice. We find that animals given injections i.v. of S. typhimurium have a shortened life span if they are also given injections i.p. of nonlethal doses of bryostatin 1. There is a dose-response relationship with 100 micrograms/kg bryostatin 1 having a greater effect on survival than 40 micrograms/kg. Below 40 micrograms/kg there are no effects on survival. Analysis of the first 4 h of Salmonella infection demonstrates that bryostatin 1 does not affect the blood clearance of the bacterium. However, by day 2 of infection greater numbers of bacteria are found in the livers and spleens of mice given injections of bryostatin 1. By day 5, 10-fold more S. typhimurium bacteria are found in the livers and spleens of mice receiving 40 micrograms/kg of bryostatin 1. To determine whether bryostatin 1 was affecting growth or causing the death of bacteria, we used a Salmonella carrying a plasmid which has a temperature-sensitive origin of replication and is unable to replicate when the bacteria are in mice. This experiment demonstrates that bryostatin 1 represses bacterial killing but does not affect bacterial growth. Bryostatin 1 given i.p. stimulates a transient syndrome of weight loss and diarrhea from which the mice recover and regain weight, suggesting that bryostatin 1 may release a number of important humoral mediators in vivo. The weight loss is exacerbated by Salmonella infection with mice receiving bryostatin 1 and S. typhimurium, in that they lose approximately 33% of body weight prior to death. Thus, at doses used to treat murine tumors, bryostatin 1 treatment does not affect the clearance of S. typhimurium from the blood but does decrease the killing of bacteria in the liver and spleen, leading to early animal death. Such potential effects of bryostatin 1 on the outcome of bacterial infections should be evaluated in ongoing human trials of this agent.","['Division of Hematology/Oncology, University of Alabama, Birmingham 35294.']",['CA16049/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, remissions induced by all-trans RA tend to be brief, and relapses are associated with resistance to further treatment in vivo, although the leukemic cells appear to retain sensitivity to the cytodifferentiating effects of all-trans RA in vitro. The clinical pharmacology of all-trans RA was examined in 13 patients with APL. The drug was administered at a constant dose of 45 mg/m2/day, given as a single dose on the first day of therapy and in two divided doses thereafter. Plasma and urinary concentrations of the parent drug and metabolites were quantitated by reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography and, where required, by a combination of normal-phase liquid chromatography/negative chemical ionization mass spectrometry. In patients with APL, basal levels of endogenous retinol and natural retinoids were within the normal range. Peak plasma levels of all-trans RA (347 +/- 266 ng/ml, mean +/- SD) were reached 1-2 h after drug ingestion and decayed in a monoexponential fashion with a half-life of 0.8 +/- 0.1 h. The only drug metabolite detected in plasma or urine was 4-oxo-all-trans RA (present in urine as the glucuronide conjugate). This metabolite accounted for less than 10% of the circulating drug in plasma, and its cumulative urinary excretion accounted for less than 1% of the administered dose. The drug was not found in cerebrospinal fluid. Continued oral administration of all-trans RA was associated with a significant decrease in both the plasma peak levels and the area under the concentration-time curve (P = 0.01 and 0.004, respectively) when measured after 2-6 weeks of treatment. We previously reported that a decrease in plasma area under the concentration-time curve was highly correlated with clinical relapse. Observations in a subset of patients in this study suggested that, in fact, the major decrease occurred early, within the first 7 days of treatment.

We have evaluated the usefulness of fluorescence in situ hybridization with a chromosome 12-specific probe as a simple means for detecting trisomy 12 in interphase cells. Forty cases of B-cell CLL previously studied with conventional cytogenetic techniques were analyzed with a biotinylated probe to the centromeric region of chromosome 12. Thirty of these retrospective cases could be reevaluated with in situ hybridization. Our analysis showed three hybridization signals (ie, trisomy 12) in interphase cells from seven of seven cases found previously to have trisomy 12. Trisomy 12 was also detected in five additional cases: in one case thought to have a normal karyotype, in two cases that had been inadequate for routine cytogenetic analysis, and in two cases that had been found to have an abnormal karyotype without trisomy 12. In a prospective series of 20 newly accrued CLL cases, all cases were analyzed successfully by in situ hybridization and six (30%) showed trisomy 12. We were able to perform the analysis on routinely prepared and previously Wright-stained peripheral blood smears. We conclude that fluorescence in situ hybridization is a simple means for the detection of trisomy 12 in CLL. The technique is more sensitive than conventional cytogenetic analysis and would be a useful tool in clinical studies.","['Department of Pathology, University of Chicago, IL.']",['CA42557/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

After 4 days, the glucocorticoid dexamethasone at approximately 10 nM kills 50% of CEM-C7 cells. To test the hypothesis that glucocorticoid-mediated lymphocytolysis was due to suppression of lymphokine expression only, we attempted to protect CEM-C7 cells from lysis by provision of lymphokine(s). Conditioned media from interleukin-2 secreting Jurkat T-cells as well as the glucocorticoid-insensitive, but receptor positive clone, CEM-C1, failed to prevent lymphocytolysis; exogenous interleukin-2 also did not provide protection. There were complex, biphasic interactions between dexamethasone and the synthetic PGEs, enisoprost and enisoprost free acid. Low doses of enisoprost alone (0.01 to 1 microgram/ml) stimulated growth, and in combinations completely reversed the growth inhibitory effects of 10 nM dexamethasone. Higher concentrations of enisoprost were inherently lethal and were additive to the steroid effect. Thus the glucocorticoid-induced lymphocytolysis in this human leukemic T-cell line may be modified biphasically by PGE prostaglandins, depending on their concentration. However, interleukin-2 or components in the conditioned media assayed had no effect in ameliorating the lethal response to glucocorticoid.","['Department of Human Biological Chemistry and Genetics, University of Texas Medical Branch, Galveston 77550.']",['CA 41407/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Preclinical studies have shown that EO-9 has greater activity against cells derived from human solid tumours than leukaemias in vitro. The results of this study extend the preclinical data available on EO-9 by demonstrating that EO-9 induces a broad spectrum of activity (IC50 values range from 8 to 590 ng ml-1) against a panel of human and murine tumour cell lines. Some evidence exists of selectivity towards leukaemia and human colon cell lines as opposed to murine colon cells. The response of cells to Mitomycin C were not comparable to EO-9 suggesting that the mechanism of action of these compounds is different. The cytotoxic properties of EO-9 under aerobic conditions are significantly influenced by extracellular pH. Reduction of pH from 7.4 to 5.8 increases cell kill from 40% to 95% in DLD-1 cells. In addition, EO-9 is unstable at acidic pH (T1/2 = 37 min at pH 5.5) compared to neutral pH T1/2 = 6.3 h). The major breakdown product in vitro was identified as EO-5A which proved relatively inactive compared to EO-9 (IC50 = 50 and 0.6 ug ml-1 respectively). These studies suggest that if EO-9 can be delivered to regions of low pH within solid tumours, a therapeutic advantage may be obtained.","['Clinical Oncology Unit, School of Pharmacy, University of Bradford, West Yorkshire, UK.']",,,,,,,PMC1977599,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Five (45%) children with bone marrow relapse during maintenance therapy and six (35%) after cessation of cytostatic treatment were asymptomatic at the time of relapse. Signs indicative of relapse during treatment were lymphoblast cells in the peripheral blood, thrombocytopenia, hepatomegaly, anemia, or leukopenia in decreasing order of frequency. After cessation of treatment these signs were lymphoblasts in the peripheral blood, hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, thrombocytopenia, or leukocytosis. Except for one case with thrombocytopenia, no signs suspicious for relapse were found in the control groups. When each sign was evaluated separately only the presence of lymphoblasts in peripheral blood and hepatomegaly were significant symptoms for relapse after cessation of treatment. The mean percentage of lymphoblasts in the bone marrow at the time of relapse was significantly lower for patients with an unpredicted relapse (46.8%) than patients with clinical and/or laboratory evidence of relapse (79.5%). When lymphoblasts were present in the peripheral blood the percentage of lymphoblasts in the bone marrow was always more than 40%, both during and after cessation of treatment. These data suggest a relation between clinical and laboratory symptoms and progression of the disease.

We report on a prospective, randomized study to compare two different regimens--continuous vs. 3 days a week--of cotrimoxazole prophylaxis. The aim of the study was to evaluate the toxicity, assuming that both regimens are equally effective to prevent P. carinii pneumonia. Seventy-seven leukemic children were enrolled; 67 were evaluable, 35 from arm A (continuous), 32 from arm B (intermittent cotrimoxazole administration). The conclusion was that long-term maintenance chemotherapy with antimetabolites produced lower levels of folate but normal levels of vitamin B12 in leukemic children.

In this report, we investigated the effects of DW A2114R, in comparison with CDDP, on the cell growth, the cell cycle traverse and the colony-forming ability of human leukemia RPMI 8402 cells in vitro. The inhibitory effects of DW A2114R on the cell growth and the colony-forming ability were about 1/10 and 1/10-1/30, respectively, of the CDDP dose. And DW A2114R showed a higher time-dependency than CDDP in the experiment comparing exposure time to the drugs. Analysis of DNA histograms obtained by flow cytometry revealed that DW A2114R had a similar effect on the cell cycle traverse to that of CDDP. Both drugs exerted their growth-inhibitory effect by blocking cells at G2 phase. At higher concentrations, they prolonged the traverse of cells through S phase and completely inhibited them throughout the cell cycle. The comparative study on the colony-forming ability suggested that the G2 phase accumulation was irreversible and that these drugs are lethal, so the G2 phase accumulation could be considered a cytocidal effect of the drugs. In early clinical studies, however, the dose of DW A2114R was put at about 15-fold higher than the therapeutic dose of CDDP. This was comparable with our results in vitro and DW A2114R showed a much lower toxicities, with special regard to nephrotoxicity, than CD DP. These clinical data and our results suggest that DW A2114R could be clinically effective as an antitumor agent.","['Dept. of Transfusion Medicine, Tokyo Metropolitan Komagome Hospital, Japan.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the patients with AML, blood ACR or IDA level increased and then disappeared very rapidly after iv bolus injection. In contrast, their metabolites (M1 or IDAol) increased for up to 2 or 4 hrs and remained much longer than ACR or IDA. The concentration of ACR, IDA or their metabolites were found to be much higher in the leukocyte fraction than in erythrocyte fraction or plasma. In HL60 cell suspension, anthracyclines were rapidly accumulated into the cells, and the uptake of IDA or THP were higher than the other agents. In HL60 cells, anthracyclines accumulated in the nuclear fraction but ACR was accumulated markedly in the cytosol fraction. From the result of DNA binding assay, binding at excess to calf thymus DNA of ACR was suggested to be approximately 2 times higher than that of other agents. DNA strand brakes in HL60 cells treated with anthracyclines were shown by pulse field gel electrophoresis, and IDA was found to have stronger activity to cause the DNA strand breaks. In conclusion, it seemed that anthracyclines showed similar action mechanisms, but in some respects quantitative differences were existed among them. Anthracyclines should be given to patients based on their pharmacological characteristics to obtain higher remission rate and suppress resistant cells.","['First Dept. of Internal Medicine, Fukui Medical School, Japan.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Two central questions have been studied: 'does leukemia occur more often in GH-deficient children in GH-therapy than in age-related normal individuals' and 'which influences of GH administration upon normal and leukemic leukocytes have been described?'. In some cases leukemia developed in GH-deficient children after GH-therapy. The data have shown a higher incidence of leukemia in the population of children treated with GH (5:100,000) than in the age-related normal population of children (2:100,000). However, hard evidence supporting the hypothesis that GH-therapy could induce leukemia has not yet been found. In vivo studies could not detect enhanced growth of blood cells influenced by GH-therapy. In vitro studies showed that GH either stimulated or did not affect the proliferation of unstimulated lymphocytes of GH-deficient children, normal individuals or leukemia-patients. The same effects occurred in leukemic cell lines. On PHA-stimulated lymphocytes of GH-deficient children and normal individuals both enhancing and inhibiting effects of GH have been found. It is suggested that GH-therapy could improve immunological resistance against tumors by improving Natural-Killer-cell activity. In mice GH seemed to influence lymphocyte-differentiation. In mice also an increase in the frequency of chromosomal aberrations related to GH has been observed. This evaluation suggests that patients, treated with GH-therapy should be carefully followed up. Also, the indication for GH-therapy has to be guarded critically.","['Afd. Kindergeneeskunde, AZVU, Amsterdam.']",,,Groeihormoon therapie en leukemie.,30,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In contrast to Myc RNA, Max RNA does not decline immediately upon induction of differentiation of HL60 cells by dimethyl sulfoxide, and only a modest decrease of Max RNA was observed 72 h after induction of differentiation. Unlike Myc RNA, Max RNA is relatively stable with a half-life of greater than 3 h and, therefore, does not exhibit the characteristic short half-life of RNAs encoded by most immediate early genes.

We report a case of priapism in a 40-year-old man after administration of total parenteral nutrition for chronic idiopathic intestinal pseudo-obstruction. The patient received glucose, amino acids, and 20% fat emulsion; 12 hours after administration, the patient complained of a persistent, painful penile erection lasting 5 hours. Bilateral corpora cavernosa spongiosum shunts achieved immediate and sustained detumescence, but the patient remained impotent. There was no history of penile or pelvic trauma, hemoglobinopathy, coagulopathy, venous thrombosis, or leukemia. The medical literature describes seven other cases of priapism related to total parenteral nutrition. All of the patients received 20% fat emulsion; two patients developed priapism during the weekly infusion of fat emulsion. Among the multiple factors that can favor thrombosis and therefore priapism during total parenteral nutrition, fat infusion appears to be the most important. Three different mechanisms have been postulated: increase in blood coagulability, effects on red blood cells, and fat embolism. In this patient, platelet function was estimated in vivo by the levels of antiheparin platelet factor 4 and beta-thromboglobulin. These two parameters were both elevated before 20% lipid emulsion and were even higher after the 20% fat-emulsion infusion. Therefore, even if a direct thromboplastic effect is possible, 20% fat emulsion increases platelet activity, which was already high in our patient, and thereby favors priapism.","[""Service de Gastroenterologie et Nutrition, Hopital de l'Archet, Nice, France.""]",,,,33,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Therefore, we analyzed the technical parameters of obtaining, separating and purifying these cells simultaneously from several blood samples of several cats. Flow cytometric studies with outbred cats indicated that of various cell separation/purification methods, e.g. from lysed whole blood, by Histopaque 1.077 or 1.119 single-density, or by 1.077/1.119 double-density centrifugation, the 1.077/1.119 double-density centrifugation of diluted whole blood is the most consistent, practical and effective method of yielding both highly purified PBMC and PMNC as separate entities from the same sample. The interface between plasma and 1.077 contained an average 86% PBMC vs. 14% PMNC, and the interface between 1.077 and 1.119 an average of 2% PBMC vs. 98% PMNC. Lymphocytes separated by this method had an average CD4/CD8 T-cell ratio of 2.0. These data indicate that Histopaque 1.077/1.119 double-density gradient allows purification and physical separation of lymphocytes and phagocytes from a blood sample, enabling the investigator to examine both cell types from the same sample simultaneously.","['Virginia-Maryland Regional College of Veterinary Medicine, Virginia Tech, Blacksburg 24061.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Uptake of cisplatin by both resistant lines was significantly reduced, compared with values for the respective parent lines (17% for L-1210/DDP and 27% for P388/DDP, at 100 microM for 1 h). While glutathione contents in the resistant cells were 1.7-1.9 times higher than those in the sensitive ones, their reduction by preincubation with buthionine sulfoximine did not influence the sensitivity of the cells to cisplatin. In addition, the resistant lines did not show lower sensitivity to CdCl2 than the respective sensitive ones, suggesting that intracellular SH groups might contribute little to the mechanism of cisplatin resistance in these cells. Postincubation with DNA repair inhibitors, caffeine and aphidicolon, did not selectively enhance the sensitivity of the resistant cells to cisplatin. These results suggested that reduced drug uptake would be a primary mechanism of cisplatin resistance in L-1210/DDP and P388/DDP. Cross-resistance patterns to platinum complexes were quite different between L-1210/DDP and P388/DDP.

The exposure to ara-C inhibits the proliferation of a higher proportion of clonogenic cells in culture pretreated with IL-3 than in control or cells pretreated with IL-1. The enhanced cytotoxic effect of ara-C in the cells pretreated with IL-3 correlated with increased formation of intracellular ara-CTP. IL-3-induced recruitment of quiescent blasts into the proliferative compartment will lead to increased formation of ara-CTP in the cells, which would result in an enhanced leukemia cell kill.","['Nagoya National Hospital, Hematological Disease Center.']",,,,,,,PMC5918782,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

DESIGN: Hyperinsulinemia was determined by measuring the insulin responses during a 2-hour oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT). Quantification of in vivo insulin action was determined by a frequently sampled intravenous (IV) OGTT with minimal modeling analysis. In vitro sensitivity to insulin at physiological and supraphysiological concentrations and to IGF-I was assessed by examining colony formation of two hematopoietic cell populations, burst-forming units of the erythroid line (BFU-E) and human leukemia virus immortalized T-cell lines. (The proliferative responses of BFU-E, a primary tissue explant, are presumably conditioned by factors in the immediate blood-borne environment, whereas proliferative responses of T-cell lines are presumed to reflect intrinsic target-cell hormone sensitivity.) SETTING: Tertiary care research institution. PATIENTS: Eight patients (4 obese and 4 nonobese) with PCOS and three healthy women for reference controls. RESULTS: Nonobese (P less than 0.04) and obese patients with PCOS (P less than 0.01) both demonstrated significant hyperinsulinemia after OGTT. In vivo insulin resistance was observed in both nonobese (P less than 0.03) and obese PCOS subjects (P less than 0.01) using frequently sampled IV OGTT. Both nonobese (P less than 0.03) and obese patients with PCOS (P less than 0.01) had blunted in vitro clonal responses of BFU-E, with normal T-cell line clonal responsiveness to physiological levels of insulin and normal BFU-E and T-cell line clonal responses to IGF-I. CONCLUSIONS: These findings demonstrate the following in both nonobese and obese patients with PCOS: (1) there is in vivo hyperinsulinemia and resistance to insulin action on glucose disposal; (2) with BFU-E, there is in vitro resistance to the mitogenic action of insulin but normal responsiveness to IGF-I; and (3) there is normal in vitro mitogenic responsiveness of T-cell lines to both insulin and IGF-I. The intrinsically normal mitogenic responsiveness to insulin and, especially to IGF-I, whether or not under the influence of the bloodborne milieu, provides a mechanism whereby hyperinsulinemia could directly contribute to the ovarian abnormalities that characterize PCOS.","['Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, UCLA.']","['CA30388/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CC32737/CC/ODCDC CDC HHS/United States', 'RR00865/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Since several immunological abnormalities are observed in most conditions associated with an increase in sIL-2R levels, a down-regulatory effect on IL-2-dependent functions has been postulated as a consequence of binding and functional block of IL-2 by the excess of sIL-2R. To test this hypothesis, we purified sIL-2R from the urine of a patient with hairy cell leukemia and investigated the possible inhibitory effect of this peptide on the in vitro IL-2-induced cell proliferation. The urine-purified molecule was detectable by the specific immunoassay utilized to measure the serum Tac peptide and was constructed by a single polypeptide of about 50 kDa which was able to bind IL-2. Experiments performed with the IL-2-dependent murine CTLL-2 cell line and with PHA-stimulated human peripheral blood mononuclear cells showed that the purified sIL-2R at concentrations up to about 300 nM was unable to block IL-2-dependent cell proliferation. According to these data, which can be explained by the low affinity for IL-2 of the p55 IL-2R chain, it seems unlikely that in vivo the soluble Tac peptide can exert a down regulatory effect on IL-2-induced phenomena through a functional block of IL-2.","['Cattedra di Ematologia, Istituto di Patologia Generale, Verona, Italy.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The present study was undertaken in an attempt to identify the protein(s) responsible for the tyrosine protein kinase activity and to seek a potential role for this activity in the mature cell. We and others have detected the p92c-fes tyrosine protein kinase in WEHI-3B cells. This protein has been implicated in myeloid differentiation, as well as in the transduction of signals in response to granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF). Thus, it was of interest to determine whether tyrosine phosphorylation may be involved in the response of WEHI-3B cells to GM-CSF. Treatment of differentiated WEHI-3B D+ cells with GM-CSF was found to result in the tyrosine phosphorylation of a number of endogenous cellular proteins in a concentration-dependent, rapid and transient manner. In contrast, the cytokine did not elicit such a response in undifferentiated cells, despite the fact that undifferentiated cells have been reported to possess GM-CSF receptors. These findings are consistent with the concept that the effects of GM-CSF on differentiated myeloid cells are mediated through tyrosine phosphorylation, that only differentiated cells are competent to accomplish this event, and that this response constitutes at least one functional role for the myeloid differentiation associated tyrosine protein kinase activity.","['Department of Pharmacology, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, CT 06510.']",['CA-02817/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,['c-fes'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The standardized incidence ratio was near expected for person-years after age 14 (25 cases observed) but lower than expected for person-years in the age group 0-14 years (eight cases observed, standardized incidence ratio 0.58, 95% confidence interval 0.25-1.14). This negative association was stronger when more precise criteria for time of exposure were applied, especially for children 0-14 years with fathers in categories exposed to lead 1 year before the child's birth. Methodologic problems with this approach are nondifferential exposure misclassification and the need for large data sets.

Rat 6 clones acquiring the c-myc gene display various degrees of altered morphology. They form orderly but densely packed cells, grow to higher saturation density, and yield microcolonies in soft agar. The degree of altered growth properties is directly correlated with the level of c-myc expression. Transient exposure of c-myc-expressing clones to BP and MNNG induced the formation of distinct, large colonies in soft agar, whereas the untreated cells formed microcolonies and the parental Rat 6 cells remained single cells in soft agar. We also demonstrated that the degree of responsiveness to chemical carcinogens of the clones correlates with their ability to form microcolonies in soft agar. These cells overexpressing c-myc may be used as a model system to study the interaction between oncogenes and chemical carcinogens in the process of multistage carcinogenesis.","['Department of Molecular Biology and Biochemistry, University of California, Irvine 92717.']",['N01-ES-75173/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States'],,,,['c-myc'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Using a colon carcinoma cell line, we developed a technique to detect extrachromosomal circular DNA-specific sequences by Alu-polymerase chain reaction. Circular DNA was enriched by selective alkaline denaturation of genomic DNA. We have successfully performed this procedure with a minimum of 5 x 10(5) cells. The technique does not require any prior knowledge of the sequences located on the covalent circular DNA molecules for their detection. The procedure should be useful as a routine screen of primary tumor cells for the presence of extrachromosomal circular DNA and should permit the preparation of specific probes ot aid in their detailed characterizations.","['Division of Laboratory Medicine, University of Texas M.

Whereas cyclosporine immunosuppression was fully reversible, UV cross-linking of PL-CS resulted in permanent inhibition of lymphocyte activation as shown by proliferation of anti-CD3 stimulated human peripheral lymphocyte, interleukin (IL)-2 gene transcription and IL-2 synthesis in the human T-leukemia cell line Jurkat.

Since methylation of selenium is considered to be detoxifying, the toxicologic activity of SB or SBME may differ from that of inorganic forms of selenium, such as selenite, that undergo reduction and can induce cell damage. In this study, the effects of SB, SBME and selenite on the viability and long-term growth potential of a mouse leukemia cell line (L1210) were compared. Treatment with 20 microM selenite reduced the rate of cell doubling and the long-term growth potential of cells as measured by colony-forming ability. These effects of selenite were accompanied by a reduction in DNA integrity, assessed by alkaline elution analysis for single-strand breaks. Exposure to 500 microM SB or SBME for 24 hr reduced the colony-forming ability of cells in the absence of any effect on dye exclusion or induction of single-strand breaks in DNA. Exposure of cells to 500 microM SB or SBME resulted in levels of intracellular selenium similar to those after exposure to 20 microM selenite. These observations indicate that it is possible to maintain high intracellular levels of selenium, by exposure to methylated selenocompounds, without affecting DNA integrity. These findings also suggest that DNA fragmentation resulting from exposure to selenite occurs during its reductive metabolism and not from the accumulation of a methylated metabolite of selenium. The fact that SB or SBME reduced the ability of L1210 cells to form colonies in agar in the absence of either DNA fragmentation or any effect on the ability of treated cells to exclude a vital dye suggests that both methylated compounds alter the long-term proliferative potential of cells via a mechanism(s) distinct from that associated with cell injury and death by necrosis. Efforts are underway to determine the origin of these effects.","['Laboratory of Nutrition Research, AMC Cancer Research Center, Denver, CO 80214.']",['CA 45145/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Some evidence indicates that these prostaglandins are conjugated to glutathione by cells. However, the metabolism of one group, the prostaglandins of the A type, is unclear due to conflicting reports. We studied the uptake and metabolism of prostaglandin A2 (PGA2) in mouse L1210 leukemia and L929 fibroblast cell lines in which this prostaglandin has antiviral and antigrowth effects. Both cell types took up the PGA2 and then metabolized it to a more polar compound. Inside L1210 cells, PGA2 was initially conjugated to glutathione and then reduced at the 9-keto position to form 9-OH-PGA2-GSH. The 9-OH-PGA2-GSH was then secreted from the cells and apparently degraded to form the CysGly and Cys derivatives. Intracellular glutathione was decreased markedly by the addition of the PGA2 in L1210 and L929 cells. This result confirms that conjugation of PGA2 to glutathione occurs in both cell types. Formation of the 9-OH-PGA2-GSH and other glutathione-related conjugates was prevented when glutathione was depleted by growth in buthionine sulfoximine. The glutathione-depleted cells were insensitive to the cytotoxicity of the PGA2, suggesting that one of the glutathione-related conjugates may be involved in the cytotoxicity of PGA2. These results end the controversy over the metabolism of PGA2 and suggest mechanisms for its antiviral and antigrowth actions.","['Department of Biochemistry, Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee 53226.']",['AI23450/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
