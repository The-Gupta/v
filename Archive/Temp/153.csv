METHODS: The FCM immunophenotyping of B-lymphocyte precursors in regenerating stage and MRD was analyzed by using two sets of 4-color antibody panels, including mainly CD34, CD10, CD45, CD19, in 26 regenerating bone marrow samples after chemotherapy and 297 consecutive bone marrow specimens from 50 patients with B-ALL, respectively. The immunophenotype of leukemia cells of B-ALL was also detected by four to six antibodies combination of 4-color CD45/SSC gating FCM. The CD19, CD10, CD34 fluorescence intensity of B-cell precursors in normal and leukemic bone marrow was compared by relatively quantitative method. RESULTS: Twelve patients were MRD positive (MRD(+)) among 50 patients during MRD monitoring, the percentages of residual leukemia cells were 0.06% to 7.73%. Eleven cases displayed CD45, CD34, CD19, CD10 antigens aberrant expression. Five patients were bone marrow relapsed and 4 of them were MRD (+) 7-17 weeks before relapse. The percentages of leukemia cells in all the 4 patients were over 0.1%. Only one patient relapsed with MRD negative. The regenerated B precursors could be divided into 3 stages according to the expression of CD45, CD34, CD19, CD10, CD22, and CD20 antigens. Abnormal expression of CD45, CD34, CD19, and CD10 were detected in 71.8% of 213 patients with B-ALL, the percentage of only aberrant expression of CD38 and myeloid antigen was 8.1%. CONCLUSION: Detection of MRD by multiparameter flow cytometry is a rapid, quantitative and sensitive approach, and has a higher predictability for relapse.","['Liu, Yan-rong', 'Wang, Hui', 'Chang, Yan', 'Cheng, Yi-fei', 'Fu, Jia-yu', 'Zhang, Le-ping', 'Liu, Gui-lan', 'Chen, Shan-shan']","['Liu YR', 'Wang H', 'Chang Y', 'Cheng YF', 'Fu JY', 'Zhang LP', 'Liu GL', 'Chen SS']","[""Institute of Hematology, People's Hospital of Peking University, Beijing 100044, China.""]",['chi'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",China,Zhonghua Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi,Zhonghua xue ye xue za zhi = Zhonghua xueyexue zazhi,8212398,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry/*methods', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping/methods', 'Leukemia, B-Cell/*diagnosis', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm, Residual/*diagnosis']",2005/09/28 09:00,2009/05/08 09:00,['2005/09/28 09:00'],"['2005/09/28 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/05/08 09:00 [medline]', '2005/09/28 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Zhonghua Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi. 2005 Jun;26(6):327-31.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The epidermal growth factor (EGF), its cognate receptor (EGFR) and related family members have been shown to be important in normal, as well as the malignant growth of many cell types including: glioblastomata, astrocytomas, medulloblastomata, non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) and breast cancer. This review summarises the history of the EGFR gene and the v-ErbB oncogene, as well as diverse approaches developed to inhibit EGFR activity. The two most advanced therapies use either small-molecule cell membrane permeable kinase inhibitors or antibodies which prevent receptor activation. Recent clinical trials indicate that certain NSCLC patients have mutations in the EGFR gene which makes them more responsive to kinase inhibitors. These mutations appear to enhance the ability of the ligand to activate EGFR activity and also prolong the binding of the EGFR inhibitor to the kinase domain. Evidence to date suggests that these EGFR mutations in NSCLC occur more frequently in Japan than in the western hemisphere. Although these mutations are correlated with enhanced efficacy to the inhibitors in NSCLC, they can not explain or predict the sensitivity of many other cancer patients to the beneficial effects of the EGFR kinase inhibitors or antibody mediated therapy. As with as other small-molecule kinase inhibitors and susceptible diseases (e.g., imatinib and chronic myeloid leukaemia), resistance to EGFR inhibitors has been reported recently, documenting the requirement for development of multi-pronged therapeutic approaches. EGFR kinase inhibitors are also being evaluated as adjuvants in hormonal therapy of breast cancer - especially those which overexpress EGFR. Genetically engineered antibodies specific for the EGFR family member ErbB2 have been developed which show efficacy in the treatment of primary, and prevent the relapse of, breast cancer. Clearly, the EGF/EGFR signalling cascade has, and continues to play, an important role in the development of novel anticancer targeted therapies.","['Shelton, John G', 'Steelman, Linda S', 'Abrams, Steve L', 'Bertrand, Fred E', 'Franklin, Richard A', 'McMahon, Martin', 'McCubrey, James A']","['Shelton JG', 'Steelman LS', 'Abrams SL', 'Bertrand FE', 'Franklin RA', 'McMahon M', 'McCubrey JA']","['Brody School of Medicine at East Carolina University, Department of Microbiology & Immunology, Greenville, NC 27858, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",England,Expert Opin Ther Targets,Expert opinion on therapeutic targets,101127833,IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Epidermal Growth Factor/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Humans', '*Multigene Family', 'Neoplasms/*drug therapy/genetics/*metabolism', '*Pharmacogenetics']",2005/09/28 09:00,2007/01/26 09:00,['2005/09/28 09:00'],"['2005/09/28 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/01/26 09:00 [medline]', '2005/09/28 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Expert Opin Ther Targets. 2005 Oct;9(5):1009-30. doi: 10.1517/14728222.9.5.1009.,['R01 CA98195/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '62229-50-9 (Epidermal Growth Factor)']",201,['10.1517/14728222.9.5.1009 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Today, kinase inhibitors garner substantial attention in cancer research. Over the last few years, three distinct small-molecule kinase inhibitors reached the market for treatment of chronic myeloid leukaemia, gastrointestinal stromal tumours, and non-small cell lung cancers. These three drugs, imatinib, gefitinib and erlotinib, act on a distinct subset of dysregulated, and often cancer-relevant kinases. Imatinib, gefitinib and erlotinib are considered the front-runners of targeted kinase inhibitor drugs. The entire research field gains tremendous insights through the ongoing research and clinical trials with these three drugs and with fast following first-generation kinase inhibitors, many of which are in different phases of clinical development.

Since then, platelet-associated IgG (PAIgG) has been thought of as evidence of ITP. Although platelets from ITP patients show significantly higher PAIgG values than from normal control individuals, PAIgG is not specific for autoantibody because it increases in other than immune ITP patients. METHODS: We analyzed positive platelet percentage with various platelet-associated immunoglobulins: IgG, IgM, IgA, and total immunoglobulins, in the blood from 17 normal donors and 23 ITP patients. RESULTS: The specificity for ITP disease was better in flow cytometry than in ELISA, because, other than ITP, only aplastic anemia was positive in flow cytometry; however, various disorders (aplastic anemia, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, acute myeloid leukemia, and myelodysplastic syndrome) showed positive in ELISA. Flow cytometry methods had the same sensitivity for ITP disease as ELISA. However, it is supposed that there was no nonimmune ITP in this study because the PAIgG negative patients (n = 1) showed positive results in flow cytometry.

However, little is known about how phenotypic shifts between diagnosis and relapse affect MRD detection in childhood acute lymphoid leukemia (ALL). METHODS: We compared diagnostic and relapse bone marrow specimens in 42 children with precursor B-ALL studied with the two-tube panel CD19-APC/CD45-PerCP/CD10-PE/CD20-FITC and CD19-APC/CD45-PerCP/CD9-PE/CD34-FITC. RESULTS: At least 29 cases had phenotypic shifts of intensity or coefficient of variation of distribution of one or more markers. Shifts were complex and could not be explained by change in maturation stage. In the majority of cases MRD populations more closely resembled the diagnostic than the relapse specimen. In 6 of 7 MRD negative cases we did not identify an abnormal population that resembled diagnosis or relapse. In the remaining case, in which CD34 and CD10 were lost between diagnosis and relapse, it is possible that we could have missed an MRD population resembling relapse. CONCLUSIONS: Phenotypic shifts are common, but do not affect MRD recognition. At most 1 of 42 cases might have harbored an abnormal population undetected because of shift. However, MRD analysis with rigid gating (looking strictly for abnormal phenotypes at diagnosis) might have missed many positive cases, 8 of 22 (36%) in this series.","['Borowitz, Michael J', 'Pullen, D Jeanette', 'Winick, Naomi', 'Martin, Paul L', 'Bowman, W Paul', 'Camitta, Bruce']","['Borowitz MJ', 'Pullen DJ', 'Winick N', 'Martin PL', 'Bowman WP', 'Camitta B']","['Department of Pathology and Oncology, Johns Hopkins Medical Institutions, Baltimore, Maryland 21231, USA. mborowit@jhmi.edu']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",United States,Cytometry B Clin Cytom,"Cytometry.

Thirty-six boy and 23 girl survivors, treated for ALL, were cross-sectionally studied, at a mean age of 11.7 years (range 6-19). Group 1 (n = 30) received CDP therapy (prednisolone, 2 mg/kg/day, orally) and group 2 (n = 29) received HDMP therapy (prednol-L, 900-600 mg/m2, orally). All other therapies were similar in both groups. Cranial irradiation was added for high-risk patients as soon as possible after consolidation therapy. We found that mean lumbar spine BMD z score value was -1.75 (0.83) SDS in group 1 and -1.66 (1.21) SDS in group 2. There is no difference between both groups (P = 0.736). The mean BMD z scores of prepubertal and pubertal patients were not significantly different in both groups. Comparison of serum bone turnover parameters of the patients revealed no difference between the two groups. Stepwise regression analysis revealed that lumbar spine BMD z scores was predicted by height SDS and the time past since cessation of therapy, but not age at diagnosis, BMI SDS, cranial radiotherapy, and puberty. Our study results showed that HDMP treatment did not deteriorate the bone mass any more than CDP treatment. These results proved that high-dose steroid therapy over a short period of time in remission-induction treatment would not affect the bone mass any more adversely than would conventional doses approximately 3 years after cessation of chemotherapy.","['Alikasifoglu, Ayfer', 'Yetgin, Sevgi', 'Cetin, Mualla', 'Tuncer, Murat', 'Gumruk, Fatma', 'Gurgey, Aytemiz', 'Yordam, Nursen']","['Alikasifoglu A', 'Yetgin S', 'Cetin M', 'Tuncer M', 'Gumruk F', 'Gurgey A', 'Yordam N']","['Hacettepe University, Department of Pediatrics, Division of Pediatric Endocrinology, Sihhiye, Ankara, Turkey.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,Am J Hematol,American journal of hematology,7610369,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Biomarkers/blood', 'Bone Density/*drug effects', 'Bone Remodeling/*drug effects', 'Child', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Lumbosacral Region', 'Male', 'Methylprednisolone/administration & dosage/*adverse effects', 'Osteoporosis/chemically induced', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*complications/*drug therapy', 'Prednisolone/administration & dosage/*adverse effects', 'Remission Induction/methods', 'Survivors']",2005/09/27 09:00,2005/11/16 09:00,['2005/09/27 09:00'],"['2005/09/27 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/11/16 09:00 [medline]', '2005/09/27 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Am J Hematol. 2005 Oct;80(2):113-8. doi: 10.1002/ajh.20438.,,"['0 (Biomarkers)', '9PHQ9Y1OLM (Prednisolone)', 'X4W7ZR7023 (Methylprednisolone)']",,['10.1002/ajh.20438 [doi]'],,"['(c) 2005 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We analyzed methylation of the master regulators (p73, p53, Rb), CDKIs (p27, p57), and the INK4 locus (p15) in childhood ALLs and describe a relatively low frequency. Comparisons with adult ALL showed that p57 clearly differed in children (7% methylation) and adults (50% methylation). While >20% of adult ALL Ph1 chromosome-negative undergo methylation of p73, p57, and p15, only 3% of childhood ALL carried such anomalies, which is very significant when a higher fraction of pediatric patients has non-Ph1 ALL than do the adult patients. We have studied a large p57 CpG island and expression by real-time RT-PCR. We observed that 53% of childhood leukemias lacked p57 transcripts, and the overall level was 8-fold lower than in normal lymphocytes (P < 0.0001). However, no correlation with methylation was found. Thus, loss of p57 expression in the absence of methylation may be frequent in childhood ALL, suggesting that methylation is not the sole mechanism of p57 downregulation.

All patients underwent myeloablative conditioning regimens and exhibited good clinical results during a median follow-up period of 6.6 years (range, 3.4-7.5 years). Female-derived cells were detected throughout the entire follow-up period in all bone marrow samples, but they became undetectable in the peripheral blood samples of 3 patients. Moreover, the HUMARA band pattern suggests that these residual host cells were normal cells. This study confirms the usefulness of the HUMARA gene-based assay, which showed that patients undergoing HCT frequently show mixed chimerism (MC) for a long period, especially in bone marrow, although the possibility of contamination by host stromal cells cannot be excluded.","['Karasawa, Masamitsu', 'Yamane, Arito', 'Mitsui, Takeki', 'Irisawa, Hiroyuki', 'Sakura, Tohru', 'Matsushima, Takafumi', 'Tsukamoto, Norifumi', 'Nojima, Yoshihisa', 'Miyawaki, Shuichi']","['Karasawa M', 'Yamane A', 'Mitsui T', 'Irisawa H', 'Sakura T', 'Matsushima T', 'Tsukamoto N', 'Nojima Y', 'Miyawaki S']","['Blood Transfusion Service, University Hospital, Faculty of Medicine, Gunma University, Gunma, Japan. karasawa@showa.gunma-u.ac.jp']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Am J Hematol,American journal of hematology,7610369,IM,"['Adult', 'Chromosomes, Human, X', 'Female', 'Genetic Techniques/*standards', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/therapy', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Middle Aged', 'Receptors, Androgen/genetics', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Sex Factors', '*Transplantation Chimera/genetics']",2005/09/27 09:00,2005/11/16 09:00,['2005/09/27 09:00'],"['2005/09/27 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/11/16 09:00 [medline]', '2005/09/27 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Am J Hematol. 2005 Oct;80(2):101-5. doi: 10.1002/ajh.20465.,,"['0 (AR protein, human)', '0 (Receptors, Androgen)']",,['10.1002/ajh.20465 [doi]'],,"['(c) 2005 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A 57-year-old man had skin tumors and was diagnosed as having blastic NK-cell lymphoma by tumor biopsy. Skin, lymph nodes, left tonsil, and bone marrow were involved at presentation. Chemotherapy led to complete remission (CR). To sustain CR, the patient underwent high-dose chemotherapy in combination with 12 Gy of total-body irradiation (TBI) followed by autologous peripheral blood stem-cell rescue. He showed rapid recovery of hematopoiesis and could tolerate regimen-related toxicity after APBSCT. He has maintained long-term remission for 20 months after APBSCT. From this case, we concluded that APBSCT with preconditioning by TBI-containing regimens might be a cure-attaining treatment for disseminated blastic NK-cell lymphoma and should be considered as a choice of treatment in cases where no suitable donors for allogeneic transplantation are available.","['Yamaguchi, Masaki', 'Maekawa, Mio', 'Nakamura, Yoshihisa', 'Ueda, Mikio']","['Yamaguchi M', 'Maekawa M', 'Nakamura Y', 'Ueda M']","['Department of Hematology & Immunology, Ishikawa Prefectural Central Hospital, Kanazawa, Japan. myjody@ipch.jp']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",United States,Am J Hematol,American journal of hematology,7610369,IM,"['Blast Crisis', 'Hematopoiesis', 'Humans', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*pathology', 'Lymphoma, T-Cell/pathology/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Peripheral Blood Stem Cell Transplantation/*methods', 'Remission Induction/methods', 'Skin Neoplasms', 'Transplantation Conditioning/methods', 'Transplantation, Autologous', 'Whole-Body Irradiation']",2005/09/27 09:00,2005/11/16 09:00,['2005/09/27 09:00'],"['2005/09/27 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/11/16 09:00 [medline]', '2005/09/27 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Am J Hematol. 2005 Oct;80(2):124-7. doi: 10.1002/ajh.20383.,,,,['10.1002/ajh.20383 [doi]'],,"['(c) 2005 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Using a national population-based case-control study, self-reported occupational data from fathers of 3596 children diagnosed with cancer between 1991 and 1996 under 15 years of age (cases) and fathers of 7011 children without cancer (controls) were analysed. Associations were assessed using odds ratios (OR) calculated by time of exposure (birth, diagnosis), diagnostic group (all cancers, leukaemia, acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL), central nervous system tumours, other cancers), level of occupational social contact (high, medium, low), urban-rural status at diagnosis and occupational title. RESULTS: From 371 occupations, 75 (20%) were classified as having high levels of occupational social contact, 31 (8%) as medium and the remaining 265 (71%) as low. No associations were apparent for fathers' occupational social contact overall, for any time period or diagnostic group. OR for leukaemia and high levels of paternal occupational social contact at birth and diagnosis being 1.02 (95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.88-1.18) and 0.91 (95% CI = 0.79-1.06), respectively. Analyses by urban-rural status at diagnosis and by occupational title revealed no notable associations. CONCLUSIONS: The analyses of paternal occupational histories do not support the suggested association between high levels of paternal occupational social contact and an increased risk of childhood leukaemia.

METHODS: Incident cases of childhood leukemia (age 0-14 years) were rapidly ascertained, and controls were randomly selected from birth records and individually matched to cases. A total of 366 cases [313 acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and 53 acute myeloid leukemia (AML)] and 460 controls were included in this analysis. The biological mothers of all subjects provided detailed reproductive history and birth characteristics of the index children during a personal interview. Odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were estimated using conditional logistic regression. Data on maternal pregnancy loss and birth characteristics were also available from the birth certificates of 96.3% of all subjects. RESULTS: History of miscarriage was associated with a significantly increased risk of AML (OR = 2.94, 95% CI: 1.03, 8.34), but not ALL. Neither birth weight, birth order, or parental ages appeared to be an important predictor of the risk of ALL or AML. A comparison between data from two different sources (interview versus birth certificate) indicated good reproducibility and offered some evidence against recall bias.

We now report that As2O3 inhibits ligand-induced transcription of the retinoic acid receptor, as well as other nuclear receptors that heterodimerize with the retinoid X receptor alpha (RXRalpha). As2O3 did not inhibit transactivation of the estrogen receptor or the glucocorticoid receptor, which do not heterodimerize with RXRalpha. We further show that As2O3 inhibits expression of several target genes of RXRalpha partners. Phosphorylation of RXRalpha has been reported to inhibit nuclear receptor signaling, and we show by in vivo labeling and phosphoamino acid detection that As2O3 phosphorylated RXRalpha in the N-terminal ABC region exclusively on serine residues. Consistent with our previous data implying a role for JNK in As2O3-induced apoptosis, we show that pharmacologic or genetic inhibition of JNK activation decreased As2O3-induced RXRalpha phosphorylation and blocked the effects of As2O3 on RXRalpha-mediated transcription. A mutational analysis indicated that phosphorylation of a specific serine residue, S32, was primarily responsible for inhibition of RXRalpha-mediated transcription. These data may provide some insight into the rational development of chemotherapeutic combinations involving As2O3 as well as into molecular mechanisms of arsenic-induced carcinogenesis resulting from environmental exposure.","['Mann, Koren K', 'Padovani, Alessandra M S', 'Guo, Qi', 'Colosimo, April L', 'Lee, Ho-Young', 'Kurie, Jonathan M', 'Miller, Wilson H Jr']","['Mann KK', 'Padovani AM', 'Guo Q', 'Colosimo AL', 'Lee HY', 'Kurie JM', 'Miller WH Jr']","['Montreal Centre for Experimental Therapeutics in Cancer, Lady Davis Institute for Medical Research, Sir Mortimer B.

Since fluoride is known as an inhibitor of glycolytic enzymes, we investigated the possible connection between NaF-induced apoptosis and glycolysis in human promyelocytic leukemia HL-60 cells. NaF-induced apoptotic cell death is characterized by caspase activation, internucleosomal DNA fragmentation, loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, and production of apoptotic bodies. Higher activation of caspases-3 and -9, as compared with that of caspase-8, suggested the involvement of an extrinsic pathway.

To investigate the death mode of cells exposed to CTN, human promyelocytic leukemia (HL-60) cells were chosen to identify the apoptotic process induced by CTN. Morphological evidence of apoptosis, including nuclei fragmentation and DNA laddering formation, was clearly observed 24h after exposure to CTN. Flow cytometry analysis revealed that apoptotic cells in the hypodiploid region dramatically increased in cultures treated with CTN at concentrations above 50muM. Results of Western blotting showed that CTN induced the formation of processed caspase-3, -6, -7, -9, but not caspase-8, in a dose-dependent manner; CTN also induced a time-dependent increase in caspase-3 catalytic activity. The apoptosis triggered by CTN in HL-60 was accompanied by the cytochrome c release from mitochondria to cytoplasm. The presence of antioxidants in cultures did not effectively suppress CTN-induced cytotoxicity and caspase-3 activity. These findings suggest that CTN induces apoptosis in HL-60 cells by stimulating cytochrome c release followed by activation of multiple caspases, but oxidative stress may not play a role in the apoptotic process.","['Yu, Feng-Yih', 'Liao, Yi-Chun', 'Chang, Chia-Hao', 'Liu, Biing-Hui']","['Yu FY', 'Liao YC', 'Chang CH', 'Liu BH']","['Chung Shan Medical University, Department of Life Sciences, No. 110, Sec. 1, Chien-Kuo N.

Bufalin also induces differentiation of leukemia cells alone or in combination with other differentiation inducers including 1alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D(3) [1,25(OH)(2)D(3)]. In this study, we performed a transient cotransfection assay using a vitamin D receptor (VDR) expression vector and a luciferase reporter and found that although bufalin did not transactivate the VDR, it effectively enhanced VDR activity induced by 1,25(OH)(2)D(3). Bufalin also augmented VDR activation by bile acid ligands, such as lithocholic acid and 3-ketocholanic acid. Other cardiotonic steroids including ouabain, digitoxigenin and cinobufagin did not enhance VDR activation. Bufalin did not bind directly to VDR but did modulate the interaction of VDR and cofactors, such as steroid receptor coactivator-1 and nuclear receptor corepressor. Bufalin treatment significantly increased the expression of an endogenous VDR target gene, CYP24, in kidney- and monocyte-derived cell lines treated with 1,25(OH)(2)D(3). The data indicate that bufalin-mediated cellular mechanisms such as interaction with Na(+), K(+)-ATPase may affect VDR transcriptional activity. Bufalin may be a useful tool in the investigation of VDR regulation by membrane-originating cellular signals and of pathophysiological mechanisms linking VDR to cardiovascular dysfunction.","['Nakano, Hiroyuki', 'Matsunawa, Manabu', 'Yasui, Atsutaka', 'Adachi, Ryutaro', 'Kawana, Katsuyoshi', 'Shimomura, Iichiro', 'Makishima, Makoto']","['Nakano H', 'Matsunawa M', 'Yasui A', 'Adachi R', 'Kawana K', 'Shimomura I', 'Makishima M']","['Graduate School of Frontier Biosciences, Osaka University, Osaka 565-0871, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Biochem Pharmacol,Biochemical pharmacology,0101032,IM,"['Amphibian Venoms/chemistry/isolation & purification', 'Animals', 'Anura', 'Bufanolides/chemistry/isolation & purification/*pharmacology', 'Calcitriol/pharmacology', 'Cardiac Glycosides/chemistry/isolation & purification/*pharmacology', 'Cell Line', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Interactions', 'Drug Synergism', 'Drug Therapy, Combination', 'Furylfuramide/chemistry/pharmacology', 'Gene Expression/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Isotope Labeling/methods', '*Ligands', 'Luciferases/drug effects/pharmacology', 'Medicine, Chinese Traditional', 'Receptors, Calcitriol/*drug effects/genetics/metabolism', 'Steroid Hydroxylases/biosynthesis/chemistry/genetics', 'Transcriptional Activation/*drug effects/physiology', 'Vitamin D3 24-Hydroxylase']",2005/09/27 09:00,2005/12/24 09:00,['2005/09/27 09:00'],"['2005/07/29 00:00 [received]', '2005/08/24 00:00 [revised]', '2005/08/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2005/09/27 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/12/24 09:00 [medline]', '2005/09/27 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Biochem Pharmacol. 2005 Nov 15;70(10):1479-86. doi: 10.1016/j.bcp.2005.08.012.

During the past 35 years, the role of HSCT has changed from an experimental procedure for terminally ill patients to a curative treatment. In 2003, 1170 procedures were registered in Italy (Italian Group for Blood and Marrow Transplantation). The main reported indications were as follows: leukemia, lymphoproliferative diseases, myelodysplasia, and nonmalignant diseases such as thalassemia and severe aplastic anemia. Important changes have been observed in the last 5 years: the shift from bone marrow to peripheral blood as the SC source, the increasing number of alternative donors such as unrelated, partially matched family donors and cord blood SC, and the new extra-hematological indications including solid tumors. Moreover, the development of nonmyeloablative conditioning regimens have allowed physicians to perform HSCT in patients with advanced age or important comorbidities. In contrast, the availability of the Tyrosine kinase inhibitor (STI-571) for treatment of patients affected by chronic myelogenous leukemia, which was formerly the main indication for HSCT, has produced a dramatic decrease in the number of transplantations in this setting. HSCT performed in the early phases of disease and in young patients offers more than a 50% cure rate. The transplant-related mortality still represents the greatest obstacle, ranging from 20%-30%, despite the less toxic conditioning regimens, high-resolution HLA typing, and better supportive care. GvHD and infections remain the main causes of morbidity. As regards relapses, they correlate with disease status at the time of transplantation.

These were: cell proliferation, nuclear damage, activation of cytokines, and numbers of total leukocytes of CD34+ hematopoietic blood stem cells and of CD4+ and CD8+ lymphocytes. Additionally, antioxidative capacity of blood plasma, uric acid, and hemoglobin levels were measured. Blood samples of 67 healthy donors were used as controls. RESULTS: In vivo and in vitro irradiations showed comparable results. A dose-response relationship was found for most parameters. Three parameters were associated with severe acute oral mucositis (Grade 3 or 4 vs. Grade 0 to 2): leukocytes fewer than 6200/microL after 4 Gy TBI, a rate of >19% lymphocytes with reduced DNA and protein content (""necroses"") after 4 Gy in vitro irradiation, and a small antioxidative capacity in blood plasma (<0.68 mMol) after 8 Gy TBI. CONCLUSION: Three simple blood assays were associated with oral mucositis that are posed here hypothetically as an early symptom of enhanced radiosensitivity in leukemic patients: leukocyte count, damaged lymphocyte score, and the antioxidative capacity after exposure.","['Severin, Erhard', 'Greve, Burkhard', 'Pascher, Elke', 'Wedemeyer, Niels', 'Hacker-Klom, Ursula', 'Silling, Gerda', 'Kienast, Joachim', 'Willich, Normann', 'Gohde, Wolfgang']","['Severin E', 'Greve B', 'Pascher E', 'Wedemeyer N', 'Hacker-Klom U', 'Silling G', 'Kienast J', 'Willich N', 'Gohde W']","['Institute of Radiation Biology, University Hospital, Munster, Germany. severie@uni-muenster.de']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys,"International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics",7603616,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Cell Cycle/radiation effects', 'Cytokines/blood', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Radiation', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Female', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/radiation effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*blood/*radiotherapy', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Lymphocyte Count', 'Lymphocytes/pathology/*radiation effects', 'Lymphoma/blood/*radiotherapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mouth Mucosa/radiation effects', 'Mucositis/blood/*etiology', 'Prospective Studies', 'Radiation Tolerance/*physiology', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism', 'Sex Factors', 'Uric Acid/blood', 'Whole-Body Irradiation']",2005/09/27 09:00,2006/03/24 09:00,['2005/09/27 09:00'],"['2004/11/30 00:00 [received]', '2005/06/02 00:00 [revised]', '2005/06/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2005/09/27 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/03/24 09:00 [medline]', '2005/09/27 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 2006 Jan 1;64(1):242-50. doi: 10.1016/j.ijrobp.2005.06.020.

Two case studies of children illustrate different approaches-one that aggressively applies all possible technologies to maximize chances of survival and another that focuses on the patient's overall quality of life and on healing rather than curing. The cases highlight characteristics of an integrated model of palliative care to address clinical, moral, and ethical uncertainties. This model integrates being with doing, provides for developing attunement and presence as capacities for being with children and their parents, and addresses challenges in the healthcare environment. Strategies for integrating palliative care into pediatric practice include listening, fostering respect for the child and parents across the organization, nurturing collaborative connections, managing uncertainty, tolerating ambiguity, making peace with conflict, and committing to self-care.

A major benzene metabolite is p-benzoquinone (pBQ), which can damage DNA by forming the exocyclic base adducts pBQ-dC, pBQ-dA, and pBQ-dG in vitro. To gain insights into the role of pBQ in benzene genotoxicity, we examined in vitro translesion synthesis and in vivo mutagenesis of these pBQ adducts. Purified REV1 and Polkappa were essentially incapable of translesion synthesis in response to the pBQ adducts. Opposite pBQ-dA and pBQ-dC, purified human Poliota was capable of error-prone nucleotide insertion, but was unable to perform extension synthesis. Error-prone translesion synthesis was observed with Poleta. However, DNA synthesis largely stopped opposite the lesion. Consistent with in vitro results, replication of site-specifically damaged plasmids was strongly inhibited by pBQ adducts in yeast cells, which depended on both Polzeta and Poleta. In wild-type cells, the majority of translesion products were deletions at the site of damage, accounting for 91%, 90%, and 76% for pBQ-dA, pBQ-dG, and pBQ-dC, respectively. These results show that the pBQ-dC, pBQ-dA, and pBQ-dG adducts are strong blocking lesions, and are highly mutagenic by predominantly inducing deletion mutations. These results are consistent with the lesion structures predicted by molecular dynamics simulation. Our results led to the following model. Translesion synthesis normally occurs by directly copying the lesion site through base insertion and extension synthesis. When the lesion becomes incompatible in accommodating a base opposite the lesion in DNA, translesion synthesis occurs by a less efficient lesion loop-out mechanism, resulting in avoiding copying the damaged base and leading to deletion.","['Xie, Zhongwen', 'Zhang, Yangbin', 'Guliaev, Anton B', 'Shen, Huiyun', 'Hang, Bo', 'Singer, B', 'Wang, Zhigang']","['Xie Z', 'Zhang Y', 'Guliaev AB', 'Shen H', 'Hang B', 'Singer B', 'Wang Z']","['Graduate Center for Toxicology, University of Kentucky, Lexington, 40536, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",Netherlands,DNA Repair (Amst),DNA repair,101139138,IM,"['Benzene/*pharmacology/toxicity', 'Benzoquinones/*chemistry', 'Carcinogens/pharmacology/toxicity', 'DNA Adducts/chemistry/*genetics/*metabolism', 'DNA Damage/drug effects', 'DNA-Directed DNA Polymerase/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', '*Mutagenesis/drug effects', 'Mutagenesis, Insertional', 'Mutagens/pharmacology/toxicity', 'Mutation/drug effects/*genetics', 'Nuclear Proteins', 'Nucleotidyltransferases/metabolism', 'Yeasts/metabolism']",2005/09/27 09:00,2006/02/04 09:00,['2005/09/27 09:00'],"['2005/09/27 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/02/04 09:00 [medline]', '2005/09/27 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,DNA Repair (Amst). 2005 Dec 8;4(12):1399-409. doi: 10.1016/j.dnarep.2005.08.012.

VAR-B has been shown previously to possess potent pro-apoptotic activity. This study was undertaken to investigate the mechanism of action of chemically synthesised VAR-B and its analogue deoxy-variolin B (dVAR-B). In different human cancer cell lines both compounds inhibited colony formation, caused cell cycle perturbations and induced apoptosis at concentrations ranging from 0.1 to 2 microM. LoVo/Dx cells over-expressing Pgp were equally sensitive as the parental cell line to VAR-B and dVAR-B, indicating that variolins are not substrates of Pgp. Although variolins induced an increase in the levels of p53 with an increase in p21, their cytotoxicities did not appear to be dependent on p53 status as their potency was comparable in cells with wild-type p53, or in sub-lines with inactivated p53. Both VAR-B and dVAR-B prevent the cells from entering S phase, blocking cells in G1 and cause an accumulation of cells in G2. The apoptosis induced by VAR-B and dVAR-B occurs very rapidly in some cell lines (e.g., Jurkat leukaemia cells) and is already evident 4h after the beginning of treatment. Although intercalation of dVAR-B in DNA has been demonstrated, neither VAR-B nor dVAR-B produce detectable breaks in DNA. These results are consistent with the in vitro biochemical assays that also demonstrated that dVAR-B is not topoisomerase I or II poison. Instead, each of these variolins appears to inhibit cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) in the muM range. CDK1-cyclin B, CDK2-cyclin A and CDK2/cylin E complexes were inhibited in a range of concentrations lower than those required to inhibit the activity of CDK4/cyclin D or CDK7/cyclin H complexes. In conclusion, these variolins are a new class of CDK inhibitors that activate apoptosis in a p53-independent fashion and thus they may be effective against tumours with p53 mutations or deletions.","['Simone, Matteo', 'Erba, Eugenio', 'Damia, Giovanna', 'Vikhanskaya, Faina', 'Di Francesco, Angela M', 'Riccardi, Riccardo', 'Bailly, Christian', 'Cuevas, Carmen', 'Fernandez Sousa-Faro, Jose Maria', ""D'Incalci, Maurizio""]","['Simone M', 'Erba E', 'Damia G', 'Vikhanskaya F', 'Di Francesco AM', 'Riccardi R', 'Bailly C', 'Cuevas C', 'Fernandez Sousa-Faro JM', ""D'Incalci M""]","['Department of Oncology, Mario Negri Institute for Pharmacological Research, Via Eritrea 62, Milan, and Division of Pediatric Oncology, Catholic University A.

In addition, soluble B7 proteins, minus their transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains, have been shown to block the down regulation of T-cell activation through blockade of B7/CTLA-4 interactions in mouse tumor models. Recently, we developed swinepox virus (SPV) vectors for delivery of feline leukemia antigens for vaccine use in cats [Winslow, B.J., Cochran, M.D., Holzenburg, A., Sun, J., Junker, D.E., Collisson, E.W., 2003. Replication and expression of a swinepox virus vector delivering feline leukemia virus Gag and Env to cell lines of swine and feline origin. Virus Res. 98, 1-15]. To explore the use of feline B7.1 and B7.2 ligands as nonchemical adjuvants, SPV vectors containing full-length feline B7.1 and B7.2 ligands were constructed and analyzed. Full-length feline B7.1 and B7.2 produced from SPV vectors were natively processed and costimulated Jurkat cells to produce IL-2, in vitro. In addition, we explored the feasibility of utilizing SPV as a novel expression vector to produce soluble forms of feline B7.1 (sB7.1) and B7.2 (sB7.2) in tissue culture. The transmembrane and cytoplasmic regions of the B7.1 and B7.2 genes were replaced with a poly-histidine tag and purified via a two-step chromatography procedure. Receptor binding and costimulation activity was measured. Although feline sB7.1-his and sB7.2-his proteins bound to the human homolog receptors, CTLA-4 and CD28, both soluble ligands possessed greater affinity for CTLA-4, compared to CD28. However, both retained the ability to partially block CD28-mediated costimulation in vitro. Results from these studies establish the use of SPV as a mammalian expression vector and suggest that full-length-vectored and purified soluble feline B7 ligands may be valuable, nonchemical immune-modulators.","['Winslow, Barbara J', 'Kalabat, Dalia Y', 'Brown, Scott M', 'Cochran, Mark D', 'Collisson, Ellen W']","['Winslow BJ', 'Kalabat DY', 'Brown SM', 'Cochran MD', 'Collisson EW']","['Schering-Plough Animal Health Corporation, San Diego, CA 92121, USA. bjwinslow@adelphia.net']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Netherlands,Vet Microbiol,Veterinary microbiology,7705469,IM,"['*Adjuvants, Immunologic', 'Animals', 'Antigens, CD', 'Antigens, Differentiation', 'B7-1 Antigen/genetics/*immunology', 'B7-2 Antigen/genetics/*immunology', 'CTLA-4 Antigen', 'Cats', 'Cell Line', 'Gene Products, env/metabolism', 'Gene Products, gag/metabolism', 'Genetic Vectors', 'Humans', 'Immunoconjugates', 'Interleukin-2/biosynthesis', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Leukemia, Feline/prevention & control', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Poxviridae Infections/immunology/*veterinary', 'Suipoxvirus/*immunology', 'Virus Replication']",2005/09/27 09:00,2006/06/13 09:00,['2005/09/27 09:00'],"['2004/04/21 00:00 [received]', '2005/02/04 00:00 [revised]', '2005/06/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2005/09/27 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/06/13 09:00 [medline]', '2005/09/27 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Vet Microbiol. 2005 Nov 30;111(1-2):1-13. doi: 10.1016/j.vetmic.2005.06.008.

By EMSA and ChIP assays, we further demonstrate that, while both VDR and RAR are bound to the RARbeta promoter in NB4 cells, addition of 1,25D3 increases VDR binding to this promoter, while that of RA induces the release of VDR and increases the binding of RAR. Thus, contrary to normal myeloid cells, 1,25D3 does not act as a transrepressor of RA transcriptional activity in leukemic cells, suggesting that transcriptional regulation of RA-target genes may be modified in malignant cells.

In clinical medicine, this property has been employed to reconstitute an individual's diseased hematopoietic system following ablation with a healthy, normal-functioning hematopoietic system by performing autologous and allogeneic stem cell transplantations. However, despite the widespread utilization of these pragmatic procedures for multiple human bone marrow diseases, much about the basic biology of the HSC and related primitive cells, such as the ontogenic origin of the HSC, the identification of the putative hemangioblast, and the potential of the HSC to contribute to alternative tissues, remains elusive. Basic scientists continue to investigate actively the origin of HSCs during mammalian ontogeny, the stimuli that induce HSCs to divide and differentiate normally, the relationship of HSCs to hemangioblasts, and the potential capacity of HSCs to transdifferentiate to other tissues such as endoderm-derived liver cells and ectoderm-derived neurons. This article will summarize the historical salient studies that have characterized the HSC and will review the active research currently being conducted to understand and define further the biologic properties and potential faculties of HSCs.

IFNs have impacted positively on both quality and quantity of life for hundreds of thousands of cancer patients with chronic leukemia, lymphoma, bladder carcinoma, melanoma, and renal carcinoma. The role of the IFN system in malignant pathogenesis continues to enhance understanding of how the IFN system may be modulated for therapeutic advantage. Reaching the full potential of IFNs as therapeutics for cancer will also result from additional understanding of the genes underlying apoptosis induction, angiogenesis inhibition, and influence on immunologic function. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval of IFNs occurred less than 20 years ago; after 40 years, third-generation products of early cytotoxics, such as 5- fluorouracil (5FU), are beginning to reach clinical approval. Thus, substantial potential exists for additional application of IFNs and IFN inducers as anticancer therapeutics, particularly when one considers that their pleiotropic cellular and molecular effects have yet to be fully defined.","['Borden, Ernest C']",['Borden EC'],"['Center for Cancer Drug Discovery & Development, Lerner Research Institute, Taussig Cancer Center/R40, Cleveland, OH 44195, USA. bordene@ccf.org']",['eng'],"['Lecture', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Interferon Cytokine Res,Journal of interferon & cytokine research : the official journal of the International Society for Interferon and Cytokine Research,9507088,IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Gene Expression/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Interferon-alpha/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Interferon-beta/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Mice', 'Neoplasms/blood supply/*drug therapy/genetics', 'Neovascularization, Pathologic/drug therapy']",2005/09/27 09:00,2005/11/01 09:00,['2005/09/27 09:00'],"['2005/09/27 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/11/01 09:00 [medline]', '2005/09/27 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Interferon Cytokine Res. 2005 Sep;25(9):511-27. doi: 10.1089/jir.2005.25.511.,"['R01 CA89544/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA90914/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Interferon-alpha)', '77238-31-4 (Interferon-beta)']",,['10.1089/jir.2005.25.511 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

For optimal performance, it accepts samples coming from the class used for training and rejects all samples from other classes. We evaluate six OC classifiers: the Gaussian model, Parzen windows, support vector data description (with two types of kernels: inner product and Gaussian), nearest neighbor data description, K-means, and PCA on three gene-expression profile data sets, those being an SRBCT data set, a Colon data set, and a Leukemia data set. Providing there is a good splitting of training and test samples and feature selection, most OC classifiers can produce high quality results. Parzen windows and support vector data description are ""over-strict"" in most cases, while nearest neighbor data description is ""over-loose"". Other classifiers are intermediate between these two extremes. The main difficulty for the OC classifier is it is difficult to obtain an optimum decision threshold if there are a limited number of training samples.","['Xu, Yun', 'Brereton, Richard G']","['Xu Y', 'Brereton RG']","[""School of Chemistry, University of Bristol, Cantock's Close, Bristol BS8 1TS, United Kingdom.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Chem Inf Model,Journal of chemical information and modeling,101230060,IM,"['Colon/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Profiling/*methods', 'Multigene Family', 'Neoplasms/genetics/pathology', 'Pattern Recognition, Automated/*methods', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Software']",2005/09/27 09:00,2005/12/24 09:00,['2005/09/27 09:00'],"['2005/09/27 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/12/24 09:00 [medline]', '2005/09/27 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Chem Inf Model. 2005 Sep-Oct;45(5):1392-401. doi: 10.1021/ci049726v.,,,,['10.1021/ci049726v [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Clinical symptoms related to neoplasia consisted of a poor nutritional state, anaemia, mild to moderate dehydration and apathy. Paresis was apparent in three mice inoculated with 12B1 cells. Necropsy revealed splenomegaly in all animals. Sporadic haemorrhages in the lungs and enlargement of some lymph nodes were seen in some of the animals. Histological examination showed neoplastic cells in the spleen, in the bone marrow of the sternum, in the lung interstitium and in sinusoids of the liver in all mice. In six of nine brains examined, mild to moderate infiltration by neoplastic cells was observed. In all but two mice mild infiltration of the kidneys was found. The enlargement of lymph nodes was caused by an accumulation of neoplastic cells. The paresis was due to neoplastic infiltration of the vertebra, epidural space and spinal roots. Staining with Sudan black revealed cytoplasmic granules in neoplastic cells; however, the peroxidase reaction was negative. Numerous neoplastic cells disseminated in the red pulp of the spleen were reactive with CD3, CD79beta, CD11b and with neutrophil antibodies.

In vivo, the distribution of AgNORs was studied in early granulocytic precursors of patients suffering from chronic myeloid leukaemia who were both untreated and treated with imatinib mesylate. AgNORs were visualized by silver reaction under conditions which facilitated to see their distribution by light microscopy. In vitro, the distribution of AgNORs was studied in proliferating and ageing K 562 cells which originated from chronic myeloid leukaemia. In vitro, the ageing of K 562 cells produced intranucleolar translocation of AgNORs to the nucleolar periphery. Such translocation was also observed in some leukaemic early granulocytic precursors in vivo, e.g. in bone marrow myeloblasts and promyelocytes of leukaemic patients. As was expected, the intranucleolar translocation of AgNORs in early granulocytic precursors was more frequent in patients treated with the cytostatic therapy--imanitib mesylate. The abovementioned findings suggest that myeloblasts and promyelocytes with AgNORs translocated to the periphery of large nucleoli might be in the ageing state, similarly as blastic cells of leukaemic myeloid origin (K 562 cells) in ageing cultures. Thus, the translocation of AgNORs might be a useful marker of premature ageing in the future and might contribute to the evaluation of the single cell state under various experimental as well as clinical conditions. However, more clinically oriented studies are required in this direction.","['Smetana, K', 'Klamova, H', 'Pluskalova, M', 'Stockbauer, P', 'Jiraskova, I', 'Hrkal, Z']","['Smetana K', 'Klamova H', 'Pluskalova M', 'Stockbauer P', 'Jiraskova I', 'Hrkal Z']","['Institute of Haematology and Blood Transfusion, Prague, Czech Republic. karel.smetana@uhkt.cz']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Czech Republic,Folia Biol (Praha),Folia biologica,0234640,IM,"['Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Nucleolus/*pathology/ultrastructure', 'Cellular Senescence', 'Granulocyte Precursor Cells/*pathology/ultrastructure', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*pathology', 'Nucleolus Organizer Region/*pathology/ultrastructure', 'Silver Staining']",2005/09/27 09:00,2005/12/13 09:00,['2005/09/27 09:00'],"['2005/09/27 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/12/13 09:00 [medline]', '2005/09/27 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Folia Biol (Praha). 2005;51(4):89-92.,,,,['FB2005A0017 [pii]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Six genes are located in the quantitative multiplex PCR-defined 0.6 Mb minimal region of gain at 6p22 (DEK, AOF1, TPMT, NHLRC1, KIF13A, and NUP153), and E2F3 is 2 Mb away from the minimal region of gain on 6p22. E2F3, DEK, KIF13A, and NUP153 were most frequently overexpressed in retinoblastoma with 6p genomic gain, compared with the normal adult human retina. E2F3 and DEK mRNA levels were increased in all human tumors showing 6p22 gain, as well as in mouse retinoblastoma induced by SV40 large T antigen expression in developing retina, compared with the normal controls (adult human retina and 7-day-old mouse retina, respectively). Only DEK showed statistically significant correlation of expression and genomic copy number (P = 0.019). E2F3 and DEK, but not NUP153, showed developmental regulation. E2F3 and DEK mRNA overexpression was always associated with protein overexpression, determined by immunoblotting or immunofluorescent staining of primary tumors, relative to the adjacent normal retina. E2F3 was strongly expressed in actively proliferating cells, while DEK was overexpressed in all tumor cells. Taking into account the proliferation-promoting role of E2F3, implication of E2F3 in bladder and prostate cancer, and the translocation and overexpression of DEK in leukemia, we conclude that either DEK or E2F3 (or both) are targeted by the 6p22 gain in retinoblastoma.","['Orlic, Marija', 'Spencer, Clarellen E', 'Wang, Lisa', 'Gallie, Brenda L']","['Orlic M', 'Spencer CE', 'Wang L', 'Gallie BL']","['Department of Molecular and Medical Genetics, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Genes Chromosomes Cancer,"Genes, chromosomes & cancer",9007329,IM,"['Adult', 'Animals', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Chromosomal Proteins, Non-Histone/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 6/*genetics', 'E2F3 Transcription Factor/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Gene Dosage', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Humans', 'Kinesins/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Oncogene Proteins/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Poly-ADP-Ribose Binding Proteins', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis', 'Retina/metabolism', 'Retinal Neoplasms/*genetics/metabolism', 'Retinoblastoma/*genetics/metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction']",2005/09/24 09:00,2006/03/16 09:00,['2005/09/24 09:00'],"['2005/09/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/03/16 09:00 [medline]', '2005/09/24 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Genes Chromosomes Cancer. 2006 Jan;45(1):72-82. doi: 10.1002/gcc.20263.,,"['0 (Chromosomal Proteins, Non-Histone)', '0 (Dek protein, human)', '0 (E2F3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (E2F3 protein, human)', '0 (E2f3 protein, mouse)', '0 (KIF13A protein, human)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Poly-ADP-Ribose Binding Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', 'EC 3.6.4.4 (Kinesins)']",,['10.1002/gcc.20263 [doi]'],,"['Copyright 2005 Wiley-Liss, Inc']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: A quasi-equilibrium solution to the system of ordinary differential equations that describe the kinetics of TMDD was obtained. Computer simulations of the equilibrium model were carried out to generate plasma concentration-time profiles resulting from a large range of intravenous bolus doses. Additionally, the final model was fitted to previously published pharmacokinetic profiles of leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), a cytokine that seems to exhibit TMDD, following intravenous administration of 12.5, 25, 100, 250, 500, or 750 microg/kg in sheep. RESULTS: Simulations show that pharmacokinetic profiles display steeper distribution phases for lower doses and similar terminal disposition phases, but with slight underestimation at early time points as theoretically expected. The final model well-described LIF pharmacokinetics, and the final parameters, which were estimated with relatively good precision, were in good agreement with literature values. CONCLUSIONS: An equilibrium model of TMDD is developed that recapitulates the essential features of the full general model and eliminates the need for estimating drug-binding microconstants that are often difficult or impossible to identify from typical in vivo pharmacokinetic data.","['Mager, Donald E', 'Krzyzanski, Wojciech']","['Mager DE', 'Krzyzanski W']","['Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, University at Buffalo, State University of New York, Buffalo, New York, 14260, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Pharm Res,Pharmaceutical research,8406521,IM,"['Algorithms', 'Animals', 'Computer Simulation', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', '*Drug Delivery Systems', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-6/pharmacokinetics', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', '*Models, Biological', '*Pharmacokinetics', 'Sheep', 'Time Factors']",2005/09/24 09:00,2005/12/15 09:00,['2005/09/24 09:00'],"['2005/04/01 00:00 [received]', '2005/06/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2005/09/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/12/15 09:00 [medline]', '2005/09/24 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Pharm Res. 2005 Oct;22(10):1589-96. doi: 10.1007/s11095-005-6650-0.

Since HBP1 exhibits tumor-suppressor activity in nonmyeloid tissues, we examined the effects of ectopic overexpression of HBP1 upon the growth and differentiation of myeloid cells. We prepared transient and stable transfectants of the myeloblast cell line K562, which overexpress HBP1 mRNA and protein. HBP1 transfectants displayed slower growth in cell culture and reduced colony formation in soft agar, retardation of S-phase progression, reduced expression of cyclin D1 and D3 mRNAs and increased expression of p21 mRNA. HBP1 transfectants also underwent increased apoptosis, as demonstrated by morphology and binding of Annexin V. Fas ligand mRNA levels were increased in HBP1 transfectants, suggesting involvement of the Fas/Fas ligand pathway. HBP1 overexpression enhanced differentiation of K562 cells towards erythroid and megakaryocyte lineages, as evidenced by increased hemoglobin and CD41a expression. Overexpression of HBP1 modulated mRNA levels for myeloid-specific transcription factors C/EBPalpha, c-Myb, c-Myc, and JunB, as well as lineage-specific transcription factors PU.1, GATA-1, and RUNX1.

Previously known as polymorphic reticulosis or angiocentric T-cell lymphomas, they are classified by the World Health Organization as NK/T-cell lymphoma, nasal type and aggressive NK-cell leukemia. They are prevalent in Asia and South America, but exceptionally rare in western countries. Pathologically, NK-cell lymphomas show a polymorphic neoplastic infiltrate with an angioinvasive and angiodestructive pattern. Lymphoma cells are characteristically CD2+, CD56+ and cytoplasmic CD3epsilon+. T-cell receptor gene is germline, and clonal Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection is almost invariably. Clinically, they can be divided into nasal, non-nasal, and aggressive lymphoma/leukemia subtypes. Most nasal NK-cell lymphomas present with stage I/II disease, and frontline radiotherapy is the most important key to successful treatment. Many stage I/II patients treated with radiotherapy fail systemically, implying that concomitant chemotherapy may be needed. Chemotherapy is indicated for advanced nasal NK-cell lymphoma, and the non-nasal and aggressive subtypes. However, treatment results are unsatisfactory. High-dose chemotherapy with hematopoietic stem cell transplantation may be beneficial to selected patients. The International Prognostic Index and presentation EBV DNA load is of prognostic significance and may be useful in the stratification of patients for various treatment modalities.","['Kwong, Y-L']",['Kwong YL'],"['Department of Medicine, University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China. ylkwong@hkucc.hku.hk']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Combined Modality Therapy', 'Herpesvirus 4, Human', 'Humans', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*pathology', '*Leukemia/classification/diagnosis/therapy', '*Lymphoma/classification/diagnosis/therapy', 'Treatment Outcome']",2005/09/24 09:00,2006/01/20 09:00,['2005/09/24 09:00'],"['2005/09/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/01/20 09:00 [medline]', '2005/09/24 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2005 Dec;19(12):2186-94. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2403955.,,,83,"['2403955 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.leu.2403955 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The signalling pathways of apoptin-induced, cancer cell-selective apoptosis are not well understood. Here, we demonstrate that apoptin triggers apoptosis by activating the mitochondrial/intrinsic pathway, and that it acts independently of the death receptor/extrinsic pathway. Jurkat cells deficient in either FADD or caspase-8 (which are both necessary for the extrinsic pathway) were equally as sensitive to apoptin as their parental clones. This demonstrates that apoptin is likely to act through the mitochondrial death pathway. Apoptin treatment causes a loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, and release of the mitochondrial proteins cytochrome c and apoptosis-inducing factor. Apoptin-induced cell death is counteracted by the anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family members, Bcl-2 itself and Bcl-XL, as shown in Jurkat leukaemia cells. In addition, we describe the processing and activation of caspase-3. By contrast, cleavage of caspase-8, which is predominantly triggered by the death receptor pathway, is not observed. Furthermore, apoptin triggers the cytoplasmic translocation of Nur77, and the inhibition of Nur77 expression by siRNA significantly protects MCF7 cells from apoptin-triggered cell death. Thus, our data indicate that the apoptin death signal(s) ultimately converges at the mitochondria, and that it acts independently of the death receptor pathway.","['Maddika, Subbareddy', 'Booy, Evan P', 'Johar, Dina', 'Gibson, Spencer B', 'Ghavami, Saeid', 'Los, Marek']","['Maddika S', 'Booy EP', 'Johar D', 'Gibson SB', 'Ghavami S', 'Los M']","['Manitoba Institute of Cell Biology, CancerCare Manitoba, University of Manitoba, Winnipeg, MB R3E OV9, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,J Cell Sci,Journal of cell science,0052457,IM,"['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing/genetics/metabolism', 'Animals', 'Apoptosis/physiology', 'Apoptosis Inducing Factor/metabolism', 'Capsid Proteins/metabolism/*toxicity', 'Caspase 3', 'Caspase 8', 'Caspases/genetics/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Nucleus/metabolism', 'Cytochromes c/metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Fas-Associated Death Domain Protein', 'Humans', 'Membrane Potentials/*physiology', 'Mitochondria/*metabolism', 'Neoplasms/*metabolism', 'Nuclear Receptor Subfamily 4, Group A, Member 1', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/genetics/metabolism', 'RNA, Small Interfering/genetics/metabolism', 'Receptors, Cytoplasmic and Nuclear/genetics/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Steroid/genetics/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/*physiology', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/*metabolism', 'bcl-X Protein/genetics/metabolism']",2005/09/24 09:00,2006/01/28 09:00,['2005/09/24 09:00'],"['2005/09/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/01/28 09:00 [medline]', '2005/09/24 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Cell Sci. 2005 Oct 1;118(Pt 19):4485-93. doi: 10.1242/jcs.02580.,,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (Apoptosis Inducing Factor)', '0 (Capsid Proteins)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (FADD protein, human)', '0 (Fas-Associated Death Domain Protein)', '0 (NR4A1 protein, human)', '0 (Nuclear Receptor Subfamily 4, Group A, Member 1)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (Receptors, Cytoplasmic and Nuclear)', '0 (Receptors, Steroid)', '0 (Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (VP3 protein, Chicken anemia virus)', '0 (bcl-X Protein)', '9007-43-6 (Cytochromes c)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP8 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 8)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",,"['118/19/4485 [pii]', '10.1242/jcs.02580 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We applied novel technologies, such as stimulation of CLL cells either with CD40 ligand or with a combination of CpG-oligodeoxynucleotides and IL-2, to increase the frequency of metaphase spreads for detailed chromosome analysis in 96 patients with CLL. This approach revealed that translocations occurred in 33 of 96 (34%) of our patients with CLL. The presence of translocations defined a new prognostic subgroup because these patients have significantly shorter median treatment-free survival (24 months vs 106 months; P < .001) and significantly inferior overall survival (OS; median, 94 months) than patients without translocations (346 months; P < .001). In multivariate analysis-including Binet stage, complex karyotype, CD38 expression, and 17p deletions-translocation proved to be the prognostic marker with the highest impact for an unfavorable clinical outcome (P < .001).

PNAs share similar chemical structure and mechanism of action. Several mechanisms could be responsible for their cytotoxicity both in proliferating and quiescent cells, such as inhibition of DNA synthesis, inhibition of DNA repair and accumulation of DNA strand breaks. Induction of apoptosis through the mitochondrial pathway, direct binding to apoptosome or modulation of p53 expression all lead to apoptosis, which is the main end-point of PNA action. However, individual PNAs exhibit significant differences, especially in their interaction with enzymes involved in adenosine and deoxyadenosine metabolism. Synergistic interactions between PNAs and other cytotoxic agents (alkylating agents, anthracycline antitumor antibiotics, cytarabine, monoclonal antibodies) have been demonstrated in both preclinical and clinical studies. PNAs are highly effective in chronic lymphoid leukemias and low grade B- and T-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphomas, including Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia. DCF and 2-CdA are currently the drugs of choice in hairy cell leukemia. Moreover, clinical studies have confirmed the efficacy of PNAs alone or in combination protocols in the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia and myelodysplastic syndromes. Finally, PNAs, especially FA, play an important role in non-myeloablative conditioning regimens for allogenic stem cell transplantation in high-risk patients.

Disease mechanisms can be divided into two main groups; those underlying the increased apoptosis of bone marrow progenitors, and those associated with progressive blast proliferation, and transformation to acute myeloid leukemia. The recently published WHO classification includes one subtype with a specific cytogenetic lesion, the 5q- syndrome, but otherwise classification of MDS is based solely on clinical and morphological criteria. Subsequently, few therapeutic options have been directed towards specific biological or molecular mechanisms in MDS. Progenitor apoptosis in MDS may be initiated by extrinsic and intrinsic mechanisms. The extrinsic pathway includes T-cell mediated bone marrow failure, for which antithymocyte globulin treatment may be an effective, as well as negative effects caused by the marrow microenvironment. New therapeutic options targeting the microenvironment include thalidomide and its analogue, lenalidomide, which has proven extremely effective for patients with 5q- syndrome. The erythroid apoptosis of in particular sideroblastic anemia is mediated by mitochondrial release of cytochrome c, which may be inhibited by treatment with erythropoietin and granulocyte-colony-stimulating-factor. Important mechanisms for disease progression are DNA hypermethylation, histone deacetylation, and possibly RAS mutations. Two new DNA hypomethylating agents, azacytidine and decitabine, have shown efficacy in patients with high-risk MDS, and may prolong time to progression. In conclusion, recent advances in the pathogenetic understanding of MDS have led to significant therapeutic progress.","['Lindberg, Eva Hellstrom']",['Lindberg EH'],"['Karolinska Institutet, Dept of Medicine, Div of Hematology, Karolinska University Hospital Huddinge, 141 86 Stockholm, Sweden. eva.hellstrom-lindberg@medhs.ki.se']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United Arab Emirates,Curr Drug Targets,Current drug targets,100960531,IM,"['Apoptosis', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'Epigenesis, Genetic', 'Erythropoiesis', 'Fibroblasts/physiology', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/therapeutic use', 'Hematopoiesis', 'Humans', 'Mitochondria/physiology', 'Mutation', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/classification/*drug therapy/genetics', 'Prognosis']",2005/09/24 09:00,2005/10/15 09:00,['2005/09/24 09:00'],"['2005/09/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/10/15 09:00 [medline]', '2005/09/24 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Curr Drug Targets. 2005 Sep;6(6):713-25. doi: 10.2174/1389450054863707.,,['143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)'],176,['10.2174/1389450054863707 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

All malignant cells, including leukemias, carry survival advantages compared to their normal counterparts. These survival advantages are particularly evident when the cells face both normal environmental stressors as well as extreme stressors of potentially lethal DNA damage. The impact of such stressors is ultimately determined by the signaling pathways and resultant cellular activation, including alterations in cellular growth, differentiation, survival and death. It is our improving understanding of these signaling pathways, both normal and malignant, that provide the targets for novel therapies.

Experiments with synthetic RAR and RXR agonists and antagonists suggest that RARalpha/RXR heterodimers play a role in the retinoid-stimulated increase in steroid sulfatase activity. The retinoid-driven increase in steroid sulfatase activity was attenuated by inhibition of phospholipase D (PLD), but not by inhibitors of phospholipase C. Experiments with inhibitors of protein kinase C (PKC) show that PKCalpha and PKCdelta play an important role in modulating the retinoid-stimulation of steroid sulfatase activity in HL60 cells. Furthermore, we show that pharmacological inhibition of the RAF-1 and ERK MAP kinases blocked the retinoid-stimulated increase in steroid sulfatase activity in HL60 cells and, by contrast, inhibition of the p38-MAP kinase or JNK-MAP kinase had no effect. Pharmacological inhibitors of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, Akt, and PDK-1 also abrogated the retinoid-stimulated increase in steroid sulfatase activity in HL60 cells.

METHODS: Patients achieving first complete remission (CR1) were selected for their high-risk clinical and/or leukemic features. All patients received two courses of consolidation chemotherapy including one high-dose cytarabine course. Among them, 13 patients in addition received a high-dose melphalan course followed by autologous SCT. Then, all patients received an RIC Allo-SCT combining fludarabine, busulfan, and antithymocyte globulin. RESULTS: All patients engrafted had cumulative incidences of Gluksberg System Grade 2 acute and chronic graft-versus-host-disease (GVHD) of 24 (9-39%) and 64 (48-80%), respectively. Three patients died from nonrelapse causes (NRD) (cumulative incidence: 9%, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0-19) and 6 relapsed (cumulative incidence: 18%, 95% CI: 5-31).

The mechanism(s) by which EBNA-LP functions as a coactivator remains an important question in the biology of EBV-induced B-cell immortalization. In this study, we found that EBNA-LP interacts with the promyelocytic leukemia nuclear body (PML NB)-associated protein Sp100 and displaces Sp100 and heterochromatin protein 1alpha (HP1alpha) from PML NBs. Interaction between EBNA-LP and Sp100 was mediated through conserved region 3 in EBNA-LP and the PML NB targeting domain in Sp100. Overexpression of Sp100 lacking the N-terminal PML NB targeting domain, but not a mutant form of Sp100 lacking the HP1alpha interaction domain, was sufficient to coactivate EBNA2 in a gene-specific manner independent of EBNA-LP. These findings suggest that Sp100 is a major mediator of EBNA-LP coactivation.

Among 50 clusters involving cases of childhood leukemia and lymphoma investigated in the United States in 1961-1977, eight showed suggestive evidence of underlying infectious causation. In seven of the eight communities, case occurrence was associated with the attendance of patients or their siblings at particular schools or with family participation in particular church groups. In five, rapid population growth had occurred. Other findings included the possible association of cases with unusual patterns of infectious disease (rheumatic illness in one community, chickenpox in another) and with other childhood diseases, including other forms of childhood cancer. In one community, two cases of Burkitt's lymphoma occurred at the same time, and a third case arose 3 years later in boys living in a newly developing neighborhood.

A fraction of the total cellular Lyn is associated via its N-terminal unique domain with the cytoplasmic domain of the Fc epsilonRI beta subunit before receptor aggregation. In the current study, we stably transfected the unique domain of Lyn into rat basophilic leukemia-2H3 mast cells and examined the consequences on Fc epsilonRI-induced signal transduction and mediator secretion to further define the role of the unique domain of Lyn in mast cell secretion. Tyrosine phosphorylation of Fc epsilonRI beta and gamma subunits was partially inhibited in the Lyn unique domain transfectants after Ag stimulation. Ag stimulation of Lyn unique domain transfectants was accompanied by enhanced phosphorylation of MEK and ERK-2, which are required for leukotriene C4 (LTC4) release, and production of LTC4 was increased 3- to 5-fold, compared with cells transfected with vector alone. Conversely, tyrosine phosphorylation of the adaptor protein Gab2, which is essential for mast cell degranulation, was inhibited after Ag stimulation of Lyn unique domain transfectants, and Ag-induced release of histamine was inhibited up to 48%. In rat basophilic leukemia-2H3 cells, Lyn thus plays a dual role by positively regulating Fc epsilonRI phosphorylation and degranulation while negatively regulating LTC4 production. This study provides further evidence that the constitutive interaction between the unique domain of Lyn and the Fc epsilonRI beta subunit is a crucial step in the initiation of Fc epsilonRI signaling and that Lyn is limiting for Fc epsilonRI-induced secretion of inflammatory mediators.","['Vonakis, Becky M', 'Gibbons, Scott P Jr', 'Rotte, Masashi J', 'Brothers, Elizabeth A', 'Kim, Seok C', 'Chichester, Kristin', 'MacDonald, Susan M']","['Vonakis BM', 'Gibbons SP Jr', 'Rotte MJ', 'Brothers EA', 'Kim SC', 'Chichester K', 'MacDonald SM']","['Johns Hopkins University Asthma and Allergy Center, Baltimore, MD 21224, USA. bvonaki@jhmi.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,IM,"['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing', 'Animals', 'Calcium/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Membrane/physiology', 'Enzyme Precursors/physiology', 'Histamine/metabolism', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Basophilic, Acute/metabolism', 'Mast Cells/enzymology/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Phosphoproteins/physiology', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary/genetics', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/physiology', 'Rats', 'Receptors, IgE/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/physiology', 'Syk Kinase', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/biosynthesis', 'Tyrosine/metabolism', 'src-Family Kinases/genetics/*physiology']",2005/09/24 09:00,2005/12/13 09:00,['2005/09/24 09:00'],"['2005/09/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/12/13 09:00 [medline]', '2005/09/24 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 2005 Oct 1;175(7):4543-54. doi: 10.4049/jimmunol.175.7.4543.,"['K22 AI49288/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AI32651/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States']","['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (Enzyme Precursors)', '0 (Gab2 protein, rat)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Phosphoproteins)', '0 (Receptors, IgE)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '42HK56048U (Tyrosine)', '820484N8I3 (Histamine)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Syk Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Syk protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Syk protein, rat)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (lyn protein-tyrosine kinase)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (src-Family Kinases)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",,"['175/7/4543 [pii]', '10.4049/jimmunol.175.7.4543 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The abdominal area of 14 day pregnant Swiss albino mice was exposed to 0-1.5 Gy of gamma radiation. Chromosomal aberrations were studied in three passages of spleen colonies (short-term repopulating stem cells, STRSC) derived from 24 h post-irradiation fetal liver cells and in the 1-20 months postpartum bone marrow (long-term repopulating stem cells, LTRSC). Irradiation produced a significant and dose-dependent increase in the aberrant metaphases in the first passage spleen colony (CFU-S1) cells, which decreased in subsequent passages and reached normal levels by the third passage (CFU-S3). Bone marrow at 1-6 months postpartum showed similar chromosomal picture in the 0 Gy control and after 0.5-1.5 Gy, but there was a clear increase in aberrant cells from 9 months postpartum in the irradiated groups. Some mice in all irradiated groups showed a 2.5- to 5-fold increase in peripheral leukocyte counts. Bone marrow of these animals exhibited severe aneuploidy, the chromosome number ranging from less than 1n to 6n at 20 months of age. Our results indicate that unstable chromosome aberrations induced in the fetal haemopoietic STRSC are eliminated during subsequent cell divisions. However, genomic instability induced in the LTRSC persists and is expressed as chromosomal aberrations at advanced ages. Induction of chromosome aneuploidy could be an early step in the chain of events leading to adult leukaemia after prenatal irradiation.","['Devi, P Uma', 'Satyamitra, M']","['Devi PU', 'Satyamitra M']","['Department of Research, Jawaharlal Nehru Cancer Hospital and Research Centre, Idgah Hills, Bhopal, India.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Radiol,The British journal of radiology,0373125,IM,"['Animals', 'Chromosome Aberrations/embryology/radiation effects', 'Female', 'Fetal Development/*radiation effects', 'Fetus/embryology/*radiation effects', '*Genomic Instability', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*radiation effects', 'Male', 'Mice']",2005/09/24 09:00,2005/12/31 09:00,['2005/09/24 09:00'],"['2005/09/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/12/31 09:00 [medline]', '2005/09/24 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Br J Radiol. 2005 Oct;78(934):928-33. doi: 10.1259/bjr/18119329.,,,,"['78/934/928 [pii]', '10.1259/bjr/18119329 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We describe here a group of proteins expressed on the surface of the undifferentiated mouse embryonic stem cell line D3. These proteins were identified using a combination of cell surface labeling with biotin, subcellular fractionation of plasma membranes, and mass spectrometry-based protein identification technology. From 965 unique peptides carrying biotin labels, we assigned 324 proteins including 235 proteins that have putative signal sequences and/or transmembrane segments. Receptors, transporters, and cell adhesion molecules were the major classes of proteins identified. Besides known cell surface markers of embryonic stem cells, such as alkaline phosphatase, the analysis identified 59 clusters of differentiation-related molecules and more than 80 components of multiple cell signaling pathways that are characteristic of a number of different cell lineages. We identified receptors for leukemia-inhibitory factor, interleukin 6, and bone morphogenetic protein, which play critical roles in the maintenance of undifferentiated mouse embryonic stem cells. We also identified receptors for growth factors/cytokines, such as fibroblast growth factor, platelet-derived growth factor, ephrin, Hedgehog, and Wnt, which transduce signals for cell differentiation and embryonic development. Finally we identified a variety of integrins, cell adhesion molecules, and matrix metalloproteases. These results suggest that D3 cells express diverse cell surface proteins that function to maintain pluripotency, enabling cells to respond to various external signals that initiate differentiation into a variety of cell types.","['Nunomura, Kazuto', 'Nagano, Kohji', 'Itagaki, Chiharu', 'Taoka, Masato', 'Okamura, Nobuko', 'Yamauchi, Yoshio', 'Sugano, Sumio', 'Takahashi, Nobuhiro', 'Izumi, Tomonori', 'Isobe, Toshiaki']","['Nunomura K', 'Nagano K', 'Itagaki C', 'Taoka M', 'Okamura N', 'Yamauchi Y', 'Sugano S', 'Takahashi N', 'Izumi T', 'Isobe T']","['Division of Proteomics Research, Institute of Medical Science, Graduate School of Frontier Sciences, University of Tokyo, 4-6-1 Shirokanedai, Minato-ku, Tokyo 108-8639, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Mol Cell Proteomics,Molecular & cellular proteomics : MCP,101125647,IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Automation', 'Base Sequence', 'Biomarkers/analysis', 'Biotinylation', 'Cell Fractionation', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Membrane/*ultrastructure', 'DNA Primers', 'Embryo, Mammalian', 'Mass Spectrometry/methods', 'Membrane Proteins/*chemistry/genetics', 'Mice', 'Peptide Fragments/chemistry', 'Signal Transduction', 'Stem Cells/physiology/*ultrastructure']",2005/09/24 09:00,2006/03/29 09:00,['2005/09/24 09:00'],"['2005/09/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/03/29 09:00 [medline]', '2005/09/24 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Mol Cell Proteomics. 2005 Dec;4(12):1968-76. doi: 10.1074/mcp.M500216-MCP200.

METHODS: The proposed method is based on two assumptions: (1) the number of labelled cells traversing the cell cycle per unit time is constant and (2) the total number of labelled cells is constant throughout the cycle, provided that cells produced after division are excluded. The total numbers of labelled divided G1 cells, labelled divided S cells, labelled undivided S cells, and labelled undivided G2 cells were obtained for DNA histograms of BrdUrd-positive cells in a collected sample. These cell numbers were used to write equations to determine the durations of cell cycle phases, TC and GF. To illustrate the application of the proposed formulae, cell cycle kinetic parameters were analysed in solid SL2 tumours growing in DBA/2 mice and in human T-leukaemia Jurkat cells in culture. RESULTS: The suitability of the proposed method for estimating durations of the cell cycle phases, TC and GF was demonstrated. TC in SL2 tumours was found to be relatively constant at 4 and 10 days after tumour implantation (20.3 +/- 1.1 h and 21.6 +/- 0.9 h, respectively). GF in tumours at day 10 was lower than GF at day 4 (54.2 +/- 7.7% vs. 79.2 +/- 5.9%, p = 0.0003). Approximate values of TC and GF of cultured Jurkat cells were 23.9 h and 79.3%, respectively. CONCLUSION: The proposed method is relatively simple and permits estimation of the cell cycle parameters, including TC and GF, from a single tumour sample after labelling with BrdUrd. We have shown that this method may be useful in preclinical studies, allowing estimation of changes in GF during growth of murine tumours. Experiments with human Jurkat cells suggest that the proposed method might also prove suitable for measurement of cell kinetics in human tumours. Development of suitable software enabling more objective interpretation of the DNA profile in this method would be desirable.","['Eidukevicius, Rimantas', 'Characiejus, Dainius', 'Janavicius, Ramunas', 'Kazlauskaite, Nijole', 'Pasukoniene, Vita', 'Mauricas, Mykolas', 'Den Otter, Willem']","['Eidukevicius R', 'Characiejus D', 'Janavicius R', 'Kazlauskaite N', 'Pasukoniene V', 'Mauricas M', 'Den Otter W']","['Faculty of Mathematics and Informatics, Vilnius University, Naugarduko 24, 03225 Vilnius, Lithuania. rimantas.eidukevicius@sc.vu.lt']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,BMC Cancer,BMC cancer,100967800,IM,"['Animals', 'Antimetabolites/*pharmacology', 'Bromodeoxyuridine/*pharmacology', 'Cell Cycle', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry/*methods', 'G1 Phase', 'G2 Phase', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Kinetics', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred DBA', 'Models, Statistical', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Software', 'Statistics as Topic']",2005/09/24 09:00,2006/02/28 09:00,['2005/09/24 09:00'],"['2004/12/28 00:00 [received]', '2005/09/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2005/09/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/02/28 09:00 [medline]', '2005/09/24 09:00 [entrez]']",epublish,BMC Cancer. 2005 Sep 22;5:122. doi: 10.1186/1471-2407-5-122.,,"['0 (Antimetabolites)', 'G34N38R2N1 (Bromodeoxyuridine)']",,"['1471-2407-5-122 [pii]', '10.1186/1471-2407-5-122 [doi]']",,,,20050922,PMC1261259,['BMC Cancer. 2006;6:184'],,,,,,,,,,

We reviewed 95 consecutive patients receiving autologous (n = 37) or allogeneic (n = 58) HSCT at Children's Memorial Hospital between January, 1995 and February, 1998. Diagnoses included leukemia (n = 43), solid tumor (n = 27), bone marrow failure syndrome (n = 12), non-malignant disease (n = 8), CNS tumors (n = 5) and immunodeficiency (n = 3). Tc-99 GFR was compared with a calculated creatinine clearance derived from the Schwartz formula (CCrC) prior to HSCT. These measures of renal function were compared with the patient's subsequent clinical course to determine if patients who developed renal insufficiency of sufficient magnitude as to require continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH) or dialysis, could have been identified. Overall comparison of the two methods of evaluation of renal function showed low correlation with values obtained by CCrC, which were consistently higher in most patients (r-value 0.01 in the regression analysis and a p = 0.08 95% CI -24.15 to 1.48). When stratified for age, correlation between the two methods was excellent only in children younger than 5 yr of age p = 0.02 95%, CI 0.032-0.49). Eleven patients required therapy with CVVH or dialysis but neither CCrC nor Tc-99 GFR prior to transplant predicted this event. Patients who received TBI were statistically more prone to develop renal insufficiency than those without TBI (p < 0.0001, 95% CI 0.25-0.008). Neither the Tc-99 GFR nor the CCrC was predictive of the development of renal insufficiency in HSCT patients as the majority of patients who required dialysis had normal Tc-99 GFR prior to transplant. The characteristics found in the patients who developed renal insufficiency and required dialysis include: the use of total body irradiation as part of the transplant-conditioning regimen (p < 0.0001) and the use of continuous infusion CSA (p = 0.04).","['Kletzel, M', 'Pirich, L', 'Haut, P', 'Cohn, R A']","['Kletzel M', 'Pirich L', 'Haut P', 'Cohn RA']","[""Division of Pediatric Hematology Oncology and Transplantation, Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine and Children's Memorial Hospital, Chicago, IL 60614, USA. mkletzel@nortwestern.edu""]",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",Denmark,Pediatr Transplant,Pediatric transplantation,9802574,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Creatinine/*blood', 'Female', '*Glomerular Filtration Rate', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/adverse effects', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Kidney Function Tests', 'Male', '*Radioisotope Renography', 'Renal Insufficiency/etiology', '*Technetium']",2005/09/24 09:00,2006/01/27 09:00,['2005/09/24 09:00'],"['2005/09/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/01/27 09:00 [medline]', '2005/09/24 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Pediatr Transplant. 2005 Oct;9(5):584-8. doi: 10.1111/j.1399-3046.2005.00340.x.,,"['7440-26-8 (Technetium)', 'AYI8EX34EU (Creatinine)']",,"['PTR340 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1399-3046.2005.00340.x [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Selecting the appropriate antimicrobial at the commencement of therapy, both in terms of spectrum of activity and dose and frequency of administration according to concentration or time dependency, is mandatory in this setting. Despite appropriate standard dosage regimens, failure of the antimicrobial treatment may occur because of the inability of the antimicrobial to achieve adequate concentrations at the infection site through alterations in its pharmacokinetics due to underlying pathophysiological conditions. According to the intrinsic chemicophysical properties of antimicrobials, hydrophilic antimicrobials (beta-lactams, aminoglycosides, glycopeptides) have to be considered at much higher risk of inter- and intraindividual pharmacokinetic variations than lipophilic antimicrobials (macrolides, fluoroquinolones, tetracyclines, chloramphenicol, rifampicin [rifampin]) in critically ill patients, with significant frequent fluctuations of plasma concentrations that may require significant dosage adjustments. For example, underexposure may occur because of increased volume of distribution (as a result of oedema in sepsis and trauma, pleural effusion, ascites, mediastinitis, fluid therapy or indwelling post-surgical drainage) and/or enhanced renal clearance (as a result of burns, drug abuse, hyperdynamic conditions during sepsis, acute leukaemia or use of haemodynamically active drugs). On the other hand, overexposure may occur because of a drop in renal clearance caused by renal impairment. Care with all these factors whenever choosing an antimicrobial may substantially improve the outcome of antimicrobial therapy in critically ill patients. However, since these situations may often coexist in the same patient and pharmacokinetic variability may be unpredictable, the antimicrobial policy may further benefit from real-time application of therapeutic drug monitoring, since this practice, by tailoring exposure to the individual patient, may consequently be helpful both in improving the outcome of antimicrobial therapy and in containing the spread of resistance in the hospital setting.","['Pea, Federico', 'Viale, Pierluigi', 'Furlanut, Mario']","['Pea F', 'Viale P', 'Furlanut M']","['Department of Experimental and Clinical Pathology and Medicine, Medical School, Institute of Clinical Pharmacology and Toxicology, University of Udine, Udine, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Switzerland,Clin Pharmacokinet,Clinical pharmacokinetics,7606849,IM,"['Anti-Infective Agents/*pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use', 'Bacterial Infections/drug therapy/physiopathology', '*Critical Care', 'Drug Monitoring', 'Humans', 'Kidney/metabolism/physiopathology', 'Patient Care Team', 'Practice Guidelines as Topic']",2005/09/24 09:00,2006/01/13 09:00,['2005/09/24 09:00'],"['2005/09/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/01/13 09:00 [medline]', '2005/09/24 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Clin Pharmacokinet. 2005;44(10):1009-34. doi: 10.2165/00003088-200544100-00002.,,['0 (Anti-Infective Agents)'],202,"['44102 [pii]', '10.2165/00003088-200544100-00002 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Bacterial translocation via intestinal mucosa is a significant mechanism of FN development. Competitive inhibition of bowel colonization by pathogenic microorganisms by lactic acid bacteria could be a useful prevention of FN. The aim of the study was the prevention of FN by probiotic strain Enterococcus faecium M-74 enriched with selenium in leukemic patients. Fourteen (six males/eight females) patients with myelogenous leukemia treated by induction or consolidation chemotherapy were included in the study. Patients received prophylaxis with E. faecium M-74 during one cycle of chemotherapy. The daily dose was 36 x 10(9) CFU tid. Prophylaxis started between day -2 and day +2 of chemotherapy and continued until the absolute neutrophile count (ANC) was >1,000/microl. All patients experienced febrile neutropenia. During 231 days of severe neutropenia, 30 febrile episodes occurred. No any febrile episode or infection provoked by the strain tested was noticed. Tolerance of therapy was excellent without significant adverse effects. Our results demonstrate the safety of the probiotic strain E. faecium M-74 enriched with selenium in leukemic patients with severe neutropenia.

We previously showed that the JSRV long terminal repeat (LTR) is preferentially active in murine lung epithelial cell lines (MLE-15 and mtCC1-2). To further explore the tissue specificity, we inserted the JSRV enhancer sequences from the U3 region of the LTR into a Moloney murine leukemia virus (M-MuLV) LTR lacking its own enhancer sequences, to give the chimeric LTR DeltaMo + JS. Transient transfection assays indicated that the DeltaMo + JS LTR is > 5-fold more active in lung epithelial cell lines than in non-lung lines, compared to the wild-type M-MuLV LTR. This was due to preferential activity of the JSRV enhancers in lung epithelial cells. Moreover, M-MuLV driven by the DeltaMo + JS LTR was > 3 logs more infectious in MLE-15 cells compared to non-lung cell lines.

DNA methylation has been proposed as a candidate mediator of this field defect. The DNA repair gene O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) is frequently methylated in colorectal cancer. We hypothesized that MGMT methylation could be one of the mediators of field cancerization in the colon mucosa. METHODS: We studied MGMT promoter methylation by three different bisulfite-based techniques in tumor, adjacent mucosa, and non-adjacent mucosa from 95 colorectal cancer patients and in colon mucosa from 33 subjects with no evidence of cancer. Statistical tests were two-sided. RESULTS: MGMT promoter methylation was present in 46% of the tumors. Patients whose cancer had MGMT promoter methylation also had substantial MGMT promoter methylation in apparently normal adjacent mucosa. This methylation was seen with a quantitative assay in 50% (22/44; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 34% to 65%) of normal samples with MGMT promoter methylation in the adjacent tumors, 6% (3/51; 95% CI = 1% to 16%) of samples without MGMT methylation in adjacent tumors, and 12% (4/33; 95% CI = 3% to 28%) of control samples (P < .001 for comparison between each of the latter two groups and the first group). MGMT methylation was detected with a more sensitive assay in 94%, 34%, and 27% of these samples, respectively (P < .001). In grossly normal colonic mucosa of colon cancer patients, methylation was detected 10 cm away from the tumor in 10 of 13 cases. Tumors with MGMT promoter methylation had a higher rate of G-to-A mutation in the KRAS oncogene than tumors without MGMT promoter methylation (10/42 versus 3/46, P = .03). Using a sensitive mutant allele-specific amplification assay for KRAS mutations, we also found KRAS mutations in 12% (3/25; 95% CI = 2.5% to 31%) of colorectal mucosas with detectable MGMT methylation and 3% (2/64; 95% CI = 0.4% to 11%) of colorectal mucosas without MGMT methylation (P = .13). CONCLUSION: Some colorectal cancers arise from a field defect defined by epigenetic inactivation of MGMT. Detection of this abnormality may ultimately be useful in risk assessment for colorectal cancer.","['Shen, Lanlan', 'Kondo, Yutaka', 'Rosner, Gary L', 'Xiao, Lianchun', 'Hernandez, Natalie Supunpong', 'Vilaythong, Jill', 'Houlihan, P Scott', 'Krouse, Robert S', 'Prasad, Anil R', 'Einspahr, Janine G', 'Buckmeier, Julie', 'Alberts, David S', 'Hamilton, Stanley R', 'Issa, Jean-Pierre J']","['Shen L', 'Kondo Y', 'Rosner GL', 'Xiao L', 'Hernandez NS', 'Vilaythong J', 'Houlihan PS', 'Krouse RS', 'Prasad AR', 'Einspahr JG', 'Buckmeier J', 'Alberts DS', 'Hamilton SR', 'Issa JP']","['Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas M.

In this study, we determined its effects on survival of human monocytic cells during macrophagic differentiation, an important biological process involved in the immune response. As(2)O(3) used at clinically relevant pharmacological concentrations induced marked apoptosis of human blood monocytes during differentiation with either granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor or macrophage colony-stimulating factor. Apoptosis of monocytes was associated with increased caspase activities and decreased DNA binding of p65 nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB); like As(2)O(3), the selective NF-kappaB inhibitor (E)-3-[(4-methylphenyl)-sulfonyl]-2-propenenitrile (Bay 11-7082) strongly reduced survival of differentiating monocytes. The role of NF-kappaB in arsenic toxicity was also studied in promonocytic U937 cells during phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate-induced macrophagic differentiation. In these cells, As(2)O(3) first reduced DNA binding of p65 NF-kappaB and subsequently induced apoptosis. In addition, overexpression of the p65 NF-kappaB subunit, following stable infection with a p65 retroviral expressing vector, increased survival of As(2)O(3)-treated U937 cells. As(2)O(3) specifically decreased protein levels of X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein and FLICE-inhibitory protein, two NF-kappaB-regulated genes in both U937 cells and blood monocytes during their differentiations. Finally, As(2)O(3) was found to inhibit macrophagic differentiation of monocytic cells when used at cytotoxic concentrations; however, overexpression of the p65 NF-kappaB subunit in U937 cells reduced its effects toward differentiation. In contrast to monocytes, well differentiated macrophages were resistant to low concentrations of As(2)O(3). Altogether, our study demonstrates that clinically relevant concentrations of As(2)O(3) induced marked apoptosis of monocytic cells during in vitro macrophagic differentiation likely through inhibition of NF-kappaB-related survival pathways.","['Lemarie, Anthony', 'Morzadec, Claudie', 'Merino, Delphine', 'Micheau, Olivier', 'Fardel, Olivier', 'Vernhet, Laurent']","['Lemarie A', 'Morzadec C', 'Merino D', 'Micheau O', 'Fardel O', 'Vernhet L']","['Unite INSERM U620, De-toxication et Reparation Tissulaire, Faculte des Sciences Pharmaceutiques et Biologiques, Universite de Rennes 1, 2 avenue du Pr.

Previous studies suggested that the Friend virus oncoprotein, gp55, constitutively activates the erythropoietin receptor (EPOR), causing uncontrolled erythroid proliferation. Those studies showed that gp55 confers growth factor independence on an interleukin-3 (IL-3)-dependent cell line (Ba/F3) when the EPOR is coexpressed. Subsequently, we showed that a truncated form of the stem-cell kinase receptor (sf-STK) is required for susceptibility to Friend disease. Given the requirement for sf-STK, we sought to establish the in vivo significance of gp55-mediated activation of the EPOR. We found that the cytoplasmic tyrosine residues of the EPOR, and signal transducer and activator of transcription-5 (STAT5), which acts through these sites, are not required for Friend virus-induced erythroblastosis. The EPOR itself was required for the development of erythroblastosis but not for gp55-mediated erythroid proliferation.

None of this was apparent just 20 years ago, yet this kind of stem cell thinking already provides new perspectives in medical science and could usher in new therapies. Today, political, religious, and ethical issues surround embryonic stem cell and patient-specific pluripotent stem cell research and are center stage in the attempts by governments to ban these fields for discovery and potential therapies.

A number of methods have been proposed and successfully applied to this problem. It has recently been shown that classification by nearest centroids provides an accurate predictor that may outperform much more complicated methods. The 'Prediction Analysis of Microarrays' (PAM) approach is one such example, which the authors strongly motivate by its simplicity and interpretability. In this spirit, I seek to assess the performance of classifiers simpler than even PAM. RESULTS: I surprisingly show that the modified t-statistics and shrunken centroids employed by PAM tend to increase misclassification error when compared with their simpler counterparts. Based on these observations, I propose a classification method called 'Classification to Nearest Centroids' (ClaNC). ClaNC ranks genes by standard t-statistics, does not shrink centroids and uses a class-specific gene-selection procedure. Because of these modifications, ClaNC is arguably simpler and easier to interpret than PAM, and it can be viewed as a traditional nearest centroid classifier that uses specially selected genes. I demonstrate that ClaNC error rates tend to be significantly less than those for PAM, for a given number of active genes.

The aim of this study was to determine the laboratory and clinical relevance of a comprehensive PCR-based assay for detecting eight HHVs, which are lymphotropic and cause disease in humans. Using 176 samples collected from 146 specimens of peripheral blood, 12 skin nodules, 11 lymph nodes and 7 others of patients who were suspected to have adult T cell leukemia (ATL), the PCR-based assay was validated to simultaneously detect one or more herpes viral DNA with two consensus primer sets.

Furthermore, such a herpes viral DNA positive status was not always associated with clinical symptoms relating to the virus, implying active replication in the blood cells, but being asymptomatic. HHV-8 viral DNA, although Kaposi's sarcoma has been reported to be complicated with ATL, was not demonstrable. HHV-6B was detected only in HTLV-1 healthy carriers and ATL patients, and may imply a co-factor role with HTLV-1.

However, there is little data about the effects of it on plasma membrane. In the present study, the cytotoxicity of realgar to HL-60 cells including its inhibiting cell growth, inducing apoptosis and bringing about membrane toxicity was investigated.

Flow cytometric analysis revealed that treatment with realgar resulted in increased percentages of apoptotic cells in a dose-dependent manner. On the other hand, membrane lipid peroxidation level, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) leakage and membrane surface topography alterations were investigated to assess the membrane toxicity induced by realgar. Treatment with realgar at different concentrations accelerated membrane lipid peroxidation, potentiated LDH leakage, which was consistent with enhanced disorganization of membrane surface observed by atomic force microscopy (AFM). These results suggested that such membrane toxicity induced by realgar might play an important role in the process of apoptotic induction and could be considered as one of mechanisms underlying the cytotoxicity of realgar.","['Ye, Han-Qing', 'Gan, Lu', 'Yang, Xiang-Liang', 'Xu, Hui-Bi']","['Ye HQ', 'Gan L', 'Yang XL', 'Xu HB']","[""College of Life Science and Technology, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan 430074, People's Republic of China. hanqingyel976@hotmail.com""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Ireland,J Ethnopharmacol,Journal of ethnopharmacology,7903310,IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Arsenicals/*pharmacology', 'Cell Membrane/drug effects/metabolism', 'Cell Membrane Permeability', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'HL-60 Cells/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Inhibitory Concentration 50', 'L-Lactate Dehydrogenase/metabolism', 'Lipid Peroxidation', 'Medicine, Chinese Traditional', 'Sulfides/*pharmacology']",2005/09/22 09:00,2007/07/31 09:00,['2005/09/22 09:00'],"['2004/12/13 00:00 [received]', '2005/07/26 00:00 [revised]', '2005/08/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2005/09/22 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/07/31 09:00 [medline]', '2005/09/22 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Ethnopharmacol. 2006 Feb 20;103(3):366-71. doi: 10.1016/j.jep.2005.08.014.

METHODS: The effects of deguelin on the growth of U937 cells were studied by MTT assay. The effect of deguelin on the cell cycle of U937 cells was studied by using a propidium iodide method. The localization of the nuclear pore complex proteins Nup98 and Nup88 was investigated by using immunofluorescence and immunoelectron microscopy. The expression of Nup98 and Nup88 in U937 cells was investigated by using flow cytometry and Western blot. RESULTS: The proliferation of U937 cells was inhibited in the deguelin-treated group, with a 24-h IC(50) value of 21.61 nmol/L and a 36-h IC(50) value of 17.07 nmol/L. U937 cells treated with deguelin had reduced percentages of cells in the G(0)/G(1) phase, whereas cells accumulated in the S and G(2)/M phases. Nup88 and Nup98 were found on both the nuclear and cytoplasmic sides of the U937 cells by using immunofluorescence and immunoelectron microscopy. The expression of Nup98 was upregulated and that of the Nup88 protein was downregulated in U937 cells treated with deguelin. CONCLUSION: Deguelin is able to inhibit the proliferation of U937 cells by regulating the cell cycle such that cells are arrested at the S and G(2)/M phases, so that the proportion of cells in the G(0)/G(1) phase decreases. The antitumor effects of deguelin are related to upregulating the expression of Nup98 and downregulating the expression of Nup88 protein in U937 cells.","['Liu, Hong-li', 'Chen, Yan', 'Cui, Guo-hui', 'Wu, Qiu-ling', 'He, Jing', 'Chen, Wei-hua', 'Zhou, Jian-feng']","['Liu HL', 'Chen Y', 'Cui GH', 'Wu QL', 'He J', 'Chen WH', 'Zhou JF']","['Department of Hematology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan 430022, China. liuhl60@tom.com']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Acta Pharmacol Sin,Acta pharmacologica Sinica,100956087,IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Cell Cycle', 'Cell Proliferation/*drug effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Fabaceae/chemistry', 'Humans', 'Nuclear Pore Complex Proteins/*metabolism', 'Plants, Medicinal/chemistry', 'Rotenone/administration & dosage/*analogs & derivatives/isolation & purification/pharmacology', 'U937 Cells']",2005/09/22 09:00,2006/12/21 09:00,['2005/09/22 09:00'],"['2005/09/22 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/12/21 09:00 [medline]', '2005/09/22 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Acta Pharmacol Sin. 2005 Oct;26(10):1265-73. doi: 10.1111/j.1745-7254.2005.00192.x.,,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (NUP88 protein, human)', '0 (Nuclear Pore Complex Proteins)', '0 (nuclear pore complex protein 98)', '03L9OT429T (Rotenone)', 'K5Z93K66IE (deguelin)']",,['10.1111/j.1745-7254.2005.00192.x [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Induction deaths and deaths in first complete remission (CR1) were included in the study. A total of 56 deaths (3%) were identified: 19 died during induction (1%) and 37 in CR1 (2%). Infection was the major cause of death in 38 cases. Five patients died of early death before initiation of cytotoxic therapy. Five patients died because of toxicity of inner organs and one of accidental procedure failures. Seven patients died of complications following allogenic haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) in CR1. Girls were at higher risk of treatment-related death (TRD) [relative risk (RR) = 2.2; 95% confidence interval (CI(95%)): 1.2-4.0, P < 0.01], mostly because of infections. Risk of TRD was also higher in children with Down syndrome (RR = 4.5; CI(95%): 2.0-10.2, P < 0.00). In conclusion, 3% of children with ALL died of TRD, with bacterial infections as the most common cause of death. Girls and Down syndrome patients had a higher risk of TRD. Infections still remain a major challenge in childhood ALL.","['Christensen, Merete Stubkjaer', 'Heyman, Mats', 'Mottonen, Merja', 'Zeller, Bernward', 'Jonmundsson, Gudmundur', 'Hasle, Henrik']","['Christensen MS', 'Heyman M', 'Mottonen M', 'Zeller B', 'Jonmundsson G', 'Hasle H']","['Department of Paediatrics, Skejby Hospital, Aarhus, Denmark.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Bacterial Infections/mortality', 'Cause of Death', 'Child', 'Down Syndrome/complications/mortality/therapy', 'Female', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/adverse effects', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Opportunistic Infections/mortality', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/*mortality/surgery', 'Remission Induction', 'Risk Factors', 'Scandinavian and Nordic Countries/epidemiology', 'Sex Factors', 'Treatment Outcome']",2005/09/22 09:00,2005/11/16 09:00,['2005/09/22 09:00'],"['2005/09/22 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/11/16 09:00 [medline]', '2005/09/22 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2005 Oct;131(1):50-8. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.2005.05736.x.,,,,"['BJH5736 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1365-2141.2005.05736.x [doi]']",,,['Nordic Society of Paediatric Haematology and Oncology (NOPHO)'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Multivariate analyses strongly support a raised serum lactate dehydrogenase level and the involvement of more than one extranodal site as the strongest predictors of subsequent CNS relapse.

Rho-kinase (ROK) stimulation represents a key step in the maintenance of agonist-induced contraction, an effect counteracted by nitric oxide (NO) released from the endothelium. The aim of the present study was to characterize the involvement of ROK in smooth muscle contraction of the rat coeliac artery using functional and expression studies. 2. Rings of rat coeliac artery were mounted in 5 mL myographs containing warmed and oxygenated Krebs' solution. Rings were connected to isometric transducers and data were recorded in a PowerLab system (ADInstruments, Colorado Springs, CO, USA). After a 60 min equilibration period, preparations were precontracted with phenylephrine (1 micromol/L). Endothelial integrity was assessed by treating the vessels with acetylcholine (1 micromol/L). Expression of ROKalpha, ROKbeta and RhoA was analysed using western blot, whereas Rho guanine nucleotide exchange factors (RhoGEF) were measured at the mRNA level. 3. The addition of Y-27632 (0.01-30 micromol/L) caused sustained relaxation of rings contracted with phenylephrine (PE; 1 micromol/L), with intact or denuded endothelium (pEC50 = 6.38 +/- 0.03 and 5.65 +/- 0.02, respectively). NG-Nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (100 micromol/L) or 1H-[1,2,4]oxadiazolo[4,3-a]quinoxalin-1-one (10 micromol/L), but not indomethacin (10 micromol/L), caused marked rightward shifts of the concentration-response curves to Y-27632. The contractile response to KCl (80 mmol/L) was significantly reduced by Y-27632, with a maximal inhibition of 57 +/- 6%. Nifedipine (0.1-100 nmol/L) fully blocked KCl-evoked contractions, but only marginally affected those in response to PE (27 +/- 2% maximal inhibition). At 1 micromol/L, Y-27632 also significantly enhanced relaxations to sodium nitroprusside (SNP; 0.0001-1 micromol/L). 4. At 1 micromol/L, SNP (but not 1 micromol/L Y-27632) significantly elevated the cGMP content above basal levels. Coincubation with SNP and Y-27632 increased cGMP levels, but the results were not significantly different from those in the presence of SNP alone. 5. Western blot analysis revealed the protein expression of RhoA, ROKalpha and ROKbeta. The PDZ-RhoGEF, p115RhoGEF and leukaemia-associated RhoGEF (LARG) mRNA expression in coeliac artery was visualized by electrophoresis on agarose gels. 6. The results clearly demonstrate a role for the RhoA/ROK signalling pathway in the regulation of rat coeliac artery smooth muscle contraction. The findings of the present study suggest that endogenous nitric oxide-induced relaxation is mediated, in part, by inhibition of RhoA/ROK signalling in this tissue.","['Teixeira, Cleber E', 'Jin, Liming', 'Ying, Zhekang', 'Palmer, Trenis', 'Priviero, Fernanda B M', 'Webb, R Clinton']","['Teixeira CE', 'Jin L', 'Ying Z', 'Palmer T', 'Priviero FB', 'Webb RC']","['Department of Physiology, Medical College of Georgia, Augusta, Georgia 30912-3000, USA. cteixeira@mail.mcg.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Australia,Clin Exp Pharmacol Physiol,Clinical and experimental pharmacology & physiology,0425076,IM,"['Amides/pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Blotting, Western', 'Celiac Artery/drug effects/metabolism/*physiology', 'Cyclic GMP/metabolism', 'Cyclooxygenase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Gene Expression/drug effects', 'Guanine Nucleotide Exchange Factors/genetics', 'Guanylate Cyclase/antagonists & inhibitors', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Indomethacin/pharmacology', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins', 'Male', 'NG-Nitroarginine Methyl Ester/pharmacology', 'Nitric Oxide Synthase/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Nitroprusside/pharmacology', 'Oxadiazoles/pharmacology', 'Phenylephrine/pharmacology', 'Potassium/pharmacology', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/*metabolism', 'Pyridines/pharmacology', 'Quinoxalines/pharmacology', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'Rats', 'Rats, Sprague-Dawley', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Rho Guanine Nucleotide Exchange Factors', 'Signal Transduction/*physiology', 'Vasoconstrictor Agents/pharmacology', 'Vasodilation/drug effects', 'Vasodilator Agents/pharmacology', 'rho-Associated Kinases', 'rhoA GTP-Binding Protein/*metabolism']",2005/09/22 09:00,2006/01/06 09:00,['2005/09/22 09:00'],"['2005/09/22 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/01/06 09:00 [medline]', '2005/09/22 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Clin Exp Pharmacol Physiol. 2005 Oct;32(10):817-24. doi: 10.1111/j.1440-1681.2005.04271.x.,"['HL-71138/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL-74167/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']","['0 (1H-(1,2,4)oxadiazolo(4,3-a)quinoxalin-1-one)', '0 (Amides)', '0 (Cyclooxygenase Inhibitors)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Guanine Nucleotide Exchange Factors)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Oxadiazoles)', '0 (Pyridines)', '0 (Quinoxalines)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Rho Guanine Nucleotide Exchange Factors)', '0 (Vasoconstrictor Agents)', '0 (Vasodilator Agents)', '138381-45-0 (Y 27632)', '169D1260KM (Nitroprusside)', '1WS297W6MV (Phenylephrine)', 'EC 1.14.13.39 (Nitric Oxide Synthase)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (rho-Associated Kinases)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (rhoA GTP-Binding Protein)', 'EC 4.6.1.2 (Guanylate Cyclase)', 'H2D2X058MU (Cyclic GMP)', 'RWP5GA015D (Potassium)', 'V55S2QJN2X (NG-Nitroarginine Methyl Ester)', 'XXE1CET956 (Indomethacin)']",,"['CEP4271 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1440-1681.2005.04271.x [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The expressions of cyclin D1 and c-myc in HL-60 are suppressed by 8-chloroadenosine, whereas the cyclin-dependent kinases inhibitor p21(WAF1/CIP1) is up-regulated. 8-Chloroadenosine has less effect on the expressions of cyclin-dependent kinase (cdk)2 and cdk4, G(1) phase cyclin-dependent kinases, and only moderately induces the expression of transforming growth factor beta1 (TGFbeta1) and the mitotic inhibitor p27(KIP1).

Therefore, anti-proliferation of HL-60 cells by 8-chloroadenosine involves coordination of cyclin D1 suppression, reduction of telomerase activity, and up-regulation of p21(WAF1/CIP1) that arrest cell-cycle progression at G(0)/G(1) phase and terminate cell differentiation.","['Zhu, Bing', 'Zhang, Li He', 'Zhao, Yong Mei', 'Cui, Jing Rong', 'Strada, Samuel J']","['Zhu B', 'Zhang LH', 'Zhao YM', 'Cui JR', 'Strada SJ']","['Department of Pharmacology, University of South Alabama College of Medicine, Mobile, AL 36688, USA. zbing@jaguar1.usouthal.edu']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Cell Biochem,Journal of cellular biochemistry,8205768,IM,"['2-Chloroadenosine/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Differentiation/*drug effects', 'Cell Division/*drug effects', 'Cyclin D1/*metabolism', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21/*metabolism', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Flow Cytometry', 'G1 Phase/*drug effects', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Resting Phase, Cell Cycle/*drug effects', 'Telomerase/metabolism']",2005/09/21 09:00,2006/04/29 09:00,['2005/09/21 09:00'],"['2005/09/21 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/04/29 09:00 [medline]', '2005/09/21 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Cell Biochem. 2006 Jan 1;97(1):166-77. doi: 10.1002/jcb.20630.,,"['0 (CDKN1A protein, human)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21)', '136601-57-5 (Cyclin D1)', '146-77-0 (2-Chloroadenosine)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (Telomerase)', 'PA05MFH3I7 (8-chloroadenosine)']",,['10.1002/jcb.20630 [doi]'],,"['(c) 2005 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In several developmental pathways, PBX1 binds to MEINOX family members in the cytoplasm to be imported into the nucleus where they associate with HOX proteins to form a higher complex that modulates gene expression. This concept has been challenged by a recent report showing that in some cell cultures, PBX1 nuclear localization might be regulated independently of MEINOX proteins (Kilstrup-Nielsen et al., 2003). Our work gives the first illustration of this alternative mechanism in an organogenesis process. Indeed, we show that PBX1 is mostly cytoplasmic in epithelial endometrial cells of the developing female genital tract despite the nuclear localization of MEIS1. We thus provide evidence for a control of PBX1 intracellular distribution which is independent of MEINOX proteins, but is cell cycle correlated.","['Dintilhac, Agnes', 'Bihan, Rejane', 'Guerrier, Daniel', 'Deschamps, Stephane', 'Bougerie, Heloise', 'Watrin, Tanguy', 'Bonnec, Georgette', 'Pellerin, Isabelle']","['Dintilhac A', 'Bihan R', 'Guerrier D', 'Deschamps S', 'Bougerie H', 'Watrin T', 'Bonnec G', 'Pellerin I']","['UMR 6061, Genetique et Developpement, IFR 140, Universite de Rennes 1, Campus Villejean, Rennes, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Spain,Int J Dev Biol,The International journal of developmental biology,8917470,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Cycle', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Nucleus/metabolism', 'Cytoplasm/metabolism', 'Epithelial Cells/cytology/*metabolism', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental', 'Genitalia, Female/cytology/*embryology/*metabolism', 'Homeodomain Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Myeloid Ecotropic Viral Integration Site 1 Protein', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Pre-B-Cell Leukemia Transcription Factor 1', 'Protein Transport', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/*metabolism']",2005/09/21 09:00,2006/01/25 09:00,['2005/09/21 09:00'],"['2005/09/21 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/01/25 09:00 [medline]', '2005/09/21 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Int J Dev Biol. 2005;49(7):851-8. doi: 10.1387/ijdb.052013ad.,,"['0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (MEIS1 protein, human)', '0 (Meis1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Myeloid Ecotropic Viral Integration Site 1 Protein)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Pbx1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Pre-B-Cell Leukemia Transcription Factor 1)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '157907-48-7 (HoxA protein)']",,"['052013ad [pii]', '10.1387/ijdb.052013ad [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We identified the preferences of children and adolescents with advanced cancer about their end-of-life care and the factors that influenced their decisions. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Pediatric patients 10 or more years of age were interviewed within 7 days of participating in one of the following three end-of-life decisions: enrollment onto a phase I trial (n = 7), adoption of a do not resuscitate order (n = 5), or initiation of terminal care (n = 8). The patient, a parent, and the primary pediatric oncologist were interviewed separately by using open-ended interview questions. RESULTS: Twenty patients, aged 10 to 20 years (mean, 17 years and 4 months), with a refractory solid tumor (n = 12), brain tumor (n = 4), or leukemia (n = 4) participated. Eighteen patients (90%) accurately recalled all of their treatment options and identified their own death as a consequence of their decision. The factors that were most frequently identified included the following: for patients, caring about others (n = 19 patients); for parents, the child's preferences (n = 18 parents); and for physicians, the patient's prognosis and comorbid conditions (n = 14 physicians). CONCLUSION: These children and adolescents with advanced cancer realized that they were involved in an end-of-life decision, understood the consequences of their decision, and were capable of participating in a complex decision process involving risks to themselves and others. The decision factors most frequently reported by patients were relationship based; this finding is contrary to existing developmental theories.","['Hinds, Pamela S', 'Drew, Donna', 'Oakes, Linda L', 'Fouladi, Maryam', 'Spunt, Sheri L', 'Church, Christopher', 'Furman, Wayne L']","['Hinds PS', 'Drew D', 'Oakes LL', 'Fouladi M', 'Spunt SL', 'Church C', 'Furman WL']","[""Division of Nursing Research and Patient Care Services, Department of Hematology-Oncology, Palliative and End-of-Life Care Task Force, and Ethics Committee, St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN, USA. pam.hinds@stjude.org""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Altruism', 'Child', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Death', '*Decision Making', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/*rehabilitation', 'Parent-Child Relations', 'Prognosis', '*Terminal Care']",2005/09/21 09:00,2006/02/04 09:00,['2005/09/21 09:00'],"['2005/09/21 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/02/04 09:00 [medline]', '2005/09/21 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2005 Dec 20;23(36):9146-54. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2005.10.538.

In contrast, ectopic telomerase expression in fibroblasts and other cells leads to telomere length maintenance or elongation. It is unclear whether this disparity can be attributed to telomerase level or stems from fundamentally different telomere biology. Here, we show that telomerase overexpression does not prevent proliferation-associated telomere shortening in human hematopoietic cells, pointing to the existence of cell type-specific differences in telomere dynamics. Furthermore, we observed eventual stabilization of telomere length without detectable changes in telomerase activity during establishment of two leukemic cell lines from normal cord blood cells, indicating that additional cooperating events are required for telomere maintenance in immortalized human hematopoietic cells.","['Wang, J C Y', 'Warner, J K', 'Erdmann, N', 'Lansdorp, P M', 'Harrington, L', 'Dick, J E']","['Wang JC', 'Warner JK', 'Erdmann N', 'Lansdorp PM', 'Harrington L', 'Dick JE']","['Department of Molecular and Medical Genetics, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada M5S 1A8.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,IM,"['*Cell Proliferation', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'DNA, Complementary/genetics', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*metabolism', 'Fetal Blood/cytology', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Fluorescein-5-isothiocyanate', 'HeLa Cells', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*enzymology', 'Humans', 'Lentivirus', 'Leukemia/*enzymology', 'Telomerase/*metabolism', 'Telomere/*genetics']",2005/09/21 09:00,2006/03/29 09:00,['2005/09/21 09:00'],"['2005/09/21 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/03/29 09:00 [medline]', '2005/09/21 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2005 Oct 4;102(40):14398-403. doi: 10.1073/pnas.0504161102.

Recent reports have suggested a role for PBK in mitotic progression. In the present study, we demonstrate that PBK is down regulated during doxorubicin induced growth arrest of HL60 promyelocytic leukemia cells at least partly due to cell cycle-specific transcriptional regulation. Furthermore, we show that transcriptional control is mostly due to binding of transcription factors E2F and CREB/ATF to two distinct binding sites within the PBK promoter. This was demonstrated by: (i) electrophoretic mobility shift assays showing transcription factor binding within the PBK promoter at the putative E2F (-146bp) and CREB/ATF (-312bp) binding sites; (ii) Western immunoblot analysis of knockdown extracts from siRNA inhibition of transcription factor expression showing that PBK protein expression is dependent upon the presence of these transcription factors; (iii) codistribution of CREB factor and PBK in cell lines of disparate tissue origin; and (iv) luciferase reporter assays showing that PBK promoter activity is dependent on factor binding at intact E2F and CREB/ATF sites. These findings may provide insight into the mechanisms that upregulate PBK expression in proliferative hematologic malignancies and down regulate its expression following growth arrest of leukemic cells.","['Nandi, Asit K', 'Rapoport, Aaron P']","['Nandi AK', 'Rapoport AP']","['University of Maryland School of Medicine, Greenebaum Cancer Center, 655 W Baltimore Street, Baltimore, MD 21201, USA. anandi@som.umaryland.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,IM,"['Activating Transcription Factors/*metabolism', 'Base Sequence', 'Blood Proteins/*metabolism', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Cycle', 'Cell Line', 'Cyclic AMP Response Element-Binding Protein/*metabolism', 'DNA Primers', 'E2F Transcription Factors/*metabolism', 'Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinases', 'Mutagenesis, Site-Directed', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/genetics/*metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction']",2005/09/21 09:00,2006/04/28 09:00,['2005/09/21 09:00'],"['2005/06/03 00:00 [received]', '2005/08/09 00:00 [revised]', '2005/08/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2005/09/21 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/04/28 09:00 [medline]', '2005/09/21 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 2006 Apr;30(4):437-47. doi: 10.1016/j.leukres.2005.08.011.

Control of AML cell growth was attempted using a replication-defective herpes simplex virus-1 vector, T0I kappa B alpha, overexpressing mutant I kappa B alpha to inhibit NF-kappa B in vitro. T0I kappa B alpha displays defective ICP4/ICP22/ICP27, isogenic thymidine kinase, and mutant I kappa B alpha. T0Z.1 expressing lacZ instead of I kappa B was used for controls. Infection of T0I kappa B alpha at 15 multiplicity of infection (MOI) with cells of AML lines, HL60, K562, and NB4 displaying >90% infection efficiency and tumor killing in vitro. Use of 10 microM of Ara-C alone was clinically equivalent to high-dose Ara-C, displaying 11% tumor killing. Neither ganciclovir (GCV) nor Ara-C enhanced T0I kappa B- alpha mediated tumor killing. Attenuation of NF-kappa B by T0I kappa B alpha was confirmed by EMSA. T0I kappa B alpha induced caspase-3 activity, with subsequent apoptosis confirmed by colorimetric and TUNEL assays. Fresh AML cells from 8 patients were infected with T0I kappa B alpha at 3 MOI, with or without GCV or 10 microM of Ara-C in vitro. Infection efficiency was 10%. T0I kappa B alpha displayed 8-15% tumor killing, superior to Ara-C in 6 of the 8 patients. Administration of Ara-C enhanced tumor killing in 5 of these 6 cases. Our results suggest that T0I kappa B alpha-mediated gene therapy induces apoptosis of AML cells in vitro.","['Kuwayama, Y', 'Suzuki, T', 'Moriuchi, S', 'Glorioso, J C', 'Bessho, M']","['Kuwayama Y', 'Suzuki T', 'Moriuchi S', 'Glorioso JC', 'Bessho M']","['Department of Hematology, Saitama Medical School, 38 Moroyama-machi, Iruma-gun, Saitama 350-0495, Japan. kuwayama@saitama-med.ac.jp']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",France,Cell Mol Biol (Noisy-le-grand),"Cellular and molecular biology (Noisy-le-Grand, France)",9216789,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', '*Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Caspase 3/metabolism', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Female', 'Ganciclovir/toxicity', '*Genetic Therapy', 'Genetic Vectors/genetics', 'Herpesvirus 1, Human/*genetics', 'Humans', 'I-kappa B Kinase/genetics/*metabolism', 'I-kappa B Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/metabolism/*pathology/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation/genetics', 'Thymidine Kinase/genetics/metabolism', 'Virus Replication']",2005/09/21 09:00,2006/12/15 09:00,['2005/09/21 09:00'],"['2003/11/28 00:00 [received]', '2003/12/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2005/09/21 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/12/15 09:00 [medline]', '2005/09/21 09:00 [entrez]']",epublish,Cell Mol Biol (Noisy-le-grand). 2005 Sep 2;51(1):77-86.,,"['0 (I-kappa B Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.1.21 (Thymidine Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.11.10 (I-kappa B Kinase)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'P9G3CKZ4P5 (Ganciclovir)']",,['77 [pii]'],,,,20050902,,,,,,,,,,,,

Among these drugs, the effect of tetrapeptide AcSDKP or AcSDKP-NH2 on AML cells, stimulated or not by cytokines, was also evaluated in order to determine (i) if AcSDKP was able to inhibit blast cell proliferation as it inhibits haematopoietic progenitors (ii) if AcSDKP-NH2 was more stable than AcSDKP with FBS. METHODS: For PKH labeling, cells were suspended in Diluent C, and rapidly admixed with PKH67 solution at 20 microM PKH67. Staining was stopped by addition of FBS. RESULTS: A good correlation between PKH67 labelling and bromodeoxyuridine incorporation was obtained first with 6/9 patients for control cells, then for 11/17 AML patients treated with classical antileukemic drugs (among whom 4 were also treated with AcSDKP). The effect of AcSDKP was also studied on 7 patients. The discrepancy between both methods was essentially due to an accumulation of cells into different cycle phases measured by BrdUrd incorporation secondary to drug action and PKH67 labelling which measured the dynamic proliferation. This last method allows identifying resistant cells which still proliferate. AcSDKP or AcSDKP-NH2 induced a decrease of leukemic cell proliferation in 5/7 patients when cytokines were added (in order to stimulate proliferation) one day after tetrapeptide AcSDKP or AcSDKP-NH2. No effect on proliferation was noted when cytokines were added to AcSDKP-NH2. CONCLUSION: PKH67 labelling method is a powerful tool for cell proliferation assessment in patients with AML, even in cells treated by various drugs.","['Boutonnat, Jean', 'Faussat, Anne-Marie', 'Marie, Jean-Pierre', 'Bignon, Jerome', 'Wdzieczak-Bakala, Johanna', 'Barbier, Magali', 'Thierry, Josiane', 'Ronot, Xavier', 'Colle, Pierre-Emmanuel']","['Boutonnat J', 'Faussat AM', 'Marie JP', 'Bignon J', 'Wdzieczak-Bakala J', 'Barbier M', 'Thierry J', 'Ronot X', 'Colle PE']","['Laboratoire de Dynamique Cellulaire, EPHE, IFRT 130, CNRS UMR 5525, 38706 La Tronche cedex, France. jean.boutonnat@ujf-grenoble.fr']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,BMC Cancer,BMC cancer,100967800,IM,"['Amsacrine/pharmacology', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/pharmacology', 'Bromodeoxyuridine/pharmacology', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cytarabine/pharmacology', 'DNA/metabolism', 'Daunorubicin/pharmacology', 'Etoposide/pharmacology', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Fluorescent Dyes/*pharmacology', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Hydrocarbons, Chlorinated/pharmacology', 'Leukemia/*pathology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/pathology', 'Microscopy, Fluorescence/*methods', 'Oligopeptides/*pharmacology', 'Organic Chemicals/pharmacology', 'Radiation-Protective Agents/*pharmacology']",2005/09/21 09:00,2006/02/28 09:00,['2005/09/21 09:00'],"['2005/03/15 00:00 [received]', '2005/09/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2005/09/21 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/02/28 09:00 [medline]', '2005/09/21 09:00 [entrez]']",epublish,BMC Cancer. 2005 Sep 20;5:120. doi: 10.1186/1471-2407-5-120.,,"['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Fluorescent Dyes)', '0 (Hydrocarbons, Chlorinated)', '0 (Oligopeptides)', '0 (Organic Chemicals)', '0 (PKH67)', '0 (Radiation-Protective Agents)', '00DPD30SOY (Amsacrine)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'FLR6R453DD (chlorbenside)', 'G34N38R2N1 (Bromodeoxyuridine)', 'H041538E9P (goralatide)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",,"['1471-2407-5-120 [pii]', '10.1186/1471-2407-5-120 [doi]']",,,,20050920,PMC1261258,,,,,,,,,,,

The widespread use of qRT-PCR assays for diagnosis and the detection of disease-specific prognostic markers in leukaemia patients provide further examples of their usefulness. Their value for the detection of disease-associated mRNA expressed by circulating tumour cells in patients with solid malignancies is far less apparent, and the clinical significance of results obtained from such tests remains unclear. This is because of conceptual reservations as well as technical limitations that can interfere with the diagnostic specificity of qRT-PCR assays.

The prognosis of pulmonary manifested leukemias is poor. CASE REPORT: A 57-year-old female patient was admitted to our hospital because of refractory pneumonia and the suspicion of acute leukemia. The diagnosis of acute myeloid leukemia (AML, FAB M5a) was derived from bone marrow aspiration. The radiograph and the computed tomography of the chest showed infiltrations of both lungs. The cytologic aspect of a bronchoalveolar lavage was dominated by leukemic blasts, therefore AML with pulmonary manifestation was diagnosed. Cytotoxic therapy with cytarabine/idarubicin was combined with prednisolone. In the course of treatment the pulmonary function improved and radiographic alterations diminished significantly. After induction therapy complete haematological remission (CR) was shown by bone marrow aspiration. Two consolidation therapies followed. Unfortunately, the patient died four months after CR in a local hospital. CONCLUSIONS: The pulmonary manifestation of AML can be diagnosed by bronchoscopy. In contrast to the literature the initial course of the disease in this case was favourable possibly due to the addition of prednisolone to the cytotoxic treatment.","['Schalk, E', 'Franke, A', 'Koenigsmann, M']","['Schalk E', 'Franke A', 'Koenigsmann M']","['Klinik fur Hamatologie/Onkologie, Otto-von-Guericke-Universitat Magdeburg.']",['ger'],"['Case Reports', 'English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Germany,Pneumologie,"Pneumologie (Stuttgart, Germany)",8906641,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Fatal Outcome', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*diagnosis/drug therapy', 'Lung Diseases/*etiology', 'Middle Aged']",2005/09/20 09:00,2005/11/16 09:00,['2005/09/20 09:00'],"['2005/09/20 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/11/16 09:00 [medline]', '2005/09/20 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Pneumologie. 2005 Sep;59(9):588-91. doi: 10.1055/s-2005-870987.,,,,['10.1055/s-2005-870987 [doi]'],Akute myeloische Leukamie mit pulmonaler Manifestation.,,,,,['Pneumologie. 2005 Nov;59(11):782'],,,,,,,,,,

We compared the pharmacodynamic properties of AMT (given orally at 4 mg/m2 in two divided doses per week) and MTX (100 mg/m2 in four divided doses per week) among children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia. We find AMT and MTX to have equivalent penetration into the bone marrow compartment of these patients, as indicated by the steady-state concentrations within mature red blood cells (RBCs). However, MTX concentrations in the cerebrospinal fluid after oral dosage are significantly greater than AMT. To confirm these clinical observations, mice were treated four weekly injections of AMT or MTX, at a 1:20 dosage ratio, and tissue antifolate content was then determined over the subsequent 22 days. We confirm the selective exclusion of AMT from the CNS compartment, while showing equivalent accumulation of AMT and MTX in the RBCs, liver, spleen, kidneys and testes. Finally, we demonstrate that AMT, MTX, and their predominant polyglutamate species are equipotent inhibitors of their target intracellular enzyme dihydrofolate reductase, emphasizing the critical nature of steady-state tissue accumulation in determining the relative cytotoxic potency of these two antifolates.","['Cole, Peter D', 'Zebala, John A', 'Alcaraz, Maria Jose', 'Smith, Angela K', 'Tan, John', 'Kamen, Barton A']","['Cole PD', 'Zebala JA', 'Alcaraz MJ', 'Smith AK', 'Tan J', 'Kamen BA']","['Department of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology , The Cancer Institute of New Jersey, University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey, NJ 08901, USA. colepd@umdnj.edu']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Germany,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol,Cancer chemotherapy and pharmacology,7806519,IM,"['Aminopterin/administration & dosage/cerebrospinal fluid/*pharmacokinetics', 'Animals', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/administration & dosage/cerebrospinal fluid/*pharmacokinetics', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/cerebrospinal fluid/*pharmacokinetics/pharmacology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Erythrocytes/metabolism', 'Folic Acid Antagonists/*pharmacokinetics', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Methotrexate/administration & dosage/cerebrospinal fluid/*pharmacokinetics', 'Mice', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy', 'Tetrahydrofolate Dehydrogenase/metabolism', 'Tissue Distribution']",2005/09/20 09:00,2006/07/06 09:00,['2005/09/20 09:00'],"['2005/07/10 00:00 [received]', '2005/08/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2005/09/20 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/07/06 09:00 [medline]', '2005/09/20 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol. 2006 Jun;57(6):826-34. doi: 10.1007/s00280-005-0115-3.

Since DNA methylation is considered an important mechanism for the silencing of retroelements, hypomethylation in human tumors may lead to their reactivation. However, the role of DNA hypomethylation in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) remains to be elucidated. In this study, the methylation status of the LINE-1 (L1) retrotransposon promoter was analysed in CML samples from the chronic-phase (CP, n=140) and the blast crisis (BC, n=47). L1 hypomethylation was significantly more frequent in BC (74.5%) than in CP (38%) (P<0.0001). Furthermore, L1 hypomethylation led to activation of both ORF1 sense transcription (P<0.0001) and c-MET gene antisense transcription (P<0.0001), and was significantly associated with high levels of BCR-ABL (P=0.02) and DNMT3b4 (P=0.001) transcripts. Interestingly, in CP-CML, extensive L1 hypomethylation was associated with poorer prognosis in terms of cytogenetic response to interferon (P=0.004) or imatinib (P=0.034) and progression-free survival (P=0.005). The above results strongly suggest that activation of both sense and antisense transcriptions by aberrant promoter hypomethylation of the L1 elements plays a role in the progression and clinical behavior of the CML.","['Roman-Gomez, Jose', 'Jimenez-Velasco, Antonio', 'Agirre, Xabier', 'Cervantes, Francisco', 'Sanchez, Joaquin', 'Garate, Leire', 'Barrios, Manuel', 'Castillejo, Juan A', 'Navarro, German', 'Colomer, Dolors', 'Prosper, Felipe', 'Heiniger, Anabel', 'Torres, Antonio']","['Roman-Gomez J', 'Jimenez-Velasco A', 'Agirre X', 'Cervantes F', 'Sanchez J', 'Garate L', 'Barrios M', 'Castillejo JA', 'Navarro G', 'Colomer D', 'Prosper F', 'Heiniger A', 'Torres A']","['Hematology Department, Reina Sofia Hospital, Avda.

The phenomenon of hematopoietic reconstitution after autologous HCT and the role of proliferative stress in the pathogenesis of t-MDS/AML are poorly understood. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Using a prospective longitudinal study design, we evaluated the nature and timing of alterations in hematopoietic progenitors and telomere length after HCT in patients undergoing autologous HCT at City of Hope Cancer Center (Duarte, CA). RESULTS: A significant reduction in primitive and committed progenitors was observed before HCT compared with healthy controls. Further profound and persistent reduction in primitive progenitors but only transient reduction in committed progenitors were seen after HCT. Primitive progenitor frequency in pre-HCT marrow and peripheral-blood stem cells predicted for primitive progenitor recovery after HCT. Shortening of telomere length was observed in marrow cells early after HCT, with subsequent restoration to pre-HCT levels. Patients within this cohort who developed t-MDS/AML had reduced recovery of committed progenitors and poorer telomere recovery, possibly indicating a functional defect in primitive hematopoietic cells. CONCLUSION: Our studies suggest that hematopoietic regeneration after HCT is associated with increased proliferation and differentiation of primitive progenitors. Increased proliferative stress on stem cells bearing genotoxic damage could contribute to the pathogenesis of t-MDS/AML. Extended follow-up of a larger number of patients is required to confirm whether alterations in progenitor and telomere recovery predict for increased risk of t-MDS/AML.","['Bhatia, Ravi', 'Van Heijzen, Khristine', 'Palmer, Ann', 'Komiya, Asako', 'Slovak, Marilyn L', 'Chang, Karen L', 'Fung, Henry', 'Krishnan, Amrita', 'Molina, Arturo', 'Nademanee, Auayporn', ""O'Donnell, Margaret"", 'Popplewell, Leslie', 'Rodriguez, Roberto', 'Forman, Stephen J', 'Bhatia, Smita']","['Bhatia R', 'Van Heijzen K', 'Palmer A', 'Komiya A', 'Slovak ML', 'Chang KL', 'Fung H', 'Krishnan A', 'Molina A', 'Nademanee A', ""O'Donnell M"", 'Popplewell L', 'Rodriguez R', 'Forman SJ', 'Bhatia S']","['Division of Hematology and Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation, City of Hope National Medical Center, Duarte, CA 91010, USA. rbhatia@coh.org']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Graft Rejection', 'Graft Survival', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*adverse effects/methods', 'Hematopoietic System/*pathology', 'Hodgkin Disease/diagnosis/mortality/*therapy', 'Humans', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/diagnosis/mortality/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Probability', 'Prospective Studies', 'Risk Assessment', 'Statistics, Nonparametric', 'Stem Cells/*physiology', 'Survival Analysis', 'Transplantation Conditioning/methods', 'Transplantation, Autologous', 'Treatment Outcome']",2005/09/20 09:00,2005/10/28 09:00,['2005/09/20 09:00'],"['2005/09/20 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/10/28 09:00 [medline]', '2005/09/20 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2005 Sep 20;23(27):6699-711. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2005.10.330.,"['5M01 RR00043/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA30206/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,"['23/27/6699 [pii]', '10.1200/JCO.2005.10.330 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

AIMS: To conduct a population based, case-control study of death certificate data from 1984 to 1998 in 24 US states in order to evaluate the risk of mortality from LH neoplasms associated with occupational exposure to animals or the public. METHODS: Cases were selected as those with an underlying cause of death of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL, n = 72,589), Hodgkin's disease (HD, n = 5479), multiple myeloma (n = 35,857), or leukaemia (n = 68,598); 912 615 controls were randomly selected from all remaining deaths, frequency matched on age, sex, race, and geographic region. RESULTS: Occupational exposure to animals was associated with modest increased risks of mortality from all four LH cancers; these associations varied by region. Occupational exposure to the public was associated with only negligible increased risk with LH cancer outcomes. Occupations involving animal exposure were predominantly agricultural, and the risks associated with employment in the livestock industry exceeded the corresponding risks associated with the crop industry for all outcomes except HD. CONCLUSIONS: Increased risks of NHL, HD, multiple myeloma, and leukaemia were associated with occupations that involved animal exposure. Regional differences in risk imply that the risks may be associated with exposure to specific livestock or farming practices. However, these associations may be confounded by other farming related exposures, such as pesticides. Because the use of death certificates to classify occupation may result in misclassification during aetiologically relevant time periods, these hypotheses should be further explored in studies with detailed information on lifetime occupation.","['Svec, M A', 'Ward, M H', 'Dosemeci, M', 'Checkoway, H', 'De Roos, A J']","['Svec MA', 'Ward MH', 'Dosemeci M', 'Checkoway H', 'De Roos AJ']","['Department of Epidemiology, University of Washington, Seattle, Washington, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Occup Environ Med,Occupational and environmental medicine,9422759,IM,"[""Agricultural Workers' Diseases/*etiology/microbiology"", 'Animals', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Communicable Diseases/complications/*transmission', 'Death Certificates', 'Disease Transmission, Infectious', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*etiology/microbiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/etiology/microbiology', 'Lymphoma/etiology/microbiology', 'Occupational Diseases/*etiology/microbiology', '*Occupational Exposure', 'Registries', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Factors', 'United States/epidemiology', 'Zoonoses']",2005/09/20 09:00,2005/12/13 09:00,['2005/09/20 09:00'],"['2005/09/20 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/12/13 09:00 [medline]', '2005/09/20 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Occup Environ Med. 2005 Oct;62(10):726-35. doi: 10.1136/oem.2005.021550.,,,,"['62/10/726 [pii]', '10.1136/oem.2005.021550 [doi]']",,,,,PMC1740863,,,,,,,,,,,

Characterizing important downstream target genes of MLL and of MLL fusion proteins may provide rational therapeutic strategies for the treatment of MLL-associated leukemia. We explored downstream target genes of the most prevalent MLL fusion protein, MLL-AF4. To this end, we developed inducible MLL-AF4 fusion cell lines in different backgrounds. Overexpression of MLL-AF4 does not lead to increased proliferation in either cell line, but rather, cell growth was slowed compared with similar cell lines inducibly expressing truncated MLL. We found that in the MLL-AF4-induced cell lines, the expression of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor gene CDKN1B was dramatically changed at both the RNA and protein (p27kip1) levels. In contrast, the expression levels of CDKN1A (p21) and CDKN2A (p16) were unchanged. To explore whether CDKN1B might be a direct target of MLL and of MLL-AF4, we used chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays and luciferase reporter gene assays. MLL-AF4 binds to the CDKN1B promoter in vivo and regulates CDKN1B promoter activity. Further, we confirmed CDKN1B promoter binding by ChIP in MLL-AF4 as well as in MLL-AF9 leukemia cell lines. Our results suggest that CDKN1B is a downstream target of MLL and of MLL-AF4, and that, depending on the background cell type, MLL-AF4 inhibits or activates CDKN1B expression. This finding may have implications in terms of leukemia stem cell resistance to chemotherapy in MLL-AF4 leukemias.","['Xia, Zhen-Biao', 'Popovic, Relja', 'Chen, Jing', 'Theisler, Catherine', 'Stuart, Tara', 'Santillan, Donna A', 'Erfurth, Frank', 'Diaz, Manuel O', 'Zeleznik-Le, Nancy J']","['Xia ZB', 'Popovic R', 'Chen J', 'Theisler C', 'Stuart T', 'Santillan DA', 'Erfurth F', 'Diaz MO', 'Zeleznik-Le NJ']","['Department of Medicine, Molecular Biology Program, and Oncology Institute, Cardinal Bernardin Cancer Center, Loyola University Medical Center, Maywood, IL 60153, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,IM,"['Cell Line', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Chromatin Immunoprecipitation', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p27/*genetics/metabolism', 'Down-Regulation', '*Gene Expression Regulation', 'Humans', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Lymphocytes/metabolism', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/*metabolism', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*metabolism', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Up-Regulation']",2005/09/20 09:00,2005/12/13 09:00,['2005/09/20 09:00'],"['2005/09/20 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/12/13 09:00 [medline]', '2005/09/20 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2005 Sep 27;102(39):14028-33. doi: 10.1073/pnas.0506464102.

To evaluate the functions of glycosphingolipids (GSLs) in neural precursor cells, neuroepithelial cells (NECs) were prepared from mouse embryos (E14.5), and the effects of an inhibitor of glucosylceramide synthesis, D-threo-1-phenyl-2-decanoylamino-3-morpholino-1-propanol (PDMP), on NECs was investigated. In PDMP-treated NECs, the expression of GD3, a major ganglioside of NECs, disappeared. We found that basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF)-induced proliferation and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) activation were repressed in PDMP-treated NECs. Leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF)-induced ERK activation was also abolished in PDMP-treated NECs, suggesting that PDMP specifically represses the Ras-MAPK pathway. bFGF-induced activation of the Ras-MAPK pathway in NECs is dependent on GSL-enriched microdomains, lipid rafts. The organization of lipid rafts and the distribution of Ras and Grb2-SOS in the microdomains were not affected. However, Ras activation was repressed in PDMP-treated NECs. In PDMP-treated NECs, some neuronal genes were up-regulated and glial genes were down-regulated. These results suggest that GSLs might be involved in the proliferation, survival, signal transduction and differentiation of NECs.","['Yanagisawa, Makoto', 'Nakamura, Kazuo', 'Taga, Tetsuya']","['Yanagisawa M', 'Nakamura K', 'Taga T']","['21st Century COE program, Cell Fate Regulation Research and Education Unit, Institute of Molecular Embryology and Genetics, Kumamoto University, Honjo 2-2-1, Kumamoto 860-0811, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,J Biochem,Journal of biochemistry,0376600,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cytokines/*metabolism', 'Embryo, Mammalian', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases/metabolism', 'Fibroblast Growth Factor 2/pharmacology', 'Gangliosides/metabolism', 'Glycosphingolipids/*metabolism', 'Interleukin-6/metabolism', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'MAP Kinase Signaling System/*physiology', 'Membrane Microdomains/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Morpholines/*pharmacology', 'Neuroepithelial Cells/cytology/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Stem Cells/cytology/physiology', 'ras Proteins/*metabolism']",2005/09/20 09:00,2005/12/13 09:00,['2005/09/20 09:00'],"['2005/09/20 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/12/13 09:00 [medline]', '2005/09/20 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Biochem. 2005 Sep;138(3):285-91. doi: 10.1093/jb/mvi129.,,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Gangliosides)', '0 (Glycosphingolipids)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', '0 (Morpholines)', '103107-01-3 (Fibroblast Growth Factor 2)', '62010-37-1 (ganglioside, GD3)', '73257-80-4 (RV 538)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (ras Proteins)']",,"['138/3/285 [pii]', '10.1093/jb/mvi129 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Traumatic lumbar puncture (TLP) is thought to increase the risk of CNS relapse. The authors examined whether TLP at the time of diagnosis affected outcome and whether this effect was influenced by the timing of intrathecal therapy (IT) in 77 patients with newly diagnosed ALL. IT was instilled at the time of either the diagnostic LP (early) or a second LP 24--48 h later (delayed). Of the 19 patients who had a TLP at diagnosis and received late IT therapy, 6 had isolated CNS relapse and 2 had combined CNS and bone marrow (BM) relapse. Of the 9 patients who had TLP and received early IT therapy, 1 had a CNS relapse (p=.20). In an analysis stratified according to risk of relapse, the odds ratio (OR) for relapse was 0.8 among patients at low and standard risk who had delayed IT therapy after TLP (p=.99) vs. 0.17 for those who had early IT (p=.47). Importantly, among patients with high-risk ALL, the OR for relapse was 21.0 for delayed IT therapy (p=.09) and only 1.5 for early IT therapy after TLP (p=.99). The results indicate that TLP at diagnosis appears to increase the risk of CNS relapse markedly in patients with high-risk ALL, and the use of early IT therapy appears to reduce this risk. These findings need to be confirmed by prospective, randomized studies.","['Rech, Angela', 'de Carvalho, Gisele P', 'Meneses, Clarice F', 'Hankins, Jane', 'Howard, Scott', 'Brunetto, Algemir L']","['Rech A', 'de Carvalho GP', 'Meneses CF', 'Hankins J', 'Howard S', 'Brunetto AL']","['Pediatric Oncology Unit, Hospital de Clinicas de Porto Alegre, Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul, Porto Alegre, Brazil. arech@hcpa.ufrgs.br']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Pediatr Hematol Oncol,Pediatric hematology and oncology,8700164,IM,"['Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Injections, Spinal', 'Lumbar Vertebrae/*injuries', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/complications/diagnosis/*therapy', 'Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic', 'Recurrence', 'Risk Factors', '*Spinal Fractures/diagnosis']",2005/09/20 09:00,2006/01/04 09:00,['2005/09/20 09:00'],"['2005/09/20 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/01/04 09:00 [medline]', '2005/09/20 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Pediatr Hematol Oncol. 2005 Sep;22(6):483-8. doi: 10.1080/08880010591002242.,,,,"['M868334631353537 [pii]', '10.1080/08880010591002242 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Therefore, we investigated the expression of OSM protein and its specific receptor subunits, OSMRbeta and LIFRbeta in normal and cirrhotic human liver using immunohistochemical and Western blot analysis. RESULTS: OSM protein was expressed in Kupffer cells, variably in normal liver but consistently in cirrhosis. OSMRbeta was expressed at low level in hepatocytes of all normal livers examined, but in no cirrhotic sample. In contrast, LIFRbeta receptor was expressed weakly in normal livers, but much more intensely in cirrhosis, in reactive ductules, bile duct epithelial cells and perisinusoidal areas. Double immunostaining showed co-localization of LIFRbeta with cytokeratin 7, proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) and leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), in bile duct epithelial cells, but not with alpha-smooth muscle actin, a myofibroblast marker. CONCLUSIONS: In human liver, OSM protein is expressed in Kupffer cells, variably in normals but universally in cirrhosis. The differential expression pattern of OSM and its receptors could allow for differential OSM signaling by alternative utilization of receptors to promote hepatocyte proliferation in acute injury and, with its homologue LIF, for the bile ductular reaction in cirrhosis.","['Znoyko, Iya', 'Sohara, Naondo', 'Spicer, Samuel S', 'Trojanowska, Maria', 'Reuben, Adrian']","['Znoyko I', 'Sohara N', 'Spicer SS', 'Trojanowska M', 'Reuben A']","['Division of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Department of Medicine, Medical University of South Carolina, Charleston, South Carolina 29425, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Netherlands,J Hepatol,Journal of hepatology,8503886,IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/metabolism', '*Gene Expression', 'Growth Inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Hepatocytes/cytology/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Inflammation Mediators/metabolism', 'Keratin-7', 'Keratins/metabolism', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor Receptor alpha Subunit', 'Liver/cytology/metabolism', 'Liver Cirrhosis/*metabolism/pathology', 'Oncostatin M', 'Peptides/*metabolism', 'Protein Subunits/metabolism', 'Receptors, Cytokine/*metabolism', 'Receptors, OSM-LIF', 'Receptors, Oncostatin M']",2005/09/20 09:00,2006/02/10 09:00,['2005/09/20 09:00'],"['2004/12/16 00:00 [received]', '2005/03/15 00:00 [revised]', '2005/04/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2005/09/20 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/02/10 09:00 [medline]', '2005/09/20 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Hepatol. 2005 Nov;43(5):893-900. doi: 10.1016/j.jhep.2005.04.020.

Localization of mFPGS within mitochondria may help elucidate how the enzyme functions to maintain the mitochondrial folate pool. A human T-lymphoblastic leukemia CCRF-CEM cell lysate was fractionated by differential centrifugation into cytosolic and mitochondrial fractions. Activity assays for cytosol-and mitochondria-specific enzymes verified the purity and integrity of the fractions. Mitochondria were subfractionated with increasing concentrations of digitonin to successively extract the four submitochondrial compartments. Western analyses of the fractions using protein markers specific for each compartment suggest that mFPGS is distributed in the matrix and/or inner membrane compartments. Further support for an interaction of mFPGS with the inner mitochondrial membrane is provided by localization of about half of the mFPGS in the mitochondrial membrane fraction obtained by freeze-thaw of intact mitochondria; the remaining mFPGS is located in the soluble fraction. Resistance of about half of the mFPGS in whole mitochondria to alkaline carbonate extraction suggests that its interaction with the inner membrane is more similar to an integral, than a peripheral, membrane protein. The data suggest that human mFPGS is at least in part strongly associated with the inner mitochondrial membrane.","['Nair, Jayakumar R', 'McGuire, John J']","['Nair JR', 'McGuire JJ']","['Department of Pharmacology and Therapeutics, Roswell Park Cancer Institute, Elm and Carlton Streets, Buffalo, NY 14263, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",Netherlands,Biochim Biophys Acta,Biochimica et biophysica acta,0217513,IM,"['Carbonates/pharmacology', 'Cell Extracts', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Digitonin/pharmacology', 'Freezing', 'Humans', 'Isoenzymes/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*enzymology/*pathology', 'Peptide Synthases/*metabolism', 'Submitochondrial Particles/drug effects/*enzymology']",2005/09/20 09:00,2005/12/15 09:00,['2005/09/20 09:00'],"['2005/05/05 00:00 [received]', '2005/08/20 00:00 [revised]', '2005/08/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2005/09/20 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/12/15 09:00 [medline]', '2005/09/20 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Biochim Biophys Acta. 2005 Oct 30;1746(1):38-44. doi: 10.1016/j.bbamcr.2005.08.004.

However, the BCR-ABL translocation may occur via a number of different junction points. In addition, CML is a disease of hematopoietic stem cells and, as a result, can give rise to multiple lineages of tumor cells. In this study, we examined the cellular signaling profiles following imatinib mesylate treatment of eight model CML and ALL cell lines that encompass three BCR-ABL junction points and multiple lineages. We used phosphorylation-specific antibodies and flow cytometry to determine the kinase and pathway activation states with each of the cell lines before and after imatinib mesylate exposure. The comparisons of signaling response profiles, junction points and lineages indicate that cell line lineage rather than BCR-ABL junction point may determine cellular response to imatinib mesylate. The large amount of variation observed among the cell lines suggests that further analysis is required to understand the complex signaling profiles present in CML patients.","['Wetzel, Randy', 'Goss, Valerie L', 'Norris, Brett', 'Popova, Lana', 'Melnick, Michael', 'Smith, Bradley L']","['Wetzel R', 'Goss VL', 'Norris B', 'Popova L', 'Melnick M', 'Smith BL']","['Cell Signaling Technology, 166B Cummings Center, Beverly, MA 01915, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Netherlands,J Immunol Methods,Journal of immunological methods,1305440,IM,"['Animals', 'Benzamides', '*Cell Line, Tumor', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*genetics/metabolism', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Piperazines/*pharmacology', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Pyrimidines/*pharmacology', 'Signal Transduction']",2005/09/20 09:00,2005/12/15 09:00,['2005/09/20 09:00'],"['2005/06/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2005/09/20 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/12/15 09:00 [medline]', '2005/09/20 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Immunol Methods. 2005 Oct 20;305(1):59-66. doi: 10.1016/j.jim.2005.07.012.

The mAbs reacted weakly also with human umbilical vein endothelial cells and the basophilic leukemia KU-812. Immunohistology revealed staining of epithelia and endothelia on sections of tonsils. In FACS analyses NONI-B4 competed with MIMA-52 for binding to Do/ART4-transfected cells and erythrocytes, whereas NONI-B63 competed with MIMA-53.

METHODS: In this study, we employed a job exposure matrix (JEM) to assess exposures to other known or suspected carcinogens-including trichloroethylene (TCE), polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), mineral oils, and benzene-on cancer mortality (1960-2001) and incidence (1988-2000) in 6,107 male workers. We derived rate- (hazard-) ratios estimates from Cox proportional hazard models with time-dependent exposures. RESULTS: High levels of TCE exposure were positively associated with cancer incidence of the bladder (rate ratio (RR): 1.98, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.93-4.22) and kidney (4.90; 1.23-19.6). High levels of exposure to mineral oils increased mortality and incidence of lung cancer (1.56; 1.02-2.39 and 1.99; 1.03-3.85), and incidence of melanoma (3.32; 1.20-9.24). Mineral oil exposures also contributed to incidence and mortality of esophageal and stomach cancers and of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and leukemia when adjusting for other chemical exposures. Lagging exposure measures by 20 years changed effect estimates only minimally. No associations were observed for benzene or PAH exposures in this cohort. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that these aerospace workers who were highly exposed to mineral oils experienced an increased risk of developing and/or dying from cancers of the lung, melanoma, and possibly from cancers of the esophagus and stomach and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and leukemia. These results and the increases we observed for TCE and kidney cancers are consistent with findings of previous studies.","['Zhao, Yingxu', 'Krishnadasan, Anusha', 'Kennedy, Nola', 'Morgenstern, Hal', 'Ritz, Beate']","['Zhao Y', 'Krishnadasan A', 'Kennedy N', 'Morgenstern H', 'Ritz B']","['Department of Epidemiology, School of Public Health, UCLA, Los Angeles, California, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Am J Ind Med,American journal of industrial medicine,8101110,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', '*Aviation', 'California/epidemiology', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Male', 'Mineral Oil/*toxicity', 'Neoplasms/chemically induced/*epidemiology/mortality', 'Occupational Diseases/chemically induced/*epidemiology/mortality', '*Occupational Health', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Assessment', 'Solvents/*toxicity']",2005/09/17 09:00,2006/02/02 09:00,['2005/09/17 09:00'],"['2005/09/17 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/02/02 09:00 [medline]', '2005/09/17 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Am J Ind Med. 2005 Oct;48(4):249-58. doi: 10.1002/ajim.20216.,,"['0 (Solvents)', '8020-83-5 (Mineral Oil)']",,['10.1002/ajim.20216 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we discuss how the histone code may be disrupted by chromosomal translocations, either directly by altering the activity of histone modifying enzymes, or indirectly by recruitment of this type of enzyme by oncogenic transcription factors. These alterations in the histone code may alter gene expression pattern to set the stage for leukemogenesis.","['Linggi, Bryan E', 'Brandt, Stephen J', 'Sun, Zu-Wen', 'Hiebert, Scott W']","['Linggi BE', 'Brandt SJ', 'Sun ZW', 'Hiebert SW']","['Department of Biochemistry, Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, Nashville, Tennessee 37232, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", 'Review']",United States,J Cell Biochem,Journal of cellular biochemistry,8205768,IM,"['Amino Acid Motifs', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Chromatin/chemistry', 'Chromosomes/ultrastructure', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit/metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/metabolism', 'Histone Acetyltransferases/metabolism', 'Histone Deacetylases/chemistry', 'Histones/*chemistry/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*genetics/*metabolism/*pathology', 'Models, Biological', 'Models, Molecular', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-6', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/chemistry', '*Translocation, Genetic']",2005/09/17 09:00,2006/03/21 09:00,['2005/09/17 09:00'],"['2005/09/17 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/03/21 09:00 [medline]', '2005/09/17 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Cell Biochem. 2005 Dec 1;96(5):938-50. doi: 10.1002/jcb.20604.,"['CA68485/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01-CA112005/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01-CA64140/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01-CA77274/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01-CA87549/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01-HL49118/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']","['0 (BCL6 protein, human)', '0 (Chromatin)', '0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Histones)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-6)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', 'EC 2.3.1.48 (Histone Acetyltransferases)', 'EC 3.5.1.98 (Histone Deacetylases)']",75,['10.1002/jcb.20604 [doi]'],,"['2005 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Our study was aimed to investigate whether mutations in the ATM gene occur in childhood T-lineage acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (T-ALL) that are linked to drug resistance and clinical outcome. In all, 20 different single nucleotide substitutions were found in 16 exons of ATM in 62/103 (60%) T-ALL children and 51/99 (52%, P = 0.21) controls. Besides the well-known polymorphism D1853N, five other alterations (S707P, F858L, P1054R, L1472W, Y1475C) in the coding part of ATM were found. These five coding alterations seem to occur more frequently in T-ALL (13%) than controls (5%, P = 0.06), but did not associate with altered expression levels of ATM or in vitro resistance to daunorubicin. However, T-ALL patients carrying these five coding alterations presented with a higher white blood cell count at diagnosis (P = 0.05) and show an increased relapse-risk (5-year probability of disease-free survival (pDFS) = 48%) compared to patients with other alterations or wild-type ATM (5-year pDFS = 76%, P = 0.05). The association between five coding ATM alterations in T-ALL, their germline presence, white blood cell count and unfavourable outcome may point to a role for ATM in the development of T-ALL in these children.","['Meier, M', 'den Boer, M L', 'Hall, A G', 'Irving, J A E', 'Passier, M', 'Minto, L', 'van Wering, E R', 'Janka-Schaub, G E', 'Pieters, R']","['Meier M', 'den Boer ML', 'Hall AG', 'Irving JA', 'Passier M', 'Minto L', 'van Wering ER', 'Janka-Schaub GE', 'Pieters R']","[""Department of Paediatric Oncology/Haematology, Erasmus MC/Sophia Children's Hospital, Erasmus University Medical Centre, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/pharmacology', 'Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated Proteins', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cell Cycle Proteins/*genetics', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics', 'Daunorubicin/pharmacology', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*drug therapy/*genetics/pathology', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Phenotype', '*Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide', 'Prognosis', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/*genetics', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Risk Factors', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/*genetics']",2005/09/17 09:00,2005/11/16 09:00,['2005/09/17 09:00'],"['2005/09/17 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/11/16 09:00 [medline]', '2005/09/17 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2005 Nov;19(11):1887-95. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2403943.,,"['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (ATM protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",,"['2403943 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.leu.2403943 [doi]']",,,,,,,['Leukemia. 2006 Mar;20(3):526-7; author reply 527.

A hospital-based case-control study of 354 adult de novo MDS cases and 452 controls was conducted to investigate associations between lifestyle characteristics and MDS risk. The distribution by French-American-British (FAB) type was 67 (19%) refractory anemia (RA), 38 (11%) refractory anemia with ringed sideroblasts (RARS), 43 (12%) chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML), 136 (38%) RA with excess blasts (RAEB), and 70 (20%) RAEB in transformation (RAEBT). Multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed among all MDS cases and among each FAB type and gender. For all MDS combined, family history of hematopoietic cancer (odds ratio (OR) = 1.92), smoking (OR = 1.65), and exposure to agricultural chemicals (OR = 4.55) or solvents (OR = 2.05) were associated with MDS risk. Among RA/RARS cases, smoking (OR = 2.23) and agricultural chemical exposure (OR = 5.68) were the only risk factors identified. For RAEB/RAEBT cases, family history of hematopoietic cancer (OR = 2.10), smoking (OR = 1.52), and exposure to agricultural chemicals (OR = 3.79) or solvents (OR = 2.71) were independent risk factors. Drinking wine reduced risk for all FAB types by almost 50% (OR = 0.54). We found a joint effect between smoking and chemical exposure with the highest risk among smokers exposed to solvents/agricultural chemicals (OR = 3.22). Results from this large study suggest that several factors play a role in MDS predisposition with possible joint effects.

Hematological malignancies were the most common primary (53%), followed by breast and ovarian cancer (30% combined). The mean latency until the development of t-AML was 45.5 months. Median survival was 10 months. Cytogenetics was abnormal in 89% of pts. FLT3 internal tandem duplications were found in six of 41 (14.6%) pts, of whom four had an abnormal karyotype. Analysis of drug metabolism and disposition genes showed a protective effect of the CYP3A4 1*B genotype against the development of t-leuk/MDS, whereas the CC genotype of MDR1 C3435T and the NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase1 codon 187 polymorphism were both noncontributory. Microsatellite instability (MSI) analysis using fluoresceinated PCR with ABI sequence analyzer demonstrated that 41% of pts had high levels of MSI in four or more of 10 microsatellite loci.

In order to overcome this, alternative or additional targeting of signaling pathways downstream of Bcr-Abl may provide the best option for improving clinical response. Bisphosphonates, such as zoledronate, have been shown to inhibit the oncogenicity of Ras, an important downstream effector of Bcr-Abl. In this study, we show that zoledronate is equally effective in inhibiting the proliferation and clonogenicity of both imatinib-sensitive and -resistant CML cells, regardless of their mechanism of resistance. This is achieved by the induction of S-phase cell cycle arrest and apoptosis, through the inhibition of prenylation of Ras and Ras-related proteins by zoledronate. The combination of imatinib and zoledronate also augmented the activity of either drug alone and this occurred in imatinib-resistant CML cells as well. Since zoledronate is already available for clinical use, these results suggest that it may be an effective addition to the armamentarium of drugs for the treatment of CML.","['Chuah, C', 'Barnes, D J', 'Kwok, M', 'Corbin, A', 'Deininger, M W N', 'Druker, B J', 'Melo, J V']","['Chuah C', 'Barnes DJ', 'Kwok M', 'Corbin A', 'Deininger MW', 'Druker BJ', 'Melo JV']","['Imperial College London, Hammersmith Hospital, London, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Benzamides', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Proliferation/*drug effects', 'Diphosphonates/*pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Genes, abl/physiology', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Imidazoles/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*pathology', 'Piperazines/pharmacology', 'Pyrimidines/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Zoledronic Acid']",2005/09/17 09:00,2005/11/16 09:00,['2005/09/17 09:00'],"['2005/09/17 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/11/16 09:00 [medline]', '2005/09/17 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2005 Nov;19(11):1896-904. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2403949.,,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Diphosphonates)', '0 (Imidazoles)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '6XC1PAD3KF (Zoledronic Acid)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)']",,"['2403949 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.leu.2403949 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

GISTs have an extraordinarily high rate of recurrence after surgical resection and are highly resistant to radiation and standard chemotherapy. The discovery that constitutive activation of the c-kit gene drives malignant behavior in GISTs exposed a weakness that was soon exploited through the application of the novel targeted therapy imatinib, a small-molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor of Bcr-Abl, KIT, and the platelet-derived growth factor receptor-alpha and -beta. Imatinib had shown unparalleled results in patients with advanced chronic myelogenous leukemia (remission rates approaching 98%), and the first GIST patients treated with imatinib demonstrated dramatic response rates unseen with other therapeutic modalities. Thousands of patients worldwide with advanced GIST have been treated with imatinib, with the demonstration of significant response rates, prolongation of survival, and improvement in quality of life. Studies of imatinib in both the neoadjuvant and adjuvant settings are now being conducted to evaluate whether low rates of cure with surgical resection alone can be improved. Additionally, multiple new targeted agents are being tested in patients with imatinib-resistant GIST. The gains that have been made in the treatment of GIST through the use of imatinib have helped to open the door to a new era of development of targeted therapeutic agents in oncology.

We review the molecular biology and evolution of treatment of the blastic phase of CML.","['Morris, Evelyn L', 'Dutcher, Janice P']","['Morris EL', 'Dutcher JP']","['New York Medical College, Bronx, NY 10466, USA.']",['eng'],"['Historical Article', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,Clin Adv Hematol Oncol,Clinical advances in hematology & oncology : H&O,101167661,IM,"['*Blast Crisis/history/metabolism/pathology/therapy', 'History, 20th Century', 'History, 21st Century', 'Humans', '*Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/history/metabolism/pathology/therapy', 'Remission Induction']",2005/09/17 09:00,2006/10/06 09:00,['2005/09/17 09:00'],"['2005/09/17 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/10/06 09:00 [medline]', '2005/09/17 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Clin Adv Hematol Oncol. 2005 Jul;3(7):547-52.,,,53,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is characterized by the accumulation of granulocytic cells blocked at the promyelocytic stage of differentiation in the bone marrow and the peripheral blood, life-threatening coagulopathy, and a remarkable response to treatment with all-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA), arsenic trioxide, and anthracyclines. Current treatment strategies with ATRA and anthracycline-based chemotherapy has dramatically transformed APL into the most curable of all acute leukemias. Advances in supportive care together with the early recognition of treatment-related complications have also contributed significantly to increased cure rates. In this review we explore current treatment strategies in the management of newly diagnosed APL. We also highlight practical points that may serve as a guideline for the treating physician and address current controversies in the choice of treatment.","['Sirulnik, L Andres', 'Stone, Richard M']","['Sirulnik LA', 'Stone RM']","['Dept. of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, 44 Binney Street, Boston, MA 02116, USA.

We observed extreme elevations of homocysteine in a 9-year-old boy presenting with leukemia treated with the ALL-BFM 95 protocol. Coma occurred at about the 71st hour from the first methotrexate administration, and lasted for 30 h but MRI and CT studies showed no intracranial pathology. The second course of high-dose methotrexate was administered with no complications. Homocysteine areas under the curve (AUC) were calculated as the sum of areas of rectangles during the 6-hour intervals from T(0) to T(72) hours (AUC(0--72)) and methotrexate AUCs were evaluated using MW/PHARM 3.3 software. The AUC of homocysteine during the first, toxic course was 5.2 times higher than AUC during the second administration, whereas AUC of methotrexate also differed by a factor of 5. Plasma concentrations of folate prior to the first and the second courses, respectively, were 4.4 versus 45 micromol/l making this difference the most striking discriminator between the two courses. Mutation analysis showed that the patient was heterozygous for the C 677 T mutation in the MTHFR gene. We suggest that plasma homocysteine, pretreatment plasma folate and possibly the presence of MTHFR mutations may be biomarkers of methotrexate toxicity and possibly its antifolate effect targeted towards the tumor as well.","['Valik, Dalibor', 'Sterba, Jaroslav', 'Bajciova, Viera', 'Demlova, Regina']","['Valik D', 'Sterba J', 'Bajciova V', 'Demlova R']","['Department of Laboratory Medicine, Masaryk Memorial Cancer Institute, Brno, Czech Republic. valik@mou.cz']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Switzerland,Oncology,Oncology,0135054,IM,"['Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Brain/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Brain Diseases, Metabolic/*chemically induced/metabolism', 'Child', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Folic Acid/*blood/drug effects', 'Folic Acid Antagonists/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Homocysteine/*blood/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Methotrexate/*administration & dosage/*adverse effects', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/blood/*drug therapy/*metabolism']",2005/09/17 09:00,2005/11/03 09:00,['2005/09/17 09:00'],"['2005/04/01 00:00 [received]', '2005/05/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2005/09/17 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/11/03 09:00 [medline]', '2005/09/17 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Oncology. 2005;69(3):269-72. doi: 10.1159/000088334.

RESULTS: Complete response was achieved in 20 of 30 patients treated with radiotherapy, 19 of 32 who were treated with chemotherapy and 30 of 34 in the combined arm (p<0.01). Actuarial curves at 10 years showed that event-free survival was 50, 57 and 83%, respectively (p<0.01). Actuarial curves for overall survival were 50, 50 and 76% (p<0.01), respectively. The most common site of relapse was the central nervous system. Acute toxicity was mild. Until now, no second neoplasm or acute leukemia has been observed.

The European Collaboration Group on Myelofibrosis with Myeloid Metaplasia reviewed patients who received at least four weeks' thalidomide treatment, in doses ranging from 50 mg/day to 400 mg/day. The results showed that 30% of patients had increases in haemoglobin, and, of these, almost 40% became transfusion independent. Platelets were increased in a significant proportion of patients, and approximately 40% of patients had a reduction in their spleen size. Data on thalidomide and acute myeloblastic leukaemia (AML) are conflicting: a recently published study indicated that thalidomide does not have a role in the management of acute myeloblastic leukaemia (AML), while other studies suggest some patients may respond because of thalidomide's ability to activate natural killer cells and cytotoxic T-lymphocytes. Partial responses to thalidomide treatment have been recorded in patients with lymphoma. In a phase II study to assess the activity of thalidomide in patients with Waldenstrom's macroglobulinaemia, a partial response was seen in 25% of patients who received a starting dose of 200 mg, which was escalated in 200 mg increments every 14 days as tolerated to a maximum of 600 mg.

How GATA1 coordinates these fundamental processes is unclear. Previous studies of synthetic and naturally occurring mutant GATA1 molecules demonstrate that DNA-binding and interaction with the essential GATA1 cofactor FOG-1 (via the N-terminal finger) are required for gene expression in terminally differentiating megakaryocytes and for platelet production. Moreover, acquired mutations deleting the N-terminal 84 amino acids are specifically detected in megakaryocytic leukemia in human Down syndrome patients. In this study, we have systematically dissected GATA1 domains required for platelet release and control of megakaryocyte growth by ectopically expressing modified GATA1 molecules in primary GATA1-deficient fetal megakaryocyte progenitors. In addition to DNA binding, distinct N-terminal regions, including residues in the first 84 amino acids, promote platelet release and restrict megakaryocyte growth. In contrast, abrogation of GATA1-FOG-1 interaction leads to loss of differentiation, but growth of blocked immature megakaryocytes is controlled. Thus, distinct GATA1 domains regulate terminal megakaryocyte gene expression leading to platelet release and restrain megakaryocyte growth, and these processes can be uncoupled.","['Kuhl, Christiane', 'Atzberger, Ann', 'Iborra, Francisco', 'Nieswandt, Bernhard', 'Porcher, Catherine', 'Vyas, Paresh']","['Kuhl C', 'Atzberger A', 'Iborra F', 'Nieswandt B', 'Porcher C', 'Vyas P']","['Department of Hematology, Weatherall Institute of Molecular Medicine, University of Oxford and John Radcliffe Hospital, Oxford OX3 9DU, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Antigens, CD/biosynthesis', 'Blood Platelets/metabolism', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cell Separation', 'Chickens', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'DNA/chemistry', 'Flow Cytometry', 'GATA1 Transcription Factor/chemistry/metabolism/*physiology', 'Green Fluorescent Proteins/metabolism', 'Megakaryocytes/*cytology/metabolism', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/biosynthesis', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Microscopy, Fluorescence', 'Models, Genetic', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutation', 'Phenotype', 'Platelet Membrane Glycoprotein IIb/biosynthesis', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Retroviridae/genetics', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid', 'Stem Cells/cytology', 'Tetraspanin 29', 'Zinc Fingers']",2005/09/17 09:00,2005/12/13 09:00,['2005/09/17 09:00'],"['2005/09/17 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/12/13 09:00 [medline]', '2005/09/17 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 2005 Oct;25(19):8592-606. doi: 10.1128/MCB.25.19.8592-8606.2005.,['MC_U137973816/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom'],"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (CD9 protein, human)', '0 (Cd9 protein, mouse)', '0 (GATA1 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Gata1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Platelet Membrane Glycoprotein IIb)', '0 (Tetraspanin 29)', '147336-22-9 (Green Fluorescent Proteins)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",,"['25/19/8592 [pii]', '10.1128/MCB.25.19.8592-8606.2005 [doi]']",,,,,PMC1265752,,,,,,,,,,,

Three conserved repeats (R1, R2, and R3) in the enhancer have been described as Pbx-Hoxb1 (PH) binding sites, and one Pbx-Meinox (PM) binding site has also been characterized. We have investigated the importance and relative roles of PH and PM binding sites with respect to protein interactions and in vivo regulatory activity. We have identified a new PM site (PM2) and found that it cooperates with the R3 PH site to form ternary Prep1-Pbx1-Hoxb1 complexes. In vivo, the combination of the R3 and PM2 sites is sufficient to mediate transgenic reporter activity in the developing chick hindbrain. In both chicken and mouse transgenic embryos, mutations of the PM1 and PM2 sites reveal that they cooperate to modulate in vivo regulatory activity of the Hoxb1 enhancer. Furthermore, we have shown that the R2 motif functions as a strong PM site, with a high binding affinity for Prep1-Pbx1 dimers, and renamed this site R2/PM3. In vitro R2/PM3, when combined with the PM1 and R3 motifs, inhibits ternary complex formation mediated by these elements and in vivo reduces and restricts reporter expression in transgenic embryos. These inhibitory effects appear to be a consequence of the high PM binding activity of the R2/PM3 site. Taken together, our results demonstrate that the activity of the Hoxb1 autoregulatory enhancer depends upon multiple Prep1-Pbx1 (PM1, PM2, and PM3) and Pbx1-Hoxb1 (R1 and R3) binding sites that cooperate to modulate and spatially restrict the expression of Hoxb1 in r4 rhombomere.","['Ferretti, Elisabetta', 'Cambronero, Francisco', 'Tumpel, Stefan', 'Longobardi, Elena', 'Wiedemann, Leanne M', 'Blasi, Francesco', 'Krumlauf, Robb']","['Ferretti E', 'Cambronero F', 'Tumpel S', 'Longobardi E', 'Wiedemann LM', 'Blasi F', 'Krumlauf R']","['Molecular Genetics Unit, Department of Molecular Biology and Functional Genomics, Istituto Scientifico H.

Recently, members of the cyclolignan family have been shown to selectively inhibit the receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) activity of the IGF-1R beta-chain. The effects of the cyclolignan picropodophyllin (PPP) were studied in vitro using a panel of 13 MM cell lines and freshly purified tumor cells from 10 patients with MM. PPP clearly inhibited growth in all MM cell lines and primary MM samples cultured in the presence or absence of bone marrow stromal cells. PPP induced a profound accumulation of cells in the G(2)/M-phase and an increased apoptosis. Importantly, IGF-1, IGF-2, insulin, or IL-6 did not reduce the inhibitory effects of PPP. As demonstrated by in vitro kinase assays, PPP down-regulated the IGF-1 RTK activity without inhibiting the insulin RTK activity. This conferred decreased phosphorylation of Erk1/2 and reduced cyclin dependent kinase (CDK1) activity. In addition, the expression of mcl-1 and survivin was reduced. Taken together, we suggest that interfering with the IGF-1 RTK by using the cyclolignan PPP offers a novel and selective therapeutic strategy for MM.","['Stromberg, Thomas', 'Ekman, Simon', 'Girnita, Leonard', 'Dimberg, Lina Y', 'Larsson, Olle', 'Axelson, Magnus', 'Lennartsson, Johan', 'Hellman, Ulf', 'Carlson, Kristina', 'Osterborg, Anders', 'Vanderkerken, Karin', 'Nilsson, Kenneth', 'Jernberg-Wiklund, Helena']","['Stromberg T', 'Ekman S', 'Girnita L', 'Dimberg LY', 'Larsson O', 'Axelson M', 'Lennartsson J', 'Hellman U', 'Carlson K', 'Osterborg A', 'Vanderkerken K', 'Nilsson K', 'Jernberg-Wiklund H']","['Department of Genetics and Pathology, Rudbeck Laboratory, Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'CDC2 Protein Kinase/metabolism', 'Cell Division/*drug effects', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Enzyme Activation', 'G2 Phase/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins', 'Insulin/pharmacology', 'Insulin-Like Growth Factor I/pharmacology', 'Interleukin-6/pharmacology', 'Microtubule-Associated Proteins/metabolism', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Multiple Myeloma/blood supply/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Neoplasm Proteins/metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Podophyllotoxin/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'Receptor, IGF Type 1/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Receptor, Insulin/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Survivin', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2005/09/17 09:00,2006/02/08 09:00,['2005/09/17 09:00'],"['2005/09/17 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/02/08 09:00 [medline]', '2005/09/17 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 2006 Jan 15;107(2):669-78. doi: 10.1182/blood-2005-01-0306.

We here investigate the in vivo effects of intermittent hypoxia on syngenic grafts of leukemic blasts in a PML-RARalpha transgenic mouse model of AML. For intermittent hypoxia, leukemic mice were housed in a hypoxia chamber equivalent to an altitude of 6000 m for 18 hours every consecutive day. The results show that intermittent hypoxia significantly prolongs the survival of the leukemic mice that received transplants, although it fails to cure the disease. By histologic and cytologic analyses, intermittent hypoxia is shown to inhibit the infiltration of leukemic blasts in peripheral blood, bone marrow, spleen, and liver without apoptosis induction. More intriguingly, intermittent hypoxia also induces leukemic cells to undergo differentiation with progressive increase of hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha protein, as evidenced by morphologic criteria of maturating myeloid cells and increased expression of mouse myeloid cell differentiation-related antigens Gr-1 and Mac-1. Taken together, this study represents the first attempt to characterize the in vivo effects of hypoxia on an AML mouse model.

Conventional chemotherapy has little efficacy. Bortezomib is a novel, reversible, and highly specific proteasome inhibitor that appears as a new hope for MCL treatment. We have analyzed the in vitro sensitivity to bortezomib in 4 MCL cell lines and in primary tumor cells from 10 MCL patients. Bortezomib induced phosphatidylserine exposure, mitochondrial depolarization, ROS generation, Bax and Bak conformational changes, and caspase activation. In addition, ROS scavengers, but not pancaspase inhibitors, blocked all apoptosis hallmarks. Protein and mRNA-expression analysis, revealed marked up-regulation of the BH3-only protein Noxa, between 4 to 6 hours after bortezomib addition, independent of p53 status. However, this up-regulation was faster and higher in cells with functional p53. Noxa RNA interference markedly decreased sensitivity to bortezomib, pointing to this protein as a key mediator between proteasome inhibition and mitochondrial depolarization in MCL cells. Noxa interacts with the antiapoptotic protein Mcl-1 and promotes Bak release from Mcl-1, suggesting that up-regulation of Noxa might counteract Mcl-1 accumulation after bortezomib treatment. These findings should be useful to extend the therapeutic strategies in MCL patients and to improve their prognosis.","['Perez-Galan, Patricia', 'Roue, Gael', 'Villamor, Neus', 'Montserrat, Emili', 'Campo, Elias', 'Colomer, Dolors']","['Perez-Galan P', 'Roue G', 'Villamor N', 'Montserrat E', 'Campo E', 'Colomer D']","[""Hematopathology Unit, Hospital Clinic, Institut d'Investigacions Biomediques August Pi i Sunyer, University of Barcelona, Spain.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Boronic Acids/pharmacology', 'Bortezomib', 'Free Radical Scavengers/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma, Mantle-Cell/drug therapy/metabolism/*pathology', 'Membrane Potentials/drug effects', 'Mitochondria/physiology', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Neoplasm Proteins/metabolism', 'Protease Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Proteasome Inhibitors', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/genetics/*metabolism', 'Pyrazines/pharmacology', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/*metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53', 'Up-Regulation', 'bcl-2 Homologous Antagonist-Killer Protein/metabolism']",2005/09/17 09:00,2006/01/24 09:00,['2005/09/17 09:00'],"['2005/09/17 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/01/24 09:00 [medline]', '2005/09/17 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 2006 Jan 1;107(1):257-64. doi: 10.1182/blood-2005-05-2091.

Cotreatment of Jurkat cells with marginally toxic concentrations of adaphostin and proteasome inhibitors synergistically potentiated mitochondrial damage (eg, cytochrome c release), caspase activation, and apoptosis. Similar interactions occurred in other human leukemia cell types (eg, U937, HL-60, Raji). These interactions were associated with a marked increase in oxidative damage (eg, ROS generation), down-regulation of the Raf/MEK/ERK pathway, and JNK activation. Adaphostin/MG-132 lethality as well as mitochondrial damage, down-regulation of Raf/MEK/ERK, and activation of JNK were attenuated by the free-radical scavenger NAC, suggesting that oxidative damage plays a functional role in antileukemic effects. Ectopic expression of Raf-1 or constitutively active MEK/ERK or genetic interruption of the JNK pathway significantly diminished adaphostin/MG-132-mediated lethality. Interestingly, enforced Raf or MEK/ERK activation partially diminished adaphostin/MG-132-mediated ROS generation, suggesting the existence of an amplification loop. Finally, the adaphostin/MG-132 regimen displayed similar toxicity toward 5 primary AML samples but not normal hematopoietic progenitors (eg, bone marrow CD34+ cells). Collectively, these findings suggest that potentiating oxidative damage by combining adaphostin with proteasome inhibitors warrants attention as an antileukemic strategy.","['Dasmahapatra, Girija', 'Rahmani, Mohamed', 'Dent, Paul', 'Grant, Steven']","['Dasmahapatra G', 'Rahmani M', 'Dent P', 'Grant S']","['Department of Medicine, Virginia Commonwealth University, Richmond, VA, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", 'Retracted Publication']",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Adamantane/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Drug Synergism', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Hydroquinones/pharmacology', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Leukemia/*pathology', 'Oxidative Stress', '*Proteasome Inhibitors', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tyrphostins/*pharmacology']",2005/09/17 09:00,2006/01/24 09:00,['2005/09/17 09:00'],"['2005/09/17 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/01/24 09:00 [medline]', '2005/09/17 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 2006 Jan 1;107(1):232-40. doi: 10.1182/blood-2005-06-2302.

EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Primary lymphocytes from CLL patients were incubated with 10 micromol/L 8-NH(2)-adenosine for 2, 4, and 6 or 8 hours. The accumulation of analogue triphosphate and the decline in endogenous ATP pool were analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography. Inhibition of global RNA and protein synthesis was measured and correlated with specific decline in transcript and protein levels of MCL-1, XIAP, and BCL-2, the key survival factors of CLL. These biochemical and molecular end points were related to cell death of these quiescent lymphocytes. RESULTS: In vitro incubations of CLL lymphocytes with 8-NH(2)-adenosine resulted in rapid but heterogeneous accumulation of 8-NH(2)-ATP (390-680 micromol/L), with a concomitant decline in endogenous ATP (median, >50% by 4 hour). Global RNA synthesis was decreased in all samples and was associated with a decline in MCL-1, XIAP, and BCL-2 transcripts. There was a parallel decrease in the protein level of MCL-1 and XIAP but not BCL-2. These biochemical changes were accompanied by apoptosis. CONCLUSION: The evidence of CLL cell death with complementary changes in the expression of survival proteins provides a molecular rationale for using 8-NH(2)-adenosine as a therapeutic agent for this indolent leukemia.","['Balakrishnan, Kumudha', 'Wierda, William G', 'Keating, Michael J', 'Gandhi, Varsha']","['Balakrishnan K', 'Wierda WG', 'Keating MJ', 'Gandhi V']","['Department of Experimental Therapeutics, The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,IM,"['Adenosine/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Adenosine Triphosphate/analogs & derivatives/metabolism', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects/genetics', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Humans', 'Immunoblotting', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*blood', 'Lymphocytes/*drug effects/metabolism/pathology', 'Middle Aged', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/genetics/metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Time Factors', 'X-Linked Inhibitor of Apoptosis Protein']",2005/09/17 09:00,2005/11/09 09:00,['2005/09/17 09:00'],"['2005/09/17 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/11/09 09:00 [medline]', '2005/09/17 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2005 Sep 15;11(18):6745-52. doi: 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-05-0553.,"['CA100632/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA81534/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA85915/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (X-Linked Inhibitor of Apoptosis Protein)', '0 (XIAP protein, human)', '3868-33-5 (8-aminoadenosine)', '8L70Q75FXE (Adenosine Triphosphate)', 'K72T3FS567 (Adenosine)']",,"['11/18/6745 [pii]', '10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-05-0553 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Patients received topotecan and carboplatin by 5-day continuous infusion at nine dose levels. Patients achieving a complete remission received up to two additional courses for consolidation. Plasma topotecan and ultrafilterable platinum were assayed on days 1 to 5. In addition, pretreatment levels of various polypeptides in leukemic cells were examined by immunoblotting to assess possible correlations with response. RESULTS: Fifty-one patients received a total of 69 courses of therapy. Dose-limiting toxicity consisted of grade 4/5 typhlitis and grade 3/4 mucositis after one course of therapy or grade 4 neutropenia and thrombocytopenia lasting >50 days when a second course was administered on day 21. Among 45 evaluable patients, there were 7 complete remissions, 2 partial remissions, 1 incomplete complete remission, and 1 reversion to chronic-phase chronic myelogenous leukemia. Topotecan steady-state plasma concentrations increased with dose. No accumulation of topotecan or ultrafilterable platinum occurred between days 1 and 5 of therapy. Leukemic cell levels of topoisomerase I, checkpoint kinase 1, checkpoint kinase 2, and Mcl-1 correlated with proliferating cell nuclear antigen but not with response. In contrast, low Bcl-2 expression correlated with response (P = 0.014, Mann-Whitney U test). CONCLUSIONS: The maximum tolerated dose was 1.6 mg/m(2)/d topotecan plus 150 mg/m(2)/d carboplatin. The complete remission rate in a heavily pretreated population was 16% (33% at the highest three dose levels).

A phase 1 study was conducted to determine the maximum tolerated dose and toxicities of ABT-751 in patients with advanced myelodysplastic syndrome and relapsed or refractory acute leukemias. STUDY DESIGN: Thirty-two patients were treated: nine with 100 (n = 3), 125 (n = 3), or 150 mg/m(2) (n = 3) of ABT-751 given orally once daily for 7 days every 3 weeks and 23 with 75 (n = 3), 100 (n = 3), 125 (n = 5), 150 (n = 5), 175 (n = 3), or 200 mg/m(2) (n = 4) of ABT-751 given orally once daily for 21 days every 4 weeks. Consenting patients had pharmacogenetic sampling and enumeration of circulating endothelial cells (CEC). RESULTS: Dose-limiting toxicity consisted of ileus in one patient at 200 mg/m(2), with a subsequent patient developing grade 2 constipation at the same dose level. One patient with relapsed acute myelogenous leukemia achieved a complete remission that was sustained for 2 months. Four other patients had transient hematologic improvements, consisting of a decrease in peripheral blood blasts and improvements in platelet counts. CEC number was reduced in three patients with a concomitant reduction in peripheral blasts. A previously undescribed nonsynonymous single nucleotide polymorphism, encoding Ala(185)Thr, was identified in exon 4 of the beta-tubulin gene, TUBB, in three other patients. The recommended phase 2 dose in hematologic malignancies is 175 mg/m(2) daily orally for 21 days every 4 weeks. CONCLUSION: Further assessment of ABT-751, especially in combination with other agents, in patients with acute leukemias is warranted.","['Yee, Karen W L', 'Hagey, Anne', 'Verstovsek, Srdan', 'Cortes, Jorge', 'Garcia-Manero, Guillermo', ""O'Brien, Susan M"", 'Faderl, Stefan', 'Thomas, Deborah', 'Wierda, William', 'Kornblau, Steven', 'Ferrajoli, Alessandra', 'Albitar, Maher', 'McKeegan, Evelyn', 'Grimm, David R', 'Mueller, Toby', 'Holley-Shanks, Rhonda R', 'Sahelijo, Leonardo', 'Gordon, Gary B', 'Kantarjian, Hagop M', 'Giles, Francis J']","['Yee KW', 'Hagey A', 'Verstovsek S', 'Cortes J', 'Garcia-Manero G', ""O'Brien SM"", 'Faderl S', 'Thomas D', 'Wierda W', 'Kornblau S', 'Ferrajoli A', 'Albitar M', 'McKeegan E', 'Grimm DR', 'Mueller T', 'Holley-Shanks RR', 'Sahelijo L', 'Gordon GB', 'Kantarjian HM', 'Giles FJ']","['Department of Leukemia, University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030, USA.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Clinical Trial, Phase I', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,IM,"['AC133 Antigen', 'Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antigens, CD/analysis', 'Antineoplastic Agents/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'CD146 Antigen', 'Constipation/chemically induced', 'Diarrhea/chemically induced', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Endothelial Cells/chemistry', 'Female', 'Glycoproteins/analysis', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/blood/*drug therapy/genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/blood/drug therapy/genetics', 'Leukocyte Common Antigens/analysis', 'Male', 'Microtubules/metabolism', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/blood/drug therapy/genetics', 'Nausea/chemically induced', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local', 'Neoplastic Cells, Circulating/chemistry', 'Neural Cell Adhesion Molecules/analysis', 'Peptides/analysis', 'Platelet Endothelial Cell Adhesion Molecule-1/analysis', 'Sulfonamides/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Tubulin/genetics', 'Vomiting/chemically induced']",2005/09/17 09:00,2005/11/09 09:00,['2005/09/17 09:00'],"['2005/09/17 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/11/09 09:00 [medline]', '2005/09/17 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2005 Sep 15;11(18):6615-24. doi: 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-05-0650.,,"['0 (ABT751)', '0 (AC133 Antigen)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (CD146 Antigen)', '0 (Glycoproteins)', '0 (Neural Cell Adhesion Molecules)', '0 (Peptides)', '0 (Platelet Endothelial Cell Adhesion Molecule-1)', '0 (Sulfonamides)', '0 (Tubulin)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Leukocyte Common Antigens)']",,"['11/18/6615 [pii]', '10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-05-0650 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In these patients, serum tryptase levels are elevated at diagnosis and decrease to normal (<15 ng/mL) or near normal values in those achieving complete hematologic remission (CR) after chemotherapy. PATIENTS: In this study, we examined the value of tryptase as a marker of minimal residual AML. In 61 patients with de novo AML exhibiting elevated serum tryptase (>15 ng/mL) at diagnosis, tryptase levels were measured serially during and after chemotherapy by a fluoroenzyme immunoassay. RESULTS: Of the 61 patients, 42 (68.9%) entered hematologic CR in response to induction chemotherapy. Twenty-nine of these 42 patients also entered biochemical remission (BR) defined by a decrease of tryptase levels to normal (<15 ng/mL). The remaining 13 patients exhibited elevated enzyme levels despite of hematologic CR. As assessed by multivariate analysis, the elevated tryptase in CR was found to be an independent prognostic variable concerning disease-free survival. Thus, AML relapses occurred in 15 of 29 patients with CR + BR (52%) and in 12 of 13 patients with CR without BR (92%), resulting in a significantly reduced probability of continuous CR for patients with CR without BR (P < 0.05). In all patients with continuous hematologic CR, tryptase levels remained constantly normal, whereas a recurrent elevation of tryptase in CR was invariably followed by a hematologic relapse. CONCLUSION: A persistently elevated tryptase level in AML in CR is indicative of minimal residual AML and associated with a high risk of relapse.","['Sperr, Wolfgang R', 'Mitterbauer, Margit', 'Mitterbauer, Gerlinde', 'Kundi, Michael', 'Jager, Ulrich', 'Lechner, Klaus', 'Valent, Peter']","['Sperr WR', 'Mitterbauer M', 'Mitterbauer G', 'Kundi M', 'Jager U', 'Lechner K', 'Valent P']","['Department of Internal Medicine I, Division of Hematology and Hemostaseology, Medical University of Vienna, Austria. wolfgang.r.sperr@meduniwien.ac.at']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/drug therapy/enzymology/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local', 'Neoplasm, Residual/enzymology/genetics/*pathology', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/genetics', 'Prognosis', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Risk Factors', 'Serine Endopeptidases/*blood', 'Survival Analysis', 'Time Factors', 'Tryptases']",2005/09/17 09:00,2005/11/09 09:00,['2005/09/17 09:00'],"['2005/09/17 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/11/09 09:00 [medline]', '2005/09/17 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2005 Sep 15;11(18):6536-43. doi: 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-05-0732.,,"['0 (CBFbeta-MYH11 fusion protein)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (promyelocytic leukemia-retinoic acid receptor alpha fusion oncoprotein)', 'EC 3.4.21.- (Serine Endopeptidases)', 'EC 3.4.21.59 (Tryptases)']",,"['11/18/6536 [pii]', '10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-05-0732 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Survival of these cells after chemotherapy may lead to minimal residual disease (MRD) and subsequently to relapse. Therefore, the prognostic impact of stem cell frequency in CD34-positive AML was investigated. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: First, the leukemogenic potential of unpurified CD34(+)CD38(-) cells, present among other cells, was investigated in vivo using nonobese diabetic/severe combined immunodeficient mice transplantation experiments. Second, we analyzed whether the CD34(+)CD38(-) compartment at diagnosis correlates with MRD frequency after chemotherapy and clinical outcome in 92 AML patients. RESULTS: In vivo data showed that engraftment of AML blasts in nonobese diabetic/severe combined immunodeficient mice directly correlated with stem cell frequency of the graft. In patients, a high percentage of CD34(+)CD38(-) stem cells at diagnosis significantly correlated with a high MRD frequency, especially after the third course of chemotherapy. Also, it directly correlated with poor survival. In contrast, total CD34(+) percentage showed no such correlations. CONCLUSIONS: Both in vivo data, as well as the correlation studies, show that AML stem cell frequency at diagnosis offers a new prognostic factor. From our data, it is tempting to hypothesize that a large CD34(+)CD38(-) population at diagnosis reflects a higher percentage of chemotherapy-resistant cells that will lead to the outgrowth of MRD, thereby affecting clinical outcome. Ultimately, future therapies should be directed toward malignant stem cells.","['van Rhenen, Anna', 'Feller, Nicole', 'Kelder, Angele', 'Westra, August H', 'Rombouts, Elwin', 'Zweegman, Sonja', 'van der Pol, Marjolein A', 'Waisfisz, Quinten', 'Ossenkoppele, Gert J', 'Schuurhuis, Gerrit Jan']","['van Rhenen A', 'Feller N', 'Kelder A', 'Westra AH', 'Rombouts E', 'Zweegman S', 'van der Pol MA', 'Waisfisz Q', 'Ossenkoppele GJ', 'Schuurhuis GJ']","['Department of Hematology, VU University Medical Center, Amsterdam, the Netherlands.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,IM,"['ADP-ribosyl Cyclase/analysis', 'ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1', 'Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antigens, CD/analysis', 'Antigens, CD34/analysis', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/classification/metabolism/*pathology', 'Male', 'Membrane Glycoproteins', 'Middle Aged', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Neoplasm, Residual/metabolism/*pathology', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*chemistry', 'Prognosis', 'Survival Analysis']",2005/09/17 09:00,2005/11/09 09:00,['2005/09/17 09:00'],"['2005/09/17 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/11/09 09:00 [medline]', '2005/09/17 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2005 Sep 15;11(18):6520-7. doi: 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-05-0468.,,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', 'EC 3.2.2.5 (ADP-ribosyl Cyclase)', 'EC 3.2.2.5 (CD38 protein, human)', 'EC 3.2.2.6 (ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1)']",,"['11/18/6520 [pii]', '10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-05-0468 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Cytogenetic analysis of an adult de novo acute myelogenous leukemia (M5a) revealed a t(3;11)(p24;p15), suggesting rearrangement of NUP98 with a novel partner gene. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) was used to confirm the involvement of NUP98 in the t(3;11)(p24;p15). Selection of possible NUP98 partner genes was done by computer-aided analysis of the 3p24 region using the University of California Santa Cruz genome browser. Fusion gene-specific FISH and reverse transcription-PCR analyses were done to verify the presence of the new NUP98 fusion. RESULTS: FISH analysis using a NUP98-specific clone showed a split signal, indicating that the NUP98 gene was affected by the translocation. Of the genes localized at 3p24, TOP2B was selected as a possible fusion partner candidate gene. Dual-color fusion gene-specific FISH and reverse transcription-PCR analysis verified that NUP98 was indeed fused to TOP2B. In addition to reciprocal NUP98-TOP2B and TOP2B-NUP98 in-frame fusion transcripts, an alternatively spliced out-of-frame TOP2B-NUP98 transcript that resulted in a premature stop codon was detected. Analysis of the genomic breakpoints revealed typical signs of nonhomologous end joining resulting from error-prone DNA repair. CONCLUSIONS: TOP2B encodes a type II topoisomerase, which is involved in DNA transcription, replication, recombination, and mitosis, and besides TOP1, represents the second NUP98 fusion partner gene that belongs to the topoisomerase gene family. This finding emphasizes the important role of topoisomerases in malignant transformation processes.","['Nebral, Karin', 'Schmidt, Helmut H', 'Haas, Oskar A', 'Strehl, Sabine']","['Nebral K', 'Schmidt HH', 'Haas OA', 'Strehl S']","[""Children's Cancer Research Institute, Vienna, Austria.""]",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Base Sequence', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 11/genetics', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 3/genetics', 'DNA Topoisomerases, Type II/*genetics', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Nuclear Pore Complex Proteins/*genetics', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*genetics', 'Poly-ADP-Ribose Binding Proteins', 'RNA, Neoplasm/genetics/metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Sequence Homology, Nucleic Acid', '*Translocation, Genetic']",2005/09/17 09:00,2005/11/09 09:00,['2005/09/17 09:00'],"['2005/09/17 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/11/09 09:00 [medline]', '2005/09/17 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2005 Sep 15;11(18):6489-94. doi: 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-05-0150.,,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Pore Complex Proteins)', '0 (Nup98 protein, human)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Poly-ADP-Ribose Binding Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', 'EC 5.99.1.3 (DNA Topoisomerases, Type II)', 'EC 5.99.1.3 (TOP2B protein, human)']",,"['11/18/6489 [pii]', '10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-05-0150 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The IAP family member IAP-like protein-2 was also up-regulated by Bcr-abl. Disruption of Bcr-abl in Bcr-abl-transduced BaF3 cells by small interfering RNA resulted in 3- to 4-fold reduction in survivin protein confirming the link between Bcr-abl and survivin. Survivin disruption in Bcr-abl-transduced Mo7e cells, or in K562 cells that endogenously express Bcr-abl, by transfection with dominant-negative or antisense survivin constructs promoted apoptosis induced by the Bcr-abl tyrosine kinase inhibitor STI571, which was accompanied by caspase-dependent cleavage of Bcr-abl, mitochondrial membrane potential disruption, and enhanced mitochondrial cytochrome c release. Although ectopic survivin protected K562 cells from apoptosis induced by STI571, it did not protect cells from apoptosis induced either by tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) or the combination of TRAIL plus Hemin. Our results identify a new signal pathway downstream of Bcr-abl, in addition to the Bcl-2 family involved in the antiapoptotic effects of Bcr-abl, and suggest that anti-survivin therapy may have utility in patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia.","['Wang, Zhanxiang', 'Sampath, Janardhan', 'Fukuda, Seiji', 'Pelus, Louis M']","['Wang Z', 'Sampath J', 'Fukuda S', 'Pelus LM']","['Department of Microbiology and Immunology and the Walther Oncology Center, Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, Indiana 46202, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects/genetics', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/pharmacology', 'Benzamides', 'Caspase 9', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cytochromes c/metabolism', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/biosynthesis/genetics/*physiology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology/drug effects/physiology', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Megakaryoblastic, Acute/drug therapy/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Microtubule-Associated Proteins/*antagonists & inhibitors/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*antagonists & inhibitors/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Oligonucleotides, Antisense/genetics', 'Piperazines/*pharmacology', 'Pyrimidines/*pharmacology', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Signal Transduction', 'Survivin', 'TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand', 'Transduction, Genetic', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/pharmacology', 'Up-Regulation']",2005/09/17 09:00,2005/12/13 09:00,['2005/09/17 09:00'],"['2005/09/17 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/12/13 09:00 [medline]', '2005/09/17 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 2005 Sep 15;65(18):8224-32. doi: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-05-0303.,"['HL079654/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL69669/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']","['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (BIRC5 protein, human)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Microtubule-Associated Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Oligonucleotides, Antisense)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Survivin)', '0 (TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand)', '0 (TNFSF10 protein, human)', '0 (Tnfsf10 protein, mouse)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', '9007-43-6 (Cytochromes c)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP9 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Casp9 protein, mouse)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 9)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",,"['65/18/8224 [pii]', '10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-05-0303 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To demonstrate the growth inhibition induced in neuroblastoma cells (the SH-SY5Y and SK-N-AS cell line) and acute promyelocytic leukemia cells (HL-60) by arsenic trioxide (As2O3), the viable cell numbers were counted after trypan blue staining. Apoptosis was assessed by the cell morphology, by flow cytometry with annexin-V staining, and by Western blot analysis for the apoptosis-related proteins (bcl-2 and PARP). To decide the dose for the clinical application of As2O3, normal peripheral blood lymphocytes were also examined. The growth and survival of the SH-SY5Y and SK-N-AS cells were markedly inhibited by As2O3 treatment at a 3 microM concentration before the changes of the normal lymphocytes were observed. The apoptotic cells showed a shrunken cell nucleus, and an increase in the number and balloon-like swelling of the mitochondria at 72 h after the As2O3 was added. Apoptosis of the annexin-V-positive cell proportion in the neuroblastoma cell lines was increased with increasing the exposure time and the concentration of As2O3, just like the HL-60 cells. Bcl-2 downregulation and PARP degradation were also noted all the cell lines, but these changes were not statistically significant among the 3 cell lines.

Human K562, DAUDI or Raji leukemia cells were co-cultured with NK or LAK effector cells at 37 degrees C for 4 h. Target cell killing was evaluated by 51Cr-release assay (CRA) or reduction of telomerase activity (R-TRAPCTX) of the target after exposure to effector cells. NK and LAK effector cells tested against K562 target cells at effector/target ratio of 50:1 showed cytotoxicity of 65% and 78%, respectively, with CRA and 51% and 74%, respectively, with R-TRAPCTX. Incorrect results were obtained with CRA when target cells were admixed with normal fibroblasts, whereas R-TRAPCTX was not influenced by the presence of normal cells. Control experiments performed with telomerase-negative cells showed that telomerase activity of effector cells was not altered during the cytolytic reaction. Moreover, supernatants obtained from effector-target cell co-cultures did not influence telomerase activity of targets. This novel R-TRAPCTX method to assay anti-tumor natural and possibly antigen-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity appears to provide sensible advantages over classical CRA or gamma-interferon release by effector cells in presence of target cells (ELISPOT), since (a) it furnishes reliable data on effector cell killing against neoplastic cells, even when malignant cells are admixed with normal cells, as frequently occurs in tumor biopsies, not manageable with CRA; (b) it provides an actual measure of target cell killing, not furnished by ELISPOT technique.","['Faraoni, Isabella', 'Cottarelli, Andrea', 'Giuliani, Anna', 'Bonmassar, Laura', 'Rossi, Lorena', 'Bonmassar, Enzo']","['Faraoni I', 'Cottarelli A', 'Giuliani A', 'Bonmassar L', 'Rossi L', 'Bonmassar E']","['Department of Neuroscience, University of Rome Tor Vergata, Via Montpellier 1, 00133 Rome, Italy. faraoni@med.uniroma2.it']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,J Immunol Methods,Journal of immunological methods,1305440,IM,"['Chromium Radioisotopes/analysis', 'Cytotoxicity Tests, Immunologic/methods', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Killer Cells, Lymphokine-Activated/*immunology', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*immunology', 'Neoplasms/enzymology/*immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/*immunology', 'Telomerase/*immunology/metabolism']",2005/09/17 09:00,2005/12/13 09:00,['2005/09/17 09:00'],"['2005/03/10 00:00 [received]', '2005/07/01 00:00 [revised]', '2005/07/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2005/09/17 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/12/13 09:00 [medline]', '2005/09/17 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Immunol Methods. 2005 Oct 30;305(2):162-72. doi: 10.1016/j.jim.2005.07.015.

Part 1].,323-33,"OBJECTIVE: This paper is a revision from recent studies related to acute leukemia (AL) epidemiology in children. Cancer is the second cause of death in the pediatric population in Mexico between 1 to 15 years old. The AL are the types of cancer with more frequency in children below 15 years old and the cost of taking care of a child with cancer represents to the health institutions around 620 thousand dollars per year per case. In different places of the world the frequency of the AL has been increased and in Mexico City this is similar. Data from Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social, in Mexico City, reports one of the highest worldwide. The environmental risk factors most consistent are the exposure in utero to X-ray, occupational exposure and pesticides. Other risk factors studied, as the exposure to electromagnetic fields, smoking and alcohol consumption in the parents, diet, and others, have had controversial results. These controversies can be explained by methodological mistakes in the studies and also because these studies did not assess the interaction between the susceptibility to AL and the environmental factors, a situation that could lead to the better understanding of the causal mechanisms of the disease. However it is recommended to have an attitude of prudent caution to accept that these factors are a cause of AL, and to have an energetic position in order to decrease the exposure to them and produce more adequate preventive strategies.","['Mejia Arangure, Juan Manuel', 'Ortega Alvarez, Manuel Carlos', 'Fajardo Gutierrez, Arturo']","['Mejia Arangure JM', 'Ortega Alvarez MC', 'Fajardo Gutierrez A']","['Unidad de Investigacion Medica en Epidemiologia Clinica, Hospital de Pediatria, Centro Medico Nacional Siglo XXI, Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social. jmejiaa@cis.gob.mx']",['spa'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",Mexico,Rev Med Inst Mex Seguro Soc,Revista medica del Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social,101243727,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Infant', 'Leukemia/*epidemiology/*etiology', 'Male', 'Mexico/epidemiology', 'Risk Factors']",2005/09/17 09:00,2005/12/13 09:00,['2005/09/17 09:00'],"['2005/09/17 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/12/13 09:00 [medline]', '2005/09/17 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Rev Med Inst Mex Seguro Soc. 2005 Jul-Aug;43(4):323-33.,,,125,,Epidemiologia de las leucemias agudas en ninos.

It is found in active CDK holoenzyme complexes from adult T-cell leukemia-derived cultures and stimulates the G1- to-S phase transition by activating the cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) CDK4. The Tax protein directly and specifically interacts with CDK4 and cyclin D2 and binding is required for enhanced CDK4 kinase activity. The protein-protein contact between Tax and the components of the cyclin D/CDK complexes increases the association of CDK4 and its positive regulatory subunit cyclin D and renders the complex resistant to p21CIP inhibition. Tax mutants affecting the N-terminus cannot bind cyclin D and CDK4. RESULTS: To analyze, whether the N-terminus of Tax is capable of CDK4-binding, in vitro binding -, pull down -, and mammalian two-hybrid analyses were performed. These experiments revealed that a segment of 40 amino acids is sufficient to interact with CDK4 and cyclin D2. To define a Tax-binding domain and analyze how Tax influences the kinase activity, a series of CDK4 deletion mutants was tested. Different assays revealed two regions which upon deletion consistently result in reduced binding activity. These were isolated and subjected to mammalian two-hybrid analysis to test their potential to interact with the Tax N-terminus. These experiments concurrently revealed binding at the N- and C-terminus of CDK4. The N-terminal segment contains the PSTAIRE helix, which is known to control the access of substrate to the active cleft of CDK4 and thus the kinase activity. CONCLUSION: Since the N- and C-terminus of CDK4 are neighboring in the predicted three-dimensional protein structure, it is conceivable that they comprise a single binding domain, which interacts with the Tax N-terminus.","['Fraedrich, Kirsten', 'Muller, Birthe', 'Grassmann, Ralph']","['Fraedrich K', 'Muller B', 'Grassmann R']","['Institut fur Klinische und Molekulare Virologie, Universitat Erlangen-Nurnberg, Schlossgarten 4, D-91054 Erlangen, Germany. kirsten.fraedrich@viro.med.uni-erlangen.de']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Retrovirology,Retrovirology,101216893,IM,"['Binding Sites', 'Cyclin D2', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 4/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Cyclins/metabolism', 'Gene Products, tax/*chemistry/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Protein Structure, Secondary', 'Two-Hybrid System Techniques']",2005/09/17 09:00,2006/07/27 09:00,['2005/09/17 09:00'],"['2005/07/12 00:00 [received]', '2005/09/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2005/09/17 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/07/27 09:00 [medline]', '2005/09/17 09:00 [entrez]']",epublish,Retrovirology. 2005 Sep 15;2:54. doi: 10.1186/1742-4690-2-54.,,"['0 (CCND2 protein, human)', '0 (Cyclin D2)', '0 (Cyclins)', '0 (Gene Products, tax)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (CDK4 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 4)']",,"['1742-4690-2-54 [pii]', '10.1186/1742-4690-2-54 [doi]']",,,,20050915,PMC1253534,,,,,,,,,,,

Objective To elucidate the biological function of the CysLT1 receptor of human monocytes/macrophages. METHODS: We examined the production of TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP-1), macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF), and eotaxin induced by CysLTs (leukotriene (LT)C4, -D4, and -E4) in THP-1 cells, a human monocytic leukaemia cell line, and peripheral blood CD14+ monocytes/macrophages. Moreover, we examined the effect of CysLTs on the expression of beta-chemokine receptor 2B (CCR2B) as the receptor of MCP-1 by Western blot analysis. RESULTS: ELISA revealed that CysLTs induced MCP-1 in THP-1 cells and peripheral blood CD14+ monocytes/macrophages, but not other cytokines. PCR demonstrated that CysLTs increased MCP-1 mRNA expression in THP-1 cells, and Western blotting showed that CysLTs increased the expression of CCR2B in THP-1 cells. Moreover, we demonstrated that pranlukast, a CysLT1 receptor antagonist, blocked MCP-1 production by CysLTs in THP-1 cells almost completely, and partially inhibited MCP-1 release by CysLTs in peripheral blood CD14+ monocytes/macrophages and CCR2B expression by CysLTs in THP-1 cells. CONCLUSION: CysLTs induce MCP-1 and increase CCR2B expression in human monocytes/macrophages.","['Ichiyama, T', 'Hasegawa, M', 'Ueno, Y', 'Makata, H', 'Matsubara, T', 'Furukawa, S']","['Ichiyama T', 'Hasegawa M', 'Ueno Y', 'Makata H', 'Matsubara T', 'Furukawa S']","['Department of Pediatrics, Yamaguchi University School of Medicine, 1-1-1 Minamikogushi, Ube, Yamaguchi 755-8505, Japan. ichiyama@yamaguchi-u.ac.jp']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Clin Exp Allergy,Clinical and experimental allergy : journal of the British Society for Allergy and Clinical Immunology,8906443,IM,"['Blotting, Western/methods', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Chemokine CCL11', 'Chemokine CCL2/genetics/*metabolism', 'Chemokines, CC/metabolism', 'Chromones/pharmacology', 'Cytokines/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukotriene Antagonists/pharmacology', 'Leukotriene C4/pharmacology', 'Leukotriene D4/pharmacology', 'Leukotriene E4/pharmacology', 'Leukotrienes/*pharmacology', 'Lipopolysaccharide Receptors/immunology', 'Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/biosynthesis/metabolism', 'Macrophages/drug effects/*immunology', 'Monocytes/drug effects/*immunology', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'Receptors, CCR2', 'Receptors, Chemokine/analysis', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Statistics, Nonparametric', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/metabolism']",2005/09/17 09:00,2006/01/18 09:00,['2005/09/17 09:00'],"['2005/09/17 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/01/18 09:00 [medline]', '2005/09/17 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Clin Exp Allergy. 2005 Sep;35(9):1214-9. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2222.2005.02323.x.,,"['0 (CCL11 protein, human)', '0 (CCL2 protein, human)', '0 (CCR2 protein, human)', '0 (Chemokine CCL11)', '0 (Chemokine CCL2)', '0 (Chemokines, CC)', '0 (Chromones)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Leukotriene Antagonists)', '0 (Leukotrienes)', '0 (Lipopolysaccharide Receptors)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, CCR2)', '0 (Receptors, Chemokine)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '2CU6TT9V48 (Leukotriene C4)', '73836-78-9 (Leukotriene D4)', '75715-89-8 (Leukotriene E4)', '81627-83-0 (Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', 'TB8Z891092 (pranlukast)']",,"['CEA2323 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1365-2222.2005.02323.x [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

At the chromatin level H4R3 methylation provides a signal integration step during myeloid differentiation. In order to globally characterize the role of arginine methylation in signal integration and developmental processes we decided to map genomic loci marked by protein arginine methyl transferase 1 (PRMT1) via histone H4 arginine 3 methylation. For this, we used the myeloid leukemia cell line, HL60, which is known to differentiate along the monocyte/macrophage or granulocyte lineage. We used chromatin immunoprecipitation with an antibody specific for the H4 arginine 3 methyl epitope followed by cloning to isolate genomic loci marked by this modification. After sequencing and in silico analysis we found that all of the genomic hits identified were intronic or within 5 kb of 5' ends of specific genes. The locations identified were enriched in conserved transcription factor binding sites of POU2F1, MEF-2 and FOXL1 factors.

Many cases of CLL have a non-aggressive course and often do not require treatment, while other cases exhibit rapid progression within several years. Recent advances in the diagnosis of CLL include the identification of several prognostic factors, such as ZAP70 expression and the absence of immunoglobulin gene rearrangements. These prognostic factors may identify subgroups of CLL patients who would benefit from earlier treatment rather than ""watchful waiting."" New combination treatment regimens that include nucleoside analogs (fludarabine, cladribine, and pentostatin) and monoclonal antibodies (rituximab and alemtuzumab) have resulted in improved rates of complete remissions in newly diagnosed and relapsed CLL patients; many of these are molecular complete remissions. The only known cure for CLL remains allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation. Newer conditioning strategies with lower, nonmyeloablative doses of chemotherapy and radiation therapy have made this option available to a broader group of patients, including older and sicker populations.

Cell lines representing a wide spectrum of malignancies, including prostate, breast and lung, exhibit sensitivity to the cytotoxic effects of methyl jasmonate (MJ). Jasmonates induced death in leukemic cells isolated from the blood of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) patients and increased significantly the survival of lymphoma-bearing mice. Among the naturally occurring jasmonates, MJ is the most active, while the synthetic methyl-4,5-didehydrojasmonate, was approximately 29-fold more active than MJ. The cytotoxic activity of MJ is independent of transcription and translation. Studies have suggested several mechanisms of action. It appears that while prolonged exposures to relatively low concentrations of jasmonates induce growth arrest and re-differentiation in myeloid leukemia cells, higher concentrations of MJ induce direct perturbation of cancer cell mitochondria, leading to the release of cytochrome c and eventual cell death. A most important characteristic of jasmonates is their ability to selectively kill cancer cells while sparing normal cells. Even within a mixed population of normal and leukemic cells derived from the blood of CLL patients, MJ killed preferentially the leukemic cells. In conclusion, jasmonates present a unique class of anti-cancer compounds which deserves continued research at the basic and pharmaceutical levels in order to yield novel chemotherapeutic agents against a range of neoplastic diseases.","['Flescher, Eliezer']",['Flescher E'],"['Department of Human Microbiology, Sackler Faculty of Medicine, Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv, Israel. flascher@post.tau.ac.il']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Anticancer Drugs,Anti-cancer drugs,9100823,IM,"['Acetates/pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cyclopentanes/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Mitochondria/drug effects', 'Molecular Structure', 'Neoplasms/drug therapy', 'Oxylipins', 'Plant Growth Regulators/*pharmacology']",2005/09/16 09:00,2005/12/17 09:00,['2005/09/16 09:00'],"['2005/09/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/12/17 09:00 [medline]', '2005/09/16 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Anticancer Drugs. 2005 Oct;16(9):911-6. doi: 10.1097/01.cad.0000176501.63680.80.,,"['0 (Acetates)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Cyclopentanes)', '0 (Oxylipins)', '0 (Plant Growth Regulators)', '6RI5N05OWW (jasmonic acid)', '900N171A0F (methyl jasmonate)', 'RC4W0G9YUK (jasmone)']",30,"['00001813-200510000-00002 [pii]', '10.1097/01.cad.0000176501.63680.80 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

DESIGN: Retrospective. SETTING: An academic medical center. PATIENTS: Seventy-one deceased adult BMT recipients. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS: Antemortem and postmortem pulmonary findings. RESULTS: The transplants were allogeneic in 39 patients (55%), with a peripheral stem cell source in 43 patients (61%). Death occurred at a median of 1.30 months after transplant. Ninety-six pulmonary complications were noted in 63 patients (89%): 27 infectious (bacterial bronchopneumonia, n = 13; pulmonary aspergillosis, n = 11; cytomegalovirus pneumonia, n = 2; and Candida bronchopneumonia, n = 1) and 69 noninfectious (diffuse alveolar damage, n = 35; diffuse alveolar hemorrhage [DAH], n = 10; amyloidosis, n = 9; pulmonary embolism, n = 5; lymphoma/leukemia, n = 4; bronchiolitis obliterans, n = 2; bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia, n = 1; pulmonary alveolar proteinosis, n = 1; aspiration pneumonia, n = 1; and acute and organizing pneumonia, n = 1). Twenty-seven of the 96 complications (28%) were diagnosed antemortem. Infectious complications were more likely to be diagnosed antemortem compared to noninfectious complications (48% vs 20%, p = 0.006). Six of the 13 patients with bronchopneumonia (46%), 5 of the 11 patients with pulmonary aspergillosis (45%), and 7 of the 8 patients with DAH (88%) at autopsy were not receiving treatment for these conditions at the time of death. Ten patients being treated for suspected pulmonary aspergillosis, 7 patients treated for suspected pulmonary cytomegalovirus infection, 22 patients treated for suspected bacterial pneumonia, 2 patients treated for suspected Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia, and 12 patients treated for DAH at the time of death had no evidence of these conditions at autopsy. The most common immediate cause of death was respiratory failure (n = 37, 52%). CONCLUSIONS: Pulmonary complications, the majority not diagnosed antemortem, are the most common cause of death in BMT recipients. As the result of underdiagnosis, BMT recipients may not receive appropriate therapy for potentially treatable pulmonary complications.","['Sharma, Sunita', 'Nadrous, Hassan F', 'Peters, Steve G', 'Tefferi, Ayalew', 'Litzow, Mark R', 'Aubry, Marie-Christine', 'Afessa, Bekele']","['Sharma S', 'Nadrous HF', 'Peters SG', 'Tefferi A', 'Litzow MR', 'Aubry MC', 'Afessa B']","['Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Mayo Clinic College of Medicine, Rochester, MN 55905, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Chest,Chest,0231335,IM,"['Adult', 'Autopsy', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/*adverse effects', 'Cohort Studies', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Lung/*pathology', 'Lung Diseases/*diagnosis/etiology/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Retrospective Studies']",2005/09/16 09:00,2005/11/09 09:00,['2005/09/16 09:00'],"['2005/09/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/11/09 09:00 [medline]', '2005/09/16 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Chest. 2005 Sep;128(3):1385-92. doi: 10.1378/chest.128.3.1385.,,,,"['S0012-3692(15)52163-6 [pii]', '10.1378/chest.128.3.1385 [doi]']",,,,,,,['Chest. 2006 Feb;129(2):498; author reply 498.

Although p53 mRNA expression level of t(8;21)AML cells was not low, p53 protein expression was reduced in t(8;21)AML cells. Genotoxic damage by ionizing radiation did not induce p53 upregulation in t(8;21)AML cells. Since p14(ARF) has been demonstrated to inhibit p53 degradation by binding to MDM2, repression of p14(ARF) expression in t(8;21)AML may facilitate the degradation of p53 by MDM2. Low p14(ARF) in t(8;21)AML may also account for the absence of upregulation of p53 by ionizing radiation. Then, we have shown that p53 expression level was inversely correlated with S/G2/M population of cell cycle in AML cells. Most of the t(8;21)AML are considered to be in p53(low) S/G2/M(high). It is now widely known that formation of AML1-MTG8 by t(8;21) translocation is a very early event in leukemogenesis, and AML1-MTG8 alone might have limited proliferative potential. Then, secondary oncogenic events such as activated receptor tyrosine kinase (like c-kit mutation), is necessary to become full-blown leukemia. Low p53 protein expression and insufficient induction of p53 by genotoxic damage might increase the opportunity to obtain additional oncogenic events, since genome guard function of p53 does not work in t(8;21)AML cells.","['Shikami, Masato', 'Miwa, Hiroshi', 'Nishii, Kazuhiro', 'Kyo, Taiichi', 'Tanaka, Isao', 'Shiku, Hiroshi', 'Kita, Kenkichi', 'Nitta, Masakazu']","['Shikami M', 'Miwa H', 'Nishii K', 'Kyo T', 'Tanaka I', 'Shiku H', 'Kita K', 'Nitta M']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Division of Hematology, Aichi Medical University, 21 Karimata, Nagakute, Aichi 480-1195, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,IM,"['Cell Cycle', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 21', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 8', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/pathology', 'Radiation, Ionizing', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', '*Translocation, Genetic', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p14ARF/*genetics', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/*genetics']",2005/09/16 09:00,2006/04/28 09:00,['2005/09/16 09:00'],"['2005/06/06 00:00 [received]', '2005/08/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2005/09/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/04/28 09:00 [medline]', '2005/09/16 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 2006 Apr;30(4):379-83. doi: 10.1016/j.leukres.2005.08.007.

In this study, we investigate in detail the specificity and mechanism by which a microtubule de-polymerising agent, nocodazole, induces apoptosis in non-cyclingm, i.e. G(0)/G(1), chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) B-cells. The majority of cases of CLL are sensitive (IC(50)<or=16 microM) but normal peripheral blood B-cells, which are also in G(0)/G(1), are resistant to the maximum in vitro concentration of this agent. Taxol, a microtubule stabilising drug does not kill CLL cells suggesting a specific effect of nocodazole. The mechanism of apoptosis involves mitochondrial membrane depolarisation, activation of caspases and cleavage of PARP. Nocodazole causes two patterns of change to Bcl-2 expression. In one there is increase in expression of the serine-70 phosphorylated form of Bcl-2 and in the other total Bcl-2 expression is reduced. Collectively the data shows that sensitivity to nocodazole-induced apoptosis is a feature of chronic lymphocytic leukaemia and suggests that newer microtubule active agents be systematically investigated for their effectiveness in this condition.","['Beswick, Richard W', 'Ambrose, Helen E', 'Wagner, Simon D']","['Beswick RW', 'Ambrose HE', 'Wagner SD']","['Division of Investigative Sciences, Department of Haematology, Imperial College London, Hammersmith Hospital, Du Cane Road, London W12 0NN, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Caspase Inhibitors', 'Cysteine Proteinase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/metabolism/*pathology', 'Microtubules/*drug effects', 'Nocodazole/*pharmacology', 'Paclitaxel/pharmacology', 'Phosphorylation', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2005/09/16 09:00,2006/04/28 09:00,['2005/09/16 09:00'],"['2005/06/21 00:00 [received]', '2005/08/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2005/09/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/04/28 09:00 [medline]', '2005/09/16 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 2006 Apr;30(4):427-36. doi: 10.1016/j.leukres.2005.08.009.

The gene may participate in the disease development. The aim of the study was to develop appropriate conditions for PCNA-siRNA transfection into K562 and MOLM-7 cell lines (which both have the up-regulated PCNA gene) and to silence the increased expression. METHODS AND RESULTS: Key parameters of successful siRNA delivery into the cells are type and quantity of transfection reagent, cells and siRNA concentration or cultivation time before an expression analysis. Transfection reagents ExGene 500 (Fermentas), Metafectene (Biontex), Oligofectamine (Qiagen) and siPORT Amine (Ambion) were tested. Transfection efficiency was monitored by fluorescence microscopy of fluorescein labeled siRNA. Gene silencing was determined at mRNA level by real-time PCR and at protein level by western blots. As the most suitable reagent was chosen Oligofectamine, which achieved 70% decrease of PCNA mRNA level. Further, 50 nM siRNA concentration, 1 x 10(6) cells/ml and amount of Oligofectamine 4 microl per 1 ml of transfected cells were selected. The best cultivation time after siRNA delivery was 48 h. CONCLUSIONS: Based on the results of this study, transfection method for siRNA delivery into the K562 and MOLM-7 cell lines was proposed. The procedure can be transferred also on further selected genes potentially involved in CML and afterwards it will be possible to monitor the impact of siRNA-inhibition on expression profile. In the future siRNAs against some over-expressed genes would be used for gene therapy of CML.","['Merkerova, M', 'Bruchova, H', 'Brdicka, R']","['Merkerova M', 'Bruchova H', 'Brdicka R']","['Ustav hematologie a krevni transfuze, Praha. michaela.merkerova@uhkt.cz']",['cze'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Czech Republic,Cas Lek Cesk,Casopis lekaru ceskych,0004743,IM,"['Cell Line, Tumor', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', '*Gene Silencing', '*Gene Transfer Techniques', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Proliferating Cell Nuclear Antigen/*genetics', '*RNA, Small Interfering', '*Transfection']",2005/09/16 09:00,2005/11/09 09:00,['2005/09/16 09:00'],"['2005/09/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/11/09 09:00 [medline]', '2005/09/16 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cas Lek Cesk. 2005;144(7):472-5.,,"['0 (Proliferating Cell Nuclear Antigen)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)']",,,Cilene tlumeni exprese genu PCNA pomoci siRNA v leukemickych bunecnych liniich.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Single-voxel localized variants of COSY and DQF-COSY 2D 1H-MRS sequences were developed for use at 1.5 T to investigate the biochemical composition of human bone marrow in vivo. The performance of each sequence was initially tested in vitro using lipid phantoms. An unsaturated lipid proton index was developed to interrogate the degree of unsaturation within the triacylglyceride (TAG) acyl chains. Localized 2D 1H-MRS data were obtained from the bone marrow of healthy controls (N = 6), patients presenting with acute leukemia (N = 6) and patients with acute leukemia in remission (N = 4). RESULTS: The COSY and DQF-COSY data recorded from all subject cohorts were similar, and the unsaturated lipid proton index did not reveal significant differences between patient groups. Variations in water content and measured relaxation times showed minor differences between the measurement groups. CONCLUSIONS: No significant differences were observed in the spectra obtained from bone marrow using the 2D 1H-MRS sequences. A novel unsaturated lipid proton index was developed.","['Prescot, Andrew P', 'Dzik-Jurasz, Andrzej S K', 'Leach, Martin O', 'Sirohi, Bhawna', 'Powles, Ray', 'Collins, David J']","['Prescot AP', 'Dzik-Jurasz AS', 'Leach MO', 'Sirohi B', 'Powles R', 'Collins DJ']","['Cancer Research UK Clinical Magnetic Resonance Research Group, Institute of Cancer Research, Sutton, Surrey, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Magn Reson Imaging,Journal of magnetic resonance imaging : JMRI,9105850,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Bone Marrow/*chemistry', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*metabolism', 'Lipids/*analysis', 'Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy/*methods', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Phantoms, Imaging', 'Tibia/*metabolism']",2005/09/15 09:00,2006/01/20 09:00,['2005/09/15 09:00'],"['2005/09/15 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/01/20 09:00 [medline]', '2005/09/15 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Magn Reson Imaging. 2005 Oct;22(4):541-8. doi: 10.1002/jmri.20413.,,['0 (Lipids)'],,['10.1002/jmri.20413 [doi]'],,"['(c) 2005 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

They are used to organize data according to a theory of the domain. Towards that end, ontologies provide class definitions (i.e., the necessary and sufficient conditions for defining class membership). In medical ontologies, it is often difficult to establish such definitions for diseases. We use three examples (anemia, leukemia and schizophrenia) to illustrate the limitations of ontologies as classification resources. We show that eligibility criteria are often more useful than the Aristotelian definitions traditionally used in ontologies. Examples of eligibility criteria for diseases include complex predicates such as ' x is an instance of the class C when at least n criteria among m are verified' and 'symptoms must last at least one month if not treated, but less than one month, if effectively treated'. References to normality and abnormality are often found in disease definitions, but the operational definition of these references (i.e., the statistical and contextual information necessary to define them) is rarely provided. We conclude that knowledge bases that include probabilistic and statistical knowledge as well as rule-based criteria are more useful than Aristotelian definitions for representing the predicates defined by necessary and sufficient conditions. Rich knowledge bases are needed to clarify the relations between individuals and classes in various studies and applications. However, as ontologies represent relations among classes, they can play a supporting role in disease classification services built primarily on knowledge bases.","['Burgun, Anita', 'Bodenreider, Olivier', 'Jacquelinet, Christian']","['Burgun A', 'Bodenreider O', 'Jacquelinet C']","[""EA 3888, Laboratoire d'Informatique Medicale, Faculte de Medecine, IFR 140, Universite de Rennes I, France. anita.burgunparenthoine@""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Netherlands,Stud Health Technol Inform,Studies in health technology and informatics,9214582,,"['Humans', '*Knowledge', '*Knowledge Bases', 'Schizophrenia', 'Vocabulary, Controlled']",2005/09/15 09:00,2016/04/23 06:00,['2005/09/15 09:00'],"['2005/09/15 09:00 [pubmed]', '2016/04/23 06:00 [medline]', '2005/09/15 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Stud Health Technol Inform. 2005;116:695-700.,['Z99 LM999999/Intramural NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,PMC1784521,,,,,,,,,['NIHMS15120'],,

The Hungarian mortality rates were analysed by autoregressive integrated moving average models and seasonal time series models examined the data of acute childhood lymphoid leukaemia.The mortality data may be analysed by time series methods such as autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) modelling. This method is demonstrated by two examples: analysis of the mortality rates of ischemic heart diseases and analysis of the mortality rates of cancer of digestive system. Mathematical expressions are given for the results of analysis. The relationships between time series of mortality rates were studied with ARIMA models. Calculations of confidence intervals for autoregressive parameters by tree methods: standard normal distribution as estimation and estimation of the White's theory and the continuous time case estimation. Analysing the confidence intervals of the first order autoregressive parameters we may conclude that the confidence intervals were much smaller than other estimations by applying the continuous time estimation model.We present a new approach to analysing the occurrence of acute childhood lymphoid leukaemia. We decompose time series into components. The periodicity of acute childhood lymphoid leukaemia in Hungary was examined using seasonal decomposition time series method. The cyclic trend of the dates of diagnosis revealed that a higher percent of the peaks fell within the winter months than in the other seasons.

These roles of ICP0 require its RING finger E3 ubiquitin ligase domain, which induces the degradation of several cellular proteins, including components of promyelocytic leukemia nuclear bodies and centromeres. ICP0 also interacts very strongly with the cellular ubiquitin-specific protease USP7 (also known as HAUSP). We have shown previously that ICP0 induces its own ubiquitination and degradation in a RING finger-dependent manner, and that its interaction with USP7 regulates this process. In the course of these studies we found and report here that ICP0 also targets USP7 for ubiquitination and proteasome-dependent degradation. The reciprocal activities of the two proteins reveal an intriguing situation that poses the question of the balance of the two processes during productive HSV-1 infection. Based on a thorough analysis of the properties of an HSV-1 mutant virus that expresses forms of ICP0 that are unable to bind to USP7, we conclude that USP7-mediated stabilization of ICP0 is dominant over ICP0-induced degradation of USP7 during productive HSV-1 infection. We propose that the biological significance of the ICP0-USP7 interaction may be most pronounced in natural infection situations, in which limited amounts of ICP0 are expressed.","['Boutell, Chris', 'Canning, Mary', 'Orr, Anne', 'Everett, Roger D']","['Boutell C', 'Canning M', 'Orr A', 'Everett RD']","['MRC Virology Unit, Institute of Virology, Church Street, Glasgow G11 5JR, Scotland, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,IM,"['Animals', 'Baculoviridae/genetics', 'Cell Line', 'Cricetinae', 'Endopeptidases/*metabolism', 'Gene Expression', 'Herpesvirus 1, Human/genetics/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Immediate-Early Proteins/*metabolism', 'Neoplasm Proteins/metabolism', 'Nuclear Proteins/metabolism', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex/metabolism', 'Protein Binding', 'Transcription Factors/metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/metabolism', 'Ubiquitin/metabolism', 'Ubiquitin Thiolesterase', 'Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases', 'Ubiquitin-Specific Peptidase 7']",2005/09/15 09:00,2005/10/22 09:00,['2005/09/15 09:00'],"['2005/09/15 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/10/22 09:00 [medline]', '2005/09/15 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Virol. 2005 Oct;79(19):12342-54. doi: 10.1128/JVI.79.19.12342-12354.2005.,,"['0 (Immediate-Early Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '0 (Ubiquitin)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Vmw110 protein, Human herpesvirus 1)', 'EC 3.4.- (Endopeptidases)', 'EC 3.4.19.12 (USP7 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.19.12 (Ubiquitin Thiolesterase)', 'EC 3.4.19.12 (Ubiquitin-Specific Peptidase 7)', 'EC 3.4.25.1 (Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex)']",,"['79/19/12342 [pii]', '10.1128/JVI.79.19.12342-12354.2005 [doi]']",,,,,PMC1211536,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, we asked whether placental soluble factors (PSF) could limit cell-cell contact inducing HIV-1 production that occurs after inoculation of HIV-1-infected peripheral blood mononuclear cells (HIV-1+ PBMCs) onto trophoblast-derived BeWo cells grown as tight and polarized barriers in a two-chamber system. The activity of recombinant chemokines and cytokines expressed by placental tissue and of factors secreted by either early or term placentae of HIV-1-negative women, was analyzed. We identified chemokines (RANTES and MIP-1beta) and cytokines (tumor necrosis factor alpha and interleukin-8) that decreased and increased, respectively, viral production in trophoblast barrier cells inoculated with HIV-1+ PBMCs. Unexpectedly, factors secreted by either early or term placentae of HIV-1-negative women enhanced viral production. Nevertheless, the same PSF did not favor infection of trophoblastic barriers with cell-free HIV-1 and strongly reduced viral production in PBMCs infected with cell-free HIV-1. Moreover, PSF contained chemokines (RANTES and MIP-1beta) and a cytokine, leukemia inhibitory factor, exhibiting a strong anti-HIV-1 activity in our model of cell-to-cell infection. Together these data suggested that at the maternal interface the global activity of PSF is related to the synergistic action of several soluble factors with a balance in favor of an enhancing activity on the passage of viruses across the trophoblast barrier. This could explain the presence of viral sequences in trophoblasts in all placentae of HIV-1-infected women.","['Derrien, Muriel', 'Faye, Albert', 'Dolcini, Guillermina', 'Chaouat, Gerard', 'Barre-Sinoussi, Francoise', 'Menu, Elisabeth']","['Derrien M', 'Faye A', 'Dolcini G', 'Chaouat G', 'Barre-Sinoussi F', 'Menu E']","['Unite de Regulations des Infections Retrovirales, Departement de Virologie, Institut Pasteur, 25, rue du Dr. Roux 75724 Paris Cedex 15 France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,IM,"['Cell Line, Tumor', 'Chemokine CCL4', 'Chemokine CCL5/immunology', 'Chemokines/*immunology', 'Cytokines/*immunology', 'HIV-1/*pathogenicity/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-8/immunology', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/virology', 'Macrophage Inflammatory Proteins/immunology', 'Trophoblasts/*immunology/*virology', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/immunology']",2005/09/15 09:00,2005/10/22 09:00,['2005/09/15 09:00'],"['2005/09/15 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/10/22 09:00 [medline]', '2005/09/15 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Virol. 2005 Oct;79(19):12304-10. doi: 10.1128/JVI.79.19.12304-12310.2005.,,"['0 (Chemokine CCL4)', '0 (Chemokine CCL5)', '0 (Chemokines)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Interleukin-8)', '0 (Macrophage Inflammatory Proteins)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)']",,"['79/19/12304 [pii]', '10.1128/JVI.79.19.12304-12310.2005 [doi]']",,,,,PMC1211513,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the CT domains involved and the underlying mechanism responsible for this ""inside-out"" regulation of Env function are unknown. HIV and SIV CTs are remarkably long and contain amphipathic alpha-helical domains (LLP1, LLP2, and LLP3) that likely interact with cellular membranes. Using a cell-cell fusion assay and a panel of HIV Envs with stop codons at various positions in the CT, we show that truncations of gp41 proximal to the most N-terminal alpha helix, LLP2, increase fusion efficiency and expose CD4-induced epitopes in the Env ectodomain. These effects were not seen with a truncation distal to this domain and before LLP1. Using a dye transfer assay to quantitate fusion kinetics, we found that these truncations produced a two- to fourfold increase in the rate of fusion. These results were observed for X4-, R5-, and dual-tropic Envs on CXCR4- and CCR5-expressing target cells and could not be explained by differences in Env surface expression. These findings suggest that distal to the membrane-spanning domain, an interaction of the gp41 LLP2 domain with the cell membrane restricts Env fusogenicity during Env processing. As with murine leukemia viruses, where cleavage of a membrane-interactive R peptide at the C terminus is required for Env to become fusogenic, this restriction of Env function may serve to protect virus-producing cells from the membrane-disruptive effects of the Env ectodomain.","['Wyss, Stephanie', 'Dimitrov, Antony S', 'Baribaud, Frederic', 'Edwards, Terri G', 'Blumenthal, Robert', 'Hoxie, James A']","['Wyss S', 'Dimitrov AS', 'Baribaud F', 'Edwards TG', 'Blumenthal R', 'Hoxie JA']","['Department of Medicine, Hematology-Oncology Division, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', '*Cell Fusion', 'Cell Line', 'Codon, Nonsense', 'HIV Envelope Protein gp160/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'HIV Envelope Protein gp41/chemistry/genetics/*physiology', 'HIV-1/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutagenesis, Site-Directed', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Quail']",2005/09/15 09:00,2005/10/22 09:00,['2005/09/15 09:00'],"['2005/09/15 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/10/22 09:00 [medline]', '2005/09/15 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Virol. 2005 Oct;79(19):12231-41. doi: 10.1128/JVI.79.19.12231-12241.2005.,"['P30 AI045008/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AI045378/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 AI45008/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AI45378/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States']","['0 (Codon, Nonsense)', '0 (HIV Envelope Protein gp160)', '0 (HIV Envelope Protein gp41)']",,"['79/19/12231 [pii]', '10.1128/JVI.79.19.12231-12241.2005 [doi]']",,,,,PMC1211532,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, 148 SIV provirus integration sites were sequenced and mapped in the human genome. Our analysis showed that SIV integration, like that of HIV type 1 (HIV-1), exhibited a strong preference for actively transcribed regions in the genome (A. R. Schroder et al., Cell 110:521-529, 2002) and no preference for the CpG islands or transcription start sites, in contrast to observations for murine leukemia virus (X.

HIV-1 Env trimers induce membrane fusion through a pH-independent pathway driven by the interaction between an Env trimer and its cellular receptors, CD4 and CCR5/CXCR4. We studied viruses with mixed heterotrimers of wild-type and dominant-negative Envs to determine the number (T) of Env trimers required for HIV-1 entry. To our surprise, we found that a single Env trimer is capable of supporting HIV-1 entry; i.e., T = 1. A similar approach was applied to investigate the entry stoichiometry of envelope glycoproteins from amphotropic murine leukemia virus (A-MLV), avian sarcoma/leukosis virus type A (ASLV-A), and influenza A virus. When pseudotyped on HIV-1 virions, the A-MLV and ASLV-A Envs also exhibit a T = 1 entry stoichiometry. In contrast, eight to nine influenza A virus hemagglutinin trimers function cooperatively to achieve membrane fusion and virus entry, using a pH-dependent pathway. The different entry requirements for cooperativity among Env trimers for retroviruses and influenza A virus may influence viral strategies for replication and evasion of the immune system.","['Yang, Xinzhen', 'Kurteva, Svetla', 'Ren, Xinping', 'Lee, Sandra', 'Sodroski, Joseph']","['Yang X', 'Kurteva S', 'Ren X', 'Lee S', 'Sodroski J']","['Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Department of Cancer Immunology and AIDS, 44 Binney Street, JFB 824, Boston, MA 02115, USA. xinzhen_yang@dfci.harvard.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,IM,"['Avian Sarcoma Viruses/physiology', 'Cell Line', 'HIV-1/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Influenza A virus/physiology', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/physiology', 'Membrane Fusion', 'Mutation', 'Viral Envelope Proteins/chemistry/*genetics/*physiology']",2005/09/15 09:00,2005/10/22 09:00,['2005/09/15 09:00'],"['2005/09/15 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/10/22 09:00 [medline]', '2005/09/15 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Virol. 2005 Oct;79(19):12132-47. doi: 10.1128/JVI.79.19.12132-12147.2005.,"['R37 AI024755/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'AI31783/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AI031783/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'U01 AI046725/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'AI46725/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'AI24755/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States']",['0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)'],,"['79/19/12132 [pii]', '10.1128/JVI.79.19.12132-12147.2005 [doi]']",,,,,PMC1211524,,,,,,,,,,,

The diallelic SNP has been located in the 3'-untranslated region of the third exon of the porcine LIF gene. Information on 955 litter records from 273 genotyped sows was used in the analyses with respect to the number of piglets born alive. To identify possible pleiotropic marker effects, the growth and carcass traits ADG and backfat thickness were tested for associations with the SNP within the LIF gene in this population. At the LIF locus, the allele frequencies were 0.27 for the A allele and 0.73 for the B allele. There was an indication of an additive effect on the number of piglets born alive, and a significant dominance effect of the B allele was observed for first, second, and third to 10th parities (P = 0.044). The dominance effect for the first parity amounted to -0.73 +/- 0.36 (P = 0.047).

Evidence of a tumor suppressor function for the Plks in human neoplasia is lacking. Here, we report that Snk/Plk2 is transcriptionally down-regulated in B-cell neoplasms. Silencing occurs with very high frequency in Burkitt lymphoma (BL) but is also detected in B-cell neoplasms of other types and is associated with aberrant cytosine methylation in the CpG island located at the 5' end of the SNK/PLK2 gene. Silencing is specific to malignant B cells because SNK/PLK2 was unmethylated (and expressed) in primary B lymphocytes, in EBV-immortalized B lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs), and in adenocarcinomas (of the breast) and squamous-cell carcinomas (of the head and neck). Expression of Snk/Plk2 in BL cell lines was restored by demethylating agents. The related PLK1 and PLK3 (FNK/PRK) genes were overexpressed in BL cell lines lacking Snk/Plk2 expression, consistent with functional degeneracy among the Plk family. Ectopic expression of Snk/Plk2 in BL cells resulted in apoptosis, a potential mechanistic basis underlying the strong selective pressure for abrogation of Snk/Plk2 function in B-cell neoplasia.","['Syed, Nelofer', 'Smith, Paul', 'Sullivan, Alexandra', 'Spender, Lindsay C', 'Dyer, Martin', 'Karran, Lorraine', ""O'Nions, Jenny"", 'Allday, Martin', 'Hoffmann, Ingrid', 'Crawford, Dorothy', 'Griffin, Beverley', 'Farrell, Paul J', 'Crook, Tim']","['Syed N', 'Smith P', 'Sullivan A', 'Spender LC', 'Dyer M', 'Karran L', ""O'Nions J"", 'Allday M', 'Hoffmann I', 'Crawford D', 'Griffin B', 'Farrell PJ', 'Crook T']","['Breakthrough Breast Cancer Centre, Institute of Cancer Research, Fulham Rd, London SW3 6JB, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Apoptosis/genetics', 'B-Lymphocytes', 'Cell Cycle Proteins/genetics', 'DNA Methylation/drug effects', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', '*Gene Silencing', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, B-Cell/*genetics', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/*genetics', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/*genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics', '*Transcription, Genetic', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins']",2005/09/15 09:00,2006/01/24 09:00,['2005/09/15 09:00'],"['2005/09/15 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/01/24 09:00 [medline]', '2005/09/15 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 2006 Jan 1;107(1):250-6. doi: 10.1182/blood-2005-03-1194.

A higher ZAP-70 expression was also observed in the pre-B group (P < .001). Remarkably, Syk expression was always preserved, suggesting that ZAP-70 expression is not substitutive of Syk. At the protein level, ZAP-70 was evaluated on 39 newly diagnosed ALL patients (25 adults, 14 children) and was detected in 23 cases (59%). ZAP-70 expression was consistently found in Ig mu+ cases. Evaluation of long-term outcome in cases without molecular abnormalities showed that the higher levels of ZAP-70 were coupled to a higher relapse rate.

A major mechanism of antifolate resistance is loss of RFC (SLC19A1) gene expression due to decreased GC-box-dependent transcription. However, despite the poor GC-box binding in multiple antifolate-resistant cell lines, normal Sp1 levels were retained. Here we explored the post-translational modifications that may disrupt Sp1 function. Phospho-affinity purification of nuclear proteins revealed that resistant cells contained approximately 8-fold more phosphorylated Sp1 than parental cells; treatment of nuclear proteins from these cells with alkaline phosphatase restored GC-box binding. As protein kinase A phosphorylates Sp1, resistant cells were treated with various cAMP-reactive agents, revealing no apparent effect on GC-box binding except for the general phosphodiesterase inhibitor IBMX. As cGMP levels also may be affected by IBMX, resistant cells were treated with 8-pCPT-cGMP, resulting in the complete restoration of GC-box binding, luciferase reporter activity, and RFC mRNA levels. This restoration was abolished in the presence of the protein phosphatase 2A inhibitor (PP2A) okadaic acid. Importantly, whereas resistant cells showed multiple phosphorylated Sp1 forms barely detectable in parental cells, treatment with 8-pCPT-cGMP resulted in their elimination; this disappearance, however, was prevented by the copresence of okadaic acid. These findings provide the first evidence that loss of RFC gene expression in antifolate-resistant cells is associated with an inhibitory Sp1 phosphorylation that can be eliminated by a cGMP-dependent activation of PP2A.","['Stark, Michal', 'Assaraf, Yehuda G']","['Stark M', 'Assaraf YG']","['Department of Biology, Technion-Israel Institute of Technology, Haifa 32000, Israel.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['1-Methyl-3-isobutylxanthine/pharmacology', 'Alkaline Phosphatase/metabolism', 'Binding Sites', 'Cyclic AMP/metabolism', 'Cyclic AMP-Dependent Protein Kinases/metabolism', 'Cyclic GMP/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Down-Regulation', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Folic Acid Antagonists/*pharmacology', 'GC Rich Sequence', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/drug therapy/genetics/*metabolism', 'Luciferases/metabolism', 'Membrane Transport Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Nuclear Proteins', 'Okadaic Acid/pharmacology', 'Phosphodiesterase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Phosphoprotein Phosphatases/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Phosphorylation', 'Platelet Aggregation Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/genetics', 'Protein Phosphatase 2', 'Protein Processing, Post-Translational', 'Reduced Folate Carrier Protein', 'Sp1 Transcription Factor/*metabolism', 'Thionucleotides/pharmacology', '*Transcription, Genetic', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2005/09/15 09:00,2006/02/08 09:00,['2005/09/15 09:00'],"['2005/09/15 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/02/08 09:00 [medline]', '2005/09/15 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 2006 Jan 15;107(2):708-15. doi: 10.1182/blood-2005-07-2743.

At present, most analyses of checkpoint use the flow cytometry (FCM) based on DNA histogram to detect cell cycle distribution. This study was designed to set up and evaluate a new method, Cyclins/DNA multiparameter FCM based on the model of late G1 phase (G1L) checkpoint, for analyzing cell cycle checkpoint. METHODS: After irradiation by ultraviolet (UV), human acute lymphatic leukemia MOLT-4 cells were gathered and fixed at different time points, and divided into 2 groups. In one group, the total G0/G1 phase cells were calculated by Modifit software using DNA histogram method; in the other group, fluorescence intensity and threshold of Cyclin E in G1L cells and G0/G1 phase cells were quantitatively analyzed by Cyclins/DNA multiparameter method. RESULTS: When analyzed by DNA histogram method, the percentage of G0/G1 phase cells was unchanged after irradiated for 0-4 h, but increased to 12.6% after irradiated for 6 h. When analyzed by Cyclins/DNA multiparameter method, the Cyclin E fluorescence intensity of G1L cells was increased from 295.1 (control) to 341.2 (15.6%) after irradiated for 1 h, and increased to 577.6 (95.7%) with the threshold increased from 2.0 (control) to 5.4 after irradiated for 6 h; G1L cells was slightly decreased after irradiated for 6 h when the apoptosis rate was 5.61%, and early G1 phase (G1E) cells was increased slowly.

Recent studies showed that VEGF-C and its receptors also expressed on hematological tumor cells, but their effects on leukemic cells are unclear. This study was to explore the effects of recombinant VEGF-C secreted from VEGF-C cDNA-transfected CHO (CHO/VEGF-C) cells on proliferation and chemotherapy-induced apoptosis of leukemic cells. METHODS: The effect of recombinant VEGF-C (in the supernatants of CHO/VEGF-C cells) on angiogenesis was observed using the chicken chorioallantoic membrane model. The expression of VEGFR-2 and VEGFR-3 on leukemic cell lines TF-1, K562, HEL, NB4, HL-60, MR2, U937,SHI-1, and RPMI8226 was detected by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and flow cytometry (FCM). The effect of VEGF-C on the proliferation of NB4 and K562 cells was assessed by MTT assay; its effect on the apoptosis of NB4 cells, which were treated with chemotherapeutic agents [etoposide (VP-16), daunorubicin (DNR), or arsenic trioxide (As2O3)], was investigated by FCM with Annexin V/PI double staining. The supernatant of CHO/pcDNA3.1 cells was used as control. RESULTS: The recombinant VEGF-C induced angiogenesis in the chicken chorioallantoic membrane model. VEGFR-3 was expressed in NB4, HEL, and RPMI8226 cells; VEGFR-2 was expressed in HEL and TF-1 cells. Compared with the controls, the recombinant VEGF-C promoted the proliferation of NB4 cells (VEGFR-3(+)) (P(24h)=0.006, P(48h)=0.018), but had no effect on K562 cells (VEGFR-3(-)); it inhibited the chemotherapy-induced apoptosis of NB4 cells (P(VP-16)=0.019, P(DNR)=0.013, P(As2O3)=0.042).

METHODS: Review of 290 patients who received myeloablative conditioning prior to allo-BMT and cyclosporine/FK-506 identified 21 (7.2%) patients with neurotoxicity confirmed by computed tomography or magnetic resonance. Underlying malignancy necessitating allo-BMT included leukemias (67%), lymphoma (10%), myelodysplastic syndrome (10%), and multiple myeloma (MM). Frequency of neurotoxicity by disease was compared. RESULTS: The highest incidence of neurotoxicity was present with MM (25%), whereas the lowest incidence was present with lymphoma (2.7%). Other diseases demonstrated intermediate incidence, including acute leukemias (10%), myelodysplastic syndrome (6.4%), and chronic myelogenous leukemia (4.9%). CONCLUSION: Cyclosporine/FK-506 neurotoxicity varied according to the underlying malignancy. The variable susceptibility to the development of neurotoxicity in this population may depend on the interaction of host vasculature with disease specific factors.

One of the possibilities to circumvent glucocorticoid resistance is the use of new compounds, such as cortivazol (CVZ), which has two binding sites for the glucocorticoid receptor. AIM: Analysis of ex vivo sensitivity to cortivazol and other glucocorticoids in childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia, as well as the relationship to anticancer therapy outcome. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Leukemic samples from 60 children with ALL were tested by the M7T assay for glucocorticoid resistance. Cell cycle before and after ex vivo glucocorticoid treatment was analyzed by flow cytometry. RESULTS: Although all tested glucocorticoids presented significant cross-resistance, CVZ showed high antileukemic activity. The equivalent activity of CVZ was 165-fold higher than prednisolone, 7.ZS5-fold higher than dexamethasone and 2.8-fold higher than betamethasone. CVZ showed relatively better cytotoxicity than other glucocorticoids in prednisolone-poor-responders. CVZ, like other glucocorticoids, caused cell cycle arrest in the GI-phase, and increased the percentage of apoptotic cells to a greater extent than other glucocorticoids. The results of antileukemic therapy were strongly related to the ex vivo resistance to all tested glucocorticoids. CONCLUSION: Cortivazol has potent antileukemic activity in childhood ALL. Its activity is related to cell cycle arrest and induction of apoptosis.","['Styczynski, Jan', 'Kurylak, Andrzej', 'Wysocki, Mariusz']","['Styczynski J', 'Kurylak A', 'Wysocki M']","[""Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Ludwik Rydygier's Collegium Medicum of Bydgoszcz, Nicolaus Copernicus University of Torun, Poland. jan.styczynski@wp.pl""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Greece,Anticancer Res,Anticancer research,8102988,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Female', 'Glucocorticoids/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Lymphocytes/drug effects/pathology', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Prednisolone/pharmacology', 'Pregnatrienes/*pharmacology', 'Prognosis']",2005/09/15 09:00,2005/11/03 09:00,['2005/09/15 09:00'],"['2005/09/15 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/11/03 09:00 [medline]', '2005/09/15 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Anticancer Res. 2005 May-Jun;25(3B):2253-8.,,"['0 (Glucocorticoids)', '0 (Pregnatrienes)', '9PHQ9Y1OLM (Prednisolone)', 'YM183K0H63 (cortivazol)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Genetic variations in folate metabolism are believed to contribute to the risk of acute lymphoblastic leukemia, colon, esophageal and stomach cancer, as well as cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases. MTHFR C677T and A1298C polymorphisms are known to be risk factors for gastric cancer in the Chinese population. Therefore, we hypothesized that the MTHFR polymorphisms are associated with the risk of stomach cancer in Korean subjects. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We conducted a Korean population-based case-control study to examine the relationship between genetic polymorphisms in MTHFR and risk of stomach cancer. The study subjects were 133 patients with stomach cancer and 445 population controls, matched according to sex and age. Genomic DNA was extracted from blood samples of the controls and from surgically resected ""normal"" tissues adjacent to the tumor of stomach cancer patients. MTHFR genotypes at the C677T and A1298C sites were analyzed by PCR-based RFLP methods. RESULTS: We found no evidence for an association between the MTHFR C677T and A1298C polymorphisms and stomach cancer in any of the subjects. The adjusted odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals for MTHFR C677T were 0.924 (0.581-1.469) for 677CT versus 677CC wild-type and 1.147 (0.850-1.549) for 677TT versus 677CC, and for MTHFR A1298C, they were 1.114 (0.695-1.783) for 1298AC versus 1298AA wild-type and 0.834 (0.284-2.450) for 1298CC versus 1298AA. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that the MTHFR C677T and A1298C polymorphisms by themselves do not play an important role in the etiology of stomach cancer in the Korean population.","['Kim, Jin Kyeoung', 'Kim, Sehyun', 'Han, Jin Hee', 'Kim, Hyo Jin', 'Chong, So Young', 'Hong, Seong Pyo', 'Hwang, Seong Gyu', 'Ahn, Jung Yong', 'Cha, Kwang Yul', 'Oh, Doyeun', 'Kim, Nam Keun']","['Kim JK', 'Kim S', 'Han JH', 'Kim HJ', 'Chong SY', 'Hong SP', 'Hwang SG', 'Ahn JY', 'Cha KY', 'Oh D', 'Kim NK']","['Institute for Clinical Research, 2Graduate School of Life Science and Biotechnology, College of Medicine, Pochon CHA University, Seongnam 463-712, South Korea.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Greece,Anticancer Res,Anticancer research,8102988,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Alleles', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Female', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genotype', 'Humans', 'Korea', 'Male', 'Methylenetetrahydrofolate Reductase (NADPH2)/*genetics', 'Middle Aged', 'Polymorphism, Genetic', 'Risk Factors', 'Stomach Neoplasms/*enzymology/*genetics']",2005/09/15 09:00,2005/11/03 09:00,['2005/09/15 09:00'],"['2005/09/15 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/11/03 09:00 [medline]', '2005/09/15 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Anticancer Res. 2005 May-Jun;25(3B):2249-52.,,['EC 1.5.1.20 (Methylenetetrahydrofolate Reductase (NADPH2))'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recently, attention has focused on the estrogen-like and carcinogenic adverse effects of BPA and HQ. Thus, it is important to investigate the cytotoxicity and apoptosis-inducing activity of these compounds. BPA and HQ reduced the viable cell number of human promyelocytic leukemia (HL-60), human oral squamous cell carcinoma (HSC-2) and human submandibular gland (HSG) cell lines in a concentration-dependent manner. The cytotoxic activity of HQ, but not of BPA, was significantly reduced by the addition of N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC). In biomimetic studies of the prooxidant/antioxidant activity of thiols during oxidation of BPA or HQ, the radical-scavenging activities of mixtures of BPA or HQ and 2-mercapto-1-methylimidazole (MMI, a thiol) were investigated by the induction period method. BPA without MMI showed a higher induction period (antioxidant activity) than did HQ, but BPA with MMI did not cause oxygen uptake. In contrast, HQ with MMI caused oxygen uptake, suggesting formation of MMI thiyl radicals during oxidation of HQ followed by reaction with molecular oxygen. This indicates that HQ may produce intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) and provides an explanation for the decrease in the cytotoxicity of HQ by NAC. BPA induced internucleosomal DNA fragmentation, a biochemical marker of apoptosis, only in HL-60 cells. BPA activated caspase-9 and caspase-3, suggesting induction of apoptosis via caspase activation by the caspase recruitment domain. The cytotoxicity of BPA was 2-fold less than that of HQ, whereas the apoptosis-inducing activity of BPA was 10-fold less than that of HQ.","['Terasaka, Hiroshi', 'Kadoma, Yoshinori', 'Sakagami, Hiroshi', 'Fujisawa, Seiichiro']","['Terasaka H', 'Kadoma Y', 'Sakagami H', 'Fujisawa S']","['Department of Oral Diagnosis, Meikai University School of Dentistry, Saitama, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Greece,Anticancer Res,Anticancer research,8102988,IM,"['Acetylcysteine/pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*pharmacology', 'Antioxidants/administration & dosage/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Benzhydryl Compounds', 'Carcinoma, Squamous Cell/drug therapy/enzymology/pathology', 'Caspase 3', 'Caspase 8', 'Caspase 9', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Free Radical Scavengers/pharmacology', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Hydroquinones/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Imidazoles/administration & dosage/pharmacology', 'Mouth Neoplasms/drug therapy/enzymology/pathology', 'Nucleosomes/drug effects', 'Phenols/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism', 'Submandibular Gland/cytology/drug effects']",2005/09/15 09:00,2005/11/03 09:00,['2005/09/15 09:00'],"['2005/09/15 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/11/03 09:00 [medline]', '2005/09/15 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Anticancer Res. 2005 May-Jun;25(3B):2241-7.,,"['0 (2-mercapto-1-methylimidazole)', '0 (Antioxidants)', '0 (Benzhydryl Compounds)', '0 (Free Radical Scavengers)', '0 (Hydroquinones)', '0 (Imidazoles)', '0 (Nucleosomes)', '0 (Phenols)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP8 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP9 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 8)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 9)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'MLT3645I99 (bisphenol A)', 'WYQ7N0BPYC (Acetylcysteine)', 'XV74C1N1AE (hydroquinone)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We expected that conjugates based on glycated fibrinogen would reveal higher antileukemic activity because of decreased plasmin digestibility and a higher retention rate of glycated fibrinogen in the body. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fibrinogen was glycated using a high-temperature procedure at 65-85 degrees C. Glycated fibrinogens were examined with respect to their ability to clot and susceptibility to plasmin digestion. Native fibrinogen (F) and fibrinogens glycated at 65 and 73 degrees C (F65 and F73) were conjugated with MTX and tested in mice bearing P388 leukemia, at a dose of 40 mg of MTX per kg of body weight. RESULTS: Glycated fibrinogens retained their ability to clot. Compared to native fibrinogen, they were more resistant to digestion by plasmin. All tested conjugates revealed higher antitumor activity than the free drug. Increases in average lifespan over the control group were 34% for free MTX, 137% for F-MTX, 151% for F65-MTX and 91% for F73-MTX. The differences between the antitumor activities of all conjugates were not statistically significant. CONCLUSION: It seems necessary to compare the antitumor activities of MTX conjugates based on native and glycated fibrinogen in different tumor models, to demonstrate the expected differences.","['Kanska, Urszula', 'Omar, Mohamed Salah', 'Budzynska, Renata', 'Nevozhay, Dmitry', 'Jagiello, Monika', 'Opolski, Adam', 'Boratynski, Janusz']","['Kanska U', 'Omar MS', 'Budzynska R', 'Nevozhay D', 'Jagiello M', 'Opolski A', 'Boratynski J']","['Laboratory of Biomedical Chemistry, Department of Experimental Oncology, Institute of Immunology and Experimental Therapy, Polish Academy of Sciences, Wroclaw, Poland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Greece,Anticancer Res,Anticancer research,8102988,IM,"['Animals', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'Fibrinogen/*analogs & derivatives/chemistry/pharmacology', 'Fibrinolysin/chemistry/metabolism', 'Glycosylation', 'Hot Temperature', 'Leukemia P388/*drug therapy', 'Methotrexate/*analogs & derivatives/chemistry/pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Inbred DBA']",2005/09/15 09:00,2005/11/03 09:00,['2005/09/15 09:00'],"['2005/09/15 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/11/03 09:00 [medline]', '2005/09/15 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Anticancer Res. 2005 May-Jun;25(3B):2229-34.,,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '9001-32-5 (Fibrinogen)', 'EC 3.4.21.7 (Fibrinolysin)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In order to study the role of glutathione in 4-HPR-induced apoptosis, the levels of this antioxidant were analyzed in cell lines which are sensitive and resistant to the effects of 4-HPR, and the effect of the modulation of glutathione levels on 4-HPR cytotoxicity was characterized. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Mitochondrial membrane potential (deltaPsim) and the levels of glutathione were measured by flow cytometry. A fluorometric assay was used to measure intracellular ROS generation and Western blot was employed to analyze tissue transglutaminase expression. RESULTS: 4-HPR generated large quantities of ROS in cell lines which expressed low glutathione levels, these cells being the most sensitive to the retinoid. The sensitivity of leukemia cells to 4-HPR could be modulated, either by increasing intracellular glutathione contents using all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA), or by decreasing it using DL-buthionine-S,R-sulfoximine (BSO). ATRA increased the level of expression of tissue transglutaminase, whereas inhibition of this enzyme led to enhanced apoptosis. CONCLUSION: Our findings indicate that the glutathione content contributes to determining the sensitivity of cells to 4-HPR and points to the potential application of glutathione-inhibiting agents as enhancers in 4-HPR-based therapies.","['Morales, Maria-Celia', 'Perez-Yarza, Gorka', 'Nieto-Rementeria, Naiara', 'Boyano, Maria-Dolores', 'Jangi, Muhialdin', 'Atencia, Rafael', 'Asumendi, Aintzane']","['Morales MC', 'Perez-Yarza G', 'Nieto-Rementeria N', 'Boyano MD', 'Jangi M', 'Atencia R', 'Asumendi A']","['Department of Cell Biology and Histology, Faculty of Medicine and Dentistry, University of the Basque Country, Leioa- 48940, Bizkaia, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Greece,Anticancer Res,Anticancer research,8102988,IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects/physiology', 'Buthionine Sulfoximine/administration & dosage/pharmacology', 'Cadaverine/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Fenretinide/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Glutathione/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/drug therapy/enzymology/metabolism/pathology', 'Oxidative Stress/drug effects', 'Transglutaminases/antagonists & inhibitors/biosynthesis/metabolism', 'Tretinoin/administration & dosage/pharmacology']",2005/09/15 09:00,2005/11/03 09:00,['2005/09/15 09:00'],"['2005/09/15 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/11/03 09:00 [medline]', '2005/09/15 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Anticancer Res. 2005 May-Jun;25(3B):1945-51.,,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '187EJ7QEXL (Fenretinide)', '5072-26-4 (Buthionine Sulfoximine)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'EC 2.3.2.13 (Transglutaminases)', 'GAN16C9B8O (Glutathione)', 'I9N81SC5HD (monodansylcadaverine)', 'L90BEN6OLL (Cadaverine)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Based on 7969 cases of acute myeloblastic leukemia (AML) and 1252 cases of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) taken from the literature, band 11q23 and/or the MLL gene was involved in 5.2% of AML and 22% of ALL.

Seventy-five different rearrangements involving band 1 q23 have so far been identified, 39 MLL partner genes having been cloned.

We found that WP-1034 induced apoptosis of OCIM2 cells and that induction of apoptosis involved cleavage of caspase 3 and the DNA repair enzyme poly (adenosine diphosphate [ADP]-ribose) polymerase (PARP). Taken together, our data suggest that WP-1034 is a potent inhibitor of AML cell proliferation by inhibition of Stat 3 and 5 and induction of caspase-dependent apoptosis.","['Faderl, Stefan', 'Ferrajoli, Alessandra', 'Harris, David', 'Van, Quin', 'Priebe, Waldemar', 'Estrov, Zeev']","['Faderl S', 'Ferrajoli A', 'Harris D', 'Van Q', 'Priebe W', 'Estrov Z']","['The Department of Leukemia of The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Greece,Anticancer Res,Anticancer research,8102988,IM,"['Acrylamides/*pharmacology', 'Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Caspase 3', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Growth Processes/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Janus Kinase 1', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/drug therapy/enzymology/pathology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*drug therapy/enzymology/pathology', 'Male', 'Milk Proteins/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Nitriles/*pharmacology', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor', 'STAT5 Transcription Factor', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Trans-Activators/*antagonists & inhibitors']",2005/09/15 09:00,2005/11/03 09:00,['2005/09/15 09:00'],"['2005/09/15 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/11/03 09:00 [medline]', '2005/09/15 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Anticancer Res. 2005 May-Jun;25(3B):1841-50.,,"['0 (Acrylamides)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Milk Proteins)', '0 (Nitriles)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT3 protein, human)', '0 (STAT5 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (WP-1034)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (JAK1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 1)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The mechanisms of resistance to F-ara-A were investigated in a newly established variant of L1210 mouse leukemia cells (L1210/F). L1210/F was more than 41-fold more resistant to F-ara-A than the parental cell line and had a 55% lower dCK activity. Interestingly, L1210/F showed a modest level of cross-resistance to deoxycytidine analogues phosphorylated by dCK, for instance, 1-beta-D-arabinofuranosylcytosine (ara-C). The comparative study of F-ara-A and ara-C demonstrated that the difference in the accumulation of their respective triphosphates was minor. In contrast, the incorporation of F-ara-A into DNA was strikingly suppressed compared with that of ara-C. In general, the high natural triphosphate levels interfere with corresponding analogue incorporation into DNA. The deoxyadenosine triphosphate (dATP) and deoxycytidine triphosphate pool sizes in L1210/F cells were increased by 4.9-fold and 1.9-fold, respectively, compared with the parental cells. Treatment with hydroxyurea increased the ratio of F-ara-ATP to dATP 2.1-fold and enhanced the action of F-ara-A in L1210/F. This is the first cell line to show that the profoundly defective incorporation of F-ara-A into DNA during competition with excess dATP confers a high degree of resistance to F-ara-A.","['Yoshio, Nobuyuki', 'Kawai, Yasukazu', 'Hori, Hiroki', 'Ueda, Takanori']","['Yoshio N', 'Kawai Y', 'Hori H', 'Ueda T']","['First Department of Internal Medicine, Faculty of Medical Sciences, University of Fukui, Fukui, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Japan,Int J Hematol,International journal of hematology,9111627,IM,"['Animals', 'Binding, Competitive', 'Biotransformation', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cytarabine/pharmacokinetics', 'DNA/*metabolism', 'Deoxyadenine Nucleotides/analysis/*metabolism', 'Deoxycytosine Nucleotides/analysis', 'Drug Interactions', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Hydroxyurea/pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Nucleosides/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Vidarabine/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacokinetics']",2005/09/15 09:00,2005/10/19 09:00,['2005/09/15 09:00'],"['2005/09/15 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/10/19 09:00 [medline]', '2005/09/15 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Int J Hematol. 2005 Jun;81(5):405-12. doi: 10.1532/ijh97.05008.,,"['0 (Deoxyadenine Nucleotides)', '0 (Deoxycytosine Nucleotides)', '0 (Nucleosides)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', ""2056-98-6 (2'-deoxycytidine 5'-triphosphate)"", '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', ""K8KCC8SH6N (2'-deoxyadenosine triphosphate)"", 'P2K93U8740 (fludarabine)', 'X6Q56QN5QC (Hydroxyurea)']",,['10.1532/ijh97.05008 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A block in normal differentiation is a major contributing factor in the development of solid tumors and leukemias. Cells from patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) frequently harbor mutated or dysregulated transcription factor genes, suggesting their involvement in leukemogenesis. As a consequence, these alterations diminish the pool of available molecules of a small number of critical transcription factors, such as CCAAT enhancer binding proteins, PU.1, GATA-1, and AML-1. In this review, we focus on the mechanisms of how this functional pool of transcription factors is maintained during normal and malignant hematopoiesis, including direct protein-protein interactions, competition for DNA binding, and the control of transcription factor genes by proximal and distal regulatory elements. Results of recent studies of mice carrying hypomorphic PU.1 alleles have indicated that reduction in the expression of a single transcription factor is capable of predisposing mice to AML.

METHODS: Ninety adult patients with MDS received oral topotecan (1.2 mg/m2) either once a day for 10 days or twice a day for 5 days every 21 days for up to six cycles. Dosing histories were collected using electronic monitoring devices fitted to medication vials. Topotecan plasma concentrations were measured, and exposure was determined by a sparse sampling approach and Bayesian estimation methods. Relationships between exposure and clinical response and toxicity were evaluated using logistic regression. RESULTS: Overall adherence was excellent with 90% of patients taking the prescribed number of doses in cycle 1. Adherence did not differ between the two regimens. Topotecan pharmacokinetics were described using a one compartment open model with first order absorption and elimination. Pharmacokinetic parameter estimates did not differ between the once a day and twice a day dosing groups. While topotecan exposure was greater in the twice a day arm compared to the once a day arm due to drug accumulation, exposure did not correlate with clinical response. However, the probability of needing a platelet transfusion in the twice a day arm was significantly increased (by 35%) as a result of greater steady-state plasma topotecan concentrations. CONCLUSIONS: Adherence is high in patients with MDS receiving oral topotecan, whether the drug is prescribed once or twice daily. The optimal schedule cannot be determined from this study, as there was no evident relationship between any pharmacokinetic parameter and clinical response.","['Klein, Cheri E', 'Kastrissios, Helen', 'Miller, Antonius A', 'Hollis, Donna', 'Yu, Daohai', 'Rosner, Gary L', 'Grinblatt, David L', 'Larson, Richard A', 'Ratain, Mark J']","['Klein CE', 'Kastrissios H', 'Miller AA', 'Hollis D', 'Yu D', 'Rosner GL', 'Grinblatt DL', 'Larson RA', 'Ratain MJ']","['Department of Biopharmaceutical Sciences, The University of Illinois at Chicago, 833 South Wood Street (MC 865), Chicago, IL 60612, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol,Cancer chemotherapy and pharmacology,7806519,IM,"['Administration, Oral', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage/*pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*drug therapy', '*Patient Compliance', 'Topotecan/administration & dosage/*pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology']",2005/09/15 09:00,2006/01/18 09:00,['2005/09/15 09:00'],"['2004/12/02 00:00 [received]', '2005/03/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2005/09/15 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/01/18 09:00 [medline]', '2005/09/15 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol. 2006 Jan;57(2):199-206. doi: 10.1007/s00280-005-0023-6.

Although Rb is known to be an upstream negative regulator of Abl protein tyrosine kinase, we propose here that Rb also functions as a downstream effector of Abl that plays a positive role in survival of Abl-dependent human tumor cells, including Bcr/Abl-positive chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML). We show that Rb is constitutively phosphorylated at tyrosine in Abl-dependent tumor cells, and that Abl phosphorylates Rb specifically at Y805 within the C-terminal domain of the molecule. We also show that ectopic expression of Rb induces apoptosis in Abl-dependent tumor cells by inhibiting the Abl tyrosine kinase activity, and that Rb-induced apoptosis is compromised by Abl-catalysed phosphorylation of Rb at Y805.

Thus, our findings suggest that Abl-catalysed tyrosine phosphorylation of Rb is necessary for survival of Abl-dependent human tumor cells, and raises the possibility that this phosphorylated Rb can be a molecular target for cancer therapy aimed at inducing apoptosis of Abl-dependent tumor cells, such as Bcr/Abl-positive CML.","['Nagano, K', 'Itagaki, C', 'Izumi, T', 'Nunomura, K', 'Soda, Y', 'Tani, K', 'Takahashi, N', 'Takenawa, T', 'Isobe, T']","['Nagano K', 'Itagaki C', 'Izumi T', 'Nunomura K', 'Soda Y', 'Tani K', 'Takahashi N', 'Takenawa T', 'Isobe T']","['Division of Proteomics Research, Institute of Medical Science, University of Tokyo, Minato-ku, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,IM,"['Apoptosis', 'Catalysis', 'Cell Survival', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Neoplasms/enzymology/*pathology', 'Phosphorylation', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-abl/*physiology', 'RNA Interference', 'Retinoblastoma Protein/*physiology']",2005/09/15 09:00,2006/03/03 09:00,['2005/09/15 09:00'],"['2005/09/15 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/03/03 09:00 [medline]', '2005/09/15 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2006 Jan 26;25(4):493-502. doi: 10.1038/sj.onc.1208996.,,"['0 (Retinoblastoma Protein)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-abl)']",,"['1208996 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.onc.1208996 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The fundamental role of Chk2 is to regulate the network of genome-surveillance pathways that coordinate cell-cycle progression with DNA repair and cell survival or death. Defects in Chk2 contribute to the development of both hereditary and sporadic human cancers. We now present evidence that the human T-cell leukemia virus type-1 (HTLV-1) Tax protein directly interacts with Chk2 and the kinase activity of Chk2 is inhibited by Tax. The physical interaction of Chk2 and Tax was observed by co-immunoprecipitation assays in HTLV-1-infected T cells (C81) as well as GST pull-down assays using purified proteins. Binding and kinase activity inhibition studies with Tax deletion mutants indicated that at least two domains of Tax mediate the interaction with Chk2. We have analysed the functional consequence of de novo expression of Tax upon the cellular DNA-damage-induced apoptosis, which is mediated by Chk2. Using transient transfection and TUNEL assay, we found that gamma-irradiation-induced apoptosis was decreased in 293T and HCT-116 (p53(-/-)) cells expressing HTLV-1 Tax. Our studies demonstrate an important potential target of Tax in cellular transformation.","['Park, H U', 'Jeong, S-J', 'Jeong, J-H', 'Chung, J H', 'Brady, J N']","['Park HU', 'Jeong SJ', 'Jeong JH', 'Chung JH', 'Brady JN']","['Virus Tumor Biology Section, Laboratory of Cellular Oncology, Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural']",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,IM,"['Apoptosis/*radiation effects', 'Base Sequence', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Line', 'Checkpoint Kinase 2', 'DNA Primers', '*Gamma Rays', 'Gene Products, tax/metabolism/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Immunoprecipitation', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Transcriptional Activation', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/physiology']",2005/09/15 09:00,2006/03/03 09:00,['2005/09/15 09:00'],"['2005/09/15 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/03/03 09:00 [medline]', '2005/09/15 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2006 Jan 19;25(3):438-47. doi: 10.1038/sj.onc.1209059.,['Intramural NIH HHS/United States'],"['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', 'EC 2.7.1.11 (Checkpoint Kinase 2)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (CHEK2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)']",,"['1209059 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.onc.1209059 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To investigate the role of PLZF in the regulation of cytoadhesion molecules involved in the mobilization of hemopoietic cells, we have analysed PLZF and very late antigen 4 (VLA-4) expression in normal and leukemic cells. In hematopoiesis, we found a negative correlation between PLZF and VLA-4 expression, except for the megakaryocytic lineage. In contrast, we observed a positive correlation between PLZF and VLA-4 expression in a panel of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) samples. In K562 cells expressing PLZF (K562-PLZF), we found that the expression of VLA-4 and c-kit was downmodulated. We have investigated the possibility for VLA-4 or the c-kit receptor to be direct target genes of PLZF in K562-PLZF cells and identified a PLZF DNA-binding site within the VLA-4 promoter. Furthermore, decrease in VLA-4 expression was associated with loss of adhesion on fibronectin-coated plates, which promotes drug-induced apoptosis of K562-PLZF cells. Our findings indicate that VLA-4 is a potential target gene of PLZF. However, in primary AMLs the control of PLZF on VLA-4 expression is lost. Altogether, we suggest that VLA-4 modulation by PLZF may represent an important step in the control of normal and leukemic cell mobilization.","['Quaranta, M T', 'Spinello, I', 'Testa, U', 'Mariani, G', 'Diverio, D', 'Foa, R', 'Peschle, C', 'Labbaye, C']","['Quaranta MT', 'Spinello I', 'Testa U', 'Mariani G', 'Diverio D', 'Foa R', 'Peschle C', 'Labbaye C']","['1Department of Hematology, Oncology and Molecular Medicine, Istituto Superiore di Sanita, Rome, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Base Sequence', 'Bone Marrow Cells/*immunology', 'DNA Primers', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/metabolism/*physiology', 'Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay', 'Humans', 'Integrin alpha4beta1/genetics/*immunology', 'Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*immunology/pathology', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Zinc Finger Protein', 'Protein Binding', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Transcription Factors/metabolism/*physiology']",2005/09/15 09:00,2006/03/03 09:00,['2005/09/15 09:00'],"['2005/09/15 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/03/03 09:00 [medline]', '2005/09/15 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2006 Jan 19;25(3):399-408. doi: 10.1038/sj.onc.1209060.,,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Integrin alpha4beta1)', '0 (Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Zinc Finger Protein)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '147855-37-6 (ZBTB16 protein, human)']",,"['1209060 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.onc.1209060 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Sixteen patients with APL who were treated with ATRA or As2O3 alone and achieved complete remission (CR) were analyzed. ATRA 45 mg/m2/day was given orally until CR. As2O3 0.15 mg/kg/day was given intravenously until leukemic blasts and promyelocytes were eliminated from the bone marrow. RESULTS: All 7 patients in the ATRA-treated group were primary cases and all 9 patients in the As2O3-treated group were relapsed cases after the achievement of CR with the ATRA. There was no difference in the data before treatment between these two groups. The duration of leukocytopenia and neutropenia during As2O3 treatment was significantly longer than those of ATRA treatment. The nadir of leukocyte and neutrophil counts was observed later in the As2O3-treated group. Terminal neutrophil differentiation was observed more obviously in the ATRA-treated group. The red blood cell count and hemoglobin concentration decreased significantly at the end of As2O3 treatment and were lower than those of ATRA treatment. Platelets recovered earlier in the ATRA-treated group. Coagulation parameters were not significantly changed between the two groups. CONCLUSION: In comparison with ATRA treatment, the recovery of several components in the peripheral blood cells was delayed in As2O3 treatment.

In order to minimize chemotherapy toxicity and avoid eventual hospitalization and psychological and financial burdens we have applied since 1988, for the first time in Iran, a treatment regimen based on subsequently revised DAL-HD 85-90 and later GPOH-HD 95 protocols. PATIENTS AND METHODS: During the period 1988-2004, 40 children with HD received DAL/GPOH-HD-adapted treatment; 25 males (62.5%) and 15 females (37.5%) (male/female ratio 1.7; age 4-14 years, mean 8.8). Clinical evaluation and staging was performed in all patients. Constitutional symptoms: 24 patients were asymptomatic (A; 60%) and 16 had constitutional complaints (B; 40%). Staging was as follows: stage I; seven (17.5%); II, 11 (27.5%); III, 11 (27.5%); and IV, 11 (27.5%). Histopathology: 22 patients had mixed cellularity (MC; 55%), 13 nodular sclerosis (32.5%), four lymphocyte predominance (LP; 10%) and one patient lymphocyte depletion (2.5%). Stage IA and IIA patients (n = 15) received either OPA x2 (vincristine, prednisolone, doxorubicin) or OPPA x2 or OPEA x2 (vincristine, prednisolone, procarbazine and doxorubicin), the latter receiving etoposide instead of procarbazine, and applied to males. Stages IIB, IIIA/B and IV received OPPA x2, followed by CO(P)P x4 (cyclophosphamide, vincristine, prednisolone in alternate courses and procarbazine). Twenty nine patients (72.5%) received radiotherapy (20-25 Gy); four to the involved field (stage I), 25 to the upper mantel (stage II and also III with either residual or mediastinal mass) and three additionally to spleen and para-aortic lymph nodes. Eleven patients received only chemotherapy. RESULTS: All patients achieved complete remission (CR). Relapse occurred in eight patients (20%); seven stage IV (MC) and one stage IA (LP) with progression to IIIB. Salvage chemotherapy consisted of MOPP/ABVD hybrid; six patients achieved a second sustained remission and three patients died: two due to relapse and progressive disease and the third one in CR, owing to thrombocytopenic hemorrhage and foudroyant pneumonia. The achieved overall and event-free survival was 88.1% and 75.4%, respectively. Aside from minor acute toxicities, three patients demonstrated azoospermia at the age of 18 years and one of these patients suffered non-Hodgkin lymphoma as a second malignancy. HD occurred as a second malignancy in two patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Both received appropriate treatment and are over 10 years in CR. CONCLUSIONS: The DAL/GPOH-HD-based treatment approach proved to achieve long-term sustained cure even in children with advanced HD disease. The essentially outpatient diagnosis and treatment modus did not compromise the disease outcome, and was well tolerated and accepted by the patients and their parents. The employed drugs are easily available and affordable. This treatment approach is suitable for ambulatory use in developing countries. However, male infertility remains the major obstacle to procarbazine and cyclophosphamide use.","['Alebouyeh, M', 'Moussavi, F', 'Haddad-Deylami, H', 'Vossough, P']","['Alebouyeh M', 'Moussavi F', 'Haddad-Deylami H', 'Vossough P']","['Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Shohada Medical Center, Shaheed Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran-Tajrish, Iran. alebouyehm@yahoo.com']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",England,Ann Oncol,Annals of oncology : official journal of the European Society for Medical Oncology,9007735,IM,"['Adolescent', '*Ambulatory Care', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Female', 'Hodgkin Disease/diagnosis/*drug therapy/radiotherapy', 'Humans', 'Iran', 'Male', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/diagnosis/drug therapy/radiotherapy', 'Remission Induction', 'Salvage Therapy', 'Survival Rate']",2005/09/15 09:00,2006/04/06 09:00,['2005/09/15 09:00'],"['2005/09/15 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/04/06 09:00 [medline]', '2005/09/15 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Ann Oncol. 2005 Dec;16(12):1936-40. doi: 10.1093/annonc/mdi401.

Curcumin (diferuloylmethane), the major pigment of the spice turmeric, has anti-tumor activity; however, the effect of curcumin against ATL has not been elucidated. In this study, we examined the effects of curcumin on AP-1 activity in HTLV-1-infected T-cell lines. Curcumin suppressed the constitutive AP-1 DNA-binding and transcriptional activity in HTLV-1-infected T-cell line. Curcumin also inhibited HTLV-1 Tax-induced AP-1 transcriptional activity. JunD was detectable as a major component of the AP-1-DNA complex in HTLV-1-infected T-cell lines using the supershift assay. The expression of JunD was suppressed by curcumin treatment. Curcumin inhibited the growth of HTLV-1-infected T-cell lines by inducing cell cycle arrest followed by apoptosis. Our results suggest that suppression of the constitutively active AP-1 by curcumin is due to, at least in-part, reducing the expression of JunD by curcumin. Inhibition of AP-1 activity by curcumin may be one of the mechanisms responsible for the anti-ATL effect of curcumin. We propose that curcumin is a potentially promising compound for the treatment of ATL.","['Tomita, Mariko', 'Kawakami, Hirochika', 'Uchihara, Jun-nosuke', 'Okudaira, Taeko', 'Masuda, Masato', 'Takasu, Nobuyuki', 'Matsuda, Takehiro', 'Ohta, Takao', 'Tanaka, Yuetsu', 'Mori, Naoki']","['Tomita M', 'Kawakami H', 'Uchihara JN', 'Okudaira T', 'Masuda M', 'Takasu N', 'Matsuda T', 'Ohta T', 'Tanaka Y', 'Mori N']","['Division of Molecular Virology and Oncology, Graduate School of Medicine, University of the Ryukyus, 207 Uehara, Nishihara, Okinawa 903-0215, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Retracted Publication']",England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,IM,"['Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Curcumin/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/drug effects', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Viral/drug effects', 'Genes, pX/drug effects', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/drug therapy/*metabolism/pathology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-jun/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'T-Lymphocytes/*metabolism/pathology/virology', 'Transcription Factor AP-1/*metabolism', 'Transcription, Genetic/drug effects']",2005/09/15 09:00,2006/03/15 09:00,['2005/09/15 09:00'],"['2005/05/23 00:00 [received]', '2005/09/15 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/03/15 09:00 [medline]', '2005/09/15 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 2006 Mar;30(3):313-21. doi: 10.1016/j.leukres.2005.08.004.

In many cases, LPL is associated with Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia (WM), although WM may also be associated with other types of lymphoma. Recent studies have demonstrated that del(6q) is the most common structural abnormality in patients with bone marrow-based LPL. It is unknown whether del(6q) might also be associated with nodal LPL. We, therefore, examined 10 well-characterized LPL involving lymph nodes or other extramedullary tissues for del(6q) using paraffin section interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). Dual-color FISH was performed using a chromosome 6 centromere probe (CEP6) and a probe for 6q21 (RP11-91C23). The latter probe has previously been reported as deleted in up to 63% of cases of bone marrow-based LPL. In contrast, no nuclei containing a del(6q) pattern were identified in any case of extramedullary LPL examined in this study, and 89-98.5% of nuclei contained a normal signal pattern. These results indicate that del(6q) is at least uncommon in nodal LPL, and cannot be employed as a diagnostic marker to identify this type of lymphoma. Furthermore, these findings suggest that nodal LPL and bone marrow-based cases of LPL may be associated with different cytogenetic findings.","['Cook, James R', 'Aguilera, Nadine Ives', 'Reshmi, Shalini', 'Huang, Xin', 'Yu, Zhisheng', 'Gollin, Susanne M', 'Abbondanzo, Susan L', 'Swerdlow, Steven H']","['Cook JR', 'Aguilera NI', 'Reshmi S', 'Huang X', 'Yu Z', 'Gollin SM', 'Abbondanzo SL', 'Swerdlow SH']","['Department of Clinical Pathology, Cleveland Clinic Foundation, Cleveland, OH, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Cancer Genet Cytogenet,Cancer genetics and cytogenetics,7909240,IM,"['Biomarkers, Tumor', '*Chromosome Deletion', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 6', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence/methods', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*genetics', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/genetics']",2005/09/15 09:00,2005/10/19 09:00,['2005/09/15 09:00'],"['2005/03/23 00:00 [received]', '2005/04/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2005/09/15 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/10/19 09:00 [medline]', '2005/09/15 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Genet Cytogenet. 2005 Oct 1;162(1):85-8. doi: 10.1016/j.cancergencyto.2005.04.013.,,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)']",,"['S0165-4608(05)00220-7 [pii]', '10.1016/j.cancergencyto.2005.04.013 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It seems therefore that the prognostic value of the t(12;21) does not vary and that ETV6/RUNX1 rearrangement is an independent indicator of good prognosis.","['Alvarez, Y', 'Coll, M D', 'Ortega, J J', 'Bastida, P', 'Dastugue, N', 'Robert, A', 'Cervera, J', 'Verdeguer, A', 'Tasso, M', 'Aventin, A', 'Guitart, M', 'Caballin, M R']","['Alvarez Y', 'Coll MD', 'Ortega JJ', 'Bastida P', 'Dastugue N', 'Robert A', 'Cervera J', 'Verdeguer A', 'Tasso M', 'Aventin A', 'Guitart M', 'Caballin MR']","['Departamento de Biologia Animal, Biologia Vegetal y Ecologia, Unidad de Antropologia, Facultad de Ciencias, Universidad Autonoma de Barcelona, 08193 Bellaterra (Barcelona), Spain. iolanda.alvarez@uab.es']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Genet Cytogenet,Cancer genetics and cytogenetics,7909240,IM,"['Child', 'Child, Preschool', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 12', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 21', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics/mortality', 'Survival Analysis', '*Translocation, Genetic']",2005/09/15 09:00,2005/10/19 09:00,['2005/09/15 09:00'],"['2004/12/06 00:00 [received]', '2005/02/18 00:00 [revised]', '2005/02/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2005/09/15 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/10/19 09:00 [medline]', '2005/09/15 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Genet Cytogenet. 2005 Oct 1;162(1):21-9. doi: 10.1016/j.cancergencyto.2005.02.019.,,,,"['S0165-4608(05)00120-2 [pii]', '10.1016/j.cancergencyto.2005.02.019 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

STUDY DESIGN: Amniotic fluid from 252 singleton and 46 twin gestations were tested by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for interleukin-1beta, interleukin-1 receptor antagonist, interleukin-4, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, nitric oxide, Clara cell protein 16, leptin, and the 70-kDa heat shock protein. A subset of amniotic fluid was also tested for leukemia inhibitory factor, angiogenin, and migration inhibitory factor-related protein 8 and migration inhibitory factor-related protein 14. Data were analyzed by the Mann-Whitney U test and Spearman rank correlation. RESULTS: Median concentrations of interleukin-1beta, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin-4, Clara cell protein 16, leptin, and angiogenin were increased in amniotic fluid from twins; median levels of the 70-kDa heat shock protein, leukemia inhibitory factor, migration inhibitory factor-related protein 8, and migration inhibitory factor-related protein 14 were highest in amniotic fluid from singletons (P < .001).

Expression of Bmi-1 has been found in all types of myeloid leukemia cells in both humans and mice. This study aimed at assessing the effect of antisense Bmi-1 expression on K562 cells proliferation and p16 protein (p16) expression. METHODS: A transcriptional repressor, Bmi-1 cDNA was cloned by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) of its mRNA from K562 cells. A plasmid expressing antisense Bmi-1 mRNA was then constructed by reverse design of PCR primers and cloned to the plasmid pLNCX2; G418 was added to the medium after the plasmid was successfully introduced in K562 cells by lipofectin-mediated DNA transfection. The effects of the antisense expression on the proliferation of K562 cells were analyzed by using microculture tetrazolium and colony forming. Cell cycle was analyzed by using flow cytometry. The p16 expression of K562 cells was observed by immunofluorescence histochemical stain. RESULTS: K562 cells transfected with antisense Bmi-1 plasmid grew significantly slower than that of controls (the parental K562 and cells transfected with empty plasmid). The colony forming ability of antisense Bmi-1 plasmid transfected cells decreased significantly (P < 0.01) compared with controls. The p16 expression of cells transfected with antisense Bmi-1 was upgraded more apparently than that of controls. CONCLUSION: The antisense Bmi-1 gene can inhibit the growth of K562 cell and upgrade expression of p16 in K562 cells.","['Meng, Xiu-xiang', 'Liu, Wei-hong', 'Liu, Dan-dan', 'Zhao, Xin-yu', 'Su, Ben-li']","['Meng XX', 'Liu WH', 'Liu DD', 'Zhao XY', 'Su BL']","['Department of Laboratory Hematology, School of Laboratory Medicine, Dalian Medical University, Dalian116027, China. xiuxiang_meng@sina.com']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],China,Chin Med J (Engl),Chinese medical journal,7513795,IM,"['Cell Cycle', '*Cell Proliferation', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p16/analysis', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Nuclear Proteins/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics', '*Plasmids', 'Polycomb Repressive Complex 1', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics', 'RNA, Antisense/*physiology', 'Repressor Proteins/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics']",2005/09/15 09:00,2005/10/12 09:00,['2005/09/15 09:00'],"['2005/09/15 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/10/12 09:00 [medline]', '2005/09/15 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Chin Med J (Engl). 2005 Aug 20;118(16):1346-50.,,"['0 (BMI1 protein, human)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p16)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Antisense)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Polycomb Repressive Complex 1)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Vector transduction mimics the HIV-1 entry process and is therefore a safe tool to study HIV-1 entry. RESULTS: Using FLY cells, which express the MLV gag and pol genes, we generated stable producer cell lines that express the HIV-1 envelope gene and a retroviral vector genome encoding the green fluorescent protein (GFP). The BH10 or 89.6 P HIV-1 Env was expressed from a bicistronic vector which allowed the rapid selection of stable cell lines. A codon-usage-optimized synthetic env gene permitted high, Rev-independent Env expression. Vectors generated by these producer cells displayed different sensitivity to entry inhibitors.

To investigate the molecular basis of this disease, we developed a model system to examine the biological activity of EVI1 in a megakaryocyte progenitor cell line. For this purpose, Evi1 was conditionally expressed in human erythroleukaemia cells (HEL) that progress along the megakaryocyte lineage in the presence of 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate (TPA). TPA-stimulated HEL cells normally undergo: (1) growth arrest; (2) altered morphology; (3) endomitosis and (4) characteristic changes in gene expression, including reduction of the erythroid-specific glycophoryn A and elevation of the specific glycoproteins GPIIIa and GPVI. Enforced Evi1 expression alone had no effect upon HEL cell proliferation or differentiation but a phenotype was manifest upon stimulation to differentiate. Evi1-expressing, TPA-treated HEL cells still showed growth arrest, had reduced and enhanced glycophoryn A and GPIIIa mRNA's, respectively, but failed to significantly elevate GPVI mRNA. This was accompanied by inhibition of endomitosis and altered cell morphology. Sustained CDK2 catalytic activity, typically associated with megakaryocyte endomitosis, was dramatically decreased in TPA-stimulated Evi1-expressing HEL cells because of significantly reduced levels of cyclin A. Therefore, enforced Evi1 expression could inhibit megakaryocyte differentiation although retention of some characteristic molecular changes, in combination with a block in endomitosis and altered morphology, suggest a defect in lineage progression. These results suggest that ectopic Evi1 expression contributes to a defective megakaryocyte differentiation programme and is likely to contribute to the phenotype observed in 3q21q26 syndrome leukaemias.","['Kilbey, Anna', 'Alzuherri, Hadi', 'McColl, Joan', 'Cales, Carmela', 'Frampton, Jonathan', 'Bartholomew, Christopher']","['Kilbey A', 'Alzuherri H', 'McColl J', 'Cales C', 'Frampton J', 'Bartholomew C']","['Department of Biological and Biomedical Sciences, Glasgow Caledonian University, Glasgow, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,IM,"['CDC2-CDC28 Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors/physiology', 'Cell Cycle', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 2', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/metabolism/*physiology', 'Hematopoiesis', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/enzymology/metabolism/*pathology', 'MDS1 and EVI1 Complex Locus Protein', 'Megakaryocytes/*cytology/enzymology', 'Mitosis', 'Neoplasm Proteins/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogenes/*physiology', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction/methods', 'Transcription Factors/metabolism/*physiology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2005/09/15 09:00,2005/10/28 09:00,['2005/09/15 09:00'],"['2005/09/15 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/10/28 09:00 [medline]', '2005/09/15 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2005 Sep;130(6):902-11. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.2005.05709.x.,,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (MDS1 and EVI1 Complex Locus Protein)', '0 (MECOM protein, human)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (CDC2-CDC28 Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (CDK2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 2)']",,"['BJH5709 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1365-2141.2005.05709.x [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To investigate the mechanisms underlying this phenomenon, we performed a thorough study of surface and intracellular expression of the B-cell receptor (BCR) components in B-CLL cells using flow cytometry. There was an heterogeneous pattern of expression. Overall, 20 of 22 samples showed reduced sIgM levels, compared with normal B cells. Among them, three (15%) had very low to undetectable intracellular IgM levels and variable amounts of CD79a and CD79b; nine (45%) had low intracellular CD79b levels but appreciable levels of IgM and CD79a; and eight (40%) had relatively normal intracellular levels of all BCR components. To investigate whether surface BCR levels could be controlled by the rate of CD79b synthesis, adenoviral vectors encoding CD79b were generated and used for gene transfer experiments. Delivery of CD79b to non-B cells transfected with IgM and CD79a lead to high-level expression of a functional BCR. Moreover, CD79b gene transfer in a B cell line derived from a B-CLL patient and characterised by low intracellular levels of endogenous CD79b consistently increased sIgM levels.

Samples of chronic NK lymphocytosis, an NK-cell disorder with an indolent clinical course, were resistant to both drugs. Our study clearly separated two major categories of NK-cell disorders and ALL according to the sensitivity to DXR and l-asparaginase. We examined asparagine synthetase levels by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RQ-PCR) and immunostaining in these samples. At least in nasal-type NK-cell lymphoma, there was a good correlation among asparagine synthetase expression, in vitro sensitivity and clinical response to l-asparaginase. In aggressive NK-cell leukaemia, although asparagine synthetase expression was high at both mRNA and protein levels, l-asparaginase induced considerable apoptosis. Furthermore, samples of each disease entity occupied a distinct area in two-dimensional plotting with asparagine synthetase mRNA level (RQ-PCR) and in vitrol-asparaginase sensitivity (TUNEL assay). We confirmed rather specific anti-tumour activity of l-asparaginase against NK-cell tumours in vitro, which provides an experimental background to the clinical use of l-asparaginase for NK-cell tumours.","['Ando, Miki', 'Sugimoto, Koichi', 'Kitoh, Toshiyuki', 'Sasaki, Makoto', 'Mukai, Kouichi', 'Ando, Jun', 'Egashira, Motoki', 'Schuster, Sheldon M', 'Oshimi, Kazuo']","['Ando M', 'Sugimoto K', 'Kitoh T', 'Sasaki M', 'Mukai K', 'Ando J', 'Egashira M', 'Schuster SM', 'Oshimi K']","['Department of Haematology, Juntendo University School of Medicine, Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Asparaginase/*pharmacology', 'Aspartate-Ammonia Ligase/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Doxorubicin/pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Humans', 'In Situ Nick-End Labeling', '*Killer Cells, Natural', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/enzymology/*pathology', 'Lymphocytosis/pathology', 'Lymphoma, T-Cell/enzymology/*pathology', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'RNA, Neoplasm/genetics']",2005/09/15 09:00,2005/10/28 09:00,['2005/09/15 09:00'],"['2005/09/15 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/10/28 09:00 [medline]', '2005/09/15 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2005 Sep;130(6):860-8. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.2005.05694.x.,,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', 'EC 3.5.1.1 (Asparaginase)', 'EC 6.3.1.1 (Aspartate-Ammonia Ligase)']",,"['BJH5694 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1365-2141.2005.05694.x [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The aim of the current study was to investigate the ability of the endogenous peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)gamma ligand 15-deoxy-Delta12,14-prostaglandin J2 (15d-PGJ2) to regulate expression of the human TP gene and to ascertain its potential effects on the individual TPalpha and TPbeta isoforms. 15d-PGJ2 suppressed Prm3 transcriptional activity and TPbeta mRNA expression in the platelet progenitor megakaryocytic human erythroleukemia (HEL) 92.1.7 cell line but had no effect on Prm1 or Prm2 activity or on TPalpha mRNA expression. 15d-PGJ2 also resulted in reductions in the overall level of TP protein expression and TP-mediated intracellular calcium mobilization in HEL cells. 15d-PGJ2 suppression of Prm3 transcriptional activity and TPbeta mRNA expression was found to occur through a novel mechanism involving direct binding of PPARgamma-retinoic acid X receptor (RXR) heterodimers to a PPARgamma response element (PPRE) composed of two imperfect hexameric direct repeat (DR) sequences centred at -159 and -148, respectively, spaced by five nucleotides (DR5). These data provide direct evidence for the role of PPARgamma in the regulation of human TP gene expression within the vasculature and point to further critical differences in the modes of transcriptional regulation of TPalpha and TPbeta in humans.

We analyzed the results of allogeneic HSCT in 38 children to determine which factors, if any, affected outcome. PROCEDURE: The effects of demographic, donor, and disease-related factors were analyzed to determine their effects on overall and disease-free survival (OS, DFS), relapse, and non-relapse mortality (NRM). RESULTS: OS and DFS for t-AML and t-MDS were similar. Three-year OS and EFS were the same (15.4 +/- 5.8%) and the 3-year NRM was 59.6 +/- 8.4%. The 1-year cumulative risk of grade III-IV acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) and relapse were 23.7 +/- 7.0% and 18.7 +/- 6.5%, respectively. The percentage of pre-transplant bone marrow (BM) blasts was positively associated with relapse (P = 0.05), while the percentage of BM blasts at diagnosis of therapy-related disease tended to associate with NRM (P = 0.07). Alternative donor and matched sibling donor grafts had similar outcomes.

This study examined the HRQOL of children scheduled for HPCT, the effects of diagnosis and age on HRQOL, and the convergent validity of one generic and two disease-specific measures of HRQOL. PROCEDURE: The sample consisted of 111 children (mean age = 10.4 years) diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL; 22%), other leukemias (26%), neuroblastoma (19%), other solid tumors (18%), and hematologic disorders (15%). Convergence validity was tested with 67 children (mean age = 10.3 years) who had an equivalent distribution of diagnoses except for neuroblastoma (12%). The Child Health Questionnaire (CHQ), a generic measure, and the Pediatric Oncology Quality of Life Scale (POQOL) and the Play Performance Scale (PPS), disease-specific measures, were completed by one parent prior to HPCT. RESULTS: Compared to the norms for healthy children, the CHQ Physical summary scores for every diagnostic subgroup and the CHQ Psychosocial summary scores for ALL were poorer. Compared to the cancer norms for Total POQOL and PPS scores, scores for ALL and neuroblastoma were the poorest. These measures also revealed that adolescents' HRQOL was perceived to be worse than children's. Total POQOL scores showed strong convergent validity with CHQ Physical and Psychosocial scores and moderate convergent validity with the PPS scores. CONCLUSIONS: Based on parental reports, children treated for ALL and neuroblastoma appear to be at the greatest risk for poor HRQOL before undergoing HPCT, and adolescents seem to be more compromised than younger children, based on parental reports. The POQOL measure seems to be the best predictor of HRQOL. These results have clinical implications for the care of children undergoing HPCT.","['Barrera, Maru', 'Gee, Carolyn', 'Andrews, Gail S', 'Armstrong, Christine A', 'Saunders, Fred E']","['Barrera M', 'Gee C', 'Andrews GS', 'Armstrong CA', 'Saunders FE']","['Department of Psychology, Program in Population Health Sciences, The Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, Ontario, Canada. maru.barrera@sickkids.ca']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Age Factors', '*Attitude to Health', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/*diagnosis/psychology/*therapy', 'Parents', '*Quality of Life', 'Surveys and Questionnaires']",2005/09/13 09:00,2007/01/11 09:00,['2005/09/13 09:00'],"['2005/09/13 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/01/11 09:00 [medline]', '2005/09/13 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2006 Sep;47(3):320-6. doi: 10.1002/pbc.20601.,,,,['10.1002/pbc.20601 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To determine if the spontaneous cell proliferation observed in the late disease stages, such as persistent lymphocytosis and lymphosarcoma, correlated with the expression level of TNF-alpha, we analyzed the mRNA expression levels for TNF-alpha in spontaneously proliferating PBMCs derived from BLV-infected cattle. The mean mRNA expression level for TNF-alpha was higher in the spontaneously proliferating PBMCs derived from BLV-infected cattle than in non-spontaneously proliferating PBMCs from normal cattle. The TNF-alpha protein level in the PBMCs was determined by flow cytometric analysis, and it was noted that most of the cells expressing membrane-bound TNF-alpha in the spontaneously proliferating cells were CD5+ or sIgM+-cells. Additionally, in order to determine if this spontaneous proliferation can be blocked by anti-bovine TNF-alpha MAb, the spontaneously proliferating PBMCs from a BLV-infected cattle were cultured in the presence of the MAb. The addition of this MAb at the beginning of the 72 h-cultivation clearly inhibited spontaneous proliferation of cells in a dose-dependent manner, indicating the direct involvement of TNF-alpha in the spontaneous proliferation of PBMCs during the late disease stage. These data suggest that an aberrant expression of TNF-alpha might contribute to the progression of bovine leukosis in animals which develop persistent lymphocytosis of B-cells or B-cell lymphosarcoma.","['Konnai, S', 'Usui, T', 'Ikeda, M', 'Kohara, J', 'Hirata, T', 'Okada, K', 'Ohashi, K', 'Onuma, M']","['Konnai S', 'Usui T', 'Ikeda M', 'Kohara J', 'Hirata T', 'Okada K', 'Ohashi K', 'Onuma M']","['Department of Disease Control, Graduate School of Veterinary Medicine, Hokkaido University, Sapporo, Hokkaido, Japan. konnai@vetmed.hokudai.ac.jp']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Austria,Arch Virol,Archives of virology,7506870,IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies', 'Cattle', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Enzootic Bovine Leukosis/*metabolism/*pathology', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation', '*Leukemia Virus, Bovine', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/*metabolism/*pathology', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor, Type II/metabolism', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/*metabolism', '*Up-Regulation', 'Viral Load']",2005/09/13 09:00,2006/03/30 09:00,['2005/09/13 09:00'],"['2005/03/31 00:00 [received]', '2005/05/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2005/09/13 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/03/30 09:00 [medline]', '2005/09/13 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Arch Virol. 2006 Feb;151(2):347-60. doi: 10.1007/s00705-005-0622-x.

The reasons for HTLV-I clustering, such as the high ubiquity in southwestern Japan but low prevalence in neighboring regions of Korea, China and eastern Russia are still unknown. The major modes of transmission are well understood, although better quantitative data on the incidence of transmission, and on promoting/inhibiting factors, are needed. Epidemiologic proof has been obtained for HTLV-I's causative role in major disease associations: adult T-cell leukemia (ATL), HTLV-associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis (HAM/TSP), HTLV-associated uveitis and infective dermatitis. However, more and better studies are needed for other apparent disease outcomes such as rheumatologic, psychiatric and infectious diseases.

Proliferation of infected cells is clonal and persistent in vivo. During the carrier state, infected cells are selected in vivo by the host's immune system, the genetic and epigenetic environment of proviral integration sites, and other factors. In leukemic cells, tax gene expression is frequently impaired by genetic and epigenetic mechanisms. Such loss of Tax expression enables ATL cells to escape the host immune system. On the other hand, ATL cells acquire the ability to proliferate without Tax by intracellular genetic and epigenetic changes. Despite advances in support and the development of novel treatment agents, the prognosis for ATLL remains poor. A number of therapies, however, do appear to improve prognosis compared to CHOP (VEPA). These include interferon-alpha plus zidovudine (probably after 1-2 cycles of CHOP), intensive chemotherapy as in LSG-15 with G-CSF support and Allo-SCT (which includes the potential for cure). Emerging novel approaches include HDAC inhibitors, monoclonal antibodies, and proteasome inhibitors. Comparison between different therapeutic approaches is complicated by the range of natural history of ATLL, different recruitments of naive-to-therapy, refractory or relapsed patients, and variations in the reporting of outcome that frequently excludes difficult-to-evaluate patients. Moreover, results from relatively small proof-of-principle studies have not been extended with randomized, controlled trials. As a result, currently, there is no clear evidence to support the value of any particular treatment approach over others. To avoid further unnecessary patient suffering and to identify optimal therapy as rapidly as possible, large randomized, controlled trials encompassing multicenter, international collaborations will be necessary.","['Taylor, Graham P', 'Matsuoka, Masao']","['Taylor GP', 'Matsuoka M']","['Department of GU Medicine & Communicable Diseases, Faculty of Medicine, Imperial College, Norfolk Place, London W2 1PG, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,IM,"['Adult', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Genes, pX', 'Genome, Viral', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/genetics/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/drug therapy/immunology/*physiopathology/*therapy', 'Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Virus Replication']",2005/09/13 09:00,2005/10/05 09:00,['2005/09/13 09:00'],"['2005/09/13 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/10/05 09:00 [medline]', '2005/09/13 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2005 Sep 5;24(39):6047-57. doi: 10.1038/sj.onc.1208979.,,,103,"['1208979 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.onc.1208979 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The study of HTLV also represents an attractive model that has allowed investigators to dissect the mechanism of various cellular processes, several of which may be critical steps in HTLV-mediated pathogenesis. Both HTLV-1 and HTLV-2 can efficiently immortalize and transform T lymphocytes in cell culture and persist in infected individuals or experimental animals. However, the clinical manifestations of these two viruses differ significantly. HTLV-1 is associated with adult T-cell leukemia (ATL) and a variety of immune-mediated disorders including the chronic neurological disease termed HTLV-1-associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis (HAM/TSP). In contrast, HTLV-2 is much less pathogenic with reports of only a few cases of variant hairy cell leukemia and neurological disease associated with infection. The limited number of individuals shown to harbor HTLV-2 in association with specific diseases has, to date, precluded convincing epidemiological demonstration of a definitive etiologic role of HTLV-2 in human disease. Therefore, it has become clear that comparative studies designed to elucidate the mechanisms by which HTLV-1 and HTLV-2 determine distinct outcomes are likely to provide fundamental insights into the initiation of multistep leukemogenesis.","['Feuer, Gerold', 'Green, Patrick L']","['Feuer G', 'Green PL']","['Department of Microbiology and Immunology, SUNY Upstate Medical University, Syracuse, New York 13210, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Cycle/genetics', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'Gene Products, tax/metabolism', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/pathogenicity/*physiology', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 2/pathogenicity/*physiology', 'Humans', 'NF-kappa B/metabolism', 'T-Lymphocytes/virology']",2005/09/13 09:00,2005/10/05 09:00,['2005/09/13 09:00'],"['2005/09/13 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/10/05 09:00 [medline]', '2005/09/13 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2005 Sep 5;24(39):5996-6004. doi: 10.1038/sj.onc.1208971.,"['P01 CA100730/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA100730-02/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA100730-069003/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA100730/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (NF-kappa B)']",137,"['1208971 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.onc.1208971 [doi]']",,,,,PMC2659530,,,,,,,,,['NIHMS94142'],,

Fewer than one in 20 infected individuals typically develop ATL and the onset of this cancer occurs after decades of relatively symptom-free infection. Leukemic cells from ATL patients display extensive and varied forms of chromosomal abnormalities and this genomic instability is thought to be a major contributor to the development of ATL. HTLV-I encodes a regulatory protein, Tax, which is necessary and sufficient to transform cells and is therefore considered to be the viral oncoprotein. Tax interacts with numerous cellular proteins to reprogram cellular processes including, but not limited to, transcription, cell cycle regulation, DNA repair, and apoptosis. This review presents an overview of the impact of HTLV-I infection in general, and Tax expression in particular, on cell cycle progression and the repair of DNA damage.

In normal T cells, NF-kappaB activation occurs transiently in response to immune stimuli, which is required for antigen-stimulated T-cell proliferation and survival. However, HTLV-I induces persistent activation of NF-kappaB, causing deregulated expression of a large array of cellular genes, which in turn contributes to the induction of T-cell transformation. The HTLV-I transforming protein Tax functions as an intracellular stimulator of IkappaB kinase (IKK), a cellular kinase mediating NF-kappaB activation by diverse stimuli. Tax physically interacts with IKK and renders this inducible kinase constitutively active. By assembling different Tax/IKK complexes, Tax targets the persistent activation of both canonical and noncanonical NF-kappaB signaling pathways. Whereas Tax plays a primary role in HTLV-I-mediated NF-kappaB activation, recent studies reveal that the IKK/NF-kappaB signaling pathway is also activated in freshly isolated adult T-cell leukemia (ATL) cells that often lack detectable Tax expression. The mechanism underlying this Tax-independent pathway of NF-kappaB activation remains poorly understood. Clarifying the precise nature and consequences of the constitutive NF-kappaB activation in ATL cells is important for developing rational therapeutic strategies for this T-cell malignancy.","['Sun, Shao-Cong', 'Yamaoka, Shoji']","['Sun SC', 'Yamaoka S']","['Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Pennsylvania State University College of Medicine, 500 University Dr., Hershey, PA 17033, USA. sxs70@psu.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,IM,"['Animals', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/therapy/virology', 'NF-kappa B/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'T-Lymphocytes/metabolism/virology']",2005/09/13 09:00,2005/10/05 09:00,['2005/09/13 09:00'],"['2005/09/13 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/10/05 09:00 [medline]', '2005/09/13 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2005 Sep 5;24(39):5952-64. doi: 10.1038/sj.onc.1208969.,"['CA094922/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA68471/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",['0 (NF-kappa B)'],189,"['1208969 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.onc.1208969 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Tax, encoded by the HTLV-1 pX region, has been recognized by its pleiotropic actions to play a critical role in leukemogenesis. Three highly conserved 21-bp repeat elements located within the long terminal repeat, commonly referred to as Tax-responsive element 1 (TRE-1), are critical to Tax-mediated viral transcriptional activation through complex interaction with cyclic AMP-responsive element binding protein (CREB), CBP/p300 and PCAF. Tax has also been shown to activate transcription from a number of critical cellular genes through the NF-kappaB and serum-responsive factor pathways. Tax transactivation has been attributed to the protein's interaction with transcription factors, chromatin remodeling complexes, cell cycle and repair genes. In this review, we will discuss some of the latest findings on this fascinating viral activator and highlight its regulation of cellular factors including CREB, p300/CBP and their effect on RNA polymerase II and chromatin remodeling, as well as its role in cytoplasmic and nuclear function. We will highlight the possible contribution of each factor, discuss Tax's critical peptide domains and highlight its post-transcriptional modifications. It is quite obvious that, collectively, Tax's effects on a wide variety of cellular targets cooperate in promoting cell proliferation and leukemogenesis. In addition, the post-transcriptional effects of Rex play an important role in virus replication. Understanding these interactions at a molecular level will facilitate the targeted development of drugs to effectively inhibit or treat ATL.","['Kashanchi, Fatah', 'Brady, John N']","['Kashanchi F', 'Brady JN']","['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, The George Washington University School of Medicine, 2300 Eye St, NW, Ross Hall, Washington, DC, USA. bcmfxk@gwumc.eduz']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,IM,"['Gene Expression Regulation, Viral', 'Gene Products, rex/genetics', 'Gene Products, tax/genetics', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*genetics', '*RNA Processing, Post-Transcriptional', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'RNA, Viral/genetics', '*Transcription, Genetic', 'Viral Proteins/genetics']",2005/09/13 09:00,2005/10/05 09:00,['2005/09/13 09:00'],"['2005/09/13 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/10/05 09:00 [medline]', '2005/09/13 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2005 Sep 5;24(39):5938-51. doi: 10.1038/sj.onc.1208973.,"['13969/PHS HHS/United States', 'AI43894/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'AI44357/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States']","['0 (Gene Products, rex)', '0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Viral)', '0 (Viral Proteins)']",157,"['1208973 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.onc.1208973 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Models provided maximum likelihood estimates of the relative rate for the contrast between categories of one agent, adjusting for other agents and for additional potential confounders. RESULTS: Cumulative exposure to 1,3-butadiene was associated positively with all leukemia (relative rates of 1.0, 1.4, 1.2, 2.9, and 3.7, respectively, for exposures of 0, >0 to <33.7, 33.7 to <184.7, 184.7 to <425.0, and 425.0+ ppm-years), chronic myelogenous leukemia and to a lesser extent with chronic lymphocytic leukemia.

Stem-cell transplantation and the use of interferon alfa had already offered the possibility of complete and durable cytogenetic responses, improving the survival over that expected with conventional chemotherapy. The introduction of imatinib mesylate has started the era of molecular therapy with remarkable results including complete cytogenetic responses in up to 90% of patients and major molecular responses in most. However, some patients, particularly those treated in the advanced stages, may develop resistance to imatinib. Thus there has been interest in developing new agents that would not only help patients for whom imatinib is ineffective or intolerable, but that could also be combined with the intention of eliminating all evidence of disease. Several approaches are being pursued. These include new and more potent tyrosine kinase inhibitors that may not be affected by the most common mutations seen in the clinic. Some of these agents also inhibit Src-related kinases that may play a role in the development of resistance to imatinib. Other agents are directed at downstream or alternative pathways in leukemic cells, exploring potential synergy with imatinib. Another approach is to pursue an immune modulation that might eliminate small amounts of residual disease. Many of these agents are already showing promising results in the clinic. This manuscript reviews some of these agents, particularly those for which clinical data are already available.","['Cortes, Jorge', 'Kantarjian, Hagop']","['Cortes J', 'Kantarjian H']","['Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, 1515 Holcombe Blvd, Unit 428, Houston, TX 77030, USA. jcortes@mdanderson.org']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,IM,"['Benzamides', 'Cancer Vaccines/administration & dosage', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Administration Schedule', '*Drug Delivery Systems', 'Drug Therapy, Combination', 'Female', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*methods', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Interferon-alpha/*administration & dosage', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/diagnosis/*mortality/*therapy', 'Male', 'Piperazines/*administration & dosage', 'Prognosis', 'Pyrimidines/*administration & dosage', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Severity of Illness Index', 'Survival Analysis']",2005/09/13 09:00,2005/10/28 09:00,['2005/09/13 09:00'],"['2005/09/13 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/10/28 09:00 [medline]', '2005/09/13 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2005 Sep 10;23(26):6316-24. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2005.05.009.,,"['0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Cancer Vaccines)', '0 (Interferon-alpha)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)']",101,"['23/26/6316 [pii]', '10.1200/JCO.2005.05.009 [doi]']",,,,,,['J Clin Oncol. 2005 Dec 10;23(35):9034'],,,,,,,,,,

In this review, we summarize the findings of these investigations and highlight how this information is being integrated into multistep mutagenesis cascades that impact specific signal transduction pathways and synergistically lead to leukemic transformation. Because of these advances, fueled by improved technology for mutational analysis and the development of small-molecule drugs and monoclonal antibodies, the future is bright for a new generation of targeted therapies.

The WHO has recognized this new information by incorporating into its classification morphologic, immunophenotypic, genetic, and clinical features in an attempt to define biologically and clinically relevant entities. Nevertheless, well-defined cytogenetic subgroups exhibit considerable heterogeneity, and in many AML subtypes the pathogenic event is still not known. A classification system based on the underlying molecular pathogenetic abnormalities would be ideal, but such detailed knowledge is not yet available. Novel approaches in genomics, such as surveying the expression levels of thousands of genes in parallel using DNA microarray technology, open possibilities to further refine the studies on AML. Today, gene expression profiling in AML is becoming well established and has already been proven to be valuable in diagnosing different cytogenetic subtypes, discovering novel AML subclasses, and predicting clinical outcome. Recently, gene expression profiling studies in AML showed a remarkable level of concordance in findings, which may ultimately lead to an increasingly refined molecular taxonomy. While many challenges remain to be overcome, a combination of gene expression profiling with other microarray-based applications, high-throughput mutational analyses and proteomic approaches will not only significantly contribute to the classification and therapeutic decision making of AML, but also give important insights into the true pathobiologic nature of this type of leukemia.","['Bullinger, Lars', 'Valk, Peter J M']","['Bullinger L', 'Valk PJ']","['Department of Internal Medicine III, University of Ulm, Robert-Koch-Str 8, D-89081 Ulm, Germany. lars.bullinger@medizin.uni-ulm.de']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,IM,"['Cytogenetic Analysis', 'Female', '*Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease/*epidemiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/epidemiology/*genetics', 'Male', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Prognosis', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Severity of Illness Index']",2005/09/13 09:00,2005/10/28 09:00,['2005/09/13 09:00'],"['2005/09/13 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/10/28 09:00 [medline]', '2005/09/13 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2005 Sep 10;23(26):6296-305. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2005.05.020.,,,74,"['23/26/6296 [pii]', '10.1200/JCO.2005.05.020 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A report of the Childhood Cancer Registry of Piedmont.",1197-204,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Several studies have been published on trends in childhood cancer incidence, with different patterns being reported. We present an analysis of cancer incidence trends in Piedmont (Italy) in 1967-2001 for the major categories of childhood malignant neoplasms. DESIGN AND METHODS: The population-based Childhood Cancer Registry of Piedmont has recorded incident cases of malignant neoplasm in children (age 0-14) since 1967. Procedures for data collection and coding have been uniform throughout the study period. We calculated incidence rates per million children per year by sex and age-group. Trends were estimated using Poisson regression analysis, adjusted for age and sex and presented as the annual percent change (APC). RESULTS: Significant increases were observed for all malignant neoplasms combined (3360 cases, APC:1.3%, 95% CI:1.0% to 1.6%), leukemia (APC: 1.0%, 95% CI: 0.4% to 1.6%), central nervous system (CNS) tumors (APC of 2.3%, 95% CI: 1.6% to 3.1%) and neuroblastoma (APC: 2.3%, 95% CI: 1.0% to 3.5%). Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (APC 1.2%, 95% CI: 0.2% to 2.3%), and Acute non-lymphoblastic leukemia (APC 1.7%, 95% CI-0.6%, 4.1) both increased over time. Differences by age groups were observed for some tumor types, such as for neuroblastoma in infants (4.8% increase per year), leukemia in children aged 1-4 years (1.2%) and CNS tumors in children aged 10-14 (3.4%).

The AIEOP ALL-9501 study.,1186-91,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Treatment of childhood standard-risk (SR) acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is generally successful. However, intensive chemotherapy regimens may be associated with severe treatment sequelae. Efforts are therefore being made to identify those patients in whom less intensive treatment would be equally successful but cause fewer long-term sequelae. The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of treatment reduction in a subset of children with ALL at minimal risk of failure. DESIGN AND METHODS: The population of patients with SR ALL included children aged between 1 and 6 years with less than 20,000 WBC/mm3, non-T immunophenotype, DNA index between 1.16 and 1.6, absence of t(9;22) and t(4;11) clonal translocations, no extramedullary leukemia, good response to prednisone and complete remission (CR) at the end of induction therapy. A reduced-intensity, BFM-type treatment schedule (AIEOP-ALL 9501 protocol) was used. Induction therapy was based on vincristine, prednisone, L-asparaginase and intrathecal methotrexate only; high-dose-methotrexate (2 g/m2) was given x4. The BFM Protocol II was given as reinduction therapy; thus the total dose of anthracyclines was 120 mg/m2 and no epipodophyllotoxins or cranial irradiation were employed. RESULTS: Between May 1995 and December 1999, 123 patients were identified as having SR-ALL (7.8% of the ALL-95 population), of whom 102 received the SR protocol. After a median follow-up of 5.9 years, 11 patients in the SR protocol had relapsed, 1 had died in remission, and 1 had developed a second malignant neoplasm. The probabilities (standard errors) of survival and event-free survival (EFS) were, respectively, 97.0% (1.7) and 86.7% (3.5) at 5 years, and 95.3% (2.4) and 86.7% (3.5) at 7 years. INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: Although most of the relapsed patients were rescued, the long-term EFS probability in this small, highly selected group of patients remains inferior to expectation. Thus, alternative selection criteria, such as treatment response measured by minimal residual disease, should be considered to address the issue of treatment reduction.","['Arico, Maurizio', 'Conter, Valentino', 'Valsecchi, Maria Grazia', 'Rizzari, Carmelo', 'Boccalatte, Marie France Pinta', 'Barisone, Elena', 'Messina, Chiara', 'De Rossi, Giulio', 'Lo Nigro, Luca', 'Pession, Andrea', 'Locatelli, Franco', 'Micalizzi, Concetta', 'Basso, Giuseppe']","['Arico M', 'Conter V', 'Valsecchi MG', 'Rizzari C', 'Boccalatte MF', 'Barisone E', 'Messina C', 'De Rossi G', 'Lo Nigro L', 'Pession A', 'Locatelli F', 'Micalizzi C', 'Basso G']","['Oncoematologia Pediatrica, Ospedale dei Bambini G.

Detailed karyotyping can be further hampered by the presence of multiple rearrangements. Our objective was to search for cryptic rearrangements in childhood ALL. DESIGN AND METHODS: A series of eight cases of childhood ALL with at least two structural defects were selected and studied by multiple color fluorescent in situ hybridization (M-FISH). RESULTS: Four previously not reported translocations were detected: a t(14;20) (q32;q11.2) in a 3-year old girl with T-ALL, a cryptic t(7;11)(q35;q24) in association with a t(1;14)(p32;q32) in a patient with T-ALL and two translocations possibly involving the same 6q26 region on the distal end of the long arm of chromosome 6. Further FISH analysis on the t(7;11) indicated rearrangement of the TCRB locus at 7q35 suggesting that this t(7;11) leads to overexpression of an as yet unidentified gene at 11q24. This observation also triggered further screening for TCRB rearrangements in T-ALL. FISH analysis of the t(14;20) with an IGH locus-specific probe provided evidence for an unusual rearrangement of the IGH gene, in the variable gene segment region. Finally, we also observed cryptic insertions of AF4 and ETV6 in combination with complex rearrangements, leading to MLL/AF4 and ETV6/RUNX1 gene fusions. INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: This study underscores the importance and power of M-FISH analysis in unraveling complex karyotypes and identifying cryptic chromosomal rearrangements. It also sheds some light on the implication of cryptic TCRB rearrangements in T-ALL.","['Poppe, Bruce', 'Cauwelier, Barbara', 'Van Limbergen, Heidi', 'Yigit, Nurten', 'Philippe, Jan', 'Verhasselt, Bruno', 'De Paepe, Anne', 'Benoit, Yves', 'Speleman, Frank']","['Poppe B', 'Cauwelier B', 'Van Limbergen H', 'Yigit N', 'Philippe J', 'Verhasselt B', 'De Paepe A', 'Benoit Y', 'Speleman F']","['Center for Medical Genetics, University Hospital Ghent, De Pintelaan 185, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence/*methods', 'Karyotyping/methods', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics', 'Translocation, Genetic/*genetics']",2005/09/13 09:00,2006/08/19 09:00,['2005/09/13 09:00'],"['2005/09/13 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/08/19 09:00 [medline]', '2005/09/13 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2005 Sep;90(9):1179-85.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the area of new drug development, a recurrent theme was receptor tyrosine kinase (TK) inhibitors, with multi-targeted, small molecule inhibitors - highly potent against a family of receptors such as vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR), platelet-derived growth factor (PDGFR) and the receptor tyrosine kinase KIT - taking centre stage. Several agents interfering with intracellular targets that are components of key oncogenic signaling pathways, such as RAF kinase, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt or Src, are in preclinical and early clinical development. ""Addictive"" targets, such as the Bcr-Abl fusion protein in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), are critical for maintaining the malignant phenotype and hence represent an Achilles' heel for selective drugs. Significantly, novel targeted therapeutics currently in clinical development do not generally lead to cures or long-term survival for most intractable cancers; resistance may eventually develop. Anti-metastatic agents and anti-adhesion drugs, which collectively act on tumor cell-stroma interactions (anti-stromal therapy), are also actively pursued. In addition, forms of cell death other than apoptosis - cellular senescence, cancer cell-specific cell-cycle processes and the hypoxic environment - are being explored in order to identify novel targets for more selective therapy. This report also highlights developments aimed at more safe and effective drug combinations. Evaluating drug combinations, and elucidating the rationale for combinations of old (cytotoxic) and new (biological) anticancer agents, are promising research areas and taxane-based combinations are presented as examples. The report is based on presentations at AACR 2005 and related publications of the first half of 2005.","['Broxterman, Henk J', 'Georgopapadakou, Nafsika H']","['Broxterman HJ', 'Georgopapadakou NH']","['Department Of Medical Oncology, Vrije Universiteit Medical Center, De Boelelaan 1117, 1081 HV Amsterdam, The Netherlands.

The curative potential of current standard treatment continues to be unsatisfactory, despite multimodal approaches involving surgery, chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Novel therapeutics including small molecules and monoclonal antibodies are being developed and have been partially introduced into clinical use in connection with neoplastic diseases such as chronic myeloid leukemia, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and colorectal cancer. Thorough understanding of the changes in gene expression occurring during gastric carcinogenesis may help to develop targeted therapies and improve the treatment of this disease.

Virus replicated more rapidly at lower FBS concentrations (0 or 2%) than at higher concentrations (10 or 20%) during an early stage of infection. Basal and interferon (IFN)-induced levels of typical IFN-inducible anti-viral proteins, such as 2',5'-oligoadenylate synthetase, dsRNA-activated protein kinase and MxA, were unaffected by variation in FBS concentrations. But promyelocytic leukemia protein (PML) was expressed in a serum-dependent manner. In particular, the 65 to 70 kDa isoform of PML was markedly upregulated following the addition of serum. In contrast, other isoforms were induced by IFN treatment, and weakly induced by FBS concentrations. Immunofluorescence microscopy indicated that PML was mainly formed nuclear bodies in Caco-2 cells at various FBS concentrations, and the levels of the PML-nuclear bodies were upregulated by FBS. Overexpression of PML isoform consisting of 560 or 633 amino acid residues by transfection of expression plasmid results in significantly delayed viral replication rate in Caco-2 cells. On the other hand, downregulation of PML expression by RNAi enhanced viral replication. These results indicate that PML isoforms which are expressed in a serum-dependent manner suppress the propagation of influenza virus at an early stage of infection.","['Iki, Shigeo', 'Yokota, Shin-ichi', 'Okabayashi, Tamaki', 'Yokosawa, Noriko', 'Nagata, Kyosuke', 'Fujii, Nobuhiro']","['Iki S', 'Yokota S', 'Okabayashi T', 'Yokosawa N', 'Nagata K', 'Fujii N']","['Department of Microbiology, Sapporo Medical University School of Medicine, and Hokkaido Institute of Public Health, Kita-ku, Sapporo 060-0819, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Virology,Virology,0110674,IM,"[""2',5'-Oligoadenylate Synthetase/analysis"", 'Blotting, Western', 'Caco-2 Cells', 'Cell Nucleus/chemistry', 'Culture Media/chemistry', 'GTP-Binding Proteins/analysis', 'Gene Dosage', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Silencing', 'Humans', 'Influenza A virus/*physiology', 'Interferons/analysis', 'Microscopy, Fluorescence', 'Molecular Weight', 'Myxovirus Resistance Proteins', 'Neoplasm Proteins/analysis/*physiology', 'Nuclear Proteins/analysis/*physiology', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'Protein Isoforms', 'RNA Interference', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Serum', 'Transcription Factors/analysis/*physiology', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/analysis/*physiology', 'Viral Plaque Assay', '*Virus Replication', 'eIF-2 Kinase/analysis']",2005/09/13 09:00,2006/01/20 09:00,['2005/09/13 09:00'],"['2005/05/26 00:00 [received]', '2005/06/23 00:00 [revised]', '2005/08/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2005/09/13 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/01/20 09:00 [medline]', '2005/09/13 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Virology. 2005 Dec 5;343(1):106-15. doi: 10.1016/j.virol.2005.08.010.

The clastogen benzene and several of its toxic metabolites have been shown to cause cancer in animals. Benzene is associated with leukemia and other blood related disorders in humans. Benzene and metabolites tested negative in short-term bacterial mutation assays such as the Salmonella Mutagenicity Test and the Escherichia coli Tryptophan Reversion Assay. These assays, while reliable for the detection of point-mutagenic carcinogens, are incapable of detecting DNA strand break inducing xenobiotics. The yeast DEL assay is based on intrachromosomal recombination events resulting in deletions and is very sensitive in detecting DNA strand breaks. In previous results the DEL assay detected 17 Salmonella positive as well as 25 Salmonella negative carcinogens [Bishop, Schiestl, Hum. Mol. Genet. 9 (2000) 2427-2434]. The carcinogen benzene and its metabolites including phenol, catechol, p-benzoquinone and hydroquinone induced DEL recombination. The benzene metabolite 1,2,4-benzenetriol was negative. Interestingly, p-benzoquinone induced DEL recombination at a dose 300-fold lower than any of the other metabolites, suggesting that it might be responsible for much of benzene's genotoxicity. In addition, an excision repair deficient strain was used, but no difference was detected compared to the wildtype, indicating that DNA adducts subject to excision repair were not formed by benzene or its metabolites.","['Sommers, Christopher H', 'Schiestl, Robert H']","['Sommers CH', 'Schiestl RH']","['Radiation Biology Unit, Division of Food Safety, USDA, ARS, ERRC, 600 E, Mermaid Lane, Wyndmoor, PA 19038, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Mutat Res,Mutation research,0400763,IM,"['Benzene/*toxicity', '*Chromosomes, Fungal', 'DNA, Fungal/drug effects', 'Mutagens/*toxicity', 'Recombination, Genetic/*drug effects', 'Saccharomyces cerevisiae/*drug effects/genetics']",2005/09/13 09:00,2006/03/29 09:00,['2005/09/13 09:00'],"['2005/04/12 00:00 [received]', '2005/06/06 00:00 [revised]', '2005/06/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2005/09/13 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/03/29 09:00 [medline]', '2005/09/13 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Mutat Res. 2006 Jan 29;593(1-2):1-8. doi: 10.1016/j.mrfmmm.2005.06.026.

The best known example is the treatment of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) with Gleevec. This is a small molecule inhibitor of the Bcr-Abl kinase which has been shown to drive the initiation and progression of CML. While treatment of early stage CML with Gleevec has been quite successful, later stages of the disease (blast crisis) are not successfully treated due to the emergence of drug resistant cells. It is therefore important to understand the principles according to which drug resistant cells evolve, so that we can design treatment strategies which aim to prevent the rise of resistant cells. Such evolutionary dynamics can be studied with mathematical models, and this article reviews such an approach.

(ii) How does the turnover rate of cancer cells influence the evolution of drug resistant cells? (iii) Can combination therapy be used to prevent drug resistance?

In order to be used in high-throughput analyses technical details have to be standardized to improve reproducibility and comparability of quantitative results obtained in different laboratories. METHODS: Molecular monitoring of disease activity during and after treatment based on the detection of malignant cells in circulation or bone marrow by quantitative real-time PCR will be helpful to develop individualized treatment strategies for every patient. CONCLUSIONS: The effectiveness of any kind of innovative treatment with specific antibodies, cellular immunotherapy or molecules designed for specific targets of tumor cells can be controlled at a very high level of sensitivity and accuracy. Based on quantitative results indicative for success or treatment failure, therapeutic changes upon the detection of progressive disease at the molecular level can be made even before symptoms or signs of clinical relapse occur. Hopefully, this will lead to higher cure rates and improved long-term survival.","['Schuler, Frank', 'Dolken, Gottfried']","['Schuler F', 'Dolken G']","['Clinic for Internal Medicine C, Hematology/Oncology, Ernst-Moritz-Arndt-University Greifswald, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Netherlands,Clin Chim Acta,Clinica chimica acta; international journal of clinical chemistry,1302422,IM,"['Biomarkers, Tumor/analysis', 'Blood Circulation', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/diagnosis/genetics', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/diagnosis/genetics', 'Lymphoma/diagnosis/genetics', 'Neoplasm, Residual/*diagnosis/genetics', 'Philadelphia Chromosome', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction/*methods', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/diagnosis/genetics', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2005/09/13 09:00,2006/03/03 09:00,['2005/09/13 09:00'],"['2005/05/05 00:00 [received]', '2005/05/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2005/09/13 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/03/03 09:00 [medline]', '2005/09/13 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Clin Chim Acta. 2006 Jan;363(1-2):147-56. doi: 10.1016/j.cccn.2005.05.045.

Using acetylation-defective and acetylation-mimicking mutants, we demonstrate that acetylation targets FoxO1 to Pml and prevents ubiquitin-dependent degradation.

Recently, significantly higher frequencies of heterozygous carriers of the Slavic founder NBS1 mutation, 657del5, were found in Russian children with sporadic lymphoid malignancies, and in Polish adults with non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL). In addition, the substitution 643C>T (R215W) has also been found in excess among children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). In an attempt to asses the contribution of both mutations to the development of sporadic lymphoid malignancies, we analyzed DNA samples from a large group of Polish pediatric patients. The NBS1 mutation 657del5 on one allele was found in 3 of 270 patients with ALL and 2 of 212 children and adolescents with NHL; no carrier was found among 63 patients with Hodgkin lymphoma (HL). No carriers of the variant R215W were detected in any studied group. The relative frequency of the 657del5 mutation was calculated from a total of 6,984 controls matched by place of patient residence, of whom 42 were found to be carriers (frequency = 0.006). In the analyzed population with malignancies, an increased odds ratio for the occurrence of mutation 657del5 was found in comparison with the control Polish population (OR range 1.48-1.85, 95% confidence interval 1.18-2.65). This finding indicates that the frequency of the mutation carriers was indeed increased in patients with ALL and NHL (p < 0.05).

Anthracyclines represent the greatest risk. Biochemical markers of structural and functional myocardial damage have been gaining ground in cardiotoxicity monitoring. The aim of the study was to monitor cardiotoxicity of induction chemotherapy in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients and to assess the potential for use of biochemical markers in early diagnostics of cardiotoxicity. Fifteen consecutive adult patients with a newly diagnosed AML were studied. All patients received induction chemotherapy containing Idarubicin (IDA) 3 x 12 mg/m2 and intermediate doses of Cytarabine (8 x 1.5 g/m2). Serial measurements of plasma N-terminal pro brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) values were performed at the baseline, the day following each IDA infusion, after 14 days and after circa 1 month, i.e. before the next chemotherapy. Cardio-specific markers (cTnT, CK-MB mass) were measured at the baseline and after the last IDA infusion. The mean baseline value of NT-proBNP in newly diagnosed AML patients was 129.7+/-59.6 pg/ml. The mean NT-proBNP value increased after the first IDA infusion to 307.3+/-171.4 pg/ml (p=0.02). In most of the patients, the second and the third IDA infusions were not associated with a further increase in the NT-proBNP value and levels after 2 and 4 weeks were not significantly different from the baseline. However, in one of the patients the NT-proBNP values were increasing after each IDA infusion (after the last one 786.2 pg/ml) and within 14 days he developed congestive heart failure due to left ventricular diastolic dysfunction as assessed by echocardiography. At that time, the NT-proBNP value was 1,184.0 pg/ml; after diuretics it decreased significantly. In all patients, plasma cTnT and CK-MB mass concentrations were within the reference interval at the baseline and after the induction chemotherapy.

Comparison of symptomatic, palliative, and aggressive therapy.",411-4,"State-of-art of aggressive treatment of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in patients older than 60 years is one of the least satisfactory topics of present-day hematology. This fact led us to ask the following questions: Does it make sense to administer aggressive treatment to older patients with AML? Could it be that we only complicate the rest of the life of these older patients with AML, by using aggressive treatment? Would they not benefit more from palliative or symptomatic therapy? What is the quality of life of older patients with AML like? Therefore, to try to answer these questions, we performed the next analysis. A retrospective analysis was performed including (without any selection) all consecutive patients over 60 years of age who were treated with AML in our centre from 1998 till 2003. We have analyzed data from 137 elderly patients who were diagnosed with AML (excluding acute promyelocytic leukemia). Median survival from diagnosis in the aggressive (curative) therapy group was 4 months, in palliative therapy group 2 months and in symptomatic therapy group 0.8 months. Patients receiving curative therapy spent in a hospital (in-patient stay) 70% (median) of their life after diagnosis of AML, patients receiving palliative treatment 64% (median) of their life after diagnosis, and patients receiving symptomatic treatment 100% (median), respectively. Only marginal advantage in the median overall survival is observed in the group of aggressively treated patients.","['Doubek, M', 'Palasek, I', 'Brychtova, Y', 'Buchtova, I', 'Mayer, J']","['Doubek M', 'Palasek I', 'Brychtova Y', 'Buchtova I', 'Mayer J']","['Department of Internal Medicine - Hematooncology, University Hospital, 625 00 Brno, Czech Republic. mdoubek@fnbrno.cz']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",Slovakia,Neoplasma,Neoplasma,0377266,IM,"['Acute Disease/therapy', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage', 'Daunorubicin/administration & dosage', 'Female', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Hospitalization', 'Humans', 'Hydroxyurea/therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*mortality/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mitoxantrone/administration & dosage', '*Palliative Care', 'Prognosis', 'Remission Induction', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Analysis', 'Treatment Outcome']",2005/09/10 09:00,2005/12/15 09:00,['2005/09/10 09:00'],"['2005/09/10 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/12/15 09:00 [medline]', '2005/09/10 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Neoplasma. 2005;52(5):411-4.,,"['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', 'BZ114NVM5P (Mitoxantrone)', 'X6Q56QN5QC (Hydroxyurea)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

One hundred patients received a potential curative intensive chemotherapy (81%), of whom 28 received an allogeneic HSCT at some point of their treatment course, 17 patients (14%) received palliative therapies and 7 patients (5%) received supportive care only. In patients that received potential curative therapies LDH >or=2000 U/l, WBC >50 GPT/l, CD34 surface expression on the AML blasts, secondary AML, unfavorable karyotype and no allogeneic HSCT at some point of treatment course were associated with unfavorable prognosis. However, in the multivariate risk factor analyses only unfavorable karyotype (p=0.012), CD34 positivity of AML blasts (p=0.046), no allogeneic HSCT (p=0.008) and first diagnosis after 1997 (p=0.025) were independent unfavourable prognostic factors.

The cytotoxic effects 4'-DM-6-Mptox were assessed by the MTT-dye reduction assay against the human leukemic cell lines HL-60, BV-173 and LAMA-84. DNA-fragmentation analysis and NF-kB inhibition assay were performed in order to elucidate some of the mechanistic aspects of the cytotoxic action of the investigated compound. 4'-DM-6-Mptox was found to exert prominent cytotoxicity, with IC50 values being several-fold lower than those of the referent antineoplastic agent etoposide. The DNA-fragmentation analysis revealed that 4'-DM-6-Mptox treatment triggered apoptosis in BV-173 and HL-60 cells. In our hands 4'-DM-6-Mptox was found to induce concentration-dependent NF-kB inhibition in HeLa cells as assessed by the IL-6 luciferase gene reporter assay, which though not quite prominent, at least partly contributes to the cytotoxic potential of the tested lignan. On the basis of the results obtained it could be concluded that 4'-DM-6-Mptox necessitates further pharmacological and toxicological evaluation as a possible chemotherapeutic agent. Furthermore due to its relatively high concentrations in the described plant source the possibility for its use as a precursor for the semisynthetic production of lignan-based drugs, could be considered.","['Vasilev, N', 'Momekov, G', 'Zaharieva, M', 'Konstantinov, S', 'Bremner, P', 'Heinrich, M', 'Ionkova, I']","['Vasilev N', 'Momekov G', 'Zaharieva M', 'Konstantinov S', 'Bremner P', 'Heinrich M', 'Ionkova I']","['Laboratory of Biotechnology, Department of Pharmacognosy and Botany, Faculty of Pharmacy, Medical University Sofia, 1000 Sofia, Bulgaria. tsj@tu-sofia.bg']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Slovakia,Neoplasma,Neoplasma,0377266,IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/*pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'DNA Fragmentation/drug effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Flax/*chemistry', 'HL-60 Cells', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy', 'NF-kappa B/drug effects/metabolism', 'Plant Preparations/*pharmacology', 'Podophyllotoxin/*pharmacology']",2005/09/10 09:00,2005/12/15 09:00,['2005/09/10 09:00'],"['2005/09/10 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/12/15 09:00 [medline]', '2005/09/10 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Neoplasma. 2005;52(5):425-9.,,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Plant Preparations)', 'L36H50F353 (Podophyllotoxin)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

LY293111 (2-[2-propyl-3-[3-[2-ethyl-4-(4-fluorophenyl)-5-hydroxyphenoxy]-propoxy]-phenoxy] benzoic acid sodium salt) is a leukotriene B4 receptor antagonist, which was found to be safe and tolerable in Phase I clinical trials. In this study, we investigated the potential therapeutic effects and mechanisms of action of LY293111 in ALCL cell lines. LY293111 inhibited proliferation of both ALK(+) and ALK(-) ALCL cell in a dose-dependent fashion and induced complete G(1)-S cell cycle arrest, which was accompanied by upregulation of p27 and downregulation of cyclin E. Pretreatment with LY293111 for 4 h resulted in profound inhibition of serum-induced phosphorylation of extracellular-regulated kinases-1 and 2 and Akt and a concomitant increase in the phosphorylation of the stress-activated kinase c-jun N-terminal kinases (JNK). Simultaneously, LY293111 induced caspase-dependent apoptosis via activation of the intrinsic pathway, including early loss of mitochondrial inner transmembrane potential and the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), cleavage of caspases-9, -3, poly ADP-ribose polymerase (PARP) and X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis.

As cytokines are required for T-cell proliferation, we investigated the effects of IM on cytokine synthesis by T cells of CML patients by assessing cytokine synthesis by activated CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in vitro. The activation of T cells in the whole blood of IM-treated patients (CML-IM) with Staphylococcus enterotoxin B resulted in significantly lower percentages of CD4+ T cells that synthesized interleukin 2 (P = 0.017), interferon-gamma (P = 0.010), and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (P = 0.009) than did the activated T cells of control subjects. The addition of exogenous IM to the cultures of peripheral blood mononuclear cells of CML-IM patients reduced Th1 cytokine synthesis by the CD4+ T cells. Furthermore, IM therapy at clinical doses suppressed the tyrosine phosphorylation of ZAP70. These findings suggest that inhibition of ZAP70 signaling pathway and suppression of Th1 cytokine synthesis by CD4+ T cells required the presence of IM at the time of T-cell activation through the T-cell receptor.","['Gao, H', 'Lee, B-N', 'Talpaz, M', 'Donato, N J', 'Cortes, J E', 'Kantarjian, H M', 'Reuben, J M']","['Gao H', 'Lee BN', 'Talpaz M', 'Donato NJ', 'Cortes JE', 'Kantarjian HM', 'Reuben JM']","['Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Benzamides', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/*drug effects/physiology', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cytokines/*biosynthesis', 'Enterotoxins/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/*immunology', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Phosphorylation', 'Piperazines/*pharmacology', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/metabolism', 'Pyrimidines/*pharmacology', 'Tyrosine', 'ZAP-70 Protein-Tyrosine Kinase']",2005/09/10 09:00,2005/11/16 09:00,['2005/09/10 09:00'],"['2005/09/10 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/11/16 09:00 [medline]', '2005/09/10 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2005 Nov;19(11):1905-11. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2403933.,,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Enterotoxins)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '37337-57-8 (enterotoxin A, Staphylococcal)', '42HK56048U (Tyrosine)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (ZAP-70 Protein-Tyrosine Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (ZAP70 protein, human)']",,"['2403933 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.leu.2403933 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Genotyping of 456 children treated for de novo AML was performed at XPD exon 23. Genotype frequencies in patients were compared with healthy control subject frequencies, and patient outcomes were analyzed according to genotype. Gene frequencies in AML patients and healthy controls were similar.

Therefore, targeting mutated FLT3 is an attractive therapeutic strategy, and early clinical trials testing FLT3 TK inhibitors (TKI) showed measurable clinical responses. Most of these responses were transient; however, in a subset of patients blast recurrence was preceded by an interval of prolonged remission. The etiology of clinical resistance to FLT3-TKI in AML is unclear but is of major significance for the development of future therapeutic strategies. We searched for mechanisms of resistance in 6 patients with AML who had relapses upon PKC412 treatment. In an index AML patient, an algorithm of analyses was applied using clinical material. In vivo and in vitro investigation of primary blasts at relapse revealed persistent TK phosphorylation of FLT3 despite sufficient PKC412 serum levels. Through additional molecular analyses, we identified a single amino acid substitution at position 676 (N676K) within the FLT3 kinase domain as the sole cause of resistance to PKC412 in this patient. Reconstitution experiments expressing the N676K mutant in 32D cells demonstrated that FLT3-ITD-N676K was sufficient to confer an intermediate level of resistance to PKC412 in vitro.

We therefore conducted a comprehensive assessment of 114,548 lymphoid neoplasms diagnosed during 1992-2001 in 12 Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) registries according to the internationally recognized World Health Organization (WHO) lymphoma classification introduced in 2001. Cases coded in International Classification of Diseases for Oncology, Second Edition (ICD-O-2), were converted to ICD-O-3 for WHO subtype assignment. Age-specific and age-adjusted rates were compared by sex and race (white, black, Asian). Age-adjusted trends in incidence were estimated by sex and race using weighted least squares log-linear regression. Diverse incidence patterns and trends were observed by lymphoid neoplasm subtype and population. In the elderly (75 years or older), rates of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and follicular lymphoma increased 1.4% and 1.8% per year, respectively, whereas rates of chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma (CLL/SLL) declined 2.1% per year. Although whites bear the highest incidence burden for most lymphoid neoplasm subtypes, most notably for hairy cell leukemia and follicular lymphoma, black predominance was observed for plasma cell and T-cell neoplasms. Asians have considerably lower rates than whites and blacks for CLL/SLL and Hodgkin lymphoma. We conclude that the striking differences in incidence patterns by histologic subtype strongly suggest that there is etiologic heterogeneity among lymphoid neoplasms and support the pursuit of epidemiologic analysis by subtype.","['Morton, Lindsay M', 'Wang, Sophia S', 'Devesa, Susan S', 'Hartge, Patricia', 'Weisenburger, Dennis D', 'Linet, Martha S']","['Morton LM', 'Wang SS', 'Devesa SS', 'Hartge P', 'Weisenburger DD', 'Linet MS']","['Hormonal and Reproductive Epidemiology Branch, Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics, National Cancer Institute, NIH, DHHS, 6120 Executive Blvd, EPS/7055, Rockville, MD 20852, USA. mortonli@mail.nih.gov']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural']",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Classification', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Lymphoma/classification/*epidemiology/etiology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Racial Groups', 'Registries', 'Sex Factors', 'United States', 'World Health Organization']",2005/09/10 09:00,2006/01/24 09:00,['2005/09/10 09:00'],"['2005/09/10 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/01/24 09:00 [medline]', '2005/09/10 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 2006 Jan 1;107(1):265-76. doi: 10.1182/blood-2005-06-2508.

The maternal and fetal antigens that are transmitted through the bidirectional transplacental passage during pregnancy may induce tolerance to noninherited maternal antigens (NIMAs) in offspring and to inherited paternal antigens (IPAs) in the mother. Using mouse models of bone marrow transplantation (BMT), we found that a ""child-to-mother"" BMT from a NIMA-exposed donor reduced the morbidity and mortality of graft-versus-host disease in an antigen-specific manner; however, a ""mother-to-child"" BMT from an IPA-exposed donor did not. The NIMA-complementary BMT preserved the graft-versus-leukemia effects and favored the immune reconstitution, thus resulting in a marked improvement of the outcome after BMT. These tolerogenic NIMA effects were completely abolished by the depletion of CD4+ CD25+ cells from the donor inocula, thus suggesting the involvement of CD4+ CD25+ regulatory T cells in the tolerogenic NIMA effects. Our findings may therefore have profound implications on the performance of clinical BMT while also potentially helping to develop new strategies for using a NIMA-mismatched donor in the absence of an HLA-identical donor.","['Matsuoka, Ken-ichi', 'Ichinohe, Tatsuo', 'Hashimoto, Daigo', 'Asakura, Shoji', 'Tanimoto, Mitsune', 'Teshima, Takanori']","['Matsuoka K', 'Ichinohe T', 'Hashimoto D', 'Asakura S', 'Tanimoto M', 'Teshima T']","['Biopathological Science, Okayama University Graduate School of Medicine and Dentistry, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Animals', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/*immunology', 'Female', 'Graft Survival', 'Graft vs Host Disease/prevention & control', 'Graft vs Leukemia Effect', '*Immune Tolerance', 'Maternal-Fetal Exchange/*immunology', 'Mice', 'Models, Animal', 'Pregnancy', 'T-Lymphocytes, Regulatory/*physiology', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Treatment Outcome']",2005/09/10 09:00,2006/01/24 09:00,['2005/09/10 09:00'],"['2005/09/10 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/01/24 09:00 [medline]', '2005/09/10 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 2006 Jan 1;107(1):404-9. doi: 10.1182/blood-2005-07-3045.

Inhibition of mTOR using rapamycin leads to a modest decrease in cell survival after 2 days of incubation with more significant decrease in survival after 7 days of culture. However, when rapamycin is added to etoposide in 2-day cultures, there is a dramatic increase in the cytotoxicity of etoposide against AML blasts. Furthermore, etoposide consistently decreased the engraftment of AML cells in nonobese diabetic/severe combined immunodeficient (NOD/SCID) animals, and this effect was enhanced by coincubation with rapamycin, demonstrating that mTOR regulates survival of AML stem cells after etoposide treatment. These results suggest that rapamycin in combination with etoposide-based chemotherapy may be efficacious in the treatment of AML.","['Xu, Qing', 'Thompson, James E', 'Carroll, Martin']","['Xu Q', 'Thompson JE', 'Carroll M']","['Division of Hematology and Oncology, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Culture Media', 'Etoposide/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*metabolism/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Protein Kinases/*metabolism', 'Sirolimus/pharmacology/toxicity', 'Stem Cells/drug effects/metabolism/pathology', 'TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases', 'Time Factors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2005/09/10 09:00,2006/01/07 09:00,['2005/09/10 09:00'],"['2005/09/10 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/01/07 09:00 [medline]', '2005/09/10 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 2005 Dec 15;106(13):4261-8. doi: 10.1182/blood-2004-11-4468.

Leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) is a cytokine that is required for stem cell renewal in mouse but not in human embryonic stem cells. However, feeder layers of embryonic fibroblasts are capable of inducing stem cell renewal in both cell types, suggesting that the self-renewal signaling pathways may also be promoted by other triggers, such as alternative cytokines and/or chemical or physical properties of the extracellular matrix (ECM) secreted by feeder fibroblasts. We have recently used a synthetic polyamide matrix (Ultra-Web) whose three-dimensional (3D) nanofibrillar organization resembles the ECM/basement membrane. Growth of mESCs on this nanofibrillar surface greatly enhanced proliferation and self-renewal in comparison with growth on tissue culture surfaces without nanofibers, despite the presence of LIF in both systems. Enhanced proliferation and self-renewal of the stem cells on nanofibrillar surfaces were correlated with the activation of the small GTPase Rac, the activation of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway, and the enhanced expression of Nanog, a homeoprotein required for maintenance of pluripotency. Inhibitors of PI3K reduced the expression level of Nanog in mESCs cultured on 3D nanofibrillar surfaces. These results provide support for the view that the three-dimensionality of the culture surface may function as a cue for the activation of Rac and PI3K signaling pathways, resulting in stem cell proliferation and self-renewal.","['Nur-E-Kamal, Alam', 'Ahmed, Ijaz', 'Kamal, Jabeen', 'Schindler, Melvin', 'Meiners, Sally']","['Nur-E-Kamal A', 'Ahmed I', 'Kamal J', 'Schindler M', 'Meiners S']","['Department of Pharmacology, UMDNJ-Robert Wood Johnson Medical School, 675 Hoes Lane, Piscataway, New Jersey 08854, USA. nurekasa@umdnj.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Stem Cells,"Stem cells (Dayton, Ohio)",9304532,IM,"['Alkaline Phosphatase/metabolism', 'Animals', 'Cell Count', 'Cell Culture Techniques/*methods', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cell Size', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/metabolism', 'Embryo, Mammalian/*cytology', 'Fibrillar Collagens/*chemistry', 'Homeodomain Proteins/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Monomeric GTP-Binding Proteins/metabolism', 'Nanog Homeobox Protein', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Stem Cells/metabolism/*physiology', 'Tretinoin/pharmacology']",2005/09/10 09:00,2006/08/11 09:00,['2005/09/10 09:00'],"['2005/09/10 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/08/11 09:00 [medline]', '2005/09/10 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Stem Cells. 2006 Feb;24(2):426-33. doi: 10.1634/stemcells.2005-0170.

Furthermore, the addition of HUL-2 to CBC cultures resulted in embryoid bodies forming earlier than in normal cultures.

The keratinocytes were grown and infected with filtered Friend vector supernatant. After one or two doses of infection, one duplicate of the culture was submitted to selection with G418; the other one was utilized for DNA extraction and PCR modification detection. Transduction efficiency was 46.66 percent and 47.22 percent for one and two doses of infection respectively (range 100 to 15 %). Colony Forming Efficiency (CFE) assays were done with Rodhamine-B staining in nonselected modified cultures and negative controls. There was no difference in CFE (% CFE= 10.74+/-6.53 negative control vs % CFE= 9.22+/-5.45 with one dose, and % CFE= 10.03+/-5.74 with two doses of infection). Nevertheless, the cell-cycle analysis done by Propidium Iodade (PI) incorporation and colchicine-arrest assays in nonselected transduced and nontransduced cells show that transduced keratinocytes have a longer time to enter G2. As far as we know, this is the first report of retroviral transduction-induced changes in the cell cycle done on human keratinocytes. This observation is very important because retroviral vectors of genes, such as platelet derived growth factor (PDGF) or vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), are expected to facilitate the implementation of these modified cultures for tissue grafting and skin substitute development and potentiate the effectiveness of the grafts.","['Arango, M', 'Chamorro, C', 'Cohen-Haguenauer, O', 'Rojas, M', 'Restrepo, L M']","['Arango M', 'Chamorro C', 'Cohen-Haguenauer O', 'Rojas M', 'Restrepo LM']","['Grupo de Ingenieria de Tejidos y Terapias Celulares, Facultad de Medicina Universidad de Antioquia Medellin, Colombia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Dermatol Online J,Dermatology online journal,9610776,IM,"['Cells, Cultured', '*Friend murine leukemia virus', '*Genetic Vectors', 'Humans', 'Keratinocytes/*virology', 'Transduction, Genetic']",2005/09/10 09:00,2006/04/01 09:00,['2005/09/10 09:00'],"['2005/09/10 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/04/01 09:00 [medline]', '2005/09/10 09:00 [entrez]']",epublish,Dermatol Online J. 2005 Aug 1;11(2):2.,,,,,,,,20050801,,,,,,,,,,,,

Even in this setting, treatment is non-curative and is directed at reducing the symptoms from an increasing disease burden. Newer treatment regimens incorporating purine nucleoside analogs have increased the rate of successful remission induction in CLL patients. Recent combination chemoimmunotherapy regimens have produced frequent complete molecular remissions, and early evidence suggests this may result in an improved long-term survival. Allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation is the only curative therapy for CLL but is infrequently used due to the older age of most patients, although reduced intensity conditioning regimens have reduced the toxicity of allogeneic transplantation. This review will summarize recent advances in the management of CLL, including prognostic factors, combination chemotherapy including nucleoside analogs and monoclonal antibodies, and reduced intensity allogeneic transplant conditioning regimens.","['Abbott, Brian L']",['Abbott BL'],"['Leukemia/Lymphoma Program, University of Colorado Health Science Center, Aurora, 80010, USA. stem_cell_doc@yahoo.com']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Hematol Oncol,Hematological oncology,8307268,IM,"['Age Factors', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Combined Modality Therapy', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', '*Immunotherapy', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*diagnosis/immunology/*therapy', 'Nucleosides/therapeutic use', 'Prognosis', 'Remission Induction', 'Transplantation Conditioning/methods', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",2005/09/09 09:00,2006/01/04 09:00,['2005/09/09 09:00'],"['2005/09/09 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/01/04 09:00 [medline]', '2005/09/09 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Hematol Oncol. 2005 Mar;23(1):34-40. doi: 10.1002/hon.742.,,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Nucleosides)']",74,['10.1002/hon.742 [doi]'],,"['Copyright 2005 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Now classified by the WHO within a separate nosological group from MDS or MPD, the reality is that there is a dynamic of evolution through increasing monocyte counts in one-third of patients. The principal clinical difference between CMML and other MPD is the presence of ineffective hematopoiesis, manifesting as more frequent anemia and thrombocytopenia in CMML. A fundamental biological characteristic shared with MPD is progenitor hypersensitivity to growth factors, but the pathways mediating this likely differ, as does the lineage specificity. Activation of the STAT pathway in MPD contrasts with frequent RAS pathway activation in CMML. Therapy of CMML is unsatisfactory, with the median age dictating that supportive care and control of myeloproliferation remains the mainstay for the majority. Intensive chemotherapy alone is of little benefit, and stem cell transplantation is the only curative modality in the small number of eligible patients, although outcome remains suboptimal. A deeper understanding of the biological basis of CMML may lead to targeted therapy analogous to the evolving management of MPD best exemplified for chronic myeloid leukemia.","['Bowen, David T']",['Bowen DT'],"['Department of Hematology, Leeds General Infirmary, UK. dt.bowen@dundee.ac.uk']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Hematol Oncol,Hematological oncology,8307268,IM,"['Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Chronic/blood/*classification/therapy', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/blood/*classification/therapy', 'Myelopoiesis', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/blood/*classification/therapy', 'Signal Transduction', 'Stem Cell Transplantation/methods', 'Treatment Outcome', 'World Health Organization']",2005/09/09 09:00,2006/01/04 09:00,['2005/09/09 09:00'],"['2005/09/09 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/01/04 09:00 [medline]', '2005/09/09 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Hematol Oncol. 2005 Mar;23(1):26-33. doi: 10.1002/hon.745.,,,69,['10.1002/hon.745 [doi]'],,"['Copyright 2005 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Treatment of HL-60 cells with docetaxel resulted in the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), activation of caspase-3 (-like) protease, c-Jun N-terminal kinase/stress-activated protein kinase (JNK/SAPK) activation, bcl-2 phosphorylation and apoptosis. Docetaxel elicited ROS production from NADPH oxidase as demonstrated by specific oxidase inhibitor diphenylene iodonium (DPI). ROS mediated the caspase-3 activation and apoptosis in HL-60 cells. The caspase inhibitor acetyl-Asp-Glu-Val-Asp-aldehyde (Ac-DEVD-CHO) effectively inhibited JNK/SAPK activation, bcl-2 phosphorylation and partially attenuated the ROS production induced by docetaxel. Docetaxel-induced bcl-2 phosphorylation was completely blocked by expression of dominant negative JNK or the JNK/SAPK inhibitor SP600125. Overexpression of bcl-2 partially prevented docetaxel-mediated ROS production and subsequent caspase-3 activation, thereby inhibiting apoptotic cell death. It is thus conferred that such sequent events as ROS production, caspase activation, JNK/SAPK activation, bcl-2 phosphorylation and the further generation of ROS should be parts of an amplification loop to increase caspase activity, thereby facilitating the apoptotic cell death process.","['Cao, Dongxu', 'Qiao, Bin', 'Ge, Zhiqiang', 'Yuan, Yingjin']","['Cao D', 'Qiao B', 'Ge Z', 'Yuan Y']","[""Department of Pharmaceutical Engineering, School of Chemical Engineering and Technology, Tianjin University, Tianjin 300072, Peoples' Republic of China.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Cell Biochem,Journal of cellular biochemistry,8205768,IM,"['Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Caspase 3', 'Caspase Inhibitors', 'Caspases/*metabolism', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cytosol', 'Docetaxel', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Models, Biological', 'Phosphorylation', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism', 'Taxoids/*pharmacology', 'Transfection']",2005/09/09 09:00,2006/02/24 09:00,['2005/09/09 09:00'],"['2005/09/09 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/02/24 09:00 [medline]', '2005/09/09 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Cell Biochem. 2005 Nov 1;96(4):810-20. doi: 10.1002/jcb.20563.,,"['0 (Caspase Inhibitors)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '0 (Taxoids)', '15H5577CQD (Docetaxel)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",,['10.1002/jcb.20563 [doi]'],,"['Copyright 2005 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The C-terminus of Runx1/AML1 that includes the nuclear matrix targeting signal (NMTS) is essential for embryonic development, hematopoiesis, and target gene regulation. During the onset and normal progression of hematopoiesis, several lineage-specific factors such as C/EBPalpha and PU.1 interact with Runx1 to regulate transcription combinatorially. Here we addressed the functional interplay between subnuclear targeting of Runx1 and gene activation during hematopoiesis. Point mutations were generated in the NMTS of the human Runx1 protein and tested for their effect on transcriptional cooperativity with C/EBPalpha and PU.1 at myeloid-specific promoters. We characterized five mutants that do not alter nuclear import, DNA binding or C/EBPalpha-dependent synergistic activation of the target gene promoters. However a critical tyrosine in the NMTS is required for subnuclear targeting and activation of the granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) promoter. Furthermore, this point mutation is defective for transcriptional synergism with PU.1 on the macrophage colony stimulating factor (MCSF) receptor c-FMS promoter. Our results indicate that the NMTS region of Runx1 is required for functional interactions with PU.1. Taken together, our findings establish that subnuclear targeting of Runx1 is a critical component of myeloid-specific transcriptional control.","['Li, Xiangen', 'Vradii, Diana', 'Gutierrez, Soraya', 'Lian, Jane B', 'van Wijnen, Andre J', 'Stein, Janet L', 'Stein, Gary S', 'Javed, Amjad']","['Li X', 'Vradii D', 'Gutierrez S', 'Lian JB', 'van Wijnen AJ', 'Stein JL', 'Stein GS', 'Javed A']","['Department of Cell Biology and Cancer Center, University of Massachusetts Medical School, Worcester, Massachusetts 01655, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",United States,J Cell Biochem,Journal of cellular biochemistry,8205768,IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Protein-alpha/metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Nucleus/*metabolism', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*genetics', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutation/genetics', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/*genetics', 'Protein Transport', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*metabolism', 'Receptor, Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/*genetics', 'Trans-Activators/*metabolism', '*Transcriptional Activation']",2005/09/09 09:00,2006/02/24 09:00,['2005/09/09 09:00'],"['2005/09/09 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/02/24 09:00 [medline]', '2005/09/09 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Cell Biochem. 2005 Nov 1;96(4):795-809. doi: 10.1002/jcb.20548.,"['AR050561/AR/NIAMS NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA82834/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['0 (CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Protein-alpha)', '0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (RUNX1 protein, human)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (proto-oncogene protein Spi-1)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor, Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",,['10.1002/jcb.20548 [doi]'],,"['Copyright 2005 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Patients with CLL typically do not receive any treatment soon after the initial diagnosis. Although there is no known cure for CLL yet, when treated, the patients receive aggressive and expensive therapies (eg, chemotherapy or bone marrow transplantation). A rigorous and systematic literature review was performed of English-language articles published in 1990-2002. It was supplemented with additional articles published before 1990 for completeness and additional references to fill the gaps identified in the published medical literature. The literature on the quality of life (QOL) of CLL patients is very limited. We identified only 8 articles, and none of them analyzed the QOL in untreated CLL patients. Because CLL is a disease affecting adults, especially the elderly, all 8 studies measured the QOL in the adult population. QOL difficulties include fear of death and disability, problems gaining employment or health insurance, and fatigue. No specific leukemia or CLL instruments but general QOL instruments (eg, I-HRQL) were identified and some cancer-specific ones (eg, EORTC QLQ-C30, FACT-G, FACT Anemia, FACT-Fatigue). Interestingly, a FACT-Bone Marrow Transplant instrument exists, although we found no study on CLL that used it. Even the literature on the economic burden of CLL is very limited. We identified 13 studies on the cost of CLL: Most of them were cost-identification or cost-comparison studies, and 5 dealt with the cost-effectiveness of medical interventions to treat CLL. Cost drivers identified for CLL were the chemotherapy costs, intravenous immunoglobulin costs, transplantation costs, and costs associated with the differential staining cytotoxicity assay. We identified very few articles on the QOL of CLL patients and therefore cannot draw strong conclusions about the key QOL predictors. Nevertheless, patients with anemia were found to have a better QOL if they had higher hemoglobin counts and good response to erythropoietin treatment. The articles published seem to demonstrate that the older the age of the patient was, the poorer the QOL. The main cost drivers identified for CLL were related to the treatment chosen (eg, chemotherapy, bone marrow transplantation). There are hints that higher costs often result from the delivery of non-optimal therapy that leads to adverse events, infections, and drug resistance. In summary, the impact of this disease on the health care budget of the different health care providers and payers as well as on the patient's QOL is substantially unknown, calling for appropriate economic and QOL studies.","['Stephens, Jennifer M', 'Gramegna, Paola', 'Laskin, Benjamin', 'Botteman, Marc F', 'Pashos, Chris L']","['Stephens JM', 'Gramegna P', 'Laskin B', 'Botteman MF', 'Pashos CL']","['HERQuLES, Bethesda, Maryland, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review', 'Systematic Review']",United States,Am J Ther,American journal of therapeutics,9441347,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*economics/therapeutic use', 'Cost-Benefit Analysis', 'Female', '*Health Expenditures', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulins, Intravenous/economics', 'Immunologic Factors/economics', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*economics/*psychology/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Quality of Life', 'Stem Cell Transplantation/economics']",2005/09/09 09:00,2005/12/22 09:00,['2005/09/09 09:00'],"['2005/09/09 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/12/22 09:00 [medline]', '2005/09/09 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Am J Ther. 2005 Sep-Oct;12(5):460-6. doi: 10.1097/01.mjt.0000104489.93653.0f.,,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Immunoglobulins, Intravenous)', '0 (Immunologic Factors)']",26,"['00045391-200509000-00011 [pii]', '10.1097/01.mjt.0000104489.93653.0f [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Mechanism of action of plaferon LB and fenovit was manifested in the reconstitution of mechanisms of apoptosis among erythroblasts, which did not contain synthesized Rausche virus.

METHODS: We randomly assigned 760 consecutive adult patients with cancer in whom chemotherapy-induced neutropenia (<1000 neutrophils per cubic millimeter) was expected to occur for more than seven days to receive either oral levofloxacin (500 mg daily) or placebo from the start of chemotherapy until the resolution of neutropenia. Patients were stratified according to their underlying disease (acute leukemia vs. solid tumor or lymphoma). RESULTS: An intention-to-treat analysis showed that fever was present for the duration of neutropenia in 65 percent of patients who received levofloxacin prophylaxis, as compared with 85 percent of those receiving placebo (243 of 375 vs. 308 of 363; relative risk, 0.76; absolute difference in risk, -20 percent; 95 percent confidence interval, -26 to -14 percent; P=0.001). The levofloxacin group had a lower rate of microbiologically documented infections (absolute difference in risk, -17 percent; 95 percent confidence interval, -24 to -10 percent; P<0.001), bacteremias (difference in risk, -16 percent; 95 percent confidence interval, -22 to -9 percent; P<0.001), and single-agent gram-negative bacteremias (difference in risk, -7 percent; 95 percent confidence interval, -10 to -2 percent; P<0.01) than did the placebo group. Mortality and tolerability were similar in the two groups. The effects of prophylaxis were also similar between patients with acute leukemia and those with solid tumors or lymphoma. CONCLUSIONS: Prophylactic treatment with levofloxacin is an effective and well-tolerated way of preventing febrile episodes and other relevant infection-related outcomes in patients with cancer and profound and protracted neutropenia. The long-term effect of this intervention on microbial resistance in the community is not known.","['Bucaneve, Giampaolo', 'Micozzi, Alessandra', 'Menichetti, Francesco', 'Martino, Pietro', 'Dionisi, M Stella', 'Martinelli, Giovanni', 'Allione, Bernardino', ""D'Antonio, Domenico"", 'Buelli, Maurizio', 'Nosari, A Maria', 'Cilloni, Daniela', 'Zuffa, Eliana', 'Cantaffa, Renato', 'Specchia, Giorgina', 'Amadori, Sergio', 'Fabbiano, Francesco', 'Deliliers, Giorgio Lambertenghi', 'Lauria, Francesco', 'Foa, Robin', 'Del Favero, Albano']","['Bucaneve G', 'Micozzi A', 'Menichetti F', 'Martino P', 'Dionisi MS', 'Martinelli G', 'Allione B', ""D'Antonio D"", 'Buelli M', 'Nosari AM', 'Cilloni D', 'Zuffa E', 'Cantaffa R', 'Specchia G', 'Amadori S', 'Fabbiano F', 'Deliliers GL', 'Lauria F', 'Foa R', 'Del Favero A']","['Policlinico Monteluce, Perugia, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,N Engl J Med,The New England journal of medicine,0255562,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', '*Antibiotic Prophylaxis', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Bacteremia/microbiology/mortality', 'Bacterial Infections/etiology/*prevention & control', 'Double-Blind Method', 'Female', 'Fever of Unknown Origin/prevention & control', 'Humans', '*Levofloxacin', 'Logistic Models', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms/complications/*drug therapy/mortality', 'Neutropenia/chemically induced/*complications/drug therapy', 'Ofloxacin/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Risk']",2005/09/09 09:00,2005/09/17 09:00,['2005/09/09 09:00'],"['2005/09/09 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/09/17 09:00 [medline]', '2005/09/09 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,N Engl J Med. 2005 Sep 8;353(10):977-87. doi: 10.1056/NEJMoa044097.,,"['0 (Anti-Bacterial Agents)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '6GNT3Y5LMF (Levofloxacin)', 'A4P49JAZ9H (Ofloxacin)']",,"['353/10/977 [pii]', '10.1056/NEJMoa044097 [doi]']",,['Copyright 2005 Massachusetts Medical Society.'],"[""Gruppo Italiano Malattie Ematologiche dell'Adulto (GIMEMA) Infection Program""]",,,,"['N Engl J Med. 2005 Sep 8;353(10):1052-4.

Among them, N-arachidonoyldopamine (NADA) is an endogenous lipid mediator sharing endocannabinoid and endovanilloid biological activities. We have reported previously that NADA exerts some of its biological activities through inhibition of the NF-kappaB pathway and, because this transcription factor plays a key role in HIV-1-long terminal repeat (LTR) trans activation, we have evaluated the anti-HIV-1 activity of NADA. In this study, we show that NADA inhibits vesicular stomatitis virus-pseudotyped HIV-1 infection in the human leukemia T cell line Jurkat, in primary T cells, and in the human astrocytic cell line U373-MG. Other endocannabinoids such as anandamide, 2-arachidonoylglycerol, and noladin ether did not show inhibitory activity in the HIV-1 replication assays. The anti-HIV-1 activity of NADA was independent of known cannabinoid and vanilloid receptor activation. In addition, NADA did not affect reverse transcription and integration steps of the viral cycle, and its inhibitory effect was additive with that of the reverse transcriptase inhibitor azidothymidine. NADA inhibited both TNF-alpha and HIV-1 trans activator protein-induced HIV-1-LTR activation. We also show that NADA counteracts the TNF-alpha-mediated trans activation capacity of the p65 NF-kappaB subunit without affecting its physical association to the HIV-1-LTR promoter. Moreover, NADA inhibited the p65 transcriptional activity by specifically targeting the phosphorylation of this NF-kappaB subunit at Ser(536). These findings provide new mechanistic insights into the biological activities of NADA, and highlight the potential of lipid mediators for the management of AIDS.","['Sancho, Rocio', 'de la Vega, Laureano', 'Macho, Antonio', 'Appendino, Giovanni', 'Di Marzo, Vincenzo', 'Munoz, Eduardo']","['Sancho R', 'de la Vega L', 'Macho A', 'Appendino G', 'Di Marzo V', 'Munoz E']","['Departamento de Biologia Celular, Fisiologia e Inmunologia, Universidad de Cordoba, Facultad de Medicina, Cordoba, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,IM,"['Anti-HIV Agents/*pharmacology', 'Arachidonic Acids/*pharmacology', 'Cannabinoid Receptor Modulators/pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Dopamine/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'HIV-1/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Lipids', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Reverse Transcription/drug effects', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/genetics', 'Virus Integration/drug effects', 'Virus Replication/drug effects']",2005/09/09 09:00,2005/12/13 09:00,['2005/09/09 09:00'],"['2005/09/09 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/12/13 09:00 [medline]', '2005/09/09 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 2005 Sep 15;175(6):3990-9. doi: 10.4049/jimmunol.175.6.3990.,,"['0 (Anti-HIV Agents)', '0 (Arachidonic Acids)', '0 (Cannabinoid Receptor Modulators)', '0 (Lipids)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '0 (arachidonyl dopamine)', 'VTD58H1Z2X (Dopamine)']",,"['175/6/3990 [pii]', '10.4049/jimmunol.175.6.3990 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: From June 1997 until November 2000, 604 patients with T1-3N1M0 or T3N0M0 tumors were randomized to three cycles of epirubicin 110 mg/m2 followed by three cycles of paclitaxel 250 mg/m2 followed by three cycles of 'intensified' CMF (cyclophosphamide 840 mg/m2, methotrexate 47 mg/m2 and fluorouracil 840 mg/m2) (group A), or to four cycles of epirubicin followed by four cycles of CMF, as in group A (group B). All cycles were given every 2 weeks with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor support. RESULTS: A total of 595 patients were eligible. Median follow-up was 61.7 months for group A and 62 months for group B. The 3-year DFS was 80% in group A and 77% in group B. Survival rates were 93% and 90%, respectively. The effect of treatment on the hazard of death was different according to hormonal receptor status. More specifically, in patients with negative receptor status the hazard of death was significantly higher for group B (hazard ratio 2.42). Both regimens were well tolerated and severe acute side-effects were infrequent. No cases of severe cardiotoxicity or acute leukemia were recorded. CONCLUSIONS: The present study failed to demonstrate a significant difference in DFS or OS between the two treatment groups. However, our study has shown clearly that high-dose paclitaxel can be safely incorporated to dose-dense sequential chemotherapy.","['Fountzilas, G', 'Skarlos, D', 'Dafni, U', 'Gogas, H', 'Briasoulis, E', 'Pectasides, D', 'Papadimitriou, C', 'Markopoulos, C', 'Polychronis, A', 'Kalofonos, H P', 'Siafaka, V', 'Kosmidis, P', 'Timotheadou, E', 'Tsavdaridis, D', 'Bafaloukos, D', 'Papakostas, P', 'Razis, E', 'Makrantonakis, P', 'Aravantinos, G', 'Christodoulou, C', 'Dimopoulos, A-M']","['Fountzilas G', 'Skarlos D', 'Dafni U', 'Gogas H', 'Briasoulis E', 'Pectasides D', 'Papadimitriou C', 'Markopoulos C', 'Polychronis A', 'Kalofonos HP', 'Siafaka V', 'Kosmidis P', 'Timotheadou E', 'Tsavdaridis D', 'Bafaloukos D', 'Papakostas P', 'Razis E', 'Makrantonakis P', 'Aravantinos G', 'Christodoulou C', 'Dimopoulos AM']","['Aristotle University of Thessaloniki School of Medicine, Thessaloniki, Greece. fountzil@med.auth.gr']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial, Phase III', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Ann Oncol,Annals of oncology : official journal of the European Society for Medical Oncology,9007735,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Breast Neoplasms/*drug therapy/surgery', 'Cyclophosphamide/administration & dosage', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Epirubicin/administration & dosage', 'Female', 'Fluorouracil/administration & dosage', 'Humans', 'Methotrexate/administration & dosage', 'Middle Aged', 'Paclitaxel/administration & dosage', 'Risk Factors', 'Survival Rate', 'Treatment Outcome']",2005/09/09 09:00,2006/02/10 09:00,['2005/09/09 09:00'],"['2005/09/09 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/02/10 09:00 [medline]', '2005/09/09 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Ann Oncol. 2005 Nov;16(11):1762-71. doi: 10.1093/annonc/mdi366.

By extrapolation, donor-specific transplantation tolerance might be controlled by donor-specific Treg that have acquired the appropriate epigenetic program for tolerance. Although such tolerance has yet to be achieved in man, proof of concept comes from mouse models where regulatory transplantation tolerance can be induced within the complex micro-environment of the spleen or draining lymph node. By studying whole spleen cell populations in a murine model of transplantation tolerance we have incorporated a complexity of environmental factors when looking for specific features that characterize tolerance versus aggression. This approach has revealed unexpected patterns of gene activity in tolerance and most notably that a novel stem cell gene, axotrophin, regulates T lymphocyte responsiveness both in terms of proliferation and in release of leukaemia inhibitory factor (LIF). Since LIF is a regulator of stem cells in addition to being a key neuropoietic cytokine, these preliminary results linking both axotrophin and LIF to transplantation tolerance lead us to propose that regulatory pathways encoded during the epigenetic development of Treg cells are related to pathways that regulate fate determination of stem cells.","['Metcalfe, Su M']",['Metcalfe SM'],"['Department of Surgery, University of Cambridge, UK. smm1001@cam.ac.uk']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",England,Philos Trans R Soc Lond B Biol Sci,"Philosophical transactions of the Royal Society of London.

The possibility that environmental EMFs represent a health hazard has serious economic implications for government, the electricity industry and society, as well as raising several profound scientific challenges, including, in particular, biophysical mechanisms, experimental replication and scientific uncertainty. These challenges are explored in relation to the experiences of the EMF Biological Research Trust, a UK medical research charity which funds basic research on the biological effects of extremely low-frequency electromagnetic fields (ELF-EMFs).

However, during a series of leukapheresis procedures (LP) the CD34 value on the final HPC product may not be available for testing until late evening, sometimes resulting in additional, retrospectively unnecessary, LP in order to ensure an adequate HPC collection (>5x10(6) CD34/kg). We hypothesized that an estimate of the CD34 content of HPC products prior to 16:00 h on the day of LP would permit improved HPC collection planning. We therefore assessed the effectiveness of predicting the total amount of CD34 cells that would be collected in a given LP by either (a) the concentration of CD34 cells/microL in peripheral blood prior to LP (pre-CD34) or (b) the predicted total amount of CD34 cells to be collected based on sampling the LP product at the mid-point of each LP. We also compared the number of LP per patient and total HPC collected for the study group with data from the previous calendar year. METHODS: Allogeneic and autologous BMT donors who completed a 20-L HPC collection between September 2002 and February 2003 were eligible. CD34 cells were measured on blood drawn prior to LP and from the HPC product at the mid-point (10 L) of LP. The CD34 content of the final LP was predicted by doubling the value of total CD34 cells at the mid-run (MRp-CD34). The MRp-CD34/kg and the cumulative CD34/kg collected were made available before 16:00 h and used to determine the need for additional LP. The true CD34 content of each HPC collection was also measured from the final product the next day (CD34-FP). RESULTS: A 20-L LP was completed and data were available from 31 patients and nine allogeneic donors who underwent a total of 85 LP for diagnoses, including 11 myeloma, 10 lymphoma, seven HD, three acute leukemia and five others. The mean (range) and correlation (R2) vs. the CD34-FP were, for pre-CD34, 54 CD34/microL (0.3-232), R2=0.66 (P<0.01), and for MRp-CD34, 3.2x10(6) CD34/kg (0.04-22.48), R2=0.90 (P<0.01). The mean number of CD34/kg collected per LP in the patients/donors was 3.4x10(6) CD34/kg (0.05-18.94). The median number of CD34 cells employed for transplant in the study group vs. controls (5.7 vs. 5.6x10(6)/kg) and the time to engraftment of neutrophils (12 vs. 11 days) and platelets (12 vs. 12 days) was similar to historical controls. However, the study group had a significantly lower median number of LP (three vs. two; P<0.02) to obtain the required collection of 5x10(6) CD34 cells/kg. DISCUSSION: Both the pre-CD34 and the MRp-CD34 were significantly correlated with CD34-FP. However, the CD34-FP was more reliably predicted by MRp-CD34. Early availability of mid-run CD34 values was associated with a significant reduction in the number of LP required to collect 5x10(6) CD34 cells/kg, without reduction in the number of CD34 cells for transplant or prolongation of days to neutrophil or platelet engraftment.","['Lane, T A', 'Bashey, A', 'Carrier, E', 'Holman, P', 'Castro, J', 'Mullen, M', 'Ward, D M', 'Ada, O', 'Ball, E D']","['Lane TA', 'Bashey A', 'Carrier E', 'Holman P', 'Castro J', 'Mullen M', 'Ward DM', 'Ada O', 'Ball ED']","['Department of Pathology, School of Medicine, University of California, San Diego, CA, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Cytotherapy,Cytotherapy,100895309,IM,"['Antigens, CD34/*metabolism', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Mobilization', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*cytology/metabolism', 'Humans', '*Leukapheresis']",2005/09/09 09:00,2006/02/17 09:00,['2005/09/09 09:00'],"['2005/09/09 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/02/17 09:00 [medline]', '2005/09/09 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cytotherapy. 2004;6(4):318-27. doi: 10.1080/14653240410004880.,,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)']",,"['NFHE6NPW99Q4HFDR [pii]', '10.1080/14653240410004880 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The IGFBP-4 levels of ALL patients at diagnosis were significantly lower than the levels of healthy control subjects. We evaluated the patients at diagnosis and after 33 days of chemotherapy and found plasma IGFBP-4 levels at day 33 to be significantly lower than the levels at diagnosis.

Gene expression analysis of the leukemic blast population at diagnosis revealed that the leukemic clones did not significantly contribute to systemic IGFBP-4 levels. The decrease in plasma IGFBP-4 levels during chemotherapy represents an indirect effect, probably caused by the chemotherapeutic effects on IGFBP-4-expressing cells of the liver and other organs.

Both the percentage and the absolute number of annexin V-positive erythrocytes gradually increased immediately after chemotherapy. This result paralleled the change in the serum levels of bilirubin, suggesting a direct induction of PS-externalization in mature erythrocytes and a subsequent increase in erythrocyte clearance by splenic macrophages. The PS-exposing erythrocyte counts showed negative correlations to platelet and reticulocyte counts, which reflect the hematopoietic potential in the bone marrow. This result suggests that bone marrow suppression could be responsible for the enlarged senescent population in the circulation. Moreover, PS-exposing erythrocytes in the circulation remained at relatively high levels even after the serum level of bilirubin normalized, indicating that the decreased clearance of senescent erythrocytes as a result of impaired phagocytosis following bone marrow suppression might also be involved in the increase in PS-exposing erythrocytes in the circulation late after chemotherapy.","['Zhang, Xiaochun', 'Inukai, Takeshi', 'Hirose, Kinuko', 'Akahane, Koshi', 'Nemoto, Atsushi', 'Takahashi, Kazuya', 'Sato, Hiroki', 'Kagami, Keiko', 'Goi, Kumiko', 'Sugita, Kanji', 'Nakazawa, Shinpei']","['Zhang X', 'Inukai T', 'Hirose K', 'Akahane K', 'Nemoto A', 'Takahashi K', 'Sato H', 'Kagami K', 'Goi K', 'Sugita K', 'Nakazawa S']","['Department of Pediatrics, School of Medicine, University of Yamanashi, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Japan,Int J Hematol,International journal of hematology,9111627,IM,"['Annexin A5/metabolism', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/*administration & dosage', 'Bone Marrow/metabolism/pathology', 'Cellular Senescence/drug effects', 'Cytarabine/*administration & dosage', 'Erythrocyte Membrane/*metabolism/pathology', 'Erythropoiesis/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Phospholipids/*metabolism', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/blood/*drug therapy/pathology']",2005/09/09 09:00,2005/12/13 09:00,['2005/09/09 09:00'],"['2005/09/09 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/12/13 09:00 [medline]', '2005/09/09 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Int J Hematol. 2005 Aug;82(2):132-6. doi: 10.1532/IJH97.05009.,,"['0 (Annexin A5)', '0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Phospholipids)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)']",,"['E4HKLG13KWJ2502R [pii]', '10.1532/IJH97.05009 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

FLT3/ITD and FLT3/KDM occur in 15% to 35% and 5% to 10%, respectively, of patients with AML. FLT3 mutations are, therefore, the most frequent genetic alterations so far reported in AML.

Although the clinical significance of FLT3/KDM is controversial, the meta-analysis suggests its adverse effect on the outcome. FLT3/ITD is far less common in patients with ALL, whereas FLT3/KDM is recurrently found in patients with ALL, especially in those harboring an MLL gene rearrangement or hyperdiploidy. The overexpression of FLT3 transcripts has been demonstrated in a pro-portion of the AML patients without FLT3 mutations, which are associated with a poor prognosis for overall survival.

The TCL1 expression and EBV status of 14 sporadic pediatric BL cases was determined by immunohistochemical staining for TCL1 and in situ hybridization for EBV-encoded RNA (EBER). Our results showed TCL1 protein in 11 cases, predominantly in the nucleus with strong-intensity staining. EBER was positive in 4 cases, with 3 of these cases also TCL1+. In the 10 cases that were EBER-, TCL1 was strongly positive in 8. These data indicate that the TCL1 oncoprotein is expressed strongly in most pediatric BL cases. However, persistent EBV is not essential for increased TCL1 expression, although elevated TCL1 and c-MYC coexpression might cooperate in the development of most pediatric and adult BL cases.","['Teitell, Michael A', 'Lones, Mark A', 'Perkins, Sherrie L', 'Sanger, Warren G', 'Cairo, Mitchell S', 'Said, Jonathan W']","['Teitell MA', 'Lones MA', 'Perkins SL', 'Sanger WG', 'Cairo MS', 'Said JW']","['Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Jonsson Comprehensive Cancer Center, David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA, Los Angeles, CA, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Am J Clin Pathol,American journal of clinical pathology,0370470,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/metabolism', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/genetics/*metabolism/pathology/virology', 'Cell Nucleus/metabolism/pathology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Chromosome Banding', 'Female', 'Herpesvirus 4, Human/genetics/*isolation & purification', 'Humans', 'Immunoenzyme Techniques', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Karyotyping', 'Lymphoid Tissue/*metabolism/pathology/virology', 'Male', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*metabolism', 'RNA, Viral/analysis', 'RNA-Binding Proteins/metabolism', 'Ribosomal Proteins/metabolism']",2005/09/09 09:00,2005/11/05 09:00,['2005/09/09 09:00'],"['2005/09/09 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/11/05 09:00 [medline]', '2005/09/09 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Am J Clin Pathol. 2005 Oct;124(4):569-75. doi: 10.1309/77V7U4E03V69QHRR.,"['R01 CA107300/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA90571/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Viral)', '0 (RNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Ribosomal Proteins)', '0 (TCL1A protein, human)', '135844-68-7 (RPL22 protein, human)']",,"['77V7U4E03V69QHRR [pii]', '10.1309/77V7U4E03V69QHRR [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Imatinib was the first small molecule developed to inhibit BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase activity and its success introduced the current era of molecularly targeted therapies for a number of other malignancies. In patients with chronic myeloid leukaemia who develop resistance to imatinib, the Bcr-Abl signaling pathway is often re-established.

This advanced phase can sometimes be subdivided into an earlier accelerated phase and a later blast phase or blast transformation--in about one-half of patients the chronic phase transforms unpredictably and abruptly to a blast phase, while in the other half of patients, the disease evolves somewhat more gradually, through an accelerated phase, which may last for months or years, before a blast phase ensues; this may have myeloblastic or lymphoblastic features. Although much is now known about the molecular biology of the disease, the molecular basis of disease progression is still obscure. The popular thinking has been that one or more probably a sequence of additional genetic events occurs in the BCR-ABL positive clone.

Although their cells of origin or classification are still controversial several entities clearly represent a distinct type of neoplasms that are clinically aggressive. METHODS: In this work we present the immunophenotypic and genotypic features of bone marrow (BM), peripheral blood (PB), lymph node and skin lymphocytes from a patient diagnosed as plasmacytoid dendritic cell leukemia involving the skin, BM, PB, lymph nodes, liver and spleen. For determination of immunophenotypic characteristics of malignant plasmacytoid dendritic cells 73 monoclonal antibodies detecting lineage markers, chemokine receptors, cytokine receptors, activation, and co-stimulatory molecules were used. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: The malignant cells proved to express CD4+, CD56+ lineage negative leukemia phenotype characteristically positive for CD36, CD38, CD40, CD45, CD45RA, CD68, CD123, CD184, HLA-DR, BDCA2, and granzyme-B corresponding to the preplasmacytoid dendritic cell developmental stage.

We propose that polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification of the rearranged TCR gene in HTLV-I healthy carriers would be a convenient method for establishing the nature of the circulating T lymphocytes in asymptomatic HTLV-I carriers, presenting only mild and inconclusive signals of deviation from normality. METHODS: Using PCR, we analyzed the genetic recombination pattern of the T-cell beta-chain receptor gene (TCR-beta) in order to identify clonal expansion of peripheral blood T lymphocytes in 17 HTLV-I-positive healthy carriers and in nine normal HTLV-I-negative blood donors. To evaluate the performance of PCR in detection of clonality, we also analyzed 18 patients with post-thymic/mature T-cell malignancies presenting circulating abnormal lymphocytes. RESULTS: Seven of the 17 HTLV-I positive individuals presented circulating abnormal lymphocytes; monoclonal or oligoclonal expansion of T-cells was detected in five of the 17 HTLV-I-positive individuals, all of them presenting abnormal lymphocytes. Clonal expansion was not detected in any of the negative controls or in any of the 12 remaining healthy carriers. All patients in the positive control group tested positive by PCR and Southern blots. Southern blots were negative for all 17 healthy carriers. CONCLUSIONS: PCR amplification of segments of rearranged TCR-beta is reliable for allowing early detection of small populations of clonal T cells in blood samples from asymptomatic HTLV-I carriers, providing an additional alert in the follow-up of carriers with abnormal circulating lymphocytes.","['Sales, Maria M', 'Bezerra, Camila N A', 'Hiraki, Yumi', 'Melo, Neusa B', 'Reboucas, Nancy A']","['Sales MM', 'Bezerra CN', 'Hiraki Y', 'Melo NB', 'Reboucas NA']","['Servico de Hematologia, Divisao de Laboratorio Central, Departamento de Patologia/Hospital das Clinicas, Universidade de Sao Paulo, Av.

In this study, expression of VEGF and PlGF in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) cells was examined by real time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction in 20 patient samples. Expression of PlGF was more intense in Philadelphia chromosome positive (Ph(+)) ALL than in Ph(-) ALL cases. On the other hand, expression level of VEGF was not different between Ph(+) and Ph(-) cases. Then, PlGF was added to the two ALL cell lines, CRL1929 (Ph(+)), and Nalm6 (Ph(-)). The PlGF stimulated the growth of CRL1929 in time- and dose-dependent manners, although the growth of Nalm6 was not affected by PlGF. The growth stimulation of CRL1929 by PlGF was confirmed by the increase of S phase cells. And the growth promoting effect of PlGF on CRL1929 was cancelled by simultaneous addition of VEGFR1/Fc (which binds to PlGF and abrogates its function), but was not cancelled by VEGFR2/Fc (which does not bind to PlGF). Then, addition of VEGFR1/Fc to the simple culture of CRL1929 demonstrated growth inhibitory effect. These observations demonstrated that PlGF stimulates the growth of Ph(+) ALL cells by both autocrine and paracrine pathways. Finally, PlGF-VEGFR1 loop might be a therapeutic target to improve the prognosis of Ph(+) ALL.","['Ikai, Toshiko', 'Miwa, Hiroshi', 'Shikami, Masato', 'Hiramatsu, Akihito', 'Tajima, Emi', 'Yamamoto, Hidesuke', 'Imai, Norikazu', 'Hattori, Akiko', 'Nishii, Kazuhiro', 'Miura, Kazuhisa', 'Satoh, Atsushi', 'Itoh, Masato', 'Imamura, Akira', 'Mihara, Hidetsugu', 'Katoh, Yoshiro', 'Nitta, Masakazu']","['Ikai T', 'Miwa H', 'Shikami M', 'Hiramatsu A', 'Tajima E', 'Yamamoto H', 'Imai N', 'Hattori A', 'Nishii K', 'Miura K', 'Satoh A', 'Itoh M', 'Imamura A', 'Mihara H', 'Katoh Y', 'Nitta M']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Division of Haematology, Aichi Medical University School of Medicine, Nagakute, Aichi 480-1195, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Eur J Haematol,European journal of haematology,8703985,IM,"['Autocrine Communication/*physiology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', '*Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Humans', 'Paracrine Communication/*physiology', 'Placenta Growth Factor', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/metabolism/*pathology', 'Pregnancy Proteins/genetics/pharmacology/*physiology', 'RNA, Neoplasm/analysis', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'S Phase', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A/genetics', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Receptor-1/physiology']",2005/09/09 09:00,2005/10/19 09:00,['2005/09/09 09:00'],"['2005/09/09 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/10/19 09:00 [medline]', '2005/09/09 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Eur J Haematol. 2005 Oct;75(4):273-9. doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0609.2005.00505.x.,,"['0 (PGF protein, human)', '0 (Pregnancy Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A)', '144589-93-5 (Placenta Growth Factor)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Receptor-1)']",,"['EJH505 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1600-0609.2005.00505.x [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: This was a prospective phase II trial of rituximab plus fractionated cyclophosphamide, vincristine, doxorubicin, and dexamethasone (hyper-CVAD; considered one cycle) alternating every 21 days with rituximab plus high-dose methotrexate-cytarabine (considered one cycle) for a total of six to eight cycles. RESULTS: Of 97 assessable patients, 97% responded, and 87% achieved a complete response (CR) or unconfirmed CR. With a median follow-up time of 40 months, the 3-year FFS and overall survival rates were 64% and 82%, respectively, without a plateau in the curves. For the subgroup of patients < or = 65 years of age, the 3-year FFS rate was 73%. The principal toxicity was hematologic. Five patients died from acute toxicity. Four patients developed treatment-related myelodysplasia/acute myelogenous leukemia, and three patients died while in remission from MCL. A total of eight treatment-related deaths (8%) occurred. CONCLUSION: Rituximab plus hyper-CVAD alternating with rituximab plus high-dose methotrexate and cytarabine is effective in untreated aggressive MCL. Toxicity is significant but expected. Because of the shorter FFS concurrent with significant toxicity in patients more than 65 years of age, this regimen is not recommended as standard therapy for this age subgroup. Larger prospective randomized studies are needed to define the role of this regimen in the treatment of MCL patients compared with existing and new treatment modalities.","['Romaguera, Jorge E', 'Fayad, Luis', 'Rodriguez, Maria A', 'Broglio, Kristine R', 'Hagemeister, Frederick B', 'Pro, Barbara', 'McLaughlin, Peter', 'Younes, Anas', 'Samaniego, Felipe', 'Goy, Andre', 'Sarris, Andreas H', 'Dang, Nam H', 'Wang, Michael', 'Beasley, Virginia', 'Medeiros, L Jeffrey', 'Katz, Ruth L', 'Gagneja, Harish', 'Samuels, Barry I', 'Smith, Terry L', 'Cabanillas, Fernando F']","['Romaguera JE', 'Fayad L', 'Rodriguez MA', 'Broglio KR', 'Hagemeister FB', 'Pro B', 'McLaughlin P', 'Younes A', 'Samaniego F', 'Goy A', 'Sarris AH', 'Dang NH', 'Wang M', 'Beasley V', 'Medeiros LJ', 'Katz RL', 'Gagneja H', 'Samuels BI', 'Smith TL', 'Cabanillas FF']","['Department of Lymphoma, Unit 429, The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030, USA. jromague@mdanderson.org']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Clinical Trial, Phase II', 'Journal Article']",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,IM,"['Administration, Oral', 'Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/administration & dosage', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Cyclophosphamide/administration & dosage', 'Dexamethasone/administration & dosage', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Doxorubicin/administration & dosage', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infusions, Intravenous', 'Lymphoma, Mantle-Cell/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Rituximab', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Vincristine/administration & dosage']",2005/09/08 09:00,2005/11/03 09:00,['2005/09/08 09:00'],"['2005/09/08 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/11/03 09:00 [medline]', '2005/09/08 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2005 Oct 1;23(28):7013-23. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2005.01.1825.

However, it is not known how specific post-transplantation events (acute or chronic graft-versus-host disease [GVHD], treatment-related mortality [TRM], and relapse) may explain mortality differences. The purpose of this study was to examine the relationship between ethnicity and post-transplantation events and determine their net effect on survival. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We identified 3,028 patients with acute myeloid leukemia, acute lymphoblastic leukemia, or chronic myeloid leukemia reported to the International Bone Marrow Transplant Registry between 1990 and 2000 who received an HLA-identical sibling HSCT after a myeloablative conditioning regimen in the United States. There were 2,418 white patients (80%) and 610 ethnic minority patients (20%), of whom 251 were black (8%), 122 were Asian (4%), and 237 were Hispanic (8%). Cox proportional hazards regression was used to compare outcomes between whites and ethnic minorities while adjusting for other significant clinical factors. RESULTS: No statistically significant differences in the risk of acute or chronic GVHD, TRM, or relapse were found between whites and any ethnic minority group. However, Hispanics had higher risks of treatment failure (death or relapse; relative risk [RR] = 1.30; 95% CI, 1.08 to 1.54; P = .004) and overall mortality (RR = 1.23; 95% CI, 1.03 to 1.47; P = .02). CONCLUSION: The higher risks of treatment failure and mortality among Hispanics may be the net result of modest but not statistically significant increases in both relapse and TRM and cannot be accounted for by any single transplantation-related complication.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 36 patients were treated in this phase II study (median age, 61.47 years; mean number of prior chemotherapies, 2.6; Binet stage C, n = 28). After an initial dose escalation of alemtuzumab over 3 days, alemtuzumab 30 mg and fludarabine 30 mg/m2 were administered on 3 consecutive days. Treatment was repeated after 28 days for up to six cycles. Restaging (following National Cancer Institute criteria) was carried out after cycles 2 and 4 and 1 month after the end of treatment. RESULTS: The overall response rate was 83% (11 complete responses, 19 partial responses, one stable disease, and five progressive diseases). Two patients with progressive disease developed fungal pneumonias, and one patient died as a result of Escherichia coli sepsis. Two subclinical cytomegalovirus reactivations occurred.

Such molecular modification results in sustained absorption after s.c. drug administration and a prolonged half-life. A phase I study of PEG-IFN was conducted in patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) who were previously treated with IFN-alpha to evaluate the effect of sustained exposure to IFN on patients with CML. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Twenty-seven patients with long-term or IFN-refractory CML were enrolled in cohorts of three or six patients. PEG-IFN was given once weekly by s.c. injections starting at a dose of 270 microg/wk to a maximum dose of 630 microg/wk. Sixteen additional patients were treated with escalating doses of PEG-IFN ranging from 450 to 540 microg/wk in combination with two different schedules of low-dose cytarabine (1-beta-D-arabinofuranosylcytosine, ara-C). Serial venous blood samples were collected to evaluate the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic characteristics of PEG-IFN in these patients. RESULTS: The dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) as defined by the protocol was not achieved at the highest dose tested of 630 mug/wk. With the addition of ara-C, the DLT was reached at 540 microg/wk. The safety profile was similar to that of unmodified IFNs. Of 27 patients treated with PEG-IFN, 14 (52%) achieved or maintained a complete hematologic response and three (11%) achieved a complete cytogenetic response. Among 16 patients treated with the combination of PEG-IFN and ara-C, 11 (69%) achieved or maintained complete hematologic remission and two (13%) achieved complete cytogenetic remission. The mean serum peak concentration (C(max)) of PEG-IFN increased from 9.4 to 28 ng/mL as the dose increased from 270 to 450 microg/wk, with no further increases in C(max) at higher dose levels. Serum concentration reached peak value starting about 48 hours after drug administration and was maintained at close to peak value throughout the dosing interval. The mean +/- SD area under the serum concentration-time curve (AUC) calculated after the first dose also increased from 1,022 +/- 694 to 3,343 +/- 2,728 ng hour/mL as dose was increased from 270 to 450 microg/wk, showing a dose-related increase in systemic exposure of PEG-IFN. As with C(max), the AUC did not increase at higher dose levels. The maximum induction (E(max)) of neopterin, the surrogate marker of the pharmacodynamic activity of PEG-IFN, increased from 120% to 361% over baseline values as the dose was increased from 270 to 540 microg/wk. On the once-weekly multiple dosing schedule, both the PEG-IFN and neopterin concentration seemed to reach steady state by week 5 and the steady-state values were maintained with chronic dosing over 6 months. CONCLUSION: Pegasys provided a significant advantage over standard IFN-alpha by enabling once-weekly dosing while maintaining acceptable safety, tolerability, and activity profiles. This branched 40-kDa PEG-IFN was well tolerated both as a monotherapy as well as in combination with ara-C. Demonstration of its sustained exposure, pharmacodynamic activity, hematologic response, and evidence of cytogenetic response in several patients in this limited study with either IFN-refractory or INF-intolerant patients provides a promise for further investigation in combination with new agents like imatinib.","['Talpaz, Moshe', 'Rakhit, Ashok', 'Rittweger, Karen', ""O'Brien, Susan"", 'Cortes, Jorge', 'Fettner, Scott', 'Hooftman, Leon', 'Kantarjian, Hagop']","['Talpaz M', 'Rakhit A', 'Rittweger K', ""O'Brien S"", 'Cortes J', 'Fettner S', 'Hooftman L', 'Kantarjian H']","['Department of Bioimmunotherapy and Leukemia, The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas 77030, USA. mtalpaz@mdanderson.org']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Clinical Trial, Phase I', 'Journal Article']",United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*administration & dosage/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Drug Carriers', 'Drug Combinations', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Interferon alpha-2', 'Interferon-alpha/administration & dosage/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Male', 'Maximum Tolerated Dose', 'Middle Aged', 'Polyethylene Glycols/administration & dosage/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics', 'Recombinant Proteins']",2005/09/08 09:00,2005/11/03 09:00,['2005/09/08 09:00'],"['2005/09/08 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/11/03 09:00 [medline]', '2005/09/08 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2005 Sep 1;11(17):6247-55. doi: 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-05-0882.,,"['0 (Drug Carriers)', '0 (Drug Combinations)', '0 (Interferon alpha-2)', '0 (Interferon-alpha)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '3WJQ0SDW1A (Polyethylene Glycols)', 'Q46947FE7K (peginterferon alfa-2a)']",,"['11/17/6247 [pii]', '10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-05-0882 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

DATA SOURCES: A PubMed/MEDLINE search was conducted (1966-October 2004) using the following terms: DNA methylation, myelodysplastic disorders, 5-azacytidine, and 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (decitabine). Additional data sources included bibliographies from identified articles and manufacturer information. STUDY SELECTION AND DATA EXTRACTION: Clinical trials for the treatment of various malignancies by hypomethylating agents were selected from data sources. All published, major clinical trials evaluating 5-AzaC or decitabine in myelodysplastic disorders and transformed myeloid leukemia treatment were included. DATA SYNTHESIS: Myelodysplastic disorders are a group of bone marrow stem cell hyperplasias and dysplasias that result in ineffective hematopoiesis. Myelodysplastic disorders and transformed leukemia have poor prognosis and minimal response to chemotherapy. DNA hypomethylating agents have been shown to improve overall response rates (increased neutrophil, leukocyte, and platelet counts), time to leukemic progression, and quality of life compared with supportive therapy. The incidence of the most common adverse effects (nausea, vomiting, myelosuppression) can be reduced by low-dose, continuous, or extended-interval infusion. CONCLUSIONS: Since appropriate dosing schedules of decitabine are being investigated, comparison of the clinical effectiveness of 5-AzaC and decitabine would be premature at this time. DNA hypomethylating agents show promise as monotherapies of myelodysplastic disorders and transformed leukemia and may be useful as a component of combination chemotherapy of various malignancies.","['Kuykendall, Jim R']",['Kuykendall JR'],"['Department of Biomedical and Pharmaceutical Sciences, Raabe College of Pharmacy, Ohio Northern University, Ada, OH 45810-1599, USA. j-kuykendall@onu.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Ann Pharmacother,The Annals of pharmacotherapy,9203131,IM,"['Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use', 'Azacitidine/adverse effects/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'DNA Modification Methylases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Decitabine', 'Humans', 'MEDLINE', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*drug therapy', 'Treatment Outcome']",2005/09/08 09:00,2006/01/07 09:00,['2005/09/08 09:00'],"['2005/09/08 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/01/07 09:00 [medline]', '2005/09/08 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Ann Pharmacother. 2005 Oct;39(10):1700-9. doi: 10.1345/aph.1E612.

CASE SUMMARY: A 74-year-old male with newly diagnosed acute myelogenous leukemia developed atrial fibrillation on day 12 of induction chemotherapy. He was initially treated with diltiazem 5 mg intravenously every 5-10 minutes for 5 doses and an amiodarone 150-mg loading dose intravenously. Diltiazem 30 mg orally 4 times daily and amiodarone continuous infusion were started thereafter. Amiodarone therapy was discontinued after one day due to an untoward adverse effect. The diltiazem dose was then escalated. By day 14, the patient was receiving diltiazem 120 mg orally 4 times daily. On day 15, he developed increasing abdominal distention with hyperactive bowel sounds. On day 16, a radiographic examination showed multiple dilated loops of both the small and large bowel representing possible intestinal pseudo-obstruction; diltiazem was discontinued that day. Starting on day 18, the patient showed recovery of intestinal pseudo-obstruction without intervention. No further GI complications developed during his remaining hospital course. DISCUSSION: Intestinal pseudo-obstruction is usually associated with underlying medical conditions such as trauma, infection, cardiac disease, and after surgery. Medications rarely cause such a condition. Detailed examination of the patient's record indicated neither infection nor other medications contributed to the development of intestinal pseudo-obstruction. Additionally, a radiographic examination ruled out neutropenic enterocolitis, a common gastrointestinal complication in neutropenic patients. Use of the Naranjo probability scale indicated a probable relationship between pseudo-obstruction and diltiazem in this patient. CONCLUSIONS: Although calcium-channel blockers rarely cause intestinal pseudo-obstruction, clinicians must be aware of this serious but reversible adverse effect.","['Young, Rebecca P', 'Wu, Helen']","['Young RP', 'Wu H']","['Department of Clinical Pharmacy, School of Pharmacy, University of California, San Francisco, CA 94143-0622, USA.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",United States,Ann Pharmacother,The Annals of pharmacotherapy,9203131,IM,"['Aged', 'Atrial Fibrillation/complications/drug therapy', 'Calcium Channel Blockers/administration & dosage/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Diltiazem/administration & dosage/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Gastrointestinal Motility/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Intestinal Pseudo-Obstruction/*chemically induced/complications/physiopathology', 'Male', 'Neutropenia/*complications']",2005/09/08 09:00,2006/01/07 09:00,['2005/09/08 09:00'],"['2005/09/08 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/01/07 09:00 [medline]', '2005/09/08 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Ann Pharmacother. 2005 Oct;39(10):1749-51. doi: 10.1345/aph.1G133.

Here we report that CLL cells and multiple myeloma cells are highly sensitive to brefeldin A, an inhibitor of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to Golgi protein transport currently being developed as a novel anticancer agent in a prodrug formulation. Of importance, brefeldin A effectively induced apoptosis in fludarabine-refractory CLL cells. Disruption of protein trafficking by brefeldin A caused the sequestration of the prosurvival factors APRIL and VEGF in the ER, leading to abnormal ER swelling and a decrease in VEGF secretion. Such ER stress and blockage of secretory protein traffic eventually resulted in Golgi collapse, activation of caspases, and cell death. Notably, the cellular sensitivity to this compound appeared to be independent of p53 status. Taken together, these findings suggest that malignant B cells may be highly dependent on ER-Golgi protein transport and that targeting this process may be a promising therapeutic strategy for B-cell malignancies, especially for those that respond poorly to conventional treatments.","['Carew, Jennifer S', 'Nawrocki, Steffan T', 'Krupnik, Yelena V', 'Dunner, Kenneth Jr', 'McConkey, David J', 'Keating, Michael J', 'Huang, Peng']","['Carew JS', 'Nawrocki ST', 'Krupnik YV', 'Dunner K Jr', 'McConkey DJ', 'Keating MJ', 'Huang P']","['Department of Molecular Pathology, University of Texas M.

Murine gene targeting and analysis of naturally occurring human mutations demonstrate that GATA-1 drives the maturation of committed erythroid precursors and megakaryocytes. Prior studies also suggest additional, poorly defined, roles for GATA-1 at earlier stages of erythromegakaryocytic differentiation. To investigate these functions further, we stimulated Gata1- murine embryonic stem-cell-derived hematopoietic cultures with thrombopoietin, a multistage cytokine. Initially, the cultures generated a wave of mutant megakaryocytes. However, these were rapidly overgrown by a unique population of thrombopoietin-dependent blasts that express immature markers and proliferate indefinitely. Importantly, on restoration of GATA-1 function, these cells differentiated into both erythroid and megakaryocytic lineages, suggesting that they represent bipotential progenitors. Identical cells are also present in vivo, as indicated by flow cytometry and culture analysis of fetal livers from Gata1- chimeric mice. Our findings indicate that loss of GATA-1 impairs the maturation of megakaryocyte-erythroid progenitors. This defines a new role for GATA-1 at a relatively early stage of hematopoiesis and provides potential insight into recent discoveries that human GATA1 mutations promote acute megakaryoblastic leukemia, a clonal malignancy with features of both erythroid and megakaryocyte maturation.","['Stachura, David L', 'Chou, Stella T', 'Weiss, Mitchell J']","['Stachura DL', 'Chou ST', 'Weiss MJ']","['Cell and Molecular Biology Graduate Program, The University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine, Philadelphia, PA, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Lineage', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Embryo, Mammalian/cytology', 'Erythrocytes/cytology', '*Erythropoiesis', 'GATA1 Transcription Factor/*deficiency/genetics/*physiology', 'Hematopoiesis', 'Leukemia, Megakaryoblastic, Acute/etiology', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Megakaryocytes/cytology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Mutation', 'Stem Cells', 'Thrombopoietin/pharmacology']",2005/09/08 09:00,2006/01/24 09:00,['2005/09/08 09:00'],"['2005/09/08 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/01/24 09:00 [medline]', '2005/09/08 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 2006 Jan 1;107(1):87-97. doi: 10.1182/blood-2005-07-2740.

By using oligonucleotide microarray screening, we performed gene-expression profiling on 2 subsets of patients, one comprising patients with an ""aggressive disease"" who developed blastic transformation (BT) within 3 years of diagnosis (n = 10) and, at the other extreme, patients with an ""indolent disease"" whose BT occurred 7 or more years from diagnosis (n = 9). This screening revealed 20 genes differentially expressed in patients with aggressive and indolent disease, which were validated by quantitative reverse transcriptase/polymerase chain reaction (Q-RT/PCR). A multivariate Cox regression model identified the combination of low CD7 expression with high expression of proteinase 3 or elastase as associated with longer survival in the complete cohort of 68 patients. This differential pattern of gene expression probably reflects the intrinsic heterogeneity of the disease; if so, assessing expression levels of selected genes at diagnosis may be valuable in predicting duration of survival in patients treated with imatinib and the newer tyrosine kinase inhibitors.","['Yong, Agnes S M', 'Szydlo, Richard M', 'Goldman, John M', 'Apperley, Jane F', 'Melo, Junia V']","['Yong AS', 'Szydlo RM', 'Goldman JM', 'Apperley JF', 'Melo JV']","['Department of Haematology, Imperial College London, Hammersmith Hospital, Du Cane Rd, London W12 0NN, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['*Antigens, CD34', 'Antigens, CD7/*genetics', 'Gene Expression Profiling/methods', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Genetic Variation', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/mortality/*pathology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Chronic-Phase/pathology', 'Lymphocyte Activation/genetics', 'Myeloblastin', 'Pancreatic Elastase/*genetics', 'Prognosis', 'Regression Analysis', 'Serine Endopeptidases/*genetics', 'Survival Rate']",2005/09/08 09:00,2006/01/24 09:00,['2005/09/08 09:00'],"['2005/09/08 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/01/24 09:00 [medline]', '2005/09/08 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 2006 Jan 1;107(1):205-12. doi: 10.1182/blood-2005-05-2155.

The isolated complexes are monomers, paramagnetic, and electrolytes of types 1:1 or 1:2. In both types of solid state complexes, [Cu(dien)(2a-2tzn)Y(2)] and [Cu(dienXX)(2a-2tzn)Y(2)], dien and its Schiff dibases are bonded to Cu(II) in a tridentate fashion through 3N atoms. The coordination sphere is completed by the endocyclic nitrogen of the thiazoline moiety and by two Cl, Br, or NO(3) groups with distorted octahedral geometry. The proposed structure of these compounds was supported by X-ray analysis of [Cu(dien)(Br)(2a-2tzn)](Br)(H(2)O). The coordination polyhedron around the copper atom can be described as a distorted square pyramid [Cu(dien)(Br)(2a-2tzn)](+). Its basal plane is occupied by the four nitrogen atoms of the dien and thiazoline ligands with Cu-N distances ranging between 1.996(6) and 2.032(3)A, and the axial position is occupied by one of the two bromine atoms (Br1) with a Cu1-Br1 bond distance of 2.782(1)A. The second bromine atom (Br2) is 4.694(2)A from the copper atom, which exists as a discrete anion and is responsible for the cationic nature of the complex.

Adverse prognostic factors comprise treatment resistance, cytogenetics (11q- and 17p-), the presence of unmutated Ig genes, and the more comprehensive activation marker Zap 70. In contrast to diminished sensitivity to chemotherapy, Zap 70+ B-CLL cells retain their responsiveness to manipulation of signal transduction and monoclonals. Xanthohumol (XA) has recently been documented to have an impact on breast cancer cell growth and invasiveness in vitro. Based on these observations, lymphocytes from patients with B-CLL were cultured in the presence of XA in vitro. XA induced a dose-dependent killing of B-CLL cells at an LD(50) ((24 h)) of 24.4 +/- 6.6 microM, independent of known adverse prognostic factors including functional loss of p53. Cell death was associated with poly (ADP)-ribose polymerase cleavage and annexin V positivity, suggestive of an apoptotic mechanism. Surprisingly, p 70(S 6 K) phosphorylation was stimulated upon XA treatment. In conclusion, XA has an antitumor activity on B-CLL cells in vitro.

Unique parameter estimates that avoid arbitrary constraints are provided by estimable functions of the parameter estimates. For data that are generated using equal interval widths for age and period, the identifiability issue may be expressed in terms of the age, period and cohort slopes. However, when the interval widths are not the same for age and period, additional identifiability problems arise. These may be represented in terms of macro-trends, which have the identical identifiability problem seen in the equal interval case, and micro-trends, which are the source of the additional problems. A framework for testing estimability is presented, and a variety of potentially interesting functions of the parameters considered. Unlike the equal interval case, drift is not estimable for unequal intervals, but local drift may be. In addition, the available functions for forecasting are much more restrictive in the latter case. This estimability problem induces cyclical patterns in the estimates of trend as is demonstrated using data on leukaemia in Connecticut males, but this can be avoided through the use of smoothing splines. These methods of are illustrated for three-year period and five-year age intervals using data on lung cancer mortality in Californian women.","['Holford, Theodore R']",['Holford TR'],"['Division of Biostatistics, Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, CT 06520-8034, USA. theodore.holford@yale.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Stat Med,Statistics in medicine,8215016,IM,"['Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'California/epidemiology', '*Cohort Studies', 'Connecticut/epidemiology', '*Epidemiologic Methods', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Leukemia/epidemiology', 'Lung Neoplasms/mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Models, Statistical']",2005/09/07 09:00,2006/07/21 09:00,['2005/09/07 09:00'],"['2005/09/07 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/07/21 09:00 [medline]', '2005/09/07 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Stat Med. 2006 Mar 30;25(6):977-93. doi: 10.1002/sim.2253.,['CA97432/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,['10.1002/sim.2253 [doi]'],,"['Copyright (c) 2005 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

KIT and PDGFRA mutations are rarely found in GISTs in patients with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) suggesting that the pathogenesis of GIST in NF1 patients is different from that in non-NF1 patients. Endoscopic diagnosis of GIST is usually difficult. Endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS)-guided fine-needle aspiration biopsy (EUS-FNAB) is a useful method for the diagnosis of GIST and for the detection of KIT or PDGFRA mutations.

The clinical response to imatinib therapy correlates with the types of mutations of KIT and PDGFRA, and the determination of KIT and PDGFRA mutations is useful for predicting the effect of imatinib. Resistance to imatinib after an initial response has been reported; secondary point mutations in KIT or PDGFRA that confer imatinib resistance are the most common mechanisms responsible for acquired resistance to imatinib.

Co-localization of immunofluorescent cells indicated that CD3-positive T cells, dendritic cells and macrophages were the major targets for GFP expression. These findings on the detectable in vivo expression of GFP for as long as a period of 3 months could be viewed positively for contemplating a therapeutic strategy for control of FeLV infection in the cats.","['Pan, Judong', 'Al-Dubaib, Musaad', 'Liao, Chun-Peng', 'Fujino, Yasuhito', 'Hinton, David R', 'Hayes, Kathleen A', 'Mathes, Lawrence E', 'Roy-Burman, Pradip']","['Pan J', 'Al-Dubaib M', 'Liao CP', 'Fujino Y', 'Hinton DR', 'Hayes KA', 'Mathes LE', 'Roy-Burman P']","['Department of Pathology, University of Southern California Keck School of Medicine, 2011 Zonal Avenue, HMR 210B, Los Angeles, CA 90033, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Netherlands,Vet Microbiol,Veterinary microbiology,7705469,IM,"['Animals', 'Animals, Newborn', 'Cats', '*Gene Expression', 'Gene Products, env/analysis/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Genetic Vectors/*genetics', 'Green Fluorescent Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Leukemia Virus, Feline/*genetics/*physiology', 'RNA, Viral/blood', 'Transgenes/*genetics', 'Viremia', '*Virus Replication']",2005/09/07 09:00,2005/12/15 09:00,['2005/09/07 09:00'],"['2005/02/26 00:00 [received]', '2005/07/14 00:00 [revised]', '2005/07/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2005/09/07 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/12/15 09:00 [medline]', '2005/09/07 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Vet Microbiol. 2005 Oct 31;110(3-4):181-95. doi: 10.1016/j.vetmic.2005.07.015.,['CA51485/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['0 (Gene Products, env)', '0 (RNA, Viral)', '147336-22-9 (Green Fluorescent Proteins)']",,"['S0378-1135(05)00262-2 [pii]', '10.1016/j.vetmic.2005.07.015 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The complexes were prepared by adding an aqueous solution of cerium (III) salt to an aqueous solution of the ligand subsequently raising the pH of the mixture gradually to ca. 5.0 by adding dilute solution of sodium hydroxide. The cerium (III) complexes with bis-coumarins were characterized by different physicochemical methods--elemental analysis, IR-, 1H- and 13C-NMR-spectroscopies and mass-spectral data. The spectral data of cerium (III) complexes were interpreted on the basis of comparison with the spectra of the free ligands. This analysis showed that in the Ce (III) complexes the ligands coordinated to the metal ion through both deprotonated hydroxyl groups. On the basis of the nu(C=O) red shift observed, participation of the carbonyl groups in the coordination to the metal ion was also suggested. Cytotoxic screening by MTT assay was carried out. In the present study we performed comparative evaluation of the cytotoxic effects of the two newly synthesized cerium complexes against the acute myeloid leukemia derived HL-60 and the chronic myeloid leukemia (CML)-derived BV-173. In addition the cytotoxic effects of Ce (III) complex with 3,3'-benzylidene-bis(4-hydroxy-2H-1-benzopyran-2-one) were evaluated on the CML-derived K-562 and LAMA-84 cells, characterized by relative low responsiveness to chemotherapy.

METHODS: Retrospective chart review of 9 patients who developed invasive FS compared to 8 patients who did not develop invasive FS during the study period. Presenting signs and symptoms, nasal endoscopic findings, radiographs, laboratory studies, histologic and microscopic samples, and outcomes were compared. RESULTS: Seventeen consecutive pediatric immunocompromised patients with hematologic and lymphoid neoplasms underwent nasal endoscopy and biopsy for possible FS. Nine patients were diagnosed with 10 episodes of FS; 1 patient developed FS with different organisms on 2 separate occasions separated by 6 months; 8 patients were not diagnosed with FS. Eight patients had acute myelogenous leukemia (AML); 6 patients had acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL); 1 patient had Burkitt's lymphoma, 1 patient had undifferentiated leukemia; and 1 patient had biphenotypic acute leukemia. All patients with FS had an absolute neutrophil count (ANC) 600 or less (range 0-600). All patients with FS had either persistent fevers or sinus symptoms (facial pain, nasal congestion, rhinorrhea). Sinus CT scans were abnormal in all patients with FS and without FS. Two patients with FS had maxillary sinus retention cysts. Operative endoscopic findings were helpful diagnostically when necrosis or ulceration was found. All patients in the non-FS group normalized their ANCs; 2 of the 9 patients in the FS group did not normalize their ANC. These 2 patients died from disseminated FS or from complications due to their immunosuppression. CONCLUSION/SIGNIFICANCE: All patients with FS had either persistent fevers or symptoms localized to the sinuses (facial pain, nasal congestion, or rhinorrhea). Endoscopic examination was helpful when necrosis was detected. We recommend directed biopsies of suspicious lesions, the middle and inferior turbinate, in immunocompromised, neutropenic pediatric patients with cancer who present with either persistent fevers or localizing symptoms to the sinuses. We favor the use of ""rush"" biopsies over frozen sections because of the better-quality sections and ability to perform appropriate stains.","['Park, Albert H', 'Muntz, Harlan R', 'Smith, Marshall E', 'Afify, Zeinab', 'Pysher, Theodore', 'Pavia, Andrew']","['Park AH', 'Muntz HR', 'Smith ME', 'Afify Z', 'Pysher T', 'Pavia A']","['Division of Otolaryngology--Head and Neck Surgery, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, 84132, USA. peapark@ihc.com']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg,Otolaryngology--head and neck surgery : official journal of American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery,8508176,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Alternaria/isolation & purification', 'Aspergillus/isolation & purification', 'Biopsy', 'Child', 'Cladosporium/isolation & purification', 'Endoscopy/methods', 'Female', 'Fusarium/isolation & purification', 'Humans', '*Immunocompromised Host', 'Male', 'Mycoses/*complications', 'Neoplasms/*epidemiology/*immunology', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Severity of Illness Index', 'Sinusitis/*epidemiology/*microbiology/pathology']",2005/09/07 09:00,2005/09/30 09:00,['2005/09/07 09:00'],"['2004/12/10 00:00 [received]', '2005/04/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2005/09/07 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/09/30 09:00 [medline]', '2005/09/07 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg. 2005 Sep;133(3):411-6. doi: 10.1016/j.otohns.2005.04.014.,,,,"['S0194-5998(05)00519-X [pii]', '10.1016/j.otohns.2005.04.014 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We investigated IL-22 expression in the inflamed mucosa of patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and analyzed its biologic activities in human colonic subepithelial myofibroblasts (SEMFs). METHODS: Mucosal IL-22 expression was evaluated by immunohistochemical procedures. The effects of IL-22 on colonic SEMFs were investigated by cDNA microarrays, Northern blots, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and electrophoretic gel mobility shift assays (EMSAs). RESULTS: IL-22 was not detectable in normal colonic mucosa. In IBD mucosa, IL-22 expression was detectable in CD4-positive T cells. IL-22-positive cells were increased in ulcerative colitis and even more so in Crohn's disease. IL-22 receptor expression colocalized with a marker of SEMFs. IL-22 did not modulate SEMF proliferation and collagen synthesis. cDNA microarray analyses demonstrated that, in colonic SEMFs, IL-22 increased the messenger RNA (mRNA) expression of inflammatory cytokines (IL-6, IL-8, IL-11, and leukemia inhibitory factor [LIF]), chemokines, and matrix metalloproteinases. IL-22 induced an activation of nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB and activating protein (AP)-1 within 1 hour, and a blockade of NF-kappaB and AP-1 activation markedly reduced IL-22 induction of IL-6, IL-8, IL-11, and LIF mRNA. MAP-kinase inhibitors (PD98059, U0216, and SB202190) significantly reduced IL-22 induction of cytokine secretion. The combination of either IL-17 plus IL-22 or IL-19 plus IL-22 additively up-regulated cytokine secretion. CONCLUSIONS: IL-22 derived from activated T cells acts on SEMFs to elicit expression of proinflammatory cytokines and matrix-degrading molecules indicating proinflammatory/remodeling roles in IBD.","['Andoh, Akira', 'Zhang, Zhuobin', 'Inatomi, Osamu', 'Fujino, Sanae', 'Deguchi, Yasuyuki', 'Araki, Yoshio', 'Tsujikawa, Tomoyuki', 'Kitoh, Katsuyuki', 'Kim-Mitsuyama, Shokei', 'Takayanagi, Atsushi', 'Shimizu, Nobuyoshi', 'Fujiyama, Yoshihide']","['Andoh A', 'Zhang Z', 'Inatomi O', 'Fujino S', 'Deguchi Y', 'Araki Y', 'Tsujikawa T', 'Kitoh K', 'Kim-Mitsuyama S', 'Takayanagi A', 'Shimizu N', 'Fujiyama Y']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Shiga University of Medical Science, Seta Tukinowa, Otsu, Japan. andoh@belle.shiga-med.ac.jp']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Gastroenterology,Gastroenterology,0374630,IM,"['Colon/pathology', 'Cytokines/pharmacology', 'DNA Replication/drug effects', 'Fibroblasts/drug effects/pathology', 'Gene Expression Regulation/drug effects', 'Gene Transfer Techniques', 'Humans', 'Inflammatory Bowel Diseases/genetics/immunology/*pathology', 'Interleukins/*genetics/*pharmacology/physiology', 'Intestinal Mucosa/drug effects/*pathology/physiopathology', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic']",2005/09/07 09:00,2005/10/27 09:00,['2005/09/07 09:00'],"['2005/02/17 00:00 [received]', '2005/05/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2005/09/07 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/10/27 09:00 [medline]', '2005/09/07 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Gastroenterology. 2005 Sep;129(3):969-84. doi: 10.1053/j.gastro.2005.06.071.,,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Interleukins)', 'XEO71E2E45 (interleukin-22)']",,"['S0016-5085(05)01359-4 [pii]', '10.1053/j.gastro.2005.06.071 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Patients diagnosed with RS3PE syndrome at the Medical College of Wisconsin before 1995 were telephoned and asked about their rheumatologic course since initial diagnosis of RS3PE and whether they had been diagnosed with any cancer. If so, permission was obtained to review tissue pathology. Criteria used for diagnosis of RS3PE syndrome included sudden onset of painful diffuse swelling of both hands associated with pitting edema of the dorsa of the hands without other synovitis or evidence of disease, negative rheumatoid factor, absence of radiologic abnormalities, and resolution within 6-12 months without sequelae. Data from the national SEER databank on population incidence of cancers in the appropriate sex, age, and ethnic groups for the years under study were used to assess relative risk for cancer. RESULTS: There were 10 patients for whom followup data were available. Four had a cancer diagnosed following recognition of the RS3PE syndrome; 1 patient developed non-Hodgkin's lymphoma initially diagnosed as hairy cell leukemia after 4 years; 1 developed acute lymphocytic leukemia with hyperdiploidy after 14 years; 1 was diagnosed with male breast cancer after 2.5 years; and 1 developed squamous cell lung cancer 12 months after RS3PE diagnosis. SEER data project an estimated rate of 2-3 cancers in a similar group of 10 patients of the same sex, age, and time period for this geographic area. CONCLUSION: The small sample size in this longterm followup precludes extrapolation to larger populations but suggests that there may be a slightly higher than expected rate of neoplasia in patients diagnosed with RS3PE syndrome. The interval between onset of RS3PE syndrome and diagnosis of cancer was fairly long, indicating that patients should be monitored for neoplasia with prudent age and sex specific surveillance for an extended period after diagnosis with RS3PE.","['Russell, Elizabeth B']",['Russell EB'],"['Division of Rheumatology, Department of Medicine, Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, Wisconsin, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",Canada,J Rheumatol,The Journal of rheumatology,7501984,IM,"['Age Distribution', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Cohort Studies', 'Edema/*diagnosis', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Male', 'Paraneoplastic Syndromes/*diagnosis/*epidemiology', 'Precancerous Conditions/epidemiology/*pathology', 'Risk Assessment', 'SEER Program', 'Serologic Tests', 'Severity of Illness Index', 'Sex Distribution', 'Surveys and Questionnaires', 'Syndrome', 'Synovitis/*diagnosis']",2005/09/06 09:00,2005/11/16 09:00,['2005/09/06 09:00'],"['2005/09/06 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/11/16 09:00 [medline]', '2005/09/06 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Rheumatol. 2005 Sep;32(9):1760-1.,,,,['0315162X-32-1760 [pii]'],,,,,,,"['J Rheumatol. 2006 Nov;33(11):2365-6; author reply 2366.

These patients represent a therapeutic challenge for which no current treatment approach is satisfactory. Therefore, a large number of genetic studies using cytogenetic molecular techniques have been performed to better define the chromosomal abnormalities in this poor-prognosis group. On the basis of the available data from several studies of AML with complex karyotypes, similar findings on recurrent breakpoints and frequently lost and gained chromosomal regions have been observed. The most frequent rearrangements, in all the published series, were unbalanced translocations leading to loss of chromosomal material. Overall, loss of 5q and/or 7q chromosomal material seemed the more common event, and losses of 5q, 7q, and 17p in combination were observed in many cases. Overrepresented chromosomal material from 8q, 11q23, 21q and 22q was found recurrently and in several cases this was due to the amplification of the MLL (located at 11q23) and AML1/RUNX1 (located at 22q22) genes. As a result of these findings, the presence of MLL copy gain/amplifications or losses of the short arm of chromosome 17, in association with 5/5q, have been found to be indicators of an extremely poor prognosis. Interestingly, this non-random pattern of DNA gains and losses, that characterizes AML cases with complex karyotypes, affects the gene expression pattern, and a specific expression profile, characterized by the upregulation of genes involved in the DNA repair and chromosome segregation pathways, has been recently reported. Therefore, a comprehensive genome-wide analysis of patients with AML or MDS with complex karyotypes has led to a better characterization of chromosomal aberrations. These specific alterations could be used in the near future as therapeutic targets or markers for the risk stratification of patients, detection of minimal residual disease and the development of new therapeutic interventions.","['Alvarez, Sara', 'Cigudosa, Juan C']","['Alvarez S', 'Cigudosa JC']","['Cytogenetics Unit, Centro Nacional de de Investigaciones Oncologicas (CNIO), Madrid, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",England,Hematol Oncol,Hematological oncology,8307268,IM,"['Chromosome Segregation/genetics', 'Chromosomes, Human/*genetics/metabolism', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit/genetics/metabolism', 'DNA Repair/genetics', 'Gene Amplification/genetics', 'Gene Expression Profiling/methods', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/*genetics', 'Genome, Human/genetics', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/metabolism/therapy', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*genetics/metabolism/therapy', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/genetics/metabolism', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Neoplasm, Residual/genetics/metabolism/therapy', 'Risk Factors', '*Translocation, Genetic']",2005/09/06 09:00,2006/01/04 09:00,['2005/09/06 09:00'],"['2005/09/06 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/01/04 09:00 [medline]', '2005/09/06 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Hematol Oncol. 2005 Mar;23(1):18-25. doi: 10.1002/hon.744.,,"['0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (KMT2A protein, human)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (RUNX1 protein, human)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)']",53,['10.1002/hon.744 [doi]'],,"['Copyright 2005 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Ten commonly occurring oxysterols (7alpha-, 7beta-hydroxycholesterol, 7-ketocholesterol, 19-hydroxycholesterol, cholesterol-5alpha,6alpha-epoxide, cholesterol-5beta,6beta-epoxide, 22R-, 22S-, 25-, and 27-hydroxycholesterol) were studied for both their cytotoxicity and their ability to induce superoxide anion production (O2*-) and IL-8 secretion in U937 human promonocytic leukemia cells.

The highest capacity to simultaneously stimulate IL-8 secretion (quantified by ELISA and by using a multiplexed, particle-based flow cytometric assay) and enhance IL-8 mRNA levels (determined by RT-PCR) was observed with 7beta-hydroxycholesterol and 25-hydroxycholesterol. None of the effects observed for the oxysterols were detected for cholesterol.

In most of these cells AgNORs appeared as clusters of silver stained particles distributed in the whole nucleolar body. On the other hand, in some leukemic early granulocytic precursors, i.e., in myeloblasts and promyelocytes enlarged AgNORs were translocated in the nucleolar peripheral part. In addition, the number of translocated AgNORs at the nucleolar periphery was significantly smaller. Such translocation of a reduced number of AgNORs was easily produced by experimental aging, i.e., starving of cultured leukemic early granulocytic precursors (HL-60 and K562 cells) in vitro and seems to be reversible. Similar translocation of a reduced number of AgNORs was also produced by aging of leukemic plasmacytic precursors. Thus, the translocation of the reduced number of AgNORs to the nucleolar periphery in some blastic leukemic hematopoietic cells might be an useful marker of their aging at the single cell level.

While thymidine is in itself an inhibitor of DNA replication, thymidine blocks are typically used to generate cell synchrony at the G1/S boundary. We have previously presented the first evidence that shows the growth imbalance and altered expression levels of cyclins A, B1, D3 and E in MOLT-4 cells synchronized in the cell cycle by thymidine. The major objective of the present study was to compare the levels of cyclins A, B1, D3 and E in G1 phase of the cell cycle between synchronized and unperturbed asynchronously growing human lymphocyte leukemia MOLT-4 cells. Here, we demonstrate that the sorted, asynchronously growing MOLT-4 cells had considerably lower levels of cyclins A, B1, D3 and E than their counterparts of the cells arrested in G1/S phase, as assessed by flow cytometry. In addition, we confirmed these results by using post-sorting Western blotting, a new method we recently developed for examining protein expression in specific phases of sorted, synchronized or asynchronously growing cells. Our findings revealed that the levels of cyclins D3 and E in the asynchronously growing MOLT-4 cells were significantly lower than those in synchronized cultures. Interestingly, protein expression levels of cyclins A and B1 in the asynchronously growing MOLT-4 cells were barely measurable, suggesting that these proteins were either not expressed or under detectable levels. These studies indicate that our synchronization protocol may have disturbed cell proliferation and metabolism as evidenced by significant differences in the expression of cyclins between asynchronously growing and synchronized cells, and further suggest that the levels of cyclins A, B1, D3 and E in synchronized cultures cannot represent those in unperturbed, asynchronously growing cells. Thus, it appears that thymidine-treated, synchronized cells may not be suitable experimental models for the study of normal cell cycle.","['Yu, Chunzhao', 'Hu, Junbo', 'Feng, Yongdong', 'Tao, Deding', 'Wu, Jianhong', 'Qin, Jichao', 'Liu, Shuangyou', 'Zhang, Manchao', 'Wang, Gangduo', 'Li, Xiping', 'Zhao, Jinshun', 'Ding, Hong', 'Reed, Eddie', 'Li, Qingdi Q', 'Gong, Jianping']","['Yu C', 'Hu J', 'Feng Y', 'Tao D', 'Wu J', 'Qin J', 'Liu S', 'Zhang M', 'Wang G', 'Li X', 'Zhao J', 'Ding H', 'Reed E', 'Li QQ', 'Gong J']","['Center for Cancer Research, and Department of Surgery, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Central China University of Science and Technology, Wuhan 430030, PR China.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Greece,Int J Mol Med,International journal of molecular medicine,9810955,IM,"['Blotting, Western', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects/genetics/*physiology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cyclin A/analysis', 'Cyclin B/analysis', 'Cyclin B1', 'Cyclin D3', 'Cyclin E/analysis', 'Cyclins/*analysis', 'DNA, Neoplasm/analysis/genetics', 'Flow Cytometry', '*G1 Phase', 'Humans', 'Thymidine/pharmacology']",2005/09/06 09:00,2005/12/22 09:00,['2005/09/06 09:00'],"['2005/09/06 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/12/22 09:00 [medline]', '2005/09/06 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Int J Mol Med. 2005 Oct;16(4):645-51.,,"['0 (CCNB1 protein, human)', '0 (CCND3 protein, human)', '0 (Cyclin A)', '0 (Cyclin B)', '0 (Cyclin B1)', '0 (Cyclin D3)', '0 (Cyclin E)', '0 (Cyclins)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', 'VC2W18DGKR (Thymidine)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Healthy volunteers (n=43) were used as positive controls. S-TK1 concentration was determined by ECL dot blot assay and STK activity levels by an RIA assay. S-TK1 concentrations and STK activity levels in preoperative malignant patients were significantly higher than in healthy individuals, in patients with benign tumors and in those with non-cancerous diseases. Significant correlations between concentration and activity level were only found in healthy individuals, in patients with benign tumors, and in some patients with malignancies, i.e. leukaemia, and breast and gastric cancers. About 90-95 percent of the malignant patients showed S-TK1 concentrations above those of the healthy controls. The corresponding value for STK activity was about 75 percent. When sera from malignant patients were diluted with sera from healthy individuals, S-TK1 concentrations and STK activity levels decreased more than expected. This indicates the presence of a compound (or compounds) in the serum of healthy individuals that destabilises S-TK1.

FASAY distinguishes yeast colonies expressing functional p53 protein from colonies producing a dysfunctional p53 protein simply on the basis of color. We analyzed the p53 status of 26 human cell lines of different tissue origin using the functional assay in yeast. Wild-type p53 was found in six cell lines and various p53 aberrations in the remaining twenty. FASAY detected temperature-sensitive p53 mutations in breast cancer cell line, BT474, and leiomyosarcoma cell line, SK-LMS-1, and two independent p53 point mutations in SK-UT-1 and SK-LMS-1 leiomyosarcoma cell lines. In addition, the assay revealed that a recombination occurred between the two mutated p53 alleles producing a stable ratio of p53 wild-type alleles (11.7 or 2.7% respectively). In the case of acute myeloid leukemia cell line, ML-1, we detected both wild-type and heterozygous p53 status, depending on the source of the cell line. In Hs913T, HL60 and Saos-2 cell lines, FASAY failed to assess p53 status due to a large deletion/rearrangement of the p53 gene.

Both compounds display remarkable activity in malignancies arising from the clonal expansion of lymphocytes, and particularly in B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL). These analogs are prodrugs that must be converted into their respective nucleotides as an essential requirement for cytotoxicity. Triphosphate analogs inhibit various processes involved in DNA and RNA synthesis. Moreover, the effect of nucleoside analogs in leukemic cells may involve modulation of apoptosis pathways, cell-cycle control, or signal transduction pathways. These findings are of crucial importance because alterations in these pathways may be involved in leukemic cell resistance toward nucleoside analogs and, hence, constitute new molecular targets to sensitize leukemic cells to these drugs.","['Van den Neste, Eric', 'Cardoen, Sabine', 'Offner, Fritz', 'Bontemps, Francoise']","['Van den Neste E', 'Cardoen S', 'Offner F', 'Bontemps F']","['Laboratory of Physiological Chemistry, Christian de Duve Institute of Cellular Pathology, UCL-ICP 7539, 1200 Brussels, Belgium. vandenneste@sang.ucl.ac.be']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",Greece,Int J Oncol,International journal of oncology,9306042,IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Cell Cycle', 'Cell Membrane/metabolism', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cell Survival', 'Cladribine/*pharmacology', 'DNA/chemistry/metabolism', 'DNA Damage', 'DNA Repair', 'DNA-Directed DNA Polymerase/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/drug therapy', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*drug therapy', 'Models, Biological', 'Models, Chemical', 'Nucleosides/*pharmacology', 'RNA/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/metabolism', 'Vidarabine/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology']",2005/09/06 09:00,2006/02/01 09:00,['2005/09/06 09:00'],"['2005/09/06 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/02/01 09:00 [medline]', '2005/09/06 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Int J Oncol. 2005 Oct;27(4):1113-24.,,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Nucleosides)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '47M74X9YT5 (Cladribine)', '63231-63-0 (RNA)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 2.7.7.7 (DNA-Directed DNA Polymerase)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'P2K93U8740 (fludarabine)']",165,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Multiple myeloma (MM) and monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) are the most common monoclonal gammopathies. Despite advances in systemic and supportive therapies, MM is an incurable hematological malignancy with a median survival of between two and three years. Point mutations in the Ras genes can be detected in a variety of human malignancies, indicating that ras activation represents a widespread oncogenic event. Several studies have analysed the incidence of Ras mutation in MM and MGUS with great differences in their results. To date, the etiopathogenesis of these diseases is still unknown and the relevance of Ras mutation to the clinical and biological behaviour of monoclonal gammopathies remains to be elucidated. In this study, we have analysed K-ras codon 12 and N-ras codon 61 mutations on anti-CD138 sorted bone marrow plasma cell samples of 44 cases of monoclonal gammopathies: 30 MM, 13 MGUS and 1 plasma cell leukaemia, using polymerase chain reaction.

In the present study, we investigated the role of the transcription factor NF-kappaB in TPA-induced growth inhibition and apoptosis in the myeloid leukemia HL-60 cell line and its TPA-resistant cell variant HL-525. Unlike the parental cell line, HL-525 cells are protein kinase C (PKC)-beta deficient and resistant to TPA-induced differentiation and apoptosis. We found that treatment of HL-60 cells with TPA resulted in a concentration-dependent growth inhibition and an increase in apoptotic cells. TPA only had a small effect on growth and apoptosis in HL-525 cells. Treatment of HL-60 cells with TPA (0.64-3.2 nM) caused a rapid activation of NF-kappaB as determined by electrophoresis mobility shift assay (EMSA) and immunocytochemistry. Although the basal level of NF-kappaB activity was low in HL-60 cells, TPA-resistant HL-525 cells had a high basal level of NF-kappaB activity. Treatment of HL-525 cells with higher concentrations of TPA (16-80 nM) resulted in a further increase in NF-kappaB activity. (E)3-[(4-methylphenyl)-sulfonyl]-2-propenenitrile (BAY 11-7082; BAY), which inhibits IkappaB alpha phosphorylation and thus decreases NF-kappaB activation, was found to decrease TPA-induced nuclear translocation of NF-kappaB. Furthermore, BAY enhanced TPA-induced growth inhibition and apoptosis in both HL-60 and HL-525 cells. Results from the present study indicate that inhibition of NF-kappaB by BAY was associated with enhanced TPA-induced growth inhibition and apoptosis in human myeloid leukemia cells. TPA in combination with pharmacological inhibitors of NF-kappaB may improve the therapeutic efficacy of TPA and overcome the resistance to TPA in some myeloid leukemia patients.","['Hansson, Annette', 'Marin, Yari E', 'Suh, Junghan', 'Rabson, Arnold B', 'Chen, Suzie', 'Huberman, Eliezer', 'Chang, Richard L', 'Conney, Allan H', 'Zheng, Xi']","['Hansson A', 'Marin YE', 'Suh J', 'Rabson AB', 'Chen S', 'Huberman E', 'Chang RL', 'Conney AH', 'Zheng X']","['Susan Lehman Cullman Laboratory for Cancer Research, Department of Chemical Biology, Ernest Mario School of Pharmacy, Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey, Piscataway, NJ 08854, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Greece,Int J Oncol,International journal of oncology,9306042,IM,"['Active Transport, Cell Nucleus', '*Apoptosis', 'Cell Adhesion', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Nucleus/metabolism', 'Cell Proliferation/*drug effects', 'Cell Survival', 'DNA/chemistry', 'DNA Damage', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'I-kappa B Proteins/metabolism', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*drug therapy', 'NF-KappaB Inhibitor alpha', 'NF-kappa B/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Nitriles/*pharmacology', 'Phosphorylation', 'Propidium/pharmacology', 'Protein Kinase C/metabolism', 'Protein Kinase C beta', 'Sulfones/*pharmacology', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/*pharmacology', 'Time Factors']",2005/09/06 09:00,2006/02/01 09:00,['2005/09/06 09:00'],"['2005/09/06 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/02/01 09:00 [medline]', '2005/09/06 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Int J Oncol. 2005 Oct;27(4):941-8.,"['CA 092268/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 80826/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['0 (3-(4-methylphenylsulfonyl)-2-propenenitrile)', '0 (I-kappa B Proteins)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (NFKBIA protein, human)', '0 (Nitriles)', '0 (Sulfones)', '139874-52-5 (NF-KappaB Inhibitor alpha)', '36015-30-2 (Propidium)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C beta)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, combined treatment of cells with VK2 plus 1alpha,25-dihydroxy vitamin D3 (VD3) resulted in suppression of VK2-inducing apoptosis and pronounced induction of monocytic differentiation as compared with that by VD3 alone. After achieving monocytic differentiation by pre-exposure to VK2 and VD3, the cells became resistant to various apoptotic stimuli including VK2- and H2O2-treatment and serum deprivation. Accumulation of cytoplasm p21CIP1 along with disappearance of nuclear p21CIP1 was detected in cells in response to 96-h treatment with VK2 plus VD3. A stable transfectant, U937-deltaNLS-p21CIP1, which lacked the nuclear localization signal of p21CIP1 and showed overexpression of cytoplasm p21CIP1 without monocytic differentiation, was resistant to apoptosis. These data suggest that a change of intracellular distribution of p21CIP1 from nucleus to cytoplasm along with differentiation appears to be anti-apoptotic. Clinical benefits of using VK2 for treatment of patients with leukemia and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) have been reported. Our data suggest that VK2 plus VD3 may be an effective combination for differentiation-based therapy for leukemia and also MDS whose cytopenias are mediated though apoptosis.","['Iguchi, Tomotaka', 'Miyazawa, Keisuke', 'Asada, Minoru', 'Gotoh, Akihiko', 'Mizutani, Shuki', 'Ohyashiki, Kazuma']","['Iguchi T', 'Miyazawa K', 'Asada M', 'Gotoh A', 'Mizutani S', 'Ohyashiki K']","['First Department of Internal Medicine, Tokyo Medical University, Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Greece,Int J Oncol,International journal of oncology,9306042,IM,"['*Apoptosis', 'Calcitriol/*pharmacology', 'Cell Cycle', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Nucleus/metabolism', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cholecalciferol/metabolism', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21/*metabolism', 'Cytoplasm/metabolism', 'Flow Cytometry', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Hydrogen Peroxide/pharmacology', 'Immunoblotting', 'Immunoprecipitation', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy', 'MAP Kinase Kinase 4/metabolism', 'Models, Biological', 'Monocytes/cytology', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/pathology', 'Time Factors', 'Transfection', 'U937 Cells', 'Vitamin K 2/*pharmacology']",2005/09/06 09:00,2006/02/01 09:00,['2005/09/06 09:00'],"['2005/09/06 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/02/01 09:00 [medline]', '2005/09/06 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Int J Oncol. 2005 Oct;27(4):893-900.,,"['0 (CDKN1A protein, human)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21)', '11032-49-8 (Vitamin K 2)', '1C6V77QF41 (Cholecalciferol)', 'BBX060AN9V (Hydrogen Peroxide)', 'EC 2.7.12.2 (MAP Kinase Kinase 4)', 'FXC9231JVH (Calcitriol)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

With use of aggressive chemotherapy which includes intermediate or high dose methotrexate, the incidence of testicular relapses has declined. However once these patients have received cranial irradiation as a part of the front line protocol, high dose methotrexate needs to be avoided because of risk of developing leucoencephalopathy. AIM: To study the use of non cross resistant chemotherapeutic agents along with a regimen containing lower doses of methotrexate in patients of isolated testicular relapse (ITR). MATERIALS AND METHODS: This is a retrospective analysis of 12 consecutive patients with ITR treated with modified version of the CCG-112 protocol which consists of intensive systemic chemotherapy, cranial chemoprophylaxis along with testicular irradiation. RESULTS: One patient died of regimen related toxicity. Two patients relapsed in the bone marrow during maintenance. Of the nine patients who completed treatment, eight are alive and in remission. One patient had a bone marrow relapse two months after completing treatment. The Kaplan Meier estimates give us an Event Free Survival (EFS) of 66.7% at 10 yrs.

Further, transplantation of isolated EGFP-positive/vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-3-positive (EGFP+/VEGFR-3+) or EGFP+/VEGFR-2+ cell populations resulted in incorporation of EGFP+ cells into the newly formed lymphatic vessels. EGFP+/CEPCs were also present in peritumoral lymphatic vessels of a fibrosarcoma.

The molecular mechanisms involved in the modulation and recruitment of BM endothelium are largely unknown and may provide novel therapeutic targets for neoplastic diseases. We observed that angiogenic stimulation of BM endothelial cells activates mTOR and engages its downstream pathways 4E-BP1 and S6K1, which are inhibited by the mTOR-specific blockers rapamycin and CCI-779. Both mTOR blockers significantly inhibit growth factor- and leukemia-induced proliferation of BM endothelium by inducing G0/G1 cell-cycle arrest. This effect is associated with down-regulation of cyclin D1 and cdk2 phosphorylation, and up-regulation of the cdk inhibitors p27(kip1) and p21(cip1). Under conditions that reproduce the biomechanical fluidic environment of the BM, CCI-779 is equally effective in inhibiting BM endothelial-cell proliferation. Finally, simultaneous blockade of mTOR and NF-kappaB pathways synergize to significantly inhibit or abrogate the proliferative responses of BM endothelial cells to mitogenic stimuli. This study identifies mTOR as an important pathway for the proangiogenic stimulation of BM endothelium. Modulation of this pathway may serve as a valid therapeutic intervention in BM malignancies evolving in association with an angiogenic phenotype.","['Costa, Lara F', 'Balcells, Mercedes', 'Edelman, Elazer R', 'Nadler, Lee M', 'Cardoso, Angelo A']","['Costa LF', 'Balcells M', 'Edelman ER', 'Nadler LM', 'Cardoso AA']","['Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02115, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Adult', 'Bone Marrow/*blood supply', 'Cell Cycle', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Child', 'Cyclin D1/metabolism', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 2/metabolism', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21/genetics', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p27/genetics', 'Endothelium/cytology/*physiology', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Humans', 'NF-kappa B/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism/*physiology', 'Neovascularization, Pathologic/*etiology', 'Phosphorylation', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/blood', 'Protein Kinases/metabolism/*physiology', 'TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases']",2005/09/06 09:00,2006/01/24 09:00,['2005/09/06 09:00'],"['2005/09/06 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/01/24 09:00 [medline]', '2005/09/06 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 2006 Jan 1;107(1):285-92. doi: 10.1182/blood-2005-06-2208.

Coadministration of subtoxic or marginally toxic concentrations of 2-ME and SAHA or sodium butyrate in diverse human leukemia-cell types resulted in a marked increase in oxidative damage (eg, generation of reactive oxygen species [ROSs]), mitochondrial injury (eg, cytochrome c release and Bax translocation), caspase activation, and apoptosis. These interactions were also noted in primary human leukemia cells but not in normal bone marrow CD34+ cells. Synergistic interactions between these agents were associated with inactivation of Akt and activation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK). Essentially all of these events were reversed by free radical scavengers such as the manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD) mimetic TBAP and catalase. Notably, treatment with 2-ME/HDACIs resulted in down-regulation of thioredoxin, MnSOD, and glutathione peroxidase. Enforced activation of Akt blocked 2-ME/HDACI-mediated mitochondrial injury, caspase activation, and JNK up-regulation, but not generation of ROSs. Pharmacologic or genetic (siRNA) interruption of the JNK pathway also significantly attenuated the lethality of this regimen. Together, these findings support a model in which antileukemic synergism between 2-ME and HDACIs stems primarily from induction of oxidative damage, leading in turn to Akt inactivation and JNK activation, culminating in mitochondrial injury and apoptosis. They also raise the possibility that these events may preferentially occur in leukemic versus normal hematopoietic cells.","['Gao, Ning', 'Rahmani, Mohamed', 'Shi, Xianglin', 'Dent, Paul', 'Grant, Steven']","['Gao N', 'Rahmani M', 'Shi X', 'Dent P', 'Grant S']","['Department of Medicine, Virginia Commonwealth University/Medical College of Virginia, Richmond, VA, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Down-Regulation', 'Drug Synergism', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Estradiol/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Free Radical Scavengers/pharmacology', '*Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors', 'Humans', 'JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/drug effects', 'Leukemia/drug therapy/pathology', 'Mitochondria/pathology', 'Oncogene Protein v-akt/*drug effects', 'Oxidative Stress/*drug effects']",2005/09/06 09:00,2006/01/24 09:00,['2005/09/06 09:00'],"['2005/09/06 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/01/24 09:00 [medline]', '2005/09/06 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 2006 Jan 1;107(1):241-9. doi: 10.1182/blood-2005-06-2409.

Likewise, acute lymphoblastic leukemia cells are typically arrested at early stages of B cell development. We therefore investigated BTK function in B cell precursor leukemia cells carrying a BCR-ABL1, E2A-PBX1, MLL-AF4, TEL-AML1, or TEL-PDGFRB gene rearrangement. Although somatic mutations of the BTK gene are rare in B cell precursor leukemia cells, we identified kinase-deficient splice variants of BTK throughout all leukemia subtypes. Unlike infant leukemia cells carrying an MLL-AF4 gene rearrangement, where expression of full-length BTK was detectable in only four of eight primary cases, in leukemia cells harboring other fusion genes full-length BTK was typically coexpressed with kinase-deficient variants. As shown by overexpression experiments, kinase-deficient splice variants can act as a dominant-negative BTK in that they suppress BTK-dependent differentiation and pre-B cell receptor responsiveness of the leukemia cells. On the other hand, induced expression of full-length BTK rendered the leukemia cells particularly sensitive to apoptosis. Comparing BTK expression in surviving or preapoptotic leukemia cells after 10-Gy gamma radiation, we observed selective survival of leukemia cells that exhibit expression of dominant-negative BTK forms. These findings indicate that lack of BTK expression or expression of dominant-negative splice variants in B cell precursor leukemia cells can (i) inhibit differentiation beyond the pre-B cell stage and (ii) protect from radiation-induced apoptosis.","['Feldhahn, Niklas', 'Rio, Paula', 'Soh, Bonaventure Ndikung Bejeng', 'Liedtke, Stefanie', 'Sprangers, Mieke', 'Klein, Florian', 'Wernet, Peter', 'Jumaa, Hassan', 'Hofmann, Wolf-Karsten', 'Hanenberg, Helmut', 'Rowley, Janet D', 'Muschen, Markus']","['Feldhahn N', 'Rio P', 'Soh BN', 'Liedtke S', 'Sprangers M', 'Klein F', 'Wernet P', 'Jumaa H', 'Hofmann WK', 'Hanenberg H', 'Rowley JD', 'Muschen M']","[""Laboratory for Molecular Stem Cell Biology, Institute for Transplantation Diagnostics and Cell Therapeutics, and Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Children's Hospital, Heinrich-Heine-Universitat, 40225 Dusseldorf, Germany.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,IM,"['Agammaglobulinaemia Tyrosine Kinase', 'Alternative Splicing', 'Apoptosis/radiation effects', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Survival', 'Gamma Rays', 'Gene Rearrangement', 'Humans', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutation', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*enzymology/genetics/pathology', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*deficiency/genetics/physiology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2005/09/06 09:00,2005/11/10 09:00,['2005/09/06 09:00'],"['2005/09/06 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/11/10 09:00 [medline]', '2005/09/06 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2005 Sep 13;102(37):13266-71. doi: 10.1073/pnas.0505196102.

The gene defective in a subset of RTS cases, RECQL4, encodes a member of the RecQ family of DNA helicases. To better define the function of the RECQL4 protein, we have determined its subcellular localization. We have raised antibodies against the N- and C-terminal parts of RECQL4 and could show that in various human cells endogenous RECQL4 forms discrete nuclear foci that colocalize with promyelotic leukaemia protein (PML). The number of foci and their colocalization with PML does not significantly change after induction of different types of DNA damages. Silencing of RECQL4 expression by siRNA causes a significant reduction in RECQL4 nuclear foci formation. Furthermore, we demonstrate that RECQL4 foci coincide with foci formed by human Rad51 and regions of single-stranded DNA after induction of DNA double-strand breaks. In agreement with this, we also show that RECQL4 and Rad51 form a complex in human cells. Our findings suggest a role for RECQL4 in the repair of DNA double-strand breaks by homologous recombination and shed new light onto RECQL4's function in human cells.","['Petkovic, Maja', 'Dietschy, Tobias', 'Freire, Raimundo', 'Jiao, Renjie', 'Stagljar, Igor']","['Petkovic M', 'Dietschy T', 'Freire R', 'Jiao R', 'Stagljar I']","['Institute of Vet.

DNA adducts were measured in a case-control study nested in the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC) investigation. Cases included newly diagnosed lung cancer (n = 115), upper respiratory cancers (pharynx and larynx; n = 82), bladder cancer (n = 124), leukemia (n = 166), and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or emphysema deaths (n = 77) accrued after a median follow-up of 7 years among the EPIC former smokers and never-smokers. Three controls per case were matched for questionnaire analyses and two controls per case for laboratory analyses. Matching criteria were gender, age, smoking status, country of recruitment, and follow-up time. Individual exposure to air pollution was assessed using concentration data from monitoring stations in routine air quality monitoring networks. Leukocyte DNA adducts were analyzed blindly using 32P postlabeling technique. Adducts were associated with the subsequent risk of lung cancer, with an odds ratio (OR) of 1.86 [95% confidence interval (95% CI), 0.88-3.93] when comparing detectable versus nondetectable adducts. The association with lung cancer was stronger in never-smokers (OR, 4.04; 95% CI, 1.06-15.42) and among the younger age groups. After exclusion of the cancers occurring in the first 36 months of follow-up, the OR was 4.16 (95% CI, 1.24-13.88). A positive association was found between DNA adducts and ozone (O3) concentration. Our prospective study suggests that leukocyte DNA adducts may predict lung cancer risk of never-smokers. Besides, the association of DNA adduct levels with O3 indicates a possible role for photochemical smog in determining DNA damage.","['Peluso, Marco', 'Munnia, Armelle', 'Hoek, Gerard', 'Krzyzanowski, Michal', 'Veglia, Fabrizio', 'Airoldi, Luisa', 'Autrup, Herman', 'Dunning, Alison', 'Garte, Seymour', 'Hainaut, Pierre', 'Malaveille, Christian', 'Gormally, Emmanuelle', 'Matullo, Giuseppe', 'Overvad, Kim', 'Raaschou-Nielsen, Ole', 'Clavel-Chapelon, Francoise', 'Linseisen, Jacob', 'Boeing, Heiner', 'Trichopoulou, Antonia', 'Trichopoulos, Dimitrios', 'Kaladidi, Anna', 'Palli, Domenico', 'Krogh, Vittorio', 'Tumino, Rosario', 'Panico, Salvatore', 'Bueno-De-Mesquita, H Bas', 'Peeters, Petra H', 'Kumle, Merethe', 'Gonzalez, Carlos A', 'Martinez, Carmen', 'Dorronsoro, Miren', 'Barricarte, Aurelio', 'Navarro, Carmen', 'Quiros, J Ramon', 'Berglund, Goran', 'Janzon, Lars', 'Jarvholm, Bengt', 'Day, Nicholas E', 'Key, Tim J', 'Saracci, Rodolfo', 'Kaaks, Rudolf', 'Riboli, Elio', 'Vineis, Paolo']","['Peluso M', 'Munnia A', 'Hoek G', 'Krzyzanowski M', 'Veglia F', 'Airoldi L', 'Autrup H', 'Dunning A', 'Garte S', 'Hainaut P', 'Malaveille C', 'Gormally E', 'Matullo G', 'Overvad K', 'Raaschou-Nielsen O', 'Clavel-Chapelon F', 'Linseisen J', 'Boeing H', 'Trichopoulou A', 'Trichopoulos D', 'Kaladidi A', 'Palli D', 'Krogh V', 'Tumino R', 'Panico S', 'Bueno-De-Mesquita HB', 'Peeters PH', 'Kumle M', 'Gonzalez CA', 'Martinez C', 'Dorronsoro M', 'Barricarte A', 'Navarro C', 'Quiros JR', 'Berglund G', 'Janzon L', 'Jarvholm B', 'Day NE', 'Key TJ', 'Saracci R', 'Kaaks R', 'Riboli E', 'Vineis P']","['Cancer Risk Factor Branch, CSPO-Scientific Institute of Tuscany Region, Florence, Italy. m.peluso@cspo.it']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Case-Control Studies', 'DNA Adducts/*blood', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Lung Neoplasms/*blood/genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'Prospective Studies', 'Risk Factors']",2005/09/06 09:00,2005/11/16 09:00,['2005/09/06 09:00'],"['2005/09/06 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/11/16 09:00 [medline]', '2005/09/06 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 2005 Sep 1;65(17):8042-8. doi: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-04-3488.,,['0 (DNA Adducts)'],,"['65/17/8042 [pii]', '10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-04-3488 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To our surprise, TRAIL induced simultaneous apoptosis and proliferation in group AP cells. More than 20% of all cells tested belonged to group P and showed TRAIL-mediated proliferation even in the presence of certain cytotoxic drugs but not inhibitors of nuclear factor-kappaB.

Recent studies have indicated that combinatorial use of retinoid and nonretinoid compounds, such as histone deacetylase inhibitors, arsenics, and PKA agonists, has higher therapeutic value in this disease and potentially in other malignancies. In a screen of 370 compounds, we identified benzodithiophene analogues as potent enhancers of ATRA-induced APL cell differentiation. These effects were not associated with changes in global histone acetylation and, for the most potent compounds, were exerted at very low nanomolar concentrations, and were paralleled by enhancement of some, but not all, ATRA-modulated gene expressions. Investigating the mechanism underlying the effects of these drugs on ATRA-induced APL cell differentiation, we have shown that benzodithiophenes enhance ATRA-mediated dissociation and association of corepressor N-CoR and coactivator p300 acetyltransferase, respectively, with retinoic acid receptor (RAR) alpha proteins. These data suggest that benzodithiophenes act at the level of receptor activation, possibly by affecting posttranslational modification of the receptor (and/or coregulators), thus leading to an enhancement in ATRA-mediated effects on gene expression and APL cell differentiation. Given the specificities of these low benzodithiophene concentrations for PML-RARalpha and RARalpha, these drugs may be useful for combinatorial differentiation therapy of APL and possibly other acute myelogenous leukemia subtypes in which the overall ATRA signaling is suppressed.","['Xu, Ke', 'Guidez, Fabien', 'Glasow, Annegret', 'Chung, Danna', 'Petrie, Kevin', 'Stegmaier, Kimberly', 'Wang, Kan-Kan', 'Zhang, Ji', 'Jing, Yongkui', 'Zelent, Arthur', 'Waxman, Samuel']","['Xu K', 'Guidez F', 'Glasow A', 'Chung D', 'Petrie K', 'Stegmaier K', 'Wang KK', 'Zhang J', 'Jing Y', 'Zelent A', 'Waxman S']","['Section of Hemato-Oncology, Institute of Cancer Research, London, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,IM,"['Cell Differentiation/*drug effects', 'Drug Synergism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*drug therapy/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Receptors, Retinoic Acid/*metabolism', 'Repressor Proteins/*metabolism', 'Retinoic Acid Receptor alpha', 'Thiophenes/*pharmacology', 'Transfection', 'Tretinoin/*pharmacology', 'U937 Cells']",2005/09/06 09:00,2005/11/16 09:00,['2005/09/06 09:00'],"['2005/09/06 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/11/16 09:00 [medline]', '2005/09/06 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 2005 Sep 1;65(17):7856-65. doi: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-05-1056.,,"['0 (LCOR protein, human)', '0 (RARA protein, human)', '0 (Receptors, Retinoic Acid)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (Retinoic Acid Receptor alpha)', '0 (Thiophenes)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)']",,"['65/17/7856 [pii]', '10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-05-1056 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To identify more potent chemical differentiation inducers, a screening assay was developed utilizing an ATRA-insensitive NB4 cell line (NB4-c) in which differentiation could be measured after 48 hours when primed with ATRA followed by other potential inducers. Over 300 cytostatic agents selected from the National Cancer Institute library were screened using this established method. Three compounds, NSC656243, NSC625748, and NSC144168, were identified to amplify ATRA-induced differentiation with acceptable cytotoxicity in NB4-c cells. In the absence of ATRA, these compounds also induced HL-60 and murine erythroleukemia cells to undergo partial differentiation. NSC656243, a benzodithiophene compound, was selected for further studies to examine the underlying mechanism of action. The differentiation effect of NSC656243 was associated with enhanced ATRA-mediated up-regulation of cell cycle regulatory proteins p21waf1 and p27kip1, retinoblastoma dephosphorylation, expression of RIG-E and RIG-G, and myelomonocytic differentiation-specific down-regulation of the myeloperoxidase (MPO) gene. Moreover, at 2- to 3-fold higher concentrations than those used to synergize with ATRA, NSC656243 induced apoptosis in NB4-c cells by reactive oxygen species-mediated pathways. The dual effects of benzodithiophenes (i.e., differentiation and apoptosis induction) support further development of these compounds as therapeutic agents for leukemia.","['Jing, Yongkui', 'Hellinger, Nella', 'Xia, Lijuan', 'Monks, Anne', 'Sausville, Edward A', 'Zelent, Arthur', 'Waxman, Samuel']","['Jing Y', 'Hellinger N', 'Xia L', 'Monks A', 'Sausville EA', 'Zelent A', 'Waxman S']","['Division of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Medicine, Mount Sinai School of Medicine, New York, New York 10029-6547, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,IM,"['Animals', 'Antioxidants/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Cell Differentiation/*drug effects', 'Cyclin D1/biosynthesis/metabolism', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/drug therapy/pathology', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/drug therapy/pathology', 'Mice', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Thiophenes/*pharmacology', 'Tretinoin/pharmacology']",2005/09/06 09:00,2005/11/16 09:00,['2005/09/06 09:00'],"['2005/09/06 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/11/16 09:00 [medline]', '2005/09/06 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 2005 Sep 1;65(17):7847-55. doi: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-05-1053.,,"['0 (Antioxidants)', '0 (Thiophenes)', '136601-57-5 (Cyclin D1)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)']",,"['65/17/7847 [pii]', '10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-05-1053 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This chromosomal translocation is associated with de novo and therapy-related acute myeloid leukemia and with the blast crisis of chronic myelogenous leukemia. AME is obtained by in-frame fusion of the AML1 and MDS1/EVI1 (ME) genes. The mechanisms by which AME induces a neoplastic transformation in bone marrow cells are unknown. AME interacts with the corepressors CtBP and HDAC1, and it was shown that AME is a repressor in contrast to the parent transcription factors AML1 and ME, which are transcription activators. Studies with murine bone marrow progenitors indicated that the introduction of a point mutation that destroys the CtBP-binding consensus impairs but does not abolish the disruption of cell differentiation and replication associated with AME expression, suggesting that additional events are required. Several chimeric proteins, such as AML1/ETO, BCR/ABL, and PML/RARa, are characterized by the presence of a self-interaction domain critical for transformation. We report that AME is also able to oligomerize and displays a complex pattern of self-interaction that involves at least three oligomerization regions, one of which is the distal zinc finger domain. Although the deletion of this short domain does not preclude the self-interaction of AME, it significantly reduces the differentiation defects caused in vitro by AME in primary murine bone marrow progenitors. The addition of a point mutation that inhibits CtBP binding completely abrogates the effects of AME on differentiation, suggesting that AME induces hematopoietic differentiation defects through at least two separate but cooperating pathways.","['Senyuk, Vitalyi', 'Li, Donglan', 'Zakharov, Alexander', 'Mikhail, Fady M', 'Nucifora, Giuseppina']","['Senyuk V', 'Li D', 'Zakharov A', 'Mikhail FM', 'Nucifora G']","['Department of Pathology and The Cancer Center, University of Illinois at Chicago, Chicago, Illinois 60607, USA. vsenyuk@uic.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,IM,"['Alcohol Oxidoreductases', 'Animals', 'Bone Marrow Cells/cytology/metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation/physiology', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/metabolism', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/metabolism', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*cytology/metabolism/physiology', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'NIH 3T3 Cells', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/genetics/*metabolism', 'Phosphoproteins/metabolism', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Repressor Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Transfection', 'Up-Regulation', 'Zinc Fingers/genetics/*physiology']",2005/09/06 09:00,2005/11/16 09:00,['2005/09/06 09:00'],"['2005/09/06 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/11/16 09:00 [medline]', '2005/09/06 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 2005 Sep 1;65(17):7603-11. doi: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-05-0412.,"['CA67189/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA96448/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL72691/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']","['0 (AML1-MDS1-EVI1 fusion protein, human)', '0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Phosphoproteins)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', 'EC 1.1.- (Alcohol Oxidoreductases)', 'EC 1.1.1.- (C-terminal binding protein)']",,"['65/17/7603 [pii]', '10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-05-0412 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Acquired additions of chromosome 21 are a common finding in leukemias, suggesting a contributory role to leukemogenesis. About 10% of patients with a germ line trisomy 21 (Down syndrome) are born with transient megakaryoblastic leukemia. We and others have shown acquired mutations in the X chromosome gene GATA1 in all these cases. The gene or genes on chromosome 21 whose overexpression promote the megakaryoblastic phenotype are presently unknown. We propose that ERG, an Ets transcription factor situated on chromosome 21, is one such candidate. We show that ERG is expressed in hematopoietic stem cells, megakaryoblastic cell lines, and in primary leukemic cells from Down syndrome patients. ERG expression is induced upon megakaryocytic differentiation of the erythroleukemia cell lines K562 and UT-7, and forced expression of ERG in K562 cells induces erythroid to megakaryoblastic phenotypic switch. We also show that ERG activates the gpIb megakaryocytic promoter and binds the gpIIb promoter in vivo. Furthermore, both ERG and ETS2 bind in vivo the hematopoietic enhancer of SCL/TAL1, a key regulator of hematopoietic stem cell and megakaryocytic development. We propose that trisomy 21 facilitates the occurrence of megakaryoblastic leukemias through a shift toward the megakaryoblastic lineage caused by the excess expression of ERG, and possibly by other chromosome 21 genes, such as RUNX1 and ETS2, in hematopoietic progenitor cells, coupled with a differentiation arrest caused by the acquisition of mutations in GATA1.","['Rainis, Liat', 'Toki, Tsutomu', 'Pimanda, John E', 'Rosenthal, Ester', 'Machol, Keren', 'Strehl, Sabine', 'Gottgens, Berthold', 'Ito, Etsuro', 'Izraeli, Shai']","['Rainis L', 'Toki T', 'Pimanda JE', 'Rosenthal E', 'Machol K', 'Strehl S', 'Gottgens B', 'Ito E', 'Izraeli S']","[""Department of Pediatric Hematology-Oncology, Safra Children's Hospital and Hematology Institute, Sheba Cancer Research Center, Sheba Medical Center, Tel-Hashomer, Israel.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors', 'Cell Lineage', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 21/genetics', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/biosynthesis/*genetics/metabolism', 'Erythroid-Specific DNA-Binding Factors', 'GATA1 Transcription Factor', 'HeLa Cells', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/metabolism', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/genetics/pathology', 'Leukemia, Megakaryoblastic, Acute/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Oncogene Proteins/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Proto-Oncogene Mas', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/metabolism', 'T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1', 'Trans-Activators/biosynthesis/*genetics/metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/metabolism', 'Transcriptional Regulator ERG']",2005/09/06 09:00,2005/11/16 09:00,['2005/09/06 09:00'],"['2005/09/06 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/11/16 09:00 [medline]', '2005/09/06 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 2005 Sep 1;65(17):7596-602. doi: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-05-0147.,,"['0 (Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (ERG protein, human)', '0 (Erythroid-Specific DNA-Binding Factors)', '0 (GATA1 Transcription Factor)', '0 (GATA1 protein, human)', '0 (MAS1 protein, human)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Mas)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Transcriptional Regulator ERG)', '135471-20-4 (TAL1 protein, human)']",,"['65/17/7596 [pii]', '10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-05-0147 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, it was shown that imatinib can affect the function of normal, nonmalignant cells, resulting in myelosuppression in treated patients. Recently, it has been demonstrated that imatinib might affect mobilization, proliferation, and differentiation of hematopoietic progenitor cells while leaving hematopoietic stem cells unaffected. Furthermore, in several in vitro studies and animal models, it was demonstrated that imatinib can affect the function and differentiation of antigen-presenting cells and inhibit the effector functions of T lymphocytes. Moreover, the induction of specific cytotoxic T cells seems to be impaired in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) patients treated with imatinib compared with patients receiving interferon-alpha. This is of importance because some of the therapeutic effects in the treatment of patients with CML are mediated by the induction of leukemia-specific T-cell responses.

We found that HTLV-2 Tax2 protein stimulated reporter gene expression regulated by the interleukin (IL)-2 promoter through the nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) in a human T-cell line (Jurkat). However, the activity of HTLV-1 Tax1 was minimal in this system. T-cell lines immortalized by HTLV-2 but not HTLV-1 constitutively exhibited activated NFAT in the nucleus and constitutively expressed IL-2 mRNA. Cyclosporine A, an inhibitor of NFAT activation, abrogated the induction of IL-2 mRNA in HTLV-2-immortalized T-cell lines and concomitantly inhibited cell growth. This growth inhibition was rescued by the addition of IL-2 to the culture. Furthermore, anti-IL-2 receptor antibodies significantly reduced the proliferation of HTLV-2-infected T-cell lines but not that of HTLV-1-infected cells.

This mechanism would be especially important in vivo, where this autocrine mechanism establishes a nonleukemogenic life-long HTLV-2 infection.

Although experimentally validated models have been presented to address the mechanism by which oncogene capture occurs, very little is known about the events that influence emerging viruses following the recombination event that incorporates the cellular sequences. One feature that may play a role is the genetic makeup of the host in which the virus arises; a number of host genes, including oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes, have been shown to affect the pathogenesis of many murine leukemia viruses. To examine how a host gene might affect an emerging v-onc gene-containing retrovirus, we studied the weakly oncogenic Ab-MLV-P90A strain, a mutant that generates highly oncogenic variants in vivo, and compared the viral populations in normal mice and mice lacking the p53 tumor suppressor gene. While variants arose in both p53+/+ and p53-/- tumors, the samples from the wild-type animals contained a more diverse virus population. Differences in virus population diversity were not observed when wild-type and null animals were infected with a highly oncogenic wild-type strain of Ab-MLV. These results indicate that p53, and presumably other host genes, affects the selective forces that operate on virus populations in vivo and likely influences the evolution of oncogenic retroviruses such as Ab-MLV.","['Marchlik, Erica', 'Kalman, Richard', 'Rosenberg, Naomi']","['Marchlik E', 'Kalman R', 'Rosenberg N']","['Immunology Graduate Program, Sackler School of Graduate Biomedical Sciences, Tufts University School of Medicine, Boston, Massachusetts 02111, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,IM,"['Abelson murine leukemia virus/*genetics/isolation & purification/*pathogenicity', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'DNA, Viral/genetics', 'Female', '*Genes, p53', 'Genetic Variation', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*genetics/*virology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Mutation', 'Retroviridae Infections/*genetics/*virology', 'Tumor Virus Infections/*genetics/*virology', 'Virulence/genetics', 'Virus Integration/genetics']",2005/09/06 09:00,2005/10/06 09:00,['2005/09/06 09:00'],"['2005/09/06 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/10/06 09:00 [medline]', '2005/09/06 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Virol. 2005 Sep;79(18):11618-26. doi: 10.1128/JVI.79.18.11618-11626.2005.,"['R01 CA024220/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 24220/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['0 (DNA, Viral)']",,"['79/18/11618 [pii]', '10.1128/JVI.79.18.11618-11626.2005 [doi]']",,,,,PMC1212633,,,,,,,,,,,

Amphibian skin provides a rich source of broad-spectrum antimicrobial peptides including some that have antiviral activity. We tested 14 peptides derived from diverse amphibian species for the capacity to inhibit HIV infection. Three peptides (caerin 1.1, caerin 1.9, and maculatin 1.1) completely inhibited HIV infection of T cells within minutes of exposure to virus at concentrations that were not toxic to target cells. These peptides also suppressed infection by murine leukemia virus but not by reovirus, a structurally unrelated nonenveloped virus. Preincubation with peptides prevented viral fusion to target cells and disrupted the HIV envelope. Remarkably, these amphibian peptides also were highly effective in inhibiting the transfer of HIV by dendritic cells (DCs) to T cells, even when DCs were transiently exposed to peptides 8 h after virus capture. These data suggest that amphibian-derived peptides can access DC-sequestered HIV and destroy the virus before it can be transferred to T cells.

We reviewed available scientific literature to determine whether this was scientifically supported. We identified more than 50 chemicals causing cancer after perinatal exposure. Human data are extremely limited, with radiation exposures showing increased early susceptibility at some tumor sites. Twenty-seven rodent studies for 18 chemicals had sufficient data after postnatal and adult exposures to quantitatively estimate potential increased susceptibility from early-life exposure, calculated as the ratio of juvenile to adult cancer potencies for three study types: acute dosing, repeated dosing, and lifetime dosing. Twelve of the chemicals act through a mutagenic mode of action. For these, the geometric mean ratio was 11 for lifetime exposures and 8.7 for repeat exposures, with a ratio of 10 for these studies combined. The geometric mean ratio for acute studies is 1.5, which was influenced by tissue-specific results [geometric mean ratios for kidney, leukemia, liver, lymph, mammary, nerve, reticular tissue, thymic lymphoma, and uterus/vagina > 1 (range, 1.6-8.1); forestomach, harderian gland, ovaries, and thyroid < 1 (range, 0.033-0.45)]. Chemicals causing cancer through other modes of action indicate some increased susceptibility from postnatal exposure (geometric mean ratio is 3.4 for lifetime exposure, 2.2 for repeat exposure). Early exposures to compounds with endocrine activity sometimes produce different tumors after exposures at different ages.

We present here the dynamic gene network of the host immune response during human herpesvirus type 6 (HHV-6) infection in an adult T-cell leukemia cell line.

Gene network analysis using an integrated comprehensive workbench, VoyaGene, revealed that a gene encoding a TEC-family kinase, ITK, might be a putative modulator in the host immune response against HHV-6B infection. We conclude that Th2-dominated inflammatory reaction in host cells may play an important role in HHV-6B-infected T cells, thereby suggesting the possibility that ITK might be a therapeutic target in diseases related to dysregulation of Th1/Th2 balance. This study describes a novel approach to find genes related with the complex host-virus interaction using microarray data employing the Bayesian statistical framework.","['Takaku, Tomoiku', 'Ohyashiki, Junko H', 'Zhang, Yu', 'Ohyashiki, Kazuma']","['Takaku T', 'Ohyashiki JH', 'Zhang Y', 'Ohyashiki K']","['First Department of Internal Medicine, Tokyo Medical University, Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Biochem Biophys Res Commun,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,0372516,IM,"['Adult', 'Cell Line', 'Chemokines/*immunology', 'Computer Simulation', 'Gene Expression Regulation/immunology', 'Herpesvirus 6, Human/*immunology', 'Humans', '*Models, Immunological', 'Roseolovirus Infections/*immunology/*virology', 'Signal Transduction/immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology/*virology']",2005/09/06 09:00,2005/11/16 09:00,['2005/09/06 09:00'],"['2005/08/08 00:00 [received]', '2005/08/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2005/09/06 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/11/16 09:00 [medline]', '2005/09/06 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Biochem Biophys Res Commun. 2005 Oct 21;336(2):469-77. doi: 10.1016/j.bbrc.2005.08.104.,,['0 (Chemokines)'],,"['S0006-291X(05)01820-6 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bbrc.2005.08.104 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This effect has been shown to be elicited by interaction with the plasma membrane microdomain lipid rafts. Recently, we have identified the 67 kDa laminin receptor (67LR) as a cell surface EGCG receptor that mediates an anti-cancer action. Here we show that the 67LR is highly associated with lipid rafts on human basophilic KU812 cells. Experiments using 67LR-enhanced and -reduced cells revealed that the EGCG's ability to downregulate FcepsilonRI expression correlated with the amount of 67LR. Thus, these results suggest that the lipid raft-associated 67LR plays an important role in mediating the FcepsilonRI-suppressive action of EGCG.","['Fujimura, Yoshinori', 'Yamada, Koji', 'Tachibana, Hirofumi']","['Fujimura Y', 'Yamada K', 'Tachibana H']","['Department of Bioscience and Biotechnology, Faculty of Agriculture, Kyushu University, 6-10-1 Hakozaki, Higashi-ku, Fukuoka 812-8581, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Biochem Biophys Res Commun,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,0372516,IM,"['Catechin/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Down-Regulation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Basophilic, Acute/*metabolism', 'Membrane Microdomains/*metabolism', 'Molecular Weight', 'Receptors, IgG/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Laminin/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2005/09/06 09:00,2005/11/16 09:00,['2005/09/06 09:00'],"['2005/08/12 00:00 [received]', '2005/08/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2005/09/06 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/11/16 09:00 [medline]', '2005/09/06 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Biochem Biophys Res Commun. 2005 Oct 21;336(2):674-81. doi: 10.1016/j.bbrc.2005.08.146.,,"['0 (FCGR1A protein, human)', '0 (Receptors, IgG)', '0 (Receptors, Laminin)', '8R1V1STN48 (Catechin)', 'BQM438CTEL (epigallocatechin gallate)']",,"['S0006-291X(05)01829-2 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bbrc.2005.08.146 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Adhesion to neighboring somatic cells is also believed to be crucial for preventing PGC apoptosis occurring when they lose appropriate cell to cell contacts. This explains the current impossibility to maintain isolated mouse PGCs in culture for periods longer than a few hours in the absence of suitable cell feeder layers producing soluble factors and expressing surface molecules necessary for preventing PGTC apoptosis and stimulating their proliferation. In the present paper, we identified a cocktail of soluble growth factors, namely KL, LIF, BMP-4, SDF-1, bFGF and compounds (N-acetyl-L-cysteine, forskolin, retinoic acid) able to sustain the survival and self-renewal of mouse PGCs in the absence of somatic cell support. We show that under culture conditions allowing PGC adhesion to an acellular substrate, such growth factors and compounds were able to prevent the occurrence of significant levels of apoptosis in PGCs for two days, stimulate their proliferation and, when LIF was omitted from the cocktail, allow most of them to enter into and progress through meiotic prophase I. These results consent for the first time to establish culture conditions for purified mammalian PGCs in the absence of somatic cell support and should make easier the molecular dissection of the processes governing the development of such cells crucial for early gametogenesis.","['Farini, Donatella', 'Scaldaferri, Maria Lucia', 'Iona, Saveria', 'La Sala, Gina', 'De Felici, Massimo']","['Farini D', 'Scaldaferri ML', 'Iona S', 'La Sala G', 'De Felici M']","['Department of Public Health and Cell Biology, Section of Histology and Embryology, University of Rome Tor Vergata, Via Montpellier 1, Rome 00173, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Dev Biol,Developmental biology,0372762,IM,"['Acetylcysteine/pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Colforsin/pharmacology', 'Female', 'Germ Cells/*cytology/*drug effects', 'Growth Substances/*pharmacology', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Interleukin-6/pharmacology', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Male', 'Meiosis/drug effects', 'Mice', 'Oocytes/cytology/drug effects', 'Oogenesis/drug effects', 'Spermatogenesis/drug effects', 'Spermatogonia/cytology/drug effects', 'Stem Cells/*cytology/*drug effects', 'Tretinoin/pharmacology']",2005/09/06 09:00,2005/12/13 09:00,['2005/09/06 09:00'],"['2004/12/10 00:00 [received]', '2005/06/08 00:00 [revised]', '2005/06/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2005/09/06 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/12/13 09:00 [medline]', '2005/09/06 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Dev Biol. 2005 Sep 1;285(1):49-56. doi: 10.1016/j.ydbio.2005.06.036.,,"['0 (Growth Substances)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', '1F7A44V6OU (Colforsin)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'WYQ7N0BPYC (Acetylcysteine)']",,"['S0012-1606(05)00393-3 [pii]', '10.1016/j.ydbio.2005.06.036 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This finding suggests that the mechanism of action of PADMA 28 may be via interference with Bcl-2 triggered survival pathways.","['Jenny, Marcel', 'Schwaiger, Wolfgang', 'Bernhard, David', 'Wrulich, Oliver A', 'Cosaceanu, Daria', 'Fuchs, Dietmar', 'Ueberall, Florian']","['Jenny M', 'Schwaiger W', 'Bernhard D', 'Wrulich OA', 'Cosaceanu D', 'Fuchs D', 'Ueberall F']","['Division of Medical Biochemistry, Biocenter, Innsbruck Medical School, Fritz Pregl-str. 3, 6020, Innsbruck, Austria. marcel.jenny@uibk.ac.at']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],India,J Carcinog,Journal of carcinogenesis,101153623,,,2005/09/06 09:00,2005/09/06 09:01,['2005/09/06 09:00'],"['2004/08/12 00:00 [received]', '2005/09/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2005/09/06 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/09/06 09:01 [medline]', '2005/09/06 09:00 [entrez]']",epublish,J Carcinog. 2005 Sep 2;4:15. doi: 10.1186/1477-3163-4-15.,,,,"['1477-3163-4-15 [pii]', '10.1186/1477-3163-4-15 [doi]']",,,,20050902,PMC1232859,,,,,,,,,,,

Most of these studies focus on the manipulation of undifferentiated stem cells. However, tissue repair and regeneration can also be achieved by differentiated cells, which, in certain conditions, can even transdifferentiate to other cell types. Such transdifferentiations can lead to tissue metaplasia. The pancreas is an organ wherein metaplasia has been well investigated and for which experimental models have been recently developed allowing to unravel the molecular basis of transdifferentiation. Pancreatic metaplasias studied so far include the conversion of exocrine acinar cells to duct cells, exocrine cells to endocrine islet cells, endocrine cells to duct cells, and acinar cells to hepatocytes. Epitheliomesenchymal transitions have also been described. The available evidence indicates that mature cells can be reprogrammed by specific environmental cues inducing the expression of cell type-specific transcription factors. For example, the glucocorticoid hormone dexamethasone induces pancreatic transdifferentiation to hepatocytes, whereas the combination of epidermal growth factor and leukemia-inhibitory factor induces exocrine-endocrine transdifferentiation in vitro. Further unravelling of the involved signal transduction pathways, transcription factor networks, and chromatin modifications is required to manipulate metaplasia at will and to apply it in tissue repair or regeneration.","['Lardon, Jessy', 'Bouwens, Luc']","['Lardon J', 'Bouwens L']","['Cell Differentiation Unit, Diabetes Research Center, Free University of Brussels, Vrije Universiteit Brussel, Laarbeeklaan 103, B-1090 Brussels, Belgium.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Differentiation,Differentiation; research in biological diversity,0401650,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Humans', 'Metaplasia/embryology/etiology', 'Pancreas/*embryology/*pathology', 'Pancreatic Diseases/*etiology/pathology']",2005/09/06 09:00,2005/11/15 09:00,['2005/09/06 09:00'],"['2005/09/06 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/11/15 09:00 [medline]', '2005/09/06 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Differentiation. 2005 Jul;73(6):278-86. doi: 10.1111/j.1432-0436.2005.00030.x.,,,111,"['S0301-4681(09)60338-8 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1432-0436.2005.00030.x [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

One of the most important proteins, the over-expression of which is responsible for the multidrug-resistance phenotype in many cancer types, is P-glycoprotein. This protein is the product of the MDR1 gene. In previous studies, single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) C3435T, G2677T, and T-129C in the MDR1 gene were shown to be correlated with lower P-glycoprotein expression in normal tissues. It was suggested that this might have an advantage in cancer chemotherapy by resulting in a low drug-resistance phenotype. The frequencies of these SNPs were studied in 45 acute leukemia patients (25 of which were primary refractory and 20 of which were drug-sensitive) and 17 healthy individuals, forming a Turkish population of 62 individuals. In the first part of the study, these polymorphisms were compared with other populations. Marked differences were apparent between African and Turkish populations for the C3435T polymorphism. On the other hand, similarities were found between other Caucasian/Asian and Turkish populations (P < 0.001). However, for the G2677T polymorphism, the Turkish population is different than Japanese and German populations (P < 0.001). For the T-129C polymorphism, all individuals in the studied population were homozygous for the T/T genotype. In the second part of this study, drug-resistant and drug-sensitive acute leukemia patients were compared for these SNPs. These polymorphisms did not seem to have a significant effect on P-glycoprotein-mediated drug resistance in the patients studied.","['Kaya, Pelin', 'Gunduz, Ufuk', 'Arpaci, Fikret', 'Ural, Ali Ugur', 'Guran, Sefik']","['Kaya P', 'Gunduz U', 'Arpaci F', 'Ural AU', 'Guran S']","['Department of Biology, Middle East Technical University, Ankara, Turkey.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Am J Hematol,American journal of hematology,7610369,IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/*genetics', 'Acute Disease', 'Antigens, CD/immunology', 'DNA, Neoplasm/blood/genetics/isolation & purification', 'Drug Resistance, Multiple/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia/drug therapy/*genetics', '*Polymorphism, Genetic', '*Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide', 'Reference Values', 'Turkey']",2005/09/03 09:00,2005/11/16 09:00,['2005/09/03 09:00'],"['2005/09/03 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/11/16 09:00 [medline]', '2005/09/03 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Am J Hematol. 2005 Sep;80(1):26-34. doi: 10.1002/ajh.20427.,,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)']",,['10.1002/ajh.20427 [doi]'],,"['Copyright 2005 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, we investigate the role of short-course HDMP on induction of a myeloprotective effect when administered before consolidation therapy consisting of high-dose cytosine arabinoside and daunorubicin. Thirty-four consecutive newly diagnosed children with acute myeloblastic leukemia (AML) who received 64 courses of consolidation regimen were entered into the study. The patients received HDMP (group A) at a daily dose of 30 mg/kg methylprednisolone starting 4 days before the initiation of consolidation therapy. The control group did not receive HDMP (group B). There were no differences in the white blood cell (WBC) and absolute neutrophil counts (ANC) between group A (at day -4) and group B (at day 0) at the beginning of the study (medians: 3 x 10(9)/L vs. 3.2 x 10(9)/L and 1.5 x 10(9)/L vs. 1.7 x 10(9)/L, respectively). The WBC count increased significantly from 3 x 10(9)/L to 6.4 x 10(9)/L, and ANC increased from 1.5 x 10(9)/L to 3.9 x 10(9)/L after 4 days of HDMP treatment in group A (P < 0.01). Following high-dose chemotherapy, the median values of WBC and ANC also remained higher than the control values during the 16 days of the follow-up period. The neutropenic period was significantly shorter in the HDMP group than in the control group (9 +/- 5.2 days vs. 22 +/- 4.7 days) (P < 0.05). The duration of hospitalization and the interval between two chemotherapy cycles were significantly decreased in group A when compared group B (9 +/- 2.7 vs. 14 +/- 2.7 days; 22 +/- 4.7 vs. 26 +/- 4.2 days, respectively) (P < 0.05). Moreover, following consolidation therapy, the number of patients with ANC values below 0.5 x 10(9)/L was lower in group A when compared the group B. In conclusion, the administration of short-course (4 days) HDMP before high-dose chemotherapy has been found to be beneficial for reducing the duration and severity of neutropenia. Further studies with short-course HDMP are required to evaluate its myeloprotective effects in patients with other malignancies.","['Elmas, Selin Aytac', 'Cetin, Mualla', 'Tuncer, Murat', 'Hicsonmez, Gonul']","['Elmas SA', 'Cetin M', 'Tuncer M', 'Hicsonmez G']","['Hacettepe University, Faculty of Medicine, Department of Pediatrics, Hematology Unit, Ankara, Turkey.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial']",United States,Am J Hematol,American journal of hematology,7610369,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Glucocorticoids/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Methylprednisolone/*therapeutic use']",2005/09/03 09:00,2005/11/16 09:00,['2005/09/03 09:00'],"['2005/09/03 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/11/16 09:00 [medline]', '2005/09/03 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Am J Hematol. 2005 Sep;80(1):1-5. doi: 10.1002/ajh.20277.,,"['0 (Glucocorticoids)', 'X4W7ZR7023 (Methylprednisolone)']",,['10.1002/ajh.20277 [doi]'],,"['Copyright 2005 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The objective of this study was to evaluate the frequency and prognostic significance of myeloid antigen expression in adults with high risk ALL. PATIENTS AND METHOD: Between June 1993 and July 2002, 222 adults patients with high-risk ALL were treated according to the PETHEMA LAL 93 protocol. The frequency of myeloid antigen expression, its association with other clinical and biologic variables and the prognostic significance in terms of complete remission (CR) rate, event free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS) were analyzed. RESULTS: Myeloid antigen expression was present in 96 out of 222 patients (43%). No association was observed between myeloid antigen expression and the main clinical and biologic characteristics of ALL. Response to treatment was slower in patients expressing myeloid antigens, but no differences were found in CR achievement, EFS or OS. The probability of EFS at 10 years for ALL patients without and with myeloid antigen expression was 35% and 34%, respectively, while the probability of OS at 10 years was 30% and 33%, respectively. This absence of differences in EFS and OS probabilities was also observed when only slow responding patients were analyzed. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, myeloid antigen expression did not have prognostic influence in adult patients with high risk ALL.","['Plensa, Esther', 'Ribera, Josep Maria', 'Oriol, Albert', 'Bethencourt, Concepcion', 'Parody, Ricardo', 'Hernandez Ribas, Jesus Maria', 'Moreno, Maria Jose', 'del Potro, Eloy', 'Tormo, Mar', 'Rivas, Concepcion', 'Besalduch, Joan', 'Sanz, Miguel Angel', 'Arias, Jesus', 'Fernandez Calvo, Javier', 'Moraleda, Jose Maria', 'Bueno, Javier', 'Feliu, Evarist', 'Ortega, Juan Jose']","['Plensa E', 'Ribera JM', 'Oriol A', 'Bethencourt C', 'Parody R', 'Hernandez Ribas JM', 'Moreno MJ', 'del Potro E', 'Tormo M', 'Rivas C', 'Besalduch J', 'Sanz MA', 'Arias J', 'Fernandez Calvo J', 'Moraleda JM', 'Bueno J', 'Feliu E', 'Ortega JJ']","['Hospital Universitari Germans Trias i Pujol, Badalona, Barcelona, Spain.']",['spa'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Spain,Med Clin (Barc),Medicina clinica,0376377,IM,"['Adult', 'Antigens, CD/*blood', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/*immunology/*mortality', 'Prevalence', 'Prognosis', 'Survival Analysis']",2005/09/03 09:00,2005/10/26 09:00,['2005/09/03 09:00'],"['2005/09/03 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/10/26 09:00 [medline]', '2005/09/03 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Med Clin (Barc). 2005 Sep 3;125(7):241-6. doi: 10.1157/13078098.,,"['0 (Antigens, CD)']",,"['S0025-7753(05)72008-X [pii]', '10.1157/13078098 [doi]']",Prevalencia y significado pronostico de los marcadores mieloides en adultos con leucemia aguda linfoblastica de alto riesgo.,,['Grupo PETHEMA'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

These unique cells may provide effective therapeutic approaches to tissue damage resulting from hypoxemia or chronic ischemia. Here, we study the fate of adult scl (+/+) during development and their ability to reverse genetic defects in scl expression. scl (+/+) adult stem cells (clone RM26) did not persist during embryonic development after injection into blastocysts of allogeneic wild-type mice on day E 3.5. However, GFP(+)-marked scl (+/+) cells were detected in all possible genotypes from allogeneic scl (+/+) intercrosses (scl (+/+), scl (+/-), scl (-/-) on day E 9.5 after the cloned cells were injected into scl-mutant blastocysts on day E 3.5. Nevertheless, there was no indication of phenotypic rescue of the mutant blastocysts despite the continued presence of scl (+/+) RM26 cells in the allogeneic embryonic environment. The results show that differentiated stem cells providing a defective gene may exert effects during development when there is a reparative demand, but they are not capable of reversing the effects of a mutant phenotype during embryonic development. These effects should be considered when evaluating the efficacy of stem cells for therapeutic reversal of inborn errors of development.","['Huss, Ralf', 'Renner-Muller, Ingrid', 'Buchstaller, Andrea']","['Huss R', 'Renner-Muller I', 'Buchstaller A']","['Institute of Pathology, Ludwig-Maximilians University of Munich, Munich, Germany. ralf.huss@roche.com']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Stem Cells Dev,Stem cells and development,101197107,IM,"['Animals', 'Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors', 'Blastocyst/*metabolism', 'Blood Cells/cytology', 'Cell Differentiation', 'DNA/metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics/*physiology', 'Embryo, Mammalian/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental', 'Green Fluorescent Proteins/metabolism', 'Hypoxia', 'Ischemia', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Inbred C3H', '*Mutation', '*Neovascularization, Physiologic', 'Phenotype', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*genetics/*physiology', 'Stem Cells/cytology', 'T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1', 'Time Factors', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics/*physiology', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",2005/09/03 09:00,2005/11/04 09:00,['2005/09/03 09:00'],"['2005/09/03 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/11/04 09:00 [medline]', '2005/09/03 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Stem Cells Dev. 2005 Aug;14(4):402-7. doi: 10.1089/scd.2005.14.402.,,"['0 (Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1)', '0 (Tal1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '147336-22-9 (Green Fluorescent Proteins)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",,['10.1089/scd.2005.14.402 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To examine the impact of activated neutrophils, we compared two groups of children including 18 with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and 7 with acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) by an ultrastructural leukocyte count method. Many cases (50%) showed more than 30% activated neutrophils per total neutrophil count in PB. Activated neutrophils were elongated or amoeboid-shaped cells ranging from 13-18 microns in greater diameter with a decreased number of granules in the cytoplasm. A significantly higher rate of activated neutrophils was observed in ALL as compared with AML (median: 42.97% vs. 10.64%). Non-leukemic hospitalized (n =3) and healthy (n = 3) control cases showed a median rate of 3.32% activated neutrophils in PB. These findings reveal that a significantly high rate of activated neutrophils occurs in PB of children with ALL which may be exploited in the diagnostic assessment of children with acute leukemias.","['Adachi, A', 'Sato, S', 'Sasaki, Y', 'Ghazizadeh, M', 'Maeda, M', 'Kaizu, K', 'Liu, X L', 'Fukunaga, Y']","['Adachi A', 'Sato S', 'Sasaki Y', 'Ghazizadeh M', 'Maeda M', 'Kaizu K', 'Liu XL', 'Fukunaga Y']","['Central Institute for Electron Microscopic Research, Tokyo, Japan. a-adachi@nms.ac.jp']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",Italy,J Submicrosc Cytol Pathol,Journal of submicroscopic cytology and pathology,8804312,IM,"['Child', 'Cytoplasmic Granules/ultrastructure', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*blood/pathology', 'Leukocyte Count', '*Neutrophil Activation', 'Neutrophils/*immunology/*ultrastructure', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*blood/pathology']",2005/09/03 09:00,2005/10/07 09:00,['2005/09/03 09:00'],"['2005/09/03 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/10/07 09:00 [medline]', '2005/09/03 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Submicrosc Cytol Pathol. 2005 Apr;37(1):13-8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In numerous clinical trials thalidomide is used as an adjunct to standard therapy. Therefore, clinicians should be aware of all possible drug-drug interactions that might occur with this drug. P-glycoprotein (P-gp), a drug efflux transporter that is expressed in many tissues, is the cause of several drug-drug interactions. P-gp induction or inhibition can lead to ineffective therapy or side-effects. In this study, we investigated thalidomide's potential to cause drug-drug interactions on the level of P-gp. METHODS: LS180 cells were incubated with thalidomide for 72 h in order to determine P-gp induction using real-time RT-PCR. A human leukaemia cell line over-expressing MDR1 (CCRF-CEM/MDR1) was used to measure uptake of rhodamine 123, a P-gp substrate, in the presence of thalidomide. Dose-dependent and bi-directional transport of thalidomide through Caco-2 cell monolayers was performed to assess site-directed permeability. Transport rates were determined using HPLC including chiral separation of the thalidomide enantiomers. RESULTS: Thalidomide did not induce P-gp expression in LS180 cells. The uptake of rhodamine 123 in CCRF cells over-expressing MDR1 was not influenced by co-incubation with thalidomide. The transport through Caco-2 monolayers was linear and the permeability was similar for both directions. No differences between the thalidomide enantiomers were observed. CONCLUSIONS: Our study indicates that thalidomide is neither a substrate, nor an inhibitor or an inducer of P-gp. Therefore, P-gp-related drug-drug interactions with thalidomide are not likely.","['Zimmermann, Christian', 'Gutmann, Heike', 'Drewe, Juergen']","['Zimmermann C', 'Gutmann H', 'Drewe J']","['Department of Clinical Pharmacology and Toxicology Petersgraben, University Hospital Basel and Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Petersgraben 4, CH-4031, Basel, Switzerland.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Germany,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol,Cancer chemotherapy and pharmacology,7806519,IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/genetics/*metabolism', 'Biological Transport', 'Caco-2 Cells', 'Drug Interactions', 'Drug Resistance, Multiple', 'Humans', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/*metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Rhodamine 123/metabolism', 'Thalidomide/*metabolism']",2005/09/02 09:00,2006/04/12 09:00,['2005/09/02 09:00'],"['2005/05/24 00:00 [received]', '2005/07/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2005/09/02 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/04/12 09:00 [medline]', '2005/09/02 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol. 2006 May;57(5):599-606. doi: 10.1007/s00280-005-0087-3.

Evidence in vivo in mice.,309-14,"Echinacea has been viewed as an immunoenhancing herb since it became commercially available several years ago. Indeed, its medicinal significance is responsible for billions of dollars in worldwide sales annually. Unfortunately, most of the 'evidence' for the purported medicinal efficacy of Echinacea has been anecdotal and, moreover, to this day, there is no formal proof on how to achieve the best results-whether it should be consumed daily throughout life as a prophylactic; consumed by either young or old; or consumed after diseases, such as cancer, have taken hold. Our work over the past 5 years has led to conclusive answers to some of these questions, at least in mice. Our results have shown that daily consumption of Echinacea is indeed prophylactic, extends the life span of aging mice, significantly abates leukemia and extends the life span of leukemic mice. Given that humans are 97% genetically common with mice and that virtually all our basic physiology is identical, it is neither unjustified to extrapolate these observations to humans nor would it be an arduous task to perform many of these studies in humans, thus establishing viable scientific evidence replacing the anecdotal.","['Miller, Sandra C']",['Miller SC'],"['Department of Anatomy and Cell Biology, McGill University Montreal, Quebec, Canada.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Evid Based Complement Alternat Med,Evidence-based complementary and alternative medicine : eCAM,101215021,,,2005/09/02 09:00,2005/09/02 09:01,['2005/09/02 09:00'],"['2004/10/12 00:00 [received]', '2005/07/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2005/09/02 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/09/02 09:01 [medline]', '2005/09/02 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Evid Based Complement Alternat Med. 2005 Sep;2(3):309-14. doi: 10.1093/ecam/neh118.,,,,['10.1093/ecam/neh118 [doi]'],,,,,PMC1193558,,,,,,,,,,,

However, mechanisms that promote survival of BCR/ABL-positive cells before clinically overt IM resistance occurs have poorly been defined so far. Here, we demonstrate that IM-treatment activated the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTor)-pathway in BCR/ABL-positive LAMA-cells and primary leukemia cells in vitro, as well as in a chronic phase CML patient in vivo. In fact, PI3K/Akt-activation critically mediated survival during the early phase of IM resistance development before manifestation of BCR/ABL-dependent strong IM resistance such as through a kinase mutation. Accordingly, inhibition of IM-induced Akt activation using mTor inhibitors and Akt-specific siRNA effectively antagonized development of incipient IM-resistance in vitro. In contrast, IM-resistant chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) patients with BCR/ABL kinase mutations (n=15), and IM-refractory BCR/ABL-positive acute lymphatic leukemia patients (n=2) displayed inconsistent and kinase mutation-independent autonomous patterns of Akt-pathway activation, and mTor-inhibition overcame IM resistance only if Akt was strongly activated. Together, an IM-induced compensatory Akt/mTor activation may represent a novel mechanism for the persistence of BCR/ABL-positive cells in IM-treated patients. Treatment with mTor inhibitors may thus be particularly effective in IM-sensitive patients, whereas Akt-pathway activation variably contributes to clinically overt IM resistance.","['Burchert, A', 'Wang, Y', 'Cai, D', 'von Bubnoff, N', 'Paschka, P', 'Muller-Brusselbach, S', 'Ottmann, O G', 'Duyster, J', 'Hochhaus, A', 'Neubauer, A']","['Burchert A', 'Wang Y', 'Cai D', 'von Bubnoff N', 'Paschka P', 'Muller-Brusselbach S', 'Ottmann OG', 'Duyster J', 'Hochhaus A', 'Neubauer A']","['Klinikum der Philipps Universitat Marburg, Klinik fur Hamatologie, Onkologie und Immunologie, Marburg, Germany. burchert@mailer.uni-marburg.de']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Benzamides', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Everolimus', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Mutagenesis', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/*metabolism', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Piperazines/*therapeutic use', 'Protein Kinases/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/genetics/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt', 'Pyrimidines/*therapeutic use', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'RNA, Small Interfering/pharmacology', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Ribosomal Protein S6 Kinases, 70-kDa/metabolism', 'Sirolimus/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2005/09/02 09:00,2005/11/05 09:00,['2005/09/02 09:00'],"['2005/09/02 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/11/05 09:00 [medline]', '2005/09/02 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2005 Oct;19(10):1774-82. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2403898.,,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', '9HW64Q8G6G (Everolimus)', 'EC 2.7.- (Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.1.1 (MTOR protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (AKT1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Ribosomal Protein S6 Kinases, 70-kDa)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'W36ZG6FT64 (Sirolimus)']",,"['2403898 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.leu.2403898 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Follow-up is ongoing, with medians of 7.9, 10.9 and 8.6 years, respectively. These three clinical trials developed dose- and time-intensive induction regimens based upon high-dose cytarabine and daunomycin and randomly assigned patients to allogeneic bone marrow transplantation in first remission if an HLA-matched related donor was identified. Despite dose- and time-intensive induction regimens, remission induction rates remained relatively stable at 77-78%. However, overall survival, event-free survival and disease-free survival (DFS) increased for patients receiving intensive-timing induction therapy in comparison to patients who received standard-timing induction, regardless of the type of postremission therapy. Outcomes were best for patients receiving intensive-timing induction followed by matched related donor allogeneic transplantation with DFS of 65+/-9% at 6 years. These three clinical trials have established a strong foundation for the development of future studies focusing on further risk group stratification and the development of novel, molecularly-targeted therapies.","['Smith, F O', 'Alonzo, T A', 'Gerbing, R B', 'Woods, W G', 'Arceci, R J']","['Smith FO', 'Alonzo TA', 'Gerbing RB', 'Woods WG', 'Arceci RJ']","[""Division of Hematology/Oncology, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center and the University of Cincinnati College of Medicine, Cincinnati, OH 45229-3039, USA. frank.smith@cchmc.org""]",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial, Phase III', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Protocols/*standards', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/mortality/*therapy', 'Male', 'Remission Induction/methods', 'Survival Analysis']",2005/09/02 09:00,2006/01/20 09:00,['2005/09/02 09:00'],"['2005/09/02 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/01/20 09:00 [medline]', '2005/09/02 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2005 Dec;19(12):2054-62. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2403925.,"['CA98413/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA98543/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,"['2403925 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.leu.2403925 [doi]']",,,"[""Children's Cancer Group""]",,,,,,,,,,,,,

POG 8101 demonstrated that the induction rate associated with the 3+7+7 combination of daunorubicin, Ara-C, and 6-thioguanine (DAT) was greater than that associated with an induction regimen used to treat acute lymphoblastic leukemia (82 vs 61%; P=0.02). Designed as a pilot study to determine the feasibility of administration of noncross-resistant drug pairs and later modified to assess the effect of dose intensification of Ara-C during the second induction course, POG 8498 confirmed the high initial rate of response to DAT (84.2%) and showed that dose intensification of Ara-C during the second induction course resulted in a trend toward higher event-free survival (EFS) estimates than did standard-dose DAT (2+5) during the second induction course (5 year EFS estimates, 22 vs 27%; P=0.33). Age <2 years and leukocyte count <100 000/mm3 emerged as significantly good prognostic factors. The most significant observation made in the POG 8498 study was the markedly superior outcome of children with Down's syndrome who were treated on the high-dose Ara-C regimen. POG 8821 compared the efficacy of autologous bone marrow transplantation (BMT) with that of intensive consolidation chemotherapy. Intent-to-treat analysis revealed similar 5-year EFS estimates for the group that underwent autologous BMT (36+/-4.7%) and for the group that received only intensive chemotherapy (35+/-4.5%) (P=0.25). There was a high rate of treatment-related mortality in the autologous transplantation group. The study demonstrated superior results of allogeneic BMT for patients with histocompatible related donors (5-year EFS estimate 63+/-5.4%) and of children with Down's syndrome (5-year EFS estimate, 66+/-8.6%). The POG 9421 AML study evaluated high-dose Ara-C as part of the first induction course and the use of the multidrug resistance modulator cyclosporine. Preliminary results showed that patients receiving both high-dose Ara-C for remission induction and the MDR modulator for consolidation had a superior outcome (5-year EFS estimate, 42+/-8.2%) than did patients receiving other treatment; however, the difference was not statistically significant. These four studies demonstrate the importance of dose intensification of Ara-C in the treatment of childhood AML; cytogenetics as the single most prognostic factor and the unique curability of AML in children with Down's syndrome.","['Ravindranath, Y', 'Chang, M', 'Steuber, C P', 'Becton, D', 'Dahl, G', 'Civin, C', 'Camitta, B', 'Carroll, A', 'Raimondi, S C', 'Weinstein, H J']","['Ravindranath Y', 'Chang M', 'Steuber CP', 'Becton D', 'Dahl G', 'Civin C', 'Camitta B', 'Carroll A', 'Raimondi SC', 'Weinstein HJ']","[""Department of Pediatrics, Children's Hospital of Michigan and Wayne State University, Detroit, MI 48201, USA. ravi@med.wayne.edu""]",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Protocols/*standards', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cytarabine/therapeutic use', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Down Syndrome/complications/drug therapy', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/complications/mortality/*therapy', 'Prognosis', 'Remission Induction/methods', 'Survival Analysis', 'Treatment Outcome']",2005/09/02 09:00,2006/01/20 09:00,['2005/09/02 09:00'],"['2005/09/02 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/01/20 09:00 [medline]', '2005/09/02 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2005 Dec;19(12):2101-16. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2403927.,"['CA-03161/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-05587/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-07431/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-11233/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-15525/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-15898/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-20549/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-25408/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-28383/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-28439/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-28476/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-29139/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-29293/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-29691/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-32053/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-33587/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-33603/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-33625/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-41573/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-69177/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-69428/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)'],,"['2403927 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.leu.2403927 [doi]']",,,['Pediatric Oncology Group'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

In contrast, its impact on the risk of adult leukemia has received little attention. METHODS: We used the lifetime residential and occupational ETS exposure histories from a population-based sample of 1068 incident and histologically confirmed adult leukemia cases and 5039 population controls age 20 to 74 years to evaluate the relationship between ETS exposure and adult leukemia risk among nonsmokers in Canada. The duration of exposure and smoker-years index were used as indices of ETS exposure. We restricted our analysis to the 266 case and 1326 control subjects who reported being lifetime nonsmokers and provided residential ETS exposure history for at least 75% of their lifetime. RESULTS: No association was found for most leukemia subtypes, and in particular for acute myeloid leukemia. In contrast, the risk for chronic lymphocytic leukemia was clearly associated with ETS exposure, with an adjusted odds ratio of 2.3 (95% confidence interval = 1.2-4.5) for more than 83 smoker-years of residential exposure and 2.4 (1.3-4.3) for more than 72 smoker-years of occupational exposure. There was a dose-response relationship for chronic lymphocytic leukemia with both indices of exposure. Risk was not higher with recent exposure, using time-window-exposure analyses. CONCLUSIONS: Regular long-term ETS exposure may be a risk factor for chronic lymphocytic leukemia.","['Kasim, Khaled', 'Levallois, Patrick', 'Abdous, Belkacem', 'Auger, Pierre', 'Johnson, Kenneth C']","['Kasim K', 'Levallois P', 'Abdous B', 'Auger P', 'Johnson KC']","['Departement de medecine sociale et preventive, Faculte de Medecine, Universite Laval, Sainte-Foy, Quebec, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Epidemiology,"Epidemiology (Cambridge, Mass.)",9009644,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Canada/epidemiology', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Chi-Square Distribution', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Leukemia/*epidemiology', 'Logistic Models', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Occupational Exposure', 'Population Surveillance', 'Registries', 'Risk', 'Surveys and Questionnaires', 'Tobacco Smoke Pollution/*adverse effects']",2005/09/02 09:00,2005/10/05 09:00,['2005/09/02 09:00'],"['2005/09/02 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/10/05 09:00 [medline]', '2005/09/02 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Epidemiology. 2005 Sep;16(5):672-80. doi: 10.1097/01.ede.0000173039.79207.80.,,['0 (Tobacco Smoke Pollution)'],,"['00001648-200509000-00012 [pii]', '10.1097/01.ede.0000173039.79207.80 [doi]']",,,['Canadian Cancer Registries Epidemiology Research Group'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

The protein is involved in multiple processes of eukaryotic DNA metabolism, including DNA replication, repair, and recombination. In Xenopus, Xenopus RPA-interacting protein alpha has been identified as a carrier molecule of RPA into the nucleus. In this study, human RPA-interacting protein alpha (hRIPalpha) and five novel splice isoforms (named hRIPalpha, hRIPbeta, hRIPgamma, hRIPdelta1, hRIPdelta2, and hRIPdelta3 according to the lengths of their encoding peptides) were cloned. Among hRIP isoforms, hRIPalpha and hRIPbeta were found to be the major splice isoforms and to show different subcellular localizations. While hRIPalpha localized to the cytoplasm, hRIPbeta was found in the PML nuclear body. Modification of hRIPbeta by sumoylation was found to be required for localization to the PML nuclear body. The results of the present work demonstrate that hRIPbeta transports RPA into the PML nuclear body and releases RPA upon UV irradiation. hRIPbeta thus plays an important role in RPA deposition in PML nuclear bodies and thereby supplements RPA for DNA metabolism.","['Park, Junsoo', 'Seo, Taegun', 'Kim, Hakzoo', 'Choe, Joonho']","['Park J', 'Seo T', 'Kim H', 'Choe J']","['Department of Biological Sciences, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Daejon 305-701, South Korea.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,IM,"['Active Transport, Cell Nucleus', 'Alternative Splicing', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Carrier Proteins/analysis/genetics/*metabolism', 'Cell Cycle/radiation effects', 'Cell Nucleus/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Cytoplasm/chemistry/metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/analysis/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Neoplasm Proteins/metabolism', 'Nuclear Localization Signals/genetics/metabolism', 'Nuclear Proteins/metabolism', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'Protein Isoforms/analysis/genetics/metabolism', 'Replication Protein A', 'S Phase/radiation effects', 'Transcription Factors/metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/metabolism', 'Ultraviolet Rays']",2005/09/02 09:00,2005/10/21 09:00,['2005/09/02 09:00'],"['2005/09/02 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/10/21 09:00 [medline]', '2005/09/02 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 2005 Sep;25(18):8202-14. doi: 10.1128/MCB.25.18.8202-8214.2005.,,"['0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Localization Signals)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (Protein Isoforms)', '0 (RPA-interacting protein alpha, human)', '0 (RPA1 protein, human)', '0 (Replication Protein A)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)']",,"['25/18/8202 [pii]', '10.1128/MCB.25.18.8202-8214.2005 [doi]']",,,,,PMC1234305,,,,,,,,,,"['GENBANK/AY680654', 'GENBANK/AY680655', 'GENBANK/AY680656', 'GENBANK/AY680657', 'GENBANK/AY680658', 'GENBANK/AY680659', 'GENBANK/AY680660']",

Introduction of point mutations in the N-terminal and C-terminal SH2 domain and SH3 domain of p85alpha, which disrupt their ability to bind phosphotyrosine and proline-rich motifs, respectively, abrogated their interaction with the BCR/ABL protein network. The p85alpha mutant protein (p85mut) bearing these mutations was unable to interact with BCR/ABL and other FTKs, while its binding to the p110alpha catalytic subunit of PI-3k was intact. In addition, binding of Shc, c-Cbl, and Gab2, but not Crk-L, to p85mut was abrogated. p85mut diminished BCR/ABL-dependent activation of PI-3k and Akt kinase, the downstream effector of PI-3k. This effect was associated with the inhibition of BCR/ABL-dependent growth of the hematopoietic cell line and murine bone marrow cells. Interestingly, the addition of interleukin-3 (IL-3) rescued BCR/ABL-transformed cells from the inhibitory effect of p85mut. SCID mice injected with BCR/ABL-positive hematopoietic cells expressing p85mut survived longer than the animals inoculated with BCR/ABL-transformed counterparts. In conclusion, we have identified the domains of p85alpha responsible for the interaction with the FTK protein network and transduction of leukemogenic signaling.","['Ren, Shu-Yue', 'Bolton, Elisabeth', 'Mohi, M Golam', 'Morrione, Andrea', 'Neel, Benjamin G', 'Skorski, Tomasz']","['Ren SY', 'Bolton E', 'Mohi MG', 'Morrione A', 'Neel BG', 'Skorski T']","['Molecular Carcinogenesis Section, Center for Biotechnology, College of Science and Technology, Temple University, BLSB 419, 1900 N. 12th Street, Philadelphia, PA 19122, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,IM,"['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing/metabolism', 'Animals', 'Cattle', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/genetics/metabolism', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/genetics/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, SCID', 'Mutation', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/*chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Phosphotyrosine/metabolism', 'Protein Interaction Mapping', 'src Homology Domains']",2005/09/02 09:00,2005/10/21 09:00,['2005/09/02 09:00'],"['2005/09/02 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/10/21 09:00 [medline]', '2005/09/02 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 2005 Sep;25(18):8001-8. doi: 10.1128/MCB.25.18.8001-8008.2005.,"['P01 DK050654/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA083700/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 DK50654/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA83700/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '21820-51-9 (Phosphotyrosine)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",,"['25/18/8001 [pii]', '10.1128/MCB.25.18.8001-8008.2005 [doi]']",,,,,PMC1234343,,,,,,,,,,,

To do so, the authors estimated the dates of peak diagnosis over a range of geographic locations including Singapore (1968-1999), Hawaii and mainland United States (1973-1999), and western Sweden (1977-1994) at latitudes of 1.16 degrees N to 58.24 degrees N. In contrast to other studies, the authors used case-by-case information on dates, gender, and age rather than grouped data for analysis. The seasonal pattern was estimated by fitting a von Mises distribution to the data from each location. No seasonal pattern was found in Singapore, which is close to the equator and does not have marked climatic changes. Likewise, seasonality was not demonstrated in Hawaii or mainland United States despite a 26.18 degrees range of latitudes. In contrast, a significant peak (early January) was observed for western Sweden that appeared strongest for males (December 22, 95% confidence interval: November 16, January 16) and those less than age 20 years (January 14, 95% confidence interval: December 8, March 27).

Recently our physician counterparts, in collaboration with oncologists, constructed a new World Health Organization (WHO) standard. WHO revisions lower the blast threshold from 30% to 20% for diagnosing acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and expand and redefine AML categories. AML is now subdivided into 4 broad groups: 1) AML with recurrent genetic abnormalities, 2) AML with multilineage dysplasia, 3) AML with previous chemotherapy and/or radiation, and 4) AML, not otherwise categorized. AML alphanumeric designations (M1, M2, etc) have been discontinued as numbers of subtypes have increased. The lower blast percentage eliminates one category of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS): refractory anemia with excess blasts in transformation. A new MDS category was created: refractory cytopenia with multilineage dysplasia (RCMD), with lineage dysplasia assessed using newly defined percentage limits. At least 10% of cells from each of 2 lineages must display atypia for a diagnosis of RCMD. That threshold is 50% for diagnosing AML with multilineage dysplasia. Chronic myelomonocytic leukemia has been removed from the MDS category and included in a new category of diseases that have features of both MDS and chronic leukemia. WHO revisions are a signal to veterinary clinical pathologists to assess the validity of our system, which was built on premises now questioned.","['McManus, Patricia M']",['McManus PM'],"['Department of Pathobiology, University of Pennsylvania, School of Veterinary Medicine, Philadelphia, PA, USA. vetpathpat@yahoo.com']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Vet Clin Pathol,Veterinary clinical pathology,9880575,IM,"['Animals', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*classification/diagnosis/veterinary', 'Lymphoma/*classification/diagnosis/veterinary', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*classification/diagnosis/veterinary']",2005/09/01 09:00,2006/03/29 09:00,['2005/09/01 09:00'],"['2005/09/01 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/03/29 09:00 [medline]', '2005/09/01 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Vet Clin Pathol. 2005 Sep;34(3):189-212. doi: 10.1111/j.1939-165x.2005.tb00042.x.,,,265,['10.1111/j.1939-165x.2005.tb00042.x [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, failure of such approaches involving interleukin-2 and/or T-cell-based immunotherapy indicated the importance of investigation of the human leucocyte antigen (HLA) status of the haematopoietic malignant cells. Considerable number of reports indicate that both HLA class I and class II are down-regulated in different cases of leukaemias, enabling them to evade immuno-surveillance. However, locus-specific down-regulation in leukaemia has not been widely investigated, although majority of cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) responses are modulated by HLA-A and HLA-B, whereas expression of only HLA-C is unable to block natural killer (NK)-cell-mediated cytotolysis. Therefore, using RT-PCR, we have investigated the HLA class I transcriptional expression in a locus-specific manner, along with HLA-associated accessory molecules beta2-microglobulin and transporter-associated antigen processing molecule (TAP1). Our data suggest that in several newly diagnosed untreated leukaemic patients, HLA-C and beta2-microglobulin are expressed, but not the locus HLA-A or -B. Moreover, TAP1 and beta2-microglobulin were observed to be down-regulated in a number of cases of leukaemia. Our flow cytometric analysis of HLA-ABC also indicates a decrease in mean fluorescent intensity but no complete loss in surface expression of HLA class Ia on the leukaemic cells. Therefore, the observed low surface expression of HLA-ABC may be due to the down-regulation of transcription of HLA-A or -B itself and/or transcriptional suppression of the accessory molecules.","['Majumder, Durjoy', 'Bandyopadhyay, Debasis', 'Chandra, Sarmila', 'Mukhopadhayay, Ashis', 'Mukherjee, Nandini', 'Bandyopadhyay, Subir K', 'Banerjee, Subrata']","['Majumder D', 'Bandyopadhyay D', 'Chandra S', 'Mukhopadhayay A', 'Mukherjee N', 'Bandyopadhyay SK', 'Banerjee S']","['Biophysics Division, Structural Genomics Section, Saha Institute of Nuclear Physics, Calcutta, India.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Immunogenetics,Immunogenetics,0420404,IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 2', 'ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters/genetics', 'HLA-A Antigens/genetics', 'HLA-B Antigens/genetics', 'HLA-C Antigens/genetics', 'HLA-DR Antigens/genetics', 'Histocompatibility Antigens Class I/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/genetics/*immunology', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'beta 2-Microglobulin/genetics']",2005/09/01 09:00,2005/11/04 09:00,['2005/09/01 09:00'],"['2005/03/28 00:00 [received]', '2005/06/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2005/09/01 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/11/04 09:00 [medline]', '2005/09/01 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Immunogenetics. 2005 Sep;57(8):579-89. doi: 10.1007/s00251-005-0018-9.

Some data indicate that leukapheresis products may also contain non-hematopoietic stem cells, as they occur in whole bone marrow transplantation (BMT). However, there is still controversy whether MSC expand in the host after transplantation like blood progenitor cells do. Therefore, we were interested in finding out if graft MSC can be detected in leukapheresis products and in bone marrow after BMT and peripheral blood stem cell transplantation (PBSCT). Every sample from total bone marrow transplants exhibited growth of MSC after in vitro culture, but not one of nine leukapheresis products did. In addition, bone marrow aspirates of 9 patients receiving BMT and of 18 patients after PBSCT were examined for origin of MSC. Almost all MSC samples exhibited a complete host profile, whereas peripheral blood cells were of donor origin.

Some morphologic subtypes are specifically associated to distinct cytogenetic and molecular aberrations; however, such close correlations do not exist for the majority of entities. We evaluated cytogenetics in 2,235 patients at diagnosis of AML with the FAB subtypes M0-2, M4, and M5-7. The cytogenetic patterns of these subtypes showed differences with respect to the clonal aberration rate and the incidence of complex aberrant karyotypes. The frequency of numerical gains and losses and of structural losses and the incidence of 11q23/MLL rearrangements differed. Thus, cytomorphology of AML may be helpful to support or even initiate other diagnostic procedures, e.g., interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization and polymerase chain reaction. In conclusion, the central role of morphology as defined by the FAB and WHO classification in AML at diagnosis is still justified in combination with other techniques.","['Bacher, Ulrike', 'Kern, Wolfgang', 'Schnittger, Susanne', 'Hiddemann, Wolfgang', 'Schoch, Claudia', 'Haferlach, Torsten']","['Bacher U', 'Kern W', 'Schnittger S', 'Hiddemann W', 'Schoch C', 'Haferlach T']","['Laboratory for Leukemia Diagnostics, Department for Internal Medicine III, University Hospital Grosshadern, Ludwig Maximilians University, Marchioninistr. 15, 81377, Munich, Germany. ulrike.bacher@med.uni-muenchen.de']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Germany,Ann Hematol,Annals of hematology,9107334,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', '*Chromosome Aberrations', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 11/genetics', 'Female', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*classification/genetics/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/genetics', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Retrospective Studies', 'World Health Organization']",2005/09/01 09:00,2006/03/03 09:00,['2005/09/01 09:00'],"['2005/06/22 00:00 [received]', '2005/07/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2005/09/01 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/03/03 09:00 [medline]', '2005/09/01 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Ann Hematol. 2005 Nov;84(12):785-91. doi: 10.1007/s00277-005-1099-0.

They are also often unrecognized by clinicians. This review summarizes the principal epidemiologic studies on this topic. METHODS: We analyzed the recent relevant human data found in the Medline, the Pascal and the BDSP databases. RESULTS: Benzene and ionizing radiation are the only agents conclusively demonstrated to be carcinogenic to the haematopoietic system. In particular, both exposures are strongly associated with acute myeloid leukaemia. Low doses of both may also be related to myeloid malignancies. Infectious agents and pesticides are also thought to induce lymphoproliferative cancers. Some studies show an association between haematological malignancies and low-frequency electromagnetic fields and organic solvents. All of these suspected occupational causes must be confirmed by further studies. CONCLUSIONS: Better knowledge and understanding of occupational causes of haematological malignancies are necessary to improve their prevention and compensation.","['Descatha, Alexis', 'Jenabian, Arash', 'Conso, Francoise', 'Ameille, Jacques']","['Descatha A', 'Jenabian A', 'Conso F', 'Ameille J']","['Unite de pathologie professionnelle et de sante au travail, Hopital R.

METHODS: Crop and pesticide exposures were estimated by linking county/month and crop specific job history information from union records with California Department of Pesticide Regulation pesticide use reports during the 20-year period prior to cancer diagnosis. RESULTS: A total of 131 LHC diagnosed in California between 1988 and 2001 were included in the analysis. Analyses were conducted by gender and subtype of non-Hodgkins lymphoma (nodal, extra nodal) and by leukemia histology (lymphocytic, granulocytic). Odds ratios were calculated by stratification and by unconditional logistic regression. Risk for all LHC was elevated in workers cultivating vegetables (OR = 1.67, 95% CI = 1.12-2.48). Risk of leukemia was associated with exposure to the pesticides mancozeb (OR = 2.35, 95% CI = 1.12-4.95) and toxaphene (OR = 2.20, 95% CI = 1.04-4.65) while NHL risk was increased in association with 2,4-D (OR = 3.80, 95% CI=1.85-7.81). Risk of leukemia was particularly elevated among female workers and for granulocytic versus lymphocytic leukemia for several chemicals. No associations were noted for multiple myeloma. CONCLUSIONS: California farm workers employed where mancozeb and toxaphene were used had an increased risk of leukemia compared to farm workers employed elsewhere. Employment in farms using 2,4-D was associated with an increased risk of NHL.","['Mills, Paul K', 'Yang, Richard', 'Riordan, Deborah']","['Mills PK', 'Yang R', 'Riordan D']","['Cancer Registry of Central California/Public Health Institute, 1320 E.

Diffusion-weighted MRI (DWI) may help to distinguish between ischemic stroke and chemotherapy-related leukoencephalopathy. Although conventional MRI correlates have been described for this stroke-like syndrome, DWI data are largely unavailable. Our objective is to present a retrospective analysis of the DWI findings in four patients who suffered subacute neurotoxicity after intrathecal MTX. DESIGN: We reviewed the medical records of four patients, who were seen by us between July 2000 and February 2004 for sudden onset of a central neurological syndrome within days of intrathecal MTX. Patients underwent standardized MRI within 48 h of symptom onset; MRI included DWI and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps. RESULTS: DWI of all patients revealed well-demarcated hyperintense lesions within the subcortical white matter corresponding to areas of restricted proton diffusion on ADC maps. Lesions exceeded the confines of adjacent vascular territories. Complete resolution of symptoms within 1-4 days was accompanied by normalization of ADC abnormalities. CONCLUSIONS: DWI findings in this cohort seem to reflect cytotoxic edema within cerebral white matter suggesting a reversible metabolic derangement, rather than ischemia, as the basis for this syndrome.","['Haykin, Me', 'Gorman, M', 'van Hoff, J', 'Fulbright, Rk', 'Baehring, Jm']","['Haykin M', 'Gorman M', 'van Hoff J', 'Fulbright R', 'Baehring J']","['Department of Neurology, Yale University School of Medicine, TMP 410, New Haven, CT 06510, USA.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",United States,J Neurooncol,Journal of neuro-oncology,8309335,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/*adverse effects', 'Brain/*pathology', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Edema/chemically induced/pathology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, B-Cell/complications/drug therapy/pathology', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Methotrexate/*adverse effects', 'Neurotoxicity Syndromes/*pathology', 'Retrospective Studies']",2005/09/01 09:00,2006/04/06 09:00,['2005/09/01 09:00'],"['2005/09/01 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/04/06 09:00 [medline]', '2005/09/01 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Neurooncol. 2006 Jan;76(2):153-7. doi: 10.1007/s11060-005-4569-2.,,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",,['10.1007/s11060-005-4569-2 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

OBJECTIVE: We investigated the sensitivity and specificity of the GHRH-arginine test using ITT as the gold standard in diagnosing GHD in a group of young adults treated with cranial irradiation (CRT) for childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). We estimated the positive and negative predictive values of the GHRH-arginine test among patients as well as a number of individual characteristics and therapy-related factors during both the GHRH-arginine test and ITT. DESIGN: Forty-three young adults, treated for childhood ALL with 18-30 Gy CRT and chemotherapy, were studied, and comparison was made with matched controls. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: We evaluated four different cutoff levels for GHD in the GHRH-arginine test: 5, 7.5, 9, and 16.5 microg/liter. Using 7.5 microg/liter as the cutoff yielded high specificity (94%), but at the same time the sensitivity was only 66%, which leads to a low negative predictive value (27%). In contrast, a failed GH response to the GHRH-arginine test accurately reflects the presence of radiation-induced GHD, illustrated by a high positive predictive value (95% at 7.5 microg/liter).

However, recent work suggests that genes associated with the myeloid lineage are transcribed in mouse HSCs. Here, we explore whether myeloid genes are actually translated in human HSCs. We show that CD33, CD13, and CD123, well-established myeloid markers, are expressed on human long-term repopulating cells from cord blood and bone marrow. In addition, we demonstrate that nonobese diabetic/severe combined immunodeficiency (NOD/SCID) leukemia-initiating cells (SL-ICs) are restricted to the CD33+ fraction in 11 of 12 acute myeloid leukemia (AML) samples studied, indicating that leukemic stem cells (LSCs) express this antigen. This study changes our view of HSCs and the process of differentiation. Furthermore, based on the phenotypic similarity of HSCs and LSCs, our data provide support for the hypothesis that AML derives from an HSC. Our findings also provide a challenge to contemporary attempts to improve the outcome of AML using myeloid antigen-targeted therapies, given the potential for HSC killing.","['Taussig, David C', 'Pearce, Daniel J', 'Simpson, Catherine', 'Rohatiner, Ama Z', 'Lister, T Andrew', 'Kelly, Gavin', 'Luongo, Jennifer L', 'Danet-Desnoyers, Gwenn-Ael H', 'Bonnet, Dominique']","['Taussig DC', 'Pearce DJ', 'Simpson C', 'Rohatiner AZ', 'Lister TA', 'Kelly G', 'Luongo JL', 'Danet-Desnoyers GA', 'Bonnet D']","['Haematopoietic Stem Cell Laboratory, Cancer Research UK, London Research Institute.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, CD/*metabolism', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*metabolism', 'Fetal Blood/metabolism', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*metabolism/*therapy', 'Mice', 'Mice, SCID', 'Phenotype', 'Sensitivity and Specificity']",2005/09/01 09:00,2006/01/07 09:00,['2005/09/01 09:00'],"['2005/09/01 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/01/07 09:00 [medline]', '2005/09/01 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 2005 Dec 15;106(13):4086-92. doi: 10.1182/blood-2005-03-1072.

Inhibitors of PNP failed until structure-based synthesis of immucillin-H (BCX-1777, forodesine), a transition-state analog of PNP. The picomolar potency for PNP, T cell-selective cytotoxicity, and animal studies provided the rationale for use of forodesine in T-cell malignancies. Five patients were treated with an intravenous infusion of forodesine (40 mg/m2) on day 1; treatment continued on day 2; forodesine was administered every 12 hours for an additional 8 doses. Plasma and cellular pharmacokinetics and pharmaco-dynamics were investigated. Median peak level of forodesine (5.4 microM) was achieved at the end of infusion. This level was sufficient to increase plasma 2'-deoxyguanosine (dGuo) concentrations in all patients. Intracellular deoxyguanosine triphosphate (dGTP) increased by 2- to 40-fold in 4 of 5 patients (8 of 9 courses) and correlated with antileukemia activity in 4 patients.

The outcomes for 54 patients with chronic-phase (CP) and 26 with advanced-phase (AP) disease were as follows: overall survival, 85% +/- 5% versus 36% +/- 10%; transplantation-related mortality (TRM), 13% +/- 5% versus 43% +/- 11%; and current leukemia-free survival, 76% +/- 6% versus 34% +/- 9%.

Higher-than-median LC30 correlated significantly with molecular remission (MR) at 3, 6, and 12 months and with higher CD34 doses. Lymphocyte subset analysis performed in 20 patients available for phenotyping showed that LC30 was highly correlated with absolute CD56+CD3- natural killer cell numbers (NK30), which also predicted for survival and MR. CD34 cell dose, LC30, and NK30, but not day-30 CD3+ cell count, were highly correlated and were significant predictors of transplantation outcome.

CASE SUMMARY: A 36-year-old male presenting with productive cough, abdominal pain, and lower back pain was diagnosed with pre-B cell ALL. Of note, the patient developed worsening LFT results within the first few days of diagnosis. Because of concern over increasing liver dysfunction and the need to administer vincristine and daunorubicin with induction therapy, a transvenous liver biopsy was performed, revealing massive lymphoblast infiltration. DISCUSSION: A short course of prednisone was given to determine whether the LFT abnormalities would reverse with treatment. Once a downward trend in the abnormalities was noted, full-dose induction chemotherapy was administered. CONCLUSIONS: It is important to discern the cause of elevated LFT values in patients with acute leukemia who require induction chemotherapy, as this may affect treatment decisions and patient outcomes.","['Comeau, Terrance B', 'Phillips, Debra L']","['Comeau TB', 'Phillips DL']","['Bone Marrow and Stem Cell Transplantation Program, Division of Hematology and Medical Oncology, School of Medicine, The University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, NC, USA.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",United States,Ann Pharmacother,The Annals of pharmacotherapy,9203131,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', '*Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/administration & dosage/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Daunorubicin/administration & dosage/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Liver/drug effects/*physiopathology', 'Liver Function Tests', 'Male', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/physiopathology', 'Prednisone/administration & dosage/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Vincristine/administration & dosage/adverse effects/therapeutic use']",2005/09/01 09:00,2006/01/07 09:00,['2005/09/01 09:00'],"['2005/09/01 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/01/07 09:00 [medline]', '2005/09/01 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Ann Pharmacother. 2005 Oct;39(10):1752-4. doi: 10.1345/aph.1G223.

The aim of the study was to measure circulating endothelial cells (CEC), circulating endothelial precursors (CEP) and activated endothelial cells (aCEC) and serum concentrations of VEGF (vascular endothelial growth factor) and bFGF (basic fibroblast growth factor), well-known proangiogenic factors in patients with haematological malignancies before and after chemotherapy. Measurements were carried out in 20 patients with acute leukemia, 21 with malignant lymphoma and with 20 with multiple myeloma. The number of CEC, CEP and aCEC was measured by means of 3-color flow cytometry and serum concentrations of VEGF and bFGF with ELISA. In patients with acute leukemias and lymphomas the number of CEC was significantly higher than in controls, and that high number correlated with worse prognosis in patients with lymphomas. The increased number of CEP at diagnosis in patients with acute leukemia and lymphoma correlated with worse prognosis. The number of aCEC was higher in leukemic and lymphoma groups. After chemotherapy the decrease in CEC and CEP numbers in patients with acute leukemia and lymphoma was observed. In patients with lymphoma the increased serum VEGF concentrations in comparison with healthy subjects were noted but in leukemic patients-lower concentrations of VEGF. The initial high concentrations of bFGF in all patients did not change after therapy and in patients with lymphoma correlated with worse prognosis. Results suggest that in patients with acute leukemias and lymphomas CEC and CEP may be the markers of malignant process correlating with clinical outcome. aCEC may have a similar role in both diseases. Also in patients with lymphoma VEGF may be a marker of disease activity. bFGF is connected with pathogenesis of acute leukemia, myeloma and lymphoma and in patients with lymphoma is a predictor of worse prognosis.","['Poreba, Malgorzata', 'Jazwiec, Bozena', 'Kuliczkowski, Kazimierz', 'Poreba, Rafal']","['Poreba M', 'Jazwiec B', 'Kuliczkowski K', 'Poreba R']","['Katedra i Klinika Hematologii, Nowotworow Krwi i Transplantacji Szpiku AM we Wroclawiu.']",['pol'],"['Comparative Study', 'English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Poland,Pol Arch Med Wewn,Polskie Archiwum Medycyny Wewnetrznej,0401225,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Biomarkers/blood', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Endothelial Cells/*metabolism', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Female', 'Fibroblast Growth Factor 2/*blood', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*blood/physiopathology', 'Lymphoma/*blood/physiopathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multiple Myeloma/*blood/physiopathology', 'Neovascularization, Pathologic/blood', 'Prognosis', 'Risk Factors', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A/*blood']",2005/09/01 09:00,2005/10/15 09:00,['2005/09/01 09:00'],"['2005/09/01 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/10/15 09:00 [medline]', '2005/09/01 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Pol Arch Med Wewn. 2005 Jan;113(1):27-34.,,"['0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A)', '103107-01-3 (Fibroblast Growth Factor 2)']",,,"Krazace komorki srodblonka, prekursory srodblonka oraz stezenie VEGF i bFGF u chorych na ostre bialaczki, chloniaki i szpiczaki.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, there is little empirical evidence to suggest people's awareness of the survivability of different cancers. The object of the present study was to determine people's estimates of the survivability of 10 cancers. METHODS: In 2001, data were collected via computer-assisted telephone interviews with 1,501 randomly selected metropolitan and rural Western Australian adults. Participants were presented with a list of 10 cancers. Half the sample was asked to nominate the three most survivable, and half was asked to nominate the three least survivable cancers. RESULTS: Participants' rankings of the 10 cancers in terms of perceived survivability were consistent with cancer registry data, with the exception of bone cancer which was underrated. Respondents' average estimates of five-year survival rates were also accurate (+/- 2-6%) for cancers with relatively high survival rates such as breast, cervical, prostate, and other skin cancers, with the exception of melanoma, which was underestimated (20%). However, average estimated survival rates for cancers with low survivability, such as leukaemia, lung, and stomach cancers, were substantially overestimated, being 31%, 38% and 43% higher respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Western Australians appear to have a reasonable understanding of the relative survivability of various cancers but a poorer appreciation of actual survival rates.","['Jones, Sandra C', 'Carter, Owen B J', 'Donovan, Robert J', 'Jalleh, Geoffrey']","['Jones SC', 'Carter OB', 'Donovan RJ', 'Jalleh G']","['Centre for Health Behaviour Research in Cancer Control, Curtin University of Technology, Western Australia. sandraj@uow.edu.au']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Australia,Health Promot J Austr,Health promotion journal of Australia : official journal of Australian Association of Health Promotion Professionals,9710936,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Female', 'Health Education/methods', '*Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice', 'Health Surveys', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms/mortality/*psychology', 'Social Perception', 'Survival Analysis', '*Survivors', 'Western Australia/epidemiology']",2005/09/01 09:00,2005/10/27 09:00,['2005/09/01 09:00'],"['2005/09/01 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/10/27 09:00 [medline]', '2005/09/01 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Health Promot J Austr. 2005 Aug;16(2):124-8. doi: 10.1071/he05124.,,,,['10.1071/he05124 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

RESULTS: TTR was present in all the eye structures except the lens and tear. The retina and the vitreous had relatively higher amounts of TTR compared with aqueous. The identity of TTR was confirmed by immuno-electrophoresis using anti-human TTR. Two bands in SDS electrophoresis revealed that this protein is a heterodimer. There was a significant decrease in vitreous TTR in diabetes with hypertension and increase in one case each of diabetes with hypertension associated with leukaemia or carcinoma with hepato-splenomegaly. CONCLUSION: Vitreous TTR is probably from retina and retinal pigment epithelium. The level of vitreous TTR is likely to have diagnostic significance in some retinal diseases.","['Ramakrishnan, S', 'Sulochana, K N', 'Parikh, S', 'Punitham, R']","['Ramakrishnan S', 'Sulochana KN', 'Parikh S', 'Punitham R']","['Biochemistry Research Department, Vision Research Foundation, Chennai, India.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],India,Indian J Ophthalmol,Indian journal of ophthalmology,0405376,IM,"['Adult', 'Diabetes Complications/*metabolism', 'Eye/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Hypertension/complications/*metabolism', 'Neoplasms/complications/*metabolism', 'Prealbumin/*metabolism', 'Vitreous Body/*metabolism']",2005/09/01 09:00,2005/12/13 09:00,['2005/09/01 09:00'],"['2005/09/01 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/12/13 09:00 [medline]', '2005/09/01 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Indian J Ophthalmol. 1999 Mar;47(1):31-4.,,['0 (Prealbumin)'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: In this multicenter, Canadian, retrospective cohort study, 800 survivors age 17 years or younger were matched by age and gender with a group of 923 control participants. Using a mailed survey that was completed by parents, educational outcomes were assessed with questions about the child's enrollment in disability or special-education programs, repeating a grade, and academic or other school problems. Using friendships was the measure of social outcomes. RESULTS: Based on parental reports, significantly more survivors than controls repeated a grade (21% vs. 9%), attended learning-disability (19% vs. 7%) or special-education programs (20% vs. 8%), had educational or other school problems (46% vs. 23%), had no close friends (19% vs. 8%), and were less likely to use friends as confidants (58% vs. 67%). Survivors of central nervous system (CNS) tumors reportedly were more likely than controls to have educational problems and no close friends, followed by survivors of leukemia, and survivors of neuroblastoma. Among survivors, cranial radiation increased the likelihood of having educational difficulties and having no close friends compared with survivors who did not receive cranial radiation. Survivors who reportedly had high self-esteem and whose parents had postsecondary education had fewer educational and social problems. CONCLUSIONS: Children and adolescents who survived cancer, particularly those who had CNS tumors, leukemia, and neuroblastoma, required close monitoring for early educational and social difficulties, and such children should be offered educational rehabilitation and social skills training to maximize their academic and social success.","['Barrera, Maru', 'Shaw, Amanda K', 'Speechley, Kathy N', 'Maunsell, Elizabeth', 'Pogany, Lisa']","['Barrera M', 'Shaw AK', 'Speechley KN', 'Maunsell E', 'Pogany L']","['Department of Psychology, Haematology/Oncology Program, Population Health Sciences, Research Institute, Hospital for Sick Children, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada. maru.barrera@sickkids.ca']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cohort Studies', '*Educational Status', 'Employment', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/mortality/*psychology', 'Parents', 'Retrospective Studies', '*Social Behavior', 'Survivors']",2005/09/01 09:00,2006/01/13 09:00,['2005/09/01 09:00'],"['2005/09/01 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/01/13 09:00 [medline]', '2005/09/01 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer. 2005 Oct 15;104(8):1751-60. doi: 10.1002/cncr.21390.,,,,['10.1002/cncr.21390 [doi]'],,['Copyright 2005 American Cancer Society'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

OBJECTIVE: To raise awareness among spinal cord clinicians of the possible carcinogenic effect of phenoxybenzamine and of the rare occurrence of small cell carcinoma in the neuropathic bladder. SETTING: Regional Spinal Injuries Centre and District General Hospital, Southport, Merseyside, United Kingdom. CASE REPORT: A 28-year-old man sustained a fracture dislocation of L-1 with consequent paraplegia (ASIA impairment scale A). Phenoxybenzamine treatment enabled his indwelling catheter to be discarded in favour of a penile sheath, but it caused unacceptable dizziness and was stopped after 7 years. After 20 years, he developed chronic lymphocytic leukaemia, which was treated with chlorambucil and fludarabine. After 2 years, investigation of bilateral hydronephrosis revealed a primary small cell carcinoma of the bladder with coexistent squamous dysplasia. Uraemia supervened and, declining active treatment, the patient died 3 weeks after diagnosis. CONCLUSION: Phenoxybenzamine, a known carcinogen in rodents, is likely also to be carcinogenic in humans, and patients with spinal cord injury who have received the drug for any significant period of time, need close follow-up to allow early detection of cancer. Phenoxybenzamine should not be prescribed on a long-term basis, and should instead be replaced with a selective alpha-blocker.","['Vaidyanathan, S', 'Mansour, P', 'Soni, B M', 'Hughes, P L', 'Singh, G']","['Vaidyanathan S', 'Mansour P', 'Soni BM', 'Hughes PL', 'Singh G']","['Regional Spinal Injuries Centre, District General Hospital, Southport, Merseyside, UK.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",England,Spinal Cord,Spinal cord,9609749,IM,"['Adult', 'CD56 Antigen/metabolism', 'Carcinoma, Small Cell/*chemically induced/pathology', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry/methods', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*chemically induced/metabolism/pathology', 'Leukocyte Common Antigens/metabolism', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging/methods', 'Male', 'Neoplasms, Squamous Cell/*chemically induced/pathology', 'Paraplegia/drug therapy/rehabilitation', 'Phenoxybenzamine/*adverse effects', 'Time', 'Urinary Bladder Neoplasms/*chemically induced/pathology', 'Vasodilator Agents/*adverse effects']",2005/09/01 09:00,2006/05/10 09:00,['2005/09/01 09:00'],"['2005/09/01 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/05/10 09:00 [medline]', '2005/09/01 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Spinal Cord. 2006 Mar;44(3):188-91. doi: 10.1038/sj.sc.3101789.,,"['0 (CD56 Antigen)', '0 (Vasodilator Agents)', '0TTZ664R7Z (Phenoxybenzamine)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Leukocyte Common Antigens)']",,"['3101789 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.sc.3101789 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Several TS gene polymorphisms correlate with variable TS expression: a double (2R) and triple (3R) 28-bp repeat element, a G to C substitution of the 3R allele and a 6 bp variation in 3'UTR. We have previously shown that childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) patients who are homozygous for the 3R allele had reduced event-free survival (EFS) probabilities. Here, we analyzed all three polymorphisms in an extended group of ALL patients (n=259). The effect of the 3R homozygosity on ALL outcome was confirmed (P=0.006), whereas 6 bp polymorphism did not influence EFS when analyzed separately. No significant difference among 3R3R genotype subgroups, as defined by a G to C substitution, was observed. The haplotype analysis revealed the higher frequency of the 3RC/6 bp+ haplotype (P=0.04) and the protective role of the 2R/6b p- (P=0.04). Consequently, homozygosity for the 6 bp- allele appeared to reduce an event-predisposing effect of 3R variant.

In parallel, the possibility that it may also be involved in the pathogenesis of stress-induced early embryonic death seems to emerge from studies, which addressed the embryotoxic potential of another cytokine, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha). In this brief review, we discuss this possibility based on these studies as well as on those addressing TNF-alpha and LIF signaling. METHODS: Existing data were reviewed critically. RESULTS: Data summarized in this review suggest that: (1) TNF-alpha may act as a mediator of stress-induced early embryonic death, (2) TNF-alpha-mediated early embryonic death induced by some detrimental stimuli may be attributed to a dysfunction of mechanisms, which are critical for the ability of the uterus to become receptive to blastocysts, allowing implantation, (3) one such mechanism was shown to be associated with LIF signaling in uterine cells, and (4) TNF-alpha seems to have the potential to affect LIF signaling. CONCLUSION: Data presented in the this review suggest LIF as a good candidate for further studies addressing molecular mechanisms underlying stress-induced early embryonic death.","['Torchinsky, A', 'Markert, U R', 'Toder, V']","['Torchinsky A', 'Markert UR', 'Toder V']","['Department of Cell and Developmental Biology, Sackler School of Medicine, Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv, Israel.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",Switzerland,Chem Immunol Allergy,Chemical immunology and allergy,101183835,IM,"['Animals', 'Blastocyst/immunology', 'Female', 'Fetal Death/*etiology/immunology', 'Interleukin-6/*immunology', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Mice', 'Pregnancy', 'Signal Transduction', 'Stress, Physiological/immunology', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/*immunology', 'Uterus/immunology']",2005/09/01 09:00,2005/11/03 09:00,['2005/09/01 09:00'],"['2005/09/01 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/11/03 09:00 [medline]', '2005/09/01 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Chem Immunol Allergy. 2005;89:62-71. doi: 10.1159/000087913.,,"['0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)']",44,"['000087913 [pii]', '10.1159/000087913 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,10.1159/000087913 [doi]

The comparison of trophoblast cells with their malignant counterpart, human choriocarcinoma cells, offers an attractive model to understand the origin or development of malignant growth. Several cytokines and growth factors are known to influence trophoblast migration (e.g. EGF, IGF-2, HGF), proliferation (e.g. leptin, HGF, GM-CSF) and/or invasion (e.g. leukemia inhibitory factor, LIF), each factor utilizing at least one pathway for intracellular signaling in the trophoblast. Two pathways that are crossed especially often mediate the signals of these factors and are simultaneously well established in terms of tumor invasion: the Janus kinase-signal transducers and activators of transcription (Jak-Stat) and receptor-associated tyrosine kinase-mitogen-activated protein kinase (RTK-MAPK) pathways. These two pathways are detrimental for reproduction in general, and in part for placenta development, as a series of knockout experiments demonstrate. Aspects of each pathway are also implicated to be involved in trophoblast invasion, e.g. STAT3 is constitutively activated in invasive first trimester trophoblast cells, and activated ERK is detectable in intermediate trophoblast cells, an invasive phenotype. Interaction at several intersection points between the pathways has been described in several cell systems so that the same would seem to be possible in trophoblast cells. In this review, some of the possible areas of interaction are alluded to.","['Fitzgerald, Justine S', 'Busch, Susann', 'Wengenmayer, Tobias', 'Foerster, Katharina', 'de la Motte, Torben', 'Poehlmann, Tobias G', 'Markert, Udo R']","['Fitzgerald JS', 'Busch S', 'Wengenmayer T', 'Foerster K', 'de la Motte T', 'Poehlmann TG', 'Markert UR']","['Department of Obstetrics, Friedrich Schiller University, Jena, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",Switzerland,Chem Immunol Allergy,Chemical immunology and allergy,101183835,IM,"['Animals', '*Cell Movement', 'Humans', 'Neoplasms/metabolism/pathology', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/metabolism', '*Signal Transduction', 'Trophoblasts/*cytology/*metabolism', 'ras Proteins/metabolism']",2005/09/01 09:00,2005/12/13 09:00,['2005/09/01 09:00'],"['2005/09/01 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/12/13 09:00 [medline]', '2005/09/01 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Chem Immunol Allergy. 2005;88:181-199. doi: 10.1159/000087834.,,"['EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (ras Proteins)']",99,"['000087834 [pii]', '10.1159/000087834 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,10.1159/000087834 [doi]

Moreover, human and mouse embryonic stem cells express Kit transcripts. Stem cell factor exists as both a soluble and a membrane-bound glycoprotein while Kit is a receptor protein-tyrosine kinase. The complete absence of stem cell factor or Kit is lethal. Deficiencies of either produce defects in red and white blood cell production, hypopigmentation, and sterility. Gain-of-function mutations of Kit are associated with several human neoplasms including acute myelogenous leukemia, gastrointestinal stromal tumors, and mastocytomas. Kit consists of an extracellular domain, a transmembrane segment, a juxtamembrane segment, and a protein kinase domain that contains an insert of about 80 amino acid residues. Binding of stem cell factor to Kit results in receptor dimerization and activation of protein kinase activity. The activated receptor becomes autophosphorylated at tyrosine residues that serve as docking sites for signal transduction molecules containing SH2 domains. The adaptor protein APS, Src family kinases, and Shp2 tyrosyl phosphatase bind to phosphotyrosine 568. Shp1 tyrosyl phosphatase and the adaptor protein Shc bind to phosphotyrosine 570. C-terminal Src kinase homologous kinase and the adaptor Shc bind to both phosphotyrosines 568 and 570. These residues occur in the juxtamembrane segment of Kit. Three residues in the kinase insert domain are phosphorylated and attract the adaptor protein Grb2 (Tyr703), phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (Tyr721), and phospholipase Cgamma (Tyr730). Phosphotyrosine 900 in the distal kinase domain binds phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase which in turn binds the adaptor protein Crk. Phosphotyrosine 936, also in the distal kinase domain, binds the adaptor proteins APS, Grb2, and Grb7. Kit has the potential to participate in multiple signal transduction pathways as a result of interaction with several enzymes and adaptor proteins.","['Roskoski, Robert Jr']",['Roskoski R Jr'],"['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Louisiana State University Health Sciences Center, 1100 Florida Avenue, New Orleans, LA 70119, USA. biocrr@lsuhsc.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Biochem Biophys Res Commun,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,0372516,IM,"['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing/metabolism', 'Animals', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/metabolism', 'Phospholipase C gamma', 'Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases/metabolism', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit/chemistry/*metabolism', '*Signal Transduction', 'Type C Phospholipases/metabolism']",2005/09/01 09:00,2005/11/15 09:00,['2005/09/01 09:00'],"['2005/08/04 00:00 [received]', '2005/08/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2005/09/01 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/11/15 09:00 [medline]', '2005/09/01 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Biochem Biophys Res Commun. 2005 Nov 11;337(1):1-13. doi: 10.1016/j.bbrc.2005.08.055.,,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases)', 'EC 3.1.4.- (Type C Phospholipases)', 'EC 3.1.4.3 (Phospholipase C gamma)']",60,"['S0006-291X(05)01759-6 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bbrc.2005.08.055 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The excellent short-term results of imatinib have changed attitudes, and the number of transplantations for CML have declined rapidly since 1999.

We report a case of nephrotic syndrome and rapidly progressive renal failure occurring in a young woman 3 years after allogeneic stem cell transplantation from her HLA-identical brother. In the renal biopsy, a diffuse mononuclear cell infiltrate was observed. Furthermore, histological analysis, immunofluorescence, and electron microscopy of the kidney specimen defined the diagnosis as minimal change disease, a T-cell-mediated glomerulopathy associated with lymphoproliferative disorders, but that has never been described as an isolated manifestation of cGVHD. METHODS: The differential diagnosis was performed by using immunohistochemistry and laser capture microdissection combined with Taq-Man quantitative polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: Infiltrating mononuclear cells in renal tissue consisted of T cells expressing DNA levels of a Y chromosome-specific gene quantitatively similar to those observed in a male subject, showing that these cells derived from the transplant donor and definitely excluding leukemia relapse. However, the large number of infiltrating T cells allowed the possibility that in this patient, minimal change disease could be related to an atypical form of GVHD. CONCLUSION: This is the first study to use molecular techniques to show the differential diagnosis of nephrotic syndrome after allogeneic stem cell transplantation. This novel method approach might represent a key tool to characterize kidney infiltrate after allogeneic stem cell transplantation.","['Romagnani, Paola', 'Lazzeri, Elena', 'Mazzinghi, Benedetta', 'Lasagni, Laura', 'Guidi, Stefano', 'Bosi, Alberto', 'Cirami, Calogero', 'Salvadori, Maurizio']","['Romagnani P', 'Lazzeri E', 'Mazzinghi B', 'Lasagni L', 'Guidi S', 'Bosi A', 'Cirami C', 'Salvadori M']","['Department of Clinical Pathophysiology, Center for Research, Transfer and High Education DE NOVO Therapies, University of Florence, Italy. p.romagnani@dfc.unifi.it']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Am J Kidney Dis,American journal of kidney diseases : the official journal of the National Kidney Foundation,8110075,IM,"['Acute Kidney Injury/*diagnosis/etiology', 'Adult', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/chemistry/immunology/*transplantation', 'Chromosomes, Human, Y/genetics', 'DNA/analysis', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Disease Progression', 'Female', 'Genetic Markers', 'Graft vs Host Disease/*diagnosis/etiology', 'Humans', 'Kidney/*pathology', 'Leukemic Infiltration/diagnosis', 'Living Donors', 'Male', 'Nephrosis, Lipoid/*diagnosis/etiology', 'Nephrotic Syndrome/*diagnosis/etiology', 'Peripheral Blood Stem Cell Transplantation/*adverse effects', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/surgery', 'Transplantation, Homologous/*adverse effects/immunology']",2005/09/01 09:00,2005/10/26 09:00,['2005/09/01 09:00'],"['2005/03/25 00:00 [received]', '2005/05/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2005/09/01 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/10/26 09:00 [medline]', '2005/09/01 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Am J Kidney Dis. 2005 Sep;46(3):550-6. doi: 10.1053/j.ajkd.2005.05.026.,,"['0 (Genetic Markers)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",,"['S0272-6386(05)00776-6 [pii]', '10.1053/j.ajkd.2005.05.026 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We examined the gene expression profiles associated with exposure to IPA using cDNA microarrays and compared the results with those obtained with other inducers of differentiation, such as all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA), 1 alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (VD3) and cotylenin A (CN-A). Many genes were up-regulated, and only a small fraction were down-regulated, upon exposure to the inducers.

We also examined the expression of other S100 proteins, including S100A8, S100A9 and S100A12, and found that IPA preferentially up-regulated S100P at the early stages of differentiation.

It is concluded that the established FQ-RT-PCR method is accurate and specific. The expression of WT1 gene is relatively high in all types of leukemias compared with normal peripheral blood cells, the higher WT1 expression may associate with poor prognosis in acute leukemia, and the dynamics of WT1 level correlate with the disease status. The quantitative assessment of WT1 expression in peripheral blood samples by FQ-RT-PCR may be a useful tool for monitoring minimal residual disease.","['Bai, Bo', 'Wang, Hong-Wei', 'Xu, Yong-Qun', 'Yang, Hei-Nu', 'Qiao, Zhen-Hua']","['Bai B', 'Wang HW', 'Xu YQ', 'Yang HN', 'Qiao ZH']","['Department of Hematology, The Second Hospital of Shanxi Medical University, Taiyuan 030001, China.']",['chi'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",China,Zhongguo Shi Yan Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi,Zhongguo shi yan xue ye xue za zhi,101084424,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/genetics', 'Child', 'Female', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/blood/*genetics/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm, Residual/blood/diagnosis/genetics', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction/*methods', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'WT1 Proteins/*genetics']",2005/09/01 09:00,2008/09/06 09:00,['2005/09/01 09:00'],"['2005/09/01 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/09/06 09:00 [medline]', '2005/09/01 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Zhongguo Shi Yan Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi. 2005 Aug;13(4):610-4.,,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (WT1 Proteins)']",,['1009-2137(2005)04-0610-05 [pii]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The reuslts indicated that after IL-2 and PHA were supplemented in the cultivated systems mixing with NK cells and K562 cells as the E/T ratio was 10/1, the ROM production increased from 33.17 +/- 25.02 U/ml to 223.59 +/- 59.41 U/ml (P < 0.05) while K562 cell inhibition rate (KIR) increased from 65.56% to 85.89% (P < 0.05). When the monocytes as the E/MO ratios of 10/2, 10/5 and 10/10 were supplemented respectively, ROM production increased correspondingly (ROM production was 389.79 +/- 43.83 U/ml, 456.74 +/- 42.77 U/ml, 601.42 +/- 21.92 U/ml, respectively), and KIR was on the other round (KIR was 82.36%, 81.36%, 48.09% respectively). Tiopronin, DHT were used in the K562 + NK + MO + IL-2/PHA cultivated systems as the E/MO ratio was 10/2, the ROM production also decreased from 389.79 +/- 43.83 U/ml to -1.20 +/- 60.70 U/ml, 50.21 +/- 22.4 U/ml (P < 0.05), respectively, however KIR increased from 82.53% to 96.09% and 94.64% either (P < 0.05). Higher concentrations of tiopronin and DHT were used, ROM production decreased accordingly. There showed a reverse correlation between ROM production and KIR (r = -0.518). When E/MO ratio was 10/5 or 10/10, tiopronin at any testing concentration and DHT at the higher testing concentration could reduce the ROM production (P < 0.05), but did not improve KIR significantly (P > 0.05). Tiopronin was as good as DHT in ameliorating KIR (P > 0.05) and better than DHT in scavenging ROM (P < 0.05). It is concluded that (1) Monocytes are the major resources of ROM, and the ROM derived from monocytes can disable NK cells in killing neoplasm cells (K562 cells); (2) A new ROM scavenger, tiopronin, can scavenge ROM effectively, and reverse the ROM induced inhibition of NK cell-mediated killing of K562 cell in a certain extent. And tiopronin is better than DHT in scavenging ROM, and as good as DHT in up-regulating KIR. The new ROM scavenger tiopronin with less side effect may take the place of DHT as adjuvant during the adoptive immuno-therapy in leukemia.","['Guo, Jian-Xin', 'Pan, Jing-Xin', 'Zhu, Yuan-Gui', 'Luo, Yong-He', 'Guo, Xi-Ze', 'Cai, Jun-Feng', 'Li, Yong-Jia', 'Li, Qiu-Lan']","['Guo JX', 'Pan JX', 'Zhu YG', 'Luo YH', 'Guo XZ', 'Cai JF', 'Li YJ', 'Li QL']","['Department of Hematology, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Fujian Medical University, Quanzhou 362000, China.']",['chi'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",China,Zhongguo Shi Yan Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi,Zhongguo shi yan xue ye xue za zhi,101084424,IM,"['Coculture Techniques', 'Cytotoxicity Tests, Immunologic', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic/drug effects/immunology', 'Free Radical Scavengers/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Killer Cells, Natural/cytology/*drug effects/immunology', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Tiopronin/*pharmacology']",2005/09/01 09:00,2008/09/06 09:00,['2005/09/01 09:00'],"['2005/09/01 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/09/06 09:00 [medline]', '2005/09/01 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Zhongguo Shi Yan Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi. 2005 Aug;13(4):589-95.,,"['0 (Free Radical Scavengers)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', 'C5W04GO61S (Tiopronin)']",,['1009-2137(2005)04-0589-07 [pii]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the importance of VEGF during differentiation or apoptosis of leukemia cells remains to be elucidated. In order to assess the alternation of VEGF gene expression in the process of all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA)-induced differentiation of NB4 acute promyelocytic leukemia cell line, and a competitor DNA fragment, VEGF gene competative template (T-VEGFDelta) was constructed by using gene recombinant technologies, and a competitive quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (cQRT-PCR) method was developed. A standard curve was obtained by co-amplification of serial dilutions of the target nulecules with constant amount of competitive template and this curve was used to detect molecular number of target gene in measuring sample. The surface expression of CD11b antigen and nitroblue tetrazolium (NBT) reduction rate of NB4 cells were also assayed at different time points. The results showed that cQRT-PCR was a sensitive, reliable tool for analysis of VEGF gene expression with a detectable range from 1 x 10(4) to 2 x 10(5) molecules. The number of VEGF gene transcripts detected by means of cQRT-PCR assay was 42.3 x 10(5), 12.6 x 10(5), 3.6 x 10(5), and less than 1.0 x 10(5)/microg total RNA at 0, 12, 24 and 48 hours after ATRA treatment, respectively. This rapid down-regulation of VEGF gene expression, during ATRA-induced NB4 cell differentiation, was accompanied by the up-regulation of CD11b expression and an increased NBT reduction rate. In conclusion, cQRT-PCR method was successtully constructed, confirming that ATRA efficiently repressed VEGF, at the same time, the ATRA might exert an antileukemic effect, other than induction of differentiation via inhibition of angiogenesis.","['Bai, Xia', 'Fu, Jian-Xin', 'Ding, Kai-Yang', 'Cen, Jian-Nong', 'Wang, Wei', 'Ruan, Chang-Geng']","['Bai X', 'Fu JX', 'Ding KY', 'Cen JN', 'Wang W', 'Ruan CG']","['Jiangsu Institute of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Suzhou University, Suzhou 215006, China.']",['chi'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",China,Zhongguo Shi Yan Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi,Zhongguo shi yan xue ye xue za zhi,101084424,IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'CD11b Antigen/genetics', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects/genetics', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/genetics/pathology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction/methods', 'Tretinoin/*pharmacology', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A/*genetics']",2005/09/01 09:00,2008/09/06 09:00,['2005/09/01 09:00'],"['2005/09/01 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/09/06 09:00 [medline]', '2005/09/01 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Zhongguo Shi Yan Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi. 2005 Aug;13(4):548-52.,,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (CD11b Antigen)', '0 (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)']",,['1009-2137(2005)04-0548-05 [pii]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we report on a gene expression cassette that can be potentially exploited in integrating vector systems to eliminate post-therapeutic tumorigenesis. The Herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase (hsvTK) gene under the transcriptional control of the human telomere reverse transcriptase promoter (hTERTp) was incorporated into a self-inactivating HIV-based lentiviral vector. The hTERT promoter is silent in normal somatic cells and re-activated in tumor cells. Therefore, normal gene-corrected cells should not express hsvTK from the promoter. However, if some gene-corrected cells subsequently become tumorigenic and the hTERT promoter is re-activated, application of ganciclovir (GCV), a clinically used antiviral drug, will achieve selective deletion of the cancerous cells. Our experimental data indicated that the hTERTp-hsvTK cassette in the lentiviral vector was sufficient to differentiate between tumor cells and normal cells, thus eradicating tumor cells selectively in vitro and in vivo. These results proved the principle of using the element in integrating vectors for safer gene delivery.","['Painter, Richard G', 'Lanson, Nicholas A Jr', 'Jin, Zhengmin', 'Park, Frank', 'Wang, Guoshun']","['Painter RG', 'Lanson NA Jr', 'Jin Z', 'Park F', 'Wang G']","['Gene Therapy Program, Department of Medicine, Louisiana State University, Health Sciences Center, New Orleans, Louisiana 70112, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Cancer Sci,Cancer science,101168776,IM,"['Animals', 'Antiviral Agents/pharmacology', 'Carcinoma, Squamous Cell/pathology', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/*genetics', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics', 'Fibroblasts', 'Fibrosarcoma/pathology', 'Ganciclovir/pharmacology', 'Gene Silencing', '*Gene Transfer Techniques', '*Genes, Transgenic, Suicide', 'Genetic Therapy/*methods', 'Genetic Vectors', 'Head and Neck Neoplasms/pathology', 'Humans', 'Lentivirus/genetics', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/pathology', 'Mice', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Risk Factors', 'Safety', 'Simplexvirus/enzymology', 'Telomerase/*genetics', 'Thymidine Kinase/*biosynthesis', 'Transduction, Genetic', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2005/09/01 09:00,2005/10/28 09:00,['2005/09/01 09:00'],"['2005/09/01 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/10/28 09:00 [medline]', '2005/09/01 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Sci. 2005 Sep;96(9):607-13. doi: 10.1111/j.1349-7006.2005.00085.x.,,"['0 (Antiviral Agents)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.1.21 (Thymidine Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (Telomerase)', 'P9G3CKZ4P5 (Ganciclovir)']",,"['CAS085 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1349-7006.2005.00085.x [doi]']",,['(Cancer Sci 2005; 96: 607 -613).'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A tumor suppressor gene, TSLC1/IGSF4, from chromosomal region 11q23 was identified in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) by its tumor suppressor activity in nude mice. TSLC1/IGSF4 is expressed in most tissues except for peripheral blood lymphocytes, but it is inactivated in 44% of NSCLC and 30-60% of various cancers, including liver, pancreatic, and prostate cancers, especially in those with invasion or metastasis. Inactivation occurs by two hits: through promoter methylation, and through loss of heterozygosity at the gene locus. TSLC1/IGSF4 encodes an immunoglobulin superfamily cell adhesion molecule and associates with an actin-binding protein, DAL-1/4.1B, and members of the membrane-associated guanylate kinase homologue (MAGuK) group, providing a novel tumor suppressor cascade that is inactivated in more than 80% of NSCLC. TSLC1/IGSF4 appears to be involved in the formation of an epithelial cell structure with DAL-1/4.1B and MAGuK. Furthermore, TSLC1/IGSF4 may act as a tumor antigen recognized by activated NK or CD8+ T cells. These two distinct mechanisms based on homophilic and heterophilic interactions would be responsible for tumor suppression by TSLC1/IGSF4. TSLC1/IGSF4 is ectopically expressed in adult T-cell leukemia (ATL) cells, providing not only a diagnostic marker for ATL, but also a possible therapeutic target against its invasion. The distinct roles of TSLC1/IGSF4 in the oncogenesis of carcinomas and ATL could be due to tissue-specific differences in the downstream cascades, and is a novel concept with respect to cell adhesion in human oncogenesis.","['Murakami, Yoshinori']",['Murakami Y'],"['Tumor Suppression and Functional Genomics Project, National Cancer Center Research Institute, 5-1-1, Tsukiji, Tokyo 104-0045, Japan. ymurakam@gan2.ncc.go.jp']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",England,Cancer Sci,Cancer science,101168776,IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, Neoplasm', '*Cell Adhesion', 'Cell Adhesion Molecule-1', 'Cell Adhesion Molecules', '*Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'DNA Methylation', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulins/*genetics/*physiology', 'Loss of Heterozygosity', 'Membrane Proteins/*genetics/*physiology', 'Neoplasms/*genetics/*physiopathology', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Rats', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins']",2005/09/01 09:00,2005/10/28 09:00,['2005/09/01 09:00'],"['2005/09/01 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/10/28 09:00 [medline]', '2005/09/01 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Sci. 2005 Sep;96(9):543-52. doi: 10.1111/j.1349-7006.2005.00089.x.,,"['0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (CADM1 protein, human)', '0 (Cell Adhesion Molecule-1)', '0 (Cell Adhesion Molecules)', '0 (Immunoglobulins)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)']",55,"['CAS089 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1349-7006.2005.00089.x [doi]']",,['(Cancer Sci 2005; 96: 543 -552).'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: A workshop to discuss the ""State of the Art and Future Needs in Cytogenetic/Molecular Genetics/Arrays"" in pediatric NHL was held in conjunction with the First International Symposium on Childhood and Adolescent Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma on April 9, 2003 in New York City. RESULTS: Cytogenetic characteristics of pediatric NHL include 14q11.2 rearrangements in T-cell lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphomas (LBL), ALK rearrangements in anaplastic large cell lymphomas (ALCL), and CMYC translocations in both Burkitt and Burkitt-like lymphomas (BL/BLL). Pediatric diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is cytogenetically different from DLBCL in adults, suggesting a different disease in children. Microarray studies demonstrate three types of T-cell leukemia, the leukemic counterpart of LBL, that block T-cell differentiation at different stages of T-cell development, corresponding to LYL, TAL1, and HOX-expressing leukemias. ALCL cell lines have a unique expression profile compared to normal T-cells. Germinal centers of BL have CMYC expression signatures, indicating that CMYC expression is ectopic and does not reflect the physiology of the normal cell counterpart. CONCLUSIONS: Additional cytogenetic, molecular and microarray investigations of NHL in children are vital to better understand these diseases, their etiology, and differences from adult NHL. A greater understanding of pediatric NHL will lead to disease-specific and patient-individualized therapies of these diseases.","['Heerema, Nyla A', 'Bernheim, Alain', 'Lim, Megan S', 'Look, A Thomas', 'Pasqualucci, Laura', 'Raetz, Elizabeth', 'Sanger, Warren G', 'Cairo, Mitchell S']","['Heerema NA', 'Bernheim A', 'Lim MS', 'Look AT', 'Pasqualucci L', 'Raetz E', 'Sanger WG', 'Cairo MS']","['Department of Pathology, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH 43210, USA. heerema-1@medctr.osu.edu']",['eng'],"['Congress', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/genetics', 'Child', 'Cytogenetic Analysis', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics', 'Gene Rearrangement', 'Homeodomain Proteins/genetics', 'Humans', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/genetics', 'Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse/genetics', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/*genetics', 'Microarray Analysis', 'Molecular Biology', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics', 'Oncogene Proteins/genetics', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/genetics']",2005/08/30 09:00,2005/11/09 09:00,['2005/08/30 09:00'],"['2005/08/30 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/11/09 09:00 [medline]', '2005/08/30 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2005 Oct 15;45(5):616-22. doi: 10.1002/pbc.20552.,['R13-CA10195-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['0 (Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (LYL1 protein, human)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (STIL protein, human)', '0 (TLX3 protein, human)']",,['10.1002/pbc.20552 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Cells were dosed for 4 hr and harvested immediately at the end of the treatment or after a 20-hr recovery period. Cytotoxicity and genotoxicity were evaluated by standard assays. Statistical analysis of these data revealed that, while gene expression responses to HU treatment were markedly different at 4 hr vs. 24 hr, there was otherwise a consistent pattern of dose-response across the three studies. Therefore, the studies were merged and each time point was evaluated separately. At 4 hr, we identified 173 (P < 0.0001) dose-responsive genes with a common trend in all three studies. These were mainly associated with the cell cycle, DNA repair and DNA metabolism, and in particular, the intra-S and G2/M phase checkpoints. At 24 hr, we identified 434 dose-responsive genes common across studies. These genes were involved in lymphocyte-specific activities and the activation of apoptosis via the caspase cascade.

For this reason, children who have received anthracyclines need periodical cardiac evaluation. The plasma levels of B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) have been shown to increase in proportion to severity of cardiac dysfunction. N-terminal BNP (NT-pro-BNP) is secreted from the cardiac ventricles in response to volume expansion and pressure overload. The aim of our study was to investigate whether plasma levels of NT-pro-BNP and cardiac troponin I (cTnI) can be used as specific markers for doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity in children with malignancy. METHODS: We performed the study in Dicle University Hospital, Pediatric Hematology and Oncology clinic. Were measured plasma NT-pro-BNP and cTnI in 31 patients (14 boys and 17 girls) who received doxorubicin-containing chemotherapy for their malignancy at cumulative doses of 30-600 mg/m2, between October 2000 and December 2004. Cardiac evaluation of the patients included recording of electrocardiography and assessment of systolic and diastolic functions of the heart by echocardiography. RESULTS: Of the 31 patients, 4 (12.9%) had left ventricular dysfunction as assessed by echocardiography. Plasma NT-pro-BNP levels in these patients were significantly elevated in comparison with healthy controls (p<0.001). Plasma NT-pro-BNP levels were significantly elevated in patients with cardiac dysfunction when compared with normal cardiac function (p<0.008). The cTnI levels were found under normal value in all patients. CONCLUSION: Measurement of NT-pro-BNP level may be an easy and practical tool, and during treatment may allow earlier-identification of individuals at risk for monitoring cardiac damage. Plasma NT-pro-BNP concentration may be a useful and sensitive indicator of cardiac dysfunction in children receiving doxorubicin therapy.","['Soker, Murat', 'Kervancioglu, Mehmet']","['Soker M', 'Kervancioglu M']","['Department of Pediatrics, Unit of Hematology and Oncology, University of Dicle, Diyarbakir 21280, Turkey. msoker@dicle.edu.tr']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Saudi Arabia,Saudi Med J,Saudi medical journal,7909441,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/*adverse effects', 'Cardiomyopathies/*blood/*chemically induced/diagnostic imaging', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Doxorubicin/*adverse effects', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/drug therapy', 'Lymphoma/drug therapy', 'Male', 'Natriuretic Peptide, Brain/*blood', 'Peptide Fragments/*blood', 'Troponin I/*blood', 'Ultrasonography']",2005/08/30 09:00,2007/10/16 09:00,['2005/08/30 09:00'],"['2005/08/30 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/10/16 09:00 [medline]', '2005/08/30 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Saudi Med J. 2005 Aug;26(8):1197-202.,,"['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Peptide Fragments)', '0 (Troponin I)', '0 (pro-brain natriuretic peptide (1-76))', '114471-18-0 (Natriuretic Peptide, Brain)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)']",,"[""20050218' [pii]""]",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Is there any role in disease process?,1190-6,"OBJECTIVE: Within soft-tissue sarcoma, primitive neuroectodermal tumors have been shown to cover a wide spectrum of small round cell sarcomas, including Ewing's sarcomas (ES) and primitive neuroectodermal tumors (PNET). The role of the stem cell factor/kit pathway has been investigated in different human tumors especially in chronic myelocytic leukemia and gastrointestinal stromal tumor and an autocrine loop has been assumed in small cell lung carcinoma, and recently in ES and PNET. Our aim is to investigate the c-kit expression in ES and PNET and also to assessed if c-kit has any role in disease process. METHODS: We thoroughly searched the archives of the Department of Pathology, Faculty of Medicine, Cukurova University Turkey, between 2000 and 2004; and found 14 ES and 14 PNET paraffin embedded tissues. We carried out the detection of the c-kit expression by immunohistochemical staining. RESULTS: The patient's median age was 23.7 +/-14.6 (12 male and 16 female). Five were diagnosed as metastatic disease whereas 23 were diagnosed as non-metastatic disease at admission. The mean follow up period was 38.9 +/- 22.3 months. The main localization of the disease was lower extremity (32.1%), and others were as follows: head and neck 25%, thorax and abdomen 14.3%, pelvic and upper extremity 7.1% (11 were localized skeletal and 17 were extraskeletal). According to treatment modalities, 10 were treated with surgery alone, 11 with surgery and chemotherapy, and 7 with surgery, radiation therapy and also with chemotherapy. The primary tumor was lower than 5 cm in its dimension in 21 patients. While in 5 patients, tumor was more than 5 cm but did not exceed 10 cm, it was >10 cm in 2 patients. The c-kit expression was positive in 7 patients both cytoplasmic and membranously, whereas 8 patients were positive cytoplasmically. In 5 PNET patients, c-kit expression were stained immunohistochemically in over 50% and in 3 of ES patients. There was no significant correlation between c-kit expression and gender, localization, metastatic status, treatment modalities and tumor. Although in survival analysis, patients treated with surgery alone lived longer, while >50% of patients treated with c-kit expression lived for a shorter period. CONCLUSION: We suggest that therapy with tyrosine kinase inhibitor for PNET and ES patients may be an alternative in addition to standard therapy modalities, especially in patients non-responsive to standard therapy.","['Kara, Ismail O', 'Gonlusen, Gulfiliz', 'Sahin, Berksoy', 'Ergin, Melek', 'Erdogan, Seyda']","['Kara IO', 'Gonlusen G', 'Sahin B', 'Ergin M', 'Erdogan S']","['Department of Medical Oncology, Faculty of Medicine, Cukurova University, 01330, Adana, Turkey. iokara@cu.edu.tr']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Saudi Arabia,Saudi Med J,Saudi medical journal,7909441,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Child', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Neuroectodermal Tumors, Primitive/*metabolism/*pathology/therapy', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit/*metabolism', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Sarcoma, Ewing/*metabolism/*pathology/therapy']",2005/08/30 09:00,2007/10/16 09:00,['2005/08/30 09:00'],"['2005/08/30 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/10/16 09:00 [medline]', '2005/08/30 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Saudi Med J. 2005 Aug;26(8):1190-6.,,"['EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit)']",,"[""20040840' [pii]""]",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The appearance of uterodomes (pinopods) in this regard was first introduced in rodents with an established pinocytotic function, whereas little evidence was available in humans in this context. This study was undertaken to identify the potential physiological roles of uterodomes in the implantation process. To address this, endometrial biopsies from early, mid- and late luteal phases of the menstrual cycle of 23 fertile female patients with regular menses were used. Scanning and transmission electron microscopies (SEM and TEM) as well as immunofluorescence and immunogold TEM were performed to study the morphological changes and the expression pattern of leukaemia inhibitory factor (LIF) at uterodomes. Our results illustrated a high level of LIF expression in the human uterodomes, which was colocalized with the well-known biochemical markers of exocytosis, including syntaxin-1, 25-kDa synaptosomal protein (SNAP-25) and vesicle-associated membrane protein-2 (VAMP-2). Our morphological and immunocytochemical findings illustrated a secretory function for human uterodomes for the first time. In conclusion, this novel function for uterodomes provides an important clue in detection of their physiological function(s) during the process of the plasma membrane transformation.","['Kabir-Salmani, M', 'Nikzad, H', 'Shiokawa, S', 'Akimoto, Y', 'Iwashita, M']","['Kabir-Salmani M', 'Nikzad H', 'Shiokawa S', 'Akimoto Y', 'Iwashita M']","['Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Kyorin University School of Medicine, Mitaka, Tokyo, Japan. kabirs_m@yahoo.com']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Mol Hum Reprod,Molecular human reproduction,9513710,IM,"['Adult', 'Biomarkers', 'Embryo Implantation/*physiology', 'Endometrium/cytology/*metabolism/ultrastructure', 'Exocytosis/physiology', 'Female', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Interleukin-6/*metabolism', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Microscopy, Electron, Scanning', 'Microscopy, Electron, Transmission']",2005/08/30 09:00,2005/12/13 09:00,['2005/08/30 09:00'],"['2005/08/30 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/12/13 09:00 [medline]', '2005/08/30 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Mol Hum Reprod. 2005 Aug;11(8):553-9. doi: 10.1093/molehr/gah218.

The normal physiology and pathologic modifications of the three cellular elements in blood, i.e., leukocytes, erythrocytes and platelets, have been thoroughly investigated by this recently emerged optical tool. By revealing subtle alterations in the structures of macromolecules in these blood cells, IR spectroscopy has become an ideal complementary analytical tool to conventional biochemical assays used to diagnose various common hematological disorders. Such traditional assays include molecular structure measurements that determine erythrocyte membrane fluidity and conformational changes, lipid profiling of platelet membranes, as well as assays of leukocyte proliferation and differentiation. IR spectroscopic-based techniques can be used to analyze DNA alterations, secondary structural changes in proteins, and to profile cellular lipids. From a molecular and biomedical perspective, IR spectroscopy has been explored for the diagnosis and prognosis of leukemia and beta-thalassemia, to predict drug sensitivity and resistance in chemotherapy patients, and more recently to examine apoptotic processes in blood cells. These studies have shown great promise in the early identification of drug-resistant patients and the early diagnosis of hematological disorders, especially malignancies. Furthermore, IR spectroscopic-based investigations will enable specific mechanisms underlying hematological disorders to be elucidated by revealing the molecular changes in the blood cells at a very early pathogenesis stage.","['Liu, Kan-Zhi', 'Shi, Min-Hua', 'Mantsch, Henry H']","['Liu KZ', 'Shi MH', 'Mantsch HH']","['Institute for Biodiagnostics, National Research Council of Canada, 435 Ellice Avenue, Winnipeg, MB, Canada R3B 1Y6. kan-zhi.liu@nrc-cnrc.gc.ca']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Blood Cells Mol Dis,"Blood cells, molecules & diseases",9509932,IM,"['Apoptosis/physiology', 'Blood Cells/*chemistry', 'Blood Platelets/chemistry/physiology', 'Cell Differentiation/physiology', 'Erythrocytes/chemistry/physiology', 'Hematology/*instrumentation', 'Humans', 'Leukocytes/chemistry/physiology', 'Spectrophotometry, Infrared/instrumentation/*methods/trends']",2005/08/30 09:00,2006/04/07 09:00,['2005/08/30 09:00'],"['2005/06/07 00:00 [received]', '2005/06/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2005/08/30 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/04/07 09:00 [medline]', '2005/08/30 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood Cells Mol Dis. 2005 Nov-Dec;35(3):404-12. doi: 10.1016/j.bcmd.2005.06.009.

In this study, we found that apoptosis but not cell growth arrest was induced by TB (1 microM, for 24 h) in human promyelocytic leukemia (HL60) cells. The apoptotic effect induced by TB in the HL60 cell was not through the general differentiation mechanisms evidenced by evaluation of three recognized markers, including CD11b, CD33, and morphological features. In addition, our results also revealed that TB-induced apoptosis was not through the cellular surface CD 95 receptor-mediated signaling pathway. We found that the mitochondria membrane in the TB-treated HL60 cells was dissipated by decreasing of the electrochemical gradient (DeltaPsi(m)) led to leakage of cytochrome c from mitochondria into cytosol. Such effects were completely blocked by in vitro transfection of the HL60 cells with Bcl-2 overexpression plasmid (HL60/Bcl-2). However, our data found that TB-mediated apoptosis could not be completely prevented in the Bcl-2 over expressed (HL60/Bcl-2) cells. Such results implied that additional mediators (such as caspase-9) other than mitochondria membrane permeability might contribute to the TB-induced cellular apoptosis signaling. This hypothesis was supported by the evidence that administration of caspases-9 specific inhibitor (z-LEHD-fmk) blocked the TB-induced apoptosis.

They invade decidual tissue, but, unlike tumor cells, shut down their invasive properties, when they become inappropriate. Stimuli involved in the modulation of invasion, as well as their underlying signaling mechanisms require further clarification. We were especially interested in discovering signals capable of stimulating invasion in otherwise low-invasive cells involved in reproduction. Using the choriocarcinoma cell line Jeg-3 as a model, we have addressed the potential role of cytokine/growth factor-driven activation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) in this process. Jeg-3 cells were treated with various factors known to induce trophoblast proliferation, differentiation, migration, or invasiveness (insulin-like-growth-factor-II (IGF-II), hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF)). Only LIF elicited strong tyrosine phosphorylation and specific DNA-binding activity of STAT3. It induced a significant acceleration of cell proliferation and promoted the capability of Jeg-3 cells to invade into an artificial extracellular matrix. Moreover, LIF influenced the expression pattern of proteases and protease inhibitors with potential relevance for invasiveness (downregulation of mRNA for tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 1 (TIMP-1) and upregulation of mRNA for caspase-4).

Patients were classified according to the French-American-British and World Health Organization classifications, as well as the International Prognostic Scoring System and the M.D. Anderson prognostic score. Comorbidity scores were assessed by using an HCT-specific comorbidity index. Patients were aged 1 to 66 years (median, 48 years). Twenty-one patients received transplants from related donors (18 HLA-identical siblings and 3 HLA-nonidentical family members), and 22 received transplants from unrelated donors (18 HLA matched and 4 HLA nonidentical). Several busulfan or total body irradiation-based conditioning regimens were used. Sustained engraftment was achieved in 41 patients. Eighteen are alive at 1.9 to 14.1 years, for an estimated relapse-free survival of 41% at 4 years. Ten patients have relapsed, thus leading to a cumulative incidence of 23% at 4 years. Risk category by International Prognostic Scoring System, World Health Organization, M.D. Anderson prognostic score, or proliferative/dysplastic status had no statistically significant association with outcomes. However, patients with higher comorbidity scores had worse overall survival than patients with lower scores (P = .01). There was a trend for a higher relapse incidence among patients at higher risk by the M.D. Anderson prognostic score. The data suggest that patients with few or no comorbidities and those who undergo transplantation earlier in the disease course have the highest probability of successful outcome after allogeneic HCT.","['Kerbauy, Daniella M B', 'Chyou, Faith', 'Gooley, Ted', 'Sorror, Mohamed L', 'Scott, Bart', 'Pagel, John M', 'Myerson, David', 'Appelbaum, Frederick R', 'Storb, Rainer', 'Deeg, H Joachim']","['Kerbauy DM', 'Chyou F', 'Gooley T', 'Sorror ML', 'Scott B', 'Pagel JM', 'Myerson D', 'Appelbaum FR', 'Storb R', 'Deeg HJ']","['Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA 98109, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Biol Blood Marrow Transplant,Biology of blood and marrow transplantation : journal of the American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation,9600628,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Comorbidity', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Histocompatibility Testing', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Chronic/mortality/*therapy', '*Living Donors', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Recurrence', 'Retrospective Studies', '*Transplantation Conditioning/methods/mortality', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Treatment Outcome']",2005/08/30 09:00,2005/11/16 09:00,['2005/08/30 09:00'],"['2005/03/29 00:00 [received]', '2005/05/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2005/08/30 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/11/16 09:00 [medline]', '2005/08/30 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Biol Blood Marrow Transplant. 2005 Sep;11(9):713-20. doi: 10.1016/j.bbmt.2005.05.008.,"['CA18029/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL36444/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA78902/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA15704/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA87948/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA078902/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,"['S1083-8791(05)00320-4 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bbmt.2005.05.008 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Etanercept (25 mg subcutaneously) was administered twice weekly for 16 doses, along with methylprednisolone (2 mg/kg) and tacrolimus for biopsy-proven aGVHD. Twenty patients with a median age of 47 years (range, 8-63 years) were enrolled. Fourteen patients with grade II aGVHD (11 family donors and 3 unrelated donors) and 6 patients with grade III aGVHD (3 family donors and 3 unrelated donors) were treated. Twelve patients completed 16 doses of therapy, and 8 received 5 to 15 doses. Reasons for not completing all doses of etanercept included progression of aGVHD (n = 4), relapsed leukemia (n = 2), progression of pulmonary and central nervous system lesions (n = 1), and perforated duodenal ulcer (n = 1). Fifteen (75%) of 20 patients had complete resolution of aGVHD within 4 weeks of therapy. Increasing levels of soluble TNF receptor 1 plasma concentration during the first 4 weeks of therapy indicated progression of aGVHD in 5 patients.

A multi-centre, randomised trial was undertaken to determine the effects of ex-vivo T-cell depletion versus methotrexate and cyclosporine immunosuppression on 3-year disease-free survival. METHODS: Between Mar 1, 1995, and Oct 31, 2000, 405 patients with lymphohaemopoietic malignancy, from 15 participating centres, were randomly assigned to undergo transplantation with either T-cell depleted marrow and cyclosporine A (TCD arm; n=201) or methotrexate and cyclosporine A after transplantation of T-replete marrow (M/C arm; n=204). The primary outcome was 3-year disease-free survival and was analysed by intention to treat. FINDINGS: Five patients died before transplantation. Seven in the TCD arm received T-replete grafts. Disease-free survival at 3 years was 27% (95% CI 21-33) and 34% (27-40) in recipients of TCD and M/C, respectively (p=0.16). TCD was associated with significantly more rapid neutrophil recovery (15 days vs 20 days, p<0.0001), less grade III-IV acute GVHD (18%vs 37%, p<0.0001), reduced grade III-IV toxicities (19%vs 29%, p=0.017), reduced duration of initial hospitalisation, but higher risk of chronic myelogenous leukaemia relapse (20%vs 7%, p=0.009) and cytomegalovirus infection (28%vs 17%, p=0.023) than was M/C. INTERPRETATION: Disease-free survival at 3 years did not differ between TCD and M/C groups. Relapse and opportunistic infection are important obstacles to successful unrelated donor bone marrow transplantation, irrespective of the method of GVHD prophylaxis used.","['Wagner, John E', 'Thompson, John S', 'Carter, Shelly L', 'Kernan, Nancy A']","['Wagner JE', 'Thompson JS', 'Carter SL', 'Kernan NA']","['University of Minnesota Blood and Marrow Transplantation Program, Minneapolis, MN 55455, USA. wagne002@umn.edu']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Clinical Trial, Phase II', 'Clinical Trial, Phase III', 'Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Lancet,"Lancet (London, England)",2985213R,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation/adverse effects/immunology', 'Cyclosporine/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease/immunology/*prevention & control', 'Hematologic Diseases/mortality/*therapy', 'Humans', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Leukemia/mortality/*therapy', 'Lymphocyte Depletion', 'Male', 'Methotrexate/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Middle Aged', 'Recurrence', 'Survival Rate', 'T-Lymphocytes']",2005/08/30 09:00,2005/10/13 09:00,['2005/08/30 09:00'],"['2005/08/30 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/10/13 09:00 [medline]', '2005/08/30 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Lancet. 2005 Aug 27-Sep 2;366(9487):733-41. doi: 10.1016/S0140-6736(05)66996-6.,"['N01-HB-47094/HB/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'N01-HB-47095/HB/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'N01-HB-47097/HB/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'N01-HB-47098/HB/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']","['0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)', '83HN0GTJ6D (Cyclosporine)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",,"['S0140-6736(05)66996-6 [pii]', '10.1016/S0140-6736(05)66996-6 [doi]']",,,['Unrelated Donor Marrow Transplantation Trial'],,,,['Lancet. 2005 Aug 27-Sep 2;366(9487):692-4.

Promyelocytic leukaemia (PML) bodies are dynamic nuclear structures that concentrate PML protein, SUMO-1 and several sumoylated and non-sumoylated protein regulators of nuclear functions. PML bodies and their associated CBP has been involved in neuronal survival. By light and electron microscopy immunocytochemistry and in situ hybridization we reported the presence, in non-pathological conditions, of a large PML-nuclear inclusion (PML-NI) in human supraoptic neurons. This inclusion appears as a single nuclear structure composed of a capsule enriched in PML, SUMO-1 and CBP proteins and a central lattice of filaments immunoreactive for class III beta-tubulin, ubiquitinated proteins and proteasomes. Furthermore, the PML-NI concentrates the SUMO-conjugating enzyme E2 (UBC9). The PML-NI may be considered a nuclear factory involved in sumoylation and proteolysis via ubiquitin-proteasome system, two nuclear pathways engaged in the control of the nucleoplasmic concentration of active transcriptional regulators. Interestingly, the structural and molecular organization of the PML-NI is related to the Marinesco bodies, age-associated ubiquitinated intranuclear inclusions, and to the intranuclear rodlets enriched in class III beta-tubulin, which are nuclear structures markedly decreased in Alzheimer's disease.","['Villagra, Nuria T', 'Navascues, Joaquin', 'Casafont, Inigo', 'Val-Bernal, J Fernando', 'Lafarga, Miguel', 'Berciano, Maria T']","['Villagra NT', 'Navascues J', 'Casafont I', 'Val-Bernal JF', 'Lafarga M', 'Berciano MT']","['Department of Anatomic Pathology, Marques de Valdecilla University Hospital, University of Cantabria, Santander, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Neurobiol Dis,Neurobiology of disease,9500169,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Aged', 'CREB-Binding Protein/metabolism', 'Cell Compartmentation/physiology', 'Cell Nucleolus/metabolism/ultrastructure', 'Cell Nucleus/*metabolism/ultrastructure', 'Chromatin/metabolism', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Intranuclear Inclusion Bodies/*metabolism/ultrastructure', 'Male', 'Microscopy, Immunoelectron', 'Middle Aged', 'Neurons/metabolism/ultrastructure', 'Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex/*metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'SUMO-1 Protein/*metabolism', 'Supraoptic Nucleus/*cytology', 'Ubiquitin/*metabolism']",2005/08/30 09:00,2006/03/10 09:00,['2005/08/30 09:00'],"['2005/04/19 00:00 [received]', '2005/06/30 00:00 [revised]', '2005/07/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2005/08/30 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/03/10 09:00 [medline]', '2005/08/30 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Neurobiol Dis. 2006 Jan;21(1):181-93. doi: 10.1016/j.nbd.2005.07.003.

A case was considered positive if > or = 50% of cells showed a positive reaction. RESULTS: Of the 78 NHL cases, 33 stained for CD20. Thirty were successfully stained; of these, 26 were positive. Twenty-nine cases stained for CD3. Twenty-five were successfully stained; of these, 3, consisting of 2 lymphoblastic lymphomas and 1 large cell lymphoma, showed a positive reaction. CD20 staining performed on 1 of these lymphoblastic lymphomas and the large cell lymphoma showed a diffuse cytoplasmic reaction, respectively, in 2% and 0% only but positive staining of the nucleoli in 96% and 84% of cells, respectively. Another lymphoblastic lymphoma case, which did not have an adequate number of CD3-positive cells to label it as of T-cell lineage also showed CD20 positive nucleoli in 60% of cells and a diffuse cytoplasmic reaction for CD 20 in 5% of cells. CONCLUSION: If our observation is corroborated by other studies, CD20 nucleolar positivity may serve as a diagnostic aid in T-cell neoplasms.","['Das, Dilip K']",['Das DK'],"['Department of Pathology, Faculty of Medicine, Kuwait University, Safat, Kuwait. dilip76@hotmail.com']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",Switzerland,Acta Cytol,Acta cytologica,0370307,IM,"['Adult', 'Antigens, CD20/*metabolism', 'Biopsy, Fine-Needle', 'CD3 Complex/metabolism', 'Cell Lineage', 'Cell Nucleolus/metabolism/pathology', 'Child', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Female', 'Hodgkin Disease/diagnosis/metabolism/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse/diagnosis/metabolism/pathology', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/diagnosis/metabolism/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/diagnosis/metabolism/pathology', 'T-Lymphocytes/metabolism/*pathology']",2005/08/30 09:00,2005/10/07 09:00,['2005/08/30 09:00'],"['2005/08/30 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/10/07 09:00 [medline]', '2005/08/30 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Acta Cytol. 2005 Jul-Aug;49(4):365-72. doi: 10.1159/000326167.,,"['0 (Antigens, CD20)', '0 (CD3 Complex)']",,['10.1159/000326167 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The degree of this association may vary according to the ethnic background and geographic localization of the population under study, or the phase of treatment when response to chemotherapy is concerned. PROCEDURE: We have analyzed the MTHFR C677T polymorphism in 52 patients and 88 control individuals, all ethnic Greek residents of northern Greece, and examined the association of this polymorphism with (a) susceptibility to childhood ALL and (b) the distribution of average plasma alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels, white blood cell counts (WBC), and hemoglobin levels (Hb) during the induction and consolidation phases of treatment. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: We were able to detect a statistically significant protective effect, with respect to ALL, associated with carriage of the MTHFR 677T allele [OR = 0.387 (95% CI = 0.193-0.776)]. In addition, we observed a general tendency towards lower values in all three parameters studied, associated with the MTHFR 677CC genotype, which was more evident in the transition from the induction to the consolidation phase, indicating that MTHFR genotyping may be of prognostic value in the early phase of treatment for childhood ALL, in our population.","['Chatzidakis, Konstantinos', 'Goulas, Antonis', 'Athanassiadou-Piperopoulou, Fani', 'Fidani, Liana', 'Koliouskas, Dimitrios', 'Mirtsou, Vassiliki']","['Chatzidakis K', 'Goulas A', 'Athanassiadou-Piperopoulou F', 'Fidani L', 'Koliouskas D', 'Mirtsou V']","['Department of Experimental Pharmacology, Medical School, Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, GR-54124, Thessaloniki, Greece.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Alanine Transaminase/blood/drug effects', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Gene Frequency', 'Genotype', 'Greece/epidemiology', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Methylenetetrahydrofolate Reductase (NADPH2)/*genetics', '*Polymorphism, Genetic', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/ethnology/*genetics', 'Retrospective Studies']",2005/08/27 09:00,2006/08/17 09:00,['2005/08/27 09:00'],"['2005/08/27 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/08/17 09:00 [medline]', '2005/08/27 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2006 Aug;47(2):147-51. doi: 10.1002/pbc.20574.,,"['EC 1.5.1.20 (Methylenetetrahydrofolate Reductase (NADPH2))', 'EC 2.6.1.2 (Alanine Transaminase)']",,['10.1002/pbc.20574 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The three mammalian isoforms (TGF-beta1, 2 and 3) have distinct but overlapping effects on hematopoiesis. Depending on the differentiation stage of the target cell, the local environment and the concentration and isoform of TGF-beta, in vivo or in vitro, TGF-beta can be pro- or antiproliferative, pro- or antiapoptotic, pro- or antidifferentiative and can inhibit or increase terminally differentiated cell function. TGF-beta is a major regulator of stem cell quiescence, at least in vitro. TGF-beta can act directly or indirectly through effects on the bone marrow microenvironment. In addition, paracrine and autocrine actions of TGF-beta have overlapping but distinct regulatory effects on hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells. Since TGF-beta can act in numerous steps in the hematopoietic cascade, loss of function mutations in hematopoeitic stem cells (HSC) have different effects on hematopoiesis than transient blockade of autocrine TGF-beta1. Transient neutralization of autocrine TGF-beta in HSC has therapeutic potential. In myeloid and erythroid leukemic cells, autocrine TGF-beta1 and/or its Smad signals controls the ability of these cells to respond to various differentiation inducers, suggesting that this pathway plays a role in determining the cell fate of leukemic cells.","['Ruscetti, Francis W', 'Akel, Salem', 'Bartelmez, Stephen H']","['Ruscetti FW', 'Akel S', 'Bartelmez SH']","['Laboratory of Experimental Immunology, Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute-Frederick, Frederick, MD 21702-1201, USA.

Therefore, stem cells represent an excellent model system in which to define the molecular mechanisms underlying cancer development and progression. Several signal transduction pathways including leukemia inhibitory factor, Wnt and FGF have been demonstrated to function in stem cell self-renewal and differentiation. However, more recently bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) have emerged as key regulators of stem cell fate commitment. Intriguingly, BMPs have disparate roles in regulating the biology of embryonic stem (ES) cells compared with neural crest stem cells (NCSCs). Furthermore, although BMPs block neural differentiation of ES cells from both mouse and human, they contribute to self-renewal specifically in mouse ES cells. These observations strongly suggest that combinations of extracellular factors regulate stem cells, and that crosstalk between intracellular signaling pathways precisely defines stem cell fate commitment. In this review, we focus on the role of BMP signaling in mouse and human ES cells compared with NCSCs. We then discuss how the molecular effectors of BMP signaling may contribute to cancer, and thus represent potential targets for therapeutic intervention.","['Varga, Alison C', 'Wrana, Jeffrey L']","['Varga AC', 'Wrana JL']","['Department of Molecular and Medical Genetics, University of Toronto, Toronto, M5S 1A8, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,IM,"['Animals', 'Bone Morphogenetic Proteins/*physiology', 'Embryo, Mammalian/cytology', 'Humans', 'Neoplasms/etiology/therapy', 'Signal Transduction', 'Stem Cells/*physiology']",2005/08/27 09:00,2005/09/16 09:00,['2005/08/27 09:00'],"['2005/08/27 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/09/16 09:00 [medline]', '2005/08/27 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2005 Aug 29;24(37):5713-21. doi: 10.1038/sj.onc.1208919.,,['0 (Bone Morphogenetic Proteins)'],56,"['1208919 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.onc.1208919 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

TGF-beta signaling is not required for normal thymopoiesis, but is essential for regulating the expansion, activation, and effector function of the mature CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in the peripheral lymphoid organs and target tissues. Recent studies in both mice and humans have elucidated an important and complex role for TGF-beta in regulatory T-cell biology. Disruption of TGF-beta signaling in T cells impairs the maintenance of regulatory T cells, results in the expansion of activated effector T cells, and is associated with the production of cytokines that have major effects on cells in their environment. While autoimmunity and inflammation are the principal phenotypes associated with the abrogation of TGF-beta signaling in T cells in mice, emerging evidence now also directly links Smad-dependent TGF-beta signaling in T cells to the suppression of epithelial neoplasia. The TGF-beta receptor-activated Smad3 plays a critical role in mediating many of the inhibitory effects of TGF-beta signaling in T cells, and has now been established as an important suppressor of leukemogenesis.

LIF binds to a receptor complex of LIFR-beta and gp130 and signals via the Janus kinase-signal transducer and activator of transcription (JAK-STAT) pathway, with signalling attenuated by suppressor of cytokine signalling (SOCS) proteins. Recent in vivo studies have highlighted the role of SOCS-3 in the negative regulation of signalling via gp130. To determine the role of SOCS-3 in ES cell biology, SOCS-3-null ES cell lines were generated. When cultured in LIF levels that sustain self-renewal of wild-type cells, SOCS-3-null ES cell lines exhibited less self-renewal and greater differentiation into primitive endoderm. The absence of SOCS-3 enhanced JAK-STAT and extracellular signal-related kinase 1/2 (ERK-1/2)-mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signal transduction via gp130, with higher levels of phosphorylated STAT-1, STAT-3, SH-2 domain-containing cytoplasmic protein tyrosine phosphatase 2 (SHP-2), and ERK-1/2 in steady state and in response to LIF stimulation. Attenuation of ERK signalling by the addition of MAPK/ERK kinase (MEK) inhibitors to SOCS-3-null ES cell cultures rescued the differentiation phenotype, but did not restore proliferation to wild-type levels. In summary, SOCS-3 plays a crucial role in the regulation of the LIF signalling pathway in murine ES cells. Its absence perturbs the balance between activation of the JAK-STAT and SHP-2-ERK-1/2-MAPK pathways, resulting in less self-renewal and a greater potential for differentiation into the primitive endoderm lineage.","['Forrai, Ariel', 'Boyle, Kristy', 'Hart, Adam H', 'Hartley, Lynne', 'Rakar, Steven', 'Willson, Tracy A', 'Simpson, Ken M', 'Roberts, Andrew W', 'Alexander, Warren S', 'Voss, Anne K', 'Robb, Lorraine']","['Forrai A', 'Boyle K', 'Hart AH', 'Hartley L', 'Rakar S', 'Willson TA', 'Simpson KM', 'Roberts AW', 'Alexander WS', 'Voss AK', 'Robb L']","['The Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, 1G Royal Parade, Parkville, Victoria 3050, Australia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Stem Cells,"Stem cells (Dayton, Ohio)",9304532,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects/*genetics', 'Cell Lineage/genetics', '*Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Embryo, Mammalian/cytology/*metabolism', 'Endoderm/cytology/metabolism', 'Interleukin-6/pharmacology', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'MAP Kinase Signaling System/drug effects/*genetics', 'Mice', 'Mice, Mutant Strains', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/metabolism', 'Stem Cells/cytology/*metabolism', 'Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling 3 Protein', 'Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling Proteins/*deficiency/genetics/metabolism']",2005/08/27 09:00,2006/06/09 09:00,['2005/08/27 09:00'],"['2005/08/27 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/06/09 09:00 [medline]', '2005/08/27 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Stem Cells. 2006 Mar;24(3):604-14. doi: 10.1634/stemcells.2005-0323.

HO-1 induction inhibits cytokine production in macrophages. Antioxidants induce HO-1 expression in various cell types. Alpha-lipoic acid (ALA), a thiol-containing dietary antioxidant, exhibits protective effects in vascular disease and induces anti-inflammatory effects in monocytes. This study examined the effects of ALA on HO-1 expression in human monocytic cells. METHODS AND RESULTS: ALA time and dose-dependently induced HO-1 mRNA expression in THP-1 cells, with peak expression at 4 hours and returning to baseline by 24 hours. This correlated with an increase in HO-1 protein expression. ALA stimulated translocation of the transcription factor nuclear factor-erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) into the nucleus and binding to a human HO-1 antioxidant response element (ARE) by 30 minutes. A dominant-negative Nrf2 inhibitor reduced ALA-induced HO-1 mRNA expression by 66%. Pretreatment with SB203580, a p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase inhibitor, reduced ALA-induced HO-1 mRNA expression by 75% and inhibited ALA-induced Nrf2 binding to the HO-1 ARE. CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrate that ALA induces HO-1 expression in THP-1 monocytic cells via Nrf2 and p38. Further studies are required to investigate whether the protective effects of ALA in monocytes are mediated by HO-1.","['Ogborne, Richard M', 'Rushworth, Stuart A', ""O'Connell, Maria A""]","['Ogborne RM', 'Rushworth SA', ""O'Connell MA""]","['MRC Human Nutrition Research, Elsie Widdowson Laboratory, Cambridge, CB1 9NL, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Arterioscler Thromb Vasc Biol,"Arteriosclerosis, thrombosis, and vascular biology",9505803,IM,"['Active Transport, Cell Nucleus/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Gene Expression/drug effects', 'Genes, Dominant', 'Heme Oxygenase-1/*genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia', 'Monocytes/cytology/drug effects/*physiology', 'NF-E2-Related Factor 2/genetics/*metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'Response Elements/physiology', 'Thioctic Acid/*pharmacology', 'p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/*metabolism']",2005/08/27 09:00,2006/01/13 09:00,['2005/08/27 09:00'],"['2005/08/27 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/01/13 09:00 [medline]', '2005/08/27 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Arterioscler Thromb Vasc Biol. 2005 Oct;25(10):2100-5. doi: 10.1161/01.ATV.0000183745.37161.6e.

The prognostic significance of angiogenic factors in adult acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) remains ambiguous. We therefore analyzed the impact of angiogenic factor levels on overall survival of newly diagnosed adult ALL patients. Plasma levels of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), interleukin-1 receptor alpha (IL-1Ralpha), IL-6, IL-8, VEGF receptors VEGFR1 and VEGFR2, and thrombopoietin (TPO) were measured in plasma samples of 95 patients by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). In a univariate Cox proportional hazards model, higher levels of IL-1Ralpha, IL-8, VEGFR1, and VEGFR2 were predictive of poor survival. In contrast, higher levels of VEGF were predictive of longer survival, and higher levels of bFGF suggested a similar trend (P = .09).

Hence, the existence of cyclin D1-negative MCL has been controversial and difficult to substantiate. Our previous gene expression profiling study identified several cases that lacked cyclin D1 expression, but had a gene expression signature typical of MCL. Herein, we report the clinical, pathologic, and genetic features of 6 cases of cyclin D1-negative MCL. All 6 cases exhibited the characteristic morphologic features and the unique gene expression signature of MCL but lacked the t(11;14)(q13; q32) by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis. The tumor cells also failed to express cyclin D1 protein, but instead expressed either cyclin D2 (2 cases) or cyclin D3 (4 cases). There was good correlation between cyclin D protein expression and the corresponding mRNA expression levels by gene expression analysis. Using interphase FISH, we did not detect chromosomal translocations or amplifications involving CCND2 and CCND3 loci in these cases. Patients with cyclin D1-negative MCL were similar clinically to those with cyclin D1-positive MCL. In conclusion, cases of cyclin D1-negative MCL do exist and are part of the spectrum of MCL.

The high degree of mismatching makes cell immunotherapy impossible as it would result in lethal graft-versus-host disease (GvHD). We generated large numbers of donor T-cell clones specific for Aspergillus or cytomegalovirus antigens. We identified clones potentially responsible for causing GvHD by screening them for cross-reactivity against recipient mononuclear cells. Non-recipient reactive, pathogen-specific clones were infused soon after transplantation. They were CD4+ and produced high levels of interferon-gamma and low levels of interleukin-10. In 46 control transplant recipients who did not receive adoptive therapy, spontaneous pathogen-specific T cells occurred in low frequency 9 to 12 months after transplantation and displayed a non-protective low interferon-gamma/high interleukin-10 production phenotype. In the 35 recipients who received adoptive therapy, one single infusion of donor alloantigen-deleted, pathogen-specific clones in the dose range of 10(5) to 10(6) cells/kg body weight did not cause GvHD and induced high-frequency T-cell responses to pathogens, which exhibited a protective high interferon-gamma/low interleukin-10 production phenotype within 3 weeks of infusion. Frequencies of pathogen-specific T cells remained stable over time, and were associated with control of Aspergillus and cytomegalovirus antigenemia and infectious mortality.

Histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACIs), such as trichostatin A (TSA) and suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA), have been characterized not only as anticancer drugs, but also as cytodifferentiation-inducing agents. In human endometrium, postovulatory production of progesterone directs estrogen-primed endometrial glandular cells to differentiate and thereby produce a number of unique bioactive substances, including glycodelin, that are critical for implantation at the secretory phase of the menstrual cycle. In this study, we show that TSA and SAHA, belonging to the hydroxamic acid group of HDACIs, can induce the phenotype of a human endometrial adenocarcinoma cell line, Ishikawa (originally derived from the glandular component of the endometrium), to differentiate to closely resemble normal endometrial epithelium in a time- and dose-dependent manner, as determined by morphological changes, synthesis of glycogen, and expression of secretory phase-specific proteins, including glycodelin. The proliferation- and differentiation-modulating effects elicited by TSA and SAHA at their optimal concentrations were comparable or more potent than those exerted by combined treatment with progesterone and estradiol. Furthermore, the gene silencing of glycodelin by small interference RNA resulted in the blockade of HDACI-induced differentiation in Ishikawa cells, suggesting the requirement for glycodelin for endometrial epithelial differentiation. Our results collectively indicate that TSA and SAHA are potent differentiation inducers for endometrial glandular cells, providing a clue for a possible therapeutic strategy to modulate endometrial function by targeting glycodelin.","['Uchida, Hiroshi', 'Maruyama, Tetsuo', 'Nagashima, Takashi', 'Asada, Hironori', 'Yoshimura, Yasunori']","['Uchida H', 'Maruyama T', 'Nagashima T', 'Asada H', 'Yoshimura Y']","['Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Keio University School of Medicine, Shinjuku, Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Endocrinology,Endocrinology,0375040,IM,"['Adenocarcinoma/*metabolism/*pathology', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Endometrial Neoplasms/*metabolism/*pathology', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Estradiol/administration & dosage/pharmacology', 'Female', 'Gene Silencing', 'Glycodelin', 'Glycogen/biosynthesis', 'Glycoproteins/genetics/*metabolism', '*Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors', 'Humans', 'Hydroxamic Acids/pharmacology', 'Interleukin-6/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Osmolar Concentration', 'Pregnancy Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Progesterone/administration & dosage/pharmacology', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/drug effects', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis', 'RNA, Small Interfering/pharmacology', 'Up-Regulation', 'Vorinostat']",2005/08/27 09:00,2006/01/06 09:00,['2005/08/27 09:00'],"['2005/08/27 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/01/06 09:00 [medline]', '2005/08/27 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Endocrinology. 2005 Dec;146(12):5365-73. doi: 10.1210/en.2005-0359.

The BH3-only members of this family act as sentinels, interconnecting specific death signals to the core apoptotic pathway. Our previous data demonstrated a role for BH3-only BID in maintaining myeloid homeostasis and suppressing leukemogenesis. In the absence of Bid, mice accumulate chromosomal aberrations and develop a fatal myeloproliferative disorder resembling chronic myelomonocytic leukemia. Here, we describe a role for BID in preserving genomic integrity that places BID at an early point in the path to determine the fate of a cell. We show that BID plays an unexpected role in the intra-S phase checkpoint downstream of DNA damage distinct from its proapoptotic function. We further demonstrate that this role is mediated through BID phosphorylation by the DNA-damage kinase ATM.

METHODS: We used data from the Gruppo Italiano di Farmacovigilanza nell'Anziano (GIFA) study, a large collaborative observational study based in community and university hospitals located throughout Italy. Our series consisted of three groups of patients with non-neoplastic chronic disease (congestive heart failure, CHF, N = 832; diabetes mellitus, N = 939; chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, COPD, N = 399), and three groups of patients with cancer (solid tumors without metastasis, N = 813; solid tumors with metastasis, N = 259; leukemia/lymphoma, N = 326). Functional capabilities were ascertained using the activities of daily living (ADL) scale, and categorical variables for dependency in at least 1 ADL or dependency in 3 or more ADLs were considered in the analysis. Cognitive status was evaluated by the 10-items Hodgkinson Abbreviated Mental Test (AMT). RESULTS: Cognitive impairment was more prevalent in patients with CHF (28.0%) or COPD (25.8%) than in those with cancer (solid tumors = 22.9%; leukemia/lymphoma = 19.6%; metastatic cancer = 22.8%). Dependency in at least 1 ADL was highly prevalent in patients with metastatic cancer (31.3% vs. 24% for patients with CHF and 22.4% for those with non-metastatic solid tumors, p < 0.001). In people aged 80 years or more, metastatic cancer was not associated with increased prevalence of physical disability. In multivariable analysis, metastatic cancer was associated with a greater prevalence of physical (OR 2.09, 95%CI 1.51-2.90) but not cognitive impairment (OR 1.34, 95%CI 0.94-1.91) with respect to CHF patients. Finally, diabetes was significantly associated with cognitive impairment (OR 1.40, 95%CI 1.11-1.78). CONCLUSION: Cancer should not be considered as an ineluctable cause of severe cognitive and physical impairment, at least not more than other chronic conditions highly prevalent in older people, such as CHF and diabetes mellitus.","['Corsonello, Andrea', 'Pedone, Claudio', 'Carosella, Luciana', 'Corica, Francesco', 'Mazzei, Bruno', 'Incalzi, Raffaele Antonelli']","['Corsonello A', 'Pedone C', 'Carosella L', 'Corica F', 'Mazzei B', 'Incalzi RA']","['Istituto Nazionale di Ricovero e Cura per Anziani, Cosenza, Italy. andrea_corsonello@tin.it']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,BMC Geriatr,BMC geriatrics,100968548,IM,"['*Activities of Daily Living', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Chronic Disease', 'Cognition Disorders/epidemiology/*etiology', 'Diabetes Complications/*complications', 'Female', '*Health Status', 'Heart Failure/*complications', '*Hospitalization', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/*complications', 'Pulmonary Disease, Chronic Obstructive/*complications']",2005/08/27 09:00,2006/06/15 09:00,['2005/08/27 09:00'],"['2004/12/28 00:00 [received]', '2005/08/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2005/08/27 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/06/15 09:00 [medline]', '2005/08/27 09:00 [entrez]']",epublish,BMC Geriatr. 2005 Aug 25;5:10. doi: 10.1186/1471-2318-5-10.,,,,"['1471-2318-5-10 [pii]', '10.1186/1471-2318-5-10 [doi]']",,,"[""Gruppo Italiano di Farmacovigilanza nell'Anziano Investigators""]",20050825,PMC1201137,,,,,,,,,,,

Imatinib is approved for the treatment of chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) and gastrointestinal stromal tumour (GIST), which have dysregulated activity of an imatinib-sensitive kinase as the underlying pathogenetic feature. Pharmacokinetic studies of imatinib in healthy volunteers and patients with CML, GIST and other cancers show that orally administered imatinib is well absorbed, and has an absolute bioavailability of 98% irrespective of oral dosage form (solution, capsule, tablet) or dosage strength (100 mg, 400 mg). Food has no relevant impact on the rate or extent of bioavailability. The terminal elimination half-life is approximately 18 hours. Imatinib plasma concentrations predictably increase by 2- to 3-fold when reaching steady state with 400mg once-daily administration, to 2.6 +/- 0.8 microg/mL at peak and 1.2 +/- 0.8 microg/mL at trough, exceeding the 0.5 microg/mL (1 micromol/L) concentrations needed for tyrosine kinase inhibition in vitro and leading to normalisation of haematological parameters in the large majority of patients with CML irrespective of baseline white blood cell count. Imatinib is approximately 95% bound to human plasma proteins, mainly albumin and alpha1-acid glycoprotein. The drug is eliminated predominantly via the bile in the form of metabolites, one of which (CGP 74588) shows comparable pharmacological activity to the parent drug. The faecal to urinary excretion ratio is approximately 5:1. Imatinib is metabolised mainly by the cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4 or CYP3A5 and can competitively inhibit the metabolism of drugs that are CYP3A4 or CYP3A5 substrates. Interactions may occur between imatinib and inhibitors or inducers of these enzymes, leading to changes in the plasma concentration of imatinib as well as coadministered drugs. Hepatic and renal dysfunction, and the presence of liver metastases, may result in more variable and increased exposure to the drug, although typically not necessitating dosage adjustment. Age (range 18-70 years), race, sex and bodyweight do not appreciably impact the pharmacokinetics of imatinib.","['Peng, Bin', 'Lloyd, Peter', 'Schran, Horst']","['Peng B', 'Lloyd P', 'Schran H']","['Oncology, Clinical Pharmacology, Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation, Florham Park, New Jersey 07936-1080, USA. bin.peng@pharma.novartis.com']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Switzerland,Clin Pharmacokinet,Clinical pharmacokinetics,7606849,IM,"['Absorption', 'Animals', 'Benzamides', 'Drug Interactions', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Metabolic Clearance Rate', 'Microdialysis', 'Piperazines/*pharmacokinetics', 'Pyrimidines/*pharmacokinetics', 'Tissue Distribution']",2005/08/27 09:00,2005/12/15 09:00,['2005/08/27 09:00'],"['2005/08/27 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/12/15 09:00 [medline]', '2005/08/27 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Clin Pharmacokinet. 2005;44(9):879-94. doi: 10.2165/00003088-200544090-00001.,,"['0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)']",78,"['4491 [pii]', '10.2165/00003088-200544090-00001 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

STUDY DESIGN: Comparative image morphometry using hematoxylin-eosin-stained and CD 61-stained trephine biopsies was carried out on 40 cases of MDS and 10 normal subjects to analyze the megakaryocytes objectively. The various variables analyzed were number of megakaryocytes and micromegakaryocytes, area, perimeter and diameter of the megakaryocytic elements. RESULTS: The mean number of megakaryocytes was lower in cases of MDS as compared to the normals in all except for a single case of hypoplastic MDS, in which the megakaryocytes were more abundant (3.6 per high-power field [hpf]). No micromegakaryocytes were observed in the 2 cases of chronic myelomonocytic leukemia. The mean area, perimeter and diameter of megakaryocytes decreased significantly on immunostaining with CD 61. CONCLUSION: The mean number of megakaryocytes per hpf was lower in the cases of MDS as compared to normal cases on hematoxylin-eosin. However, on CD 61 staining the number of megakaryocytes per hpf increased in cases of MDS. Micromegakaryocytes were seen in scanty numbers in the normals but increased in MDS cases and increased significantly on CD 61 immunostaining. The mean area, perimeter and diameter of megakaryocytes decreased significantly on immunostaining with CD 61, indicating the increased numbers of micromegakaryocytes in MDS. Hence, immunostaining is an efficient method of detecting increased numbers of megakaryocytes and micromegakaryocytes that would ordinarily be missed by using routine hematoxylin-eosin staining.","['Das, Reena', 'Hayer, Jasreman', 'Dey, Pranab', 'Garewal, Gurjeewan']","['Das R', 'Hayer J', 'Dey P', 'Garewal G']","['Department of Haematology, Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education & Research, Chandigarh, India.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,Anal Quant Cytol Histol,Analytical and quantitative cytology and histology,8506819,IM,"['Anemia, Aplastic/metabolism/pathology', 'Anemia, Refractory/metabolism/pathology', 'Anemia, Refractory, with Excess of Blasts/metabolism/pathology', 'Anemia, Sideroblastic/metabolism/pathology', 'Biopsy', 'Bone Marrow Cells/chemistry/*pathology', 'Cell Count', 'Histocytochemistry', 'Humans', 'Image Cytometry/*methods', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Integrin beta3/analysis/immunology', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Chronic/metabolism/pathology', 'Megakaryocytes/chemistry/pathology', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/metabolism/*pathology', 'Statistics, Nonparametric']",2005/08/27 09:00,2005/10/21 09:00,['2005/08/27 09:00'],"['2005/08/27 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/10/21 09:00 [medline]', '2005/08/27 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Anal Quant Cytol Histol. 2005 Jun;27(3):152-6.,,"['0 (ITGB3 protein, human)', '0 (Integrin beta3)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In confocal dual-color images, in order to consider a given position as colocalized, the following two conditions must be satisfied: 1) the colors emitted by the molecules labeled with different fluorophores must occupy the same pixel in the image and 2) the intensities of each component of the image must be within a certain range. Since it is not straightforward to assess these two conditions without ambiguity, this can lead to either considering false colocalizations as positive, or, conversely, leaving out positive locations. In fact, at present, there is not a general procedure to determine the area of colocalization that contains those pixels that can be considered as really colocalized (i.e., the pixels for which the above conditions are fulfilled). As a result, it is the user who must decide on the appropriate selection which introduces personal bias.

The eventual success of many strategies may also depend on their ability to elicit a strong antitumor immune response. Unsurprisingly, therefore, the focus of this meeting, the first of the International Society of Cancer Gene Therapy, was on new strategies currently in preclinical development that address these problems, and relatively little new clinical information was presented. There was much interest in a new class of therapeutic genes, those encoding fusogenic membrane glycoproteins, which are very toxic and have the potential to elicit a potent bystander effect and a strong immunogenic response. The aim of another strategy that shows considerable promise is to improve the toxicity of replication-conditional adenoviruses by replacing deleted adenoviral genes with cytotoxic or suicide genes. Disappointingly, there was little discussion of new vector systems that might improve gene delivery. The most exciting development in ex vivo immunogene therapies presented was progress towards the development of a streamlined 'off the shelf' immunogene therapy for relapsing leukemia patients who have undergone bone marrow transplants. In addition, a few promising immunotherapies were discussed that may provide several starting points for the development of new gene therapies that are effective in eliciting tumor immunogenicity.","['Zarkowska, T']",['Zarkowska T'],"['Current Drugs Ltd, Middlesex House, 34-42 Cleveland Street, London W1P 6LB, United Kingdom. tamaraz@cursci.co.uk']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,IDrugs,IDrugs : the investigational drugs journal,100883655,,,2005/08/27 09:00,2005/08/27 09:01,['2005/08/27 09:00'],"['2005/08/27 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/08/27 09:01 [medline]', '2005/08/27 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,IDrugs. 1999 Sep;2(9):877-81.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This intensive regimen included an induction phase (mitoxantrone plus cytarabine), two consolidation courses, one containing timed-sequential high-dose cytarabine, asparaginase and amsacrine; 276 (90%) achieved a CR. The 5-year overall survival (OS) and event-free survival (EFS) were 60+/-4 and 48+/-4%, respectively. From 1997, timed-sequencing of the LAME SP induction chemotherapy led to an unacceptable frequency of consolidation delay; future improvements are unlikely to come from further increases in intensity. The role of allogenic bone-marrow transplantation from an HLA-identical sibling in CR1 was examined. The disease-free survival (DFS) was 52+/-4% for non-allografted patients and 57+/-7% for allografted patients (P=NS); a better OS for allografted patients was shown and could be related either to allo-BMT early in CR1 or to a second allo-BMT in CR2. For the complete responders after consolidation therapy, the 5-year OS was significantly better in patients randomized for no maintenance therapy (MT-) than in patients randomized for MT (77.6+/-8 vs 59+/-8%; P=0.05), while the 5-year DFS was not significantly different.

To explore mechanisms of disease-specific HDI activity in acute myeloid leukaemia (AML), we have characterised expression of all 18 members of the histone deacetylase family in primary AML blasts and in four control cell types, namely CD34+ progenitors from umbilical cord, either quiescent or cycling (post-culture), cycling CD34+ progenitors from GCSF-stimulated adult donors and peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Only SIRT1 was consistently overexpressed (>2 fold) in AML samples compared with all controls, while HDAC6 was overexpressed relative to adult, but not neo-natal cells. HDAC5 and SIRT4 were consistently underexpressed. AML blasts and cell lines, exposed to HDIs in culture, showed both histone hyperacetylation and, unexpectedly, specific hypermethylation of H3 lysine 4. Such treatment also modulated the pattern of HDAC expression, with strong induction of HDAC11 in all myeloid cells tested and with all inhibitors (valproate, butyrate, TSA, SAHA), and lesser, more selective, induction of HDAC9 and SIRT4. The distinct pattern of HDAC expression in AML and its response to HDIs is of relevance to the development of HDI-based therapeutic strategies and may contribute to observed patterns of clinical response and development of drug resistance.","['Bradbury, C A', 'Khanim, F L', 'Hayden, R', 'Bunce, C M', 'White, D A', 'Drayson, M T', 'Craddock, C', 'Turner, B M']","['Bradbury CA', 'Khanim FL', 'Hayden R', 'Bunce CM', 'White DA', 'Drayson MT', 'Craddock C', 'Turner BM']","['Institute of Biomedical Research, University of Birmingham Medical School, Birmingham B15 2TT, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Acetylation', 'Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Antigens, CD34/metabolism', 'Butyrates/pharmacology', 'DNA Methylation', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', '*Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors', 'Histone Deacetylases/*metabolism', 'Histones/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Hydroxamic Acids/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/drug therapy/*enzymology/genetics', 'Myeloid Cells', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Valproic Acid/pharmacology', 'Vorinostat']",2005/08/27 09:00,2005/11/05 09:00,['2005/08/27 09:00'],"['2005/08/27 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/11/05 09:00 [medline]', '2005/08/27 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2005 Oct;19(10):1751-9. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2403910.,,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Butyrates)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors)', '0 (Histones)', '0 (Hydroxamic Acids)', '3X2S926L3Z (trichostatin A)', '58IFB293JI (Vorinostat)', '614OI1Z5WI (Valproic Acid)', 'EC 3.5.1.98 (Histone Deacetylases)']",,"['2403910 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.leu.2403910 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Moreover, WT1 is also overexpressed in a vast number of nonhematological solid tumors, thereby expanding its use as a promising target for cancer vaccines. Examples of spontaneous immune responses against WT1 and Pr3 in leukemia patients are presented and the potential of WT1 and Pr3 for adoptive T-cell immunotherapy of leukemia is discussed. We also elaborate on the use of professional antigen-presenting cells loaded with mRNA encoding WT1 exploiting the advantage of broad HLA coverage for therapeutic vaccination purposes.

The patient prefers to remain anonymous; therefore, I am listed here as the contact person to whom queries to the author can be referred. We believe that her insights are particularly important for those working in the field. As we investigate the molecular substrates of psychiatric disorders, it is crucial to keep in mind the clinical entities that are addressed in our research. The patient's words provide a deep understanding of real suffering that is overcome by effective treatment in the context of a highly supportive social structure. In her own words, 'I was terrified that I could feel so wrecked inside, terrified that something was horribly wrong with me and terrified that I didn't know how to tell anyone that I was slipping into a dark place. My struggle with bipolar disorder forced me to leave an Ivy League university and endure six hospitalizations during my early adulthood. After countless medication trials, I was successful on clozapine and graduated from college and then graduate school. My medications remind me each day of my struggle with mental illness but also of my recovery. I am relishing my life as a happily married woman, a beloved daughter and sister, and as a psychologist.' One important item illustrated in this narrative is that clinical symptoms can be worsened by some treatments and positively affected by others. While some in the field erroneously believe that better treatment approaches depend exclusively on new drugs, this perspective shows how important it is to optimize the use of existing compounds. For some diseases like acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) of childhood, rates of remission and cure have been constantly advancing through better use of existing compounds. In the last 20 years, without the advent of new drugs for that disease, new protocols for ALL have solely optimized the use of existing drugs. It is likewise crucial to advance the optimization of psychiatric treatments by identifying predictors of treatment response, possibly by pharmacogenomic approaches, which have the potential to individualize the use of existing treatments. This could rapidly decrease the enormous burden of psychiatric disorders, which is eloquently described in this perspective article.","['Licinio, J']",['Licinio J'],"['Center for Pharmacogenomics & Clinical Pharmacology, Semel Institute for Neuroscience and Human Behavior and David Geffen School of Medicine at University of California, Los Angeles, CA 90095-1761, USA. licinio@ucla.edu']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",England,Mol Psychiatry,Molecular psychiatry,9607835,IM,"['Adult', 'Bipolar Disorder/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Mood Disorders/*genetics']",2005/08/27 09:00,2005/11/09 09:00,['2005/08/27 09:00'],"['2005/08/27 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/11/09 09:00 [medline]', '2005/08/27 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Mol Psychiatry. 2005 Sep;10(9):827-30. doi: 10.1038/sj.mp.4001717.,,,,"['4001717 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.mp.4001717 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It was only rarely described with mantle cell lymphoma (MCL). Our study was performed to elucidate the clinical, histologic, immunopathological, and molecular characteristics of insect bite like reaction (IBLR) associated with MCL. The clinical presentation and histologic findings in 3 IBLR cases associated with MCL were found to be similar to 3 IBLR cases associated with CLL. The eruptions consisted of itchy erythematous papules, nodules, plaques, and vesicles. Non-vesicular lesions were characterized histologically by normal or mildly spongiotic epidermis. Vesicular lesions were characterized by marked spongiosis and intraepidermal spongiotic vesicles containing eosinophils, or marked subepidermal edema occasionally leading to a dermoepidermal separation. Most of the lesions were characterized by superficial and mid dermal to deep perivascular and interstitial, and occasionally periadnexal, inflammatory-cell infiltrate consisting of mononuclear cells and eosinophils. The densities of the infiltrates varied and the inflammatory-cell infiltrate extended often into the fat lobules. Neutrophils and nuclear dust were found more frequently and abundantly in the IBLR lesions associated with MCL. Immunophenotyping, direct immunofluorescence (DIF) tests, and IgH gene rearrangement studies were performed in the lesions associated with MCL only. The majority of the infiltrating lymphocytes were CD3+, CD5+ and CD43+, more CD4+ than CD8+, and only a small minority was CD20+. The cells did not stain for bcl-1 protein and CD30, and with no evidence of clonality. The DIF test result was negative. The IBLR eruption associated with MCL resembles clinically and histologically IBLR associated with CLL. The eruption seems to be reactive rather than neoplastic, because there is no evidence of MCL involvement in the skin lesions.","['Khamaysi, Z', 'Dodiuk-Gad, R P', 'Weltfriend, S', 'Ben-Arieh, Y', 'Dann, E J', 'Sahar, D', 'Bergman, R']","['Khamaysi Z', 'Dodiuk-Gad RP', 'Weltfriend S', 'Ben-Arieh Y', 'Dann EJ', 'Sahar D', 'Bergman R']","['Department of Dermatology, Rambam Medical Center, Haifa, Israel.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Am J Dermatopathol,The American Journal of dermatopathology,7911005,IM,"['Animals', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Gene Rearrangement, B-Lymphocyte/immunology', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Insect Bites and Stings/pathology', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/pathology', 'Lymphoma, Mantle-Cell/*complications/*pathology', 'Skin Diseases/*etiology/*immunology/*pathology']",2005/08/27 09:00,2005/12/13 09:00,['2005/08/27 09:00'],"['2005/08/27 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/12/13 09:00 [medline]', '2005/08/27 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Am J Dermatopathol. 2005 Aug;27(4):290-5. doi: 10.1097/01.dad.0000164607.41402.40.,,,,"['00000372-200508000-00003 [pii]', '10.1097/01.dad.0000164607.41402.40 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In a matched pair study, we assessed whether Infliximab is associated with an increased risk of neoplasia. METHODS: In a multicentre matched pair study, 404 CD patients treated with Infliximab (CD-IFX) were matched with 404 CD patients who had never received Infliximab (CD-C). Cases and controls were matched for sex, age (+/-5 years), site of CD, age at diagnosis (+/-5 years), immunosuppressant use, and follow up. New diagnoses of neoplasia from April 1999 to October 2004 were recorded. RESULTS: Among the 404 CD-IFX, neoplasia was diagnosed in nine patients (2.22%) while among the 404 CD-C, seven patients developed neoplasia (1.73%) (odds ratio 1.33 (95% confidence interval 0.46-3.84); p=0.40). The survival curve adjusted for patient year of follow up showed no differences between CD-IFX and CD-C (p=0.90; log rank test). In the CD-IFX group, there was one cholangiocarcinoma, three breast cancers, one skin cancer, one leukaemia, one laryngeal cancer, and two anal carcinomas. Among the 7/404 (1.73%) CD-C, there were three intestinal adenocarcinomas (two caecum, one rectum), one basalioma, one spinalioma, one non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, and one breast cancer. Age at diagnosis of neoplasia did not differ between groups (CD-IFX v CD-C: median 50 (range 40-70 years) v 45 (27-72); p=0.50). CONCLUSION: In our multicentre matched pair study, the frequency of a new diagnosis of neoplasia in CD patients treated with Infliximab was comparable with CD patients who had never received Infliximab.","['Biancone, L', 'Orlando, A', 'Kohn, A', 'Colombo, E', 'Sostegni, R', 'Angelucci, E', 'Rizzello, F', 'Castiglione, F', 'Benazzato, L', 'Papi, C', 'Meucci, G', 'Riegler, G', 'Petruzziello, C', 'Mocciaro, F', 'Geremia, A', 'Calabrese, E', 'Cottone, M', 'Pallone, F']","['Biancone L', 'Orlando A', 'Kohn A', 'Colombo E', 'Sostegni R', 'Angelucci E', 'Rizzello F', 'Castiglione F', 'Benazzato L', 'Papi C', 'Meucci G', 'Riegler G', 'Petruzziello C', 'Mocciaro F', 'Geremia A', 'Calabrese E', 'Cottone M', 'Pallone F']","['GI Unit, Centre of Excellence for the Study of Complex and Multifactorial Diseases, Tor Vergata University, Roma 00131, and V Cervello Hospital, Palermo, Italy. biancone@med.uniroma2.it']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",England,Gut,Gut,2985108R,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Crohn Disease/complications/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Epidemiologic Methods', 'Female', 'Gastrointestinal Agents/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Infliximab', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms/*chemically induced', 'Smoking/adverse effects', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/antagonists & inhibitors']",2005/08/27 09:00,2006/02/14 09:00,['2005/08/27 09:00'],"['2005/08/27 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/02/14 09:00 [medline]', '2005/08/27 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Gut. 2006 Feb;55(2):228-33. doi: 10.1136/gut.2005.075937.

Offspring of 550,000 mothers in Finland and Iceland were combined to form a joint cohort that was followed for cancer up to age 15 years during 1975-1997 through national cancer registries. For each index mother-case pair, three or four matched control mother-control pairs were identified from population registers. First-trimester serum samples were retrieved from mothers of 341 acute lymphoblastic leukemia cases and 61 other leukemia cases and from 1,212 control mothers. Sera were tested for antibodies to the genus Chlamydia, Helicobacter pylori, and Mycoplasma pneumoniae. Odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals, adjusted for sibship size, were calculated as estimates of relative risk. M. pneumoniae immunoglobulin M appeared to be associated with increased risk (odds ratio (OR) = 1.6), but the association lost statistical significance when the specificity of the immunoglobulin M was considered (OR = 1.5, 95% confidence interval: 0.9, 2.4). In Iceland, H. pylori immunoglobulin G was associated with increased risk of childhood leukemia in offspring (OR = 2.8, 95% confidence interval: 1.1, 6.9).

Therefore, the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) genome of HL-60, a promyelocytic leukemia cell line, has been completely sequenced by four laboratories and will be available to the forensic and medical communities in the spring of 2003; it will be called National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) SRM 2392-I. NIST human mtDNA SRM 2392 will continue to be available and includes the DNA from two apparently healthy individuals. Both SRM 2392 and 2392-I contain all the information (e.g. the sequences of 58 unique primer sets) needed to use these SRMs as positive controls for the amplification and sequencing any DNA. Compared to the templates in SRM 2392, the HL-60 mtDNA in SRM 2392-I has two tRNA differences and more polymorphisms resulting in amino acid changes. Four of these HL-60 mtDNA polymorphisms have been associated with Leber Hereditary Optic Neuropathy (LHON), one as an intermediate mutation and three as secondary mutations. The mtDNA from a cell line (GM10742A) from an individual with LHON was also completely sequenced for comparison and contained some of the same LHON mutations. The combination of these particular LHON associated mutations is also found in phylogenetic haplogroup J and its subset, J2, and may only be indicative that HL-60 belongs to haplogroup J, one of nine haplogroups that characterize Caucasian individuals of European descent or may mean that haplogroup J is more prone to LHON. Both these mtDNA SRMs will provide enhanced quality control in forensic identification, medical diagnosis, and single nucleotide polymorphism detection.","['Levin, Barbara C', 'Holland, Koren A', 'Hancock, Diane K', 'Coble, Michael', 'Parsons, Thomas J', 'Kienker, Laura J', 'Williams, Diana W', 'Jones, Marypat', 'Richie, Kristy L']","['Levin BC', 'Holland KA', 'Hancock DK', 'Coble M', 'Parsons TJ', 'Kienker LJ', 'Williams DW', 'Jones M', 'Richie KL']","['National Institute of Standards and Technology, 100 Bureau Drive, Mail Stop 8311, Gaithersburg, MD 20899-8311, USA. barbara.levin@nist.gov']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Netherlands,Mitochondrion,Mitochondrion,100968751,,,2005/08/27 09:00,2005/08/27 09:01,['2005/08/27 09:00'],"['2002/12/12 00:00 [received]', '2003/01/26 00:00 [revised]', '2003/01/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2002/12/12 00:00 [received]', '2003/01/26 00:00 [revised]', '2003/01/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2005/08/27 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/08/27 09:01 [medline]', '2005/08/27 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Mitochondrion. 2003 Jun;2(6):387-400. doi: 10.1016/S1567-7249(03)00010-2.,,,,"['S1567-7249(03)00010-2 [pii]', '10.1016/S1567-7249(03)00010-2 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Subsequently, radiolabelling technologies have made it possible to chelate radioactive isotopes to monoclonal antibodies, which retain their specificity and take advantage of targeted delivery of localised radiation. Radioimmunoconjugates are an attractive therapeutic option for lymphomas due to the inherent sensitivity to radiotherapy, the fact that the local emission of ionising radiation by radiolabelled antibodies may kill cells with or without the target antigen in close proximity to the bound antibody, and penetrating radiation may obviate the problem of limited antibody penetration into bulky, poorly vascularised tumours.

Alternative therapeutic options based on correction of the defective gene by retroviral gene delivery have been used to correct X-linked SCID (SCID-X1) and adenosine deaminase-deficient SCID (ADA-SCID).

The development of leukaemia as a result of insertional mutagenesis in one trial of gene therapy for SCID-X1 has raised concerns regarding the toxicity of retroviral vector-based gene delivery.

The ability to penetrate into the live human fibroblasts was studied for the three bis-Hoechst compounds. The fluorescence intensity of nuclei of live and fixed cells stained with the penta- and heptamethylene-linked bis-Hoechst analogues was found to differ only slightly, whereas the fluorescence of the nuclei of live cells stained with triethylene oxide-linked bis-Hoechst was considerably weaker than that of the fixed cells.

The patients were randomized to receive either high-dose chemotherapy with autologous stem cell support (HDC) or intermediate-dose chemotherapy (IDC) in the adjuvant setting. METHODS: Two hundred forty-six patients with AJCC Stage IIA, IIB, or IIIA breast carcinoma who had > or = 10 positive lymph nodes and who were participants in Cancer and Leukemia Group B (CALGB) 9082 were enrolled in this companion study, CALGB 9066. Patients were randomized to receive either high-dose cyclophosphamide, carmustine, and cisplatin (CPA/cDDP/BCNU) and autologous bone marrow transplantation (the HDC arm) or intermediate-dose CPA/cDDP/BCNU as consolidation to adjuvant chemotherapy (the IDC arm). QOL was assessed at baseline and at 3 months, 12 months, 24 months, and 36 months using the Functional Living Index-Cancer (FLIC), the Psychosocial Adjustment to Illness Scale (PAIS)-Self Report, and the McCorkle Symptom Distress Scale (SDS). RESULTS: At the 3-month assessment, patients in the HDC arm demonstrated significant worsening of QOL compared with the IDC arm in terms of their physical well being (FLIC, P = 0.023), social functioning (FLIC, P = 0.026; PAIS, P < 0.0001), symptom distress (SDS, P = 0.0002), and total QOL scores (FLIC, P = 0.042). At 12 months, the differences in QOL scores between the HDC arm and the IDC arm had resolved. CONCLUSIONS: Patients who received more intensive adjuvant therapy experienced transient declines in QOL. By 12 months after therapy, QOL was comparable between the 2 arms, regardless of therapy intensity, and many QOL areas were improved from baseline.","['Peppercorn, Jeffrey', 'Herndon, James 2nd', 'Kornblith, Alice B', 'Peters, William', 'Ahles, Tim', 'Vredenburgh, James', 'Schwartz, Gary', 'Shpall, Elizabeth', 'Hurd, David D', 'Holland, Jimmie', 'Winer, Eric']","['Peppercorn J', 'Herndon J 2nd', 'Kornblith AB', 'Peters W', 'Ahles T', 'Vredenburgh J', 'Schwartz G', 'Shpall E', 'Hurd DD', 'Holland J', 'Winer E']","['Department of Medical Oncology, Dana Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, Massachusetts 02115, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*administration & dosage', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Breast Neoplasms/psychology/*therapy', 'Carmustine/administration & dosage', 'Chemotherapy, Adjuvant', 'Cisplatin/administration & dosage', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Cyclophosphamide/administration & dosage', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Staging', '*Quality of Life', 'Survival Rate', 'Time Factors', 'Transplantation, Autologous']",2005/08/25 09:00,2006/01/13 09:00,['2005/08/25 09:00'],"['2005/08/25 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/01/13 09:00 [medline]', '2005/08/25 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer. 2005 Oct 15;104(8):1580-9. doi: 10.1002/cncr.21363.,"['CA02599/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA03927/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA04326/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA04457/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA07968/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA08025/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA11789/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA14028/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA16450/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA21060/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA31809/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA31946/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA31983/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA32291/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA33601/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA35279/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA37135/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA41287/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA42777/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA47545/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA47559/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA47577/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA47642/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA60138/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA77440/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA77651/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'Q20Q21Q62J (Cisplatin)', 'U68WG3173Y (Carmustine)']",,['10.1002/cncr.21363 [doi]'],,['Copyright 2005 American Cancer Society'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Both acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and chronic myeloproliferative disorders have a variety of underlying cytogenetic defects that can be evaluated by loss of heterozygosity (LOH) studies. LOH studies have advantages over conventional cytogenetics by allowing the use of archival tissues. We evaluated the spleens in AML and chronic myeloproliferative disorders with neoplastic myeloid proliferations for the presence of LOH at several chromosome loci, and X-chromosome inactivation. A total of 17 spleens were evaluated (chronic myelogenous leukemia = 6; chronic idiopathic myelofibrosis = 6; essential thrombocythemia = 1; AML arising from previous chronic myeloproliferative disorders = 4). We examined LOH loci 7q (D7S2554), 8q (D8S263), 9p (D9S157, D9S161), 13q (D13S319), common sites of genetic abnormality in chronic myeloproliferative disorders, and TP53. In six cases, spleen LOH findings were compared to those of concurrent or preceding bone marrow biopsies. Five spleens of female patients were evaluated for the presence of clonality using X-chromosome inactivation. Of the 16 cases analyzed, 14 (88%) had at least one abnormal LOH locus, with 6/16 with two abnormal loci. The abnormalities were distributed as follows: D9S161-7/15 (47%), TP53-6/16 (38%), D7S2554-5/16 (31%), D9S157-5/15 (33%), D8S263-3/14 (21%), and D13S319-2/14 (14%). Of the six bone marrows, 4/6 showed concordance in bone marrow and spleen specimens, with additional LOH abnormalities being identified in the spleen specimens of all four cases.

In various types of cultured cells, 3 BH3-only proteins, namely Puma (p53 up-regulated modulator of apoptosis), Noxa, and Bim (Bcl-2 interacting mediator of cell death), have been shown to initiate p53-dependent as well as p53-independent apoptosis in response to DNA damage and treatment with anticancer drugs or glucocorticoids. In particular, the absence of Puma or Bim renders thymocytes and mature lymphocytes refractory to varying degrees to death induced in vitro by growth factor withdrawal, DNA damage, or glucocorticoids. To assess the in vivo relevance of these findings, we subjected mice lacking Puma, Noxa, or Bim to whole-body gamma-radiation or the glucocorticoid dexamethasone and compared lymphocyte survival with that in wild-type and BCL2-transgenic mice. Absence of Puma or Bcl-2 overexpression efficiently protected diverse types of lymphocytes from the effects of gamma-radiation in vivo, and loss of Bim provided lower but significant protection in most lymphocytes, whereas Noxa deficiency had no impact. Furthermore, both Puma and Bim were found to contribute significantly to glucocorticoid-induced killing. Our results thus establish that Puma and Bim are key initiators of gamma-radiation- and glucocorticoid-induced apoptosis in lymphoid cells in vivo.","['Erlacher, Miriam', 'Michalak, Ewa M', 'Kelly, Priscilla N', 'Labi, Verena', 'Niederegger, Harald', 'Coultas, Leigh', 'Adams, Jerry M', 'Strasser, Andreas', 'Villunger, Andreas']","['Erlacher M', 'Michalak EM', 'Kelly PN', 'Labi V', 'Niederegger H', 'Coultas L', 'Adams JM', 'Strasser A', 'Villunger A']","['Division of Experimental Pathophysiology & Immunology, Biocenter, Innsbruck Medical University, A-6020 Innsbruck, Austria.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects/*radiation effects', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/deficiency/genetics/*metabolism', 'Bcl-2-Like Protein 11', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Dexamethasone/pharmacology', 'Gamma Rays', 'Glucocorticoids/*pharmacology', 'Lymphocytes/cytology/*drug effects/*radiation effects', 'Membrane Proteins/deficiency/genetics/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/deficiency/genetics/*metabolism', 'Spleen/cytology/drug effects/metabolism/radiation effects', 'Thymus Gland/cytology/drug effects/metabolism/radiation effects', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/deficiency/genetics/*metabolism']",2005/08/25 09:00,2006/01/07 09:00,['2005/08/25 09:00'],"['2005/08/25 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/01/07 09:00 [medline]', '2005/08/25 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 2005 Dec 15;106(13):4131-8. doi: 10.1182/blood-2005-04-1595.

To investigate Notch signaling in B-cell malignancy, we assayed the effect of Notch activation in multiple murine and human B-cell tumors, representing both immature and mature subtypes. Expression of constitutively active, truncated forms of the 4 mammalian Notch receptors (ICN1-4) inhibited growth and induced apoptosis in both murine and human B-cell lines but not T-cell lines. Similar results were obtained in human precursor B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia lines when Notch activation was achieved by coculture with fibroblasts expressing the Notch ligands Jagged1 or Jagged2. All 4 truncated Notch receptors, as well as the Jagged ligands, induced Hes1 transcription. Retroviral expression of Hairy/Enhancer of Split-1 (Hes1) recapitulated the Notch effects, suggesting that Hes1 is an important mediator of Notch-induced growth arrest and apoptosis in B cells. Among the B-cell malignancies that were susceptible to Notch-mediated growth inhibition/apoptosis were mature B-cell and therapy-resistant B-cell malignancies, including Hodgkin, myeloma, and mixed-lineage leukemia (MLL)-translocated cell lines.

Support vector machines (SVMs) have been found to be successful with a recursive procedure in selecting important genes for cancer prediction. However, it is not well understood how much of the success depends on the choice of the specific classifier and how much on the recursive procedure. We answer this question by examining multiple classifers [SVM, ridge regression (RR) and Rocchio] with feature selection in recursive and non-recursive settings on three DNA microarray datasets (ALL-AML Leukemia data, Breast Cancer data and GCM data). RESULTS: We found recursive RR most effective. On the AML-ALL dataset, it achieved zero error rate on the test set using only three genes (selected from over 7000), which is more encouraging than the best published result (zero error rate using 8 genes by recursive SVM). On the Breast Cancer dataset and the two largest categories of the GCM dataset, the results achieved by recursive RR are also very encouraging. A further analysis of the experimental results shows that different classifiers penalize redundant features to different extent and this property plays an important role in the recursive feature selection process. RR classifier tends to penalize redundant features to a much larger extent than the SVM does. This may be the reason why recursive RR has a better performance in selecting genes.","['Li, Fan', 'Yang, Yiming']","['Li F', 'Yang Y']","['Language Technology Institute 4502 NSH Carnegie Mellon University 5000 Forbes Avenue, Pittsburgh, PA 15213, USA. hustlf@cs.cmu.edu']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article', 'Validation Study']",England,Bioinformatics,"Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)",9808944,IM,"['*Algorithms', 'Animals', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*metabolism', 'Feedback', 'Gene Expression Profiling/*methods', 'Humans', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*metabolism', 'Neoplasms/*metabolism', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis/*methods', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Software Validation']",2005/08/25 09:00,2005/12/13 09:00,['2005/08/25 09:00'],"['2005/08/25 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/12/13 09:00 [medline]', '2005/08/25 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Bioinformatics. 2005 Oct 1;21(19):3741-7. doi: 10.1093/bioinformatics/bti618.

Our results indicate that these pathways converge upon the discrete sub-nuclear domains known as PML (promyelocytic leukaemia protein) NBs (nuclear bodies). Proteasome inhibition generated an increased number of PML bodies, without any obvious increase in size. Using a cell line that constitutively expresses an epitope-tagged version of SUMO1, which was incorporated into high-molecular-mass conjugates, we observed SUMO1 accumulating in clusters around a subset of the NBs. Nuclear ubiquitin was initially observed in numerous speckles and foci, which bore no relationship to PML NBs in the absence of proteasome inhibition. However, during proteasome inhibition, total ubiquitin-conjugated species increased in the cell, as judged by Western blotting. Concomitantly the number of nuclear ubiquitin clusters decreased, and were almost quantitatively associated with the PML NBs, co-localizing with the SUMO-conjugated pool. Proteasome inhibition depleted the pool of free SUMO1 in the cell. Reversal of proteasome inhibition in the presence or absence of protein synthesis demonstrated that free SUMO1 was regenerated from the conjugated pool. The results indicate that a significant fraction of the free SUMO1 pool could be accounted for by recycling from the conjugated pool and indeed it may be that, as for ubiquitin, SUMO1 needs to be removed from conjugated species prior to processing by the proteasome. Taken together with other recent reports on the proteasome and PML NBs, these results suggest that the PML NBs may play an important role in integrating these pathways.","['Bailey, Daniel', ""O'Hare, Peter""]","['Bailey D', ""O'Hare P""]","['Marie Curie Research Institute, The Chart, Oxted, Surrey RH8 OTL, UK.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Biochem J,The Biochemical journal,2984726R,IM,"['Cell Line, Tumor', 'Humans', 'Intranuclear Inclusion Bodies/metabolism', 'Leupeptins/pharmacology', 'Neoplasm Proteins/metabolism', 'Nuclear Proteins/metabolism', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex/metabolism', '*Proteasome Inhibitors', 'Protein Processing, Post-Translational/drug effects', 'Protein Transport', 'SUMO-1 Protein', 'Small Ubiquitin-Related Modifier Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/metabolism', 'Ubiquitin/*metabolism']",2005/08/25 09:00,2006/02/24 09:00,['2005/08/25 09:00'],"['2005/08/25 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/02/24 09:00 [medline]', '2005/08/25 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Biochem J. 2005 Dec 1;392(Pt 2):271-81. doi: 10.1042/BJ20050873.,,"['0 (Leupeptins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (Proteasome Inhibitors)', '0 (SUMO-1 Protein)', '0 (SUMO1 protein, human)', '0 (Small Ubiquitin-Related Modifier Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '0 (Ubiquitin)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.25.1 (Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex)', 'RF1P63GW3K (benzyloxycarbonylleucyl-leucyl-leucine aldehyde)']",,"['BJ20050873 [pii]', '10.1042/BJ20050873 [doi]']",,,,,PMC1316262,,,,,,,,,,,

This study aimed at assessment of the rate and stability of a cytogenetic response (CR) and long-term results of survival in CML patients on glivek. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Glivek was given to 195 CML patients (median of the treatment duration was 42 months, 1-156 months, of the patients' age--46 years). 79 patients were in CP, 116--in AP. The doses were 400 mg/day and 116 mg/day, respectively. Karyotype was studied before the treatment and later after each 6 months. RESULTS: A considerable CR was achieved in 57% patients in CP and 44%--in AP. Of them complete CR was obtained in 48 and 35%, respectively. Marked CR is a favourable prognostic factor. Survival of patients with marked CR in CP (97% 0 and AP (89%) was significantly higher than without CR (58 and 47%, respectively, p < 0.05). Marked CR persisted in 95% cases in both phases of CML. In complete CR, a repeated study of karyotype revealed residual number of Ph+ cells both in CP and AP in 86% patients. This demonstrates necessity to take glivek continuously in achievement of a complete CR by karyotypic test. Glivek inhibits the disease progression, lowers annual lethality. 42-month (median of glivek treatment duration) overall survival reached 91 and 59% in CP and AP, respectively.

MATERIAL AND METHODS: Autotransplantation (AT) was conducted as consolidation of a complete or partial remission in 20 patients with multiple myeloma, 14 patients with lymphogranulomatosis and lymphosarcoma, 7 patients with acute leukemia and 1 patient with rabdomyosarcoma. The program of pretransplantation conditioning corresponded to the disease form and included: melphalan, BEAM, busulphane-cyclophosphamide. The number of transplanted CD34+ cells was 1.7-20.1 (median 5.3) x l0(6) cell/kg. The transplantation was followed by selective intestinal decontamination and mycosis prophylaxis. Fever was managed with antibiotics. RESULTS: An early period after AT ran without febrile episodes in 7 (17%) patients. This allowed physicians to avoid systemic antibiotic therapy. The infectious focus was not definitely localized in 35 patients with febrile fever in 77% cases. Clinically and bacteriologically verified infections were detected in 8 (19%) patients: 7 cases of pneumonia and 1 of bacteriemia. None of the patients died of infection early after AT. Not a single case of invasive aspergillesis was registered. CONCLUSION: Incidence and features of infections did not vary with the above diseases and did not depend on the dose of transplanted CD34+ cells. The kind of high-dose conditioning had a significant influence on the time of granulocyte recovery, duration of agranulocytosis, duration of one febrile episode and of antibiotic therapy. The dose of transplanted CD34+ cells also influenced the time of granulocyte recovery and duration of antibiotic therapy.","['Mendeleeva, L P', 'Mitish, N E', 'Kliasova, G A', 'Petrova, N A', 'Liubimova, L S', 'Gribanova, E O', 'Pokrovskaia, O S', 'Garanzha, T A', 'Kostina, I E', 'Kalinin, N N', 'Gretsov, E M', 'Savchenko, V G']","['Mendeleeva LP', 'Mitish NE', 'Kliasova GA', 'Petrova NA', 'Liubimova LS', 'Gribanova EO', 'Pokrovskaia OS', 'Garanzha TA', 'Kostina IE', 'Kalinin NN', 'Gretsov EM', 'Savchenko VG']",,['rus'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",Russia (Federation),Ter Arkh,Terapevticheskii arkhiv,2984818R,IM,"['Adult', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents', 'Bacteremia/drug therapy/*etiology/microbiology', 'Bronchoalveolar Lavage Fluid/microbiology', 'Drug Therapy, Combination/therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*therapy', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*adverse effects', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Pneumocystis carinii/isolation & purification', 'Pneumonia, Pneumocystis/drug therapy/*etiology/microbiology', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Factors', 'Staphylococcal Infections/drug therapy/*etiology/microbiology', 'Staphylococcus/isolation & purification', 'Time Factors', 'Transplantation Conditioning', 'Transplantation, Autologous']",2005/08/25 09:00,2005/09/16 09:00,['2005/08/25 09:00'],"['2005/08/25 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/09/16 09:00 [medline]', '2005/08/25 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Ter Arkh. 2005;77(7):33-9.,,['0 (Anti-Bacterial Agents)'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

MATERIAL AND METHOD: The analysis of examination was made for 72 patients with primary MDS in the groups formed by number of blasts in BM, karyotype and IPSS variant. MDS was diagnosed by WHO criteria. Transformation into AML was established in blastosis > 20% in peripheral blood and/or BM. The karyotype was studied according to GTG technique. RESULTS: More frequent progression of MDS was seen in patients with blastosis > 10%, unfavourable karyotype and high IPSS risk. The least number of leukemic transformations occurred in karyotype of intermediate prognosis while disease-free survival in patients with karyotype of good prognosis was similar to that of patients with unfavourable karyotype. The number of blasts in BM and IPSS variant appeared to be prognostic markers of duration of leukemia-free survival in one-factor analysis. The multifactorial analysis found out one factor of MDS transformation in AML: number of blasts in BM puncture biopsy. CONCLUSION: Prognostic priority of the number of BM blasts as a risk factor of MDS progression compared to karyotype is explained by biological heterogenicity of MDS.","['Gritsaev, S V', 'Martynkevich, I S', 'Abdulkadyrov, K M', 'Tiranova, S A', 'Kakai, M P', 'Martynenko, L S', 'Dziavgo, L A']","['Gritsaev SV', 'Martynkevich IS', 'Abdulkadyrov KM', 'Tiranova SA', 'Kakai MP', 'Martynenko LS', 'Dziavgo LA']",,['rus'],"['Comparative Study', 'English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Russia (Federation),Ter Arkh,Terapevticheskii arkhiv,2984818R,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Bone Marrow Cells/pathology', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'Disease Progression', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/genetics/mortality/*pathology', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'Risk Factors', 'Survival Rate']",2005/08/25 09:00,2005/09/16 09:00,['2005/08/25 09:00'],"['2005/08/25 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/09/16 09:00 [medline]', '2005/08/25 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Ter Arkh. 2005;77(7):22-7.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

MATERIAL AND METHODS: Renal function, i.e. concentration ability, glomerularfiltration rate (GFR), concentration of electrolytes and beta2-microglobulin in blood serum and urine was studied at different stages of chemotherapy. Three cases are reported. All the patients have undergone transcutaneous fine-needle puncture biopsy of the kidney with histological and electron-microscopic study of biopsy specimens. RESULTS: Total urinalysis showed minimal changes. Concentration and filtration functions of the kidneys were impaired. Morphologically, glomerular damage was insignificant, there was dystrophy of tubular epithelium and focal interstitial sclerosis. Electron-microscopic examination revealed structural defects of the basal membrane of glomerular capillaries (focal thinning, focal insignificant thickening, the absence of three-layer structure at long distance) in all the patients. Dissection of the basal membrane was seen in one case. All the patients had cytoplasmic viruses: Epstein-Barr, cytomegalovirus, herpes simplex viruses type 1 and 2. In two cases mitochondria were affected with viruses. Dystrophic changes of podocytes and mitochondrial degradation were observed in all the cases. CONCLUSION: Chemotherapy may affect glomerular and tubular system of the kidney increasing probability of complications. Imbalance between cytolysis kinetics and natural clearance of the products of degradation of cells and drug metabolites may lead to nephropathy.

MATERIAL AND METHODS: In November 2001 Hematological Research Center (HRC) initiated the study of chimeric BCR-ABL gene. During the first stage of the study (November 2001-July 2004), 18 primary ALL patients were recruited in HRC, from July 2004 to January 2005--16 patients in HRC, N.N. Burdenko Central Military Hospital, regional Samara hospital. The diagnosis of Ph-positive ALL was established in detection of translocation t(9;22) by standard cytogenetic test or fluorescent hibridization in situ with double signal (D-FISH), or by polymerase chain reaction with reverse transcription (RT-PCR). In detection of aberration of BCR-ABL gene the patients received stem hemopoietic cells, from June 2004 imatinib was added to chemotherapy in the period of induction and consolidation. RESULTS: Incidence rate of BCR-ABL-positive ALL by standard cytogenetic test and D-FISH makes up 20%, by RT-PCR--25%. Differences in chimeric transcripts detectability by different methods may be explained by different sensitivity of the methods. Complete hematological remissions were achieved in the majority of the patients (6 of 8) irrespective of imatinib administration. Achievement of molecular remission in BCR-ABL-positive ALL occurs also in standard chemotherapy but molecular remissions begin 2-4 months later than clinicohematological ones. CONCLUSION: In using imatinib combination with chemotherapy, molecular remission can be achieved simultaneously with hematological one. Long-term results will be analysed later.","['Parovichnikova, E N', 'Savchenko, V G', 'Verniuk, M A', 'Vinogradova, O A', 'Misiurin, A V', ""Vorob'ev, I A"", 'Domracheva, E V', 'Tikhonova, L Iu', 'Rukavitsyn, O A', 'Rossiev, V A', 'Kliasova, G A', 'Turkina, A G', 'Liubimova, L S', 'Mendeleeva, L P', 'Isaev, V G']","['Parovichnikova EN', 'Savchenko VG', 'Verniuk MA', 'Vinogradova OA', 'Misiurin AV', ""Vorob'ev IA"", 'Domracheva EV', 'Tikhonova LIu', 'Rukavitsyn OA', 'Rossiev VA', 'Kliasova GA', 'Turkina AG', 'Liubimova LS', 'Mendeleeva LP', 'Isaev VG']",,['rus'],"['Comparative Study', 'English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Russia (Federation),Ter Arkh,Terapevticheskii arkhiv,2984818R,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Benzamides', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Piperazines/therapeutic use', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/*genetics/metabolism', 'Pyrimidines/therapeutic use', 'Remission Induction', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Treatment Outcome']",2005/08/25 09:00,2005/09/16 09:00,['2005/08/25 09:00'],"['2005/08/25 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/09/16 09:00 [medline]', '2005/08/25 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Ter Arkh. 2005;77(7):11-6.,,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Patients with CD33-positive AML in first recurrence were entered in 3 open-label, single-arm, Phase II studies. Patients received monotherapy with GO 9 mg/m(2) as a 2-hour intravenous infusion in 2 doses separated by 2 weeks. Patients were evaluated for remission, survival, and treatment-emergent adverse events. RESULTS: Two hundred seventy-seven patients (median age, 61 yrs) were treated with GO, and 71 patients (26%) achieved remission, which was defined as < or = 5% blasts in the bone marrow without leukemic blasts in the peripheral blood, neutrophil recovery to > or = 1500/microL, hemoglobin > or = 9 g/dL, and independence from red blood cell and platelet transfusions. Complete remission (CR) with platelet recovery (> or = 100,000/microL) or without full platelet recovery (< 100,000/microL) (CRp) was observed in 35 patients (13%) and 36 patients (13%), respectively. The median recurrence-free survival was 6.4 months for patients who achieved CR and 4.5 months for patients who achieved CRp. Although expected incidences of Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia (98%) and thrombocytopenia (99%) were observed, the incidence of Grade 3 or 4 sepsis (17%) and pneumonia (8%) was relatively low. Grade 3 or 4 hyperbilirubinemia and hepatic aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase elevations were reported in 29%, 18%, and 9% of patients, respectively; 0.9% of patients who did not undergo prior or subsequent hematopoietic stem cell transplantation developed hepatic venoocclusive disease after GO treatment.

To explore the in vivo consequences of an activating FLT3 internal tandem duplication mutation (FLT3-ITD), we created a transgenic mouse model in which FLT3-ITD was expressed under the control of the vav hematopoietic promoter. Five independent lines of vav-FLT3-ITD transgenic mice developed a myeloproliferative disease with high penetrance and a disease latency of 6-12 months. The phenotype was characterized by splenomegaly, megakaryocytic hyperplasia, and marked thrombocythemia, but without leukocytosis, polycythemia, or marrow fibrosis, displaying features reminiscent of the human disease essential thrombocythemia (ET). Clonal immature B- or T-lymphoid disease was observed in two additional founder mice, respectively, that could be secondarily transplanted to recipient mice that rapidly developed lymphoid disease. Treatment of these mice with the FLT3 tyrosine kinase inhibitor, PKC412, resulted in suppression of disease and a statistically significant prolongation of survival. These results demonstrate that FLT3-ITD is capable of inducing myeloproliferative as well as lymphoid disease, and indicate that small-molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors may be an effective treatment for lymphoid malignancies in humans that are associated with activating mutations in FLT3.","['Lee, Benjamin H', 'Williams, Ifor R', 'Anastasiadou, Ema', 'Boulton, Christina L', 'Joseph, Sarah W', 'Amaral, Sonia M', 'Curley, David P', 'Duclos, Nicole', 'Huntly, Brian J P', 'Fabbro, Doriano', 'Griffin, James D', 'Gilliland, Dwight Gary']","['Lee BH', 'Williams IR', 'Anastasiadou E', 'Boulton CL', 'Joseph SW', 'Amaral SM', 'Curley DP', 'Duclos N', 'Huntly BJ', 'Fabbro D', 'Griffin JD', 'Gilliland DG']","[""Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, MA 02115, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,IM,"['Animals', 'Disease Models, Animal', '*Gene Duplication', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*genetics/physiopathology', 'Lymphoma/*genetics/physiopathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Mutation', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/*genetics/physiopathology', 'Phenotype', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Protein Kinase C/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Staurosporine/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/*genetics/physiology']",2005/08/24 09:00,2005/12/31 09:00,['2005/08/24 09:00'],"['2005/08/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/12/31 09:00 [medline]', '2005/08/24 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2005 Nov 24;24(53):7882-92. doi: 10.1038/sj.onc.1208933.,"['5T32HL 07627-16/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA66996/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'DK50654/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States']","['EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'H88EPA0A3N (Staurosporine)', 'ID912S5VON (midostaurin)']",,"['1208933 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.onc.1208933 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Acute lymphoblastic leukemia was the most common underlying disease (71.4%) among the 91 children under study. Candida albicans was the predominant species, with 17/29 isolates (58.6%); followed by C. tropicalis, with 10/29 isolates (34.5%). The drug susceptibility data analysis for the clinical isolates of Candida revealed 17.2% (5/29) resistance to fluconazole. This study reinforces the need for the systematic surveillance of candidosis for the correct management of such life-threatening infections.","['Kumar, Chethrapilly Purushothaman Girish', 'Sundararajan, Thangavel', 'Menon, Thangam', 'Venkatadesikalu, Manjetti']","['Kumar CP', 'Sundararajan T', 'Menon T', 'Venkatadesikalu M']","['Department of Microbiology, Dr ALM Post Graduate Institute of Basic Medical Sciences, University of Madras, Chennai, India.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Japan,Jpn J Infect Dis,Japanese journal of infectious diseases,100893704,IM,"['Antifungal Agents/pharmacology', '*Candida/drug effects/isolation & purification', 'Candidiasis/*epidemiology/etiology', 'Child', 'Cohort Studies', 'Drug Resistance, Fungal', 'Female', 'Fluconazole/pharmacology', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/complications/*epidemiology', 'Humans', 'India/epidemiology', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/complications/epidemiology', 'Male', 'Prospective Studies', 'Species Specificity', 'Superinfection/*epidemiology/etiology']",2005/08/24 09:00,2005/10/21 09:00,['2005/08/24 09:00'],"['2005/08/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/10/21 09:00 [medline]', '2005/08/24 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Jpn J Infect Dis. 2005 Aug;58(4):218-21.,,"['0 (Antifungal Agents)', '8VZV102JFY (Fluconazole)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, we analyzed their expression in inflammatory and hematopoietic cells and in patients suffering from systemic mastocytosis (SM) and chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML). Normal human and monkey tissue specimens and tissues from patients suffering from SM and CML were analyzed by means of immunohistochemistry, radioactive in situ hybridization, real time RT-PCR, double fluorescence confocal laser scanning microscopy, and immunoelectron microscopy. In normal tissue specimens, VMAT2, but not VMAT1, was expressed in mast cells, megakaryocytes, thrombocytes, basophil granulocytes, and cutaneous Langerhans cells. Further hematopoietic and lymphoid cells showed no expression of VMATs. VMAT2 was expressed in all types of SM, as indicated by coexpression with the mast cell marker tryptase. In CML, VMAT2 expression was retained in neoplastic megakaryocytes and basophil granulocytes. In conclusion, the identification of VMAT2 in mast cells, megakaryocytes, thrombocytes, basophil granulocytes, and cutaneous Langerhans cells provides evidence that these cells possess molecular mechanisms for monoamine storage and handling. VMAT2 identifies normal and neoplastic mast cells, megakaryocytes, and basophil granulocytes and may therefore become a valuable tool for the diagnosis of mastocytosis and malignant systemic diseases involving megakaryocytes and basophil granulocytes.","['Anlauf, Martin', 'Schafer, Martin K-H', 'Schwark, Thorsten', 'von Wurmb-Schwark, Nicole', 'Brand, Viktoria', 'Sipos, Bence', 'Horny, Hans-Peter', 'Parwaresch, Reza', 'Hartschuh, Wolfgang', 'Eiden, Lee E', 'Kloppel, Gunter', 'Weihe, Eberhard']","['Anlauf M', 'Schafer MK', 'Schwark T', 'von Wurmb-Schwark N', 'Brand V', 'Sipos B', 'Horny HP', 'Parwaresch R', 'Hartschuh W', 'Eiden LE', 'Kloppel G', 'Weihe E']","['Department of Pathology, University of Kiel, Michaelisstr. 11, 24105 Kiel, Germany. manlauf@path.uni-kiel.de']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Histochem Cytochem,The journal of histochemistry and cytochemistry : official journal of the Histochemistry Society,9815334,IM,"['Animals', 'Basophils/metabolism', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/biosynthesis', 'Blood Platelets/metabolism', 'Bone Marrow Cells/*metabolism', '*Hematopoiesis', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'In Situ Hybridization', 'Langerhans Cells/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/blood/*metabolism/pathology', 'Macaca mulatta', 'Mast Cells/metabolism', 'Mastocytosis, Systemic/blood/*metabolism/pathology', 'Megakaryocytes/metabolism', 'Microscopy, Confocal', 'Microscopy, Immunoelectron', 'Organ Specificity', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Vesicular Monoamine Transport Proteins/*biosynthesis/genetics']",2005/08/24 09:00,2006/03/08 09:00,['2005/08/24 09:00'],"['2005/08/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/03/08 09:00 [medline]', '2005/08/24 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Histochem Cytochem. 2006 Feb;54(2):201-13. doi: 10.1369/jhc.5A6739.2005.

For its antileukemic effect, glucocorticoid binds the intracellular glucocorticoid receptor (GR) subsequently regulating transcription of downstream genes. We analyzed whether genetic variations within the GR gene are related to differences in the cellular response to glucocorticoids. METHODS: In leukemic samples of 57 children, the GR gene was screened for nucleotide variations using a PCR/single-strand conformational polymorphism sequencing strategy. Data were linked to in vivo and in vitro glucocorticoid resistance. RESULTS: No somatic mutations were detected in the GR gene coding region, but six polymorphisms (i.e., ER22/23EK, N363S, BclI, intron mutation 16 bp upstream of exon 5, H588H, and N766N) were identified. In 67% of ALL cases, at least one minor allele of these polymorphisms was detected. Although only borderline significant, the incidence for the N363S polymorphism minor allele was higher (12% versus 6%, P = 0.06) and for the ER22/23EK minor allele lower (4% versus 7.6%, P = 0.1) than in a healthy, comparable population. The different genotypes of the polymorphisms were not related to prednisone resistance. In conclusion, polymorphisms but not somatic mutations in the GR gene coding region occur in leukemic blasts of children with ALL. Our data suggest that these genetic variations are not a major contributor for differences in cellular response to glucocorticoids in childhood ALL. The higher incidence of the N363S minor allele and the lower incidence of the ER22/23EK minor allele in our ALL population as compared with a normal population warrants further research.","['Tissing, Wim J E', 'Meijerink, Jules P P', 'den Boer, Monique L', 'Brinkhof, Bas', 'van Rossum, Elisabeth F C', 'van Wering, Elisabeth R', 'Koper, Jan W', 'Sonneveld, Pieter', 'Pieters, Rob']","['Tissing WJ', 'Meijerink JP', 'den Boer ML', 'Brinkhof B', 'van Rossum EF', 'van Wering ER', 'Koper JW', 'Sonneveld P', 'Pieters R']","[""Department of Pediatric Oncology/Hematology, Erasmus Medical Center/Sophia Children's Hospital, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Cell Survival/drug effects/genetics', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', 'DNA, Neoplasm/chemistry/genetics', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*genetics', 'Female', '*Genetic Variation', 'Genotype', 'Glucocorticoids/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Male', 'Mutation', 'Polymorphism, Genetic', 'Polymorphism, Single-Stranded Conformational', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/*genetics/pathology', 'Prednisolone/pharmacology', 'Receptors, Glucocorticoid/*genetics', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2005/08/24 09:00,2005/12/22 09:00,['2005/08/24 09:00'],"['2005/08/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/12/22 09:00 [medline]', '2005/08/24 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2005 Aug 15;11(16):6050-6. doi: 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-04-2097.,,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Glucocorticoids)', '0 (Receptors, Glucocorticoid)', '9PHQ9Y1OLM (Prednisolone)']",,"['11/16/6050 [pii]', '10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-04-2097 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We studied the pharmacokinetics and cerebrospinal fluid penetration of clofarabine in a nonhuman primate model. METHODS: A dose of 2.3 mg/kg of clofarabine was given i.v. over 2 hours to each of four animals. Plasma and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples were obtained at specified intervals and the clofarabine concentration determined by reverse-phase high-pressure liquid chromatography with mass spectroscopy. RESULTS: The median clofarabine clearance was 17 mL/min/kg (range, 15-20), the median plasma area under the concentration-time curve was 452 mumol/L minutes (range, 380-487), and the median terminal half-life was 105 minutes (range, 78-138). Concentrations of clofarabine in CSF could not be modeled reliably because the terminal rate constant was not well defined. The median CSF penetration was 5% (range, 3-26%). CONCLUSION: Clofarabine penetrates into the CSF only modestly, but the concentrations obtained may approach those that are cytotoxic in vitro. Evaluation of the contribution of clofarabine to central nervous system preventive therapy should be considered in future studies.","['Berg, Stacey L', 'Bonate, Peter L', 'Nuchtern, Jed G', 'Dauser, Robert', 'McGuffey, Leticia', 'Bernacky, Bruce', 'Blaney, Susan M']","['Berg SL', 'Bonate PL', 'Nuchtern JG', 'Dauser R', 'McGuffey L', 'Bernacky B', 'Blaney SM']","[""Texas Children's Cancer Center, Department of Surgery, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas 77030, USA. sberg@txcc.org""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,IM,"['Adenine Nucleotides', 'Animals', 'Arabinonucleosides/blood/cerebrospinal fluid/*pharmacokinetics', 'Area Under Curve', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid/methods', 'Clofarabine', 'Infusions, Intravenous', 'Macaca mulatta', 'Mass Spectrometry', 'Metabolic Clearance Rate']",2005/08/24 09:00,2005/12/22 09:00,['2005/08/24 09:00'],"['2005/08/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/12/22 09:00 [medline]', '2005/08/24 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2005 Aug 15;11(16):5981-3. doi: 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-05-0261.,,"['0 (Adenine Nucleotides)', '0 (Arabinonucleosides)', '762RDY0Y2H (Clofarabine)']",,"['11/16/5981 [pii]', '10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-05-0261 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study attempted to find the link between HBV DNA, the adjoining cellular sequence, and altered gene expression in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) with integrated HBV DNA. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We examined 15 cases of HCC infected with HBV by cassette ligation-mediated PCR. The human DNA adjacent to the integrated HBV DNA was sequenced. Protein coding sequences were searched for in the human sequence. In five cases with HBV DNA integration, from which good quality RNA was extracted, gene expression was examined by cDNA microarray analysis. RESULTS: The human DNA sequence successive to integrated HBV DNA was determined in the 15 HCCs. Eight protein-coding regions were involved: ras-responsive element binding protein 1, calmodulin 1, mixed lineage leukemia 2 (MLL2), FLJ333655, LOC220272, LOC255345, LOC220220, and LOC168991. The MLL2 gene was expressed in three cases with HBV DNA integrated into exon 3 of MLL2 and in one case with HBV DNA integrated into intron 3 of MLL2. Gene expression analysis suggested that two HCCs with HBV integrated into MLL2 had similar patterns of gene expression compared with three HCCs with HBV integrated into other loci of human chromosomes. CONCLUSIONS: HBV DNA was integrated at random sites of human DNA, and the MLL2 gene was one of the targets for integration. Our results suggest that HBV DNA might modulate human genes near integration sites, followed by integration site-specific expression of such genes during hepatocarcinogenesis.","['Tamori, Akihiro', 'Yamanishi, Yoshihiro', 'Kawashima, Shuichi', 'Kanehisa, Minoru', 'Enomoto, Masaru', 'Tanaka, Hiromu', 'Kubo, Shoji', 'Shiomi, Susumu', 'Nishiguchi, Shuhei']","['Tamori A', 'Yamanishi Y', 'Kawashima S', 'Kanehisa M', 'Enomoto M', 'Tanaka H', 'Kubo S', 'Shiomi S', 'Nishiguchi S']","['Department of Hepatology, Osaka City University Graduate School of Medicine, Osaka, Japan. atamori@med.osaka-cu.ac.jp']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Base Sequence', 'Carcinoma, Hepatocellular/*genetics/virology', 'DNA, Neoplasm/chemistry/genetics', 'DNA, Viral/chemistry/*genetics', 'Exons/genetics', 'Female', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Hepatitis B/genetics/virology', 'Hepatitis B virus/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Kidney Neoplasms/*genetics/virology', 'MAP Kinase Kinase Kinases/genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction/methods', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA', 'Virus Integration/genetics']",2005/08/24 09:00,2005/12/22 09:00,['2005/08/24 09:00'],"['2005/08/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/12/22 09:00 [medline]', '2005/08/24 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2005 Aug 15;11(16):5821-6. doi: 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-04-2055.,,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', 'EC 2.7.11.25 (MAP Kinase Kinase Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.25 (MAP3K10 protein, human)']",,"['11/16/5821 [pii]', '10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-04-2055 [doi]']",,,,,,,"['Clin Cancer Res. 2006 Jun 1;12(11 Pt 1):3549; author reply 3549-50.

Their roles in the progression of human cancers, however, are not well established. The aim of this study was to examine whether leukemic cells of acute myeloid leukemia express functional B7 family molecules and, if so, whether such expression has any clinical significance. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: The expression of four B7 family molecules, B7.1, B7.2, B7-H1, and B7-H2, on leukemic cells from acute myeloid leukemia patients was analyzed by flow cytometry. The function of the expressed molecules was examined by the allogeneic mixed lymphocyte-leukemic cell reaction, and their relationship to the clinical data and survival was analyzed. RESULTS: Although B7.1 and B7-H1 expressions were rare, the cells from a substantial number of acute myeloid leukemia cases expressed B7.2 and B7-H2 molecules [mean percentages of B7.2- and B7-H2-positive cells were 28.9% (n = 58) and 15.3% (n = 59), respectively]. Patients in whom >25% of leukemic cells expressed B7-H2 had significantly shorter survival, and this B7-H2 positivity had the strongest prognostic value when B7-H2 and other prognostic factors were analyzed together by multivariate analysis (P = 0.0108). Furthermore, B7.2 expression was associated with hyperleukocytosis (P = 0.026). Consistent with this finding, acute myeloid leukemia cells expressing B7.2 and B7-H2 induced allogeneic CD4+ T cells to proliferate and secrete interleukin-4 and interleukin-10 in vitro, effects that were partially blocked by antibodies against B7.2 and B7-H2. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate the expression of functional B7.2 and B7-H2 molecules, and these molecules may facilitate progression of acute myeloid leukemia.","['Tamura, Hideto', 'Dan, Kazuo', 'Tamada, Koji', 'Nakamura, Kyoko', 'Shioi, Yumiko', 'Hyodo, Hideya', 'Wang, Sheng-Dian', 'Dong, Haidong', 'Chen, Lieping', 'Ogata, Kiyoyuki']","['Tamura H', 'Dan K', 'Tamada K', 'Nakamura K', 'Shioi Y', 'Hyodo H', 'Wang SD', 'Dong H', 'Chen L', 'Ogata K']","['Third Department of Internal Medicine, Nippon Medical School, Tokyo, Japan. tam@nms.ac.jp']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Analysis of Variance', 'Antigens, CD', 'B7-2 Antigen/analysis/*genetics', 'Bone Marrow Cells/metabolism/pathology', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/cytology/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Culture Media, Conditioned/chemistry/metabolism', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Inducible T-Cell Co-Stimulator Ligand', 'Interferon-gamma/metabolism', 'Interleukin-10/metabolism', 'Interleukin-2/metabolism', 'Interleukin-4/metabolism', 'Jurkat Cells', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/genetics/metabolism/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', 'Proteins/analysis/*genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Survival Analysis', 'U937 Cells']",2005/08/24 09:00,2005/12/22 09:00,['2005/08/24 09:00'],"['2005/08/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/12/22 09:00 [medline]', '2005/08/24 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2005 Aug 15;11(16):5708-17. doi: 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-04-2672.,,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (B7-2 Antigen)', '0 (CD86 protein, human)', '0 (Culture Media, Conditioned)', '0 (ICOSLG protein, human)', '0 (Inducible T-Cell Co-Stimulator Ligand)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '130068-27-8 (Interleukin-10)', '207137-56-2 (Interleukin-4)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)']",,"['11/16/5708 [pii]', '10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-04-2672 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

At the cellular level, FA is characterized by hypersensitivity to DNA cross-linking agents and by high frequencies of induced chromosomal aberrations, a property used for diagnosis. FA results from mutations in one of the eleven FANC (FANCA to FANCJ) genes. Nine of them have been identified. In addition, FANCD1 gene has been shown to be identical to BRCA2, one of the two breast cancer susceptibility genes. Seven of the FANC proteins form a complex, which exists in four different forms depending of its subcellular localisation. Four FANC proteins (D1(BRCA2), D2, I and J) are not associated to the complex. The presence of the nuclear form of the FA core complex is necessary for the mono-ubiquitinylation of FANCD2 protein, a modification required for its re-localization to nuclear foci, likely to be sites of DNA repair. A clue towards understanding the molecular function of the FANC genes comes from the recently identified connection of FANC to the BRCA1, ATM, NBS1 and ATR genes. Two of the FANC proteins (A and D2) directly interact with BRCA1, which in turn interacts with the MRE11/RAD50/NBS1 complex, which is one of the key components in the mechanisms involved in the cellular response to DNA double strand breaks (DSB). Moreover, ATM, a protein kinase that plays a central role in the network of DSB signalling, phosphorylates in vitro and in vivo FANCD2 in response to ionising radiations. Moreover, the NBS1 protein and the monoubiquitinated form of FANCD2 seem to act together in response to DNA crosslinking agents. Taken together with the previously reported impaired DSB and DNA interstrand crosslinks repair in FA cells, the connection of FANC genes to the ATM, ATR, NBS1 and BRCA1 links the FANC genes function to the finely orchestrated network involved in the sensing, signalling and repair of DNA replication-blocking lesions.","['Papadopoulo, Dora', 'Moustacchi, Ethel']","['Papadopoulo D', 'Moustacchi E']","[""Institut Curie, Section de recherche, UMR 218 CNRS, 26 rue d'Ulm, 75248 Paris Cedex 05, France.

METHODS: After incubation for 5 h with 0.5 mumol/L ZnPcS2P2, the HL60 cells were exposed to a light source of 670 nm wavelength. Thereafter, the cells were detected at different time intervals after PDT. The characteristics of apoptosis were detected by observation of ultrastructure assay, DNA fragmentation assay and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase deoxyuridine nick-end labeling method (TUNEL). Mitochondria-dependent apoptosis was determined by the detection of mitochondrial membrane potential (deltaPhim), activities of caspase family protease and of caspase-3, cytosol cytochrome c. Proteins Bcl-2 and Bax were detected by immunoblot analysis. RESULTS: Evident characteristics of apoptosis were observed post-ZnPc-PDT with ultrastructure assay, DNA fragmentation assay and TUNEL staining. TUNEL assay showed that apoptotic rates in the cells collected from 6 h, 12 h and 24 h after PDT were 9.6%, 24.4%, and 33.0%, respectively. HL60 cells underwent mitochondria-dependent apoptosis as a result of cytochrome c release from mitochondria into cytosol accompanied by a reduction of deltaPhim. The activities of caspase family protease and of caspase-3 were elevated. Furthermore, ZnPc-PDT could remarkably down-regulate the Bcl-2 pro-apoptotic protein and up-regulate the anti-apoptotic Bax protein. CONCLUSION: ZnPc-PDT could induce mitochondria-dependent apoptosis in HL60 cells.","['Huang, Hui-fang', 'Chen, Yuan-zhong', 'Wu, Yong']","['Huang HF', 'Chen YZ', 'Wu Y']","['Fujian Institute of Hematology, Union Hospital, Fujian Medical University, Fuzhou 350001, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Acta Pharmacol Sin,Acta pharmacologica Sinica,100956087,IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Caspase 3', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Cytochromes c/*metabolism', 'Cytosol/metabolism', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Indoles/*pharmacology', 'Light', 'Mitochondria/*metabolism', 'Organometallic Compounds/*pharmacology', '*Photochemotherapy', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'Zinc/pharmacology', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein/metabolism']",2005/08/24 09:00,2006/11/01 09:00,['2005/08/24 09:00'],"['2005/08/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/11/01 09:00 [medline]', '2005/08/24 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Acta Pharmacol Sin. 2005 Sep;26(9):1138-44. doi: 10.1111/j.1745-7254.2005.00160.x.,,"['0 (Indoles)', '0 (Organometallic Compounds)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', '61569-01-5 (zinc phthalocyanine disulfonate)', '9007-43-6 (Cytochromes c)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'J41CSQ7QDS (Zinc)']",,['10.1111/j.1745-7254.2005.00160.x [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have investigated the effect of modulating this signalling pathway on the sensitivity of leukaemic cell lines (NB-4, CEM, Jurkat, MOLT-4) and acute promyelocytic primary blasts to apoptosis induced by 1 micromol/l As2O3. Whereas parental NB-4 cells did not display any phosphorylated (active) Akt, CEM, Jurkat and MOLT-4 cells exhibited high levels of Akt activation. Consistently, treatment of NB-4 cells with pharmacological inhibitors of the PI3K/Akt pathway (LY294002, wortmannin) did not increase sensitivity of these cells to arsenic trioxide (As2O3), whereas siRNA knock-down of Akt enhanced As2O3-induced apoptosis of CEM, Jurkat and MOLT-4 cells. Overexpression of a constitutively active Akt cDNA rendered NB-4 cells less susceptible to As2O3. Upon prolonged exposure to As2O3, we isolated a NB-4 cell clone that was resistant to As2O3 and displayed high levels of active Akt. LY294002 treatment of acute promyelocytic primary blasts with elevated Akt phosphorylation levels resulted in an increased sensitivity to As2O3.

When indirubin was present during the neutrophilic differentiation of human myelocytic leukaemia HL-60 cells, it augmented superoxide production triggered by opsonized zymosan (OZ) by the terminally differentiated HL-60 cells. It also augmented the calcium response to OZ stimulation, and HL-60 cell chemotaxis evoked by interleukin-8 (IL-8, CXCL8) and formylpeptide. In addition, indirubin induced marked IL-8 release by the cells during differentiation and the cells differentiated with indirubin had typical neutrophilic properties, deformed nuclei and granules. Use of stable cloned HL-60 cells that contained a reporter vector for monitoring the activity of the transcription factor PU.1, which acts specifically at the stage of promyelocyte differentiation into neutrophils and monocytes, revealed that indirubin has a potent promoting activity on intracellular PU.1. Indirubin enhanced the expression of typical neutrophil proteins, including granulocyte-colony stimulating factor receptor, the beta2-integrin subunit CD18, the NADPH-oxidase subunit p47phox, and the IL-8 receptor CXCR1, all are controlled by PU.1. Indirubin also inhibited CDK2-dependent phosphorylation of retinoblastoma protein during neutrophilic differentiation. These results suggest that indirubin augments the neutrophilic differentiation of human myelocytic leukaemia HL-60 cells through inhibition of CDK2 and activation of PU.1.","['Suzuki, Kazuhiro', 'Adachi, Reiko', 'Hirayama, Akiko', 'Watanabe, Hidemi', 'Otani, Saki', 'Watanabe, Yuka', 'Kasahara, Tadashi']","['Suzuki K', 'Adachi R', 'Hirayama A', 'Watanabe H', 'Otani S', 'Watanabe Y', 'Kasahara T']","['National Institute of Health Sciences, Tokyo, Japan. ksuzuki@nihs.go.jp']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,IM,"['CD18 Antigens/metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Chemotaxis', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Dimethyl Sulfoxide/pharmacology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/pharmacology', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Image Processing, Computer-Assisted', 'Immunoblotting', 'Indoles/pharmacology', 'Interleukin-8/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*pathology', 'N-Formylmethionine Leucyl-Phenylalanine/pharmacology', 'Neutrophils/*drug effects', 'Phosphorylation', 'Receptors, Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/metabolism', 'Receptors, Interleukin-8A/metabolism', 'Retinoblastoma Protein/metabolism', 'Stimulation, Chemical', 'Superoxides/metabolism']",2005/08/24 09:00,2005/10/28 09:00,['2005/08/24 09:00'],"['2005/08/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/10/28 09:00 [medline]', '2005/08/24 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2005 Sep;130(5):681-90. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.2005.05655.x.,,"['0 (CD18 Antigens)', '0 (Indoles)', '0 (Interleukin-8)', '0 (Receptors, Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-8A)', '0 (Retinoblastoma Protein)', '11062-77-4 (Superoxides)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '59880-97-6 (N-Formylmethionine Leucyl-Phenylalanine)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinases)', 'V86L8P74GI (indirubin)', 'YOW8V9698H (Dimethyl Sulfoxide)']",,"['BJH5655 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1365-2141.2005.05655.x [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, non-neoplastic skin diseases may be associated with recruitment of normal and neoplastic leukocytes circulating in the peripheral blood. In those instances, neoplastic cells may be detected in skin lesions without an adverse effect on prognosis. METHODS: In a patient with B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia, a specific infiltrate developed at the site of a florid herpes simplex infection. Clinically, the lesion presented itself as an ulcerated tumor. RESULTS: Histopathologically, the lesion was characterized by a dense, diffuse infiltrate of small hyperchromatic lymphocytes throughout the entire dermis. Lymphocytes showed an aberrant CD20(+)/CD43(+)/CD5(+) phenotype of neoplastic B cells, and monoclonal rearrangement of immunoglobulin gamma genes could be demonstrated by polymerase chain reaction. Although criteria for leukemia cutis were fulfilled, the patient did well. CONCLUSIONS: The cutaneous infiltrate of neoplastic cells seemed to be part of a physiologic response to the antigenic stimulus, rather than indicating an exacerbation of leukemia.

We report here that undifferentiated HL-60 cells possess NADPH oxidase and that generation of superoxide can be measured using a highly sensitive chemiluminescence dye, L-012. Five subunits of NADPH oxidase, namely, gp91(phox), p22(phox), p67(phox), p47(phox), and Rac 2, were detected in undifferentiated HL-60 cells by immunoblotting analysis. The contents of these NADPH oxidase components in the cells were increased with the differentiation induced by phorbol myristate acetate (PMA), except for p22(phox). Messenger RNAs of these subunits were also detected by the RT-PCR method, and their expressions increased except that of p22(phox) with the differentiation induced by PMA. Kinetic analysis using L-012 revealed that HL-60 cells generated substantial amounts of ROS by various stimulants, including formylmethionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine, PMA, myristic acid, and a Ca2+ ionophore, A23187. Both diphenyleneiodonium (an inhibitor of FAD-dependent oxidase) and apocynin (a specific inhibitor of NADPH oxidase) suppressed this stimuli-dependent ROS generation. Genistein, staurosporine, uric acid, and sodium azide inhibited the ROS generation in undifferentiated HL-60 cells in a similar way to that in undifferentiated neutrophils. These results suggested that the mechanism of ROS generation in undifferentiated HL-60 cells is the same as that in primed neutrophils.","['Muranaka, Shikibu', 'Fujita, Hirofumi', 'Fujiwara, Takuzo', 'Ogino, Tetsuya', 'Sato, Eisuke F', 'Akiyama, Jitsuo', 'Imada, Isuke', 'Inoue, Masayasu', 'Utsumi, Kozo']","['Muranaka S', 'Fujita H', 'Fujiwara T', 'Ogino T', 'Sato EF', 'Akiyama J', 'Imada I', 'Inoue M', 'Utsumi K']","['Institute of Medical Science, Kurashiki Medical Center, Kurashiki, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Antioxid Redox Signal,Antioxidants & redox signaling,100888899,IM,"['Acetophenones/pharmacology', 'Amines/pharmacology', 'Antioxidants/pharmacology', 'Blotting, Western', 'Calcimycin/pharmacology', 'Catalase/metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Line', 'Genistein/pharmacology', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Hydrocarbons', 'Immunoblotting', 'Ionophores/pharmacology', 'Luminol/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/metabolism', 'Membrane Transport Proteins/metabolism', 'Myristic Acid/pharmacology', 'N-Formylmethionine Leucyl-Phenylalanine/pharmacology', 'NADPH Oxidase 2', 'NADPH Oxidases/metabolism', 'Neutrophils/metabolism', 'Onium Compounds/pharmacology', 'Phosphoproteins/metabolism', '*Reactive Oxygen Species', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Time Factors', 'rac GTP-Binding Proteins/metabolism']",2005/08/24 09:00,2006/01/05 09:00,['2005/08/24 09:00'],"['2005/08/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/01/05 09:00 [medline]', '2005/08/24 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Antioxid Redox Signal. 2005 Sep-Oct;7(9-10):1367-76. doi: 10.1089/ars.2005.7.1367.,,"['0 (Acetophenones)', '0 (Amines)', '0 (Antioxidants)', '0 (Hydrocarbons)', '0 (Ionophores)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Membrane Transport Proteins)', '0 (Onium Compounds)', '0 (Phosphoproteins)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '0 (neutrophil cytosol factor 67K)', '0I3V7S25AW (Myristic Acid)', '143323-55-1 (L 012)', '37H9VM9WZL (Calcimycin)', '59880-97-6 (N-Formylmethionine Leucyl-Phenylalanine)', '5EXP385Q4F (Luminol)', '6HJ411TU98 (diphenyleneiodonium)', 'B6J7B9UDTR (acetovanillone)', 'DH2M523P0H (Genistein)', 'EC 1.11.1.6 (Catalase)', 'EC 1.6.3.- (CYBB protein, human)', 'EC 1.6.3.- (NADPH Oxidase 2)', 'EC 1.6.3.- (NADPH Oxidases)', 'EC 1.6.3.1 (CYBA protein, human)', 'EC 1.6.3.1 (neutrophil cytosolic factor 1)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (rac2 GTP-binding protein)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (rac GTP-Binding Proteins)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)', 'O2H0Q02M4P (hexadecylamine)']",,['10.1089/ars.2005.7.1367 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Not only can we now measure circulating levels of the members of this axis in order to address the possibly pathophysiological changes, but genetic alterations can now be identified as the underlying cause of specific clinical situations. In normal children, circulating levels of IGF-I and the IGF binding proteins (IGFBPs) change throughout development and in some cases are gender dependent. Children and adolescents with a variety of illnesses and metabolic disorders have altered circulating IGF-I and IGFBP levels. Hence, in children or adolescents with exogenous obesity, anorexia nervosa, coeliac disease, leukaemia and other types of cancer, as well as in cases of GH deficiency, this axis can be altered. These data may help us to understand the physiology and pathophysiology of this system, but the clinical or diagnostic utility of these measurements is still largely debated. Indeed, in most of the above mentioned illnesses, circulating IGF and IGFBP levels overlap with normal values. Furthermore, these measurements do not provide data concerning levels of these factors at target tissues or of local synthesis and autocrine-paracrine effects. However, measurements of IGF-I and its binding proteins, as well as GH and its binding proteins, can help us to focus our analysis of patients suspected to have genetic abnormalities on the GH receptor, IGF-I, its receptor, IGFALS, or intracellular signalling proteins such as STAT5b or ERK. Possibly, the most clear clinical utility of circulating IGF-I measurements in children is in cases of GH deficiency or insensitivity or under GH treatment. However, the fact there are cases of children with non-detectable levels of circulating IGF-I that yet normal height and growth velocity, or with non-detectable levels of GH yet normal growth and IGF-I levels, raises many questions. Furthermore, circulating IGF-I levels may be within the normal control levels and the child may have a pathological growth pattern. Hence, just how useful are these measurements? Another clinically important question pertains to GH treatment in patients, such as in the Turner Syndrome, where supraphysiological levels of serum IGF-I are reached in order to induce growth. The interpretation and clinical utility of measurements of circulating IGF-I and its BPs are currently being widely discussed. As our knowledge of this system increases, with the identification of new members of this family and its intracellular mechanisms of action, as well as new genetic alterations in patients, the interpretation of laboratory results will also improve and help to better our diagnostic capability.","['Pozo, J', 'Martos-Moreno, G A', 'Barrios, V', 'Argente, J']","['Pozo J', 'Martos-Moreno GA', 'Barrios V', 'Argente J']","['Department of Pediatric Endocrinology, Universitad Autonoma de Madrid, Madrid, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",Italy,J Endocrinol Invest,Journal of endocrinological investigation,7806594,IM,"['Child', 'Child Development/*physiology', 'Growth Disorders/*physiopathology', 'Humans', 'Insulin-Like Growth Factor Binding Proteins/*physiology', 'Insulin-Like Growth Factor I/*physiology']",2005/08/24 09:00,2005/11/12 09:00,['2005/08/24 09:00'],"['2005/08/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/11/12 09:00 [medline]', '2005/08/24 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Endocrinol Invest. 2005;28(5 Suppl):38-42.,,"['0 (Insulin-Like Growth Factor Binding Proteins)', '67763-96-6 (Insulin-Like Growth Factor I)']",26,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Eleven-nineteen Lysine-rich Leukemia (ELL) is an RNA polymerase II transcription elongation factor, initially identified as a fusion partner gene of MLL in the t(11; 19) (q23; p13.1) chromosomal translocation in acute myeloid leukemia. U19/Eaf2 was previously reported as an ELL-associated factor, a potential transcription factor binds to ELL, forming nuclear speckles in vivo. These findings suggest that ELL-U19/Eaf2 interaction is potentially important in prostate cancer progression and/or acute myeloid leukemia. However, the functional significance of U19/Eaf2 interaction with ELL remains unclear. METHODS: Using co-transfection, co-immunoprecipitation, protein stability assay and transactivation assay, we characterized the consequence of ELL binding to U19/Eaf2. RESULTS: We provide further evidence for U19/Eaf2 as a transcription factor and show that ELL binding is required for nuclear speckle formation of human U19/Eaf2, stabilizes U19/Eaf2 and enhances its transactivation activity. CONCLUSIONS: The above observations indicate ELL may be an important factor required for U19/Eaf2 function because U19/Eaf2 nuclear localization and transactivation activity are essential for its function as a transcription factor.","['Xiao, Wuhan', 'Jiang, Feng', 'Wang, Zhou']","['Xiao W', 'Jiang F', 'Wang Z']","['Department of Urology, Robert H.

The aim of our study was to investigate the presence of both a B and cytotoxic T cell (CTL) response to ALK in ALK-positive ALCL. We confirmed the presence of an antibody response to ALK in all 9 ALK-positive ALCL patients investigated. An ELISpot assay was used to detect a gamma-interferon (IFN) T cell response after short term culture of mononuclear blood cells with 2 ALK-derived HLA-A*0201 restricted peptides: ALKa and ALKb. A significant gamma-IFN response was identified in all 7 HLA-A*0201-positive ALK-positive ALCL patients but not in ALK-negative ALCL patients (n = 2) or normal subjects (n = 6). CTL lines (>95% CD8-positive) raised from 2 ALK-positive ALCL patients lysed ALK-positive ALCL derived cell lines in a MHC-Class I restricted manner. This is the first report of both a B cell and CTL response to ALK in patients with ALK-positive ALCL. This response persisted during long-term remission. The use of modified vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA) to express ALK is also described. Our findings are of potential prognostic value and open up therapeutic options for those ALK-positive patients who do not respond to conventional treatment.","['Ait-Tahar, Kamel', 'Cerundolo, Vincenzo', 'Banham, Alison H', 'Hatton, Christian', 'Blanchard, Tom', 'Kusec, Rajko', 'Becker, Marion', 'Smith, Geoffrey L', 'Pulford, Karen']","['Ait-Tahar K', 'Cerundolo V', 'Banham AH', 'Hatton C', 'Blanchard T', 'Kusec R', 'Becker M', 'Smith GL', 'Pulford K']","['Nuffield Department of Clinical Laboratory Sciences, Leukaemia Research Fund Immunodiagnostics Unit, John Radcliffe Hospital, Oxford, United Kingdom. karen.pulford@ndcls.ox.ac.uk']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Anaplastic Lymphoma Kinase', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Epitopes, B-Lymphocyte/*immunology', 'Epitopes, T-Lymphocyte/*immunology', 'Female', 'HLA-A Antigens/immunology/metabolism', 'HLA-A2 Antigen', 'Humans', 'Interferon-gamma/metabolism', 'Lymphoma, Large-Cell, Anaplastic/*immunology/metabolism', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Peptide Fragments/immunology/metabolism', 'Prognosis', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*immunology/*metabolism', 'Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/*immunology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Vaccinia virus/genetics/immunology']",2005/08/23 09:00,2006/02/08 09:00,['2005/08/23 09:00'],"['2005/08/23 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/02/08 09:00 [medline]', '2005/08/23 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Int J Cancer. 2006 Feb 1;118(3):688-95. doi: 10.1002/ijc.21410.,,"['0 (Epitopes, B-Lymphocyte)', '0 (Epitopes, T-Lymphocyte)', '0 (HLA-A Antigens)', '0 (HLA-A*02:01 antigen)', '0 (HLA-A2 Antigen)', '0 (Peptide Fragments)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (ALK protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Anaplastic Lymphoma Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)']",,['10.1002/ijc.21410 [doi]'],,"['Copyright 2005 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To examine whether dendritic cells (DCs) generated from CLL patients can be candidates for immune therapy, we compared the phenotypic and functional capacities of DCs generated from patients of the 2 CLL subgroups (normal age-matched subjects [normal-DCs]). Our data show that immature DCs from B-CLL patients (B-CLL-DCs) have the same capacity to take up antigen as those from normal controls. Furthermore, B-CLL-DCs generated from the 2 CLL subgroups up-regulated MHC-II, CD80, CD86, CD83, CD40, and CD54 and down-regulated CD206 in response to stimulation with a cocktail of cytokines (CyC) and secreted increased levels of tumor necrosis factor alpha, interleukin (IL)-8, IL-6, IL-12 (p70), and RANTES in a manner typical of mature normal-DCs. Interestingly, CD54 was significantly more up-regulated by CyC in B-CLL-DCs compared with normal-DCs. Except for CD54, no significant differences in surface molecule expression were observed between normal-DCs and B-CLL-DCs. B-CLL-DCs from both subgroups, including 6 patients with VH1-69, that usually fare poorly, presented tetanus toxoid to autologous T cells in vitro similar to normal- DCs. Our data show that DCs generated from the B-CLL subgroup with unmutated Ig V genes are functionally normal.

Myeloblastic and a monoblastic cell lines were cultured and investigated for lineage specific maturation markers and FXIII-A expression. Furthermore, FXIII-A expression was investigated in 12 normal samples (7 bone marrow and 5 peripheral blood), 86 de novo AML samples and 6 chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) samples. In the monoblastic MonoMac6 cell line the appearance of FXIII-A preceded that of CD14 while it remained negative in the myeloblastic PLB-985 cell line throughout its maturation period. Among the AML samples the average frequency of FXIII-A positive cells in myeloblastic leukemia samples was below 10%, while in M4 and M5AML samples it was above 50% and was significantly higher than the generally used CD14 marker (p < 0.0001). In the AML M4 and M5 cases, FXIII-A proved sensitive for the identification of monoblasts. FXIII-A can be considered as a reliable intracytoplasmic marker for the monocytic and megakaryocytic series and its presence is highly predictive for mono- and megakaryocytic AML and for CMML.","['Kappelmayer, Janos', 'Simon, Agnes', 'Katona, Eva', 'Szanto, Attila', 'Nagy, Laszlo', 'Kiss, Attila', 'Kiss, Csongor', 'Muszbek, Laszlo']","['Kappelmayer J', 'Simon A', 'Katona E', 'Szanto A', 'Nagy L', 'Kiss A', 'Kiss C', 'Muszbek L']","['Department of Clinical Biochemistry and Molecular Pathology, Medical and Health Science Centre, University of Debrecen, Hungary. kappelmayer@dote.hu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Thromb Haemost,Thrombosis and haemostasis,7608063,IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Lineage', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cytoplasm/metabolism', 'Factor XIIIa/*metabolism/*physiology', 'Flow Cytometry/*methods', 'Granulocytes/cytology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/classification/*metabolism', 'Leukocytes/metabolism', 'Lipopolysaccharide Receptors/biosynthesis', 'Megakaryocytes/cytology', 'Monocytes/cytology/metabolism', 'Myeloid Cells/cytology', 'Sensitivity and Specificity']",2005/08/23 09:00,2005/12/22 09:00,['2005/08/23 09:00'],"['2005/08/23 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/12/22 09:00 [medline]', '2005/08/23 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Thromb Haemost. 2005 Aug;94(2):454-9. doi: 10.1160/TH05-03-0206.,,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Lipopolysaccharide Receptors)', 'EC 2.3.2.13 (Factor XIIIa)']",,"['05080454 [pii]', '10.1160/TH05-03-0206 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Viral pathogens may directly or indirectly impact upon transplant-related mortality. Rotavirus is one of the most common causes of diarrhoea worldwide, but one of the least studied causes of diarrhoea post SCT. In this retrospective study we describe 21 cases of confirmed rotavirus infection in allogeneic SCT recipients. Most of these cases may occur in clusters during the winter and spring period. Symptoms of rotaviral infection were diarrhoea (95%), vomiting (62%), abdominal pain (38%), weight loss and loss of appetite in 38 and 29% of the cases, respectively. Possible extraintestinal manifestations of rotavirus infection were observed. The duration of the symptoms in this series ranged from 4 days to 4 months with median of 15 days. Patients with rotavirus infection were invariably lymphopenic and/or on immunosuppression for GVHD. Of the patients diagnosed with rotavirus, 86% required hospitalisation. In 57% of the cases, other viral pathogens were isolated near to the rotavirus infection period. Rotavirus infection is an important cause of prolonged diarrhoea post SCT, causing significant morbidity and frequently requiring hospitalisation.","['Liakopoulou, E', 'Mutton, K', 'Carrington, D', 'Robinson, S', 'Steward, C G', 'Goulden, N J', 'Cornish, J M', 'Marks, D I']","['Liakopoulou E', 'Mutton K', 'Carrington D', 'Robinson S', 'Steward CG', 'Goulden NJ', 'Cornish JM', 'Marks DI']","['Bone Marrow Transplant Unit, Christie Hospital NHS Trust, Manchester, UK.

However, the mechanism by which Bcr-Abl induces cellular transformation has not yet been well characterized. Here, we show that Bcr-Abl-expressing cells are resistant to growth inhibition and apoptosis mediated by transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta). Interestingly, we observed that the suppressive effects of Bcr-Abl on TGF-beta responses were not mediated by an impairment of Smad signalling, which is believed to act as the principal mediator of TGF-beta responses. In contrast, we found that Bcr-Abl can target the protein kinase AKT and the transcription factor Fox O3 to interfere with growth inhibition and apoptosis in response to TGF-beta. Our results show a novel mechanism of cellular transformation by the oncogenic fusion protein Bcr-Abl through suppression of the cytostatic actions of TGF-beta.","['Atfi, Azeddine', 'Abecassis, Lucile', 'Bourgeade, Marie-Francoise']","['Atfi A', 'Abecassis L', 'Bourgeade MF']","['INSERM U482, 184 Rue du Faubourg St-Antoine, 75571 Paris, France. atfi@st-antoine.inserm.fr']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,EMBO Rep,EMBO reports,100963049,IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Forkhead Transcription Factors/*physiology', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/physiology', 'Phosphorylation', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/*physiology', 'Signal Transduction/*physiology', 'Transforming Growth Factor beta/biosynthesis/*physiology']",2005/08/23 09:00,2006/02/01 09:00,['2005/08/23 09:00'],"['2005/01/10 00:00 [received]', '2005/07/06 00:00 [revised]', '2005/07/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2005/08/23 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/02/01 09:00 [medline]', '2005/08/23 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,EMBO Rep. 2005 Oct;6(10):985-91. doi: 10.1038/sj.embor.7400501.,,"['0 (Forkhead Transcription Factors)', '0 (Transforming Growth Factor beta)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)']",,"['7400501 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.embor.7400501 [doi]']",,,,,PMC1369182,,,,,,,,,,,

Recently, haploinsufficiency for PU.1 has been shown to cause a shift in myelomonocytic progenitor fate toward the myeloid lineage. We have previously shown that transgenic mice expressing PML-RARalpha (PR) and RARalpha-PML frequently develop acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) in association with a large (>20 Mb) interstitial deletion of chromosome 2 that includes PU.1. To directly assess the relevance of levels of expression of PU.1 for leukemia progression, we bred hCG-PR mice with PU.1+/- mice and assessed their phenotype. Young, nonleukemic hCG-PR x PU.1+/- mice developed splenomegaly because of the abnormal expansion of myeloid cells in their spleens. hCG-PR x PU.1+/- mice developed a typical APL syndrome after a long latent period, but the penetrance of disease was 84%, compared with 7% in hCG-PR x PU.1+/+ mice (P < 0.0001). The residual PU.1 allele in hCG-PR x PU.1+/- APL cells was expressed, and complete exonic resequencing revealed no detectable mutations in nine of nine samples. However, PR expression in U937 myelomonocytic cells and primary murine myeloid bone marrow cells caused a reduction in PU.1 mRNA levels. Therefore, the loss of one copy of PU.1 through a deletional mechanism, plus down-regulation of the residual allele caused by PR expression, may synergize to expand the pool of myeloid progenitors that are susceptible to transformation, increasing the penetrance of APL.","['Walter, Matthew J', 'Park, John S', 'Ries, Rhonda E', 'Lau, Steven K M', 'McLellan, Michael', 'Jaeger, Sara', 'Wilson, Richard K', 'Mardis, Elaine R', 'Ley, Timothy J']","['Walter MJ', 'Park JS', 'Ries RE', 'Lau SK', 'McLellan M', 'Jaeger S', 'Wilson RK', 'Mardis ER', 'Ley TJ']","['Department of Medicine, Division of Oncology, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, MO 63110, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,IM,"['Animals', 'Chromosome Deletion', 'Down-Regulation', 'Gene Expression', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/etiology/*genetics/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Myeloid Progenitor Cells/*pathology', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*genetics', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*genetics', 'Phenotype', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/deficiency/*genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'RNA, Neoplasm/genetics/metabolism', 'Splenomegaly/etiology/genetics/pathology', 'Trans-Activators/deficiency/*genetics', 'U937 Cells']",2005/08/23 09:00,2005/10/14 09:00,['2005/08/23 09:00'],"['2005/08/23 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/10/14 09:00 [medline]', '2005/08/23 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2005 Aug 30;102(35):12513-8. doi: 10.1073/pnas.0504247102.

All were treated with chemotherapeutic drugs with an estimated high risk of inducing ovarian failure. METHODS: Twenty-two women with breast cancer (n = 8), Hodgkin's disease (n = 6), non-Hodgkin's (n = 2), leukaemia (n = 5) or brain tumour (n = 1) underwent a clinical examination >18 months after cryopreservation. Three patients with premature ovarian failure had ovarian tissue autotransplanted orthotopically and heterotopically. Ovarian function was assessed by ultrasonography of the remaining ovary and hormone measurements. RESULTS: Nine of 22 women (41%) had sonographic and hormonal signs of ovarian failure with ovarian volumes <1.3 cm3, no antral follicles and high FSH levels (median 57.1 IU/l). Thirteen of the 22 women (59%) still menstruated and 10 had a seemingly normal ovarian function, with a median ovarian volume of 6.8 cm3, a median number of antral follicles of six, FSH <15 IU/l and normal estradiol levels. All three patients with autotransplanted ovarian tissue regained ovarian function as confirmed by return of menses, follicles on ultrasonography and normalized hormone levels. Two embryos were created from the crypreserved tissue after IVF. CONCLUSIONS: Treatment with bone-marrow transplantation and/or high doses of alkylating agents led to ovarian failure in all patients.

Heparanase gene expression is upregulated during differentiation of immature myeloid cells. PML-RARalpha and PLZF-RARalpha fusion gene products associated with acute promyelocytic leukemia abrogate myeloid differentiation and heparanase expression. AML-Eto, a translocation product associated with AML FAB M2, also downregulates heparanase gene expression. The common mechanism that underlines the activity of these three fusion gene products involves the recruitment of histone deacetylase complexes to specific locations within the DNA. We found that retinoic acid that dissociates PML-RARalpha from the DNA, and which is used to treat acute promyelocytic leukemia patients, restores heparanase expression to normal levels in an acute promyelocytic leukemia cell line. The retinoic acid effects were also observed in primary acute promyelocytic leukemia cells and in a retinoic acid-treated acute promyelocytic leukemia patient. Histone deacetylase inhibitor reverses the downregulation of heparanase expression induced by the AML-Eto fusion gene product in M2 type AML. In summary, we have characterized a link between leukomogenic factors and the downregulation of heparanase in myeloid leukemic cells.","['Eshel, Rinat', 'Ben-Zaken, Olga', 'Vainas, Oded', 'Nadir, Yona', 'Minucci, Saverio', 'Polliack, Aaron', 'Naparstek, Ella', 'Vlodavsky, Israel', 'Katz, Ben-Zion']","['Eshel R', 'Ben-Zaken O', 'Vainas O', 'Nadir Y', 'Minucci S', 'Polliack A', 'Naparstek E', 'Vlodavsky I', 'Katz BZ']","['The Hematology Institute, Sourasky Medical Center, Tel-Aviv, Israel.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Biochem Biophys Res Commun,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,0372516,IM,"['Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Down-Regulation', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Glucuronidase/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*metabolism', 'Leukocytes/*metabolism', 'Neoplasm Proteins/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/*metabolism']",2005/08/23 09:00,2005/11/15 09:00,['2005/08/23 09:00'],"['2005/07/19 00:00 [received]', '2005/08/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2005/08/23 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/11/15 09:00 [medline]', '2005/08/23 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Biochem Biophys Res Commun. 2005 Oct 7;335(4):1115-22. doi: 10.1016/j.bbrc.2005.08.004.,,"['0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', 'EC 3.2.1.- (heparanase)', 'EC 3.2.1.31 (Glucuronidase)']",,"['S0006-291X(05)01676-1 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bbrc.2005.08.004 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is frequently overexpressed in malignant cells, one mechanism of which is through transcriptional activation by c-myc. Here, we report that high level of eIF4E expression and its tumorigenicity could be alternatively associated with defects of p53, since we found that induction of wt-p53 repressed eIF4E expression. Gene transfection of p53 inhibited eIF4E promoter activity, while inactivation of p53 either by mutation or by over-expression of MDM2 resulted in stimulation of eIF4E promoter activity. We demonstrated that p53-repression of eIF4E was regulated by c-myc. The wt-p53 can physically bind to c-myc, which inhibited binding of c-myc to eIF4E promoter and c-myc-stimulated promoter activity. These results suggest that the expression of eIF4E is reciprocally regulated by p53 and c-myc, and loss of p53-mediated control over c-myc-dependent transactivation of eIF4E may represent a novel mechanism for eIF4E-mediated neoplastic transformation and cancer progression.","['Zhu, Ningxi', 'Gu, Lubing', 'Findley, Harry W', 'Zhou, Muxiang']","['Zhu N', 'Gu L', 'Findley HW', 'Zhou M']","['Division of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology/BMT, Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, GA, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Biochem Biophys Res Commun,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,0372516,IM,"['Cell Line, Tumor', 'Child', 'Eukaryotic Initiation Factor-4E/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/*metabolism', '*Transcriptional Activation', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/*metabolism']",2005/08/23 09:00,2005/11/15 09:00,['2005/08/23 09:00'],"['2005/08/02 00:00 [received]', '2005/08/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2005/08/23 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/11/15 09:00 [medline]', '2005/08/23 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Biochem Biophys Res Commun. 2005 Oct 7;335(4):1272-9. doi: 10.1016/j.bbrc.2005.08.026.,['R01 CA82323/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['0 (Eukaryotic Initiation Factor-4E)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)']",,"['S0006-291X(05)01723-7 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bbrc.2005.08.026 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Five adult patients who had previously undergone autologous transplantation for a haematological malignancy at least 6 months before participated in the study. Interviews with the participants were audio taped and then transcribed verbatim. Nine themes emerged from the participants' stories and included psychological cost, physical and psychological adaptation, reprioritisation and a sense of isolation. The transplant experience can be separated into a discrete period of time and the findings illustrate that the experience of transplantation impacts on the life of the person for an undetermined period of time. The changes experienced may be permanent and the post-transplant person, emotionally, psychologically and physically, is not the same person who entered into transplant.

Our previous studies show that antimony trioxide (Sb(2)O(3)) induces growth inhibition in patient-derived acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) cell lines, a disease in which a related metal, arsenic trioxide (As(2)O(3)), is used clinically. However, signaling pathways initiated by Sb(2)O(3) treatment remain undefined. Here, we show that Sb(2)O(3) treatment of APL cells is associated with increased apoptosis as well as differentiation markers. Sb(2)O(3)-induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) correlated with increased apoptosis. In addition, when we decreased the buffering capacity of the cell by depleting glutathione, ROS production and apoptosis was enhanced. Arsenic-resistant APL cells with increased glutathione levels exhibited increased cross-resistance to Sb(2)O(3). Based on studies implicating c-jun kinase (JNK) in the mediation of the response to As(2)O(3), we investigated the role for JNK in Sb(2)O(3)-induced apoptosis. Sb(2)O(3) activates JNK and its downstream target, AP-1. In fibroblasts with a genetic deletion in SEK1, an upstream regulator of JNK, Sb(2)O(3)-induced growth inhibition as well as JNK activation was decreased. These data suggest roles for ROS and the SEK1/JNK pathway in the cytotoxicity associated with Sb(2)O(3) exposure.","['Mann, Koren K', 'Davison, Kelly', 'Colombo, Myrian', 'Colosimo, April L', 'Diaz, Zuanel', 'Padovani, Alessandra M S', 'Guo, Qi', 'Scrivens, P James', 'Gao, Wenli', 'Mader, Sylvie', 'Miller, Wilson H Jr']","['Mann KK', 'Davison K', 'Colombo M', 'Colosimo AL', 'Diaz Z', 'Padovani AM', 'Guo Q', 'Scrivens PJ', 'Gao W', 'Mader S', 'Miller WH Jr']","['Montreal Centre for Experimental Therapeutics in Cancer and Lady Davis Institute for Medical Research, SMBD Jewish General Hospital, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",Netherlands,Toxicol Lett,Toxicology letters,7709027,IM,"['Antimony/*toxicity', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'MAP Kinase Kinase 4/*metabolism', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 8/*metabolism', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Transcription Factor AP-1/metabolism']",2005/08/23 09:00,2006/01/04 09:00,['2005/08/23 09:00'],"['2005/03/01 00:00 [received]', '2005/06/28 00:00 [revised]', '2005/06/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2005/08/23 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/01/04 09:00 [medline]', '2005/08/23 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Toxicol Lett. 2006 Jan 5;160(2):158-70. doi: 10.1016/j.toxlet.2005.06.017.

We compared this strategy with intensified chemotherapy protocols, with the aim to improve the outcome of children with very-high-risk acute lymphoblastic leukaemia in first complete remission. METHODS: A cooperative prospective study was set up in seven countries. Very-high-risk acute lymphoblastic leukaemia in first complete remission was defined by the presence of at least one of the following criteria: (1) failure to achieve complete remission after the first four-drug induction phase; (2) t(9;22) or t(4;11) clonal abnormalities; and (3) poor response to prednisone associated with T immunophenotype, white-blood-cell count of 100x10(9)/L or greater, or both. Children were allocated treatment by genetic chance, according to the availability of a compatible related donor, and assigned chemotherapy or haemopoietic-cell transplantation. The primary outcome was disease-free survival and analysis was by intention to treat. FINDINGS: Between April, 1995, and December, 2000, 357 children entered the study, of whom 280 were assigned chemotherapy and 77 related-donor haemopoietic-cell transplantation. 5-year disease-free survival was 40.6% (SE 3.1) in children allocated chemotherapy and 56.7% (5.7) in those assigned transplantation (hazard ratio 0.67 [95% CI 0.46-0.99]; p=0.02); 5-year survival was 50.1% (3.1) and 56.4% (5.9), respectively (0.73 [0.49-1.09]; p=0.12). INTERPRETATION: Children with very-high-risk acute lymphoblastic leukaemia benefit from related-donor haemopoietic-cell transplantation compared with chemotherapy. The gap between the two strategies increases as the risk profile of the patient worsens.","['Balduzzi, Adriana', 'Valsecchi, Maria Grazia', 'Uderzo, Cornelio', 'De Lorenzo, Paola', 'Klingebiel, Thomas', 'Peters, Christina', 'Stary, Jan', 'Felice, Maria S', 'Magyarosy, Edina', 'Conter, Valentino', 'Reiter, Alfred', 'Messina, Chiara', 'Gadner, Helmut', 'Schrappe, Martin']","['Balduzzi A', 'Valsecchi MG', 'Uderzo C', 'De Lorenzo P', 'Klingebiel T', 'Peters C', 'Stary J', 'Felice MS', 'Magyarosy E', 'Conter V', 'Reiter A', 'Messina C', 'Gadner H', 'Schrappe M']","[""Clinica Pediatrica dell'Universita degli Studi di Milano Bicocca, Ospedale San Gerardo Via Pergolesi 33, 20052 Monza, Milan, Italy. adriana.balduzzi@pediatriamonza.it""]",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Lancet,"Lancet (London, England)",2985213R,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/mortality/*therapy', 'Recurrence', 'Remission Induction', 'Risk Factors', 'Survival Rate', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",2005/08/23 09:00,2005/10/07 09:00,['2005/08/23 09:00'],"['2005/08/23 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/10/07 09:00 [medline]', '2005/08/23 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Lancet. 2005 Aug 20-26;366(9486):635-42. doi: 10.1016/S0140-6736(05)66998-X.,,,,"['S0140-6736(05)66998-X [pii]', '10.1016/S0140-6736(05)66998-X [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The AML blast cells in these elderly patients are often characterised by several unfavourable covariates that predict the poor treatment outcome, including high stem cell marker CD34 expression, minimally or undifferentiated features, high P-glycoprotein expression, high bcl-2/bax ratio, unfavourable karyotype and more frequent internal tandem duplications (ITDs) and mutations of class III receptor-type tyrosine kinase for key haematopoietic cytokines: Flt-3 (receptor for Flt-ligand), c-kit (receptor for stem cell factor) and fms (receptor for M-CSF). Testing the new and more specific molecular-targeted therapeutic approaches in CD34+ AML cells can provide the basis for a more effective combined molecular/chemotherapy regimen and may consequently improve the treatment outcome in elderly AML patients. Therefore, the present study was performed to evaluate whether stem cell factor-antibody (anti-SCF) can enhance the efficacy of the two main chemotherapeutic drugs used in AML therapy: cytarabine and daunorubicin at low doses in human-resistant CD34+ AML cells, in an attempt to identify a novel effective regimen with tolerable side-effects for elderly AML patients. The effect of anti-SCF on each of the two chemotherapeutic drugs-induced apoptosis and necrosis was investigated in KG1a human-resistant CD34+ AML cells expressing P-glycoprotein to determine its enhancing activity. Anti-SCF has significantly enhanced the low dose cytarabine- and daunorubicin-induced apoptosis+necrosis in KG1a CD34+ AML cells from 12.0+/-1.7 to 40.9+/-5.9% and from 16.3+/-0.9 to 48.9+/-1.0%, respectively, p<0.01. It has also exerted its significant enhancement activity on the low dose cytarabine- and daunorubicin-induced apoptosis+necrosis in KG1a CD34+ AML cells in the presence of SCF, p<0.05. Anti-SCF has significantly enhanced the low dose cytarabine- and daunorubicin-induced bcl-2 reduction in KG1a CD34+ AML cells from 26.7+/-0.6 to 64.6+/-1.0% and from 59.8+/-3.1 to 80.1+/-7.9%, respectively, p<0.01. The addition of SCF has not altered the low dose cytarabine- and daunorubicin-induced bcl-2 reduction in KG1a CD34+ AML cells (Table 4). Anti-SCF has also significantly enhanced the low dose cytarabine- and daunorubicin-induced bcl-2 reduction in KG1a CD34+ AML cells in the presence of SCF, p<0.05. The unique potent enhancing activity of anti-SCF on low dose chemotherapy-induced apoptosis and necrosis in extremely resistant AML cells suggest a novel promising role for the treatment of elderly AML patients. Further studies are warranted to evaluate a similar enhancing effect for anti-SCF in blast cells from elderly AML patients in primary cultures before its introduction in a pilot clinical study. In conclusion, the combination of anti-SCF and the low dose cytarabine provides a promising solution for the dilemma of therapy in elderly AML patients.","['Lu, C', 'Hassan, H T']","['Lu C', 'Hassan HT']","['Institute of Medical Sciences, University of Lincoln, Brayford Pool, Lincoln LN6 1ST, UK.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/biosynthesis', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', '*Antigens, CD34/biosynthesis', 'Antineoplastic Agents/immunology/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', '*Biomarkers, Tumor/biosynthesis', 'Blast Crisis/drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Cytarabine/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Daunorubicin/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Drug Evaluation, Preclinical', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/drug effects', 'Drug Synergism', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Male', 'Pilot Projects', 'Receptors, Cytokine/metabolism', 'Stem Cell Factor/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Treatment Outcome', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein/biosynthesis']",2005/08/23 09:00,2006/03/15 09:00,['2005/08/23 09:00'],"['2005/03/01 00:00 [received]', '2005/06/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2005/08/23 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/03/15 09:00 [medline]', '2005/08/23 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 2006 Mar;30(3):296-302. doi: 10.1016/j.leukres.2005.06.026.

Here, we analyzed the incidences of HCV and hepatitis B virus (HBV) infections, and the clinicopathologic features in 29 cases of splenic diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), 10 SMZL, 3 splenic mantle cell lymphoma, 1 hairy cell leukemia, 13 B-chronic lymphocytic leukemia, and 12 hepatosplenic T-cell and natural killer cell lymphoma. Fifteen (51.7%) splenic DLBCL cases were HCV antibody-positive, and another 6 (20.7%) had the HBsAg. The incidence of each was significantly (P < .01) higher than those of HCV (9.3%) and HBV (1.9%) infections in 54 node-based DLBCL cases. Four examined HCV-positive DLBCL cases showed no type II cryoglobulinemia. HCV RNA was detected in fresh tumor tissues from 6 of 7 examined DLBCL cases, and HBV DNA was present in another 2, as evaluated by real-time polymerase chain reaction. Immunohistologically, tumor cells in 5 of 7 examined DLBCL cases showed intracytoplasmic reactions for HCV NS3 and E2 proteins and the viral receptor CD81. Of 6 cases, 2 showed an intranuclear reaction for the HBV surface protein. By Southern blot analysis, no rearrangement of the Bcl2 gene was detected in the tumor tissue of 7 HCV-positive DLBCL cases. For the other types of malignant lymphoma, 1 case each of SMZL (10%) and hepatosplenic T-cell and natural killer cell lymphoma (8.3%) showed HCV infection.

Bone marrow cells were obtained from 33 CML patients, including patients at diagnosis, before treatment (n=12), and patients that have achieved hematological remission (and in most cases a major cytogenetic response) after different therapeutic procedures (n=21), including patients treated with Interferon-alpha (IFN; n=5), imatinib mesylate (IMATINIB; n=8) and patients that received an allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT; n=8). Marrow cells were enriched for CD34(+) cells and cultured in a serum- and stroma-free liquid culture system, supplemented with a combination of 8 recombinant cytokines. Normal samples were studied as controls. HPC from CML patients before therapy showed deficient proliferation and expansion potentials in culture (140-fold increase in nucleated cell number and 1.3-fold increase in colony-forming cell number) as compared to normal progenitors (1200-fold increase in nucleated cell number and 25-fold increase in colony-forming cell number). In contrast, HPC from patients treated with IMATINIB showed growth potentials similar to those of normal progenitors. Progenitors from patients after HCT also showed significant proliferation and expansion capacities. Interestingly, progenitors from IFN-treated patients showed proliferation and expansion kinetics similar to those of cells from untreated patients. These results indicate that, although treatment of CML patients with IFN, IMATINIB or HCT resulted in complete hematological remission (and a major cytogenetic response), only patients treated with IMATINIB and, to a lesser extent, with HCT showed a full hematopoietic recovery, as determined by the in vitro growth of HPC in our culture system.","['Chavez-Gonzalez, Antonieta', 'Ayala-Sanchez, Manuel', 'Sanchez-Valle, Elizabeth', 'Ruiz-Sanchez, Elizabeth', 'Arana-Trejo, Rosa Maria', 'Vela-Ojeda, Jorge', 'Mayani, Hector']","['Chavez-Gonzalez A', 'Ayala-Sanchez M', 'Sanchez-Valle E', 'Ruiz-Sanchez E', 'Arana-Trejo RM', 'Vela-Ojeda J', 'Mayani H']","['Oncological Research Unit, Oncology Hospital, Siglo XXI National Medical Center, IMSS, Mexico City, Mexico.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,IM,"['Benzamides', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'Female', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*metabolism/pathology', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Interferon-alpha/administration & dosage', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*metabolism/pathology/*therapy', 'Male', 'Piperazines/administration & dosage', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'Pyrimidines/administration & dosage', '*Recovery of Function', 'Remission Induction', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",2005/08/23 09:00,2006/03/15 09:00,['2005/08/23 09:00'],"['2005/02/02 00:00 [received]', '2005/06/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2005/08/23 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/03/15 09:00 [medline]', '2005/08/23 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 2006 Mar;30(3):286-95. doi: 10.1016/j.leukres.2005.06.028.

The cytotoxicity of polyphenols in bovine leukemia virus-transformed lamb kidney fibroblasts (line FLK), and human promyelocytic leukemia cells (line HL-60) was partly inhibited by catalase, by the antioxidant N,N'-diphenyl-p-phenylene diamine and desferrioxamine, and potentiated by 1,3-bis-(2-chloro-ethyl)-1-nitrosourea, thus showing its prooxidant character. Dapsone, an inhibitor of myeloperoxidase, did not affect the cytotoxicity of polyphenols in HL-60 cells, whereas dicumarol, an inhibitor of DT-diaphorase, showed controversial effects on their cytotoxicity in FLK cells. Inhibitors of cytochromes P-450, alpha-naphthoflavone and izoniazide, decreased the cytotoxicity of several polyphenols, whereas 3,5-dinitrocatechol, an inhibitor of catechol-o-methyltransferase (COMT), increased it. The cytotoxicity of 13 polyhydroxybenzenes was described by the equations: logcL50 (microM) = -0.67 + 5.46E(7)(2) (V) - 0.16 logD (FLK), and logcL50 (microM) = -1.39 + 6.90E(7)(2) (V) - 0.20logD (HL-60), where cL50 is compound concentration for 50% cell survival, and D is octanol/water distribution coefficient at pH 7.0. The flavonoids comprise a separate series of compounds with lower cytotoxicity. The correlations obtained quantitatively confirm the parallelism between the polyphenol cytotoxicity and the rates of their single-electron oxidation, and point to the leading role of formation of the reactive oxygen species in their cytotoxicity. Depending on the examined system, this parallelism may be distorted due to the cytochrome P-450 and COMT-catalyzed transformation of polyphenols.","['Nemeikaite-Ceniene, Ausra', 'Imbrasaite, Ausra', 'Sergediene, Egle', 'Cenas, Narimantas']","['Nemeikaite-Ceniene A', 'Imbrasaite A', 'Sergediene E', 'Cenas N']","['Institute of Immunology of Vilnius University, Moletu Pl. 29, LT-08409 Vilnius, Lithuania.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Arch Biochem Biophys,Archives of biochemistry and biophysics,0372430,IM,"['Animals', 'Antioxidants/chemistry/toxicity', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Fibroblasts/*cytology/*drug effects', 'Flavonoids/*chemistry/*toxicity', 'Kidney/cytology/drug effects', 'Lethal Dose 50', 'Oxidation-Reduction', 'Phenol/chemistry/toxicity', 'Phenols/*chemistry/*toxicity', 'Polyphenols', '*Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Sheep']",2005/08/23 09:00,2005/10/29 09:00,['2005/08/23 09:00'],"['2005/06/17 00:00 [received]', '2005/07/13 00:00 [revised]', '2005/07/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2005/08/23 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/10/29 09:00 [medline]', '2005/08/23 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Arch Biochem Biophys. 2005 Sep 15;441(2):182-90. doi: 10.1016/j.abb.2005.07.002.,,"['0 (Antioxidants)', '0 (Flavonoids)', '0 (Phenols)', '0 (Polyphenols)', '3229-70-7 (phenoxy radical)', '339NCG44TV (Phenol)']",,"['S0003-9861(05)00285-7 [pii]', '10.1016/j.abb.2005.07.002 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although the leukemia often resembles CML in morphological and in clinical terms, a Ph-Chromosome-positive variant has not been reported in SM so far. We here describe a 43-year-old female patient with typical Ph-Chromosome-positive CML in whom a co-existing bone marrow mastocytosis, a special subvariant of SM, was diagnosed. RT-PCR analysis revealed the typical p210 kDa form of BCR/ABL in leukemic cells. The diagnosis SM was based on the typical focal aggregates of spindle-shaped mast cells (MC) in the bone marrow, expression of CD25 in MC, and the c-kit mutation D816V, which was detectable in microdissected bone marrow MC, but not in microdissected leukemic cells, suggesting the presence of two different (sub)clones of neoplastic cells. Therapy with the BCR/ABL-targeting drug Imatinib (STI571) resulted in complete cytogenetic remission of CML.

Telomeres are thought to be critical in maintaining normal hematopoiesis. In this study, we assessed telomere dynamics in order to obtain further insight into the pathogenesis of MDS. We studied telomerase activity (TA) in mononuclear cells from peripheral blood (PB) and bone marrow (BM) from patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS; n=24), acute myeloid leukemia (AML; n=14), chronic myeloid leukemia (CML; n=12) and 11 normal controls using a polymerase chain reaction-based telomeric repeat amplification assay. Telomerase activities (mean+/-S.D.) were found as 0.199+/-0.09, 0.414+/-0.55, 0.253+/-0.26 and 0.181+/-0.05 pg/ml in PB mononuclear cells, respectively (P>0.05). Comparison of TA of BM mononuclear cells from 19 MDS patients versus 10 BM samples from normal controls revealed no significant difference (P=0.3). There was no correlation between the levels of TA and clinical and prognostic parameters of the patients with MDS, such as degree of anemia, platelet counts on presentation, gender, presence of organomegaly, bone marrow fibrosis and BM blast percentages. Patients who had higher TA had significantly inferior survival compared with patients who had lower TA (P=0.005). Consistent with previous data, our results suggest that in patients with MDS, telomerase activity might be insufficient to compensate for the telomere shortening. Furthermore, TA might be prognostically important in patients with MDS. Measurements of enzymatic activity in association with telomere length studies may help to understand the prognostic role of telomere dynamics in patients with myelodysplastic syndromes more reliably.","['Gurkan, Emel', 'Tanriverdi, Kahraman', 'Baslamisli, Fikri']","['Gurkan E', 'Tanriverdi K', 'Baslamisli F']","['Department of Hematology, Cukurova University Medical School, Balcali, Adana 01330, Turkey. egurkan@cu.edu.tr']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Bone Marrow/enzymology', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/diagnosis/*enzymology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/diagnosis/*enzymology', 'Lymphocytes/enzymology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/diagnosis/*enzymology', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Survival Rate', 'Telomerase/*metabolism']",2005/08/23 09:00,2005/10/19 09:00,['2005/08/23 09:00'],"['2004/11/30 00:00 [received]', '2005/08/23 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/10/19 09:00 [medline]', '2005/08/23 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 2005 Oct;29(10):1131-9. doi: 10.1016/j.leukres.2005.03.006.

There is increased evidence of association between CLL and skin cancers, including the uncommon Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC). CASE PRESENTATION: A case report of an 84-year old male, who presented with an aggressively recurrent form of MCC on the lower lip, on the background of an 8-year history of untreated CLL. During the recurrences of MCC, coexisting regional lymphadenopathy, posed a problem in the differential diagnosis and treatment of lymph node involvement. Histopathology and immunoistochemistry showed that submandibular lymphadenopathy coexisting with the second recurrence of MCC, was due to B-cell small lymphocytic lymphoma. The subsequent and more aggressive recurrence of the skin tumor had involved the superficial and deep cervical lymph nodes. Surgical excision followed by involved field radiation therapy has been proven effective for both malignancies. CONCLUSION: MCC has a high incidence of regional lymphadenopathy at presentation (12-45%) and even when it arises on the background of chronic leukemia, lymphadenopathy at presentation should be managed agressively with elective lymph node dissection. We overview the postulated correlation between Merkel tumor and CCL, the differential diagnosis of regional lymphadenopathy during the recurrences of the skin tumor and the strategies of treatment.","['Papageorgiou, K I', 'Kaniorou-Larai, M G']","['Papageorgiou KI', 'Kaniorou-Larai MG']","['St Andrews Center of Burns and Plastic Surgery, Broomfield Hospital, Chelmsford, CM1 7ET, UK. papageorgiouk@doctors.org.uk']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",England,BMC Cancer,BMC cancer,100967800,IM,"['Aged, 80 and over', 'Carcinoma, Merkel Cell/complications/*diagnosis', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/complications/*diagnosis', 'Lip Neoplasms/metabolism/pathology', 'Lymphatic Diseases/complications/*diagnosis', 'Lymphatic Metastasis', 'Male', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Recurrence', 'Skin Neoplasms/complications/diagnosis']",2005/08/23 09:00,2006/02/28 09:00,['2005/08/23 09:00'],"['2005/03/30 00:00 [received]', '2005/08/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2005/08/23 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/02/28 09:00 [medline]', '2005/08/23 09:00 [entrez]']",epublish,BMC Cancer. 2005 Aug 19;5:106. doi: 10.1186/1471-2407-5-106.,,,,"['1471-2407-5-106 [pii]', '10.1186/1471-2407-5-106 [doi]']",,,,20050819,PMC1208865,,,,,,,,,,,

More recently, the application of pegylation technology has created a second-generation molecule, pegfilgrastim, with significantly altered pharmacokinetic properties. This has allowed for a once per chemotherapy cycle dosing in contrast to the requirement of daily subcutaneous administration for filgrastim. Several randomized trials in nonmyeloid malignancies have proven that a fixed dose of pegfilgrastim 6 mg is at least equivalent to daily filgrastim therapy. Emerging evidence also suggests that pegfilgrastim may be equally employed in the setting of chemotherapy for acute myeloid leukemia, dose-dense chemotherapy and peripheral stem cell mobilization. If confirmed in subsequent Phase III trials, it is likely that pegfilgrastim will eventually succeed filgrastim as the colony-stimulating factor of choice in clinical practice.","['Ng, Raymond', 'Green, Michael D']","['Ng R', 'Green MD']","['Department of Haemotology and Medical Oncology, Royal Melbourne Hospital, Australia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Expert Rev Anticancer Ther,Expert review of anticancer therapy,101123358,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Breast Neoplasms/drug therapy', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Economics, Pharmaceutical', 'Filgrastim', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/adverse effects/economics/pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Mobilization', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/drug therapy', 'Lymphoma/drug therapy', 'Neutropenia/*chemically induced/*drug therapy', 'Polyethylene Glycols', 'Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic', 'Recombinant Proteins']",2005/08/23 09:00,2006/02/08 09:00,['2005/08/23 09:00'],"['2005/08/23 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/02/08 09:00 [medline]', '2005/08/23 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Expert Rev Anticancer Ther. 2005 Aug;5(4):585-90. doi: 10.1586/14737140.5.4.585.,,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '3A58010674 (pegfilgrastim)', '3WJQ0SDW1A (Polyethylene Glycols)', 'PVI5M0M1GW (Filgrastim)']",41,['10.1586/14737140.5.4.585 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

New host groups such as patients with multiple myeloma or low-grade lymphoproliferative disorders have contributed to an increase in the incidence of invasive aspergillosis over recent years. There are substantial differences in the diagnostic strategy and therapeutic outcome of disease between patients with a hematological malignancy and other host groups such as allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant patients. Galactomannan detection ELISA test is more specific in adult patients with hematological malignancies than in hematopoietic stem cell transplantation recipients. As a result of possible improvement of the underlying immune deficiency upon recovery from neutropenia, survival is higher in leukemic patients with invasive aspergillosis than in other host groups. However, there is currently no evidence of an effective antifungal prophylaxis strategy against aspergillosis in leukemic patients.

Coordination between innate and adaptive immune system is critical to resistance or susceptibility to Candida infection. In order to investigate possible genetic contribution to chronic disseminated candidiasis of key molecules in the innate immune pathway, we performed a case control study using the candidate gene approach. Forty subjects with chronic disseminated candidiasis and 50 controls without chronic disseminated candidiasis but an underlying diagnosis of leukemia were enrolled in the Helsinki University Central Hospital during the period 1980-1998. Candidate genes were selected for analysis based upon the following criteria: a common polymorphism (>5% frequency) and existence a priori of clinical and biological data suggesting a role for the variant in the pathogenesis of chronic disseminated candidiasis. Six genes were selected from critical microbicidal and innate immune pathways, including three low-affinity Fcgamma receptors (FCGR2A, FCGR3A and FCGR3B), chitotriosidase (CHIT1), p22-phox NADPH oxidase (CYBA), and mannose binding lectin (MBL2).

Therefore, the possible influence of these drugs on host immunity appears to be of considerable interest. We have examined in vitro the effect of morphine on the generation of human cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) against HTLV-I induced T-cell leukemia cells (MT-2 line). The results show that the drug, at graded concentrations (from 3 pg/ml to 32 microg/ml), that include those detectable in treated patients, enhances CTL activity whereas natural killer cell activity was unaffected. The enhancing effect is particularly evident when morphine was present at the onset of lymphocyte/MT-2 co-culture. On the contrary, the drug was ineffective when added on the last day of co-culture, thus indicating that morphine operates during the generation phase of CTL, but not on mature CTL. Flow cytometric analysis of intracellular cytokine expression showed that morphine increases the percentage of interferon gamma-producing CD8+ T cells in co-culture assay. Collectively, these results suggest that in our experimental model morphine enhances CTL responses by directly affecting the induction phase of T-dependent cell-mediated immunity.","['Fuggetta, M P', 'Di Francesco, P', 'Falchetti, R', 'Cottarelli, A', 'Rossi, L', 'Tricarico, M', 'Lanzilli, G']","['Fuggetta MP', 'Di Francesco P', 'Falchetti R', 'Cottarelli A', 'Rossi L', 'Tricarico M', 'Lanzilli G']","['Inst. of Neurobiology and Molecular Medicine, Molecular Medicine Section, CNR, University of Rome -Tor Vergata, Rome, Italy.

RUNX proteins are targeted to gene regulatory micro-environments within the nucleus via a specific subnuclear targeting signal. However, the dynamics of RUNX distribution and compartmentalization between the cytoplasm and nucleus is minimally understood. Here we show by immunofluorescence microscopy that RUNX2 relocates from the nucleus to the cytoplasm when microtubules are stabilized by the chemotherapeutic agent taxol. The taxol-dependent cytoplasmic accumulation of RUNX2 is inhibited by leptomycin B, which blocks CRM-1 dependent nuclear export, and is not affected by the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide. Using biochemical assays, we show that endogenous RUNX2 associates with stabilized microtubules in a concentration-dependent manner and that the RUNX2 amino terminus mediates the microtubule association. In soluble fractions of cells, RUNX2 co-immunoprecipitates alpha tubulin suggesting that microtubule binding involves the alpha/beta tubulin subunits. We conclude that RUNX2 associates with microtubules and shuttles between the nucleus and the cytoplasm. We propose that nuclear-cytoplasmic shuttling of RUNX2 may modulate its transcriptional activity, as well as its ability to interface with signal transduction pathways that are integrated at RUNX2 containing subnuclear sites. It is possible that taxol-induced acute depletion of the nuclear levels of RUNX2 and/or other cell growth regulatory factors may represent an alternative pathway by which taxol exerts its biological effects during cancer chemotherapies.","['Pockwinse, Shirwin M', 'Rajgopal, Arun', 'Young, Daniel W', 'Mujeeb, Khwaja A', 'Nickerson, Jeffrey', 'Javed, Amjad', 'Redick, Sambra', 'Lian, Jane B', 'van Wijnen, Andre J', 'Stein, Janet L', 'Stein, Gary S', 'Doxsey, Stephen J']","['Pockwinse SM', 'Rajgopal A', 'Young DW', 'Mujeeb KA', 'Nickerson J', 'Javed A', 'Redick S', 'Lian JB', 'van Wijnen AJ', 'Stein JL', 'Stein GS', 'Doxsey SJ']","['Department of Cell Biology, University of Massachusetts Medical School, Worcester, Massachusetts 01605, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",United States,J Cell Physiol,Journal of cellular physiology,0050222,IM,"['Active Transport, Cell Nucleus', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Nucleus/*metabolism', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 1 Subunit/*metabolism/physiology', 'Cytoplasm/*metabolism', 'Dimethyl Sulfoxide/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Microtubules/drug effects/*metabolism/physiology', 'Paclitaxel/pharmacology', 'Tubulin/*metabolism']",2005/08/20 09:00,2006/03/11 09:00,['2005/08/20 09:00'],"['2005/08/20 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/03/11 09:00 [medline]', '2005/08/20 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Cell Physiol. 2006 Feb;206(2):354-62. doi: 10.1002/jcp.20469.,"['R01 AR049069/AR/NIAMS NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA82834/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 DK32520/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States']","['0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 1 Subunit)', '0 (Tubulin)', 'P88XT4IS4D (Paclitaxel)', 'YOW8V9698H (Dimethyl Sulfoxide)']",,['10.1002/jcp.20469 [doi]'],,"['Copyright (c) 2005 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

They typically associate with immediate hypersensitive responses and are likely to play a critical role in host defense. In this chapter, a common airway pathogen, Moraxella catarrhalis, and a commensal bacterium, Neiserria cinerea, are used to illustrate activation of human mast cells. A human mast cell line (HMC-1) derived from a patient with mast cell leukemia was activated with varying concentrations of heat-killed bacteria. Active aggregation of bacteria over mast cell surfaces was detected by scanning electron microscopy. The activation of mast cells was analyzed by nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) activation and cytokine production in culture supernatants. Both M. catarrhalis and N. cinerea induce mast cell activation and the secretion of two key inflammatory cytokines, interleukin-6 and MCP-1. This is accompanied by NF-kappaB activation. Direct bacterial contact with mast cells appears to be essential for this activation because neither cell-free bacterial supernatants nor bacterial lipopolysaccharide induce cytokine secretion.","['Chi, David S', 'Walker, Elaine S', 'Hossler, Fred E', 'Krishnaswamy, Guha']","['Chi DS', 'Walker ES', 'Hossler FE', 'Krishnaswamy G']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Quillen College of Medicine, East Tennessee State University, Johnson City, TN, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Methods Mol Biol,"Methods in molecular biology (Clifton, N.J.)",9214969,IM,"['Cells, Cultured', 'Hot Temperature', 'Humans', 'Mast Cells/*immunology/ultrastructure', 'Microscopy, Electron, Scanning', 'Moraxella catarrhalis/*immunology', 'Neisseria cinerea/*immunology']",2005/08/20 09:00,2005/12/13 09:00,['2005/08/20 09:00'],"['2005/08/20 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/12/13 09:00 [medline]', '2005/08/20 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Methods Mol Biol. 2006;315:383-92. doi: 10.1385/1-59259-967-2:383.,"['AI-43310/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'HL-63070/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",,,"['1-59259-967-2:383 [pii]', '10.1385/1-59259-967-2:383 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In recent years, new molecular prognostic factors have emerged in CLL that have significantly improved the subgrouping of the disease. One of the most important molecular predictors, the immunoglobulin V(H) gene mutation status, divides CLL into two prognostic groups, depending on the presence or absence of somatic hypermutation, where unmutated V(H) genes are associated with considerably worse prognosis than mutated V(H) genes. An exception to this appears to be CLL patients utilizing the V(H)3-21 gene as they have poor outcome irrespective of mutation status. Surrogate markers for the VH gene mutation status have been suggested, such as CD38 and ZAP-70 expression. However, the CD38 level was later shown to display poor correlation to the mutation status, although it may still serve as an independent prognostic factor. More promising is the expression levels of ZAP-70, which appears to be both a strong surrogate marker for V(H) gene mutation status, although discrepancies have been reported, as well as an independent prognostic marker. Immunoglobulin gene analysis has also indicated the possibility of antigen selection in CLL considering the significant bias in V(H) gene usage. Intriguingly, the V(H)3-21+ group and several other CLL subsets using certain V(H) genes was recently reported to display strikingly restricted immunoglobulin gene features, in both their heavy and light chain gene rearrangements, thus further high-lighting the possible role of antigen involvement in CLL development.","['Tobin, Gerard', 'Rosenquist, Richard']","['Tobin G', 'Rosenquist R']","['Department of Genetics and Pathology, Rudbeck Laboratory, Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden. gerard.tobin@genpat.uu.se']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Med Oncol,"Medical oncology (Northwood, London, England)",9435512,IM,"['Antigens, Neoplasm/analysis', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/analysis', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Variable Region/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*genetics/*pathology', 'Prognosis', '*Somatic Hypermutation, Immunoglobulin', 'Survival']",2005/08/20 09:00,2006/01/19 09:00,['2005/08/20 09:00'],"['2005/01/31 00:00 [received]', '2005/02/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2005/08/20 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/01/19 09:00 [medline]', '2005/08/20 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Med Oncol. 2005;22(3):217-28. doi: 10.1385/MO:22:3:217.,,"['0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Variable Region)']",95,"['MO:22:3:217 [pii]', '10.1385/MO:22:3:217 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recent studies, however, have shown different gene profiling for the two groups, underscoring potential biologic differences. Therefore, we sought to determine whether these two cytogenetic groups should also be considered separate entities from a clinical standpoint. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We analyzed 144 consecutive adults with t(8;21) and 168 with inv(16) treated on Cancer and Leukemia Group B front-line studies. We compared pretreatment features, probability of achieving complete remission (CR), overall survival (OS) and cumulative incidence of relapse (CIR) between the two groups. RESULTS: With a median follow-up of 6.4 years, for CBF AML as a whole, the CR rate was 88%, 5-year OS was 50% and CIR was 53%. After adjusting for covariates, patients with t(8;21) had shorter OS (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.5; P = .045) and survival after first relapse (HR = 1.7; P = .009) than patients with inv(16). Unexpectedly, race was an important predictor for t(8;21) AML, in that nonwhites failed induction more often (odds ratio = 5.7; P = .006) and had shorter OS than whites when certain secondary cytogenetic abnormalities were present.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: In a prospective study of 75 consecutive patients (median age, 52.3 years), high risk was defined by progressive or refractory disease (n = 59), second remission after early relapse (n = 8), or first remission with poor prognosis based on cytogenetics or delayed response to induction therapy (n = 8). Unfavorable karyotypes were found in 49% of informative patients, and 68 patients had medical contraindications against standard conditioning. Fludarabine (30 mg/m2), cytarabine (2 g/m2), and amsacrine (100 mg/m2) for 4 days were used for cytoreduction. After 3 days of rest, RIC consisted of 4 Gy total-body irradiation, antithymocyte globulin, and 80 to 120 mg/kg cyclophosphamide. Thirty-one patients had an HLA-identical sibling donor; 44 patients had an unrelated and/or HLA-mismatched donor. pDLT was given from day +120 in patients who were not receiving immunosuppression and were free of graft-versus-host disease (GvHD). RESULTS: Complete remission was induced in 66 patients (88%). With a median follow-up of 35.1 months (range, 13.6 to 47.6 months), 2-year overall and leukemia-free survival were 42% and 40%, respectively. Outcome of patients with refractory disease or with complex cytogenetic aberrations was identical to that of better prognostic subgroups. Survival was best in patients who received high CD34+ cell numbers, and in patients with limited GvHD. CONCLUSION: Sequential use of intensive chemotherapy, RIC transplantation, and pDLT represents a promising approach to the treatment of high-risk AML and MDS, particularly in patients with most unfavorable prognoses.","['Schmid, Christoph', 'Schleuning, Michael', 'Ledderose, Georg', 'Tischer, Johanna', 'Kolb, Hans-Jochem']","['Schmid C', 'Schleuning M', 'Ledderose G', 'Tischer J', 'Kolb HJ']","['Jose Carreras Unit for Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, Department of Medicine III, Ludwig-Maximilians-University Hospital, Marchioninistr 15, 81379 Munich, Germany.

METHODS: One hundred sixty-one ALL survivors diagnosed at Childrens Hospital Los Angeles (Los Angeles, CA) before age 18 years and between January 1, 1975 and December 31, 1995, participated in a structured telephone interview. Participants were aged 18 to 41 years and off treatment for an average of 14 years. Four measures of fatigue, including the Revised-Piper Fatigue Scale, were used to assess fatigue; depression was assessed using the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale. Multivariate logistic regression models were developed to identify factors associated with fatigue and depression. RESULTS: Prevalence of fatigue (30%) fell within the general population normal limits. Fatigue and depression were highly correlated (Pearson r = 0.75). Fatigue was associated with marriage (OR = 0.11; 95% CI, 0.02 to 0.50), having children (OR = 5.80; 95% CI, 1.30 to 25.82), sleep disturbances (OR = 6.15; 95% CI, 2.33 to 16.22), pain (OR = 5.56; 95% CI, 2.13 to 14.48), obesity (OR = 3.80; 95% CI, 1.41 to 10.26), cognitive impairment (OR = 2.56; 95% CI, 1.02 to 6.38), and exercise-induced symptoms (OR = 2.98; 95% CI, 1.11 to 8.02). Four factors associated with fatigue were also associated with depression: sleep disturbances, pain, obesity, and cognitive impairment. Fatigue was inversely related to QOL. CONCLUSION: Some survivors of childhood ALL experience fatigue many years after treatment. Fatigued survivors represent a high-risk subgroup as they report more depression and poorer QOL than non-fatigued survivors and their peers.","['Meeske, Kathleen A', 'Siegel, Stuart E', 'Globe, Denise R', 'Mack, Wendy J', 'Bernstein, Leslie']","['Meeske KA', 'Siegel SE', 'Globe DR', 'Mack WJ', 'Bernstein L']","['Department of Preventive Medicine and USC/Norris Comprehensive Cancer Center, Los Angeles, CA, USA. kmeeske@chla.usc.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Chi-Square Distribution', 'Fatigue/*epidemiology/*etiology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Logistic Models', 'Los Angeles/epidemiology', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*complications', 'Prevalence', '*Quality of Life', 'Risk Factors', '*Survivors']",2005/08/20 09:00,2005/09/24 09:00,['2005/08/20 09:00'],"['2005/08/20 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/09/24 09:00 [medline]', '2005/08/20 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2005 Aug 20;23(24):5501-10. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2005.03.210.,['5P30 CA14089-25/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,"['23/24/5501 [pii]', '10.1200/JCO.2005.03.210 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We show that NPM1 mutations are significantly underrepresented in patients younger than 35 years. NPM1 mutations positively correlate with AML with high white blood cell counts, normal karyotypes, and fms-like tyrosine kinase-3 gene (FLT3) internal tandem duplication (ITD) mutations. NPM1 mutations associate inversely with the occurrence of CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein-alpha (CEBPA) and NRAS mutations. With respect to gene expression profiling, we show that AML cases with an NPM1 mutation cluster in specific subtypes of AML with previously established gene expression signatures, are highly associated with a homeobox gene-specific expression signature, and can be predicted with high accuracy. We demonstrate that patients with intermediate cytogenetic risk AML without FLT3 ITD mutations but with NPM1 mutations have a significantly better overall survival (OS) and event-free survival (EFS) than those without NPM1 mutations.

Here we show that insertional mutagenesis can also identify genes that promote the immortalization of hematopoietic cells, which normally have only limited self-renewal. Transduction of mouse bone marrow cells with replication-incompetent murine stem cell virus (MSCV) expressing only neo, followed by serial passage in liquid culture containing stem cell factor (SCF) and interleukin-3 (IL-3), produced immortalized immature myeloid cell lines with neutrophil and macrophage differentiation potential in about 50% of the infected cultures. More than half of the lines have MSCV insertions at Evi1 or Prdm16. These loci encode transcription factor homologs and are validated human myeloid leukemia genes. Integrations are located in intron 1 or 2, where they promote expression of truncated proteins lacking the PRDI-BF1-RIZ1 homologous (PR) domain, similar to what is observed in human leukemias with EVI1 or PRDM16 mutations. Evi1 overexpression alone appears sufficient to immortalize immature myeloid cells and does not seem to require any other cooperating mutations. Genes identified by insertional mutagenesis by their nature could also be involved in immortalization of leukemic stem cells, and thus represent attractive drug targets for treating cancer.","['Du, Yang', 'Jenkins, Nancy A', 'Copeland, Neal G']","['Du Y', 'Jenkins NA', 'Copeland NG']","['Mouse Cancer Genetics Program, National Cancer Institute, Center for Cancer Research, Frederick, MD 21702, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural']",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Animals', 'Blotting, Northern', 'Blotting, Southern', 'Bone Marrow Cells/*physiology/virology', 'Cell Culture Techniques/methods', 'Cell Differentiation', '*Cell Line, Transformed', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*physiology/virology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/genetics', 'MDS1 and EVI1 Complex Locus Protein', 'Mice', 'Mutagenesis, Insertional/*genetics', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Proto-Oncogenes/genetics', 'Retroviridae/genetics', 'Transcription Factors/genetics', 'Transduction, Genetic', 'Zinc Fingers/genetics']",2005/08/20 09:00,2006/01/19 09:00,['2005/08/20 09:00'],"['2005/08/20 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/01/19 09:00 [medline]', '2005/08/20 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 2005 Dec 1;106(12):3932-9. doi: 10.1182/blood-2005-03-1113.

The source for growth factors used in the present study is conditioned medium collected from testicular cell cultures prepared from the testes of newborn males. Testes at this stage of development contain most growth factors required for the transformation of germ stem cells into differentiated gametes. When EBs were cultured in the conditioned medium, they developed into ovarian structures, which contained putative oocytes. The oocytes were surrounded by one to two layers of flattened cells and did not have a visible zona pellucida. However, oocyte-specific markers such as Fig-alpha and ZP3 were found expressed by the ovarian structures.

We show that the developing pancreas releases soluble factors responsible for in vitro endocrine pancreatic differentiation from embryonic stem cells (ESCs). A mouse D3 ESC line was transfected with a human insulin promoter/betageo/phosphoglycerate kinase-hygromycin-resistant construct. To direct differentiation, cells were cultured for 7 days to form embryoid bodies and then plated for an additional 7 days. During this 14-day period, besides eliminating leukemia inhibitory factor, cells were cultured in low serum concentration with the addition of conditioned media from embryonic day-16.5 pancreatic buds. Islet cell differentiation was studied by the following: (a) X-gal staining after neomycin selection, (b) BrdU (bro-modeoxyuridine) studies, (c) simple and double immunohistochemistry for insulin, C-peptide, and glucose transporter 2 (Glut-2), (d) reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction for insulin and pancreas duodenum homeobox 1 (PDX-1), (e) insulin and C-peptide content and secretion assays, (f) intraperitoneal glucose tolerance test, (g) electrophysiology (patch-clamp studies in inside-out configuration), and (h) transplantation of differentiated cells under the kidney capsule of streptozotocin-diabetic mice. The differentiated ESCs showed the following: changes in the mRNA levels of insulin and PDX-1; coexpression of insulin, C-peptide, and Glut-2; glucose and tolbutamide-dependent insulin and C-peptide release; K-channel activity regulated by ATP; and normalization of blood glucose levels after transplantation into diabetic mice and hyperglycemia after graft removal. In this study, we establish a battery of techniques that could be used together to properly characterize islet cell differentiation. Moreover, identification of factors released by the developing pancreas may be instrumental in engineering beta cells from stem cells.","['Vaca, Pilar', 'Martin, Franz', 'Vegara-Meseguer, Josefina M', 'Rovira, Juan M', 'Berna, Genoveva', 'Soria, Bernat']","['Vaca P', 'Martin F', 'Vegara-Meseguer JM', 'Rovira JM', 'Berna G', 'Soria B']","['Institute of Bioengineering, Miguel Hernandez University, San Juan de Alicante, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Stem Cells,"Stem cells (Dayton, Ohio)",9304532,IM,"['Adenosine Triphosphate/physiology', 'Animals', 'B-Lymphocytes/chemistry', 'C-Peptide/metabolism', '*Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Coculture Techniques/methods', 'Culture Media, Conditioned', 'Diabetes Mellitus, Experimental', 'Embryo, Mammalian/*cytology', 'Fetus/*physiology', 'Glucose/metabolism', 'Insulin/metabolism/*physiology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Pancreas/chemistry/*embryology/metabolism', 'Potassium Channels/metabolism', 'Proteins/metabolism', 'RNA/metabolism', 'Stem Cells/*physiology', 'Transfection']",2005/08/20 09:00,2006/08/11 09:00,['2005/08/20 09:00'],"['2005/08/20 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/08/11 09:00 [medline]', '2005/08/20 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Stem Cells. 2006 Feb;24(2):258-65. doi: 10.1634/stemcells.2005-0058.

The prostacyclin receptor (IP receptor) agonists iloprost, cicaprost, and carbacyclin have been useful for clarifying the role of the IP receptor signaling, since the endogenous ligand, prostacyclin, is very unstable. On the other hand, only a few IP receptor antagonists have been reported to date. Here, we characterized the biological activities of 2-[4-(1H-indol-4-yloxymethyl)-benzyloxycarbonylamino]-3-phenyl-propionic acid (compound A) in various in vitro systems. Compound A inhibited the accumulation of the second messenger cyclic AMP in the UMR-108 rat osteosarcoma cell line and primary cultured rat dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons in a concentration-dependent manner up to 10 microM, without affecting other eicosanoid receptors. Functionally, the IP receptor plays an important role in DRG neuron sensitization, which is measured by release of the neurotransmitter substance P. Although the effects of iloprost or Lys-bradykinin, an inflammatory peptide, alone on substance P release were limited, stimulation of the neurons with both these ligands induced substantial amounts of substance P release. This synergistic effect was suppressed by compound A. Collectively, these results suggest that compound A is a highly selective IP receptor antagonist that inhibits iloprost-induced sensitization of sensory neurons. Furthermore, these findings suggest that IP receptor antagonist administration may be effective for abnormal neural activities of unmyelinated sensory afferents. Compound A should prove useful for further investigations of the IP receptor in various biological processes.","['Nakae, Koichi', 'Saito, Kiyoko', 'Iino, Takashi', 'Yamamoto, Noriyuki', 'Wakabayashi, Mayo', 'Yoshikawa, Satoru', 'Matsushima, Satoshi', 'Miyashita, Hiroshi', 'Sugimoto, Hiromi', 'Kiba, Atushi', 'Gupta, Jung']","['Nakae K', 'Saito K', 'Iino T', 'Yamamoto N', 'Wakabayashi M', 'Yoshikawa S', 'Matsushima S', 'Miyashita H', 'Sugimoto H', 'Kiba A', 'Gupta J']","['Urology, Research Center Kyoto, Bayer Yakuhin Ltd., Kyoto, Japan. nakaek@bikaken.or.jp']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,J Pharmacol Exp Ther,The Journal of pharmacology and experimental therapeutics,0376362,IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'CHO Cells', 'Calcium/analysis/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cricetinae', 'Cyclic AMP/analysis', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Interactions', 'Ganglia, Spinal/cytology/drug effects/enzymology/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Iloprost/pharmacology', 'Inhibitory Concentration 50', 'K562 Cells', 'Kallidin/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/pathology', 'Molecular Structure', 'Neurons, Afferent/*drug effects/enzymology/metabolism', 'Osteosarcoma/pathology', 'Rats', 'Receptors, Epoprostenol/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'Substance P/*antagonists & inhibitors']",2005/08/20 09:00,2006/01/24 09:00,['2005/08/20 09:00'],"['2005/08/20 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/01/24 09:00 [medline]', '2005/08/20 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Pharmacol Exp Ther. 2005 Dec;315(3):1136-42. doi: 10.1124/jpet.105.091967.

Here we report that treatment with BAY 43-9006 results in marked cytochrome c and AIF release into the cytosol, caspase-9, -8, -7, and -3 activation, and apoptosis in human leukemia cells (U937, Jurkat, and K562). Pronounced apoptosis was also observed in blasts from patients with acute myeloid leukemia. These events were accompanied by ERK1/2 inactivation and caspase-independent down-regulation of Mcl-1. Inducible expression of a constitutively active MEK1 construct did not prevent Mcl-1 down-regulation, suggesting that this event is not related to MEK/ERK pathway inactivation. Furthermore, BAY 43-9006 did not induce major changes in Mcl-1 mRNA levels monitored by real-time PCR or Mcl-1 promoter activity demonstrated by luciferase reporter assays, but it did enhance Mcl-1 down-regulation in actinomycin D-treated cells. Inhibition of protein synthesis by cycloheximide or proteasome function with MG132 and pulse-chase studies with [35S]methionine demonstrated that BAY 43-9006 did not diminish Mcl-1 protein stability, nor did it enhance Mcl-1 ubiquitination, but instead markedly attenuated Mcl-1 translation in association with the rapid and potent dephosphorylation of the eIF4E translation initiation factor. Finally, ectopic expression of Mcl-1 in leukemic cells markedly inhibited BAY 43-9006-mediated cytochrome c cytosolic release, caspase-9, -7, and -3 activation, as well as cell death, indicating that Mcl-1 operates upstream of cytochrome c release and caspase activation. Together, these findings demonstrate that BAY 43-9006 mediates cell death in human leukemia cells, at least in part, through down-regulation of Mcl-1 via inhibition of translation.","['Rahmani, Mohamed', 'Davis, Eric Maynard', 'Bauer, Cheryl', 'Dent, Paul', 'Grant, Steven']","['Rahmani M', 'Davis EM', 'Bauer C', 'Dent P', 'Grant S']","['Departments of Medicine, Biochemistry, and Pharmacology, Virginia Commonwealth University, School of Medicine, Richmond, Virginia 23298.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', '*Apoptosis', 'Benzenesulfonates/*pharmacology', 'Caspase 3', 'Caspase 7', 'Caspase 9', 'Caspases/biosynthesis/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Chromatography', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', '*Down-Regulation', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Genes, Reporter', 'Humans', 'Immunoblotting', 'Immunoprecipitation', 'Jurkat Cells', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*biosynthesis', 'Niacinamide/analogs & derivatives', 'Phenylurea Compounds', 'Phosphorylation', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', '*Protein Biosynthesis', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*biosynthesis', 'Pyridines/*pharmacology', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Sorafenib', 'Subcellular Fractions/metabolism', 'Time Factors', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Transfection', 'U937 Cells', 'Ubiquitin/chemistry']",2005/08/20 09:00,2005/12/15 09:00,['2005/08/20 09:00'],"['2005/08/20 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/12/15 09:00 [medline]', '2005/08/20 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2005 Oct 21;280(42):35217-27. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M506551200.

The aim of the present study was to analyze the association between eight ABC-transporters (BCRP, MDR1, SMRP, MRP1, MRP2, MRP3, MRP4, and MRP5) and in vitro drug resistance. Leukemic cells from 52 children with previously untreated acute leukemia (ALL: n=37; AML: n=15) were analysed. The expression of the ABC-transporters was measured by TaqMan real-time PCR. In vitro drug resistance to cytarabine, vincristine, tioguanine, daunorubicin, etoposide, dexamethasone, and prednisone was analysed with methyl-thiazol-tetrazolium (MTT) assays.MDR1 was weakly associated with resistance to vincristine (p<0.05) in AML samples.

In vitro drug resistance was not associated with the simultaneous expression of a larger number of ABC-transporters.MTT assays are a widely used and validated method to analyse in vitro drug resistance but they may not be a useful tool to detect resistance which is caused by drug efflux in patient samples.

It was also found that sCD40 and sCD40L serum concentrations, which are dependent on the clinical stage and used therapy, are more sensitive tumor markers than TNF-alpha and its soluble receptor in patients with B-CLL treated with 2CdA and CMC.","['Jablonska, Ewa', 'Kiersnowska-Rogowska, Beata', 'Rogowski, Franciszek', 'Parfienczyk, Adam', 'Puzewska, Wioletta', 'Bukin, Maria']","['Jablonska E', 'Kiersnowska-Rogowska B', 'Rogowski F', 'Parfienczyk A', 'Puzewska W', 'Bukin M']","['Department of Immunology, Medical University of Bialystok, Poland. ewaj@amb.edu.pl']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,IM,"['CD40 Antigens/blood', 'CD40 Ligand/blood', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*blood/drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor/blood', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha', 'Tumor Necrosis Factors/*blood']",2005/08/20 09:00,2005/09/29 09:00,['2005/08/20 09:00'],"['2005/08/20 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/09/29 09:00 [medline]', '2005/08/20 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2005 Sep;46(9):1307-12. doi: 10.1080/10428190500158789.,,"['0 (CD40 Antigens)', '0 (Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factors)', '147205-72-9 (CD40 Ligand)']",,"['PX6G2QKM5482R323 [pii]', '10.1080/10428190500158789 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, we have determined whether there are abnormalities in cell cycle control in CLL by examining the three cyclin D isoforms in 43 patients and correlating the findings with clinical features. Cyclin D mRNA was measured by a sensitive RNase protection assay and the order of expression in CLL cells was D3 > D2 > D1. The mean cyclin D1 and D3 mRNA levels were 4 to 6-fold higher in CLL cells than in normal peripheral blood B cells. In contrast, the levels of cyclin D2 mRNA were similar in CLL and normal B cells. Expression of the cyclin D isoforms was two- to four-fold greater in normal T cells than B cells, and the order of expression for both cell types was D2 > D3 > D1. The relative overexpressions of cyclins D1 and D3 in CLL were unrelated to gene amplification, as assessed by Southern blotting, but structural changes in the genes were seen in four patients. Both cyclin D1 and D3 mRNA levels correlated positively with lymphocyte doubling time (LDT) and inversely with Rai stage and duration of disease. In addition, a significant correlation was observed between cyclin D mRNA levels and survival, with patients having high levels of cyclin D1, and to a lesser extent cyclin D3, mRNA having the best survival. Thus, cyclin D1 and D3 are relatively overexpressed in CLL cells and patients with higher levels have low stage disease, long LDT and prolonged survival. Further studies should evaluate the predictive value of cyclin D measurements in comparison to other prognostic markers in CLL.","['Paul, James T', 'Henson, Elizabeth S', 'Mai, Sabine', 'Mushinski, Frederic J', 'Cheang, Mary', 'Gibson, Spencer B', 'Johnston, James B']","['Paul JT', 'Henson ES', 'Mai S', 'Mushinski FJ', 'Cheang M', 'Gibson SB', 'Johnston JB']","['Manitoba Institute of Cell Biology, CancerCare Manitoba, Winnipeg, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cyclin D', 'Cyclins/*metabolism', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Protein Isoforms/analysis', 'RNA, Messenger', 'Survival Rate']",2005/08/20 09:00,2005/09/29 09:00,['2005/08/20 09:00'],"['2005/08/20 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/09/29 09:00 [medline]', '2005/08/20 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2005 Sep;46(9):1275-85. doi: 10.1080/10428190500158797.,,"['0 (Cyclin D)', '0 (Cyclins)', '0 (Protein Isoforms)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)']",,"['N572371237HQ5150 [pii]', '10.1080/10428190500158797 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

For many neoplasms, immunophenotype data of the neoplastic cells provide valuable information in clinical practice. However, the clinical values of immunophenotype data have not yet been firmly established for MDS. Since MDS blasts are not predominant in the bone marrow and peripheral blood, which makes reliable immunophenotyping of blasts difficult, we used a newly developed density-centrifugation reagent to generate blast-enriched MDS samples for phenotyping. The key findings of our study, which phenotyped blasts from 116 patients with MDS or acute leukemia transformed from MDS, were the following. (1) MDS blasts were usually CD34( + )CD38( + )HLA-DR( + )CD13( + )CD33( + )CD2(-)CD3(-)CD5(-)CD8(-)CD19(-)CD20(-) in flow cytometric analysis and often lacked myeloperoxidase in cytochemistry, regardless of the MDS subtype. (2) MDS blasts showed asynchronous expression of antigens (expression of both stem cell antigens and antigens of mature myeloid cells). (3) During disease progression of MDS, phenotypic clonal evolution (transition from blasts with a relatively mature phenotype to blasts with a more immature phenotype) occurred in at least some cases. (4) CD7-positivity was an independent variable associated with a short survival in MDS. Further studies of blast immunophenotypes will deepen our understanding of MDS and hopefully improve the clinical approach to these intractable disorders.","['Ogata, Kiyoyuki', 'Yoshida, Yataro']","['Ogata K', 'Yoshida Y']","['Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, Nippon Medical School, Tokyo, Japan. ogata@nms.ac.jp']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,IM,"['Antigens, CD/*analysis', 'Antigens, CD34/analysis', 'Disease Progression', 'Humans', '*Immunophenotyping', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*immunology', 'Prognosis']",2005/08/20 09:00,2005/09/29 09:00,['2005/08/20 09:00'],"['2005/08/20 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/09/29 09:00 [medline]', '2005/08/20 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2005 Sep;46(9):1269-74. doi: 10.1080/10428190500142155.,,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, CD34)']",45,"['H54770002M2X596J [pii]', '10.1080/10428190500142155 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In B-type chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL), p53 gene mutations occur in a subset of patients and are associated with impaired survival and drug resistance. Here, we address the functional relevance of the codon 72 single nucleotide (SNP) polymorphism for cell death sensitivity following exposure to clinically employed cytotoxic drugs and gamma-irradiation. METHODS: 138 B-CLL samples were analysed by SSCP-PCR and sequencing for single nucleotide polymorphism at codon 72 of the p53 gene. The in vitro cytotoxicity assay (DiSC-assay) was performed with 7 drugs (chlorambucil, mafosfamide, fludarabine phosphate, methylprednisolone, doxorubicin, vincristine) or gamma-irradiation. RESULTS: Of the 138 B-CLL samples, 9 samples were homozygous for proline (Pro/Pro), 78 samples homozygous for arginine (Arg/Arg), and 49 samples heterozygous (Arg/Pro). No differences were found for patient survival and cell death triggered by 7 cytotoxic drugs or gamma-irradiation. CONCLUSION: These data indicate that polymorphic variants of p53 codon 72 are not clinically relevant for apoptosis induction or patient survival in B-CLL.","['Sturm, Isrid', 'Bosanquet, Andrew G', 'Hummel, Michael', 'Dorken, Bernd', 'Daniel, Peter T']","['Sturm I', 'Bosanquet AG', 'Hummel M', 'Dorken B', 'Daniel PT']","['Department of Hematology, Oncology and Tumor Immunology, University Medical Center Charite, Campus Berlin-Buch, Berlin, Germany. isrid.sturm@charite.de']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,BMC Cancer,BMC cancer,100967800,IM,"['Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis', 'Arginine/genetics', 'Chlorambucil/pharmacology', '*Codon', 'Cyclophosphamide/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', 'Doxorubicin/pharmacology', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Female', 'Gamma Rays', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', '*Genes, p53', 'Homozygote', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*diagnosis/*genetics/mortality', 'Male', 'Methylprednisolone/pharmacology', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', '*Polymorphism, Genetic', 'Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide', 'Polymorphism, Single-Stranded Conformational', 'Prognosis', 'Proline/genetics', 'Vidarabine Phosphate/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Vincristine/pharmacology']",2005/08/20 09:00,2006/02/28 09:00,['2005/08/20 09:00'],"['2005/05/06 00:00 [received]', '2005/08/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2005/08/20 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/02/28 09:00 [medline]', '2005/08/20 09:00 [entrez]']",epublish,BMC Cancer. 2005 Aug 18;5:105. doi: 10.1186/1471-2407-5-105.,,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Codon)', '106XV160TZ (Vidarabine Phosphate)', '18D0SL7309 (Chlorambucil)', '1X9VK9O1SC (fludarabine phosphate)', '5970HH9923 (mafosfamide)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', '94ZLA3W45F (Arginine)', '9DLQ4CIU6V (Proline)', 'X4W7ZR7023 (Methylprednisolone)']",,"['1471-2407-5-105 [pii]', '10.1186/1471-2407-5-105 [doi]']",,,,20050818,PMC1208864,,,,,,,,,,,

As regulatory T cells (Treg cells) express CD4+ and CD25+ molecules and possess potent immune response suppressive activity, we investigated a possible link between ATLL cells and Treg cells. In primary ATLL cells, the expression levels of the Treg cell marker molecules Foxp3 and glucocorticoid-induced tumor necrosis factor receptor family related protein (GITR) were significantly higher than in those from healthy adults. Furthermore, ATLL cells are unresponsive in vitro to concanavalin A stimulation and suppress the proliferation of normal T cells. GITR mRNA expression was induced by the HTLV-I transactivator Tax, and GITR promoter analyses revealed that this induction depends on the kappaB site from -431 bp to -444 bp upstream of the putative transcription site. Taken together, ATLL cells may originate from HTLV-I-infected Treg cells, and GITR seems to be involved in the progression to ATLL.","['Kohno, Tomoko', 'Yamada, Yasuaki', 'Akamatsu, Norihiko', 'Kamihira, Simeru', 'Imaizumi, Yoshitaka', 'Tomonaga, Masao', 'Matsuyama, Toshifumi']","['Kohno T', 'Yamada Y', 'Akamatsu N', 'Kamihira S', 'Imaizumi Y', 'Tomonaga M', 'Matsuyama T']","['Division of Cytokine Signaling, Department of Molecular Microbiology and Immunology, Nagasaki University, Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences, 1-12-4 Sakamoto, Nagasaki 852-8523, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Cancer Sci,Cancer science,101168776,IM,"['Adult', 'Cell Division', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Concanavalin A', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics', 'Forkhead Transcription Factors', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Viral', 'Gene Products, tax/metabolism', 'Glucocorticoid-Induced TNFR-Related Protein', 'Humans', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/genetics/*immunology/pathology', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Receptors, Nerve Growth Factor/genetics', 'Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor/genetics', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology']",2005/08/20 09:00,2005/10/28 09:00,['2005/08/20 09:00'],"['2005/08/20 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/10/28 09:00 [medline]', '2005/08/20 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Sci. 2005 Aug;96(8):527-33. doi: 10.1111/j.1349-7006.2005.00080.x.,,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (FOXP3 protein, human)', '0 (Forkhead Transcription Factors)', '0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (Glucocorticoid-Induced TNFR-Related Protein)', '0 (Receptors, Nerve Growth Factor)', '0 (Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor)', '0 (TNFRSF18 protein, human)', '11028-71-0 (Concanavalin A)']",,"['CAS080 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1349-7006.2005.00080.x [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The causative agents of TSP/HAM are HTLV-1 and, possibly, its cosmopolitan variant, human T leukemia virus type 2 (HTLV-2). Among HTLV-1- or HTLV-2-monoinfected individuals, the estimated lifetime risk for development of TSP/HAM is <2%. However, it has been suggested that HIV/HTLV coinfection may increase the risk for development of TSP/HAM. METHODS: A total of 2239 human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients were tested for HTLV-1 and HTLV-2 infection at the New Orleans Outpatient Clinic (Louisiana) during the period 1991-1998. HTLV-1-infected patients with suspected myelopathy were referred for additional evaluation. RESULTS: Four cases of TSP/HAM (9.7%) were identified among 41 individuals with Western blot-confirmed HTLV-1 infection. The diagnosis was confirmed with use of molecular diagnostic assays and viral isolation. No TSP/HAM cases were identified among 65 patients with HIV-HTLV-2 coinfection. An additional patient with HIV-HTLV-1 coinfection also received a diagnosis of TSP/HAM at the New Orleans Veteran's Affairs HIV Outpatient Clinic (Louisiana). All patients had normal CD4+ T cell counts at the time of diagnosis. CONCLUSIONS: Given the high rates of HIV-HTLV coinfection in the United States, a heightened suspicion for TSP/HAM should be considered in HIV-infected patients who present with normal CD4+ T cell counts and myelopathy in the absence of other acquired immunodeficiency syndrome-defining conditions.","['Beilke, Mark A', 'Japa, Shanker', 'Moeller-Hadi, Christiane', 'Martin-Schild, Sheryl']","['Beilke MA', 'Japa S', 'Moeller-Hadi C', 'Martin-Schild S']","['Tulane University Health Sciences Center, New Orleans, Louisiana 70112, USA. mabeilke@tulane.edu']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Clin Infect Dis,Clinical infectious diseases : an official publication of the Infectious Diseases Society of America,9203213,IM,"['Adult', 'HIV Infections/*complications', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*isolation & purification', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Paraparesis, Tropical Spastic/*epidemiology/*virology', 'Seroepidemiologic Studies']",2005/08/19 09:00,2006/09/26 09:00,['2005/08/19 09:00'],"['2005/04/26 00:00 [received]', '2005/05/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2005/08/19 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/09/26 09:00 [medline]', '2005/08/19 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Clin Infect Dis. 2005 Sep 15;41(6):e57-63. doi: 10.1086/432890.

A total of 303 children were diagnosed with AML, of whom 209 were eligible for this report. The first study was the AML-82 protocol. Results were inferior (5-year probability of overall survival (pOS) 31%) to other available regimes. Study AML-87 was based on the BFM-87 protocol, with prophylactic cranial irradiation in high-risk patients only, and without maintenance therapy. This led to a higher cumulative incidence of relapse than that reported by the Berlin-Frankfurt-Munster (BFM), but survival was similar (5-year pOS 47%), suggesting successful retrieval at relapse. The subsequent study AML-92/94 consisted of a modified BFM-93 protocol, that is, without maintenance therapy and prophylactic cranial irradiation. However, all patients were to be transplanted (auto- or allogeneic), although compliance was poor.

In order to gain insight into the transcriptional consequences of this fusion, microarray-based comparison of CALM-AF10+ vs CALM-AF10- T-ALL was performed. This analysis showed upregulation of HOXA5, HOXA9, HOXA10 and BMI1 in the CALM-AF10+ cases. Microarray results were validated by quantitative RT-PCR on an independent group of T-ALL and compared to mixed lineage leukemia-translocated acute leukemias (MLL-t AL). The overexpression of HOXA genes was associated with overexpression of its cofactor MEIS1 in CALM-AF10+ T-ALL, reaching levels of expression similar to those observed in MLL-t AL. Consequently, CALM-AF10+ T-ALL and MLL-t AL share a specific HOXA overexpression, indicating they activate common oncogenic pathways. In addition, BMI1, located close to AF10 breakpoint, was overexpressed only in CALM-AF10+ T-ALL and not in MLL-t AL. BMI1 controls cellular proliferation through suppression of the tumor suppressors encoded by the CDKN2A locus. This locus, often deleted in T-ALL, was conserved in CALM-AF10+ T-ALL. This suggests that decreased CDKN2A activity, as a result of BMI1 overexpression, contributes to leukemogenesis in CALM-AF10+ T-ALL. We propose to define a HOXA+ leukemia group composed of at least MLL-t, CALM-AF10 and HOXA-t AL, which may benefit from adapted management.","['Dik, W A', 'Brahim, W', 'Braun, C', 'Asnafi, V', 'Dastugue, N', 'Bernard, O A', 'van Dongen, J J M', 'Langerak, A W', 'Macintyre, E A', 'Delabesse, E']","['Dik WA', 'Brahim W', 'Braun C', 'Asnafi V', 'Dastugue N', 'Bernard OA', 'van Dongen JJ', 'Langerak AW', 'Macintyre EA', 'Delabesse E']","['Department of Immunology, Erasmus MC, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'Child', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Homeodomain Proteins/*biosynthesis/physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*genetics/*physiopathology', 'Nuclear Proteins/*biosynthesis/physiology', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*biosynthesis', 'Polycomb Repressive Complex 1', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*biosynthesis/physiology', 'Repressor Proteins/*biosynthesis/physiology', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Up-Regulation']",2005/08/19 09:00,2005/11/16 09:00,['2005/08/19 09:00'],"['2005/08/19 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/11/16 09:00 [medline]', '2005/08/19 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2005 Nov;19(11):1948-57. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2403891.,,"['0 (AF10-CALM fusion protein, human)', '0 (BMI1 protein, human)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '157907-48-7 (HoxA protein)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Polycomb Repressive Complex 1)']",,"['2403891 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.leu.2403891 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In 1994, a modification was made: the high-risk patients (>5% blasts in bone marrow on day 15 of therapy and all M5 cases) received two additional cycles with intermediate-dose cytarabine (ID-ARAC). This led to a nonsignificant improvement in the 5-year event-free survival (EFS) rate from 32 to 36%. A new treatment protocol employing idarubicin in place of daunorubicin was introduced in 1998 and produced better initial responses, increase in the number of patients attaining remission after induction therapy and proportional increase of standard-risk patients. The probability of 5-year EFS (pEFS) for the whole group of patients increased from 36 to 47%. In standard- and high-risk groups, the 5-year pEFS was 62 and 33%, respectively. The probability of 5-year disease-free survival was 58% in the whole group, and there were no differences between risk groups.

During cell cycle progression from the mid- to late G1 phase, mammalian cells traverse the restriction point, a transition from mitogen dependence to mitogen independence, regulated by retinoblastoma protein (Rb). Different cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) sequentially phosphorylate and inactivate Rb, which is associated by a change in Rb's nuclear affinity and activation of E2F transcription. Here, we show by in vitro kinase assays that ALL extracts contained CDK2 catalytic activity. When liberation of Rb from cell nuclei was tested by immune precipitation of differential cell extractions and Western blot analysis, little Rb was associated with the nuclear compartment. Together with the immunocytochemical analysis at a single cell level that Rb was phosphorylated at serine 612 and threonine 821, sites known to be phosphorylated by CDK2, the data indicated the presence of CDK2 catalytic activity and loss of Rb's nuclear affinity in ALL cells.

However, translation of these findings to the clinic is limited by calcemic effects of deltanoids. Strategies to overcome this problem include combination of deltanoids with other compounds to induce differentiation at lower, noncalcemic, deltanoid concentrations. We previously showed that either carnosic acid, an antioxidant, or SB202190, a p38 MAPK inhibitor, increase the potency of 1,25D3 in the HL60 cell line. Here, we report that simultaneous addition of both these agents further increases differentiation potency of deltanoids in this cell line and in freshly obtained leukemic cells ex vivo. Activity of MAPK pathways showed that increased differentiation was associated with enhanced activity of JNK pathway in all responding cell subtypes. Our studies suggest that patients with CML or AML subtypes M2 and M4, but not M1, M3 or M4eo, are particularly suitable for this combination therapy.

Since it has been shown that alterations in innate immune pathways contribute to the risk for serious infections, we analyzed well-characterized variants in innate immune genes (TNF, IL6, IL8, MPO, CHIT, FCGR2A, TLR2, and TLR4) to determine their possible contribution to infectious complications during therapy for pediatric AML. The study population consisted of 168 North European Caucasian children enrolled on the clinical trial AML-BFM 93. We found an association between Gram-negative bacterial infection and common, functional variants in two genes, IL6 and CHIT. The risk for infection was significantly higher in children with the G allele in the IL6 promoter at -174 bp (P=0.026) and in patients with the H allele of CHIT (P=0.033).

Previous investigations restricted the mechanism of this synergism to the modulation and/or degradation of PML-RARalpha oncoprotein through distinct pathways. In this study, using several ATRA maturation-resistant APL cell lines, we demonstrate in vitro that the success of ATRA/As2O3 treatment in APL pathology can be explained, at least in part, by a synergistic effect of these two drugs in triggering downregulation of telomerase efficient enough to cause telomere shortening and subsequent cell death.

Some partners of FGFR1 are centrosomal proteins. The corresponding oncogenic fusion kinases are targeted to the centrosome.

There are concerns for the possible genotoxicity and carcinogenicity of RP when it is exposed to sunlight. To evaluate the photomutagenicity of RP in cells when exposed to ultraviolet A (UVA) light, L5178Y/Tk+/- mouse lymphoma cells were treated with different doses of RP alone/or in the presence of UVA light. Treatment of the cells with RP alone at the dose range of 25-100 microg/ml did not increase mutant frequencies (MFs) over the negative control, whereas treatment of cells with 1-25 microg/ml RP under UVA light (82.8 mJ/cm2/min for 30 min) produced a dose-dependent mutation induction. The mean induced MF (392 x 10(-6)) for treatment with 25 microg/ml RP under UVA exposure was about threefold higher than that for UVA alone (122 x 10(-6)), a synergistic effect. To elucidate the underlying mechanism of action, we examined the mutants for loss of heterozygosity (LOH) at four microsatellite loci spanning the entire chromosome 11, on which the Tk gene is located. The mutational spectrum for the RP + UVA treatment was significantly different from the negative control, but not significantly different from UVA exposure alone. Ninety four percent of the mutants from RP + UVA treatment lost the Tk+ allele, and 91% of the deleted sequences extended more than 6 cM in chromosome length, indicating clastogenic events affecting a large segment of the chromosome. These results suggest that RP is photomutagenic in combination with UVA exposure in mouse lymphoma cells, with a clastogenic mode-of-action.","['Mei, Nan', 'Xia, Qingsu', 'Chen, Ling', 'Moore, Martha M', 'Fu, Peter P', 'Chen, Tao']","['Mei N', 'Xia Q', 'Chen L', 'Moore MM', 'Fu PP', 'Chen T']","['Division of Genetic and Reproductive Toxicology, National Center for Toxicological Research, FDA, Jefferson, Arkansas 72079, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",United States,Toxicol Sci,Toxicological sciences : an official journal of the Society of Toxicology,9805461,IM,"['Animals', 'Anticarcinogenic Agents/radiation effects/*toxicity', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'DNA, Neoplasm/drug effects', 'Diterpenes', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Leukemia L5178/*drug therapy/genetics/metabolism', 'Loss of Heterozygosity/genetics', 'Mice', 'Mutagenicity Tests/methods', 'Mutagens/*toxicity', 'Photolysis', 'Retinyl Esters', 'Thymidine Kinase/genetics', 'Ultraviolet Rays', 'Vitamin A/*analogs & derivatives/radiation effects/toxicity']",2005/08/19 09:00,2005/11/16 09:00,['2005/08/19 09:00'],"['2005/08/19 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/11/16 09:00 [medline]', '2005/08/19 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Toxicol Sci. 2005 Nov;88(1):142-9. doi: 10.1093/toxsci/kfi291.

Urodele limb regeneration is a powerful model in which to study these mechanisms. Following limb amputation, blastema cells interpret the proximal-most positional identity in the stump to reproduce missing parts faithfully. Classical experiments showed the ability of retinoic acid (RA) to proximalize blastema positional values. Meis homeobox genes are involved in RA-dependent specification of proximal cell identity during limb development. To understand the molecular basis for specifying proximal positional identities during regeneration, we isolated the axolotl Meis homeobox family. Axolotl Meis genes are RA-regulated during both regeneration and embryonic limb development. During limb regeneration, Meis overexpression relocates distal blastema cells to more proximal locations, whereas Meis knockdown inhibits RA proximalization of limb blastemas. Meis genes are thus crucial targets of RA proximalizing activity on blastema cells.","['Mercader, Nadia', 'Tanaka, Elly M', 'Torres, Miguel']","['Mercader N', 'Tanaka EM', 'Torres M']","['Departamento de Inmunologia y Oncologia, Centro Nacional de Biotecnologia/CSIC, Campus de Cantoblanco, E-28049 Madrid, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Development,"Development (Cambridge, England)",8701744,IM,"['Ambystoma mexicanum/*physiology', 'Amputation', 'Animals', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'DNA Primers', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics', 'Electroporation', 'Forelimb/*physiology', '*Gene Expression Regulation', 'Homeodomain Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'In Situ Hybridization', 'Myeloid Ecotropic Viral Integration Site 1 Protein', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Pre-B-Cell Leukemia Transcription Factor 1', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics', 'Regeneration/*physiology', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Tretinoin/metabolism']",2005/08/19 09:00,2006/03/15 09:00,['2005/08/19 09:00'],"['2005/08/19 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/03/15 09:00 [medline]', '2005/08/19 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Development. 2005 Sep;132(18):4131-42. doi: 10.1242/dev.01976.

This review describes our present understanding of the underlying mechanisms of SIR established by three characteristic retroviruses: Murine Leukaemia Virus (MuLV), Foamy Virus (FV), and Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV). In addition, SIR is discussed with respect to HIV superinfection of humans. MuLV resistant mice exhibit two genetic resistance traits related to SIR. The cellular Fv4 gene expresses an Env related protein that establishes resistance against MuLV infection. Another mouse gene (Fv1) mediates MuLV resistance by expression of a sequence that is distantly related to Gag and that blocks the viral infection after the reverse transcription step. FVs induce two distinct mechanisms of superinfection resistance. First, expression of the Env protein results in SIR, probably by occupancy of the cellular receptors for FV entry. Second, an increase in the concentration of the viral Bet (Between-env-and-LTR-1-and-2) protein reduces proviral FV gene expression by inhibition of the transcriptional activator protein Tas (Transactivator of spumaviruses). In contrast to SIR in FV and MuLV infection, the underlying mechanism of SIR in HIV-infected cells is poorly understood. CD4 receptor down-modulation, a major characteristic of HIV-infected cells, has been proposed to be the main mechanism of SIR against HIV, but data have been contradictory. Several recent studies report the occurrence of HIV superinfection in humans; an event associated with the generation of recombinant HIV strains and possibly with increased disease progression. The role of SIR in protecting patients from HIV superinfection has not been studied so far. The phenomenon of SIR may also be important in the protection of primates that are vaccinated with live attenuated simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) against pathogenic SIV variants. As primate models of SIV infection closely resemble HIV infection, a better knowledge of SIR-induced mechanisms could contribute to the development of an HIV vaccine or other antiviral strategies.","['Nethe, Micha', 'Berkhout, Ben', 'van der Kuyl, Antoinette C']","['Nethe M', 'Berkhout B', 'van der Kuyl AC']","['Dept. of Human Retrovirology, Academic Medical Centre, University of Amsterdam, Meibergdreef 15, 1105AZ Amsterdam, The Netherlands. michanethe@hotmail.com']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Retrovirology,Retrovirology,101216893,IM,"['Animals', 'CD4 Antigens/physiology', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Gene Products, env/physiology', 'HIV Infections/*immunology', 'Humans', '*Leukemia Virus, Murine', 'Membrane Proteins/genetics/physiology', 'Proteins/genetics/physiology', 'Retroviridae Infections/*immunology', 'Retroviridae Proteins/physiology', '*Spumavirus', 'TRPV Cation Channels/physiology', '*Viral Interference']",2005/08/19 09:00,2006/07/27 09:00,['2005/08/19 09:00'],"['2005/04/18 00:00 [received]', '2005/08/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2005/08/19 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/07/27 09:00 [medline]', '2005/08/19 09:00 [entrez]']",epublish,Retrovirology. 2005 Aug 18;2:52. doi: 10.1186/1742-4690-2-52.,,"['0 (CD4 Antigens)', '0 (Fv1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Fv4 protein, mouse)', '0 (Gene Products, env)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (Retroviridae Proteins)', '0 (TRPV Cation Channels)', '0 (TRPV6 channel)', '0 (bet protein, human foamy virus)']",114,"['1742-4690-2-52 [pii]', '10.1186/1742-4690-2-52 [doi]']",,,,20050818,PMC1224871,,,,,,,,,,,

PROCEDURE: We analyzed data from 57 survivors (26 male, 52 Caucasian) who underwent two serial quantitative computed tomography (QCT) studies of BMD. Using multiple linear regression, we evaluated the association of BMD change with demographic variables, treatment history, hormone therapy, exercise, and tobacco and alcohol use. RESULTS: The median age was 3.4 years (range, 0.9-17.4 years) at diagnosis of ALL; the median age at the first QCT (Study I) was 15.0 years (range, 10.6-31.0 years) and at the second QCT (Study II) was 18.2 years (range, 14.2-35.3 years). Mean height increased 4.7 cm and mean weight increased 8.8 kg between Studies I and II. While the mean BMD increased 9.33 mg/cc (P = 0.003), the BMD Z-score increased only slightly (0.21 SD, P = 0.035). Cortical bone density increased significantly (approximately 25.3 mg/cc; P = 0.001), but the ratio of trabecular to cortical BMD decreased significantly (P = 0.045). Factors independently associated with unfavorable BMD changes included older age at diagnosis (P = 0.001), female sex (P = 0.018), and nutritional supplementation (0.032). Alcohol (P = 0.009) was an unfavorable factor in a univariable analysis. CONCLUSIONS: Bone mineral accretion during adolescence is attenuated in childhood ALL survivors by a comparative deficit in trabecular versus cortical bone deposition. BMD is influenced favorably by exercise in early adolescence and unfavorably by the use of nutritional supplements and alcohol. These results provide new information about behavioral factors that affect bone accrual in survivors of childhood ALL and warrant definitive evaluation in a larger cohort.","['Kaste, Sue C', 'Rai, Shesh N', 'Fleming, Katherine', 'McCammon, Elizabeth A', 'Tylavsky, Frances A', 'Danish, Robert K', 'Rose, Susan R', 'Sitter, Cheri D', 'Pui, Ching-Hon', 'Hudson, Melissa M']","['Kaste SC', 'Rai SN', 'Fleming K', 'McCammon EA', 'Tylavsky FA', 'Danish RK', 'Rose SR', 'Sitter CD', 'Pui CH', 'Hudson MM']","[""Department of Radiological Sciences (Division of Diagnostic Imaging), St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee 38105, USA. sue.kaste@stjude.org""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', '*Bone Density', 'Bone Diseases, Metabolic/*epidemiology/etiology/prevention & control', 'Child', 'Cohort Studies', 'Female', 'Health Behavior', 'Humans', 'Linear Models', 'Male', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*complications', 'Risk Factors', '*Survivors/statistics & numerical data', 'United States/epidemiology']",2005/08/18 09:00,2006/02/17 09:00,['2005/08/18 09:00'],"['2005/08/18 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/02/17 09:00 [medline]', '2005/08/18 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2006 Jan;46(1):77-87. doi: 10.1002/pbc.20553.,"['R25 CA023944/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA-20180/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA-21765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,['10.1002/pbc.20553 [doi]'],,,,,,,['Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2006 Jan;46(1):1.

To assess the role of 8-oxoguanine glycosylase (OGG1) in the cellular defense mechanism in a specific DNA repair defect background, we set out to determine the expression pattern of base excision repair genes and other cellular genes not involved in the base excision pathway in OGG1-deficient human KG-1 cells after ionizing radiation exposure. KG-1 cells have lost OGG1 activity due to a homozygous mutation of Arg229Gln. Gene expression alterations were monitored at 4, 8, 12 and 24 hr in 2 Gy irradiated cells. Large-scale gene expression profiling was assessed with DNA microarray technology. Gene expression analysis identified a number of ionizing radiation-responsive genes, including several novel genes. There were 2 peaks of radiation-induced gene induction or repression: one at 8 hr and the other at 24 hr. Overall the number of downregulated genes was higher than the number of upregulated genes. The highest number of downregulated genes was at 8 hr postirradiation. Genes corresponding to cellular, physiologic, developmental and extracellular processes were identified. The highest number of radiation-induced genes belonged to the signal transduction category, followed by genes involved in transcription and response to stress.

Curcumin (diferuloylmethane), the major pigment of the spice turmeric, can be potentially effective by promoting cell apoptosis. Here we examined whether curcumin is effective in the treatment of ATL. Curcumin prevented cell growth of HTLV-I-infected T-cell lines and primary ATL cells but not of normal peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Curcumin induced cell cycle arrest by reducing the expression of cyclin D1, Cdk1 and Cdc25C and apoptosis by reducing the expression of XIAP and survivin. Most of these genes are known to be regulated by NF-kappaB, which plays a critical role in oncogenesis by HTLV-I. Curcumin suppressed constitutive active NF-kappaB of HTLV-I-infected T-cell lines and primary ATL cells by inhibiting phosphorylation of IkappaBalpha. Curcumin also inhibited Tax-induced NF-kappaB transcriptional activity. However, curcumin-induced suppression of cell growth did not correlate with Tax expression level. Curcumin inhibited the growth of HTLV-I-infected T-cell tumors implanted subcutaneously in SCID mice.

Here, we show that bone marrow mononuclear cells (BMMCs) and purified CD34+ cells from patients with low-grade/early-stage MDS (refractory anemia/refractory anemia with ring sideroblasts [RA/RARS]) have low levels of NF-kappaB activity in nuclear extracts comparable with normal marrow, while patients with RA with excess blasts (RAEB) show significantly increased levels of activity (P = .008). Exogenous TNF-alpha enhanced NF-kappaB nuclear translocation in MDS BMMCs above baseline levels. Treatment with arsenic trioxide (ATO; 2-200 microM) inhibited NF-kappaB activity in normal marrow, primary MDS, and ML1 cells, even in the presence of exogenous TNF-alpha (20 ng/mL), and down-regulated NF-kappaB-dependent antiapoptotic proteins, B-cell leukemia XL (Bcl-XL), Bcl-2, X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis (XIAP), and Fas-associated death domain (FADD)-like interleukin-1beta-converting enzyme (FLICE) inhibitory protein (FLIP), leading to apoptosis. However, overexpression of FLIP resulted in increased NF-kappaB activity and rendered ML1 cells resistant to ATO-induced apoptosis. These data are consistent with the observed up-regulation of FLIP and resistance to apoptosis with advanced MDS, where ATO as a single agent may show only limited efficacy. However, the data also suggest that combinations of ATO with agents that interfere with other pathways, such as FLIP autoamplification via NF-kappaB, may have considerable therapeutic activity.","['Kerbauy, Daniella M B', 'Lesnikov, Vladimir', 'Abbasi, Nissa', 'Seal, Sudeshna', 'Scott, Bart', 'Deeg, H Joachim']","['Kerbauy DM', 'Lesnikov V', 'Abbasi N', 'Seal S', 'Scott B', 'Deeg HJ']","['Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, 1100 Fairview Avenue N, D1-100, PO Box 19024, Seattle, WA, 98109-1024, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*physiology', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/metabolism', 'Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals/*pharmacology', 'Blotting, Western', 'Bone Marrow Cells/drug effects/metabolism', 'CASP8 and FADD-Like Apoptosis Regulating Protein', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Etanercept', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Glutathione/drug effects/metabolism', 'Growth Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin G/pharmacology', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/metabolism', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/drug therapy/*metabolism/pathology', 'NF-kappa B/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Oxides/*pharmacology', 'Protein Transport/drug effects', 'Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/metabolism']",2005/08/18 09:00,2006/01/19 09:00,['2005/08/18 09:00'],"['2005/08/18 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/01/19 09:00 [medline]', '2005/08/18 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 2005 Dec 1;106(12):3917-25. doi: 10.1182/blood-2005-04-1424.

All patients received identical induction therapy, and 91% achieved complete remission (CR). Patients 50 years of age or younger with a compatible sibling were assigned to undergo allogeneic transplantation; the others were randomly assigned to autologous transplantation or to consolidation/maintenance therapy for 2.5 years. Patients who did not achieve CR after induction had an overall survival rate of 5% compared with 45% for patients who achieved CR. Factors at diagnosis predictive of overall survival and disease-free survival were age (P = .001), white blood cell count less than 30 x 10(9)/L for B lineage or less than 100 x 10(9)/L for T lineage (P = .001) and immunophenotype, T lineage versus B lineage (P = .001). The data demonstrate that achieving CR with induction therapy is indispensable for long-term survival in adult patients with ALL. Furthermore, with a response rate greater than 90%, the induction regimen was highly efficacious as remission-inducing therapy. This large database has validated several previously identified independent prognostic factors in ALL, such as age, white blood cell count at presentation, cytogenetics, and immunophenotype. However, the achievement of CR within 4 weeks does not appear to be an independent prognostic factor.","['Rowe, Jacob M', 'Buck, Georgina', 'Burnett, Alan K', 'Chopra, Raj', 'Wiernik, Peter H', 'Richards, Susan M', 'Lazarus, Hillard M', 'Franklin, Ian M', 'Litzow, Mark R', 'Ciobanu, Niculae', 'Prentice, H Grant', 'Durrant, Jill', 'Tallman, Martin S', 'Goldstone, Anthony H']","['Rowe JM', 'Buck G', 'Burnett AK', 'Chopra R', 'Wiernik PH', 'Richards SM', 'Lazarus HM', 'Franklin IM', 'Litzow MR', 'Ciobanu N', 'Prentice HG', 'Durrant J', 'Tallman MS', 'Goldstone AH']","['Department of Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation, Rambam Medical Center and Technion, Israel Institute of Technology, Haifa 31096, Israel. rowe@jimmy.harvard.edu']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Randomized Controlled Trial']",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Philadelphia Chromosome', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/mortality/*therapy', 'Prognosis', 'Remission Induction', 'Survival Analysis', 'Treatment Outcome']",2005/08/18 09:00,2006/01/19 09:00,['2005/08/18 09:00'],"['2005/08/18 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/01/19 09:00 [medline]', '2005/08/18 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 2005 Dec 1;106(12):3760-7. doi: 10.1182/blood-2005-04-1623.

This protein consists of N-terminal MN1 sequences, a transcriptional coactivator fused to C-terminal TEL sequences, an ETS (E26 transformation-specific) transcription factor. Enforced expression of MN1-TEL in multipotent hematopoietic progenitors in knock-in mice perturbed growth and differentiation of myeloid as well as lymphoid cells. Depending on obligatory secondary mutations, these mice developed T-cell lympholeukemia. Here we addressed the role of MN1-TEL in myeloid leukemogenesis using the same mouse model. Expression of MN1-TEL enhanced the growth of myeloid progenitors in an interleukin 3/stem cell factor (IL-3/SCF)-dependent manner in vitro whereas 10% of MN1-TEL-expressing mice developed altered myelopoiesis with severe anemia after long latency. Coexpression of MN1-TEL and IL-3, but not SCF, rapidly caused a fatal myeloproliferative disease rather than acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Because MN1-TEL+ AML patient cells overexpress HOXA9 (homeobox A9), we tested the effect of coexpression of MN1-TEL and HOXA9 in mice and found that 90% of MN1-TEL+/HOXA9+ mice developed AML much more rapidly than control HOXA9+ mice. Thus, the leukemogenic effect of MN1-TEL in our knock-in mice is pleiotropic, and the type of secondary mutation determines disease outcome.","['Kawagoe, Hiroyuki', 'Grosveld, Gerard C']","['Kawagoe H', 'Grosveld GC']","[""Department of Genetics and Tumor Cell Biology, St Jude Children's Research Hospital, 332 North Lauderdale, Memphis, TN 38105, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cytokines/pharmacology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Homeodomain Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/*metabolism/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Myeloid Progenitor Cells/cytology/drug effects/metabolism', 'Oncogene Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-ets/genetics/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc/metabolism', 'Repressor Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Trans-Activators', 'Transgenes/genetics', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins']",2005/08/18 09:00,2006/01/07 09:00,['2005/08/18 09:00'],"['2005/08/18 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/01/07 09:00 [medline]', '2005/08/18 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 2005 Dec 15;106(13):4269-77. doi: 10.1182/blood-2005-04-1679.

Both mutations were associated with higher white blood cell (WBC) count at presentation; 75% of the patients with WBC counts of 10 x 10(9)/L or greater had mutant FLT3. FLT3/ITDs were correlated with M3v subtype (P < .001), bcr3 PML breakpoint (P < .001), and expression of reciprocal RARA-PML transcripts (P = .01). Microarray analysis revealed differences in expression profiles among patients with FLT3/ITD, D835/I836, and wild-type FLT3.

In in vitro differentiation assays using primary APL blasts (n = 6), the FLT3 inhibitor CEP-701 had a greater effect on cell survival/proliferation in FLT3/ITD+ cells, but this inhibition was reduced in the presence of ATRA. Furthermore, in the presence of CEP-701, ATRA-induced differentiation was reduced in FLT3/ITD+ cells.

NS-187 is also at least 10 times as effective as imatinib in suppressing the growth of Bcr-Abl-bearing tumors and markedly extends the survival of mice bearing such tumors. The inhibitory effect of NS-187 extends to 12 of 13 Bcr-Abl proteins with mutations in their kinase domain but not to T315I.

STUDY SUBJECTS: Cortisol profiling at 20-min intervals over 24 h during the fed state was undertaken in 34 patients (10 females), aged 17-53.7 yr (median, 21.5 yr), 2-29 yr (median, 11.5 yr) after receiving conventional cranial irradiation for nonpituitary brain tumors or leukemia (n = 5) and in 33 age-, gender-, and body mass index-matched normal controls, of whom 23 patients and 17 controls were also profiled in the last 24 h of a 33-h fast. RESULTS: The fed profile mean cortisol concentration (mean +/- sem) was significantly increased (by 14%) in the patients compared with that in normal subjects (213 +/- 6.9 vs. 187 +/- 6.7 nmol/liter; P = 0.009), with all individual values above the lowest seen in normal subjects. Multiparameter deconvolution analysis revealed a parallel increase (by 20%) in cortisol secretion rates (1.8 +/- 0.09 vs. 1.5 +/- 0.08 nmol/liter.min; P = 0.03) due to selective augmentation of the cortisol mass released per burst with no changes in burst frequency (12/24 h) or half-life. No significant differences were observed between males and females, after short-term fasting, or between female patients and normal females. Thus, in the light of total group comparisons, male patients had even higher values than normal males, and more so during fasting (mean cortisol and cortisol secretion increased by 20 and 29% in the fed state and by 41 and 32% in the fasting state, respectively; P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: This study has demonstrated that radiation-induced ACTH neurosecretory dysfunction does not exist and, thus, resolved the clinical dilemma as to whether cortisol replacement should be considered in those patients with excessive fatigue and normal stimulated cortisol responses. On the contrary, cranial irradiation causes activation of the corticotrope-adrenal axis, and in the absence of ACTH deficiency, this activation is manifested by parallel increases in circulating cortisol levels and cortisol production rates without any change in cortisol half-life. The lack of cortisol increase in female patients may be attributed to the adverse effect of their higher body mass index on cortisol secretion or may reflect a genuine gender dichotomy.","['Darzy, Ken H', 'Shalet, Stephen M']","['Darzy KH', 'Shalet SM']","['Department of Endocrinology, Christie Hospital, Wilmslow Road, Manchester M20 4BX, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Clin Endocrinol Metab,The Journal of clinical endocrinology and metabolism,0375362,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adrenocorticotropic Hormone/*metabolism', 'Adult', 'Brain Neoplasms/*metabolism/*radiotherapy', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Circadian Rhythm', 'Female', 'Human Growth Hormone/blood', 'Humans', 'Hydrocortisone/biosynthesis/blood/*metabolism/urine', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neurosecretory Systems/*metabolism', 'Osmolar Concentration', 'Sex Factors', 'Survivors']",2005/08/18 09:00,2005/10/07 09:00,['2005/08/18 09:00'],"['2005/08/18 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/10/07 09:00 [medline]', '2005/08/18 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Clin Endocrinol Metab. 2005 Sep;90(9):5217-25. doi: 10.1210/jc.2005-0830.

T cell transformation induced by HTLV-I involves the action of the 40-kDa viral Tax transactivator protein. Tax both stimulates the HTLV-I long terminal repeat and deregulates the expression of select cellular genes by altering the activity of specific host transcription factors, including cyclic AMP-responsive element-binding protein (CREB)/activating transcription factor, NF-kappaB/Rel, and serum response factor. To study initiating events involved in HTLV-I Tax-induced T cell transformation, we generated ""Tet-off"" transgenic mice conditionally expressing in a lymphocyte-restricted manner (EmuSR alpha promoter-enhancer) either wild-type Tax or mutant forms of Tax that selectively compromise the NF-kappaB (M22) or CREB/activating transcription factor (M47) activation pathways. Wild-type Tax and M47 Tax-expressing mice, but not M22-Tax expressing mice, developed progressive alopecia, hyperkeratosis, and skin lesions containing profuse activated CD4 T cell infiltrates with evidence of deregulated inflammatory cytokine production. In addition, these animals displayed systemic lymphadenopathy and splenomegaly. These findings suggest that Tax-mediated activation of NF-kappaB plays a key role in the development of this aggressive skin disease that shares several features in common with the skin disease occurring during the preleukemic stage in HTLV-I-infected patients.

Low-dose Ara-C was given subcutaneously at a dosage of 10 mg/m2 every 12 hours on days 1 to 14. Aclarubicin was administered intravenously at a dosage of 14 mg/m2 per day on days 1 to 4 (CAG regimen A) or 7 mg/m2 on days 1 to 8 (CAG regimen B).

The normal MLL-encoded protein is an essential component of a supercomplex with chromatin-modulating activity conferred by histone acetylase and methyltransferase activities, and the protein plays a key role in the developmental regulation of gene expression, including Hox gene expression. In leukemia, this function is subverted by breakage, recombination, and the formation of chimeric fusion with one of many alternative partners. Such MLL translocations result in the replacement of the C-terminal functional domains of MLL with those of a fusion partner, yielding a newly formed MLL chimeric protein with an altered function that endows hematopoietic progenitors with self-renewing and leukemogenic activity. This potent impact of the MLL chimera can be attributed to one of 2 kinds of activity of the fusion partner: direct transcriptional transactivation or dimerization/oligomerization. Key unresolved issues currently being addressed include the set of target genes for MLL fusions, the stem cell of origin for the leukemias, the role of additional secondary mutations, and the origins or etiology of the MLL gene fusions themselves.

Runx1 forms a heterodimer with CBF3 and binds to the consensus PEBP2 sequence through the Runt domain. Runx1 enhances gene transcription by interacting with transcriptional coactivators such as p300 and CREB-binding protein. However, Runx1 can also suppress gene transcription by interacting with transcriptional corepressors, including mSin3A, TLE (mammalian homolog of Groucho), and histone deacetylases. Runx1 not only is critical for definitive hematopoiesis in the fetus but also is required for normal megakaryocytic maturation and T-lymphocyte and B-lymphocyte development in adult mice. Runx1 has been identified in leukemia-associated chromosomal translocations, including t(8;21) (Runx1-ETO/MTG8), t(16;21) (Runx1-MTG16), t(3;21) (Runx1-Evi1), t(12;21) (TEL-Runx1), and t(X;21) (Runx1-Fog2). The molecular mechanism of leukemogenesis by these fusion proteins is discussed. Various mutant mice expressing these fusion proteins have been created. However, expression of the fusion protein is not sufficient by itself to cause leukemia and likely requires additional events for leukemogenesis. Point mutations in a Runx1 allele cause haploinsufficiency and a biallelic null for Runx1, which are associated with familial platelet disorder with a propensity for acute myeloid leukemia (FPD/AML) and AML-M0, respectively. Thus, the correct protein structure and the precise dosage of Runx1 are essential for the maintenance of normal hematopoiesis.","['Yamagata, Tetsuya', 'Maki, Kazuhiro', 'Mitani, Kinuko']","['Yamagata T', 'Maki K', 'Mitani K']","['Section on Immunology and Immunogenetics, Joslin Diabetes Center, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Japan,Int J Hematol,International journal of hematology,9111627,IM,"['Animals', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit/*physiology', 'Fetal Development', 'Hematopoiesis/*genetics/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*genetics/*physiopathology', 'Mice', 'Point Mutation', 'Transcription, Genetic/physiology', 'Translocation, Genetic']",2005/08/18 09:00,2006/01/07 09:00,['2005/08/18 09:00'],"['2005/08/18 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/01/07 09:00 [medline]', '2005/08/18 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Int J Hematol. 2005 Jul;82(1):1-8. doi: 10.1532/IJH97.05075.,,"['0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (RUNX1 protein, human)']",81,"['6FMH8DRQH42MJAEJ [pii]', '10.1532/IJH97.05075 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Cross-sectional data for 1988 through 1998 pertaining to all incident pediatric cancer cases (age < 15 years) with race/ethnicity coded as either Hispanic or non-Hispanic white came from the Florida Cancer Data System database and the California Cancer Registry database. The results were expressed as age-standardized incidence rates, standardized to the world standard million population. Hispanic rates and non-Hispanic white rates were compared using standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) with 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs.). RESULTS: The SIR for all cancers for Hispanic children compared to non-Hispanic white children was 1.02 (95% CI: 0.99, 1.05). For selected tumor types, SIRs indicated higher incidences among Hispanic children for leukemia (SIR = 1.26; 95% CI: 1.19, 1.34), Hodgkin's lymphoma (SIR = 1.29; 95% CI: 1.08, 1.54), and germ cell tumors (SIR = 1.62; 95% CI: 1.34, 1.96). There were lower incidences for the Hispanic children for central nervous system tumors (SIR = 0.72; 95% CI: 0.66, 0.78) and for sympathetic nervous system tumors (SIR = 0.76; 95% CI: 0.66, 0.87). In terms of interstate differences, the incidence of lymphoma, central nervous system tumors, sympathetic nervous system tumors, and malignant bone tumors was highest among Hispanic youth in Florida; the incidence of hepatic tumors was highest among Hispanic youth in California. CONCLUSIONS: While the overall cancer incidence rate among Hispanic children was similar to that for non-Hispanic white children, significant differences for specific tumor types were identified. Since Hispanic ethnicity may be a confounder for other cancer risk factors (e.g., familial, socioeconomic, or environmental), it is recommended that future research into Hispanic pediatric cancer risk investigate these risk factors.","['Wilkinson, James D', 'Gonzalez, Alex', 'Wohler-Torres, Brad', 'Fleming, Lora E', 'MacKinnon, Jill', 'Trapido, Edward', 'Button, Jaclyn', 'Peace, Steven']","['Wilkinson JD', 'Gonzalez A', 'Wohler-Torres B', 'Fleming LE', 'MacKinnon J', 'Trapido E', 'Button J', 'Peace S']","['University of Miami Miller School of Medicine, Florida Cancer Data System, Miami, FL 33101, USA. jwilkins@med.miami.edu']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Rev Panam Salud Publica,Revista panamericana de salud publica = Pan American journal of public health,9705400,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Female', 'Hispanic or Latino/*statistics & numerical data', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/epidemiology/*ethnology', 'Registries', 'United States/epidemiology']",2005/08/18 09:00,2005/10/21 09:00,['2005/08/18 09:00'],"['2005/08/18 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/10/21 09:00 [medline]', '2005/08/18 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Rev Panam Salud Publica. 2005 Jul;18(1):5-13. doi: 10.1590/s1020-49892005000600002.,,,,"['S1020-49892005000600002 [pii]', '10.1590/s1020-49892005000600002 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Caspofungin (Cancidas-Merck) is a large lipopeptide molecule able to inhibit the enzyme complex 1,3-d-glucan synthetase; this action specifically damages the fungal cell wall. Caspofungin (CAS) is active, in vitro and in vivo, against most Candida species and Aspergillus species. We report on our experience with this drug as first-line therapy for proven or probable pulmonary IFI in immunocompromised patients with hematologic malignancies. Thirty-two consecutive patients (20 males and 12 females, with a median age of 52 yr) have been treated with CAS (27 acute leukemias, 1 chronic leukemia, 3 lymphomas and 1 multiple myeloma). Sixteen patients (50%) had a relapsed or resistant hematologic disease, while 12 patients were in complete remission and 4 were at onset of disease; 8/32 (25%) developed IFI after a hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) procedure. Seven out of 32 patients (22%) had a proven pulmonary IFI (7/7 Aspergillosis) and 25 (78%) had a probable IFI with pulmonary localization as defined according to international consensus. Thirty-one patients (97%) had less than 1000 granulocytes/mL at onset of infection and at the start of CAS therapy. The CAS was given at the dose of 70 mg on day 1, followed by 50 mg/day. Median duration of CAS therapy was 20 d (range 8-64); all the 31 neutropenic patients received concomitant granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF). The overall response rate was 56% (18/32) with 12/18 complete responses and 6/18 partial responses; two patients (6%) had a stable disease. Twelve out of 32 (38%) did not respond and seven died of mycotic infection. Univariate analysis showed that granulocytes recovery (>500/mL vs. <500/mL) and status of hematologic disease (remission/onset vs. refractory/relapsed) were significantly associated to favourable outcome. No clinical adverse events (AE) were reported and only a grades I and II transient increase of serum alkaline phosphatase and/or transaminases occurred in 4/32 (12%) patients. After CAS therapy six non-responders and six cases with a partial or stable response were rescued with voriconazole. Two out of six patients (33%) in the former group and 6/6 (100%) in the latter obtained a complete resolution of IFI. Our experience suggests an efficacy of CAS, in combination with G-CSF, as first-line treatment of proven or probable IFI with pulmonary localization. The drug was well tolerated and there were no significant hepatic AE even in patients receiving CAS with cyclosporine after a HSCT. A significant proportion of non-responders or partial responders to CAS can be rescued with a subsequent voriconazole-based therapy.","['Candoni, Anna', 'Mestroni, Rosalba', 'Damiani, Daniela', 'Tiribelli, Mario', 'Michelutti, Angela', 'Silvestri, Federico', 'Castelli, Maurizio', 'Viale, Pierluigi', 'Fanin, Renato']","['Candoni A', 'Mestroni R', 'Damiani D', 'Tiribelli M', 'Michelutti A', 'Silvestri F', 'Castelli M', 'Viale P', 'Fanin R']","['Division of Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation, Department of Medical and Morphological Researches (DMMR), University Hospital, Udine, Italy. candoni.a@tiscali.it']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Eur J Haematol,European journal of haematology,8703985,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antifungal Agents/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Caspofungin', 'Echinocandins', 'Female', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*complications/immunology', 'Humans', '*Immunocompromised Host', 'Lipopeptides', 'Lung Diseases, Fungal/complications/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Peptides, Cyclic/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Survival Analysis', 'Treatment Outcome']",2005/08/18 09:00,2005/09/27 09:00,['2005/08/18 09:00'],"['2005/08/18 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/09/27 09:00 [medline]', '2005/08/18 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Eur J Haematol. 2005 Sep;75(3):227-33. doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0609.2005.00500.x.,,"['0 (Antifungal Agents)', '0 (Echinocandins)', '0 (Lipopeptides)', '0 (Peptides, Cyclic)', 'F0XDI6ZL63 (Caspofungin)']",,"['EJH500 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1600-0609.2005.00500.x [doi]']",,['Copyright Blackwell Munksgaard 2005.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The two families of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors (CDKIs) (INK4 family of p15, p16, p18 and p19 and CIP/KIP family of p21, p27 and p57) that negatively regulate cell cycle progression are known tumor suppressor genes. To determine whether genetic alterations of p16 and p27 genes play an important role in MDS pathogenesis, we examined DNA from 51 patients classified as 17 refractory anemias (RA), four refractory anemias with ringed sideroblasts (RARS), 19 refractory anemias with an excess of blasts (RAEB), 5 refractory anemias with excess of blasts in transformation (RAEB-t) and 6 chronic myelomonocytic leukemias (CMML). Southern blot analysis detected no homozygous deletions of p16 and p27. Polymerase chain reaction-single-strand conformation polymorphism (PCR-SSCP) and sequencing did not reveal point mutations for both genes with the exception of two allelic polymorphisms, namely a C --> G transition at 447 bp of p16exon3 and a T --> A transition at 791 bp of p27exon1 genes.

While occurrence of each of these PTD/ITD seem to confer an unfavorable prognosis, the literature contains only sparse information of the occurrence and the prognosis of simultaneous PTD/ITD of these genes. We have therefore attempted to determine the presence and its consequence in AML and with the further aim of characterizing such patients with respect to other genetic aberrations and to prototype variables in this disease. We analyzed blast cells from 250 adult patients treated at the same institution during a 15-year period for FLT3 ITD and MLL PTD and the duplications were found in 24% and 4%, respectively. The four co-duplicated cases (2%) did not differ with respect to sex, age, FAB-type, or immunophenotype, promoter methylation of p15, E-cadherin (CDH1), Estrogen receptor, MDR1, expression of apoptosis-related or multidrug resistance-related genes, though a trend toward decreased gene expression of MDR1 was observed. Two of the patients had a normal karyotypic analysis, while the remaining two showed aberrations in chromosome 11, one with trisomy 11 and the other with a der (11). The extensive molecular characterization of FLT3/MLL coduplicated patients presented here indicates that, even though they do not differ molecularly from the groups of patients with single ITDs, their prognosis and overall survival is universally poor. More patients are needed to determine whether coduplication has independent clinical implications compared to patients with single ITD/PTD.","['Olesen, Lene Hyldahl', 'Nyvold, Charlotte Guldborg', 'Aggerholm, Anni', 'Norgaard, Jan Maxwell', 'Guldberg, Per', 'Hokland, Peter']","['Olesen LH', 'Nyvold CG', 'Aggerholm A', 'Norgaard JM', 'Guldberg P', 'Hokland P']","['Department of Hematology, Aarhus University Hospital, Denmark.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Eur J Haematol,European journal of haematology,8703985,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Base Sequence', 'DNA Methylation', 'DNA Primers', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics', '*Gene Duplication', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*genetics', 'Mutation', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*genetics', 'Proto-Oncogenes/*genetics', 'Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*genetics', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3']",2005/08/18 09:00,2005/09/27 09:00,['2005/08/18 09:00'],"['2005/08/18 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/09/27 09:00 [medline]', '2005/08/18 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Eur J Haematol. 2005 Sep;75(3):185-92. doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0609.2005.00502.x.,,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (KMT2A protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)']",,"['EJH502 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1600-0609.2005.00502.x [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The treatment was accomplished with ultralow (3 mg/m2/12h s.c.) and low doses (10 mg/m2/12h s.c.) of ARA-C in 75% of the patients with RAEBt and 44.4% with RAEB, while the CMML group received hydroxyurea. The treatment improved hematologic results but the complete remission lacked. In 23.8% of the cases the disease developed into acute nonlymphoblastic leukemia. Patients excepted from cytostatic therapy were observed by the use of androgens, anabolics, vitamin A+D3 and transfusion of separated erythrocytes. In 38% of the patients with MDS a lethal outcome followed. Life of those in whom the disease developed into acute leukemia in statistically significatly shorter (p < 0.05). There was no statistically significant difference in the survival rate between the treated and nontreated patients (p > 0.05). Further treatment of these patients includes, apart from ultralow doses of ARA-C, the use of retinoic acid, a growth factor (GM-CSF) and bone marrow transplantation.","['Belic, A', 'Pejin, D', 'Stefanovic, N', 'Spasojevic, J', 'Popovic, S', 'Uzurov, V', 'Kljajic, D']","['Belic A', 'Pejin D', 'Stefanovic N', 'Spasojevic J', 'Popovic S', 'Uzurov V', 'Kljajic D']","['Medicinski fakultet, Klinika za interne bolesi.']",['srp'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Serbia,Med Pregl,Medicinski pregled,2985249R,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/diagnosis/*therapy', 'Prognosis']",1992/01/01 00:00,2005/10/20 09:00,['1992/01/01 00:00'],"['1992/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2005/10/20 09:00 [medline]', '1992/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Med Pregl. 1992;45(3-4):106-10.,,,,,Nase iskustvo u lecenju obolelih od mijelodisplasticnih sindroma.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The current prospective study addresses this issue in the context of currently accepted independent prognostic variables. METHODS: The current study is a single institution study in which patients with MMM were accrued between January 2000 and August 2001 and followed in a prospective fashion. All study patients underwent bone marrow examination with cytogenetic studies as well as comprehensive clinical and laboratory evaluation at the time of karyotype analysis. RESULTS: Among the study cohort of 81 patients (with a median age of 61 years; 54 males), the cytogenetic findings were normal in 44 patients (54%; Group 1). The remaining 37 patients (46%) demonstrated either interstitial deletions involving the long arm of chromosome 13 or 20 (9 patients; Group 2) or other abnormalities (28 patients; Group 3). All study patients were followed prospectively for a minimum of 40 months (range, 40-55 months). Survival from the time of karyotypic analysis was found to be similar between Groups 1 and 2 but was significantly worse in Group 3. Furthermore, none of the patients in Group 2 experienced leukemic transformation, whereas five patients each from the other two groups did. Multivariate analysis identified an unfavorable cytogenetic profile (Group 3), > or = 1% circulating blasts, a hemoglobin level of <10 g/dL, and constitutional symptoms as adverse prognostic features for overall survival. CONCLUSIONS: Specific cytogenetic lesions in patients with MMM might carry an independent prognostic effect for both survival and the risk of leukemic transformation. Such information should assist in decision making when considering aggressive treatment approaches.","['Tefferi, Ayalew', 'Dingli, David', 'Li, Chin-Yang', 'Dewald, Gordon W']","['Tefferi A', 'Dingli D', 'Li CY', 'Dewald GW']","['Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota 55905, USA. tefferi.ayalew@mayo.edu']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', '*Chromosome Aberrations', 'Chromosomes, Human/genetics', 'Cohort Studies', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia/genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Primary Myelofibrosis/complications/diagnosis/*genetics', 'Prognosis', 'Prospective Studies', 'Survival Rate']",2005/08/17 09:00,2006/01/13 09:00,['2005/08/17 09:00'],"['2005/08/17 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/01/13 09:00 [medline]', '2005/08/17 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer. 2005 Oct 15;104(8):1656-60. doi: 10.1002/cncr.21358.,,,,['10.1002/cncr.21358 [doi]'],,['Copyright 2005 American Cancer Society'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The present study was conducted to explore the possibility that tumour cells with no intrinsic defects of the p53 pathway might nevertheless acquire p53 dysfunction through extrinsic suppression of the pathway by microenvironmental factors. Neoplastic cells from patients with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) were cultured in the presence or absence of basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) and exposed to ionizing radiation (IR) to induce p53 accumulation. bFGF is greatly increased in the plasma of CLL patients and can suppress p53 activation in some experimental models. IR induced a marked increase in p53 levels in 28 samples from 24 patients. bFGF inhibited IR-induced p53 accumulation to some extent in most of these samples and by more than 50% in seven samples from seven patients. Suppression of p53 activation by bFGF was frequently but not always accompanied by upregulation of the p53-inhibitory protein MDM2 and/or phosphorylation of MDM2 at serine 166, and was associated with impaired transcriptional activation of the p53 target gene p21. These observations provide the first demonstration in human cancer cells that the p53 pathway can be suppressed by factors in the tumour-cell microenvironment.","['Romanov, Vadim V', 'James, Christine H', 'Sherrington, Paul D', 'Pettitt, Andrew R']","['Romanov VV', 'James CH', 'Sherrington PD', 'Pettitt AR']","['Department of Haematology, Royal Liverpool University Hospital, Level 2 Ducan Building, Prescot Street, Liverpool, Merseyside L7 8XP, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,IM,"['Base Sequence', 'DNA Primers', 'Fibroblast Growth Factor 2/*physiology', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/pathology/*physiopathology', 'Phosphorylation', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-mdm2/chemistry/metabolism', 'Radiation, Ionizing', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/*physiology']",2005/08/17 09:00,2005/12/13 09:00,['2005/08/17 09:00'],"['2005/08/17 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/12/13 09:00 [medline]', '2005/08/17 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2005 Oct 13;24(45):6855-60. doi: 10.1038/sj.onc.1208895.,,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '103107-01-3 (Fibroblast Growth Factor 2)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (MDM2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-mdm2)']",,"['1208895 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.onc.1208895 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The current study attempted to evaluate the potential prognostic role of multidrug resistance (MDR), regarded as one of the potential prognostic factors for the outcome of overall AML, for AML with normal karyotypes. METHOD AND MATERIALS: A functional MDR assay was performed in pretreatment samples from AML patients with normal karyotypes. The complete remission (CR) rate, event-free survival (EFS), and overall survival (OS) were analyzed according to the MDR status and clinical prognostic factors for 88 patients with AML with normal karyotypes. RESULTS: MDR by efflux was expressed in 14 out of 48 evaluable patients (29%) but failed to identify the association with CR (p = 0.124). However, MDR was identified as an independent prognostic factor for EFS and OS (p = 0.013 and 0.046) together with the use of stem cell transplantation (p = 0.009 for EFS and 0.029 for OS) and the WBC count at presentation (p = 0.023 for EFS and 0.034 for OS). CONCLUSION: The functional MDR assay may provide information on the prognosis of AML patients with normal karyotypes, and it might be a possible guideline for risk-stratified treatment strategies in AML with normal karyotypes.","['Kim, Dong Hwan', 'Lee, Nan Young', 'Sung, Woo Jin', 'Baek, Jin Ho', 'Kim, Jong Gwang', 'Sohn, Sang Kyun', 'Suh, Jang Soo', 'Lee, Kun Soo', 'Lee, Kyu Bo']","['Kim DH', 'Lee NY', 'Sung WJ', 'Baek JH', 'Kim JG', 'Sohn SK', 'Suh JS', 'Lee KS', 'Lee KB']","['Department of Hematology/Oncology, Kyungpook National University Hospital, Jung-Gu, Daegu, Korea.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Switzerland,Acta Haematol,Acta haematologica,0141053,IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/*metabolism', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*metabolism', 'Drug Resistance, Multiple', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*metabolism/mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'Prognosis', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2005/08/17 09:00,2005/09/15 09:00,['2005/08/17 09:00'],"['2004/08/19 00:00 [received]', '2004/11/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2005/08/17 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/09/15 09:00 [medline]', '2005/08/17 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Acta Haematol. 2005;114(2):78-83. doi: 10.1159/000086579.,,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)']",,"['86579 [pii]', '10.1159/000086579 [doi]']",,"['Copyright (c) 2005 S.

Given that the deregulated expression of a variety of growth factors and/or their receptors has been implicated in the pathogenesis of certain leukemias, we aimed to characterize the potential differences in the expression pattern of the two major leptin receptor transcript variants in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) between different hematologic malignancies. Using RT-PCR and Southern blotting, we compared the expression levels of the two major leptin receptors, the longest (OB-R(L)) and the shortest (OB-R(S)) splice variants, in PBMC from patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), acute myeloid leukemia (AML), healthy individuals and two human hematopoietic cell lines (HL-60 and K562). Expression of the OB-R(S) transcript clearly exceeded that of OB-R(L) in all patients and controls and in the HL-60 cells, but this was reversed in the K562 cell line. However, the expression of the OB-R(L) was significantly lower in MDS compared to controls and tended to be so in AML, while OB-R(S) tended to be higher in MDS and AML patients compared to controls, but this difference was not significant. Serum leptin levels and circulating soluble leptin receptor levels were slightly but not significantly higher in AML and MDS. These alterations in the expression of the leptin receptor isoforms in MDS and AML patients could suggest a potential role of leptin and its signaling in hematopoietic malignancies, which requires further examination.","['Tsiotra, Panayoula C', 'Pappa, Vassiliki', 'Koukourava, Athina', 'Economopoulos, Theofanis', 'Tsigos, Constantine', 'Raptis, Sotirios A']","['Tsiotra PC', 'Pappa V', 'Koukourava A', 'Economopoulos T', 'Tsigos C', 'Raptis SA']","['Hellenic National Diabetes Center (HNDC), Division of Basic Sciences, Athens, Greece. ytsiotra@hndc.gr']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Switzerland,Acta Haematol,Acta haematologica,0141053,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', '*Alternative Splicing', 'Female', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Leptin/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/*metabolism', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/genetics/*metabolism', 'Protein Isoforms/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Receptors, Cell Surface/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Receptors, Leptin', 'Signal Transduction']",2005/08/17 09:00,2005/09/15 09:00,['2005/08/17 09:00'],"['2004/07/07 00:00 [received]', '2004/11/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2005/08/17 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/09/15 09:00 [medline]', '2005/08/17 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Acta Haematol. 2005;114(2):71-7. doi: 10.1159/000086578.,,"['0 (LEPR protein, human)', '0 (Leptin)', '0 (Protein Isoforms)', '0 (Receptors, Cell Surface)', '0 (Receptors, Leptin)']",,"['86578 [pii]', '10.1159/000086578 [doi]']",,"['Copyright (c) 2005 S.

We evaluated the possible etiologic role of daycare attendance (a proxy measure for exposure to infectious agents) and infections during infancy in the Northern California Childhood Leukemia Study. A total of 294 incident ALL cases (ages 1-14 years) and 376 individually matched controls were included in this analysis. In non-Hispanic White children, daycare attendance measured by child-hours was associated with a significantly reduced risk of ALL. Compared with children who did not attend any daycare, the odds ratio (OR) for those who had >5,000 child-hours during infancy was 0.42 [95% confidence interval (95% CI), 0.18-0.99] for ALL and 0.33 (95% CI, 0.11-1.01) for c-ALL. Test for trend is also significant, which supports a dose-response relationship. The magnitude of effect associated with the same number of child-hours was stronger for daycare attendance during infancy than for daycare attendance before diagnosis. In addition, self-reported ear infection during infancy was associated with a significantly reduced risk of c-ALL (OR, 0.32; 95% CI, 0.14-0.74) in non-Hispanic White children. In Hispanic children, no association was observed among daycare attendance, early infections, and risk of childhood ALL or c-ALL. These results offer indirect yet strong support for the infectious disease hypothesis in the etiology of ALL in non-Hispanic White children and highlight an important ethnic difference.","['Ma, Xiaomei', 'Buffler, Patricia A', 'Wiemels, Joseph L', 'Selvin, Steve', 'Metayer, Catherine', 'Loh, Mignon', 'Does, Monique B', 'Wiencke, John K']","['Ma X', 'Buffler PA', 'Wiemels JL', 'Selvin S', 'Metayer C', 'Loh M', 'Does MB', 'Wiencke JK']","['Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, Yale University School of Medicine, 60 College Street, New Haven, CT 06520-8034, USA. xiaomei.ma@yale.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev,"Cancer epidemiology, biomarkers & prevention : a publication of the American Association for Cancer Research, cosponsored by the American Society of Preventive Oncology",9200608,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Child', '*Child Day Care Centers', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Hispanic or Latino', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Maternal Age', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*etiology', 'Risk Factors', 'San Francisco/epidemiology/ethnology', 'Social Class', 'Whites']",2005/08/17 09:00,2005/11/09 09:00,['2005/08/17 09:00'],"['2005/08/17 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/11/09 09:00 [medline]', '2005/08/17 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev. 2005 Aug;14(8):1928-34. doi: 10.1158/1055-9965.EPI-05-0115.,"['PS42 ES04705/PS/NCHHSTP CDC HHS/United States', 'R01 ES09137/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States']",,,"['14/8/1928 [pii]', '10.1158/1055-9965.EPI-05-0115 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In order to find oncogenes implicated in T-cell leukemia, we used the highly leukemogenic radiation leukemia retrovirus VL3 (RadLV/VL3). We applied the inverted PCR technique to isolate and analyze sequences flanking proviral integrations in RadLV/VL3-induced T lymphomas. We found retroviral integrations in c-myc and Pim1 as already reported but we also identified for the first time Notch1 as a RadLV common integration site. More interestingly, we found a new RadLV common integration site that is situated on mouse chromosome X (XA4 region, bp 45091000). This site has also been reported as an SL3-3 and Moloney murine leukemia virus integration site, which strengthens its implication in murine leukemia virus-induced T lymphomas. This locus, named Kis2 (Kaplan Integration Site 2), was found rearranged in 11% of the tumors analyzed. In this article, we report not only the alteration of the Kis2 gene located nearby in response to RadLV integration but also the induction of the expression of Phf6, situated about 250 kbp from the integration site. The Kis2 gene encodes five different alternatively spliced noncoding RNAs and the Phf6 gene codes for a 365-amino-acid protein which contains two plant homology domain fingers, recently implicated in the Borjeson-Forssman-Lehmann syndrome in humans. With the recent release of the mouse genome sequence, high-throughput retroviral tagging emerges as a powerful tool in the quest for oncogenes. It also allows the analysis of large DNA regions surrounding the integration locus.","['Landais, Severine', 'Quantin, Renaud', 'Rassart, Eric']","['Landais S', 'Quantin R', 'Rassart E']","['Departement des Sciences Biologiques, Universite du Quebec a Montreal, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Experimental/virology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Microtubule-Associated Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'NIH 3T3 Cells', 'Nuclear Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'RNA, Untranslated/*metabolism', 'RNA, Viral/genetics/*metabolism', 'Radiation Leukemia Virus/*physiology', 'Receptor, Notch1', 'Receptors, Cell Surface/genetics', 'Retroviridae Infections/virology', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Transcription Factors/genetics', 'Tumor Virus Infections/virology', 'Virus Integration', 'X Chromosome/genetics', 't-Complex Genome Region']",2005/08/17 09:00,2005/09/30 09:00,['2005/08/17 09:00'],"['2005/08/17 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/09/30 09:00 [medline]', '2005/08/17 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Virol. 2005 Sep;79(17):11443-56. doi: 10.1128/JVI.79.17.11443-11456.2005.,,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Microtubule-Associated Proteins)', '0 (Notch1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Untranslated)', '0 (RNA, Viral)', '0 (Receptor, Notch1)', '0 (Receptors, Cell Surface)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",,"['79/17/11443 [pii]', '10.1128/JVI.79.17.11443-11456.2005 [doi]']",,,,,PMC1193593,,,,,,,,,,,

The gene product of open reading frame 3 in the early region 4 (E4orf3) of adenovirus serotype 5 (Ad5) is involved in efficient replication and late protein synthesis. During infection with adenovirus mutants lacking the E4 region, the viral genomic DNA is joined into concatemers by cellular DNA repair factors, and this requires the Mre11/Rad50/Nbs1 complex. Concatemer formation can be prevented by the E4orf3 protein, which causes the cellular redistribution of the Mre11 complex. Here we show that E4orf3 colocalizes with components of the Mre11 complex in nuclear tracks and also in large cytoplasmic accumulations. Rearrangement of Mre11 and Rad50 by Ad5 E4orf3 is not dependent on interactions with Nbs1 or promyelocytic leukemia protein nuclear bodies. Late in infection the cytoplasmic inclusions appear as a distinct juxtanuclear accumulation at the centrosome and this requires an intact microtubule cytoskeleton. The large cytoplasmic accumulations meet the criteria defined for aggresomes, including gamma-tubulin colocalization and formation of a surrounding vimentin cage. E4orf3 also appears to alter the solubility of the cellular Mre11 complex. These data suggest that E4orf3 can target the Mre11 complex to an aggresome and may explain how the cellular repair complex is inactivated during adenovirus infection.","['Araujo, Felipe D', 'Stracker, Travis H', 'Carson, Christian T', 'Lee, Darwin V', 'Weitzman, Matthew D']","['Araujo FD', 'Stracker TH', 'Carson CT', 'Lee DV', 'Weitzman MD']","['Laboratory of Genetics, Salk Institute for Biological Studies, San Diego, CA 92186-5800, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,IM,"['Acid Anhydride Hydrolases', 'Adenovirus E4 Proteins/*metabolism', 'Adenoviruses, Human/physiology', 'Cell Cycle Proteins/metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Cytoplasm/*metabolism', 'DNA Repair Enzymes/metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'MRE11 Homologue Protein', 'Multiprotein Complexes/metabolism', 'Nuclear Proteins/metabolism', 'Solubility', 'Tubulin/metabolism']",2005/08/17 09:00,2005/09/30 09:00,['2005/08/17 09:00'],"['2005/08/17 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/09/30 09:00 [medline]', '2005/08/17 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Virol. 2005 Sep;79(17):11382-91. doi: 10.1128/JVI.79.17.11382-11391.2005.,"['R01 CA097093/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'AI43341/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'CA97093/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['0 (Adenovirus E4 Proteins)', '0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (MRE11 protein, human)', '0 (Multiprotein Complexes)', '0 (NBN protein, human)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Tubulin)', 'EC 3.1.- (MRE11 Homologue Protein)', 'EC 3.6.- (Acid Anhydride Hydrolases)', 'EC 3.6.- (Rad50 protein, human)', 'EC 6.5.1.- (DNA Repair Enzymes)']",,"['79/17/11382 [pii]', '10.1128/JVI.79.17.11382-11391.2005 [doi]']",,,,,PMC1193610,,,,,,,,,,,

It was therefore the aim of our study to investigate the potential of telomerase-dependent virotherapy in multimodal treatment of HCC. In contrast to normal liver, HCC xenografts showed high telomerase activity, resulting in tumor-restricted expression of E1A by a telomerase-dependent replicating adenovirus (hTERT-Ad). Neither tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) or chemotherapy alone nor the combined treatment with both agents resulted in significant destruction of HCC cells. Application of hTERT-Ad at low titers was also not capable to destroy HCC cells, but telomerase-dependent virotherapy overcame the resistance of HCC against TRAIL and chemotherapy. The synergistic effects are explained by a strong down-regulation of Mcl-1 expression through hTERT-Ad that sensitizes HCC for TRAIL- and chemotherapy-mediated apoptosis. To investigate whether down-regulation of Mcl-1 alone is sufficient to explain synergistic effects observed with virotherapy, Mcl-1 expression was inhibited by RNA interference. Treatment with Mcl-1-siRNA significantly enhanced caspase-3 activity after chemotherapy and TRAIL application, confirming that elimination of Mcl-1 is responsible for the drug sensitization by hTERT-Ad. Consistent with these results, heterologous overexpression of Mcl-1 significantly reduced the sensitization of hTERT-Ad transduced cells against apoptosis-inducing agents. Chemotherapy did not interfere with quantitative hTERT-Ad production in HCC cells. Whereas hTERT-Ad virotherapy alone was only capable to inhibit the growth of Hep3B xenografts, virochemotherapy resulted in vast destruction of the drug-resistant HCC. In conclusion our data indicate that telomerase-dependent virotherapy is an attractive strategy to overcome the natural resistance of HCC against anticancer drugs by elimination of Mcl-1.","['Wirth, Thomas', 'Kuhnel, Florian', 'Fleischmann-Mundt, Bettina', 'Woller, Norman', 'Djojosubroto, Meta', 'Rudolph, Karl Lenhard', 'Manns, Michael', 'Zender, Lars', 'Kubicka, Stefan']","['Wirth T', 'Kuhnel F', 'Fleischmann-Mundt B', 'Woller N', 'Djojosubroto M', 'Rudolph KL', 'Manns M', 'Zender L', 'Kubicka S']","['Department of Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Endocrinology, Medical School Hannover, Hannover, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,IM,"['Adenoviridae/genetics/metabolism', 'Adenovirus E1A Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Animals', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins', 'Carcinoma, Hepatocellular/drug therapy/genetics/*therapy/virology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Down-Regulation', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Drug Synergism', 'Humans', 'Liver Neoplasms/drug therapy/genetics/*therapy/virology', 'Male', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/biosynthesis/genetics/*pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Nude', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*antagonists & inhibitors/biosynthesis/deficiency/genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*antagonists & inhibitors/biosynthesis/deficiency/genetics', 'TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand', 'Telomerase/*metabolism', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/biosynthesis/genetics/*pharmacology', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",2005/08/17 09:00,2005/10/28 09:00,['2005/08/17 09:00'],"['2005/08/17 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/10/28 09:00 [medline]', '2005/08/17 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 2005 Aug 15;65(16):7393-402. doi: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-04-3664.,,"['0 (Adenovirus E1A Proteins)', '0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (Mcl1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand)', '0 (TNFSF10 protein, human)', '0 (Tnfsf10 protein, mouse)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (Telomerase)']",,"['65/16/7393 [pii]', '10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-04-3664 [doi]']",,,,,,['Cancer Res. 2018 Oct 15;78(20):6026.

Patients harboring FLT3/ITD mutations have a relatively poor prognosis. FLT3/ITD results in constitutive autophosphorylation of the receptor and factor-independent survival. Previous studies have shown that FLT3/ITD activates the signal transducers and activators of transcription 5 (STAT5), p42/p44 mitogen-activated protein kinase [MAPK; extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) 1/2], and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt pathways. We herein provide biochemical and biological evidence that ribosomal S6 kinase 1 (RSK1) and protein kinase A (PKA) are the two principal kinases that mediate the antiapoptotic function of FLT3/ITD via phosphorylation of BAD at Ser112. Inhibiting both MAPK kinase (MEK)/ERK and PKA pathways by a combination of U0126 (10 micromol/L) and H-89 (5 micromol/L) reduced most of BAD phosphorylation at Ser112 and induced apoptosis to a level comparable with that induced by FLT3 inhibitor AG1296 (5 micromol/L) in BaF3/FLT3/ITD cells. RNA interference of RSK1 or PKA catalytic subunit reduced BAD phosphorylation and induced apoptosis. The MEK inhibitor U0126 and/or the PKA inhibitor H-89 greatly enhanced the efficacy of the FLT3 inhibitor AG1296, suggesting that combining FLT3/ITD downstream pathway inhibition with FLT3 inhibitors may be a viable therapeutic strategy for AML caused by a FLT3/ITD mutation.","['Yang, Xinping', 'Liu, Liyun', 'Sternberg, David', 'Tang, Liren', 'Galinsky, Ilene', 'DeAngelo, Daniel', 'Stone, Richard']","['Yang X', 'Liu L', 'Sternberg D', 'Tang L', 'Galinsky I', 'DeAngelo D', 'Stone R']","['Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts 02115, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Apoptosis/drug effects/genetics', 'Butadienes/pharmacology', 'Carrier Proteins/*metabolism', 'Cyclic AMP-Dependent Protein Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Drug Synergism', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology/drug effects/enzymology', 'Interleukin-3/*deficiency/metabolism', 'Isoquinolines/pharmacology', 'MAP Kinase Signaling System/drug effects', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', '*Mutation', 'Nitriles/pharmacology', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/*genetics/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/biosynthesis', 'RNA Interference', 'Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors/*genetics/metabolism', 'Ribosomal Protein S6 Kinases, 90-kDa/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Serine/metabolism', 'Sulfonamides/pharmacology', 'Tandem Repeat Sequences/genetics', 'Tyrphostins/pharmacology', 'bcl-Associated Death Protein', 'bcl-X Protein', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3']",2005/08/17 09:00,2005/10/28 09:00,['2005/08/17 09:00'],"['2005/08/17 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/10/28 09:00 [medline]', '2005/08/17 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 2005 Aug 15;65(16):7338-47. doi: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-04-2263.,['2PO1CA66996-06/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['0 (Bad protein, mouse)', '0 (Bcl2l1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Butadienes)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Interleukin-3)', '0 (Isoquinolines)', '0 (Nitriles)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Sulfonamides)', '0 (Tyrphostins)', '0 (U 0126)', '0 (bcl-Associated Death Protein)', '0 (bcl-X Protein)', '146535-11-7 (6,7-dimethoxy-3-phenylquinoxaline)', '452VLY9402 (Serine)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Flt3 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Ribosomal Protein S6 Kinases, 90-kDa)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Rps6ka1 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.11.11 (Cyclic AMP-Dependent Protein Kinases)', 'M876330O56 (N-(2-(4-bromocinnamylamino)ethyl)-5-isoquinolinesulfonamide)']",,"['65/16/7338 [pii]', '10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-04-2263 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Individual CLL-cell clones markedly differ in their ability to respond to B-cell receptor ligation, but the mechanism underlying the frequent hyporesponsiveness is incompletely understood. Our aim was to further clarify the extent and cause of the B-cell receptor signaling abnormality in CLL and to assign pathophysiologic relevance to the presence or absence of B-cell receptor responsiveness. We show that extracellular signal-regulated kinase-2 phosphorylation, intracellular Ca2+ increases, CD79a phosphorylation, and translocation of the B-cell receptor to lipid rafts in response to ligation with anti-immunoglobulin M (as a surrogate for antigen) are features of CLL cells with relatively unmutated VH genes (<5% deviation from germ line) and a poor prognosis. B-cell receptor stimulation in these cases also promoted cell survival. In clones with mutated VH genes (>5% deviation from germ line), surface immunoglobulin M ligation failed to induce receptor translocation to rafts or to prolong cell survival. This failure of receptor translocation observed in mutated CLL cells was associated with the constitutive exclusion of the B-cell receptor from rafts by a mechanism involving src-dependent interactions between the B-cell receptor and the actin cytoskeleton. We conclude that exposure to antigen promotes the survival of unmutated CLL clones, contributing to the poor prognosis of this group. In contrast, hyporesponsive mutated CLL clones may have developed into a stage where continuous exposure to antigen results in relative tolerance to antigenic stimulation mediated by the exclusion of the B-cell receptor from lipid rafts.","['Allsup, David J', 'Kamiguti, Aura S', 'Lin, Ke', 'Sherrington, Paul D', 'Matrai, Zoltan', 'Slupsky, Joseph R', 'Cawley, John C', 'Zuzel, Mirko']","['Allsup DJ', 'Kamiguti AS', 'Lin K', 'Sherrington PD', 'Matrai Z', 'Slupsky JR', 'Cawley JC', 'Zuzel M']","['Department of Haematology, Royal Liverpool University Hospital, Liverpool, United Kingdom. david.allsup@hey.nhs.uk']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,IM,"['Antigens, CD/metabolism', 'CD79 Antigens', 'Calcium/metabolism', 'Cell Survival/physiology', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin M/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/genetics/immunology/*metabolism/pathology', 'Membrane Microdomains/*metabolism', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1/metabolism', 'Mutation', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Phosphorylation', 'Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction']",2005/08/17 09:00,2005/10/28 09:00,['2005/08/17 09:00'],"['2005/08/17 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/10/28 09:00 [medline]', '2005/08/17 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 2005 Aug 15;65(16):7328-37. doi: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-03-1563.,,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (CD79 Antigens)', '0 (CD79A protein, human)', '0 (Immunoglobulin M)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",,"['65/16/7328 [pii]', '10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-03-1563 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although expression of OLIG2 is normally restricted to neural tissues, overexpression of OLIG2 has been shown in patients with precursor T-cell lymphoblastic lymphoma/leukemia (pre-T LBL). In the current study, we found that overexpression of OLIG2 was not only found in oligodendroglioma samples and normal neural tissue but also in a wide spectrum of malignant cell lines including leukemia, non-small cell lung carcinoma, melanoma, and breast cancer cell lines. To investigate whether enforced expression of OLIG2 is oncogenic, we generated transgenic mice that overexpressed OLIG2 in the thymus. Ectopic OLIG2 expression in the thymus was only weakly oncogenic as only 2 of 85 mice developed pre-T LBL. However, almost 60% of transgenic mice that overexpressed both OLIG2 and LMO1 developed pre-T LBL with large thymic tumor masses. Gene expression profiling of thymic tumors that developed in OLIG2/LMO1 mice revealed up-regulation of Notch1 as well as Deltex1 (Dtx1) and pre T-cell antigen receptor alpha (Ptcra), two genes that are considered to be downstream of Notch1. Of note, we found mutations in the Notch1 heterodimerization or proline-, glutamic acid-, serine-, and threonine-rich domain in three of six primary thymic tumors. In addition, growth of leukemic cell lines established from OLIG2/LMO1 transgenic mice was suppressed by a gamma-secretase inhibitor, suggesting that Notch1 up-regulation is important for the proliferation of OLIG2-LMO1 leukemic cells.","['Lin, Ying-Wei', 'Deveney, Ramona', 'Barbara, Mary', 'Iscove, Norman N', 'Nimer, Stephen D', 'Slape, Christopher', 'Aplan, Peter D']","['Lin YW', 'Deveney R', 'Barbara M', 'Iscove NN', 'Nimer SD', 'Slape C', 'Aplan PD']","['Genetics Branch, Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute, NIH, Bethesda, Maryland 20889-5105, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,IM,"['Amyloid Precursor Protein Secretases', 'Animals', 'Aspartic Acid Endopeptidases/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors', 'Cell Growth Processes/drug effects/physiology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/genetics/*metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics', 'Endopeptidases', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Humans', 'LIM Domain Proteins', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/*genetics/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Mutation', 'Nerve Tissue Proteins/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Nuclear Proteins', 'Oligodendrocyte Transcription Factor 2', 'Oncogene Proteins/*genetics', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics/metabolism', 'Receptor, Notch1', 'Receptors, Cell Surface/genetics', 'Thymus Neoplasms/genetics/metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/genetics']",2005/08/17 09:00,2005/10/28 09:00,['2005/08/17 09:00'],"['2005/08/17 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/10/28 09:00 [medline]', '2005/08/17 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 2005 Aug 15;65(16):7151-8. doi: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-05-1400.,,"['0 (Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (LIM Domain Proteins)', '0 (LMO1 protein, human)', '0 (Lmo1 protein, mouse)', '0 (NOTCH1 protein, human)', '0 (Nerve Tissue Proteins)', '0 (Notch1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (OLIG2 protein, human)', '0 (Olig2 protein, mouse)', '0 (Oligodendrocyte Transcription Factor 2)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Receptor, Notch1)', '0 (Receptors, Cell Surface)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', 'EC 3.4.- (Amyloid Precursor Protein Secretases)', 'EC 3.4.- (Endopeptidases)', 'EC 3.4.23.- (Aspartic Acid Endopeptidases)', 'EC 3.4.23.46 (BACE1 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.23.46 (Bace1 protein, mouse)']",,"['65/16/7151 [pii]', '10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-05-1400 [doi]']",,,,,PMC1681523,,,,,,,,,['NIHMS13508'],,

Comparison of different assays established micellar electrokinetic chromatography as a reliable method for the analysis of genomic methylation levels. When used for the determination of DNA methylation levels in bone marrow DNA from MDS patients during various time points of decitabine treatment, the results revealed a significant (up to 70%) demethylation in five of seven patients. Interestingly, genome-wide demethylation appeared after karyotype normalization, which suggests demethylation of nonclonal cells. Drug-induced demethylation dynamics were also confirmed by bisulfite sequencing of pericentromeric satellite elements. Our results are the first to show a genome-wide demethylating activity of decitabine in tumor material.

It is thought to have an antiangiogenic basis. However, whereas surprisingly durable and potent tumor responses have been observed in a number of preclinical tumor models, relapses usually eventually occur using this type of treatment strategy. We therefore decided to test modified metronomic chemotherapy regimens that might significantly delay such relapses, but still maintain modest and acceptable toxicity profiles. Here, we show that repeated administration of bolus doses (BDs) of cyclophosphamide every 3 or 6 weeks, combined with a daily oral low-dose metronomic (LDM) regimen (20 mg/kg/d cyclophosphamide), improves efficacy and significantly delays progression of transplanted PC-3 human prostate cancer xenografts, syngeneic transplanted EMT-6 breast tumors, and ""spontaneous"" murine erythroleukemia. Efficacy was superior whereas toxicity was mild and comparable to the LDM regimen, the latter assessed by body weight, neutrophil, lymphocyte, and total white blood counts. Antiangiogenic activity, measured by reduction in circulating endothelial precursor cells, revealed that the greatest degree of suppression occurred using the combination treatment. Overall, our results indicate that the administration of intermittent BD combined with chronic oral LDM cyclophosphamide is a potent treatment regimen for controlling tumor growth, which has a low toxicity profile, over prolonged periods of time.","['Shaked, Yuval', 'Emmenegger, Urban', 'Francia, Giulio', 'Chen, Limor', 'Lee, Christina R', 'Man, Shan', 'Paraghamian, Armen', 'Ben-David, Yaacov', 'Kerbel, Robert S']","['Shaked Y', 'Emmenegger U', 'Francia G', 'Chen L', 'Lee CR', 'Man S', 'Paraghamian A', 'Ben-David Y', 'Kerbel RS']","[""Department of Molecular and Cellular Biology, Sunnybrook and Women's College Health Sciences Centre and the Department of Medical Biophysics, University of Toronto, Ontario, Canada.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating/*administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Cyclophosphamide/*administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Endothelial Cells/cytology/drug effects', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Mammary Neoplasms, Experimental/*drug therapy', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Nude', 'Prostatic Neoplasms/*drug therapy', 'Stem Cells/cytology/drug effects', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",2005/08/17 09:00,2005/10/28 09:00,['2005/08/17 09:00'],"['2005/08/17 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/10/28 09:00 [medline]', '2005/08/17 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 2005 Aug 15;65(16):7045-51. doi: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-05-0765.,['CA-41233/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)']",,"['65/16/7045 [pii]', '10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-05-0765 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Because its half-life time is too short and it is easy to arouse allergic reaction, use in practical clinic is considerably limited. Silk fibroin (SF) with different molecular mass from 40 to 120 kDa is a natural biocompatible protein and could be used as a novel bioconjugate for enzyme modification to overcome its usual shortcomings mentioned above. When the enzyme was bioconjugated covalently with the water-soluble fibroin by glutaraldehyde, the enzyme kinetic properties and immune characteristics in vivo of the resulting silk fibroin-L-asparaginase (SF-ASNase) bioconjugates were investigated in detail. The results show that the modified ASNase was characterized by its higher residual activity (nearly 80%), increased heat and storage stability and resistance to trypsin digestion, and its longer half-life (63 h) than that of intact ASNase (33 h). The abilities of intact and modified ASNases to arouse allergic reaction are 2(4) and 2(1) antibody titers, respectively. Bioconjugation of silk fibroin significantly helps to reduce the immunogenicity and antigenicity of the enzyme. The apparent Michaelis constants of the modified ASNase (K(m(app))=0.844 x 10(-3)mol L(-1)) was approximately six times lower than that of enzyme alone, which suggests that the affinity of the enzyme to substrate l-asparagine elevated when bioconjugated covalently with silk fibroin.

Eighty-eight subjects were enrolled in this study, 24 patients with active pulmonary tuberculosis, 20 patients with HIV seropositive subjects, 24 patients with cancer, 12 patients with acute type lymphoblastic leukaemia, 12 patients with chronic type lymphoblastic leukaemia) patients and 20 healthy individuals. ADA activity was determined in serum samples using colorimetric method and plasma PF4 activity was measured by using a sandwich-type enzyme immunoassay. When all study groups were compared with the control group, mean serum ADA activities were found to be significantly (p<0.01) higher in the sera of patients with active pulmonary tuberculosis (median, range: 39 IU/l), HIV seropositive subjects (median, range: 31 IU/l) than in the sera of cancer patients (median, range: 15) and healthy controls (median, range: 32 IU/l). Plasma PF-4 activities in active pulmonary tuberculosis patients (median, range: 84 IU/ml) were found to be significantly elevated when compared to HIV seropositive subjects (median, range: 59 IU/ml), cancer patients (median, range 55 IU/ml) and healthy individuals (median, range: 56 IU/ml) (p<0.01). Serum ADA and plasma PF-4 activities showed significant alteration in patients with active pulmonary tuberculosis compared to patients with HIV seropositive subjects, cancer patients and healthy individuals. In conclusion, we suggest that serum ADA and PF-4 activities can be used in the diagnosis of tuberculosis as an supplementary laboratory test in combination with clinical and laboratory findings. Further controlled studies are necessary to determine the importance of the PF-4 and ADA activities in patients with active pulmonary tuberculosis, HIV seropositive subjects and cancer patients.","['Tarhan, Gulnur', 'Gumuslu, Feyzullah', 'Yilmaz, Neziha', 'Saka, Dilek', 'Ceyhan, Ismail', 'Cesur, Salih']","['Tarhan G', 'Gumuslu F', 'Yilmaz N', 'Saka D', 'Ceyhan I', 'Cesur S']","['Refik Saydam Hygiene Center, Tuberculosis Reference and Research Laboratory, Ankara, Turkey. gultarhan@hotmail.com']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",England,J Infect,The Journal of infection,7908424,IM,"['Adenosine Deaminase/*blood/metabolism', 'Adult', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Colorimetry', 'Female', 'HIV Antibodies/blood', 'HIV Seropositivity/*blood/enzymology/immunology', 'Humans', 'Immunoenzyme Techniques', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*blood/enzymology/immunology', 'Male', 'Mycobacterium tuberculosis/isolation & purification', 'Platelet Factor 4/*analysis/metabolism', 'Sputum/microbiology', 'Tuberculosis, Pulmonary/*blood/diagnosis/enzymology']",2005/08/17 09:00,2007/07/21 09:00,['2005/08/17 09:00'],"['2005/06/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2005/08/17 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/07/21 09:00 [medline]', '2005/08/17 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Infect. 2006 Apr;52(4):264-8. doi: 10.1016/j.jinf.2005.06.009.

According to this system, FAB low risk MDS (RA and RARS) were defined as such when the presence of dysplastic features was only restricted to the erythroid lineage, and new categories, refractory cytopenia with multilineage dysplasia (RCMD) and refractory cytopenia with multilineage dysplasia and ringed sideroblasts (RCMD-RS), were added. In a retrospective analysis of 240 consecutive patients diagnosed at our institution as having FAB RA and RARS, we reclassified the disease following the WHO criteria and we found that 179/214 patients (84%) still remained in the RA category, while 35/214 (16%) moved to RCMD. Moreover, 17/26 patients (65%) maintained the RARS diagnosis, whereas 9/26 (35%) were re-classified as RCMD-RS. We detected differences among the WHO subgroups as to age and sex distribution as well as to median survival observed by stratifying patients according to different prognostic scoring systems. Furthermore we confirmed the usefulness of WHO segregation with regard to its predictive value for evolution into acute leukaemia. Our study provides evidence that WHO classification may have prognostic impact on MDS subgroups which are usually categorized by FAB as having a favourable outcome.","['Breccia, Massimo', 'Carmosino, Ida', 'Biondo, Francesca', 'Mancini, Marco', 'Russo, Eleonora', 'Latagliata, Roberto', 'Alimena, Giuliana']","['Breccia M', 'Carmosino I', 'Biondo F', 'Mancini M', 'Russo E', 'Latagliata R', 'Alimena G']","['Department of Cellular Biotechnology and Hematology, University La Sapienza, Rome, Italy. breccia@bcc.uniroma.1.it']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*classification/mortality', 'Prognosis', 'World Health Organization']",2005/08/17 09:00,2006/03/03 09:00,['2005/08/17 09:00'],"['2005/05/26 00:00 [received]', '2005/06/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2005/08/17 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/03/03 09:00 [medline]', '2005/08/17 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 2006 Feb;30(2):178-82. doi: 10.1016/j.leukres.2005.06.015.

ELISA assay demonstrated that tocilizumab bound to sIL-6R and inhibited IL-6 binding to sIL-6R in a dose-dependent manner. The dissociation constant (Kd value) for IL-6R was determined to be 2.54+/-0.12 nmol/L by Scatchard analysis. In addition, tocilizumab had the ability to dissociate IL-6 and sIL-6R from their preformed complex. The immune complex of tocilizumab and sIL-6R did not transmit signaling. Moreover, tocilizumab suppressed the IL-6/sIL-6R complex-induced proliferation of human gp130-transfected cell, BAF-h130. In addition, tocilizumab had the ability to bind to human IL-6R expressing COS-7 cells and to suppress the growth of the IL-6-dependent myeloma cell line, KPMM2. Finally, to analyze the specificity of this antibody, the effects on signal transduction of IL-6 family cytokines such as interleukin-11 (IL-11), oncostatin M (OSM), leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), and ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF) were examined using murine transfectant cell lines (BaF/IL-6R, BaF/IL-11R, BaF/OSMR, BaF/LIFR and BaF/CNTFR) that proliferate depending on IL-6, IL-11, OSM, LIF and human CNTF, respectively. Tocilizumab inhibited the proliferation of BaF/IL-6R induced by IL-6, but did not inhibit the proliferation of BaF/IL-11R, BaF/OSMR, BaF/LIFR and BaF/CNTFR cells induced by their corresponding cytokines. These lines of evidence indicate that tocilizumab is able to bind to both sIL-6R and mIL-6R and to inhibit IL-6 binding to its receptors, leading to the blockade of the IL-6 signaling through both sIL-6R and mIL-6R, but not block the signaling of other IL-6 family cytokines.","['Mihara, Masahiko', 'Kasutani, Keiko', 'Okazaki, Makoto', 'Nakamura, Akito', 'Kawai, Shigeto', 'Sugimoto, Masamichi', 'Matsumoto, Yoshihiro', 'Ohsugi, Yoshiyuki']","['Mihara M', 'Kasutani K', 'Okazaki M', 'Nakamura A', 'Kawai S', 'Sugimoto M', 'Matsumoto Y', 'Ohsugi Y']","['Fuji-Gotemba Research Laboratories, Chugai Pharmaceutical Co.

Here, an inspection of this region revealed a novel 13-bp palindrome residing at position +8/+20. Interestingly, the palindrome contains the DNA consensus-binding hexamer for the RUNX/AML family of transcription factors that play a role in hematopoiesis, leukemia, and several developmental processes. Measuring the expression for promoter-reporter constructs after transfection revealed that deletion of the palindrome abrogated most of the proximal promoter activity in 293A cell. Additionally, electrophoretic mobility shift assays have shown that the palindrome could bind the RUNX1 component in nuclear extracts of myeloid cell lines exclusively through its RUNX motif. The palindrome was found in five additional human genes, two of which (MYH11 and MLLT1) have been linked to chromosomal rearrangements leading to leukemia. The data presented here have implicated, for the first time, RUNX/AML in the regulation of the uPA gene. The significance of the novel palindrome regarding gene regulation through the RUNX motif deserves further investigation.","['Kopf, E', 'Miskin, R']","['Kopf E', 'Miskin R']","['Department of Biological Chemistry, The Weizmann Institute of Science, Rehovot, Israel.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,J Thromb Haemost,Journal of thrombosis and haemostasis : JTH,101170508,IM,"['Amino Acid Motifs', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Line', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit/genetics/*physiology', 'DNA', '*Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes, Reporter', 'Humans', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/*genetics', 'Protein Binding', '*Repetitive Sequences, Nucleic Acid', 'Transfection', 'Urokinase-Type Plasminogen Activator/*genetics']",2005/08/17 09:00,2005/12/13 09:00,['2005/08/17 09:00'],"['2005/08/17 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/12/13 09:00 [medline]', '2005/08/17 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Thromb Haemost. 2005 Sep;3(9):2057-64. doi: 10.1111/j.1538-7836.2005.01510.x.,,"['0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (RUNX1 protein, human)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 3.4.21.73 (Urokinase-Type Plasminogen Activator)']",,"['JTH1510 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1538-7836.2005.01510.x [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Yet, most reports are anecdotical and scarce data are available on the risk of thrombosis in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the risk of thrombosis in patients with acute leukemia. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Three-hundred and seventy-nine consecutive adult patients with newly diagnosed acute leukemia were recruited in an observational cohort study conducted from January 1994 to December 2003. Diagnosis was ALL in 69 patients, acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL; FAB subtype M3) in 31, and non-M3 AML in 279. All first or recurrent symptomatic thromboembolic events objectively diagnosed were recorded. RESULTS: Twenty-four patients of the overall 379 (6.3%; 95% CI 4.1%-9.2%) had a first thrombosis, venous in 80% of the cases and arterial in 20%. At diagnosis, thrombosis was a presenting manifestation in 13 cases (3.4% of the whole cohort): 1.4% in ALL, 9.6% in APL, and 3.2% in non-M3 AML patients. Follow-up was carried out on 343 patients without thrombosis at diagnosis and further 11 thrombotic events (3.2%) were recorded. At 6 months from diagnosis, the cumulative incidence of thrombosis was 10.6% in ALL, 8.4% in APL, and 1.7% in non-M3 AML patients. The patients who received L-asparaginase had a 4.9-fold increased risk of thrombosis in comparison with those who did not (95% CI 1.5-16.0). The fatality rate due to thrombosis was 0.8%. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with acute leukemia, the risk of thrombosis is not negligible. Thombosis can be a presenting symptom at diagnosis in a significant portion of cases with APL (9.6%) and non-M3 AML (3.2%); a similar rate of thrombosis can occur during the subsequent course of the disease. The incidence of symptomatic thrombosis at diagnosis is relatively low in ALL patients (1.4%), but is significantly increased by further treatment up to 10.6%. Strategies of antithrombotic prophylaxis should be investigated in this setting.","['De Stefano, V', 'Sora, F', 'Rossi, E', 'Chiusolo, P', 'Laurenti, L', 'Fianchi, L', 'Zini, G', 'Pagano, L', 'Sica, S', 'Leone, G']","['De Stefano V', 'Sora F', 'Rossi E', 'Chiusolo P', 'Laurenti L', 'Fianchi L', 'Zini G', 'Pagano L', 'Sica S', 'Leone G']","['Institute of Hematology, Catholic University, Rome, Italy. destefano@rm.unicatt.it']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,J Thromb Haemost,Journal of thrombosis and haemostasis : JTH,101170508,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Asparaginase/adverse effects', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Leukemia/*complications/epidemiology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Risk', 'Thrombosis/epidemiology/*etiology']",2005/08/17 09:00,2005/12/13 09:00,['2005/08/17 09:00'],"['2005/08/17 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/12/13 09:00 [medline]', '2005/08/17 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Thromb Haemost. 2005 Sep;3(9):1985-92. doi: 10.1111/j.1538-7836.2005.01467.x.,,['EC 3.5.1.1 (Asparaginase)'],,"['JTH1467 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1538-7836.2005.01467.x [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Glanzmann thrombasthenia, is enabling us to learn much about the pathophysiology of integrins and of how alphaIIb beta3 functions. Bernard-Soulier syndrome, an example of macrothrombocytopenia, combines the production of large platelets with a deficit or non-functioning of the major adhesion receptor of platelets, the GPIb-IX-V complex. Amino acid substitutions in GPIb alpha, may lead to up-regulation and spontaneous binding of von Willebrand factor as in Platelet-type von Willebrand disease. In disorders with defects in the MYH9 gene, macrothrombocytopenias are linked to modifications in kidney, eye or ear, whereas other inherited thrombocytopenias variously link a low platelet count with a propensity to leukemia, skeletal defects, learning impairment, and abnormal red cells. Defects of secretion from platelets include an abnormal alpha-granule formation as in the gray platelet syndrome (with marrow myelofibrosis), and of organelle biogenesis in the Hermansky-Pudlak and Chediak-Higashi syndromes where platelet dense body defects are linked to abnormalities of other lysosomal-like organelles including melanosomes. Finally, defects involving surface receptors (P2Y(12), TPalpha) for activating stimuli, of proteins essential for signaling pathways (including Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome), and of platelet-derived procoagulant activity (Scott syndrome) show how studies on platelet disorders are helping unravel the pathways of primary hemostasis.","['Nurden, A T']",['Nurden AT'],"['Institut Federatif de Recherche N 4, CHU Bordeaux, Pessac, France. alan.nurden@cnrshl.u-bordeaux2.fr']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",England,J Thromb Haemost,Journal of thrombosis and haemostasis : JTH,101170508,IM,"['Bernard-Soulier Syndrome/blood', 'Blood Platelet Disorders/*blood/*diagnosis', 'Blood Platelets/metabolism', 'Coagulants', 'Genetic Therapy/methods', 'Humans', 'Integrins/metabolism', 'Megakaryocytes/cytology/metabolism/*physiology', 'Models, Biological', 'Platelet Aggregation', 'Protein Binding', 'Signal Transduction', 'Thrombasthenia/blood', 'Thrombocytopenia/blood', 'Up-Regulation', 'von Willebrand Factor/metabolism']",2005/08/17 09:00,2005/12/13 09:00,['2005/08/17 09:00'],"['2005/08/17 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/12/13 09:00 [medline]', '2005/08/17 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Thromb Haemost. 2005 Aug;3(8):1773-82. doi: 10.1111/j.1538-7836.2005.01428.x.,,"['0 (Coagulants)', '0 (Integrins)', '0 (von Willebrand Factor)']",100,"['JTH1428 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1538-7836.2005.01428.x [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In 1989, she was diagnosed with anemia that evolved until 1998, when a bone marrow biopsy revealed a myelodysplastic syndrome unclassified in French-American-British Group (FAB). The patient has required periodic transfusions since February 1999. A skin biopsy of the purpuric lesions revealed a leukocytoclastic vasculitis; the lesions cleared with topical corticosteroid treatment. In May 1999, the patient presented with inflammatory and painful lesions localized on the vulva (Fig. 2), which had evolved over several days, without fever. No lesions were observed in other locations. A cutaneous biopsy showed an intense dermal edema and a diffuse and polymorphous dermal infiltrate involving the follicular structures. Exocytosis, spongiosis, and mucin deposits, demonstrated by Alcian blue stain, were observed in the follicular epithelium. Mature neutrophils were predominant in the dermal infiltrate, but a small number of eosinophils and immature cells were also present (Fig. 3). The myelogenous origin of the immature lining cells was further confirmed by positive staining of intracytoplasmic granules with naphthol-ASD chloroacetate sterase (Leder's stain). Vasculitis was not observed. Routine laboratory tests revealed 3030 leukocytes/mm(3) (60% neutrophils), a hemoglobin level of 8.4 g/dL, and 92,000 platelets/mm(3). Treatment with 30 mg/day of prednisone was started, and the lesions cleared slowly within 4 weeks. A new bone marrow biopsy in September 1999 showed a similar appearance to that taken in 1998.

A 66-year-old man presented with a febrile syndrome that had evolved over 5 days, and painful and pruritic cutaneous lesions on the face and posterior neck (Fig. 4). Three months before, the patient was diagnosed with chronic myelogenous leukemia in acceleration phase. Examination revealed an edematous and erythematous face with pustular lesions on the surface, also involving the neck and the upper part of the back. The histopathologic examination revealed an intense edema and abscesses in the dermis. The infiltrate of these lesions was composed of mature neutrophils with the presence of abundant immature cells with a myelogenous aspect (Fig. 5). Analytical studies revealed 26,130 leukocytes/mm(3) (42% blasts). No specific treatment for Sweet's syndrome was administered and the lesions showed an improvement within 5 days.

The autosomal dominant form of this disease is caused by a polyalanine expansion from 10 to 12-17 residues, located at the N-terminus of the poly(A)-binding protein nuclear 1 (PABPN1). A distinct pathological hallmark of OPMD is the presence of filamentous intranuclear aggregates in patients' skeletal muscle cells. Wildtype PABPN1 protein is expressed ubiquitously and was shown to be mostly concentrated in discrete nuclear domains called 'speckles'. Using an established cell- culture model, we show that most mutant PABPN1- positive (alanine expanded form) intranuclear aggregates are structures distinct from intranuclear speckles. In contrast, the promyelocytic leukaemia protein, a major component of nuclear bodies, strongly colocalized to intranuclear aggregates of mutant PABPN1. Wildtype PABPN1 can freely shuttle between the nucleus and cytoplasm. We determined whether the nuclear environment is necessary for mutant PABPN1 inclusion formation and cellular toxicity. This was achieved by inactivating the mutant PABPN1 nuclear localization signal and by generating full-length mutant PABPN1 fused to a strong nuclear export sequence. A green fluorescence protein tag inserted at the N-terminus of both wildtype PABPN1 (ala10) and mutant PABPN1 (ala17) proteins allowed us to visualize their subcellular localization. Targeting mutant PABPN1 to the cytoplasm resulted in a significant suppression of both intranuclear aggregates formation and cellular toxicity, two histological consequences of OPMD. Our results indicate that the nuclear localization of mutant PABPN1 is crucial to OPMD pathogenesis.","['Abu-Baker, Aida', 'Laganiere, Simon', 'Fan, Xueping', 'Laganiere, Janet', 'Brais, Bernard', 'Rouleau, Guy A']","['Abu-Baker A', 'Laganiere S', 'Fan X', 'Laganiere J', 'Brais B', 'Rouleau GA']","['Center for Research in Neuroscience, McGill University, and the McGill University Health Center, 1650 Cedar Avenue, Montreal, Quebec, Canada H3G 1A4.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Traffic,"Traffic (Copenhagen, Denmark)",100939340,IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Survival', 'Cytoplasm/metabolism', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Inclusion Bodies/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'L-Lactate Dehydrogenase/analysis/metabolism', 'Microscopy, Fluorescence', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Muscular Dystrophy, Oculopharyngeal/*metabolism', 'Mutagenesis, Site-Directed', '*Mutation', 'Poly(A)-Binding Protein I/chemistry/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary']",2005/08/17 09:00,2005/10/26 09:00,['2005/08/17 09:00'],"['2005/08/17 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/10/26 09:00 [medline]', '2005/08/17 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Traffic. 2005 Sep;6(9):766-79. doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0854.2005.00315.x.,,"['0 (Poly(A)-Binding Protein I)', 'EC 1.1.1.27 (L-Lactate Dehydrogenase)']",,"['TRA315 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1600-0854.2005.00315.x [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It has been in clinical use for more than two decades and remains one of the most highly prescribed anticancer drugs in the world. The primary cytotoxic target for etoposide is topoisomerase II. This ubiquitous enzyme regulates DNA under- and overwinding, and removes knots and tangles from the genome by generating transient double-stranded breaks in the double helix. Etoposide kills cells by stabilizing a covalent enzyme-cleaved DNA complex (known as the cleavage complex) that is a transient intermediate in the catalytic cycle of topoisomerase II. The accumulation of cleavage complexes in treated cells leads to the generation of permanent DNA strand breaks, which trigger recombination/repair pathways, mutagenesis, and chromosomal translocations. If these breaks overwhelm the cell, they can initiate death pathways. Thus, etoposide converts topoisomerase II from an essential enzyme to a potent cellular toxin that fragments the genome. Although the topoisomerase II-DNA cleavage complex is an important target for cancer chemotherapy, there also is evidence that topoisomerase II-mediated DNA strand breaks induced by etoposide and other agents can trigger chromosomal translocations that lead to specific types of leukemia. Given the central role of topoisomerase II in both the cure and initiation of human cancers, it is imperative to further understand the mechanism by which the enzyme cleaves and rejoins the double helix and the process by which etoposide and other anticancer drugs alter topoisomerase II function.","['Baldwin, E L', 'Osheroff, N']","['Baldwin EL', 'Osheroff N']","['Department of Biochemistry, 654 Robinson Research Building, Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, Nashville, TN 37232-0146, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",Netherlands,Curr Med Chem Anticancer Agents,Current medicinal chemistry.

In tumor cells, constitutive MAPK activation affords increased proliferation and resistance to apoptotic stimuli, including classical cytotoxic drugs. In most instances, however, MAPK inhibition has cytostatic rather than cytotoxic effects, which may explain the lack of objective responses observed in early clinical trials of MEK inhibitors. Nevertheless, amenability of the MAPK pathway to pharmacodynamic evaluation and negligible clinical toxicity make MEK inhibitors an ideal platform to build pharmacological combinations with synergistic antitumor activity. In AML, the MEK/MAPK pathway is constitutively activated in the majority of cases (75%), conferring a uniformly poor prognosis; in preclinical models of AML, MEK blockade profoundly inhibits cell growth and proliferation and downregulates the expression of several anti-apoptotic players, thereby lowering the apoptotic threshold. Apoptosis induction, however, requires concentrations of MEK inhibitors much higher than those required to inhibit proliferation. Nevertheless, MEK blockade efficiently and selectively sensitizes leukemic cells to sub-optimal doses of other apoptotic stimuli, including classical cytotoxics (nucleoside analogs, microtubule-targeted drugs, gamma-irradiation), biologicals (retinoids, interferons, arsenic trioxide), and, most interestingly, other signal transduction/apoptosis modulators (UCN-01, STI571, Bcl-2 antagonists).

AIMS AND METHODS: The provincial health authority reported a high mortality rate from upper GI cancer in the center of Iran. A comprehensive search was undertaken to survey and register all cases of cancer during a 5-year (1998-2002) period among the indigenous population of Semnan Province. Diagnosis of cancer was based on histopathology, clinical or radiological findings, and death certificates. RESULTS: A total of 1732 patients with cancers (mean age 59.41% +/-19.08% years) were found during the study. Of these, 936(54.86%) were in males. Crude rates were 124.8/100,000 and 112.1/100,000 for males and females, respectively. Age-standardized ratios (ASRs) for all cancers in males and females were 156/100,000 and 136/100,000 person-year, respectively. Gastric cancer was the most common tumor with an incidence rate of 19.7 per 100,000 people (ASR=27.5). In upper gastrointestinal cancers, gastric cancer was the most common (47.17%), followed by colon malignancies (8.1%, 9.5 per 100,000 populations), esophagus (6.8%, 7.9 per 100,000 populations), liver (2.4%, and 2.8 per 100,000 populations). In women, breast, uterine and ovary, stomach and skin were the most common cancers. In the child population the most common tumors were of the brain, acute lymphocytic leukemia, and bone. CONCLUSION: Gastric cancer alone constitutes one-sixth of all cancers in Semnan, with the highest ASR incidence rate reported from Iran up to now.","['Babaei, Mehdi', 'Mousavi, Shahrokh', 'Malek, Mojtaba', 'Tosi, Gafar', 'Masoumeh, Zolfaghari', 'Danaei, Navid', 'Gafar, Gandaghi']","['Babaei M', 'Mousavi S', 'Malek M', 'Tosi G', 'Masoumeh Z', 'Danaei N', 'Gafar G']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Semnan University of Medical Sciences, Semnan, Iran. amo_babaei@yahoo.com']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Thailand,Asian Pac J Cancer Prev,Asian Pacific journal of cancer prevention : APJCP,101130625,IM,"['Female', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Iran/epidemiology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms/*epidemiology', 'Registries', 'Stomach Neoplasms/epidemiology', 'Surveys and Questionnaires']",2005/08/17 09:00,2005/09/21 09:00,['2005/08/17 09:00'],"['2005/08/17 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/09/21 09:00 [medline]', '2005/08/17 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Asian Pac J Cancer Prev. 2005 Apr-Jun;6(2):159-64.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

MATERIALS AND METHODS: The human promyelocytic leukemia cell line, HL-60, was exposed to nocodazole or etoposide in combination with proteasome or caspase inhibitors. Apoptotic cell death was detected by flow cytometry as sub-G1 population. Caspase and proteasome activities were monitored by the fluorogenic substrates Ac-DEVD-AMC and Suc-LLVY-AMC, respectively, in cell lysate. Heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) expression was determined by Western blotting. RESULTS: Nocodazole, a microtubule inhibitor, induced caspase-dependent apoptosis in the HL-60 cell line. At sub-cytotoxic concentrations, proteasome inhibitors, including MG-132 or clasto-beta-lactone, decreased nocodazole-induced apoptotic DNA fragmentation without affecting the induction of caspase-3 activity. In contrast, MG-132 decreased both DNA fragmentation and caspase activation induced by etoposide, a topoisomerase-II inhibitor. HSP70 had previously been found to inhibit apoptosis independently from caspase activation. In this study, MG-132 up-regulated HSP70 protein expression, both in the presence or absence of nocodazole. CONCLUSION: Proteasome inhibitors decreased anti-microtubule agent-induced apoptotic DNA fragmentation downstream of caspase-3 activation, possibly due to increased HSP70 expression. The results indicate that combination treatment with these novel anti-tumor agents in leukemia requires careful evaluation of their molecular interaction at the level of apoptosis induction.","['Nagy, Katalin', 'Petak, Istvan', 'Imre, Gergely', 'Barna, Gabor', 'Gezane-Csorba, Maria', 'Sebestyen, Anna', 'Houghton, Janet A', 'Mihalik, Rudolf', 'Kopper, Laszlo']","['Nagy K', 'Petak I', 'Imre G', 'Barna G', 'Gezane-Csorba M', 'Sebestyen A', 'Houghton JA', 'Mihalik R', 'Kopper L']","['First Department of Pathology and Experimental Cancer Research, Semmelweis University, Budapest, Hungary.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Greece,Anticancer Res,Anticancer research,8102988,IM,"['Amino Acid Chloromethyl Ketones/administration & dosage/pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects/physiology', 'Caspase Inhibitors', 'Caspases/*metabolism', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cysteine Proteinase Inhibitors/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Drug Interactions', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Etoposide/administration & dosage/pharmacology', 'HL-60 Cells', 'HSP70 Heat-Shock Proteins/biosynthesis', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*drug therapy/enzymology/pathology', 'Leupeptins/administration & dosage/pharmacology', 'Microtubules/drug effects', 'Nocodazole/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', '*Proteasome Inhibitors', 'Up-Regulation/drug effects']",2005/08/17 09:00,2005/10/14 09:00,['2005/08/17 09:00'],"['2005/08/17 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/10/14 09:00 [medline]', '2005/08/17 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Anticancer Res. 2005 Sep-Oct;25(5):3321-6.,"['CA 23944/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 32613/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 87952/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['0 (Amino Acid Chloromethyl Ketones)', '0 (Caspase Inhibitors)', '0 (Cysteine Proteinase Inhibitors)', '0 (HSP70 Heat-Shock Proteins)', '0 (Leupeptins)', '0 (Proteasome Inhibitors)', '0 (benzyloxycarbonylvalyl-alanyl-aspartyl fluoromethyl ketone)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'RF1P63GW3K (benzyloxycarbonylleucyl-leucyl-leucine aldehyde)', 'SH1WY3R615 (Nocodazole)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The 50% cytotoxic concentrations (CC50) for EUG, MMP, bis-EUG and bis-MMP were 0.38 mM, 0.38 mM, 0.18 mM and 0.20 mM, respectively. DNA fragmentation was induced most strongly by bis-EUG, followed by EUG, MMP and bis-MMP. The expression of MnSOD and, less strongly, Cu/ZnSOD activity, as assessed by acrylamide gel electrophoresis, was inhibited by EUG, suggesting mitochondrial dysfunction. The expression of the mRNAs for MnSOD and Cu/ZnSOD in HL-60 cells, as assessed by RT-PCR, was significantly inhibited by treatment with 1 mM EUG for 1 hour. Furthermore, inhibition of SOD mRNAs expression by EUG was strongly potentiated by the addition of 5 mM N-acetyl cysteine (NAC) or glutathione (GSH), whereas NAC or GSH alone did not affect the expression of SOD mRNAs. The cytotoxicity of EUG was significantly enhanced by high concentrations of NAC or GSH, which may be attributed to the inhibition of SOD mRNAs expression by the synergistic action of EUG and GSH or NAC. The regulatory effects of eugenol-related compounds on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) gene expression in RAW 264.7 cells were investigated by Northern blot analysis. Bis-EUG, MMP and bis-MMP inhibited COX-2 gene expression at concentrations of 300 microM, 500 microM and 500 microM, respectively. In contrast, no inhibitory effect of EUG was found over the wide concentration range of 10-500 microM, possibly as a result of the extensive mitochondrial dysfunction induced by this compound, which possesses potent pro-oxidative activity. Eugenol-related compounds, particularly bis-EUG, may act as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID)-like compounds.","['Okada, Norihisa', 'Hirata, Atsushi', 'Murakami, Yukio', 'Shoji, Masao', 'Sakagami, Hiroshi', 'Fujisawa, Seiichiro']","['Okada N', 'Hirata A', 'Murakami Y', 'Shoji M', 'Sakagami H', 'Fujisawa S']","['Department of Diagnosis and Therapeutic Sciences, Meikai University School of Dentistry, Sakado, Saitama 350-0283, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Greece,Anticancer Res,Anticancer research,8102988,IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Cyclooxygenase 2', 'Cyclooxygenase 2 Inhibitors', 'Cyclooxygenase Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'DNA Fragmentation', 'Enzyme Induction/drug effects', 'Eugenol/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic/drug effects', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Macrophages/cytology/drug effects/enzymology', 'Membrane Proteins', 'Mice', 'Nucleosomes/drug effects', 'Prostaglandin-Endoperoxide Synthases/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Superoxide Dismutase/biosynthesis/genetics']",2005/08/17 09:00,2005/10/14 09:00,['2005/08/17 09:00'],"['2005/08/17 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/10/14 09:00 [medline]', '2005/08/17 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Anticancer Res. 2005 Sep-Oct;25(5):3263-9.,,"['0 (Cyclooxygenase 2 Inhibitors)', '0 (Cyclooxygenase Inhibitors)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Nucleosomes)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '3T8H1794QW (Eugenol)', 'EC 1.14.99.1 (Cyclooxygenase 2)', 'EC 1.14.99.1 (PTGS2 protein, human)', 'EC 1.14.99.1 (Prostaglandin-Endoperoxide Synthases)', 'EC 1.15.1.1 (Superoxide Dismutase)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

An essential role has been attributed to subsequent activation of the Stat3 transcription factor in mediating LIF self-renewal response. To date, however, downstream target genes of Stat3 in ES cells are still unknown. To isolate these genes, we performed a microarray-based kinetic comparison of LIF-stimulated (undifferentiated) ES cells versus ES cells induced to differentiate by shutting down Stat3 activity through either LIF deprivation or, more specifically, expression of a Stat3 dominant-negative mutant. In each case, we chose the earliest time at which ES cells lose their self-renewal properties, as illustrated by a decrease in the number of embryoid bodies and blast cell colony formation as well as germ layer marker expression. Comparison of the two independent approaches revealed similarly regulated genes that are likely to be involved in the Stat3 effects on ES cell self-renewal. For instance, upregulation of growth factors such as the transforming growth factor-beta relative Lefty1 or transcriptional regulators such as Id1 and Id2 and down-regulation of the groucho-like protein Aes1 (grg5) were found.

The limited solubility of the recombinant protein produced in Escherichia coli led the authors to explore the use of Saccharomyces cerevisiae for expression of M-MuLV IN. IN was expressed in yeast and purified by chromatography on nickel-NTA agarose. IN migrated as a single band in SDS-PAGE and did not contain IN degradation products. The enzyme was about twofold more active than the enzyme purified from E. coli and was free of nucleases. Using the yeast system, the substitution of the putative catalytic amino acid Asp184 by alanine was also analysed. The mutated enzyme was inactive in the in vitro assays. This is the first direct demonstration that mutation of Asp184 inactivates M-MuLV IN. Finally, S. cerevisiae was used as a model to assess the ability of M-MuLV IN to interact with eukaryotic protein partners. The expression of an active M-MuLV IN in yeast strains deficient in RAD52 induced a lethal effect. This phenotype could be attributed to cellular damage, as suggested by the viability of cells expressing inactive D184A IN. Furthermore, when active IN was expressed in a yeast strain lacking the ySNF5 transcription factor, the lethal effect was abolished, suggesting the involvement of ySNF5 in the cellular damage induced by IN. These results indicate that S. cerevisiae could be a useful model to study the interaction of IN with cellular components in order to identify potential counterparts of the natural host.","['Vera, Jorge', 'Parissi, Vincent', 'Garcia, Andrea', 'Zuniga, Roberto', 'Andreola, Marie-Line', 'Caumont-Sarcos, Anne', 'Tarrago-Litvak, Laura', 'Leon, Oscar']","['Vera J', 'Parissi V', 'Garcia A', 'Zuniga R', 'Andreola ML', 'Caumont-Sarcos A', 'Tarrago-Litvak L', 'Leon O']","['Programa de Virologia, ICBM, Facultad de Medicina, Universidad de Chile, Independencia 1027, Santiago, Chile.', ""Bordeaux, F-33000 France; IFR 66 'Pathologies Infectieuses et Cancers', Bordeaux, F-33000 France. 146 rue Leo Saignat, 33076 Bordeaux cedex, France."", 'CNRS UMR 5097, Bordeaux, F-33000 France; Universite Victor Segalen Bordeaux 2, Bordeaux, F-33000 France. 146 rue Leo Saignat, 33076 Bordeaux cedex, France.', 'Programa de Virologia, ICBM, Facultad de Medicina, Universidad de Chile, Independencia 1027, Santiago, Chile.', 'Programa de Virologia, ICBM, Facultad de Medicina, Universidad de Chile, Independencia 1027, Santiago, Chile.', ""Bordeaux, F-33000 France; IFR 66 'Pathologies Infectieuses et Cancers', Bordeaux, F-33000 France. 146 rue Leo Saignat, 33076 Bordeaux cedex, France."", 'CNRS UMR 5097, Bordeaux, F-33000 France; Universite Victor Segalen Bordeaux 2, Bordeaux, F-33000 France. 146 rue Leo Saignat, 33076 Bordeaux cedex, France.', ""Bordeaux, F-33000 France; IFR 66 'Pathologies Infectieuses et Cancers', Bordeaux, F-33000 France. 146 rue Leo Saignat, 33076 Bordeaux cedex, France."", 'CNRS UMR 5097, Bordeaux, F-33000 France; Universite Victor Segalen Bordeaux 2, Bordeaux, F-33000 France. 146 rue Leo Saignat, 33076 Bordeaux cedex, France.', ""Bordeaux, F-33000 France; IFR 66 'Pathologies Infectieuses et Cancers', Bordeaux, F-33000 France. 146 rue Leo Saignat, 33076 Bordeaux cedex, France."", 'CNRS UMR 5097, Bordeaux, F-33000 France; Universite Victor Segalen Bordeaux 2, Bordeaux, F-33000 France. 146 rue Leo Saignat, 33076 Bordeaux cedex, France.', 'Programa de Virologia, ICBM, Facultad de Medicina, Universidad de Chile, Independencia 1027, Santiago, Chile.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,J Gen Virol,The Journal of general virology,0077340,IM,"['Animals', 'Chromosomal Proteins, Non-Histone', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Eukaryotic Cells/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Viral', '*Genetic Vectors', '*Integrases/genetics/isolation & purification/metabolism', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/*enzymology/genetics', 'Mutagenesis', 'Saccharomyces cerevisiae/*enzymology/genetics/growth & development', 'Saccharomyces cerevisiae Proteins', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/metabolism']",2005/08/16 09:00,2005/09/15 09:00,['2005/08/16 09:00'],"['2005/08/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/09/15 09:00 [medline]', '2005/08/16 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Gen Virol. 2005 Sep;86(Pt 9):2481-2488. doi: 10.1099/vir.0.81006-0.,,"['0 (Chromosomal Proteins, Non-Histone)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (SNF5 protein, S cerevisiae)', '0 (Saccharomyces cerevisiae Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', 'EC 2.7.7.- (Integrases)']",,['10.1099/vir.0.81006-0 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,10.1099/vir.0.81006-0 [doi]

Despite proper binding of the targeted vector to the target molecule, little or no infectivity of human cells expressing the target molecule has been achieved in most studies. One of the reasons for this lack of infectivity may be steric hindrance within the targeted envelope glycoprotein (Env), impeding the conformational changes required for fusion and infection. Here, attempts were made to solve this problem by mutating key residues within Env of two targeted MoMLV-based vectors, MoMLV-E-Sel and MoMLV-FBP. Selection of key residues was based on an Env with reduced threshold for fusion, that of the CD4-independent human immunodeficiency virus type 2 isolate ROD/B. It was shown here that vectors bearing MoMLV-FBP Env with a V512M substitution had higher titres and faster kinetics of entry than vectors bearing parental targeted Env proteins. This could be due to the partial release of steric constraints that result in an Env with a reduced threshold for fusion.","['Viejo-Borbolla, A', 'Thomas, P', 'Blair, E D', 'Schulz, T F']","['Viejo-Borbolla A', 'Thomas P', 'Blair ED', 'Schulz TF']","['Department of Medical Microbiology and Genitourinary Medicine, University of Liverpool, Liverpool, UK.', 'Department of Virology, Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany.', 'Departments of Applied Diagnostics and Computational Chemistry, GlaxoSmithKline, Medicines Research Centre, Stevenage, UK.', 'Departments of Applied Diagnostics and Computational Chemistry, GlaxoSmithKline, Medicines Research Centre, Stevenage, UK.', 'Departments of Applied Diagnostics and Computational Chemistry, GlaxoSmithKline, Medicines Research Centre, Stevenage, UK.', 'Department of Virology, Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany.', 'Department of Medical Microbiology and Genitourinary Medicine, University of Liverpool, Liverpool, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,J Gen Virol,The Journal of general virology,0077340,IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Amino Acid Substitution', 'Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Gene Products, env/*chemistry/*genetics/metabolism', '*Genetic Vectors', 'Humans', 'Image Processing, Computer-Assisted', 'Membrane Fusion/*physiology', 'Mice', 'Models, Molecular', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/chemistry/genetics/*pathogenicity', 'Mutation', 'NIH 3T3 Cells', 'Protein Conformation']",2005/08/16 09:00,2005/09/15 09:00,['2005/08/16 09:00'],"['2005/08/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/09/15 09:00 [medline]', '2005/08/16 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Gen Virol. 2005 Sep;86(Pt 9):2469-2480. doi: 10.1099/vir.0.81057-0.,,"['0 (Gene Products, env)']",,['10.1099/vir.0.81057-0 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,10.1099/vir.0.81057-0 [doi]

Recently, the HLA-A24-restricted mHag ACC-1 and the HLA-B44-restricted mHag ACC-2 encoded by separate polymorphisms within the BCL2A1 gene were characterized. Hematopoietic-restricted expression was suggested for these mHags. We demonstrate BCL2-related protein A1 (BCL2A1) mRNA expression in mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) that was up-regulated by the inflammatory cytokines tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) and/or interferon gamma (IFN-gamma). Analysis of cytotoxicity and IFN-gamma production illustrated that ACC-2-specific T cells did not recognize untreated MSCs or IFN-gamma-treated MSCs but showed specific recognition and killing of MSCs treated with TNF-alpha plus IFN-gamma. We hypothesize that under steady-state circumstances BCL2A1-specific T cells may exhibit relative specificity for hematopoietic tissue, but reactivity against nonhematopoietic cells may occur when inflammatory infiltrates are present. Thus, the role of BCL2A1-specific T cells in differential induction of GVL reactivity and GVHD may depend on the presence of inflammatory responses that may occur during GVHD.","['Kloosterboer, Freke M', 'van Luxemburg-Heijs, Simone A P', 'van Soest, Ronald A', 'van Egmond, H M Esther', 'Willemze, Roel', 'Falkenburg, J H Frederik']","['Kloosterboer FM', 'van Luxemburg-Heijs SA', 'van Soest RA', 'van Egmond HM', 'Willemze R', 'Falkenburg JH']","['Department of Hematology, Leiden University Medical Center, C2-R, PO Box 9600, 2300 RC Leiden, The Netherlands. f.m.kloosterboer@lumc.nl']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Cytokines/immunology', 'Graft vs Host Disease/*immunology', 'Graft vs Leukemia Effect/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy', 'Inflammation/immunology', 'Interferon-gamma/immunology', 'Leukemia/*immunology/therapy', 'Male', 'Minor Histocompatibility Antigens/genetics/*immunology', 'Polymorphism, Genetic', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/genetics/*immunology', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Stromal Cells/immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/*immunology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/immunology', 'Up-Regulation']",2005/08/16 09:00,2006/01/19 09:00,['2005/08/16 09:00'],"['2005/08/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/01/19 09:00 [medline]', '2005/08/16 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 2005 Dec 1;106(12):3955-7. doi: 10.1182/blood-2004-09-3749.

There was no excess mortality from all causes combined among chrome-exposed persons. A minimal excess of cancer (SMR=112), overall, was due primarily to an excess of lung cancer (SMR=141) but the SMR was 112 among the better-quality, smoking-controlled studies.

Recently, increased bone marrow angiogenesis, measured as, e.g. microvascular density (MVD), was reported to be more intense in high-risk than in low-risk MDS. To assess the prognostic role of MVD in MDS, a cohort of 56 patients, thoroughly investigated for various clinical and morphological parameters, were followed-up for survival > or =60 months after the diagnostic analysis. As a group MDS patients had higher MVD compared to healthy controls (p<0.02). The highest median MVD value was observed in the RAEB group, but there was no overall significant difference between the FAB groups. No significant correlations were observed between MVD and peripheral blood counts, bone marrow cellularity, percentage of bone marrow blasts and CD34 positive cells, apoptotic index (TUNEL), proliferation index (MIB-1), erythroid index, FAB group and IPSS score. MVD was not correlated to overall survival. In contrast, bone marrow blast count <5%, low or normal cellularity, as well as a high erythroid index, indicated a favorable survival.

The influence on stem cell behaviour is not known and so this study will explore whether sintered carbonated apatites are favourable for propagation of stem cells. Different weight substitutions of carbonated apatite, specifically 2.5 wt% (2.5 wt%CAP) and 5 wt% (5 wt%CAP), were sintered and characterised prior to the investigation of their potential as a matrix for the support of mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells. Characterisation of the apatites included elemental analysis, X-ray diffraction, surface roughness, specific surface area, density, and solubility. The ability of carbonated apatite to support mouse ES cell colonisation and maintenance in the presence of leukaemia inhibitory factor was determined by an enumeration of live versus dead cells within a population, and immunoreactivity to Oct4, a transcription factor and stem cell marker, following growth on each matrix.

Leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), bone morphogenetic proteins, octamer-binding protein 3 or 4, and Nanog are important factors in the maintenance of pluripotency in mouse ES cells. However, the mechanisms by which these factors regulate the pluripotency remain poorly understood. To identify other proteins involved in this process, we did a proteomic analysis of mouse ES cells that were cultured in the presence or absence of LIF. More than 100 proteins were found to be involved specifically in either the differentiation process or the maintenance of undifferentiated state. Among these, chromatin-related proteins were identified as the major proteins in nuclear extracts of undifferentiated cells. Analysis with real-time RT-PCR revealed that enrichment of these proteins in pluripotent ES cells was regulated at the transcriptional levels. These results suggest that specific chromatin-related proteins may be involved in maintaining the unique properties of pluripotent ES cells.","['Kurisaki, Akira', 'Hamazaki, Tatsuo S', 'Okabayashi, Koji', 'Iida, Tetsuo', 'Nishine, Tsutomu', 'Chonan, Ritsu', 'Kido, Hiroshi', 'Tsunasawa, Susumu', 'Nishimura, Osamu', 'Asashima, Makoto', 'Sugino, Hiromu']","['Kurisaki A', 'Hamazaki TS', 'Okabayashi K', 'Iida T', 'Nishine T', 'Chonan R', 'Kido H', 'Tsunasawa S', 'Nishimura O', 'Asashima M', 'Sugino H']","['The Institute for Enzyme Research, University of Tokushima, 3-18-15, Kuramoto, Tokushima 770-8503, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Biochem Biophys Res Commun,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,0372516,IM,"['Animals', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chromatin/*physiology', '*Down-Regulation', 'Embryo, Mammalian/cytology/*metabolism', 'Interleukin-6/*metabolism', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Mice', 'Pluripotent Stem Cells/cytology/*metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Spectrometry, Mass, Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption-Ionization']",2005/08/16 09:00,2005/11/08 09:00,['2005/08/16 09:00'],"['2005/07/06 00:00 [received]', '2005/07/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2005/08/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/11/08 09:00 [medline]', '2005/08/16 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Biochem Biophys Res Commun. 2005 Sep 30;335(3):667-75. doi: 10.1016/j.bbrc.2005.07.128.,,"['0 (Chromatin)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)']",,"['S0006-291X(05)01613-X [pii]', '10.1016/j.bbrc.2005.07.128 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this report, short-chain fatty acid derivatives (SCFADs) which induce fetal globin gene expression were tested for their ability to promote proliferation and survival of erythroid progenitors cultured from beta-thalassemic subjects, and of cytokine-dependent erythroid cell lines. Certain SCFADs promoted thalassemic Bfu-e growth and cytokine-independent growth and survival of erythroid cell lines. A 40-80% increase in erythroid Bfu-e colony number was observed in cultures established with any of five mitogenic SCFADs, compared to control or butyrate-treated cultures from the same subjects. Immunoblot analysis demonstrated that these same SCFADs also regulated the expression of specific protein inhibitors of apoptosis. Anti-apoptotic ratios of the proteins Bcl-xL/Bcl-xS in thalassemic Bfu-e were increased by 30-120% with exposure to the SCFDs, compared to the ratios in the same cells cultured under control conditions. Similar anti-apoptotic increases in Mcl-1L/Mcl-1S ratios were induced by the SCFADs. These findings suggest that select fetal globin-inducing SCFADs which enhance proliferation of beta-thalassemia progenitors may enhance survival of these progenitors by altering levels of Bcl-family protein members. This combination of effects should enhance erythroid cell survival in the beta-thalassemia syndromes, allowing fetal globin gene expression to be induced more effectively than currently available, growth-suppressing, fetal globin-inducing agents, such as the butyrates or chemotherapeutic agents.","['Castaneda, Serguei', 'Boosalis, Michael S', 'Emery, David', 'Thies, Allison', 'Faller, Douglas V', 'Perrine, Susan P']","['Castaneda S', 'Boosalis MS', 'Emery D', 'Thies A', 'Faller DV', 'Perrine SP']","['Hemoglobinopathy-Thalassemia Research Unit and Cancer Research Center, Boston University School of Medicine, 715 Albany Street, L-908, Boston, MA 02118, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood Cells Mol Dis,"Blood cells, molecules & diseases",9509932,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cytokines/pharmacology', 'Erythroid Precursor Cells/drug effects/metabolism/*pathology', 'Fatty Acids, Volatile/*pharmacology', 'Gene Expression Regulation/drug effects', 'Mice', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Neoplasm Proteins/analysis/drug effects', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/analysis/drug effects', 'bcl-X Protein/analysis/*genetics', 'beta-Thalassemia/*blood/genetics']",2005/08/16 09:00,2006/02/01 09:00,['2005/08/16 09:00'],"['2005/04/18 00:00 [received]', '2005/06/02 00:00 [revised]', '2005/06/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2005/08/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/02/01 09:00 [medline]', '2005/08/16 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood Cells Mol Dis. 2005 Sep-Oct;35(2):217-26. doi: 10.1016/j.bcmd.2005.06.007.,"['R01 HL061208/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA084193/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'DK-643535/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 DK052962/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'DK-52962/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-84193/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL-61208/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R42 DK064535/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States']","['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Fatty Acids, Volatile)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (bcl-X Protein)']",,"['S1079-9796(05)00100-2 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bcmd.2005.06.007 [doi]']",,,,,PMC4260805,,,,,,,,,['NIHMS535946'],,

Compared to adult cancers, childhood cancers' particularities justify to create pediatric registries. The first French population-based registry was created in Lorraine in 1983. The incidence and survival results from a 17 year-period are presented. METHODS: In Lorraine region, all children (0-14 years) with cancer diagnosed between 1983 and 1999 were included. Crude, age-standardized (world population) and cumulative incidence rates were calculated just as overall, specific-disease and event-free survival rates, using Kaplan-Meier methods. RESULTS: With 1086 registered cases, the crude incidence rate per million children is 132.4, the age-standardized incidence rate per million is 137.5; 1 out of every 500 children will develop cancer before the age of 15 years. The incidence of all cancers combined is slightly higher in males than in females with a M/F ratio of 1.13. For this 17 years-period, no trend in childhood cancer incidence is observed. The main cancer groups are leukemia (30.7%), brain and spinal tumors (23.2%) and lymphomas (12.9%), sympathetic nervous system tumors (7.4%), soft-tissue sarcomas (6.1%), renal tumors (5.2%), and bone tumors (5.0%). Five-year specific survival rates for all cancers combined is 71.4% [95% CI: 68.5-74.3]. The prognosis is significatively worse for the<1 year age group (55%) and for some histologic types: brain stem gliomas (27%), hepatic tumors (43%), osteosarcomas (57%), neuroblastomas (65%), rhabdomyosarcomas (55%). DISCUSSION: Relative distribution of histologic groups, incidence and survival rates observed in Lorraine registry are compatible with the general pattern in the European Union cancer registries. The lack of significative trend in incidence unlike others country may be explained by too small numbers. CONCLUSION: The acquired experience in developping this regional registry allowed us to create a national registry of childhood solid tumors and contribute to valid national data.","['Lacour, B', 'Desandes, E', 'Mallol, N', 'Sommelet, D']","['Lacour B', 'Desandes E', 'Mallol N', 'Sommelet D']","[""Registre lorrain des cancers de l'enfant, CHU, Vandoeuvre-les-Nancy, France. brigitte.lacour@medecine.uhp-nancy.fr""]",['fre'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",France,Arch Pediatr,Archives de pediatrie : organe officiel de la Societe francaise de pediatrie,9421356,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child Welfare', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'France/epidemiology', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/*epidemiology/*mortality', 'Registries/*statistics & numerical data', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival']",2005/08/16 09:00,2005/12/13 09:00,['2005/08/16 09:00'],"['2005/03/04 00:00 [received]', '2005/06/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2005/08/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/12/13 09:00 [medline]', '2005/08/16 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Arch Pediatr. 2005 Nov;12(11):1577-86. doi: 10.1016/j.arcped.2005.06.010.

Particle integrity and envelope incorporation are unaffected; rather, the defect is functional and intrinsic to the viral core. Light in the violet part of the visible spectrum (wavelength 420-430 nm) is responsible for virus inactivation. Reduced reverse transcriptase-dependent cDNA generation post-entry accounts for the loss in infectivity and is likely due to a polymerase processivity defect. The virion-associated reverse transcription complex is thus photolabile. The phenomenon could be important in certain experimental situations, notably at elevated temperatures or when exposure to light is extensive.

May; Uckan D, Hicsonmez G, Yetgin S, Gurgey A, Cetin M, Karaagaoglu E, et al. CD34/CD117 co-expression in childhood acute leukemia. Leukemia Res 2000;24:201-6.). We describe the case of a 22 month-old-girl with MDS and Down syndrome who was presented with severe anemia and thrombocytosis at diagnosis, transformed into AML-M7. In our patient, CD34 and CD117 markers were positive on the blast cells of the BM 6 months before the chemotherapy decision. As the disease progressed, CD34/117 co-existence was increased and MDS transformed into AML. As a result, an increase in CD34 and CD117 positivity of the BM blast cells may be associated with a higher risk of leukemic transformation.","['Tavil, Betul', 'Cetin, Mualla', 'Tuncer, Murat']","['Tavil B', 'Cetin M', 'Tuncer M']","['Pediatric Hematolog Unit, Hacettepe University Faculty of Medicine, 06100 Ankara, Turkey. betultavil@yahoo.com']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,IM,"['Antigens, CD34/*analysis', 'Bone Marrow Examination', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/etiology', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*complications/immunology', 'Prognosis', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit/*analysis']",2005/08/16 09:00,2006/03/03 09:00,['2005/08/16 09:00'],"['2005/06/14 00:00 [received]', '2005/08/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/03/03 09:00 [medline]', '2005/08/16 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 2006 Feb;30(2):222-4. doi: 10.1016/j.leukres.2005.06.019.

This system was shown to be effective for tolerance induction with a variety of inserted antigens ranging in size from a single peptide to a large multi-epitope protein in a variety of mouse strains. Moreover, it was shown to be effective in four animal models for human disease. To optimize the existing protocol, establish the role of the IgG H chain scaffold, and provide baseline for potential clinical applications, we examined the effects of different B-cell activators, including lipopolysaccharide (LPS), anti-CD40, CpG oligodeoxynucleotide (CpG-ODN), and anti-IgM plus IL-4, on B-cell proliferation, GFP transduction efficiency, and tolerance induction in vivo. The results show that all activators except CpG-ODN have similar effects on retroviral gene transfer and peptide-IgG-induced tolerance. Furthermore, dose-response analyses showed that T-cell tolerance could be induced with 10(5) peptide-IgG LPS B-cell blasts, but that 10(6) transduced B-cells were needed for humoral unresponsiveness. Transduced anti-IgM-induced blasts were tolerogenic at 10(6) cells, but no dose of transduced CpG blasts was tolerogenic. Finally, to examine the role of IgG scaffold, a retroviral construct encoding lambda repressor p1-102 and signal peptide of murine IgG heavy chain was engineered to allow secretion of the p1-102 domain in the same manner as that of p1-102-IgG fusion protein. The results demonstrate that not only is IgG scaffold important in tolerance induction and maintenance of the long-lasting immune hyporesponsiveness, but assembly of the IgG heterodimer may be required for the efficacy of this system.","['Lei, Tie Chi', 'Su, Yan', 'Scott, David W']","['Lei TC', 'Su Y', 'Scott DW']","['Department of Surgery and of Microbiology and Immunology, University of Maryland School of Medicine, Rockville, MD 20855, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Netherlands,Cell Immunol,Cellular immunology,1246405,IM,"['*Adoptive Transfer', 'Animals', 'B-Lymphocytes/immunology/*transplantation', '*Genetic Therapy', 'Genetic Vectors', 'Immune Tolerance/*genetics', 'Immunoglobulin G/*genetics/physiology', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/*genetics/physiology', 'Lymphocyte Activation/genetics', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/genetics/immunology', 'Peptides/genetics/immunology', 'Transduction, Genetic']",2005/08/16 09:00,2005/12/13 09:00,['2005/08/16 09:00'],"['2005/02/01 00:00 [received]', '2005/06/06 00:00 [revised]', '2005/06/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2005/08/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/12/13 09:00 [medline]', '2005/08/16 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cell Immunol. 2005 May;235(1):12-20. doi: 10.1016/j.cellimm.2005.06.007.

Moreover, differences in intracellular calcium cell localization between S and R cells were found ultrastructurally following a calcium precipitating cytochemical method. In S cells, calcium precipitates were found to be localized predominantly along the cell surface coat and within mitochondria delineating the cristae. In R cells, precipitates were also found inside nuclei, at the border of heterochromatin clumps, and scattered within the cytoplasm. High extracellular calcium did not influence the P-gp mediated extrusion of calcein/AM as P-gp substrate.

The extent of neuroendocrine differentiation in prostate cancer correlates with aggressive disease and with progression to HRPC. Plasma CgA levels in patients with prostate cancer may reflect the extent of the tumor neuroendocrine phenotype. METHODS: Pretreatment plasma was collected from 390 patients with metastatic HRPC enrolled in the Cancer and Leukemia Group B (CALGB) 9480 trial, a study of three different doses of suramin. Plasma CgA levels were determined in 321 samples in duplicate using a quantitative sandwich immunoassay. The proportional hazards model was used to assess the prognostic significance of CgA in predicting overall survival. RESULTS: The median plasma CgA level was 12 U/L (interquartile range 7.7 to 19.3). In univariate analysis, plasma CgA correlated inversely with survival times, with a survival time of 17 months for low CgA (less than 12 U/L, 95% CI 14 to 19) compared with 11 months for high CgA (95% CI 8 to 14, P = 0.014) and at all exploratory cutpoints, including CgA of 9.5 U/L or less versus greater than 9.5 U/L, with survival of 19 months compared with 12 months (P = 0.0015). In multivariate models (adjusting for performance status, prostate-specific antigen, and lactate dehydrogenase), the plasma CgA levels remained predictive of overall survival. CONCLUSIONS: These results support the hypothesis that serum CgA levels correlate with outcome in patients with HRPC, although the clinical significance needs to be established in confirmatory studies before incorporation of CgA measurements in clinical practice.","['Taplin, Mary-Ellen', 'George, Daniel J', 'Halabi, Susan', 'Sanford, Ben', 'Febbo, Philip G', 'Hennessy, Kristen T', 'Mihos, Christos G', 'Vogelzang, Nicholas J', 'Small, Eric J', 'Kantoff, Philip W']","['Taplin ME', 'George DJ', 'Halabi S', 'Sanford B', 'Febbo PG', 'Hennessy KT', 'Mihos CG', 'Vogelzang NJ', 'Small EJ', 'Kantoff PW']","['Lank Center for Genitourinary Oncology, Dana Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, Massachusetts 02115, USA. mtaplin@partners.org']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Urology,Urology,0366151,IM,"['Adenocarcinoma/*blood/drug therapy/*mortality', 'Aged', 'Chromogranin A', 'Chromogranins/*blood', 'Clinical Trials, Phase III as Topic', 'Hormones/therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Prognosis', 'Prostatic Neoplasms/*blood/drug therapy/*mortality', 'Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic', 'Survival Rate']",2005/08/16 09:00,2005/12/13 09:00,['2005/08/16 09:00'],"['2004/08/23 00:00 [received]', '2005/03/01 00:00 [revised]', '2005/03/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2005/08/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/12/13 09:00 [medline]', '2005/08/16 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Urology. 2005 Aug;66(2):386-91. doi: 10.1016/j.urology.2005.03.040.,,"['0 (CHGA protein, human)', '0 (Chromogranin A)', '0 (Chromogranins)', '0 (Hormones)']",,"['S0090-4295(05)00351-1 [pii]', '10.1016/j.urology.2005.03.040 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It has been shown that MKL1 functions as a RhoA-regulated transcriptional coactivator of serum response factor (SRF). In order to identify a protein that regulates the function of MKL1, we performed yeast two-hybrid screening and isolated cDNA that encodes UBC9, an E2 enzyme of small ubiquitin-related modifier-1 (SUMO-1), as an MKL1-binding protein. UBC9 was found to physically interact with MKL1 by GST pull-down assay, and MKL1 was covalently modified with SUMO-1 in 293T cells and in vitro reconstitution system. MKL1 sumoylation is enhanced by either serum stimulation or co-expression of constitutively active form of RhoA. Mutational analysis showed that lysine residues at 499, 576, and 624 are the major acceptor sites for SUMO-1. In addition, reporter gene analysis revealed that mutation of the three sumoylation sites strongly enhances the transcriptional activity of MKL1. The covalent attachment of SUMO-1 to MKL1 by gene fusion represses MKL1-dependent transcription in a complementary manner. Finally, mutation of the sumoylation sites of MKL1 also enhances SRF-dependent transcription without affecting MKL1-SRF interaction. The combined results demonstrated that MKL1 is sumoylated and this modification represses transcriptional activity of MKL1.","['Nakagawa, Koji', 'Kuzumaki, Noboru']","['Nakagawa K', 'Kuzumaki N']","['Division of Cancer Gene Regulation, Research Section of Disease Control, Institute for Genetic Medicine, Hokkaido University, Sapporo 060-0815, Japan. nakagawa@igm.hokudai.ac.jp']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Genes Cells,Genes to cells : devoted to molecular & cellular mechanisms,9607379,IM,"['Cells, Cultured', 'Cycloheximide/pharmacology', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Down-Regulation', 'Genes, Reporter', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Megakaryoblastic, Acute/*metabolism', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/genetics/metabolism', 'SUMO-1 Protein/*metabolism', 'Serum Response Factor/metabolism', 'Time Factors', '*Transcription, Genetic', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Two-Hybrid System Techniques', 'Ubiquitin-Conjugating Enzymes/metabolism', 'rhoA GTP-Binding Protein/metabolism']",2005/08/16 09:00,2005/12/13 09:00,['2005/08/16 09:00'],"['2005/08/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/12/13 09:00 [medline]', '2005/08/16 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Genes Cells. 2005 Aug;10(8):835-50. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2443.2005.00880.x.,,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (SUMO-1 Protein)', '0 (Serum Response Factor)', '98600C0908 (Cycloheximide)', 'EC 2.3.2.23 (Ubiquitin-Conjugating Enzymes)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (rhoA GTP-Binding Protein)', 'EC 6.3.2.- (ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme UBC9)']",,"['GTC880 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1365-2443.2005.00880.x [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It examines the differing ways in which those involved in researching, treating, and raising funds for work on childhood cancers have understood and used the language of cure, and speculates as to why talking about the 'cure' of survivors of childhood cancers is so problematic. The paper discusses the particular importance of holistic care in the development of paediatric oncology. Psychosocial support is delivered alongside surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy. The focus for support is the patient's whole family, building a tenet of palliative care into curative treatment. The concept of the 'truly cured child' is argued to have been crucial in the discipline's decision in the 1970s and 1980s to make the psychosocial needs of patients and their families central in the programme of curing children with cancer.","['Barnes, E']",['Barnes E'],"['Centre for the History of Science, Technology, and Medicine, Simon Building, University of Manchester, Manchester, UK. emm.barnes@man.ac.uk']",['eng'],"['Historical Article', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Eur J Cancer Care (Engl),European journal of cancer care,9301979,,"['Charities', 'Child', 'Child Health Services/history/*organization & administration', 'Family', 'History, 20th Century', 'Holistic Health', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/drug therapy/therapy', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local', 'Neoplasms/drug therapy/mortality/*therapy', 'Palliative Care/methods', 'Parents', 'Research/history', 'Social Support', 'Terminology as Topic', 'Treatment Outcome', 'United Kingdom']",2005/08/16 09:00,2006/03/03 09:00,['2005/08/16 09:00'],"['2005/08/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/03/03 09:00 [medline]', '2005/08/16 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Eur J Cancer Care (Engl). 2005 Sep;14(4):373-80. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2354.2005.00598.x.,['Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom'],,,"['ECC598 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1365-2354.2005.00598.x [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In 242 consecutive and untreated CLL patients, the percentage of CD38+ cases, according to the 7%, 20% and 30% cut-off points, was 21%, 17% and 14%, respectively. Using the 7% threshold, CD38 positivity correlated with male sex, intermediate and high-risk (Rai I-IV) disease, lower Hb and platelet levels, and higher lymphocyte count. Furthermore, patients with a CD38 expression>or=7% showed a significantly lower 3-year probability of treatment-free survival (TFS) than CD38- patients (P<0.0001). At multivariate analysis, CD38 expression remained significantly associated to TFS, together with stage, lymphocyte count and morphology. Also, in the 146 patients with stage 0 CLL a CD38 expression>or=7% identified a subgroup of patients with a significantly lower 3-year probability of TFS (P=0.0005). Furthermore, this parameter did not change in 30 of 31 (97%) re-evaluated patients. In conclusion, this study indicates that, when tested at diagnosis and on fresh material, a CD38 expression>or=7% is an important parameter for the identification of early CLL patients with more aggressive disease and that its expression remains stable over time.","['Gentile, Massimo', 'Mauro, Francesca Romana', 'Calabrese, Elisabetta', 'De Propris, Maria Stefania', 'Giammartini, Elena', 'Mancini, Francesca', 'Milani, Maria Laura', 'Guarini, Anna', 'Foa, Robin']","['Gentile M', 'Mauro FR', 'Calabrese E', 'De Propris MS', 'Giammartini E', 'Mancini F', 'Milani ML', 'Guarini A', 'Foa R']","['Division of Haematology, Dipartimento di Biotecnologie Cellulari ed Ematologia, University La Sapienza, Rome, Italy. massimogentile@virgilio.it']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,IM,"['ADP-ribosyl Cyclase/*blood', 'ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1', 'Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antigens, CD/*blood', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*blood', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Hemoglobins/analysis', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*blood/immunology', 'Lymphocyte Count', 'Male', 'Membrane Glycoproteins', 'Middle Aged', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Platelet Count', 'Prognosis', 'Prospective Studies', 'Sex Factors']",2005/08/16 09:00,2005/09/24 09:00,['2005/08/16 09:00'],"['2005/08/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/09/24 09:00 [medline]', '2005/08/16 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2005 Aug;130(4):549-57. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.2005.05659.x.,,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Hemoglobins)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', 'EC 3.2.2.5 (ADP-ribosyl Cyclase)', 'EC 3.2.2.5 (CD38 protein, human)', 'EC 3.2.2.6 (ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1)']",,"['BJH5659 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1365-2141.2005.05659.x [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have retrospectively measured soluble syndecan-1 in 324 presentation samples and 154 plateau phase samples from the UK Medical Research Council Myeloma VIth trial. Log-rank analysis showed that the presentation value of soluble syndecan-1 is a highly significant prognostic factor when assessing survival from entry (chi2=14.92, P<0.0001) and remains an important independent prognostic factor when considered in Cox regression models (P<or=0.02) with known independent factors. The magnitude of fall in soluble syndecan-1 from presentation to plateau also had prognostic value when assessing overall survival from plateau (chi2=3.79, P=0.05).

As eosinophils are potent effector cells contributing to allergic inflammation and asthma, we investigated whether the pro-apoptotic agent Viscum album agglutinin-I (VAA-I) could induce eosinophil apoptosis. VAA-I was found to induce apoptosis in eosinophilic AML14.3D10 (3D10) cells and that these cells expressed caspases-1, -2, -3, -4, -7, -8, -9 and -10. VAA-I-induced gelsolin degradation was reversed by the pan-caspase inhibitor N-benzyloxycarbonyl-V-A-D-O-methylfluoromethyl ketone (z-VAD). Also, paxillin, vimentin and lamin B1 were cleaved by caspases in VAA-I-induced 3D10 cells. VAA-I activated caspase-3 and -8 in 3D10 cells but, unlike z-VAD, treatment with a caspase-8 inhibitor slightly reversed apoptosis. Treatment of purified human eosinophils with VAA-I was found to induce apoptosis, degradation of gelsolin and lamin B1, but unlike 3D10 cells, cleavage of lamin B1 and cell apoptosis was not reversed by z-VAD. We conclude that VAA-I is a potent inducer of eosinophil apoptosis and that proteases other than those inhibited by z-VAD in 3D10 cells are involved in VAA-I-induced peripheral blood eosinophil apoptosis and lamin B1 cleavage. Thus, VAA-I represents a potential candidate for the reduction of the number of eosinophils in diseases where they play important roles.","['Lavastre, Valerie', 'Chiasson, Sonia', 'Cavalli, Helene', 'Girard, Denis']","['Lavastre V', 'Chiasson S', 'Cavalli H', 'Girard D']","['INRS-Institut Armand-Frappier, Universite du Quebec, Pointe-Claire, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Apoptosis', 'Caspase 3', 'Caspase 8', 'Caspases/analysis/*metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cytoskeletal Proteins/analysis/drug effects/*metabolism', 'DNA Fragmentation', 'Eosinophils/metabolism', 'Gelsolin/analysis/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Laminin/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*metabolism', 'Paxillin', 'Phosphoproteins/analysis/metabolism', 'Plant Preparations/*pharmacology', 'Plant Proteins/*pharmacology', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Ribosome Inactivating Proteins', 'Ribosome Inactivating Proteins, Type 2', 'Toxins, Biological/*pharmacology', 'Vimentin/analysis/metabolism']",2005/08/16 09:00,2005/09/24 09:00,['2005/08/16 09:00'],"['2005/08/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/09/24 09:00 [medline]', '2005/08/16 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2005 Aug;130(4):527-35. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.2005.05633.x.,,"['0 (Cytoskeletal Proteins)', '0 (Gelsolin)', '0 (LAMB1 protein, human)', '0 (Laminin)', '0 (PXN protein, human)', '0 (Paxillin)', '0 (Phosphoproteins)', '0 (Plant Preparations)', '0 (Plant Proteins)', '0 (Ribosome Inactivating Proteins, Type 2)', '0 (Toxins, Biological)', '0 (VAA-I protein, Viscum album)', '0 (Vimentin)', 'EC 3.2.2.22 (Ribosome Inactivating Proteins)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP8 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 8)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",,"['BJH5633 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1365-2141.2005.05633.x [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This report will review our current knowledge on normal and LSC development and examine the impact of these discoveries may have clinically and in our understanding of the leukaemogenic process.","['Bonnet, Dominique']",['Bonnet D'],"['Haematopoietic Stem Cell Laboratory, Cancer Research UK, London Research Institute, London, UK. dominique.bonnet@cancer.org.uk']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Cell Cycle', 'Cell Lineage', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Genes, Homeobox', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/genetics/pathology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*pathology', 'Mutation', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*pathology']",2005/08/16 09:00,2005/09/24 09:00,['2005/08/16 09:00'],"['2005/08/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/09/24 09:00 [medline]', '2005/08/16 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2005 Aug;130(4):469-79. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.2005.05596.x.,['HL-64856-03/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States'],,116,"['BJH5596 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1365-2141.2005.05596.x [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

For this purpose, isolated human islets were treated with d-siRNA (diced small interfering RNA) and then exposed to the nitric oxide donor DETA/NONOate [2,2'-(hydroxynitrosohydrazono)bis-ethanamine]. We observed that cells treated with p38alpha-specific d-siRNA, but not with d-siRNA targeting GL3 (a firefly luciferase siRNA plasmid) or PKCdelta (protein kinase Cdelta), were protected against nitric oxide-induced death. This was paralleled by an increased level of Bcl-XL (B-cell leukaemia/lymphoma-X long). For an in-depth study of the mechanisms of p38 activation, MKK3 (MAPK kinase 3), MKK6 and their dominant-negative mutants were overexpressed in insulin-producing RIN-5AH cells. In transient transfections, MKK3 overexpression resulted in increased p38 phosphorylation, whereas in stable MKK3-overexpressing RIN-5AH clones, the protein levels of p38 and JNK (c-Jun N-terminal kinase) were decreased, resulting in unaffected phospho-p38 levels. In addition, a long-term MKK3 overexpression did not affect cell death rates in response to the cytokines interleukin-1beta and interferon-gamma, whereas a short-term MKK3 expression resulted in increased cytokine-induced RIN-5AH cell death. The MKK3-potentiating effect on cytokine-induced cell death was abolished by a nitric oxide synthase inhibitor, and MKK3-stimulated p38 phosphorylation was enhanced by inhibitors of phosphatases. Finally, as the dominant-negative mutant of MKK3 did not affect cytokine-induced p38 phosphorylation, and as wild-type MKK3 did not influence p38 autophosphorylation, it may be that p38 is activated by MKK3/6-independent pathways in response to cytokines and nitric oxide. In addition, it is likely that a long-term increase in p38 activity is counteracted by both a decreased expression of the p38, JNK and p42 genes as well as an increased dephosphorylation of p38.","['Makeeva, Natalia', 'Myers, Jason W', 'Welsh, Nils']","['Makeeva N', 'Myers JW', 'Welsh N']","['Department of Medical Cell Biology, Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Biochem J,The Biochemical journal,2984726R,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Death/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cytokines/*pharmacology', 'Down-Regulation', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic', 'Humans', 'Insulin/biosynthesis/*metabolism', 'Insulin-Secreting Cells/*cytology/*drug effects/enzymology/metabolism', 'Isoenzymes/genetics/metabolism', 'Jurkat Cells', 'MAP Kinase Kinase 3/genetics/*metabolism', 'MAP Kinase Kinase 6/genetics/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 9/metabolism', 'Nitric Oxide/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Phosphorylation', 'Rats', 'Rats, Sprague-Dawley', 'p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/genetics/*metabolism']",2005/08/16 09:00,2006/03/17 09:00,['2005/08/16 09:00'],"['2005/08/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/03/17 09:00 [medline]', '2005/08/16 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Biochem J. 2006 Jan 1;393(Pt 1):129-39. doi: 10.1042/BJ20050814.,,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Insulin)', '0 (Isoenzymes)', '31C4KY9ESH (Nitric Oxide)', 'EC 2.7.1.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 9)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.12.2 (MAP Kinase Kinase 3)', 'EC 2.7.12.2 (MAP Kinase Kinase 6)']",,"['BJ20050814 [pii]', '10.1042/BJ20050814 [doi]']",,,,,PMC1383671,,,,,,,,,,,

The photosensitizer was highly potent, killing cells at low nanomolar concentrations upon exposure to activating light. The cellular uptake of lemuteporfin was rapid, with maximum levels reached within 20 min. Mitogen-activated lymphoid cells accumulated more of the lemuteporfin than their quiescent equivalents, supporting selectivity. Photosensitizer fluorescence in the skin increased rapidly within the first few minutes following intravenous administration to mice, then decreased over the next 24 h. Skin photosensitivity reactions indicated rapid clearance of the photosensitizer. Intravenous doses as low as 1.4 micromol/kg combined with exposure to 50 J/cm2 red light suppressed tumor growth in a mouse model. In conclusion, this new benzoporphyrin was found to be an effective photosensitizer, showing rapid uptake and clearance both in vitro and in vivo. This rapid photosensitization of tumors could be useful in therapies requiring a potent, rapidly accumulating photosensitizer, while minimizing the potential for skin photosensitivity reactions to sunlight following treatment.","['Boch, Ron', 'Canaan, Alice J', 'Cho, Angela', 'Dolphin, David D', 'Hong, Lina', 'Jain, Ashok K', 'North, John R', 'Richter, Anna M', 'Smits, Claire', 'Sternberg, Ethan D']","['Boch R', 'Canaan AJ', 'Cho A', 'Dolphin DD', 'Hong L', 'Jain AK', 'North JR', 'Richter AM', 'Smits C', 'Sternberg ED']","['QLT Inc., 887 Great Northern Way, Vancouver, BC, Canada, V5T 4T5. rboch@qltinc.com']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Photochem Photobiol,Photochemistry and photobiology,0376425,IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*chemistry/toxicity', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Ethylene Glycols/*chemistry/toxicity', 'Hematoporphyrins', 'Leukemia L1210/pathology', 'Mice', 'Photochemotherapy', 'Porphyrins/*chemistry/toxicity', 'Spectrophotometry']",2005/08/16 09:00,2006/06/14 09:00,['2005/08/16 09:00'],"['2005/08/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/06/14 09:00 [medline]', '2005/08/16 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Photochem Photobiol. 2006 Jan-Feb;82(1):219-24. doi: 10.1562/2005-06-03-RA-564.,,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Ethylene Glycols)', '0 (Hematoporphyrins)', '0 (Porphyrins)', '61BR964293 (diethylene glycol)', 'EZ109VJ012 (lemuteporfin)']",,"['2005-06-03-RA-564 [pii]', '10.1562/2005-06-03-RA-564 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Fever is frequent in neutropenic patients and often related to infection. Clinically, the presence of infection in patients with neutropenia may be difficult to establish, because there are usually few signs of infection. The aim of this work was to study sensitive markers for early diagnosis of microbial infection in neutropenic children undergoing intensive chemotherapy as a treatment for acute lymphoblastic leukaemia. The study included three groups (A, B and C) of children with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia and neutropenia. Group A consisted of 29 children with febrile neutropenia and microbial infection, aged 1-14 years (5.8+/-2.9), 11 boys and 18 girls; Group B of 38 children with febrile neutropenia without microbial infection, aged 2-14 years (6.8+/-3.1), 14 boys and 24 girls; and Group C of 53 children with neutropenia without fever and without infection, aged 1-14 years (5.9+/-2.1), 21 boys and 32 girls. Blood samples were collected upon admission and before the start of any antimicrobial treatment. The samples were used for blood culture, serological tests, leukocyte count and analysis of levels of C-reactive protein, procalcitonin, total adenosine deaminase (ADA) activity and its isoenzymes, ADA-1 and ADA-2. According to our results the procalcitonin levels and total ADA activity discriminated best between neutropenic febrile (Groups A and B) and neutropenic afebrile episodes (Group C). In conclusion, this study suggests procalcitonin and total ADA activity as two easily measurable and cost effective markers for the assessment of immune response in febrile neutropenic patients with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia.","['Hitoglou-Hatzi, S', 'Hatzistilianou, M', 'Gougoustamou, D', 'Rekliti, A', 'Agguridaki, Ch', 'Athanassiadou, F', 'Frydas, S', 'Kotsis, A', 'Catriu, D']","['Hitoglou-Hatzi S', 'Hatzistilianou M', 'Gougoustamou D', 'Rekliti A', 'Agguridaki Ch', 'Athanassiadou F', 'Frydas S', 'Kotsis A', 'Catriu D']","['Laboratory of General Biology, Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, Zefxidos 3, 54-622 Thessaloniki, Greece. nontas@topo.auth.gr']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Italy,Clin Exp Med,Clinical and experimental medicine,100973405,IM,"['Adenosine Deaminase/*blood', 'Adolescent', 'Calcitonin/*blood', 'Calcitonin Gene-Related Peptide', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Fever/*blood/enzymology', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Neutropenia/*blood/enzymology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*blood/enzymology/immunology', 'Protein Precursors/*blood']",2005/08/13 09:00,2005/11/01 09:00,['2005/08/13 09:00'],"['2005/01/10 00:00 [received]', '2005/05/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2005/08/13 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/11/01 09:00 [medline]', '2005/08/13 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Clin Exp Med. 2005 Jul;5(2):60-5. doi: 10.1007/s10238-005-0067-2.,,"['0 (CALCA protein, human)', '0 (Protein Precursors)', '9007-12-9 (Calcitonin)', 'EC 3.5.4.4 (Adenosine Deaminase)', 'JHB2QIZ69Z (Calcitonin Gene-Related Peptide)']",,['10.1007/s10238-005-0067-2 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Those involving the mixed lineage leukaemia (MLL) gene are found in various guises and it is unclear whether MLL fusions can affect haematopoietic differentiation. We have used a model in which chromosomal translocations are generated in mice de novo by Cre-loxP-mediated recombination (translocator mice) to compare the functionally relevant haematopoietic cell contexts for Mll fusions, namely pluripotent stem cells, semicommitted progenitors or committed cells. Translocations between Mll and Enl or Af9 cause myeloid neoplasias, initiating in pluripotent stem cells or multipotent myeloid progenitors. However, while Mll-Enl translocations can also cause leukaemia from T-cell progenitors, no tumours arose with Mll-Af9 translocations in the T-cell compartment. Furthermore, Mll-Enl translocations in T-cell progenitors can cause lineage reassignment into myeloid tumours. Therefore, a permissive cellular environment is required for oncogenicity of Mll-associated translocations and Mll fusions can influence haematopoietic lineage commitment.","['Drynan, Lesley F', 'Pannell, Richard', 'Forster, Alan', 'Chan, Nicole M M', 'Cano, Florencia', 'Daser, Angelika', 'Rabbitts, Terence H']","['Drynan LF', 'Pannell R', 'Forster A', 'Chan NM', 'Cano F', 'Daser A', 'Rabbitts TH']","['MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology, Cambridge, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,EMBO J,The EMBO journal,8208664,IM,"['Animals', 'Bone Marrow Cells/metabolism/pathology', 'Cell Lineage/physiology', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/genetics/metabolism/*pathology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase', 'Integrases/genetics/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/metabolism/pathology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/metabolism/pathology', 'Mice', 'Multipotent Stem Cells/metabolism/pathology', 'Myeloid Progenitor Cells/metabolism/pathology', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein', 'Nuclear Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/genetics/metabolism', 'Pluripotent Stem Cells/metabolism/pathology', 'Proto-Oncogenes/genetics', '*Recombination, Genetic', 'T-Lymphocytes/metabolism/pathology', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Translocation, Genetic/genetics/*physiology']",2005/08/13 09:00,2005/10/26 09:00,['2005/08/13 09:00'],"['2005/05/04 00:00 [received]', '2005/07/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2005/08/13 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/10/26 09:00 [medline]', '2005/08/13 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,EMBO J. 2005 Sep 7;24(17):3136-46. doi: 10.1038/sj.emboj.7600760.

The role of two common polymorphisms at the MTHFR gene, C677T and A1298C, in the etiology of childhood or adult acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) has been previously investigated. Although a protective effect of MTHFR*677T against ALL was systematically reported, the magnitude of the effect appeared to be influenced by population-specific gene-environmental interactions. The evidence of the role of MTHFR*1298C in ALL susceptibility was less consistent, emphasizing the need for enlarging molecular epidemiologic studies to independent trials from different populations. The authors analyzed in North Portugal the association between variations at the two MTHFR positions and risk of ALL by comparing genotypes and gene frequencies in 103 affected children with those in 111 healthy controls. None of the variations was found to significantly affect the risk of developing childhood ALL in North Portugal, and this finding per se is of relevance in further studies aimed at assessing the etiology of the pathology in this specific population. Despite the absence of statistical significance, these data revealed that the frequency of MTHFR*677T was lower in patients than in controls, a result that is congruent with other reports and with the functional model usually invoked to explain its ALL protective effect. Concerning MTHFR1298*C, this study failed to corroborate previous findings of decreased risk of ALL in the presence of the variant.","['Oliveira, Elisabete', 'Alves, Sandra', 'Quental, Sofia', 'Ferreira, Fatima', 'Norton, Lucilia', 'Costa, Vitor', 'Amorim, Antonio', 'Prata, Maria Joao']","['Oliveira E', 'Alves S', 'Quental S', 'Ferreira F', 'Norton L', 'Costa V', 'Amorim A', 'Prata MJ']","['Institute of Molecular Pathology and Immunology of the University of Porto, Porto, Portugal. eoliveira@ipatimup.pt']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol,Journal of pediatric hematology/oncology,9505928,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'Female', 'Genotype', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Methylenetetrahydrofolate Reductase (NADPH2)/*genetics', '*Polymorphism, Genetic', 'Portugal', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/etiology/*genetics']",2005/08/13 09:00,2005/09/21 09:00,['2005/08/13 09:00'],"['2005/08/13 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/09/21 09:00 [medline]', '2005/08/13 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol. 2005 Aug;27(8):425-9. doi: 10.1097/01.mph.0000177513.81465.94.,,['EC 1.5.1.20 (Methylenetetrahydrofolate Reductase (NADPH2))'],,"['00043426-200508000-00004 [pii]', '10.1097/01.mph.0000177513.81465.94 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

INTERVENTIONS: Administration of hydroxyurea and imatinib mesylate. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The patient was admitted to the neurosciences critical care unit with an acute nontraumatic subdural hematoma that required emergent surgical evacuation. His clinical course was notable for neurologic deterioration, sepsis, hyperleukocytosis, severe hypoxemia, and prolonged mechanical ventilation. An inverse relationship was observed between arterial oxygen tension and the magnitude of hyperleukocytosis. Hypoxemia resolved after the institution of chemotherapy and normalization of white cell count. Pulse oximeter saturation was normal throughout. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with hyperleukocytosis are at risk for severe hypoxemia, which may be real or spurious. Failure to recognize spurious hypoxemia can lead to unnecessary diagnostic tests and therapeutic interventions, exposing patients to avoidable risk.

Signaling by hematopoietic growth factors, such as GM-CSF, results in activation of CREB and upregulation of CREB target genes. Data from our laboratory shows that a majority of patients with acute lymphoid and myeloid leukemia overexpress CREB in the bone marrow. CREB overexpression is associated with poor initial outcome of clinical disease in AML patients. To study its role in hematopoiesis, we overexpressed CREB in leukemia cell lines and in mice. CREB overexpression resulted in increased survival and proliferation of myeloid cells and blast-transformation of bone marrow progenitor cells from transgenic mice expressing CREB in the myeloid lineage. CREB transgenic mice also develop myeloproliferative disease after one year. Thus, CREB acts as a proto-oncogene to regulate hematopoiesis and contributes to the leukemia phenotype. Our results suggest that CREB-dependent pathways may serve as targets for directed therapies in leukemia in the future.","['Kinjo, Kentaro', 'Sandoval, Salemiz', 'Sakamoto, Kathleen M', 'Shankar, Deepa B']","['Kinjo K', 'Sandoval S', 'Sakamoto KM', 'Shankar DB']","[""Division of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, Mattel Children's Hospital, Jonsson Comprehensive Cancer Center, Los Angeles, California, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Cell Cycle,"Cell cycle (Georgetown, Tex.)",101137841,IM,"['Animals', 'Bone Marrow Cells/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cell Survival', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'Cyclic AMP Response Element-Binding Protein/metabolism/*physiology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Glucose/metabolism', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/metabolism', '*Hematopoiesis', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Neoplasms/metabolism', 'Phenotype', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Mas', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/chemistry', 'Signal Transduction', 'Up-Regulation']",2005/08/13 09:00,2006/06/13 09:00,['2005/08/13 09:00'],"['2005/08/13 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/06/13 09:00 [medline]', '2005/08/13 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cell Cycle. 2005 Sep;4(9):1134-5. doi: 10.4161/cc.4.9.1991.

These proteins are also known as gp130 cytokines because they all share gp130 as a common transducer protein within their functional receptor complexes. Several of these cytokines (LIF, OSM, CNTF, and CT-1) also utilize the LIF receptor (LIFR) as a component of their receptor complex. We have shown that all of these cytokines are capable of activating both the JAK/STAT and p42/44 mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling pathways in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. By performing a variety of preincubation studies and examining the ability of these cytokines to activate STATs, ERKs, and induce transcription of SOCS-3 mRNA, we have also examined the ability of gp130 cytokines to modulate the action of their family members. Our results indicate that a subset of gp130 cytokines, in particular CT-1, LIF, and OSM, has the ability to impair subsequent signaling activity initiated by gp130 cytokines. However, IL-6 and CNTF do not exhibit this cross-talk ability. Moreover, our results indicate that the cross-talk among gp130 cytokines is mediated by the ability of these cytokines to induce ligand-dependent degradation of the LIFR, in a proteasome-independent manner, which coincides with decreased levels of LIFR at the plasma membrane. In summary, our results demonstrate that an inhibitory cross-talk among specific gp130 cytokines in 3T3-L1 adipocytes occurs as a result of specific degradation of LIFR via a lysosome-mediated pathway.","['Zvonic, Sanjin', 'Baugh, James E Jr', 'Arbour-Reily, Patricia', 'Mynatt, Randall L', 'Stephens, Jacqueline M']","['Zvonic S', 'Baugh JE Jr', 'Arbour-Reily P', 'Mynatt RL', 'Stephens JM']","['Department of Biological Sciences, Louisiana State University, Baton Rouge, Louisiana 70803, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,IM,"['Adipocytes/*physiology', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'Cell Membrane/physiology', 'Cytokine Receptor gp130/*physiology', 'Cytokines/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor Receptor alpha Subunit', 'Ligands', 'Lysosomes', 'Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex', 'RNA, Messenger', 'Receptor Cross-Talk/*physiology', 'Receptors, Cytokine/*metabolism', 'Receptors, OSM-LIF', 'Transcription, Genetic']",2005/08/13 09:00,2005/12/13 09:00,['2005/08/13 09:00'],"['2005/08/13 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/12/13 09:00 [medline]', '2005/08/13 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2005 Oct 7;280(40):33856-63. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M508020200.

Recent studies have revealed that the human tumor viruses Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV), human papillomavirus (HPV), hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), and human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1) express proteins that are targeted to mitochondria.

Consistent with the central role of mitochondria in energy production, cell death, calcium homeostasis, and redox balance, experimental evidence indicates that these proteins have profound effects on host cell physiology. In particular, the viral BCL-2 homologues BHRF1 and KSBCL-2 inhibit apoptosis triggered by a variety of stimuli. HBx, p7, E1[wedge]4, and p13(II) exert powerful effects on mitochondria either directly due to their channel-forming activity or indirectly through interactions with endogenous channels.

DESIGN AND METHODS: Two hundred and sixty-six bone marrow (BM) samples from 326 patients enrolled in the LMA-99 protocol from the CETLAM group were studied by multiparametric flow cytometry. Immunophenotyping studies were performed on erythrocyte-lysed BM samples. Antigen expression of leukemic cells was analyzed using triple stainings with fluorochrome-conjugated combinations of monoclonal antibodies. RESULTS: CD2 was positive in 21 cases (8%); an associated inv(16) was detected in eight CD2+ cases (38%). Two-year overall survival (OS) rate for CD2+/inv(16)+ patients was 75%, whereas it was 0% for CD2+/inv(16)- patients and 47% for CD2- patients (p=0.0001). CD36 was expressed in 37% of patients (n=98). Two-year leukemia-free survival (LFS) rate was 34% for CD36+ patients and 55% for CD36- patients (p=0.001). In the multivariate analysis, CD2+ (RR=8.4; p=0.0001) and adverse karyotype (RR=10.2; p=0.0001) were associated with a lower CR rate, CD36+ (RR=1.5; p=0.03), CD2+ (RR=2; p=0.04) and adverse karyotype (RR=4; p=0.0001) were associated with a lower OS and CD36+ (RR=2; p=0.002) and adverse karyotype (RR=3.5; p=0.005) predicted a lower LFS.

First, we developed a new similarity measure for comparing glycan structures taking into account the characteristic mechanisms of glycan biosynthesis, and we tested its ability to classify glycans of different blood components in the framework of support vector machines (SVMs). The results show that our method can successfully classify glycans from four types of human blood components: leukemic cells, erythrocyte, serum, and plasma. Next, we extracted characteristic functional motifs of glycans considered to be specific to each blood component. We predicted the substructure alpha-D-Neup5Ac-(2-->3)-beta-D-Galp-(1-->4)-D-GlcpNAc as a leukemia specific glycan motif. Based on the fact that the Agrocybe cylindracea galectin (ACG) specifically binds to the same substructure, we conducted an experiment using cell agglutination assay and confirmed that this fungal lectin specifically recognized human leukemic cells.","['Hizukuri, Yoshiyuki', 'Yamanishi, Yoshihiro', 'Nakamura, Osamu', 'Yagi, Fumio', 'Goto, Susumu', 'Kanehisa, Minoru']","['Hizukuri Y', 'Yamanishi Y', 'Nakamura O', 'Yagi F', 'Goto S', 'Kanehisa M']","['Bioinformatics Center, Institute for Chemical Research, Kyoto University, Gokasho, Uji, Kyoto 611-0011, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Netherlands,Carbohydr Res,Carbohydrate research,0043535,IM,"['*Biomarkers, Tumor', '*Computational Biology/methods', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*metabolism', 'Polysaccharides/blood/*chemistry/classification/isolation & purification']",2005/08/13 09:00,2005/12/13 09:00,['2005/08/13 09:00'],"['2005/06/14 00:00 [received]', '2005/07/19 00:00 [revised]', '2005/07/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2005/08/13 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/12/13 09:00 [medline]', '2005/08/13 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Carbohydr Res. 2005 Oct 17;340(14):2270-8. doi: 10.1016/j.carres.2005.07.012.,,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Polysaccharides)']",,"['S0008-6215(05)00355-1 [pii]', '10.1016/j.carres.2005.07.012 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, little is known about the contribution of the FGFs identified within the past 10 years to leukemogenesis. To elucidate whether these FGFs (FGF-8, -9, -10, -11, -12, -13, -14, -16, -17, -18, -19, -20, and -21) are expressed in leukemic cells, we performed RT-PCR analyses using 28 cell lines. The members of a fetal-oncogenic subfamily, FGF-8/-17/-18, were often expressed (53.5%, 25.0%, and 32.1%) with the co-expression of their receptors. Realtime quantitative-PCR analysis showed that FGF-8/-17 were aberrantly expressed in patients with acute leukemia. Moreover, cell proliferation assays revealed the proliferation activity of FGF-17 on leukemic cells expressing its receptors. These results demonstrated that certain recently identified FGFs play an important role in the growth of leukemic cells, possibly with an autocrine mode of action, and that these FGFs will become novel biomarkers for hematopoietic tumors.","['Nezu, Masahiko', 'Tomonaga, Takeshi', 'Sakai, Chikara', 'Ishii, Akihiro', 'Itoga, Sakae', 'Nishimura, Miki', 'Matsuo, Yoshinobu', 'Tagawa, Masatoshi', 'Nomura, Fumio']","['Nezu M', 'Tomonaga T', 'Sakai C', 'Ishii A', 'Itoga S', 'Nishimura M', 'Matsuo Y', 'Tagawa M', 'Nomura F']","['Department of Molecular Diagnosis, Graduate School of Medicine, Chiba University, 1-8-1 Inohana, Chuo-ku, Chiba 260-8670, Japan. mnezu@faculty.chiba-u.jp']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Biochem Biophys Res Commun,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,0372516,IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/genetics/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'DNA Primers', 'Fibroblast Growth Factors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Humans', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction']",2005/08/13 09:00,2005/11/08 09:00,['2005/08/13 09:00'],"['2005/07/25 00:00 [received]', '2005/07/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2005/08/13 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/11/08 09:00 [medline]', '2005/08/13 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Biochem Biophys Res Commun. 2005 Sep 30;335(3):843-9. doi: 10.1016/j.bbrc.2005.07.153.,,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (DNA Primers)', '62031-54-3 (Fibroblast Growth Factors)']",,"['S0006-291X(05)01643-8 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bbrc.2005.07.153 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

At 5, 8, 16, and 36 wk of age, chickens were tested for viremia, serum-neutralizing antibody, and cloacal shedding. Chickens were also monitored for development of neoplasia. In the 15.B congenic lines (B*2, B*5, B*12, B*13, B*15, B*19, and B*21) there were no significant differences in the incidence of viremia between B haplotypes. In fact, infection at hatch in all of the 15.B congenic lines induced tolerance to ALV-J because 100% of these chickens were viremic and transient circulating serum-neutralizing antibody was detected in only a few chickens throughout the 36 wk experiment. However, at 16 wk of age more B*15 chickens had antibody and fewer B*15 chickens shed virus than did the 16-wk-old B*2, B*5, or B*13 chickens. Moreover, compared with B*15 chickens, a higher percentage of B*13 chickens consistently shed virus from 8 wk postinfection to termination at 36 wk postinfection. The B haplotype had a transient effect on viral clearance in Line 0.B semicongenics, as more B*13 than B*21 chickens remained viremic through 5 wk of age. Very few (0%-18%) of the Line 0.B semicongenic chickens shed virus. By 36 wk of age, all Line 0 B*13 and B*21 chickens produced serum-neutralizing antibodies and cleared the virus. These results show that following ALV-J infection at hatch the immune response is influenced transiently by the B haplotype and strongly by the line of chicken. Although this study was not designed to study the effect of endogenous virus on ALV-J infection, the data suggest that endogenous virus expression reduced immunity to ALV-J in Line 15I5, compared with Line 0, a line known to lack endogenous virus genes.","['Mays, Jody K', 'Bacon, Larry D', 'Pandiri, Arun R', 'Fadly, Aly M']","['Mays JK', 'Bacon LD', 'Pandiri AR', 'Fadly AM']","['U.S. Department of Agriculture, Agricultural Research Service, Avian Disease and Oncology Laboratory, 3606 East Mount Hope Road, East Lansing, MI 48823, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,Avian Dis,Avian diseases,0370617,IM,"['Animals', 'Avian Leukosis/*genetics/immunology', 'Avian Leukosis Virus/*isolation & purification', 'Blood Grouping and Crossmatching/veterinary', 'Chickens/*genetics', 'Haplotypes/genetics', 'Hemagglutination Tests/veterinary', 'Major Histocompatibility Complex/genetics', 'Neutralization Tests/veterinary', 'Poultry Diseases/genetics/immunology/*virology', 'Viremia/veterinary', 'Virus Shedding/immunology']",2005/08/13 09:00,2005/10/06 09:00,['2005/08/13 09:00'],"['2005/08/13 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/10/06 09:00 [medline]', '2005/08/13 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Avian Dis. 2005 Jun;49(2):214-9. doi: 10.1637/7315-120104R.,,,,['10.1637/7315-120104R [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Our study also showed that LYL1 was highly expressed in most AML cell lines and in CD34+ AML cells. To determine whether LYL1 had an affect on the phenotype and behavior of myeloid cells, we introduced full-length LYL1 cDNA into K562 cells using electroporation and U937 cells with retroviral infection. Both of the derivative cell lines with overexpression of LYL1 had an increased growth rate and clonogenecity. Forced expression of LYL1 in K562 cells enhanced spontaneous and hemin-induced erythroid differentiation but blocked spontaneous as well as PMA-induced megakaryocytic differentiation. Overexpression of LYL1 in U937 cells blocked all-trans retinoic acid-induced monocytic differentiation. The LYL1-transfected U937 cells were also more resistant to the cytotoxic drug cytarabine.

CD4+ and CD8+ T cells from these patients demonstrated significantly increased sCD152 and cCD152 compared to normal donors. Furthermore, these patients had an increased proportion of the regulatory CD4(+)/CD25(+)/CD152+ subset that correlated with advanced Rai stage, unfavorable cytogenetics and low serum IgG and IgA levels.

Furthermore, it has not been possible to study leukemogenesis in vitro as normal human cells do not spontaneously transform. Thus, the nature and sequence of genetic changes required to convert human hematopoietic cells into leukemia cells have never been directly examined. We have developed a system where the first step in the leukemogenic process is an engineered disruption of differentiation and self-renewal due to expression of the TLS-ERG oncogene, followed in some cases by overexpression of hTERT. In two of 13 experiments, transduced cells underwent step-wise transformation and immortalization through spontaneous acquisition of additional changes. The acquired karyotypic abnormalities and alterations including upregulation of Bmi-1 and telomerase all occur in acute myeloid leukemia (AML), establishing the relevance of this system. One resultant cell line studied in depth exhibits cellular properties characteristic of AML, notably a hierarchical organization initiated by leukemic stem cells that differentiate abnormally. These findings provide direct evidence for multiple cooperating events in human leukemogenesis, and provide a foundation for studying the genetic changes that occur during leukemic initiation and progression.","['Warner, J K', 'Wang, J C Y', 'Takenaka, K', 'Doulatov, S', 'McKenzie, J L', 'Harrington, L', 'Dick, J E']","['Warner JK', 'Wang JC', 'Takenaka K', 'Doulatov S', 'McKenzie JL', 'Harrington L', 'Dick JE']","['Department of Molecular and Medical Genetics, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Blotting, Western', '*Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Lineage', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/*genetics', 'Cytogenetic Analysis', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/metabolism', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells', 'Hematopoietic System/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics', 'Myeloid Cells', 'Nuclear Proteins/metabolism', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/metabolism', 'Polycomb Repressive Complex 1', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/metabolism', 'RNA-Binding Protein FUS/metabolism', 'Repressor Proteins/metabolism', 'Retroviridae', 'Telomerase/metabolism', '*Transduction, Genetic']",2005/08/12 09:00,2005/11/05 09:00,['2005/08/12 09:00'],"['2005/08/12 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/11/05 09:00 [medline]', '2005/08/12 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2005 Oct;19(10):1794-805. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2403917.,,"['0 (BMI1 protein, human)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (RNA-Binding Protein FUS)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (TLS-ERG fusion protein, human)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Polycomb Repressive Complex 1)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (Telomerase)']",,"['2403917 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.leu.2403917 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Their dysregulation is also frequently associated with human malignancies. The Janus tyrosine kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription (JAK/STAT) pathway represents one such signalling cascade whose evolutionarily conserved roles include cell proliferation and haematopoiesis. Here we describe a systematic genome-wide survey for genes required for JAK/STAT pathway activity. Analysis of 20,026 RNA interference (RNAi)-induced phenotypes in cultured Drosophila melanogaster haemocyte-like cells identified interacting genes encoding 4 known and 86 previously uncharacterized proteins. Subsequently, cell-based epistasis experiments were used to classify these proteins on the basis of their interaction with known components of the signalling cascade. In addition to multiple human disease gene homologues, we have found the tyrosine phosphatase Ptp61F and the Drosophila homologue of BRWD3, a bromo-domain-containing protein disrupted in leukaemia. Moreover, in vivo analysis demonstrates that disrupted dBRWD3 and overexpressed Ptp61F function as suppressors of leukaemia-like blood cell tumours. This screen represents a comprehensive identification of novel loci required for JAK/STAT signalling and provides molecular insights into an important pathway relevant for human cancer.

Therefore, the telomeres of a karyotypically rather well characterized T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) cell line (CCRF-CEM) with several marker chromosomes were examined using peptide nucleic acid (PNA) telomere FISH probes to compare the telomere length of these markers with that of the chromosome arms of their origin. In addition, chromosome libraries, centromeric probes, and subtelomeric DNA probes were used to further define the marker chromosomes. Two markers could be newly defined and a concise karyotype of the cell line could be obtained by these detailed examinations: 42-47,X,-X,del(5) (q35?),t(5;15)(q14;q13.2),t(8;9)(p11;p24),del(9)(:p13-->qter)/inv(9)(pter-->p12:: q21-->p12::q21-->qter),+13,+20,+der(22)(p+ [HSR?])[cp]. The relative telomere length of all chromosomes showed considerable interchromosomal, intercellular, and inter-passage variation. However, it could be shown, that in four different passages of the examined cell line the observed differences between relative telomere lengths of the markers and the chromosomes of their origin, with two exceptions (short arms of del/inv9 and der22), were not significant. On the other hand, because of its mentioned variability, telomere length alone is not sufficient to reliably define the derivation of markers.","['Wick, U', 'Kirsch, M', 'Rauch, A', 'Chudoba, I', 'Lausen, B', 'Efferth, T', 'Gebhart, E']","['Wick U', 'Kirsch M', 'Rauch A', 'Chudoba I', 'Lausen B', 'Efferth T', 'Gebhart E']","['Institute of Human Genetics, University of Erlangen-Nurnberg, Erlangen, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Switzerland,Cytogenet Genome Res,Cytogenetic and genome research,101142708,IM,"['Cell Line, Tumor', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'Chromosome Mapping', 'Genetic Markers', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*genetics', 'Telomere/*genetics/ultrastructure']",2005/08/12 09:00,2005/12/13 09:00,['2005/08/12 09:00'],"['2004/09/02 00:00 [received]', '2004/10/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2005/08/12 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/12/13 09:00 [medline]', '2005/08/12 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cytogenet Genome Res. 2005;111(1):34-40. doi: 10.1159/000085667.,,['0 (Genetic Markers)'],,"['85667 [pii]', '10.1159/000085667 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Inhibition of Kit kinase activity resulted in a rapid dephosphorylation of Kit and inhibition of the downstream signaling pathways. Attenuation of Ras-Raf-Erk (phospho-Erk, phospho-p38), phosphatidyl inositol-3' kinase (phospho-p85, phospho-Akt, phospho-S6), and signal transducers and activators of transcription signaling pathways (phospho-STAT3/5/6) were measured by affinity liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry, by immunoblot, and by tissue microarrays of fixed cell pellets. To more globally define additional components of Kit signaling temporally altered by kinase inhibition, a novel multiplex quantitative isobaric peptide labeling approach was used. This approach allowed clustering of proteins by temporal expression patterns. Kit kinase, which dephosphorylates rapidly upon kinase inhibition, was shown to regulate both Shp-1 and BDP-1 tyrosine phosphatases and the phosphatase-interacting protein PSTPIP2. Interactions with SH2 domain adapters [growth factor receptor binding protein 2 (Grb2), Cbl, Slp-76] and SH3 domain adapters (HS1, cortactin, CD2BP3) were attenuated by inhibition of Kit kinase activity. Functional crosstalk between Kit and the non-receptor tyrosine kinases Fes/Fps, Fer, Btk, and Syk was observed.

Sequencing of the BCR-ABL gene in relapsed patients revealed a set of mutants that mediate drug resistance. Previously reported work postulated that the missense T315I mutation both alters the three-dimensional structure of the protein binding site, thus decreasing the protein sensitivity for the drug, and does not feature a fundamental hydrogen bond that is critical for binding with imatinib. These speculations, however, were not supported by investigations at the molecular modeling level. Here, we present the results obtained from the application of molecular dynamics simulations to the study of the interactions between T315I Bcr-Abl and imatinib. For the first time, we show that, with respect to the wild-type system, the absence of the supposedly critical H-bond is not the only cause for the failure of receptor inhibition by imatinib, but also a plethora of other protein/drug interactions are drastically and unfavorably changed in the mutant protein.","['Pricl, Sabrina', 'Fermeglia, Maurizio', 'Ferrone, Marco', 'Tamborini, Elena']","['Pricl S', 'Fermeglia M', 'Ferrone M', 'Tamborini E']","['Molecular Simulation Engineering Laboratory, Department of Chemical Engineering, University of Trieste, Piazzale Europa 1, 34127 Trieste, Italy. sabrina.pricl@dicamp.units.it']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Mol Cancer Ther,Molecular cancer therapeutics,101132535,IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Benzamides', 'Computational Biology', 'Computer Simulation', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*antagonists & inhibitors/chemistry/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Isoleucine/genetics', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*enzymology', 'Mutation, Missense', 'Piperazines/*pharmacology', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Pyrimidines/*pharmacology', 'Threonine/genetics']",2005/08/12 09:00,2005/11/15 09:00,['2005/08/12 09:00'],"['2005/08/12 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/11/15 09:00 [medline]', '2005/08/12 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Mol Cancer Ther. 2005 Aug;4(8):1167-74. doi: 10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-05-0101.,,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '04Y7590D77 (Isoleucine)', '2ZD004190S (Threonine)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",,"['4/8/1167 [pii]', '10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-05-0101 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A surrogate assay of susceptibility to radiation-induced acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) in the mouse based on chromosomal radiosensitivity has been developed and validated. This assay was applied to the mapping of radiation-induced AML risk modifier loci by association with microsatellite markers. A region on chromosome (chr) 18 with strong association is identified and confirmed by backcross analysis. Additional loci on chrs 8 and 13 show significant association. A key candidate gene Rbbp8 on chr18 is identified. Rbbp8 is shown to be upregulated in response to X-irradiation in the AML sensitive CBA strain but not AML resistant C57BL/6 strain.

Since Restin was localized in cell nucleus, and its homolog member, Necdin (neuronal growth suppressor factor), could interact with transcription factors p53 and E2F1, we proposed that Restin might also function as Necdin through interacting with some transcription factors. In this study, transcription factors p53, AP1, ATFs and E2Fs were cloned and used in the mammalian two-hybrid system to identify their interaction with Restin. The results showed that only ATF3 had a strong interaction with Restin. It is interesting to know that ATF3 was an important transcription factor for G1 cell cycle initiation in physiological stress response.

By fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH) on the corresponding metaphases with a bacterial artificial chromosome probe encompassing the janus kinase 2 (JAK2) gene at 9p24, we observed a split for both patients, suggesting that this gene was rearranged. The locus at 8p22 contains different candidate genes including the pericentriolar material 1 gene (PCM1), already implicated in reciprocal translocations. The rearrangement of the PCM1 gene was demonstrated by FISH, for both patients. By RT-PCR, we confirmed the fusion of 3' part of JAK2 with the 5' part of PCM1. Sequence analysis of the chimeric PCM1-JAK2 mRNA suggests that the putative protein displays the coiled-coil domains of PCM1 and the tyrosine kinase domain of JAK2.

Quantification of the cell turnover in closely related primate systems is particularly important for rare and aggressive forms of human cancers, such as adult T-cell leukemia. For this purpose, we have measured the death and proliferation rates of the CD4+ T lymphocyte population in squirrel monkeys (Saimiri sciureus) infected by human T-lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-1). The kinetics of in vivo bromodeoxyuridine labeling revealed no modulation of the cell turnover in HTLV-1-infected monkeys with normal CD4 cell counts. In contrast, a substantial decrease in the proliferation rate of the CD4+ T population was observed in lymphocytic monkeys (e.g. characterized by excessive proportions of CD4+ T lymphocytes and by the presence of abnormal flower-like cells). Unexpectedly, onset of HTLV-associated leukemia thus occurs in the absence of increased CD4+ T-cell proliferation.

BCL11 proteins are related C2H2 zinc-finger transcription factors that act as transcriptional repressors. Here, we demonstrate the association of the endogenous BCL11B with the nucleosome remodeling and histone deacetylase (NuRD) complex, one of the major transcriptional corepressor complexes in mammalian cells. BCL11B complexes from T lymphocytes possess trichostatin A-sensitive histone deacetylase activity, confirming the functionality of the complexes. Analysis of the BCL11B-NuRD association demonstrated that BCL11B directly interacted with the metastasis-associated proteins MTA1 and MTA2 through the amino-terminal region. We provide evidence for the functional requirement of MTA1 in transcriptional repression mediated by BCL11B through the following: (1) overexpression of MTA1 enhanced the transcriptional repression mediated by BCL11B, (2) knockdown of MTA1 expression by small interfering RNA inhibited BCL11B transcriptional repression activity and (3) MTA1 was specifically recruited to a BCL11B targeted promoter.

Melphalan is widely used to treat patients with MM but as yet its mechanisms of action are poorly documented. In the current study, we demonstrate that melphalan induces a drastic downregulation of Mcl-1L, Bcl-x(L) and BimEL in human melphalan-sensitive myeloma cells while the most potent proapoptotic isoforms, BimL and S, are affected to a lesser extent. Moreover, Mcl-1L and BimEL disappearance is associated with the generation of proapoptotic cleaved forms generated by a caspase cleavage. In myeloma cells, we have previously shown that Mcl-1 neutralizes the proapoptotic function of Bim and therefore, prevents the activation of death effectors. In this study, we demonstrate that melphalan disrupts the Mcl-1/Bim complex whereas the Bcl-2/Bim complex is not modified. The disappearance of full length Mcl-1 allows the release of Bim isoforms, particularly L and S, which can exert their proapoptotic function and leads to Bax activation and cytochrome c release. Thus, we can hypothesize that the cleaved 26 kDa proapoptotic Mcl-1 and the 19 and 12 kDa of Bim, generated during melphalan treatment could contribute to the amplification loop of apoptosis.","['Gomez-Bougie, Patricia', 'Oliver, Lisa', 'Le Gouill, Steven', 'Bataille, Regis', 'Amiot, Martine']","['Gomez-Bougie P', 'Oliver L', 'Le Gouill S', 'Bataille R', 'Amiot M']","['Departement de recherche en cancerologie, Equipe 5 labelisee L N C 2005, Institut de biologie, 9 quai Moncousu, 44093 Nantes cedex 01, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Bcl-2-Like Protein 11', 'Down-Regulation', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Melphalan/*pharmacology', 'Membrane Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Multiple Myeloma/*drug therapy', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*metabolism', 'Protein Isoforms/genetics/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2005/08/11 09:00,2005/12/24 09:00,['2005/08/11 09:00'],"['2005/08/11 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/12/24 09:00 [medline]', '2005/08/11 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2005 Dec 1;24(54):8076-9. doi: 10.1038/sj.onc.1208949.,,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (BCL2L11 protein, human)', '0 (Bcl-2-Like Protein 11)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Protein Isoforms)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', 'Q41OR9510P (Melphalan)']",,"['1208949 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.onc.1208949 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The suppression of mFLT3Asp838Val activation and signaling by these substitutions was partially recovered by shifting the culture temperature from 37 to 33 degrees C, or by the introduction of Cdc37 and Hsp90. Taken together, Tyr845, Tyr892 and Tyr922 are the critical residues in mFLT3Asp838Val activation, possibly through stabilizing the active conformation of mFLT3Asp838Val.","['Ishiko, Jun', 'Mizuki, Masao', 'Matsumura, Itaru', 'Shibayama, Hirohiko', 'Sugahara, Hiroyuki', 'Scholz, Glen', 'Serve, Hubert', 'Kanakura, Yuzuru']","['Ishiko J', 'Mizuki M', 'Matsumura I', 'Shibayama H', 'Sugahara H', 'Scholz G', 'Serve H', 'Kanakura Y']","['Department of Hematology and Oncology, Osaka University Graduate School of Medicine, 2-2 Yamada-oka, Suita, Osaka 565-0871, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,IM,"['*Amino Acid Substitution', 'Animals', 'Cell Division', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Survival', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Kidney', 'Mice', 'Phenylalanine', 'Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide', 'Recombinant Proteins/metabolism', 'Transfection', '*Tyrosine', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/*genetics/*metabolism']",2005/08/11 09:00,2006/03/28 09:00,['2005/08/11 09:00'],"['2005/08/11 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/03/28 09:00 [medline]', '2005/08/11 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2005 Dec 8;24(55):8144-53. doi: 10.1038/sj.onc.1208957.,,"['0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '42HK56048U (Tyrosine)', '47E5O17Y3R (Phenylalanine)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Flt3 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)']",,"['1208957 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.onc.1208957 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Chimeric and humanized antibodies have demonstrated activity against a variety of tumors. Although the humanized anti-CD33 antibody HuM195 has only modest activity against overt acute myeloid leukemia (AML), it can eliminate minimal residual disease in acute promyelocytic leukemia. High-dose radioimmunotherapy with b-particle-emitting isotopes targeting CD33, CD45, and CD66 can potentially allow intensification of antileukemic therapy before hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Conversely, a-particle immunotherapy with isotopes such as bismuth-213 or actinium-225 offers the possibility of selective tumor cell kill while sparing surrounding normal tissues. Targeted chemotherapy with the anti-CD33- calicheamicin construct gemtuzumab ozogamicin has produced remissions in relapsed AML and appears promising when used in combination with standard chemotherapy for newly diagnosed AML.

In 1990, available therapy produced complete responses in less than 5% of treated patients. This is in marked contrast to modern regimens, which can reliably produce complete responses in over 50% of patients. This remarkable improvement is completely attributable to the introduction of new active agents. These new agents include three purine analogues (pentostatin, fludarabine, and cladribine) and two monoclonal antibodies (rituximab and alemtuzumab). Novel combinations of these agents have emerged as effective new therapies for previously untreated and pretreated patients. Clinical studies indicate that such combinations can induce higher response rates--including complete responses--than single-agent therapy. Those patients who achieve a complete response have superior survival, compared with those who only achieve a partial response.

METHODS: 369 documented cases of B-NHL were further subtyped according to the 2001 WHO classification of lymphoid neoplasms, on the basis of hematoxylin and eosin staining, immunohistochemistry and in-situ hybridization techniques. RESULTS: Amongst the 369 cases of B-NHL studied, 353 cases could be further classified into 11 subtypes. Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, extranodal marginal zone lymphoma and follicular lymphoma were the commonest subtypes, accounting for 51.2% (189 cases), 14.9% (55 cases) and 10.6% (39 cases) of all cases respectively. Tumors in lymph nodes were seen in 158 cases (42.8%) and in extra node in 211 cases (57.2%). B-cell prolymphocytic leukemia and hairy cell leukemia were not identified. When comparing the diagnosis based on morphologic examination alone with the diagnosis based on both morphology and immunophenotype, there was a 80% concordance rate. Immunohistochemical study was helpful in reaching the correct diagnosis in many cases and could improve the overall diagnostic accuracy by about 20%. CONCLUSIONS: Amongst cases of B-NHL, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma is the commonest subtype, followed by MALToma and follicular lymphoma. While morphologic examination forms the basis for lymphoma diagnosis, immunohistochemical study also plays an important role in further subtyping. A combination of both modalities are sufficient for arriving at an accurate diagnosis in most cases of B-NHL, in keeping with the recommendation of the 2001 WHO classification of lymphoid neoplasms.","['Zhang, Yan-ning', 'Zhou, Xiao-ge', 'Zhang, Shu-hong', 'Wang, Peng', 'Zhang, Chang-huai', 'Huang, Shou-fang']","['Zhang YN', 'Zhou XG', 'Zhang SH', 'Wang P', 'Zhang CH', 'Huang SF']","['Department of Pathology, Beijing Friendship Hospital, Capital University of Medical Sciences, Beijing 100050, China. yanningzhang99@yahoo.com']",['chi'],['Journal Article'],China,Zhonghua Bing Li Xue Za Zhi,Zhonghua bing li xue za zhi = Chinese journal of pathology,0005331,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antigens, CD20/metabolism', 'CD79 Antigens/metabolism', 'Child', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Leukosialin/metabolism', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/immunology/*pathology', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell, Marginal Zone/immunology/*pathology', 'Lymphoma, Follicular/immunology/*pathology', 'Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse/immunology/*pathology', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/*classification/immunology/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'World Health Organization']",2005/08/11 09:00,2007/04/25 09:00,['2005/08/11 09:00'],"['2005/08/11 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/04/25 09:00 [medline]', '2005/08/11 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Zhonghua Bing Li Xue Za Zhi. 2005 Apr;34(4):193-7.,,"['0 (Antigens, CD20)', '0 (CD79 Antigens)', '0 (Leukosialin)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: We evaluated MSG sequential biopsies during cGVHD therapy in 14 allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (BMT) patients. Nine patients that did not develop GVHD after BMT entered the control group. Biopsies were examined using hematoxylin-eosin, Periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) and leukocyte common antigen staining. RESULTS: A significant loss of PAS+ acinar volume was observed at the diagnosis of cGVHD as much as at the end of treatment when compared with the control group.

Although the development of genetic aberrations is random, those conferring survival advantages are selected for in a Darwinian manner, thus allowing continuous adaptation to selection pressures. Chromosomal aberrations are a prominent manifestation of genetic damage, which can be closely linked with tumor behavior and outcome as exemplified by curative treatment of chronic myelogenous leukemia resulting from targeting the BCR-ABL translocation. In the case of head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCC), chromosomal changes are detectable at all stages of tumor development, providing excellent opportunities for genomic prognostication and therapy. Several studies have shown that the overall genomic profile of HNSCC is highly consistent, but individual tumors vary significantly in their complement of genetic alterations, thereby confounding clinical correlation. The application of modern genetic and bioinformatic analytic approaches has facilitated the identification of critical genomic changes in HNSCC, many of which have been linked to clinical outcome. These genetic aberrations represent excellent targets for novel therapeutics, but require validation. The initiation of phase III trials evaluating the therapeutic utility of genetic aberrations suggests a promising future for genome-based treatment of HNSCC.","['Wreesmann, V B', 'Singh, B']","['Wreesmann VB', 'Singh B']","['Department of Surgery, Laboratory of Epithelial Cancer Biology and Head and Neck Service, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, 1275 York Avenue, New York, NY 10021, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",Denmark,J Oral Pathol Med,Journal of oral pathology & medicine : official publication of the International Association of Oral Pathologists and the American Academy of Oral Pathology,8911934,IM,"['Carcinoma, Squamous Cell/*genetics', '*Chromosome Aberrations', 'Gene Targeting', 'Genetic Heterogeneity', 'Genetic Testing/methods', 'Genetic Therapy', 'Head and Neck Neoplasms/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Loss of Heterozygosity/genetics', 'Prognosis']",2005/08/11 09:00,2005/09/13 09:00,['2005/08/11 09:00'],"['2005/08/11 09:00 [pubmed]', '2005/09/13 09:00 [medline]', '2005/08/11 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Oral Pathol Med. 2005 Sep;34(8):449-59. doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0714.2005.00343.x.,,,125,"['JOP343 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1600-0714.2005.00343.x [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Only few and controversial data are available on a potential, similar role for beer, which represents a more cost-effective, safe, and widely available beverage. Starting from the evidence that many antioxidant compounds present in red wine are also present at similar or even higher concentrations in beers, we first screened 48 commercially available beers and selected one (Mrt-HP) with very high polyphenol concentration and antioxidant activity estimated by ferric reducing antioxidant power. We demonstrated that a lyophilized preparation of Mrt-HP beer was cytotoxic with respect to a beer with low polyphenolic content (Trt-LP) when assayed on HL-60 human leukemia cell line. We measured a 60% decrease in cell viability at a polyphenol concentration of 250 microM quercetin equivalents. We also demonstrated that Mrt-HP cytotoxicity was not an artifact due to cell growth conditions because addition of Mrt-HP extracts to cell medium generated peroxide levels indistinguishable from controls. By means of cytofluorimetric analysis of pre-G1 population and caspase 3 activation, we demonstrated that Mrt-HP extracts activated apoptosis in HL-60 cell line. Finally, we found that the concentration of quercetin, resveratrol, and gallic acid in Mrt-HP was 10, 4.6, and 4.6-fold higher, respectively, than in Trt-LP, suggesting that the presence of these molecules might be responsible for the observed cytotoxicity. These data, together with the low in vivo beer toxicity reported in the literature, suggest a possible chemopreventive role for this beverage that requires further studies in animal models.","['Tedesco, Idolo', 'Nappo, Annunziata', 'Petitto, Fabio', 'Iacomino, Giuseppe', 'Nazzaro, Filomena', 'Palumbo, Rosanna', 'Russo, Gian Luigi']","['Tedesco I', 'Nappo A', 'Petitto F', 'Iacomino G', 'Nazzaro F', 'Palumbo R', 'Russo GL']","[""Istituto di Scienze dell'Alimentazione, Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche, Avellino, Italy.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Nutr Cancer,Nutrition and cancer,7905040,IM,"['Anticarcinogenic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Antioxidants/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', '*Beer', 'Caspase 3', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Cell Division/*drug effects', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid/methods', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Flavonoids/analysis/*pharmacology', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Freeze Drying', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'L-Lactate Dehydrogenase/metabolism', 'Lipid Peroxidation/*drug effects', 'Oxidation-Reduction', 'Phenols/analysis/*pharmacology', 'Polyphenols']",2005/08/11 09:00,2006/03/07 09:00,['2005/08/11 09:00'],"['2005/08/11 09:00 [pubmed]', '2006/03/07 09:00 [medline]', '2005/08/11 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Nutr Cancer. 2005;52(1):74-83. doi: 10.1207/s15327914nc5201_10.,,"['0 (Anticarcinogenic Agents)', '0 (Antioxidants)', '0 (Flavonoids)', '0 (Phenols)', '0 (Polyphenols)', 'EC 1.1.1.27 (L-Lactate Dehydrogenase)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",,['10.1207/s15327914nc5201_10 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

There were no significant differences in the growth of the non-differentiated and differentiated cells in complete serum-containing media.

We found that both the mRNA and protein levels of Daxx markedly increased when cells underwent apoptosis after H2O2 treatment. Pretreatment with the cell-permeable antioxidant, N-acetyl cysteine, prevented cells from H2O2-induced Daxx upregulation and subsequent apoptosis, indicating that the endogenous oxidant regulated Daxx expression.

METHODS: A total of 164 patients with follicular lymphoma (grade 1/2), mantle cell lymphoma or lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma (immunocytoma) was randomised to treatment with vincristine 2 mg (day 1) and prednisone 100 mg/m2 (days 1-5) + bendamustine 60 mg/m2 (days 1-5) or + cyclophosphamide 400 mg/m2 (days 1-5) for a total of eight 21-day cycles. RESULTS: The rate of complete remission was 22% with BOP and 20% with COP. The projected 5-year survival rate was 61% with BOP and 46% with COP. The BOP-associated 5-year survival advantage almost reached significance in the subgroup of patients who responded to therapy (74% vs. 56%; P = 0.05), and did reach significance in responders who did not receive interferon maintenance therapy (70% vs. 47%; P = 0.03). Toxicity was acceptable in both treatment groups, although alopecia and leucopenia were more severe with COP.
