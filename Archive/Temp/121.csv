This compound unexpectedly cleaves supercoiled double-stranded DNA stoichiometrically and oxidatively, in a non-specific manner without any external reductant added, under physiological conditions. Spectro-electrochemical investigations of PtL-Cl were carried out in comparison with the analogue CuL-Cl as a reference compound. The results support a phenolate oxidation, generating a phenoxyl radical responsible for the ligand-based DNA cleavage property of the title compounds. Time-dependent in vitro cytotoxicity assays were performed with both PtL-Cl and CuL-Cl in various cancer cell lines. The compound CuL-Cl overcomes cisplatin-resistance in ovarian carcinoma and mouse leukaemia cell lines, with additional activity in some other cells. The platinum analogue, PtL-Cl also inhibits cell-proliferation selectively. Additionally, cellular-uptake studies performed for both compounds in ovarian carcinoma cell lines showed that significant amounts of Pt and Cu were accumulated in the A2780 and A2780R cancer cells. The conformational and structural changes induced by PtL-Cl and CuL-Cl on calf thymus DNA and phiX174 supercoiled phage DNA at ambient conditions were followed by electrophoretic mobility assay and circular dichroism spectroscopy. The compounds induce extensive DNA degradation and unwinding, along with formation of a monoadduct at the DNA minor groove. Thus, hybrid effects of metal-centre variation, multiple DNA-binding modes and ligand-based redox activity towards cancer cell-growth inhibition have been demonstrated. Finally, reactions of PtL-Cl with DNA model bases (9-Ethylguanine and 5'-GMP) followed by NMR and MS showed slow binding at Guanine-N7 and for the double stranded self complimentary oligonucleotide d(GTCGAC)(2) in the minor groove.","['Roy, Sudeshna', 'Maheswari, Palanisamy Uma', 'Lutz, Martin', 'Spek, Anthony L', 'den Dulk, Hans', 'Barends, Sharief', 'van Wezel, Gilles P', 'Hartl, Frantisek', 'Reedijk, Jan']","['Roy S', 'Maheswari PU', 'Lutz M', 'Spek AL', 'den Dulk H', 'Barends S', 'van Wezel GP', 'Hartl F', 'Reedijk J']","['Leiden Institute of Chemistry, Gorlaeus Laboratories, Leiden University, P.O.

This microfluidic method is rapid by detecting the early event of cytotoxicity of drug candidates on cancer cells, without waiting for a couple of days needed for cell seeding and drug treatment by conventional assays. The miniaturized biochip consists of a V-shaped structure for the single-cell selection and retention. Various test reagents such as the chemotherapy drug (daunorubicin), an ionophore (ionomycin), and herbal ingredients from licorice (isoliquiritigenin or IQ) were investigated for their abilities to stimulate sustained cellular [Ca(2+)](i) elevations. The microfluidic results obtained in hours have been confirmed by conventional cytotoxicity assays which take days to complete. Moreover, any color or chemical interference problems found in the conventional assays of herbal compounds could be resolved. Using the microfluidic approach, IQ (50 microM) has been found to cause a sustained [Ca(2+)](i) elevation and cytotoxic effects on leukemia cells. The microfluidic single-cell analysis not only reduces reagent cost, and demands less cells, but also reveals some phenomena due to cellular heterogeneity that cannot be observed in bulk analysis.","['Li, XiuJun', 'Xue, Xiaoyan', 'Li, Paul C H']","['Li X', 'Xue X', 'Li PC']","['Department of Chemistry, Simon Fraser University, Burnaby, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20081112,England,Integr Biol (Camb),Integrative biology : quantitative biosciences from nano to macro,101478378,,IM,"['Animals', 'Biological Assay/*instrumentation', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Computer Systems', 'Equipment Design', 'Equipment Failure Analysis', 'Flow Cytometry/*instrumentation', 'Macrophages/*drug effects/*physiology', 'Mice', 'Microfluidic Analytical Techniques/*instrumentation', 'Plants, Medicinal/*toxicity', 'Toxicity Tests/*instrumentation']",2009/12/22 06:00,2010/03/11 06:00,['2009/12/22 06:00'],"['2009/12/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/12/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/03/11 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1039/b812987h [doi]'],ppublish,Integr Biol (Camb). 2009 Jan;1(1):90-8. doi: 10.1039/b812987h.

We found that OGG1 expression was significantly downregulated by the RUNX1-ETO fusion protein product of the t(8;21) chromosome translocation in normal haematopoietic progenitor cells and in patients with acute myeloid leukaemia (AML). Further examination of OGG1 expression in 174 AML trial patients using Affymetrix microarrays showed that the prevalence rate of OGG1 expression was 33% and correlated strongly with adverse cytogenetics. OGG1-expressing patients had a worse relapse-free survival and overall survival and an increased risk of relapse at 5-years of follow-up. There remained a trend towards increased relapse rate among OGG1-expressing patients, even after adjusting for other known risk factors in comprehensive stratified analyses. We also determined a trend for OGG1 expression to have a more adverse impact on disease outcome in the context of the FLT3-ITD mutation. This study highlights OGG1 as a valuable prognostic marker that could be used to sub-stratify AML patients to predict those likely to fail conventional chemotherapies but those likely to benefit from novel therapeutic approaches that modulate DNA repair activity.","['Liddiard, K', 'Hills, R', 'Burnett, A K', 'Darley, R L', 'Tonks, A']","['Liddiard K', 'Hills R', 'Burnett AK', 'Darley RL', 'Tonks A']","['Department of Haematology, School of Medicine, Cardiff University, Cardiff, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20091221,England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '5614-64-2 (8-hydroxyguanine)', '5Z93L87A1R (Guanine)', 'EC 3.2.2.- (DNA Glycosylases)', 'EC 3.2.2.- (oxoguanine glycosylase 1, human)']",IM,"['Biomarkers, Tumor/genetics/*metabolism', 'DNA Glycosylases/genetics/*metabolism', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Guanine/*analogs & derivatives/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*diagnosis/enzymology/metabolism', 'Mutation', '*Prognosis']",2009/12/22 06:00,2010/04/24 06:00,['2009/12/22 06:00'],"['2009/12/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/12/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/04/24 06:00 [medline]']","['onc2009462 [pii]', '10.1038/onc.2009.462 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2010 Apr 1;29(13):2005-12. doi: 10.1038/onc.2009.462.

HTLV-1-infected T lymphocytes form 'virological synapses', but the mechanism of HTLV-1 transmission remains poorly understood. We show here that HTLV-1-infected T lymphocytes transiently store viral particles as carbohydrate-rich extracellular assemblies that are held together and attached to the cell surface by virally-induced extracellular matrix components, including collagen and agrin, and cellular linker proteins, such as tetherin and galectin-3. Extracellular viral assemblies rapidly adhere to other cells upon cell contact, allowing virus spread and infection of target cells. Their removal strongly reduces the ability of HTLV-1-producing cells to infect target cells. Our findings unveil a novel virus transmission mechanism based on the generation of extracellular viral particle assemblies whose structure, composition and function resemble those of bacterial biofilms. HTLV-1 biofilm-like structures represent a major route for virus transmission from cell to cell.","['Pais-Correia, Ana-Monica', 'Sachse, Martin', 'Guadagnini, Stephanie', 'Robbiati, Valentina', 'Lasserre, Remi', 'Gessain, Antoine', 'Gout, Olivier', 'Alcover, Andres', 'Thoulouze, Maria-Isabel']","['Pais-Correia AM', 'Sachse M', 'Guadagnini S', 'Robbiati V', 'Lasserre R', 'Gessain A', 'Gout O', 'Alcover A', 'Thoulouze MI']","['Institut Pasteur, Unite de Biologie Cellulaire des Lymphocytes, Centre National de Recherche Scientifique (CNRS), Unite de Recherche Associee 1961, Paris, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20091220,United States,Nat Med,Nature medicine,9502015,"['0 (Gene Products, env)', '11028-71-0 (Concanavalin A)']",IM,"['Biofilms', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/*virology', 'Concanavalin A', 'Extracellular Matrix/*virology', 'Gene Products, env/metabolism', 'HTLV-I Infections/*transmission/virology', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/pathogenicity/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Microscopy, Electron, Transmission', 'Virus Assembly/physiology', 'Virus Attachment', 'Virus Internalization']",2009/12/22 06:00,2010/01/26 06:00,['2009/12/22 06:00'],"['2009/08/03 00:00 [received]', '2009/10/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/12/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/12/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/01/26 06:00 [medline]']","['nm.2065 [pii]', '10.1038/nm.2065 [doi]']",ppublish,Nat Med. 2010 Jan;16(1):83-9. doi: 10.1038/nm.2065.

B- and mantle-cell lymphomas, chronic myeloid leukaemia, and multiple myeloma, however, express abnormally high levels of MCL1, contributing to chemoresistance and disease relapse. The mechanism of MCL1 overexpression in cancer is not well understood. Here we show that the deubiquitinase USP9X stabilizes MCL1 and thereby promotes cell survival. USP9X binds MCL1 and removes the Lys 48-linked polyubiquitin chains that normally mark MCL1 for proteasomal degradation. Increased USP9X expression correlates with increased MCL1 protein in human follicular lymphomas and diffuse large B-cell lymphomas. Moreover, patients with multiple myeloma overexpressing USP9X have a poor prognosis. Knockdown of USP9X increases MCL1 polyubiquitination, which enhances MCL1 turnover and cell killing by the BH3 mimetic ABT-737. These results identify USP9X as a prognostic and therapeutic target, and they show that deubiquitinases may stabilize labile oncoproteins in human malignancies.","['Schwickart, Martin', 'Huang, Xiaodong', 'Lill, Jennie R', 'Liu, Jinfeng', 'Ferrando, Ronald', 'French, Dorothy M', 'Maecker, Heather', ""O'Rourke, Karen"", 'Bazan, Fernando', 'Eastham-Anderson, Jeffrey', 'Yue, Peng', 'Dornan, David', 'Huang, David C S', 'Dixit, Vishva M']","['Schwickart M', 'Huang X', 'Lill JR', 'Liu J', 'Ferrando R', 'French DM', 'Maecker H', ""O'Rourke K"", 'Bazan F', 'Eastham-Anderson J', 'Yue P', 'Dornan D', 'Huang DC', 'Dixit VM']","['Department of Physiological Chemistry, Genentech, Inc., 1 DNA Way, South San Francisco, California 94080, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20091220,England,Nature,Nature,0410462,"['0 (ABT-737)', '0 (Biphenyl Compounds)', '0 (Mcl1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Nitrophenols)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Sulfonamides)', '0 (Taxoids)', '0 (USP9X protein, human)', '120904-94-1 (Polyubiquitin)', '15H5577CQD (Docetaxel)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', 'EC 3.4.19.12 (Ubiquitin Thiolesterase)', 'K3Z4F929H6 (Lysine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Biphenyl Compounds/pharmacology', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival', 'DNA Damage', 'Docetaxel', 'Etoposide/pharmacology', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Gene Knockdown Techniques', 'Half-Life', 'Humans', 'Lysine/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, SCID', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Neoplasms/diagnosis/*metabolism/*pathology', 'Nitrophenols/pharmacology', 'Phosphorylation/radiation effects', 'Piperazines/pharmacology', 'Polyubiquitin/*metabolism', 'Prognosis', 'Protein Binding/radiation effects', 'Protein Stability', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/genetics/*metabolism', 'RNA Interference', 'Sulfonamides/pharmacology', 'Taxoids/pharmacology', 'Ubiquitin Thiolesterase/deficiency/genetics/*metabolism', 'Ubiquitination', 'Ultraviolet Rays', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",2009/12/22 06:00,2010/02/13 06:00,['2009/12/22 06:00'],"['2008/12/17 00:00 [received]', '2009/11/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/12/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/12/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/02/13 06:00 [medline]']","['nature08646 [pii]', '10.1038/nature08646 [doi]']",ppublish,Nature. 2010 Jan 7;463(7277):103-7. doi: 10.1038/nature08646.

However, t-ALL cases without 11q23 abnormality have been rarely described. We describe 6 adults with secondary t-ALL without 11q23 abnormalities following various treatment regimens for primary malignancies. We also reviewed 48 t-ALL cases, with complete chromosomal karyotyping, reported in the literature from 1992 to 2007. In the 48 cases, an 11q23 abnormality involving the MLL gene locus was the predominant chromosomal aberration (32 [67%]), followed by t(9;22) (6 [13%]) and a normal karyotype (4 [8%]).

MATERIALS AND METHODS: In the present work, the interactions of seven commercially available phenothiazine derivatives, known P-glycoprotein inhibitors, with this transporter and MRP1 were compared. By flow cytometry, it was shown that all the drugs increased the accumulation of rhodamine 123 in the P-gp-overexpressing lymphoma cell line L5178 MDR. On the other hand, phenothiazine derivatives stimulated MRP1-mediated efflux of fluorescent probe (BCPCF) out of human erythrocytes. RESULTS: In this way, these phenothiazine derivatives were identified as a group of atypical MDR modulators that differently interact with P-gp (as inhibitors) and MRP1 (as stimulators).

We found that Ext1(-/-) ESCs retained their self-renewal potential but failed to transit from self-renewal to differentiation upon removal of leukemia inhibitory factor.

Thus, blockage of NF-kappaB activity may improve the anti-cancer activity of TNF-alpha. HA14-1 induces apoptosis in various human cancer cells, and the molecular mechanisms of this action remain to be fully characterized. The present study evaluated the involvement of NF-kappaB, reactive oxygen species (ROS), and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) in the effects of HA14-1 by examining the sensitization effect on TNF-alpha-induced apoptosis in human leukemia cells. Such sensitization is closely associated with the inhibitory effect of HA14-1 on TNF-alpha-mediated NF-kappaB activation. HA14-1 suppressed NF-kappaB activation through inhibition of phosphorylation and degradation of IkappaBalpha. This inhibition was correlated with suppression of NF-kappaB-dependent gene products (c-myc, cyclin D1, cox-2, and IAP-1). Additionally, the present findings provide evidence of a critical role of ROS accumulation induced by HA14-1 in TNF-alpha-induced apoptosis. Moreover, HA14-1 also markedly sustained TNF-alpha-mediated JNK activation. A specific JNK inhibitor abolished the sensitization effect of HA14-1 on TNF-alpha-induced apoptosis. Taken together, these results indicate that ROS and JNK represent important signals in HA14-1 sensitization in TNF-alpha-induced apoptosis.","['Moon, Dong-Oh', 'Kim, Mun-Ock', 'Kang, Sang-Hyuck', 'Choi, Yung Hyun', 'Park, Sung Yong', 'Kim, Gi-Young']","['Moon DO', 'Kim MO', 'Kang SH', 'Choi YH', 'Park SY', 'Kim GY']","['Laboratory of Immunobiology, Department of Marine Life Sciences, Jeju National University, Jeju, Republic of Korea.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20091222,Ireland,Cancer Lett,Cancer letters,7600053,"['0 (Benzopyrans)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Nitriles)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '0 (ethyl', '2-amino-6-bromo-4-(1-cyano-2-ethoxy-2-oxoethyl)-4H-chromene-3-carboxylate)', 'EC 2.7.12.2 (MAP Kinase Kinase 4)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Benzopyrans/*pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'DNA, Neoplasm/metabolism', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*metabolism/*pathology', 'MAP Kinase Kinase 4/*metabolism', 'NF-kappa B/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Nitriles/*pharmacology', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/*pharmacology']",2009/12/22 06:00,2010/04/22 06:00,['2009/12/22 06:00'],"['2009/06/30 00:00 [received]', '2009/09/22 00:00 [revised]', '2009/11/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/12/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/12/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/04/22 06:00 [medline]']","['S0304-3835(09)00684-3 [pii]', '10.1016/j.canlet.2009.11.014 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Lett. 2010 Jun 1;292(1):111-8. doi: 10.1016/j.canlet.2009.11.014.

DESIGN: Otologic complaints and histologic findings were evaluated in 25 temporal bones of 13 acute lymphocytic leukemia patients. RESULTS: Nine patients had a history of otologic complaints, including hearing loss, otalgia, otorrhea, and vertigo in 5, 3, 3, and 2 patients, respectively. Hemorrhage was most commonly observed in the middle ear (6 patients, 9 temporal bones) and was also observed in cochlea (4 patients, 4 temporal bones), and vestibule (6 patients, 6 temporal bones). Leukemic infiltration was observed in the petrous apex (13 patients, 24 temporal bones), middle ear (7 patients, 14 temporal bones), cochlea (3 patients, 4 temporal bones), vestibule (3 patients, 4 temporal bones), and internal auditory canal (5 patients, 8 temporal bones). Inflammatory changes were observed in the cochlea (5 patients, 8 temporal bones) and vestibule (5 patients, 8 temporal bones). Middle ear effusion containing floating tumor cells was observed in 4 temporal bones of 3 patients. Irreversible histopathologic changes of the middle ear, such as the destruction of the ossicles, perforation of the tympanic membrane, and granulation tissues were observed in 5 temporal bones of 4 patients.

Experimental investigation showed that the novel NIR-Nps have negligible background fluorescence and low inner filtration interference in complex biologic systems such as whole blood. The specific recognition characteristic of aptamer in whole blood samples was investigated by using the proposed fluorescence anisotropy method. The results showed that the fluorescent nanoparticle-tagged aptamer probes sequence could achieve specific recognition of the target cancer cells from complex mixtures including whole blood samples. And the reaction conditions for the binding between fluorescent nanoparticle-conjugated aptamer probes and target cancer cells were optimized. The present approach can exhibit sensitive and reproducible fluorescence anisotropy responses to the target cells concentration and the calibration curve showed good linearity when the target cells concentration is in the range from 4.0 x 10(3) to 7.0 x 10(5)cells/mL.

Twenty-four prepubertal gilts received 750 IU of pregnant mare serum gonadotropin (PMSG) and 500 IU of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) 72h later. Gilts in the control group (n=23) were observed daily for estrus behavior. Endometrial tissue samples, conceptuses, blood serum, and uterine luminal flushings (ULFs) were collected on days 10, 11, 12, and 15 after insemination. There was no effect of estrus induction on estradiol content in ULFs, or on ovulation and fertilization rates in studied gilts. However, the content of progesterone in the blood serum was greater in naturally ovulated gilts in comparison to gonadotropin-treated animals on day 12 of pregnancy (P<0.05). HoxA10 expression was up-regulated in the endometrium of pregnant gilts, with natural ovulation on days 12 (P<0.05) and 15 (P<0.001) in comparison to days 10 and 11. When compared to control gilts, administration of PMSG/hCG resulted in decreased expression of endometrial HoxA10, TGFbeta, LIF, and PGHS-2 on day 12 of pregnancy (P<0.05).

Art v 1, the major mugwort pollen allergen appears as two-domain glycoprotein, consisting of an N-terminal defensin-like and a proline/hydroxyproline-rich C-terminal part. Patients sensitized to Art v 1 commonly display IgE antibodies against the cysteine-stabilized defensin fold. Site-directed mutagenesis of eight cysteines was used to disrupt disulfide bonds to generate molecules with altered IgE-binding capacity. Engineered constructs were expressed in E. coli and recombinant proteins were tested for their allergenic and T cell reactivity as well as for their physicochemical characteristics. Three cysteine variants (C22S, C47S, and C49S) exhibited extremely low IgE-binding activity in immunoblot and ELISA using sera from Art v 1-allergic patients. Mediator release assays using rat basophil leukemia cells showed that these variants displayed a 1x10(5)-fold reduced allergenic potency as compared to wild-type protein. All variants were able to activate allergen-specific T cells in PBMC, as well as Art v 1-specific T cell lines and clones. Variant C49S displayed an increased hydrophobic surface potential which correlated with an advanced activation of allergen-specific T cells. The low allergenicity and high immunogenic activity of Art v 1 variant C49S renders the molecule an attractive candidate for hypoallergen-based immunotherapy of Artemisia pollen allergy.","['Gadermaier, Gabriele', 'Jahn-Schmid, Beatrice', 'Vogel, Lothar', 'Egger, Matthias', 'Himly, Martin', 'Briza, Peter', 'Ebner, Christof', 'Vieths, Stefan', 'Bohle, Barbara', 'Ferreira, Fatima']","['Gadermaier G', 'Jahn-Schmid B', 'Vogel L', 'Egger M', 'Himly M', 'Briza P', 'Ebner C', 'Vieths S', 'Bohle B', 'Ferreira F']","['Christian Doppler Laboratory for Allergy Diagnosis and Therapy, Department of Molecular Biology, University of Salzburg, Salzburg, Austria.

HES is defined by persistent and marked eosinophilia and eosinophil-related organ damage in the absence of any evident cause of hypereosinophilia. Two variants of HES have been characterized, with different prognosis and possible associations with malignant diseases such as myeloid leukemia or T-cell lymphomas. The lymphocytic variant of HES (L-HES) is characterized by the presence of T cell clones, IL-5 expression and possible progression to T-cell lymphoma. Besides steroid therapy, the anti-IL-5 monoclonal antibody mepolizumab is considered as a target therapy for L-HES. The myeloproliferative variant of HES (M-HES) is associated with an increased risk of myeloid leukemia and good response to anti-tyrosine-kinase therapy. The imatinib target is a kinase resulting from an 800-kb deletion on chromosome 4. The fusion gene Fip1-like 1-platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha (FIP1L1-PDGFRA) has been validated as a marker of response to anti-tyrosine-kinase therapy.

Differential protein spots were identified by mass spectrometry for peptide mass fingerprint in combination with database searching from SWISS-PROT. Then 3 protein spots were selected to verify at protein and mRNA levels by Western blot and semi-quantitative RT-PCR, separately. RESULTS: Comparing gel pages from CML-CP and CML-BC, the expression of 13 protein spots decreased and 25 protein spots increased significantly in CML-BC.

METHOD: Between January 1999 and December 2007, 76 children (< 18 years) with newly diagnosed APL were included. RESULTS: Six cases failed to achieve hematological complete remission (CR) due to early death. Three groups of patients were identified according to the different induction regimen. Forty-four patients were given all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) alone (group1, G1), 7 patients were given As(2)O(3) alone (group 2, G2), 19 patients (group 3, G3) were treated with combination of ATRA and As(2)O(3). The CR rate of G1 was 100%. The overall CR rate of G2 + G3 was 100%. Five children underwent hematologic relapse and 2 developed molecular relapse. The 5-year cumulative incidence of relapse was 13.8%, whereas event-free (EFS), disease-free (DFS) and overall survival rates were 79.5%, 86.3% and 90.5%, respectively. The 5-year estimate of EFS and DFS between G1 and G2 + G3 had no significant difference.

Furthermore, when mercaptopurine dosages are adjusted in patients who are heterozygous at the TPMT locus, there are still some patients who develop toxicity for reasons that are not fully understood. Therefore, we recently studied the effects of a common polymorphism in another gene encoding an enzyme involved in mercaptopurine metabolism (SNP rs1127354 in inosine-triphospate-pyrophosphatase, ITPA), showing that genetic polymorphism of ITPA is a significant determinant of mercaptopurine metabolism and of febrile neutropenia following combination chemotherapy of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) in which mercaptopurine doses are individualized based on TPMT genotype. AREA COVERED IN THIS REVIEW: In this review, we summarize the knowledge available about the effect and clinical relevance of TPMT and ITPA on mercaptopurine pharmacogenomics, with a particular focus on the use of this medication in pediatric patients with ALL. WHAT THE READER WILL GAIN: Reader will gain insights into: i) the effects of pharmacogenomic traits on mercaptopurine toxicity and efficacy for the treatment of ALL and ii) individualization strategies that can be used to mitigate toxicity without compromising efficacy in pediatric patients with ALL. TAKE HOME MESSAGE: Mercaptopurine dose can be adjusted on the basis of TPMT genotype to mitigate toxicity in pediatric patients with ALL. As treatment is individualized in this way for the most relevant genetic determinant of drug response (i.e., for mercaptopurine, TPMT), the importance of other genetic polymorphisms emerges (e.g., ITPA).","['Stocco, Gabriele', 'Crews, Kristine R', 'Evans, William E']","['Stocco G', 'Crews KR', 'Evans WE']","[""St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, 262 Danny Thomas Place MS 272, Memphis, TN 38105, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,England,Expert Opin Drug Saf,Expert opinion on drug safety,101163027,"['0 (Nucleotide Transport Proteins)', 'E7WED276I5 (Mercaptopurine)', 'EC 2.1.1.- (Methyltransferases)', 'EC 2.1.1.67 (thiopurine methyltransferase)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (Pyrophosphatases)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (inosine triphosphatase)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Child', 'Humans', 'Mercaptopurine/administration & dosage/*adverse effects/*pharmacokinetics', 'Methyltransferases/*genetics', 'Models, Biological', 'Neutropenia/chemically induced', 'Nucleotide Transport Proteins/genetics', '*Polymorphism, Genetic', 'Precision Medicine', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/*genetics', 'Pyrophosphatases/*genetics']",2009/12/22 06:00,2010/03/05 06:00,['2009/12/22 06:00'],"['2009/12/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/12/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/03/05 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1517/14740330903426151 [doi]'],ppublish,Expert Opin Drug Saf. 2010 Jan;9(1):23-37. doi: 10.1517/14740330903426151.,9,,,,,91,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Eph-ephrin interactions result in bidirectional signaling within both receptor- and ligand-bearing cells, with diverse consequences for cell morphology and behavior. Such interactions are especially important during early vertebrate development, and growing evidence has revealed equally important roles in adult-tissue homeostasis. As for the Eph receptors, abnormal expression of ephrins is associated with disease, especially cancer. The ephrins have received less attention than the Ephs in the literature, owing, in part, to their later discovery and that they are fewer in number.

Depletion of extracellular asparagine inhibits the growth of lymphocytic leukemic cells. Unlike normal cells, lymphoblasts lack the enzyme to synthesize asparagine and therefore rely on an exogenous source of this amino acid to maintain cellular protein synthesis. Asparagine depletion results in nutritional deprivation, inhibition of protein synthesis, and subsequent apoptotic cell death in lymphoblasts. Asparaginase therapy is an essential component of the treatment protocol for acute lymphoblastic leukemia. The effect of asparaginase on protein synthesis may result in a number of toxicities, including thrombosis, pancreatitis, hyperglycemia, and hepatotoxicity.

We examined CD2 expression in malignant and normal T cells to determine if the level of CD2 expression differed significantly and if quantitation assisted in detecting this difference. METHOD: Flow cytometric immunophenotypic (FCI) evaluation was performed on specimens from 36 patients with mature T-cell neoplasia. Abnormal T cells were identified based upon the abnormal FCI and morphology. Levels of CD2 expression were quantitated using 1:1 PE conjugates of anti-CD2 and QuantiBRITE bead standards to calculate the antibodies bound per cell (ABC). The efficacy of ABC measurement versus simple examination of dots plots was compared. RESULTS: Abnormal levels of CD2 expression were frequently observed in mature T-cell malignancies. The CD2 ABC values were highly sensitive in detecting differences between malignant and normal T cells (P = 0.0028). In most cases (24/32 specimens, 75%), CD2 ABCs differed by >20%. CD2 ABCs had high variability in normal T cells. CONCLUSIONS: CD2 expression by malignant T cells differed significantly from that of normal T-cells by CD2 ABC quantitation. The high variability in normal T-cell CD2 ABCs limited the determination of normal reference ranges and, thus, its utility in the diagnosis of T-cell neoplasia. However, examination of CD2 can help in detection of tumor cells when residual normal T cells are present for comparison. Moreover, the increased sensitivity of CD2 quantitation is valuable in confirming FCI cases where abnormalities in CD2 expression are difficult to appreciate by visual inspection alone.","['Arun, Indu', 'Wulu, Jacqueline A', 'Janik, John E', 'Jasper, Gregory A', 'Yuan, Constance M', 'Venzon, David', 'Stetler-Stevenson, Maryalice']","['Arun I', 'Wulu JA', 'Janik JE', 'Jasper GA', 'Yuan CM', 'Venzon D', 'Stetler-Stevenson M']","['Flow Cytometry Unit, Laboratory of Pathology, Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland 20892, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural']",,United States,Cytometry B Clin Cytom,"Cytometry.

As an approach to understanding the duration of the preclinical phase of different types of malignant diseases, we investigated prediagnostic hemoglobin concentration changes in a large cohort of blood donors. Using a nested case-control design, we analyzed a population-based cohort comprising 1.1 million Scandinavian blood donors with complete follow-up through record linkage to population and cancer registers. A total of 16,375 cancer cases were identified, for whom we selected 161,995 controls. We used conditional logistic regression to estimate the risk of cancer in relation to hemoglobin concentration during the 5 years preceding the cancer diagnosis. Hemoglobin concentration decline began already 3 years before diagnosis of stomach cancer, multiple myeloma, and lymphatic leukemia; 2 years before diagnosis of small intestinal and colon cancer as well as of Hodgkin lymphoma. A decline was evident during the last year for non-Hodgkin lymphoma and myeloid/monocytic leukemia, whereas no change was found for cancer of the esophagus, breast or prostate. In conclusion, in this study, we have demonstrated that the pattern of declining hemoglobin concentration before cancer diagnosis varies considerably between malignancies without being a suitable screening tool for any of them. For some malignancies, however, the long duration of hemoglobin decline before clinical diagnosis suggests a substantial lead-time with systemic effects, during which earlier diagnosis should be achievable by emerging diagnostic tools.","['Edgren, Gustaf', 'Bagnardi, Vincenzo', 'Bellocco, Rino', 'Hjalgrim, Henrik', 'Rostgaard, Klaus', 'Melbye, Mads', 'Reilly, Marie', 'Adami, Hans-Olov', 'Hall, Per', 'Nyren, Olof']","['Edgren G', 'Bagnardi V', 'Bellocco R', 'Hjalgrim H', 'Rostgaard K', 'Melbye M', 'Reilly M', 'Adami HO', 'Hall P', 'Nyren O']","['Department of Medical Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,['0 (Hemoglobins)'],IM,"['Blood Donors', 'Cohort Studies', 'Hemoglobins/*analysis', 'Humans', 'Neoplasms/*blood/classification']",2009/12/19 06:00,2010/08/25 06:00,['2009/12/19 06:00'],"['2009/12/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/12/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/08/25 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/ijc.25122 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Cancer. 2010 Sep 1;127(6):1429-36. doi: 10.1002/ijc.25122.,127,['N01-CP-21175/CP/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: We reviewed 41 cases of either histopathologically or radiologically verified bilateral orbital lesions. The number and entities in each category were recorded. Clinical data and imaging findings were reviewed. RESULTS: The number and percentage of lesions in each general category were leukemia lesions in eight patients (19.5%), metastatic tumors in seven (17%), optic nerve and meningeal tumors in six (14.6%), secondary tumors in six (14.6%), peripheral nerve lesions in four (9.8%), inflammatory lesions in four (9.8%), and vasculogenic, histiocytic, and miscellaneous lesions, each in two patients (4.9%). These lesions occurred in both childhood and adulthood, but were infrequent in people over 60 years old. Of all cases, 51.2% were benign and 48.8% were malignant. The ocular symptoms and signs presented unilaterally in 18 (43.9%) cases and bilaterally in 23 (56.1%). Of the 15 patients with either metastatic tumors or blood disorders, two (13.3%) had a history of primary neoplasm at presentation. In 19 (46.3%) cases, the configuration of the bilateral lesions was symmetrical, and they were of equal size. Computed tomography scans revealed bone changes in 13 patients (31.7%), while magnetic resonance imaging revealed intracranial extension in nine (22%).

Therefore, the development of new chemotherapeutic agents that are not substrates of these transporters is important. We have recently demonstrated that some members of a novel series of pyrrolo-1,5-benzoxazepine (PBOX) compounds are microtubule-depolymerising agents that potently induce apoptosis in several cancer cell lines and impair growth of mouse breast tumours. The aim of this current study was to establish whether PBOXs were capable of inducing apoptosis in cancer cells expressing either P-glycoprotein or breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP), two of the main ABC transporters associated with MDR. METHODS: We performed in vitro studies to assess the effects of PBOXs on cell proliferation, cell cycle and apoptosis in human cancer cell lines and their drug-resistant substrains expressing either P-glycoprotein or BCRP. In addition, we performed a preliminary molecular docking study to examine interactions between PBOXs and P-glycoprotein. RESULTS: We established that three representative PBOXs, PBOX-6, -15 and -16 were capable of inducing apoptosis in drug-resistant HL60-MDR1 cells (expressing P-glycoprotein) and HL60-ABCG2 cells (expressing BCRP) with similar potencies as in parental human promyelocytic leukaemia HL60 cells. Likewise, resistance to PBOX-6 and -16 was not evident in P-glycoprotein-expressing A2780-ADR cells in comparison with parent human ovarian carcinoma A2780 cells. Finally, we deduced by molecular docking that PBOX-6 is not likely to form favourable interactions with the substrate binding site of P-glycoprotein. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that pro-apoptotic PBOX compounds may be potential candidates for the treatment of P-glycoprotein- or BCRP-associated MDR cancers.","['Nathwani, Seema-Maria', 'Butler, Stephen', 'Fayne, Darren', 'McGovern, Naomi N', 'Sarkadi, Balazs', 'Meegan, Mary J', 'Lloyd, David G', 'Campiani, Giuseppe', 'Lawler, Mark', 'Williams, D Clive', 'Zisterer, Daniela M']","['Nathwani SM', 'Butler S', 'Fayne D', 'McGovern NN', 'Sarkadi B', 'Meegan MJ', 'Lloyd DG', 'Campiani G', 'Lawler M', 'Williams DC', 'Zisterer DM']","['School of Biochemistry and Immunology, Trinity College, Dublin 2, Ireland. nathwans@tcd.ie']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20091218,Germany,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol,Cancer chemotherapy and pharmacology,7806519,"['0', '(4-((N,N-dimethylcarbamoyl)oxy)-5-(naphth-1-yl)naphtho(2,3-b)pyrrolo(1,2-d)(1,4)o', 'xazepine)', '0 (4-acetoxy-5-(1-(naphthyl))naphtho(2,3-b)pyrrolo(2,1-d)(1,4)oxazepine)', '0 (ABCG2 protein, human)', '0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily G, Member 2)', '0 (ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzazepines)', '0 (Carbamates)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Oxazepines)', '0 (Pyrroles)', '0 (Tubulin Modulators)', 'IN93MQ497D (PBOX-6)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/metabolism', 'ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily G, Member 2', 'ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters/metabolism', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Benzazepines/pharmacology', 'Carbamates/pharmacology', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Drug Resistance, Multiple', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Microtubules/drug effects/metabolism', 'Neoplasm Proteins/metabolism', 'Neoplasms/drug therapy/pathology', 'Oxazepines/*pharmacology', 'Pyrroles/*pharmacology', 'Tubulin Modulators/*pharmacology']",2009/12/19 06:00,2010/07/14 06:00,['2009/12/19 06:00'],"['2009/09/18 00:00 [received]', '2009/11/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/12/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/12/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/07/14 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00280-009-1200-9 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol. 2010 Aug;66(3):585-96. doi: 10.1007/s00280-009-1200-9.

Besides these physiological aspects, their role in pathological processes especially with respect to solid tumour and haematological neoplasias is well established. In this context, the focus was set here on disclosing their contribution in B cell chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (B-CLL), which is regarded as the most characteristic low-grade lymphoma. Up to now, it has been demonstrated that several chemokines are involved in migration of B-CLL cells to lymph nodes, secondary lymphoid organs and bone marrow. Moreover, some chemokines are known to have an anti-apoptotic effect and thus contribute to the survival of B-CLL cells. By interfering with both of these aspects, new therapeutic targets for this yet incurable disease may be developed. Furthermore, a correlation can be drawn between the concentration of some chemokines in patients' serum, the expression of their respective receptors on B-CLL cells and well-established predictive clinical parameters. Consequently, further systematic investigation of the chemokine network may lead to the identification of new diagnostic and prognostic markers. This review focuses on the impact of chemokines and their receptors on B-CLL pathophysiology and points out potential implications for both treatment and diagnosis.","['Schrottner, Percy', 'Leick, Marion', 'Burger, Meike']","['Schrottner P', 'Leick M', 'Burger M']","['Department of Hematology and Oncology, University Clinic of Freiburg, Hugstetterstr. 55, 79106 Freiburg, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20091218,Germany,Ann Hematol,Annals of hematology,9107334,"['0 (Chemokines)', '0 (Receptors, Chemokine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'B-Lymphocyte Subsets/metabolism/pathology', 'Cell Movement/immunology', 'Chemokines/biosynthesis/classification/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*metabolism/pathology/*physiopathology/therapy', 'Lymphocyte Activation/immunology', 'Receptors, Chemokine/*physiology']",2009/12/19 06:00,2010/04/13 06:00,['2009/12/19 06:00'],"['2008/11/20 00:00 [received]', '2009/11/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/12/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/12/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/04/13 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00277-009-0876-6 [doi]'],ppublish,Ann Hematol. 2010 May;89(5):437-46. doi: 10.1007/s00277-009-0876-6.

DATA SOURCES: Searches of MEDLINE (1950-2009) and other electronic databases yielded 31 included studies. DATA EXTRACTION: Two authors independently abstracted data and assessed the quality of each study. DATA SYNTHESIS: Random effects models were used to obtain summary odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). There was no overall association between childhood leukemia and any paternal occupational pesticide exposure (OR = 1.09; 95% CI, 0.88-1.34); there were slightly elevated risks in subgroups of studies with low total-quality scores (OR = 1.39; 95% CI, 0.99-1.95), ill-defined exposure time windows (OR = 1.36; 95% CI, 1.00-1.85), and exposure information collected after offspring leukemia diagnosis (OR = 1.34; 95% CI, 1.05-1.70). Childhood leukemia was associated with prenatal maternal occupational pesticide exposure (OR = 2.09; 95% CI, 1.51-2.88); this association was slightly stronger for studies with high exposure-measurement-quality scores (OR = 2.45; 95% CI, 1.68-3.58), higher confounder control scores (OR = 2.38; 95% CI, 1.56-3.62), and farm-related exposures (OR = 2.44; 95% CI, 1.53-3.89). Childhood leukemia risk was also elevated for prenatal maternal occupational exposure to insecticides (OR = 2.72; 95% CI, 1.47-5.04) and herbicides (OR = 3.62; 95% CI, 1.28-10.3). CONCLUSIONS: Childhood leukemia was associated with prenatal maternal occupational pesticide exposure in analyses of all studies combined and in several subgroups. Associations with paternal occupational pesticide exposure were weaker and less consistent. Research needs include improved pesticide exposure indices, continued follow-up of existing cohorts, genetic susceptibility assessment, and basic research on childhood leukemia initiation and progression.","['Wigle, Donald T', 'Turner, Michelle C', 'Krewski, Daniel']","['Wigle DT', 'Turner MC', 'Krewski D']","['McLaughlin Centre for Population Health Risk Assessment, University of Ottawa, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada. don.wigle@sympatico.ca']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Meta-Analysis', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review', 'Systematic Review']",20090519,United States,Environ Health Perspect,Environmental health perspectives,0330411,['0 (Pesticides)'],IM,"['Child', 'Child, Preschool', '*Environmental Exposure', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*epidemiology/*etiology', 'Male', '*Maternal Exposure', '*Occupational Exposure', '*Paternal Exposure', 'Pesticides/*toxicity']",2009/12/19 06:00,2010/03/04 06:00,['2009/12/19 06:00'],"['2009/01/15 00:00 [received]', '2009/05/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/12/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/12/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/03/04 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1289/ehp.0900582 [doi]'],ppublish,Environ Health Perspect. 2009 Oct;117(10):1505-13. doi: 10.1289/ehp.0900582.

However, the initial molecular events leading to its up-regulation in MDR tumor cells are poorly understood. Herein, we explored the impact of drug treatment on the methylation status of the ABCG2 promoter and consequent reactivation of ABCG2 gene expression in parental tumor cell lines and their MDR sublines. We demonstrate that ABCG2 promoter methylation is common in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) lines, also present in primary T-ALL lymphoblast specimens. Furthermore, drug selection with sulfasalazine and topotecan induced a complete demethylation of the ABCG2 promoter in the T-ALL and ovarian carcinoma model cell lines CCRF-CEM and IGROV1, respectively. This resulted in a dramatic induction of ABCG2 messenger RNA levels (235- and 743-fold, respectively) and consequent acquisition of an ABCG2-dependent MDR phenotype. Quantitative genomic polymerase chain reaction and ABCG2 promoter-luciferase reporter assay did not reveal ABCG2 gene amplification or differential transcriptional trans-activation, which could account for ABCG2 up-regulation in these MDR cells. Remarkably, mimicking cytotoxic bolus drug treatment through 12- to 24-hour pulse exposure of ABCG2-silenced leukemia cells, to clinically relevant concentrations of the chemotherapeutic agents daunorubicin and mitoxantrone, resulted in a marked transcriptional up-regulation of ABCG2. Our findings establish that antitumor drug-induced epigenetic reactivation of ABCG2 gene expression in cancer cells is an early molecular event leading to MDR. These findings have important implications for the emergence, clonal selection, and expansion of malignant cells with the MDR phenotype during chemotherapy.","['Bram, Eran E', 'Stark, Michal', 'Raz, Shachar', 'Assaraf, Yehuda G']","['Bram EE', 'Stark M', 'Raz S', 'Assaraf YG']","['The Fred Wyszkowski Cancer Research Laboratory, Department of Biology, Technion-Israel Institute of Technology, Haifa, Israel.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Neoplasia,"Neoplasia (New York, N.Y.)",100886622,"['0 (ABCG2 protein, human)', '0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily G, Member 2)', '0 (ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '5CSZ8459RP (Cytidine)', '776B62CQ27 (Decitabine)', '7A9Y5SX0GY (pyrimidin-2-one beta-ribofuranoside)', 'M801H13NRU (Azacitidine)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily G, Member 2', 'ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters/*genetics', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Azacitidine/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cytidine/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', '*DNA Methylation', 'Decitabine', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'K562 Cells', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*genetics', 'Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics/pathology', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/*genetics', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction']",2009/12/19 06:00,2010/04/28 06:00,['2009/12/19 06:00'],"['2009/08/02 00:00 [received]', '2009/09/11 00:00 [revised]', '2009/09/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/12/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/12/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/04/28 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1593/neo.91314 [doi]'],ppublish,Neoplasia. 2009 Dec;11(12):1359-70. doi: 10.1593/neo.91314.,11,,,PMC2794517,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, little is known about the association of epigenetic abnormalities with multistep tumorigenic events in adult T cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATLL). To determine whether epigenetic abnormalities induce the progression of ATLL, we analyzed the methylation profiles of the SHP1, p15, p16, p73, HCAD, DAPK, hMLH-1, and MGMT genes by methylation specific PCR assay in 65 cases with ATLL patients. The number of CpG island methylated genes increased with disease progression and aberrant hypermethylation in specific genes was detected even in HTLV-1 carriers and correlated with progression to ATLL. The CpG island methylator phenotype (CIMP) was observed most frequently in lymphoma type ATLL and was also closely associated with the progression and crisis of ATLL. The high number of methylated genes and increase of CIMP incidence were shown to be unfavorable prognostic factors and correlated with a shorter overall survival by Kaplan-Meyer analysis. The present findings strongly suggest that the multistep accumulation of aberrant CpG methylation in specific target genes and the presence of CIMP are deeply involved in the crisis, progression, and prognosis of ATLL, as well as indicate the value of CpG methylation and CIMP for new diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers.","['Sato, Hiaki', 'Oka, Takashi', 'Shinnou, Yoko', 'Kondo, Takami', 'Washio, Kana', 'Takano, Masayuki', 'Takata, Katsuyoshi', 'Morito, Toshiaki', 'Huang, Xingang', 'Tamura, Maiko', 'Kitamura, Yuta', 'Ohara, Nobuya', 'Ouchida, Mamoru', 'Ohshima, Koichi', 'Shimizu, Kenji', 'Tanimoto, Mitsune', 'Takahashi, Kiyoshi', 'Matsuoka, Masao', 'Utsunomiya, Atae', 'Yoshino, Tadashi']","['Sato H', 'Oka T', 'Shinnou Y', 'Kondo T', 'Washio K', 'Takano M', 'Takata K', 'Morito T', 'Huang X', 'Tamura M', 'Kitamura Y', 'Ohara N', 'Ouchida M', 'Ohshima K', 'Shimizu K', 'Tanimoto M', 'Takahashi K', 'Matsuoka M', 'Utsunomiya A', 'Yoshino T']","['Departments of Pathology & Oncology, Graduate School of Medicine, Dentistry, and Pharmaceutical Sciences, Okayama University, Okayama 700-8558, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20091217,United States,Am J Pathol,The American journal of pathology,0370502,['0 (Neoplasm Proteins)'],IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Base Sequence', 'CpG Islands/*genetics', 'DNA Methylation/*genetics', 'Disease Progression', 'Gene Silencing', 'Genes, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Humans', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*genetics/*pathology', 'Middle Aged', 'Models, Genetic', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Neoplasm Proteins/metabolism', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction']",2009/12/19 06:00,2010/03/17 06:00,['2009/12/19 06:00'],"['2009/12/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/12/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/03/17 06:00 [medline]']","['S0002-9440(10)60355-0 [pii]', '10.2353/ajpath.2010.090236 [doi]']",ppublish,Am J Pathol. 2010 Jan;176(1):402-15. doi: 10.2353/ajpath.2010.090236.

Point mutations within the activation loop and in-frame tandem duplications of the juxtamembrane domain represent the most frequent molecular abnormalities observed in acute myeloid leukemia. Interestingly these gain-of-function mutations correlate with different clinical outcomes, suggesting that signals from constitutive FLT3 mutants activate different downstream targets. In principle, mass spectrometry offers a powerful means to quantify protein phosphorylation and identify signaling events associated with constitutively active kinases or other oncogenic events. However, regulation of individual phosphorylation sites presents a challenging case for proteomics studies whereby quantification is based on individual peptides rather than an average across different peptides derived from the same protein. Here we describe a robust experimental framework and associated error model for iTRAQ-based quantification on an Orbitrap mass spectrometer that relates variance of peptide ratios to mass spectral peak height and provides for assignment of p value, q value, and confidence interval to every peptide identification, all based on routine measurements, obviating the need for detailed characterization of individual ion peaks. Moreover, we demonstrate that our model is stable over time and can be applied in a manner directly analogous to ubiquitously used external mass calibration routines.

These mice lack B, T, and natural killer (NK) cells, and, in contrast to nude mice that retain NK cells, appear to be optimal recipient for MEC1 cells, which were successfully transplanted through either subcutaneous or intravenous routes. The result is a novel in vivo model that has systemic involvement, develops very rapidly, allows the measurement of tumor burden, and has 100% engraftment efficiency.

Here, we demonstrate that MVs circulating in plasma of B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) patients exhibit a phenotypic shift from predominantly platelet derived in early stage to leukemic B-cell derived at advanced stage. Furthermore, the total MV level in CLL was significantly greater compared with healthy subjects. To understand the functional implication, we examined whether MVs can interact and modulate CLL bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) known to provide a ""homing and nurturing"" environment for CLL B cells. We found that CLL-MV can activate the AKT/mammalian target of rapamycin/p70S6K/hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha axis in CLL-BMSCs with production of vascular endothelial growth factor, a survival factor for CLL B cells. Moreover, MV-mediated AKT activation led to modulation of the beta-catenin pathway and increased expression of cyclin D1 and c-myc in BMSCs. We found MV delivered phospho-receptor tyrosine kinase Axl directly to the BMSCs in association with AKT activation. This study demonstrates the existence of separate MV phenotypes during leukemic disease progression and underscores the important role of MVs in activation of the tumor microenvironment.","['Ghosh, Asish K', 'Secreto, Charla R', 'Knox, Traci R', 'Ding, Wei', 'Mukhopadhyay, Debabrata', 'Kay, Neil E']","['Ghosh AK', 'Secreto CR', 'Knox TR', 'Ding W', 'Mukhopadhyay D', 'Kay NE']","['Division of Hematology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20091217,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (CTNNB1 protein, human)', '0 (HIF1A protein, human)', '0 (Hypoxia-Inducible Factor 1, alpha Subunit)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (VEGFA protein, human)', '0 (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A)', '0 (beta Catenin)', 'EC 2.7.1.1 (MTOR protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3 beta)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Ribosomal Protein S6 Kinases, 70-kDa)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.26 (Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3)']",IM,"['Bone Marrow Cells/metabolism/*pathology', 'Cell Line', 'Cell-Derived Microparticles/metabolism/*pathology', 'Disease Progression', 'Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3/metabolism', 'Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3 beta', 'Humans', 'Hypoxia-Inducible Factor 1, alpha Subunit/metabolism', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/blood/metabolism/*pathology', 'Microscopy, Electron, Transmission', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/metabolism', 'Ribosomal Protein S6 Kinases, 70-kDa/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Stromal Cells/metabolism/pathology', 'TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A/metabolism', 'beta Catenin/metabolism']",2009/12/19 06:00,2010/04/03 06:00,['2009/12/19 06:00'],"['2009/12/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/12/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/04/03 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)56700-1 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2009-09-242719 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2010 Mar 4;115(9):1755-64. doi: 10.1182/blood-2009-09-242719.

It is also suggested to shuttle ubiquitinated proteins for proteasomal degradation. p62 is commonly found in cytosolic protein inclusions in patients with protein aggregopathies, it is up-regulated in several forms of human tumors, and mutations in the gene are linked to classical adult onset Paget disease of the bone. To this end, p62 has generally been considered to be a cytosolic protein, and little attention has been paid to possible nuclear roles of this protein. Here, we present evidence that p62 shuttles continuously between nuclear and cytosolic compartments at a high rate. The protein is also found in nuclear promyelocytic leukemia bodies. We show that p62 contains two nuclear localization signals and a nuclear export signal. Our data suggest that the nucleocytoplasmic shuttling of p62 is modulated by phosphorylations at or near the most important nuclear localization signal, NLS2. The aggregation of p62 in cytosolic bodies also regulates the transport of p62 between the compartments. We found p62 to be essential for accumulation of polyubiquitinated proteins in promyelocytic leukemia bodies upon inhibition of nuclear protein export. Furthermore, p62 contributed to the assembly of proteasome-containing degradative compartments in the vicinity of nuclear aggregates containing polyglutamine-expanded Ataxin1Q84 and to the degradation of Ataxin1Q84.","['Pankiv, Serhiy', 'Lamark, Trond', 'Bruun, Jack-Ansgar', 'Overvatn, Aud', 'Bjorkoy, Geir', 'Johansen, Terje']","['Pankiv S', 'Lamark T', 'Bruun JA', 'Overvatn A', 'Bjorkoy G', 'Johansen T']","['Molecular Cancer Research Group, Institute of Medical Biology, University of Tromso, 9037 Tromso, Norway.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20091215,United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (ATXN1 protein, human)', '0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (Ataxin-1)', '0 (Ataxins)', '0 (Nerve Tissue Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Localization Signals)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Peptides)', '0 (SQSTM1 protein, human)', '0 (Sequestosome-1 Protein)', '26700-71-0 (polyglutamine)', 'EC 3.4.25.1 (Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex)']",IM,"['Active Transport, Cell Nucleus/genetics', 'Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing/genetics/*metabolism', 'Ataxin-1', 'Ataxins', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Intranuclear Inclusion Bodies/genetics/*metabolism', 'Intranuclear Space/*metabolism', 'Nerve Tissue Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Nuclear Localization Signals/genetics/*metabolism', 'Nuclear Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Peptides/genetics/metabolism', 'Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex/genetics/metabolism', 'Sequestosome-1 Protein', '*Ubiquitination']",2009/12/19 06:00,2010/03/12 06:00,['2009/12/19 06:00'],"['2009/12/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/12/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/03/12 06:00 [medline]']","['S0021-9258(19)37569-6 [pii]', '10.1074/jbc.M109.039925 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2010 Feb 19;285(8):5941-53. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M109.039925.

This process is intrinsically very slow in most GTPases but is significantly accelerated by guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs). Nucleotide exchange in small GTPases has been widely studied using spectroscopy with fluorescently tagged nucleotides. However, this method suffers from effects of the bulky fluorescent moiety covalently attached to the nucleotide. Here, we have used a newly developed real-time NMR-based assay to monitor small GTPase RhoA nucleotide exchange by probing the RhoA conformation. We compared RhoA nucleotide exchange from GDP to GTP and GTP analogues in the absence and presence of the catalytic DH-PH domain of PDZ-RhoGEF (DH-PH(PRG)). Using the non-hydrolyzable analogue guanosine-5'-O-(3-thiotriphosphate), which we found to be a reliable mimic of GTP, we obtained an intrinsic nucleotide exchange rate of 5.5 x 10(-4) min(-1). This reaction is markedly accelerated to 1179 x 10(-4) min(-1) in the presence of DH-PH(PRG) at a ratio of 1:8,000 relative to RhoA. Mutagenesis studies confirmed the importance of Arg-868 near a conserved region (CR3) of the Dbl homology (DH) domain and revealed that Glu-741 in CR1 is critical for full activity of DH-PH(PRG), together suggesting that the catalytic mechanism of PDZ-RhoGEF is similar to Tiam1. Mutation of the single RhoA (E97A) residue that contacts the pleckstrin homology (PH) domain rendered the mutant 10-fold less sensitive to the activity of DH-PH(PRG). Interestingly, this mutation does not affect RhoA activation by leukemia-associated RhoGEF (LARG), indicating that the PH domains of these two homologous GEFs may play different roles.","['Gasmi-Seabrook, Genevieve M C', 'Marshall, Christopher B', 'Cheung, Melissa', 'Kim, Bryan', 'Wang, Feng', 'Jang, Ying Ju', 'Mak, Tak W', 'Stambolic, Vuk', 'Ikura, Mitsuhiko']","['Gasmi-Seabrook GM', 'Marshall CB', 'Cheung M', 'Kim B', 'Wang F', 'Jang YJ', 'Mak TW', 'Stambolic V', 'Ikura M']","['Division of Signaling Biology, Ontario Cancer Institute, University Health Network, Toronto, Ontario M5G 1L7, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20091217,United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (ARHGEF12 protein, human)', '0 (Guanine Nucleotide Exchange Factors)', '0 (Rho Guanine Nucleotide Exchange Factors)', '124671-05-2 (RHOA protein, human)', '146-91-8 (Guanosine Diphosphate)', '86-01-1 (Guanosine Triphosphate)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (rhoA GTP-Binding Protein)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Substitution', 'Guanine Nucleotide Exchange Factors/*chemistry/genetics/metabolism', 'Guanosine Diphosphate/*chemistry/metabolism', 'Guanosine Triphosphate/*chemistry/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Mutagenesis', 'Mutation, Missense', 'Nuclear Magnetic Resonance, Biomolecular/*methods', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Rho Guanine Nucleotide Exchange Factors', 'rhoA GTP-Binding Protein/*chemistry/genetics/metabolism']",2009/12/19 06:00,2010/03/12 06:00,['2009/12/19 06:00'],"['2009/12/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/12/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/03/12 06:00 [medline]']","['S0021-9258(19)37490-3 [pii]', '10.1074/jbc.M109.064691 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2010 Feb 19;285(8):5137-45. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M109.064691.

We identified the type I cytokine receptor subunit CRLF2 in a functional screen for B-ALL-derived mRNA transcripts that can substitute for IL3 signaling. We demonstrate that CRLF2 is overexpressed in approximately 15% of adult and high-risk pediatric B-ALL that lack MLL, TCF3, TEL, and BCR/ABL rearrangements, but not in B-ALL with these rearrangements or other lymphoid malignancies. CRLF2 overexpression can result from translocation with the IGH locus or intrachromosomal deletion and is associated with poor outcome. CRLF2 overexpressing B-ALLs share a transcriptional signature that significantly overlaps with a BCR/ABL signature, and is enriched for genes involved in cytokine receptor and JAK-STAT signaling. In a subset of cases, CRLF2 harbors a Phe232Cys gain-of-function mutation that promotes constitutive dimerization and cytokine independent growth. A mutually exclusive subset harbors activating mutations in JAK2. In fact, all 22 B-ALLs with mutant JAK2 that we analyzed overexpress CRLF2, distinguishing CRLF2 as the key scaffold for mutant JAK2 signaling in B-ALL. Expression of WT CRLF2 with mutant JAK2 also promotes cytokine independent growth that, unlike CRLF2 Phe232Cys or ligand-induced signaling by WT CRLF2, is accompanied by JAK2 phosphorylation. Finally, cells dependent on CRLF2 signaling are sensitive to small molecule inhibitors of either JAKs or protein kinase C family kinases. Together, these findings implicate CRLF2 as an important factor in B-ALL with diagnostic, prognostic, and therapeutic implications.","['Yoda, Akinori', 'Yoda, Yuka', 'Chiaretti, Sabina', 'Bar-Natan, Michal', 'Mani, Kartik', 'Rodig, Scott J', 'West, Nathan', 'Xiao, Yun', 'Brown, Jennifer R', 'Mitsiades, Constantine', 'Sattler, Martin', 'Kutok, Jeffrey L', 'DeAngelo, Daniel J', 'Wadleigh, Martha', 'Piciocchi, Alfonso', 'Dal Cin, Paola', 'Bradner, James E', 'Griffin, James D', 'Anderson, Kenneth C', 'Stone, Richard M', 'Ritz, Jerome', 'Foa, Robin', 'Aster, Jon C', 'Frank, David A', 'Weinstock, David M']","['Yoda A', 'Yoda Y', 'Chiaretti S', 'Bar-Natan M', 'Mani K', 'Rodig SJ', 'West N', 'Xiao Y', 'Brown JR', 'Mitsiades C', 'Sattler M', 'Kutok JL', 'DeAngelo DJ', 'Wadleigh M', 'Piciocchi A', 'Dal Cin P', 'Bradner JE', 'Griffin JD', 'Anderson KC', 'Stone RM', 'Ritz J', 'Foa R', 'Aster JC', 'Frank DA', 'Weinstock DM']","['Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02115, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20091215,United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (CRLF2 protein, human)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Receptors, Cytokine)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 2)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Child', 'Cytokines/metabolism', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Janus Kinase 2/genetics/metabolism', 'Male', 'Mutation', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/diagnosis/*genetics/metabolism', 'Prognosis', 'Receptors, Cytokine/*genetics/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/*physiology', 'Survival Rate', 'Transcription, Genetic']",2009/12/19 06:00,2010/03/10 06:00,['2009/12/19 06:00'],"['2009/12/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/12/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/03/10 06:00 [medline]']","['0911726107 [pii]', '10.1073/pnas.0911726107 [doi]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2010 Jan 5;107(1):252-7. doi: 10.1073/pnas.0911726107.

However, there is still no related or HLA-matched unrelated donor for one-third of the patients. Cord blood, which contains a lot of hematopoietic progenitors immunologically naive, represents not only an interesting alternative as hematopoietic stem cell source but also allows more HLA incompatibilities than the other sources. Promising results in children lead to develop cord blood transplantation in adults first of all in hematopoietic malignancies (acute leukemias and lymphoid diseases) and in a second time, in non-malignant diseases such as aplastic anaemia. The main problems for the development of this new strategy in adults are the poor number of cells per unit, the delay for hematopoietic recovery in comparison with other hematopoietic stem cell sources and, consequently higher transplant related mortality. In order to improve the results in adults, new strategies emerged. Double cord blood transplantation, expansion methods and intra-bone injection of the graft will be reviewed here, as well as alternative transplantation strategies such as non-myeloablative conditioning.","['Labussiere, H', 'Peffault de Latour, R', 'Bay, J-O']","['Labussiere H', 'Peffault de Latour R', 'Bay JO']","[""Hopital Edouard-Herriot, Service d'Hematologie, Place d'Arsonval, 69003 Lyon, France. helene.labussiere@gmail.com""]",['fre'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",,France,Bull Cancer,Bulletin du cancer,0072416,['0 (HLA Antigens)'],IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Cord Blood Stem Cell Transplantation/*methods', 'Fetal Blood/cytology/immunology', 'HLA Antigens/immunology', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*surgery', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/surgery', 'Lymphoma/surgery', 'Transplantation Conditioning/methods', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",2009/12/19 06:00,2010/02/04 06:00,['2009/12/19 06:00'],"['2009/12/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/12/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/02/04 06:00 [medline]']","['S0007-4551(15)30906-1 [pii]', '10.1684/bdc.2009.1021 [doi]']",ppublish,Bull Cancer. 2010 Jan;97(1):137-48. doi: 10.1684/bdc.2009.1021.,97,,,,,,,,,,,,,Allogreffe de sang placentaire chez l'adulte : actualites et perspectives.,,,,,,,

Serum samples were obtained from 30 randomly selected cows, where available, in 240 herds using monthly milk testing, within 6 of 10 provinces, and these samples were tested for antibodies against BLV, MAP and N. caninum using commercially available ELISA test kits. Five unvaccinated cattle >6 months old from each herd were tested for antibodies to BVDV using virus neutralization. Most herd-level predictors were obtained through personal interviews with questionnaires administrated to each farm manager. A mixed logistic-regression model was built using N. caninum serostatus at the cow-level as the outcome variable, with herd as a random effect and province as a fixed effect. A BLV seropositive cow was 1.50 times more likely to be seropositive for N. caninum than a BLV-seronegative cow, and this was the only cow-level variable to remain in the final model. Regarding herd-level variables, with ""no on-farm dogs"" as the baseline, ""presence of dogs but not known to eat placentas and/or fetuses"" increased the odds of seropositivity for N. caninum by a factor of 1.66.

As results, first, the incidence of nonthymic lymphomas in C57BL/6 mice and acute myeloid leukemias (AMLs) in C3H/He mice showed linear responses at the lower exposure level in Trp53-deficient mice; second, the incidence of thymic lymphomas in C57BL/6 mice and nonthymic lymphomas in C3H/He mice increased without a plateau-like ceiling; thus, the former equivocal induction of hematopoietic neoplasms (HPNs) in the case of low-dose benzene exposure was assumed to be based on the DNA repair potential in wild-type mice, and the latter limited increase in HPNs in the case of high-dose benzene exposure was considered to be due to excessive apoptosis in wild-type mice. Concerning the incidence of AMLs, though a dose of 300 ppm benzene inhalation induced 9% AMLs in wild-type C3H/He mice-AML-prone, it induced AMLs in 38% of Trp53-deficient C3H/He mice. Because AMLs were also observed in Trp53-deficient mice, including in the C57BL/6 mice, benzene exposure may also be a potent inducer of AMLs in mice with some strain differences. In the present study, to elucidate the hematopoietic stem cell-specific, aryl hydrocarbon-receptor-related low-dose adverse effect, global gene expression in the bone marrow was analyzed at 28 days after 2-week-intermittent exposure to 150 mg/kg b.w. benzene, by gavage, i.e., equivalent to the above inhalation protocol with 300 ppm. We observed two conceptually different gene expression profiles; ""common gene profiles"" (CGPs) shared among mice in each group, and ""stochastic gene profiles"" (SGPs), i.e., unique union genes from one individual mouse to another. The CGPs of the experimental group and the SGPs of each individual mouse were separately characterized by individual assay. Concerning the CGPs, reciprocal strain differences between C3H/He and C57BL/6 mice in expression gene profiles, both plausible for leukemogenesis, were identified; namely, dominant downmodulations of Sltm and Cryl1, related to suppression of apoptosis and genomic instability in C3H/He mice, respectively, and dominant downmodulations of Atrx/rad54 and Kdm2a, related to a decrease in DNA repair and genomic instability, respectively, in C57BL/6 mice. These findings imply that these reciprocal gene expression differences induced by benzene exposure may lead each strain to undergo different hematopoietic neoplastic pathways. In contrast, each individual mouse often shows a unique SGP. SGPs often include transcription factors, which regulate reciprocal signaling pathways including further SGPs. Among them, apoptosis-related genes expressed in C57BL/6 mice and those in C3H/He mice were attributable to different combinations of SGPs. Such stochastic case-by-case gene expression may be in good agreement with the individual and strain differences observed following benzene exposure. Because gene chip microarray techniques can elucidate stochastic changes in gene expression profiles, possible stochastic toxicology and its future role are discussed.","['Inoue, Tohru', 'Hirabayashi, Yoko']","['Inoue T', 'Hirabayashi Y']","['Center for Biological Safety and Research, National Institute of Health Sciences, Tokyo 158-8501, Japan. tohru@nihs.go.jp']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20091216,Ireland,Chem Biol Interact,Chemico-biological interactions,0227276,"['0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', 'J64922108F (Benzene)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Benzene/*adverse effects', 'Gene Deletion', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/drug effects', 'Genomic Instability/*drug effects', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*chemically induced', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/chemically induced', 'Lymphoma/chemically induced', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C3H', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/*genetics']",2009/12/19 06:00,2010/04/24 06:00,['2009/12/19 06:00'],"['2009/09/25 00:00 [received]', '2009/11/30 00:00 [revised]', '2009/12/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/12/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/12/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/04/24 06:00 [medline]']","['S0009-2797(09)00533-X [pii]', '10.1016/j.cbi.2009.12.005 [doi]']",ppublish,Chem Biol Interact. 2010 Mar 19;184(1-2):240-5. doi: 10.1016/j.cbi.2009.12.005.

RESULTS: Compound K was found to inhibit the viability of HL-60 cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner with an IC50 of 14 muM. Moreover, this cell death had typical features of apoptosis, that is, DNA fragmentation, DNA ladder formation, and the externalization of Annexin V targeted phosphatidylserine residues in HL-60 cells. In addition, compound-K induced a series of intracellular events associated with both the mitochondrial- and death receptor-dependent apoptotic pathways, namely, (1) the activation of caspases-3, -8, and -9; (2) the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential; (3) the release of cytochrome c and Smac/DIABLO to the cytosol; (4) the translocation of Bid and Bax to mitochondria; and (5) the downregulations of Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL. Furthermore, a caspase-8 inhibitor completely abolished caspase-3 activation, Bid cleavage, and subsequent DNA fragmentation by Compound K. Interestingly, the activation of caspase-3 and -8 and DNA fragmentation were significantly prevented in the presence of cycloheximide, suggesting that Compound K-induced apoptosis is dependent on de novo protein synthesis. CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate that caspase-8 plays a key role in Compound K-stimulated apoptosis via the activation of caspase-3 directly or indirectly through Bid cleavage, cytochrome c release, and caspase-9 activation.","['Cho, Sung-Hee', 'Chung, Kyung-Sook', 'Choi, Jung-Hye', 'Kim, Dong-Hyun', 'Lee, Kyung-Tae']","['Cho SH', 'Chung KS', 'Choi JH', 'Kim DH', 'Lee KT']","['Department of Pharmaceutical Biochemistry, College of Pharmacy, Kyung-Hee University, Seoul 130-701, South Korea.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20091218,England,BMC Cancer,BMC cancer,100967800,"['0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (DIABLO protein, human)', '0 (Ginsenosides)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Mitochondrial Proteins)', '0 (Saponins)', '9007-43-6 (Cytochromes c)', 'A9RLM212CY (ginsenoside M1)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP8 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 8)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins', 'Caspase 8/metabolism/*physiology', 'Cytochromes c/metabolism', 'Drug Evaluation, Preclinical', 'Ginsenosides/*pharmacology', 'HL-60 Cells', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/metabolism', 'Leukemia/*pathology', 'Membrane Potentials/drug effects', 'Mitochondrial Proteins/metabolism', 'Models, Biological', 'Panax/chemistry/metabolism', 'Saponins/chemistry/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects/physiology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'U937 Cells']",2009/12/19 06:00,2010/03/17 06:00,['2009/12/19 06:00'],"['2009/08/05 00:00 [received]', '2009/12/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/12/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/12/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/03/17 06:00 [medline]']","['1471-2407-9-449 [pii]', '10.1186/1471-2407-9-449 [doi]']",epublish,BMC Cancer. 2009 Dec 18;9:449. doi: 10.1186/1471-2407-9-449.,9,,,PMC2806409,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Mutation analysis was based on Denaturing high performance liquid chromatography (DHPLC) screening of exons 2-11 of the TP53 gene, sequencing, and cloning of DNA obtained from peripheral blood lymphocytes. RESULTS: We report herein on Li Fraumeni syndrome in a family whose members are carriers of a novel TP53 gene mutation at exon 4. The mutation comprises an insertion/duplication of seven nucleotides affecting codon 110 and generating a new nucleotide sequence and a premature stop codon at position 150. With this mutation, the p53 protein that should be translated lacks the majority of the DNA binding domain. CONCLUSION: To our knowledge, this specific alteration has not been reported previously, but we believe it is the cause of the Li-Fraumeni syndrome in this family.","['Taja-Chayeb, Lucia', 'Vidal-Millan, Silvia', 'Gutierrez-Hernandez, Olga', 'Trejo-Becerril, Catalina', 'Perez-Cardenas, Enrique', 'Chavez-Blanco, Alma', 'de la Cruz-Hernandez, Erick', 'Duenas-Gonzalez, Alfonso']","['Taja-Chayeb L', 'Vidal-Millan S', 'Gutierrez-Hernandez O', 'Trejo-Becerril C', 'Perez-Cardenas E', 'Chavez-Blanco A', 'de la Cruz-Hernandez E', 'Duenas-Gonzalez A']","['Instituto Nacional de Cancerologia (INCan), Mexico City, Mexico. ltaja_chayeb@yahoo.com']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20091217,England,World J Surg Oncol,World journal of surgical oncology,101170544,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (TP53 protein, human)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'DNA Primers/chemistry/genetics', 'Female', 'Germ-Line Mutation/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Li-Fraumeni Syndrome/*genetics', 'Male', 'Mexico', 'Middle Aged', 'Pedigree', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/*genetics', 'Young Adult']",2009/12/19 06:00,2010/02/03 06:00,['2009/12/19 06:00'],"['2009/08/31 00:00 [received]', '2009/12/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/12/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/12/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/02/03 06:00 [medline]']","['1477-7819-7-97 [pii]', '10.1186/1477-7819-7-97 [doi]']",epublish,World J Surg Oncol. 2009 Dec 17;7:97. doi: 10.1186/1477-7819-7-97.,7,,,PMC2806269,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have described a mouse model uniquely suited to examine the link between inflammation and lymphoma in which the Tax oncogene, expressed in activated T and NK cells, perpetuates chronic inflammation that begins as microscopic intraepithelial lesions and develops into inflammatory nodules, subcutaneous tumors, and large granular lymphocytic leukemia. The use of bioluminescent imaging in these mice has expanded our ability to interrogate aspects of inflammation and tumorigenesis non-invasively. Here we demonstrate that bioluminescence induction in these mice correlated with inflammation resulting from wounding, T cell activation, and exposure to chemical agents. In experiments in which long-term effects of inflammation on disease outcome were monitored, the development of lymphoma was promoted by an inflammatory stimulus. Finally we demonstrated that activation of T-cells in T-cell receptor (TCR) transgenic TAX-LUC animals dramatically exacerbated the development of subcutaneous TCR- CD16+ LGL tumors. The role of activated T-cells and acquired immunity in inflammation-associated cancers is broadly applicable to hematopoietic malignancies, and we propose these mice will be of use in dissecting mechanisms by which activated T-cells promote lymphomagenesis in vivo.","['Rauch, Dan', 'Gross, Shimon', 'Harding, John', 'Bokhari, Sirosh', 'Niewiesk, Stefan', 'Lairmore, Michael', 'Piwnica-Worms, David', 'Ratner, Lee']","['Rauch D', 'Gross S', 'Harding J', 'Bokhari S', 'Niewiesk S', 'Lairmore M', 'Piwnica-Worms D', 'Ratner L']","['Department of Medicine, Division of Molecular Oncology, Washington University School of Medicine, St Louis, MO 63110, USA. drauch@dom.wustl.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20091217,England,Retrovirology,Retrovirology,101216893,"['0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)']",IM,"['Adaptive Immunity', 'Animals', 'Gene Products, tax/genetics/immunology/metabolism', 'Host-Pathogen Interactions/immunology', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/genetics/immunology', 'Humans', 'Inflammation/*immunology/pathology', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*immunology/metabolism/pathology/virology', '*Lymphocyte Activation', 'Mice', 'NF-kappa B/metabolism', 'Neoplasms, Experimental', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/immunology/metabolism', 'Risk Factors', 'Signal Transduction', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology']",2009/12/19 06:00,2010/03/04 06:00,['2009/12/19 06:00'],"['2009/10/07 00:00 [received]', '2009/12/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/12/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/12/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/03/04 06:00 [medline]']","['1742-4690-6-116 [pii]', '10.1186/1742-4690-6-116 [doi]']",epublish,Retrovirology. 2009 Dec 17;6:116. doi: 10.1186/1742-4690-6-116.,6,"['CA63417/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA10073/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA10521/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA94056/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA100730-07/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA100730/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,PMC2806367,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Our aim was to investigate the role of Notch-signalling in apoptosis regulation in human non-Hodgkin B-cell lymphoma (B-NHL) cell lines and in primary chronic lymhocytic leukaemia (CLL) cells using Delta-like 4 (Dll4) ligand mediated Notch activation and gamma-secretase inhibitor (GSI) mediated Notch inhibition in vitro. The potential cross-talk of Notch with the transforming growth factor-beta (TGFb) pathway in apoptosis induction was also explored, and the effect of GSI on drug-induced apoptosis was assessed. Modulation of Notch-signalling by itself did not change the rate of apoptosis in B-NHL cell lines and in CLL cells. TGFb-induced apoptosis was decreased - but not completely abolished - by GSI in TGFb-sensitive cell lines, but resistance to the apoptotic effects of TGFb were not reversed by Notch activation or inhibition. Drug-induced apoptosis was not modified by GSI. We identified Hairy/Enhancer of Split (HES)-1 as a TGFb target gene in selected - TGFb-sensitive - B-NHL cell lines. TGFb-induced HES-1 was only partially Notch-dependent in later phases. Apoptosis regulation by TGFb and GSI was not dependent on the transcriptional regulation of c-myc. In conclusion, our data does not support a unifying role of Notch in regulating apoptosis in B-NHL, but warns that gamma-secretase inhibitors may actually counteract apoptosis in some cases.","['Hajdu, M', 'Kopper, L', 'Sebestyen, A']","['Hajdu M', 'Kopper L', 'Sebestyen A']","['I.

New insights indicate that this may be attributable to a small population of therapy-resistant malignant cells with self-renewal capacity and the ability to generate large numbers of more differentiated leukemia cells. These leukemia-initiating cells are commonly referred to as Leukemia Stem Cells (LSCs). LSCs are regarded as the root of leukemia origin and leukemia recurrence after seemingly successful therapy. Not surprisingly therefore, contemporary leukemia research has focused on ways to specifically eliminate LSCs, leading to the identification of several promising anti-LSC strategies. Firstly, LSCs may be eliminated by antibody- or ligand-based cell surface delivery of therapeutics such as naked antibodies, immunotoxins, and immunocytokines. This approach exploits LSC-associated surface antigens, such as CD33, CD44, CD96, CD123 and CLL-1 for LSC-selective therapy and aims to spare normal hematopoietic stem cells. A second strategy aims to disrupt the interactions between LSCs and their highly specialized niche. These interactions appear to be pivotal for maintenance of the stem cell-like characteristics of LSCs. A third strategy centers on the selective modulation of aberrantly activated signaling pathways central to LSC biology. A fourth strategy, dubbed 'epigenetic reprogramming', aims to selectively reverse epigenetic alterations that are implicated in ontogeny and maintenance of LSCs. In this review, we will discuss the rationale for these LSCs-targeted strategies and highlight recent advances that may ultimately help pave the way towards selective LSCs-elimination.","['ten Cate, B', 'de Bruyn, M', 'Wei, Y', 'Bremer, E', 'Helfrich, W']","['ten Cate B', 'de Bruyn M', 'Wei Y', 'Bremer E', 'Helfrich W']","['Department of Surgery, University Medical Center Groningen, University of Groningen, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",,United Arab Emirates,Curr Drug Targets,Current drug targets,100960531,,IM,"['Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/drug therapy/*pathology/*therapy', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*drug effects/immunology', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Stem Cell Niche/drug effects']",2009/12/19 06:00,2010/03/17 06:00,['2009/12/19 06:00'],"['2009/05/19 00:00 [received]', '2009/08/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/12/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/12/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/03/17 06:00 [medline]']","['CDT-ms44 [pii]', '10.2174/138945010790031063 [doi]']",ppublish,Curr Drug Targets. 2010 Jan;11(1):95-110. doi: 10.2174/138945010790031063.,11,,,,,152,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As a consequence it became the gold standard first-line treatment for most patients. However, after almost a decade of its use, it is clear that although very effective, imatinib cannot cure CML as transplantation has already proven so. Furthermore, the new non-myeloablative regimens and the improvements in survival after allogeneic transplant, especially in the field of unrelated transplants, offer this option to a broader population of patients with CML. This adds to the old question of whom to transplant, when and how to proceed with the allograft.

Second-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) (dasatinib, nilotinib) were developed as an alternative for patients that develop resistance or are intolerant to imatinib. Dasatinib is a dual Abl/Src kinase TKI that is structurally unrelated to imatinib and is approved for therapy of all phases of CML in patients who are resistant or intolerant to imatinib. Nilotinib is a compound related to imatinib that has greater specificity and improved binding characteristics, and has clinical activity in the setting of imatinib failure.

We conducted an adaptively randomized study of a combination of azacitidine, a hypomethylating agent, and cytarabine in 34 patients with AML. The combination administered in a concomitant fashion is safe at full doses of azacitidine and cytarabine, without unexpected toxicities. However, in this advanced AML population, it was difficult to deliver more than one cycle of therapy, and minimal anti-leukemia activity was seen in patients with relapsed/refractory disease.

However, these devices depend on a monolayer of selectin protein, which has been shown to have a maximum binding efficiency as a function of surface area. A novel surface coating of colloidal silica nanoparticles was designed that alters the surface roughness resulting in increased surface area. The nanoparticles were adhered using either an inorganic titanate resinous coating or an organic polymer of poly-L-lysine. Using Alexa Fluor 647 conjugated P-selectin, an increase in protein adsorption of up to 35% when compared to control was observed. During perfusion experiments using P-selectin-coated microtubes, we observed increased cell capture and greatly decreased rolling velocity at equivalent protein concentration compared to nonparticle control. Atomic force microscopy showed increased surface roughness consistent with the nanoparticle mean diameter, suggesting a monolayer of particles. These results support the coating's potential to improve existing cell capture implantable devices for a variety of therapeutic and scientific uses.","['Han, Woojin', 'Allio, Bryce A', 'Foster, David G', 'King, Michael R']","['Han W', 'Allio BA', 'Foster DG', 'King MR']","['Department of Biomedical Engineering, University of Rochester, Rochester, New York 14627, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,ACS Nano,ACS nano,101313589,"['0 (Adhesives)', '0 (Colloids)', '0 (P-Selectin)', '25104-18-1 (Polylysine)', '7631-86-9 (Silicon Dioxide)', 'D1JT611TNE (Titanium)']",IM,"['Adhesives/chemistry', 'Adsorption', 'Animals', 'Cattle', 'Cell Count', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Separation/instrumentation/*methods', 'Colloids', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Humans', 'Microchemistry/*instrumentation', 'Microscopy, Atomic Force', 'Microscopy, Fluorescence', 'Nanoparticles/*chemistry', 'P-Selectin/chemistry/metabolism', 'Polylysine/chemistry', 'Silicon Dioxide/chemistry', 'Surface Properties', 'Titanium/chemistry']",2009/12/19 06:00,2010/03/27 06:00,['2009/12/19 06:00'],"['2009/12/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/12/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/03/27 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1021/nn900442c [doi]'],ppublish,ACS Nano. 2010 Jan 26;4(1):174-80. doi: 10.1021/nn900442c.,4,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: The bone marrow samples from 53 children with AL and peripheral blood samples from 115 healthy children were obtained to prepare complementary DNAs (cDNAs). The cDNAs were analyzed for the polymorphisms in the TPMT gene by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) and DNA sequencing. The distribution of each genotype was evaluated. RESULTS: Two novel heterozygote mutations, 210C>T (C70C, silent) and 622T>C (F208L), were identified in the coding region of the TPMT in a single sample, respectively. The mother of the child with mutation 622T>C was confirmed as the same genotype by DGGE and sequencing (NCBI_ss accession numbers 107796292 and 107795933).

METHODS: The recombinant eukaryotic expression plasmid containing YB-1 short hairpin RNA (shRNA) or random-sequence (HK) were transfected into K562/A02 cells by lipofectamine mediation. cDNA microarray was performed to explore the alteration of gene expression profile when YB-1 gene expression was decreased. Expression of CARD8 and RHOC genes were verified by semi-quantitative reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR). The proliferative ability of the cells was determined by methyl thiazolyltetrazolium (MTT) assay and cell cycle analysis. Cell apoptosis was assayed by Annexin V-FITC/PI double labeled flow cytometry. RESULTS: The levels of YB-1 mRNA and protein decreased dramatically in three positively transfected cells when compared with untransfected K562/A02 cells or K562/A02-HK thansfected cells. Gene expression profile was altered by transfection of YB-1 shRNA into K562/A02 cells. Among 47,000 genes on the microarray, 252 genes were detected to have changes, with 143 down-regulated and 109 up-regulated. They were functionally related to cell cycle progression, gene replication, metabolism, cell apoptosis, cell signal transduction, etc. An increase in CARD8 gene expression and a decrease in RHOC gene expression have been confirmed by RT-PCR in K562/A02-YBX13 cells. The introduction of exogenous YB-1 shRNA gene into K562/A02 cells resulted in decreased proliferation, higher G1, lower G2 and S ratio in cell cycle distribution in comparison with the control groups. Annexin V/PI detection indicated higher Annexin V+ ratio in the three positively transfected cells 24 hours after cells were treated with 0.5 micromol/L of As2O3. CONCLUSION: Down-regulation of YB-1 gene by shRNA-YB-1 can alter the gene expression profile in K562/A02 cells, leading to change of cell proliferation and apoptosis.","['Xu, Wen-lin', 'Zhou, Lei-lei', 'Chen, Qiao-yun', 'Chen, Chen', 'Fang, Li-li', 'Fang, Xin-jian', 'Shen, Hui-ling']","['Xu WL', 'Zhou LL', 'Chen QY', 'Chen C', 'Fang LL', 'Fang XJ', 'Shen HL']","[""Department of Hematology, the Affiliated People's Hospital, Jiangsu University, Zhenjiang, Jiangsu, 212002 P.R.

Topotecan was evaluated against the Pediatric Preclinical Testing Program (PPTP) tumor panels as part of a validation process for these preclinical models. PROCEDURES: In vivo three measures of antitumor activity were used: (1) an objective response measure modeled after the clinical setting; (2) a treated to control (T/C) tumor volume measure; and (3) a time to event (fourfold increase in tumor volume for solid tumor models, or > or =25% human CD45+ cells in the peripheral blood for acute lymphoblastic leukemia, ALL models) measure based on the median event-free survival (EFS) of treated and control animals for each xenograft. RESULTS: Topotecan inhibited cell growth in vitro with IC(50) values between 0.71 and 489 nM. Topotecan significantly increased EFS in 32 of 37 (87%) solid tumor xenografts and in all 8 of the ALL xenografts. Seventy-five percent of solid tumors met EFS T/C activity criteria for intermediate (n = 17) or high activity (n = 7). Objective responses were noted in eight solid tumor xenografts (Wilms, rhabdomyosarcoma, Ewing sarcoma, neuroblastoma). Among the six neuroblastomas, three achieved a PR. For the ALL panel, two maintained CRs, three CRs, and two PRs were observed. CONCLUSIONS: Topotecan demonstrated broad activity in vitro and in vivo against both the solid tumor and ALL panels, with significant tumor growth delay generated in all the panels. These results further demonstrate the validity of the PPTP panel for preclinical testing of new drugs.","['Carol, Hernan', 'Houghton, Peter J', 'Morton, Christopher L', 'Kolb, E Anders', 'Gorlick, Richard', 'Reynolds, C Patrick', 'Kang, Min H', 'Maris, John M', 'Keir, Stephen T', 'Watkins, Amy', 'Smith, Malcolm A', 'Lock, Richard B']","['Carol H', 'Houghton PJ', 'Morton CL', 'Kolb EA', 'Gorlick R', 'Reynolds CP', 'Kang MH', 'Maris JM', 'Keir ST', 'Watkins A', 'Smith MA', 'Lock RB']","[""Children's Cancer Institute Australia for Medical Research, Randwick, NSW, Australia.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', 'Validation Study']",,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '7M7YKX2N15 (Topotecan)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Child', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', '*Drug Evaluation, Preclinical', 'Humans', 'Models, Theoretical', 'Neoplasms/*drug therapy', 'Topotecan/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",2009/12/18 06:00,2010/04/08 06:00,['2009/12/18 06:00'],"['2009/12/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/12/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/04/08 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/pbc.22352 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2010 May;54(5):707-15. doi: 10.1002/pbc.22352.,54,"['P50 CA108786/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA108786/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'N01CM42216/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA21765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'N01 CM042216/CM/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA021765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'N01-CM-42216/CM/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",['Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2010 Aug;55(2):393.

MicroRNA (miRNA), a novel class of RNA that regulates gene expression, is involved in many cellular processes such as growth, development and apoptosis. It has recently been linked to several cancer phenotypes. However, aberrant miRNA expression and its pathologic significance in ATL are not well documented. Here, we investigated the role of miRNAs in HTLV-1-related leukemogenesis. The results showed that miR-146a was upregulated in HTLV-1-infected T-cell lines compared to uninfected T-cell lines. Tax-induced miR-146a expression in a NF-kappaB-dependent manner and inhibited the expression of gene harboring the target sequence of miR-146a on its 3'UTR. Inhibition of miR-146a function by anti-miRNA inhibitor reduced the proliferation of HTLV-1-infected T-cell lines but not that of uninfected T-cell lines. Moreover, overexpression of miR-146a enhanced the growth of an HTLV-1-infected T-cell line. Our findings suggest that miR-146a is a potentially suitable therapeutic target of ATL.","['Tomita, Mariko', 'Tanaka, Yuetsu', 'Mori, Naoki']","['Tomita M', 'Tanaka Y', 'Mori N']","['University of the Ryukyus, Nishihara, Okinawa, Japan. mtomita@med.u-ryukyu.ac.jp']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20091216,United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,"['0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (MIRN146 microRNA, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (NF-kappa B)']",IM,"['Apoptosis', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Gene Products, tax/*physiology', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*genetics/virology', 'MicroRNAs/*genetics/metabolism/physiology', 'NF-kappa B/metabolism', 'T-Lymphocytes/metabolism/pathology/*virology', 'Transcriptional Activation']",2009/12/18 06:00,2012/05/05 06:00,['2009/12/18 06:00'],"['2009/07/31 00:00 [received]', '2009/12/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/12/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/12/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/05/05 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/ijc.25115 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Cancer. 2012 May 15;130(10):2300-9. doi: 10.1002/ijc.25115.

We examined whether single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of the PBX1 gene are associated with overweight/obesity in a Korean population. We genotyped 66 SNPs in the PBX1 gene and investigated their association with clinical phenotypes found in 214 overweight/obese subjects and 160 control subjects using the Affymetrix Targeted Genotyping chip array. Seven SNPs (g.+75186C>T, g.+78350C>A, g.+80646C>T, g.+138004C>T, g.+185219G>A, g.+191272A>C, and g.+265317T>A) were associated with the risk of obesity in three models (codominant, dominant, and recessive) (P=0.007-0.05). Haplotype 1 (CAC) and 3 (TAC) of block 3 and haplotype 2 (GGAAT) of block 10 were also strongly associated with the risk of obesity. In the control group, subjects that had homozygote for the major allele for both g.+185219G>A and g.+191272A>C showed lower high density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-C) level compared to those possessing the minor allele, suggesting that the association between the homozygote for the major allele for both g.+185219G>A and g.+191272A>C and HDL-C is attributable to the increased risk of obesity. This study suggests that the PBX1 gene is a possible risk factor in overweight/obese patients.","['Ban, Ju Yeon', 'Kang, Soon Ah', 'Jung, Kyung Hee', 'Kim, Hak Jae', 'Uhm, Yoon Kyung', 'Kim, Su Kang', 'Yim, Sung-Vin', 'Choe, Bong-Keun', 'Hong, Seung-Jae', 'Seong, Yeon Hee', 'Koh, In Song', 'Chung, Joo-Ho']","['Ban JY', 'Kang SA', 'Jung KH', 'Kim HJ', 'Uhm YK', 'Kim SK', 'Yim SV', 'Choe BK', 'Hong SJ', 'Seong YH', 'Koh IS', 'Chung JH']","['Brain Korea 21 Project Center, Kyung Hee University, Hoegi-dong, Dongdaemun-gu, Seoul 130-701, Korea.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20081231,Korea (South),Nutr Res Pract,Nutrition research and practice,101311052,,,,2008/01/01 00:00,2008/01/01 00:01,['2009/12/18 06:00'],"['2008/09/01 00:00 [received]', '2008/10/22 00:00 [revised]', '2008/11/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/12/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2008/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2008/01/01 00:01 [medline]']",['10.4162/nrp.2008.2.4.289 [doi]'],ppublish,Nutr Res Pract. 2008 Winter;2(4):289-94. doi: 10.4162/nrp.2008.2.4.289.

All patients received risk-adopted therapy according to leukocyte count and age at the time of diagnosis. The median follow-up durations of the four studies were 17.8 years in ALL811, 15.5 years in ALL841, 11.9 years in ALL874 and 15.8 years in ALL911. Patients' event-free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS) rates at 12 years were 41.0 and 54.3% in ALL811, 50.2 and 60.2% in ALL841, 57.3 and 64.7% in ALL874, and 63.4 and 71.7% in ALL911, respectively. Thus, cure can become a reality for about 70% of children with ALL. There is, however, still a significant difference in survival outcomes according to risk group. Late effects were observed in 70 patients out of 834 (8.4%); hepatitis and short stature were most commonly reported. Reduction of late adverse effects for all patients and development of new treatment strategies for very-high-risk patients are major issues for upcoming trials to address.","['Tsurusawa, M', 'Shimomura, Y', 'Asami, K', 'Kikuta, A', 'Watanabe, A', 'Horikoshi, Y', 'Matsushita, T', 'Kanegane, H', 'Ohta, S', 'Iwai, A', 'Mugishima, H', 'Koizumi, S']","['Tsurusawa M', 'Shimomura Y', 'Asami K', 'Kikuta A', 'Watanabe A', 'Horikoshi Y', 'Matsushita T', 'Kanegane H', 'Ohta S', 'Iwai A', 'Mugishima H', 'Koizumi S']","['Department of Pediatrics, Aichi Medical University, Aichi, Japan. mtsuru@aichi-med-u.ac.jp']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article']",20091217,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Japan', 'Male', 'Medical Oncology/organization & administration', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/diagnosis/*drug therapy', 'Prognosis', 'Remission Induction', 'Risk Factors', 'Survival Rate', 'Time Factors', 'Treatment Outcome']",2009/12/18 06:00,2010/03/12 06:00,['2009/12/18 06:00'],"['2009/12/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/12/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/03/12 06:00 [medline]']","['leu2009259 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2009.259 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2010 Feb;24(2):335-44. doi: 10.1038/leu.2009.259.

The event-free survival improved significantly (P=0.0004) over this period, 69.3+/-1.9% in 1997-2001 to 77.4+/-1.7% in 2002-2007. A randomized trial in TPOG-97 testing L-asparaginase versus epidoxorubicin in combination with vincristine and prednisolone for remission induction in standard-risk (SR; low-risk) patients yielded similar outcomes. Another randomized trial, in TPOG-2002, showed that for SR patients, two reinduction courses did not improve long-term outcome over one course. Decreasing use of prophylactic cranial irradiation in the period 1997-2008 was not associated with increased rates of CNS relapse, prompting complete omission of prophylactic cranial irradiation from TPOG protocols, beginning in 2009. Decreased use of etoposide and cranial irradiation likely contributed to the low incidence of second cancers. High-risk B-lineage ALL, T-cell, CD10 negativity, t(9;22), infant, and higher leukocyte count were consistently adverse factors, whereas hyperdiploidy >50 was a consistently favorable factor. Higher leukocyte count and t(9;22) retained prognostic significance in both TPOG-97 and TPOG-2002 by multivariate analysis. Although long-term outcome in TPOG clinical trials is comparable with results being reported worldwide, the persistent strength of certain prognostic variables and the lower frequencies of favorable outcome predictors, such as ETV6-RUNX1 and hyperdiploidy >50, in Taiwanese children warrant renewed effort to cure a higher proportion of patients while preserving their quality of life.","['Liang, D-C', 'Yang, C-P', 'Lin, D-T', 'Hung, I-J', 'Lin, K-H', 'Chen, J-S', 'Hsiao, C-C', 'Chang, T-T', 'Peng, C-T', 'Lin, M-T', 'Chang, T-K', 'Jaing, T-H', 'Liu, H-C', 'Wang, L-Y', 'Yeh, T-C', 'Jou, S-T', 'Lu, M-Y', 'Cheng, C-N', 'Sheen, J-M', 'Chiou, S-S', 'Wu, K-H', 'Hung, G-Y', 'Chen, R-L', 'Chen, S-H', 'Cheng, S-N', 'Chang, Y-H', 'Chen, B-W', 'Ho, W-L', 'Wang, J-L', 'Lin, S-T', 'Hsieh, Y-L', 'Wang, S-C', 'Chang, H-H', 'Yang, Y-L', 'Huang, F-L', 'Chang, C-Y', 'Chang, W-H', 'Lin, K-S']","['Liang DC', 'Yang CP', 'Lin DT', 'Hung IJ', 'Lin KH', 'Chen JS', 'Hsiao CC', 'Chang TT', 'Peng CT', 'Lin MT', 'Chang TK', 'Jaing TH', 'Liu HC', 'Wang LY', 'Yeh TC', 'Jou ST', 'Lu MY', 'Cheng CN', 'Sheen JM', 'Chiou SS', 'Wu KH', 'Hung GY', 'Chen RL', 'Chen SH', 'Cheng SN', 'Chang YH', 'Chen BW', 'Ho WL', 'Wang JL', 'Lin ST', 'Hsieh YL', 'Wang SC', 'Chang HH', 'Yang YL', 'Huang FL', 'Chang CY', 'Chang WH', 'Lin KS']","['Department of Pediatrics, Mackay Memorial Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan, ROC.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20091217,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Cranial Irradiation', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local/genetics/pathology/*therapy', 'Neoplasm, Residual', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/genetics/pathology/*therapy', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics/pathology/*therapy', 'Prognosis', 'Remission Induction', 'Risk Factors', 'Survival Rate', 'Taiwan', 'Time Factors', 'Treatment Outcome']",2009/12/18 06:00,2010/03/12 06:00,['2009/12/18 06:00'],"['2009/12/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/12/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/03/12 06:00 [medline]']","['leu2009248 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2009.248 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2010 Feb;24(2):397-405. doi: 10.1038/leu.2009.248.

The treatment backbone has included 20-30 consecutive weeks of asparaginase during intensification and frequent vincristine/corticosteroid pulses during the continuation phase. Between 1985 and 2000, 1457 children aged 0-18 years were treated on four consecutive protocols: 85-01 (1985-1987), 87-01 (1987-1991), 91-01 (1991-1955) and 95-01 (1996-2000).

Approximately 82% of patients treated in the 1980s and 88% treated in the 1990s were long-term survivors. Both EFS and overall survival (OS) rates were significantly higher for patients treated in the 1990s compared with the 1980s (P=0.05 and 0.01, respectively). On the two protocols conducted in the 1990s, EFS was 79-85% for T-cell ALL patients and 75-78% for adolescents (age 10-18 years). Results of randomized studies revealed that dexrazoxane prevented acute cardiac injury without adversely affecting EFS or OS in high-risk (HR) patients, and frequently dosed intrathecal chemotherapy was an effective substitute for cranial radiation in standard-risk (SR) patients.

As acute myeloid leukemia (AML) represents a genetically heterogeneous disease, this technology might prove helpful, especially for cytogenetically normal AML (CN-AML) cases. Thus, we performed high-resolution SNP analyses in 157 adult cases of CN-AML. Regions of acquired UPDs were identified in 12% of cases and in the most frequently affected chromosomes, 6p, 11p and 13q. Notably, acquired UPD was invariably associated with mutations in nucleophosmin 1 (NPM1) or CCAAT/enhancer binding protein-alpha (CEBPA) that impair hematopoietic differentiation (P=0.008), suggesting that UPDs may preferentially target genes that are essential for proliferation and survival of hematopoietic progenitors. Acquired copy number alterations (CNAs) were detected in 49% of cases with losses found in two or more cases affecting, for example, chromosome bands 3p13-p14.1 and 12p13. Furthermore, we identified two cases with a cryptic t(6;11) as well as several non-recurrent aberrations pointing to leukemia-relevant regions. With regard to clinical outcome, there seemed to be an association between UPD 11p and UPD 13q cases with overall survival.

Five-year EFS for infants was 36, 38, and 43%, respectively. Seminal randomized studies led to a number of important findings. Stronger post-induction intensification improved outcome for both SR and HR patients. With improved systemic therapy, additional intrathecal (IT) methotrexate effectively replaced cranial radiation. For SR patients receiving three-drug induction, iso-toxic substitution of dexamethasone for prednisone improved EFS. Pegylated asparaginase safely and effectively replaced native asparaginase. Thus, rational therapy modifications yielded better outcomes for both SR and HR patients. These trials provide the platforms for current Children's Oncology Group trials.","['Gaynon, P S', 'Angiolillo, A L', 'Carroll, W L', 'Nachman, J B', 'Trigg, M E', 'Sather, H N', 'Hunger, S P', 'Devidas, M']","['Gaynon PS', 'Angiolillo AL', 'Carroll WL', 'Nachman JB', 'Trigg ME', 'Sather HN', 'Hunger SP', 'Devidas M']","['Childrens Center for Cancer and Blood Diseases, Childrens Hospital Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA 90027, USA. pgaynon@chla.usc.edu']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20091217,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,,IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Combined Modality Therapy', '*Cranial Irradiation', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local/mortality/pathology/*therapy', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/mortality/pathology/*therapy', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/mortality/pathology/*therapy', 'Prognosis', 'Remission Induction', 'Risk Factors', 'Survival Rate', 'Time Factors', 'Treatment Outcome']",2009/12/18 06:00,2010/03/12 06:00,['2009/12/18 06:00'],"['2009/12/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/12/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/03/12 06:00 [medline]']","['leu2009262 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2009.262 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2010 Feb;24(2):285-97. doi: 10.1038/leu.2009.262.

The probability of event-free survival (pEFS) improved significantly from the first two trials conducted in the 1980s (COALL 82 and COALL 85) to the three trials conducted in the 1990s (COALL 89, 92 and 97) (P=0.001). Through all COALL studies, age > or =10 years and initial white blood cell count (WBC) > or =50 x 10(9)/l and pro-B immunophenotype were of significant prognostic relevance. A refinement of risk assessment has been achieved by in vitro drug sensitivity testing in COALL 92 and 97. In patients with very sensitive leukaemic cells, therapy could be reduced without loss of efficacy. In COALL 97, a further improvement in risk stratification was gained by the molecular assessment of minimal residual disease (MRD) under treatment, which proved to have a superior prognostic effect when compared with in vitro drug sensitivity testing. Importantly, the gradual reduction in central nervous system (CNS) irradiation led to a decreased incidence of brain tumours as a second malignancy. In general, the prevention of treatment-related late effects will be one of the major issues in future studies. It remains to be shown whether prolonged infusions of anthracyclines, which have been implemented into the COALL studies after equal efficacy compared with short-time infusions was confirmed, will be associated with fewer cardiac late effects. Another way to prevent late effects may be a more refined risk assessment allowing for a reduction in cumulative treatment burden. A great challenge in the future will be to improve the overall treatment results, which very likely can only be achieved by the identification of molecularly defined subgroups to which novel, rational therapeutic strategies can be applied.","['Escherich, G', 'Horstmann, M A', 'Zimmermann, M', 'Janka-Schaub, G E']","['Escherich G', 'Horstmann MA', 'Zimmermann M', 'Janka-Schaub GE']","['Clinic of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany. escherich@uke.uni-hamburg.de or']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20091217,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Combined Modality Therapy', '*Cranial Irradiation', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Infant', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Male', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local/diagnosis/*therapy', 'Neoplasm, Residual/diagnosis/*therapy', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/diagnosis/*therapy', 'Prognosis', 'Remission Induction', 'Risk Factors', 'Survival Rate', 'Time Factors', 'Treatment Outcome']",2009/12/18 06:00,2010/03/12 06:00,['2009/12/18 06:00'],"['2009/12/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/12/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/03/12 06:00 [medline]']","['leu2009249 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2009.249 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2010 Feb;24(2):298-308. doi: 10.1038/leu.2009.249.

To better understand this phenomenon, we have analysed the changes in incidence and pattern of CNS relapses in 5564 children enrolled in four successive Medical Research Council-ALL trials between 1985 and 2001. Changes in the incidence and pattern of CNS relapses were examined and the relationship with patient characteristics was assessed. The factors affecting outcome after relapse were determined. Overall, relapses declined by 49%. Decreases occurred primarily in non-CNS and combined relapses with a progressive shift towards later (> or =30 months from diagnosis) relapses (P<0.0001). Although isolated CNS relapses declined, the proportional incidence and timing of relapse remained unchanged. Age and presenting white blood cell (WBC) count were risk factors for CNS relapse. On multivariate analysis, the time to relapse and the trial period influenced outcomes after relapse. Relapse trends differed within biological subtypes. In ETV6-RUNX1 ALL, relapse patterns mirrored overall trends whereas in high hyperdiploidy (HH) ALL, these seem to have plateaued over the latter two trial periods. Intensive systemic and intrathecal chemotherapy have decreased the overall CNS relapse rates and changed the patterns of recurrence. The heterogeneity of therapeutic response in the biological subtypes suggests room for further optimization using currently available chemotherapy.","['Krishnan, S', 'Wade, R', 'Moorman, A V', 'Mitchell, C', 'Kinsey, S E', 'Eden, T O B', 'Parker, C', 'Vora, A', 'Richards, S', 'Saha, V']","['Krishnan S', 'Wade R', 'Moorman AV', 'Mitchell C', 'Kinsey SE', 'Eden TO', 'Parker C', 'Vora A', 'Richards S', 'Saha V']","[""Cancer Research UK Children's Cancer Group, Paterson Institute for Cancer Research, University of Manchester, Manchester, UK.""]",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20091217,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,,IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Brain Neoplasms/*epidemiology/therapy', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Cranial Irradiation', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Incidence', 'Infant', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Male', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local/*epidemiology/therapy', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*epidemiology/therapy', 'Prognosis', 'Remission Induction', 'Risk Factors', 'Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Survival Rate', 'Treatment Outcome', 'United Kingdom']",2009/12/18 06:00,2010/03/12 06:00,['2009/12/18 06:00'],"['2009/12/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/12/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/03/12 06:00 [medline]']","['leu2009264 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2009.264 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2010 Feb;24(2):450-9. doi: 10.1038/leu.2009.264.

In four successive protocols, 1734 children were treated. Studies ALL-6 and ALL-9 followed the Total Therapy approach; cranial irradiation was replaced by medium-dose methotrexate infusions and prolonged triple intrathecal therapy; dexamethasone was used instead of prednisone. Studies ALL-7 and ALL-8 had a BFM backbone, including more intensive remission induction, early reinduction and maintenance therapy without vincristine and prednisone pulses. The 5-year event-free survival and overall survival increased from 65.4 to 80.6% (P<0.001) and from 78.7 to 86.4% (P=0.07) in ALL-7 and ALL-9, respectively. In ALL-7 and ALL-8 National Cancer Institute (NCI) high-risk criteria, male gender, T-lineage ALL and high white blood cells (WBCs) predict poor outcome. In ALL-9 NCI criteria, gender, WBC >100 x 109/l, and T-lineage ALL have prognostic impact. We conclude that the chemotherapy-only approach in children with ALL in Total Therapy-based strategies and BFM-backbone treatment does not jeopardize survival and preserves cognitive functioning. This experience is implemented in the current DCOG-ALL-10 study using a BFM backbone and minimal residual disease-based stratification.","['Kamps, W A', 'van der Pal-de Bruin, K M', 'Veerman, A J P', 'Fiocco, M', 'Bierings, M', 'Pieters, R']","['Kamps WA', 'van der Pal-de Bruin KM', 'Veerman AJ', 'Fiocco M', 'Bierings M', 'Pieters R']","['Dutch Childhood Oncology Group, The Hague, The Netherlands. w.a.kamps@bkk.umcg.nl']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article']",20091217,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Medical Oncology/organization & administration', 'Neoplasm, Residual', 'Netherlands', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Prognosis', 'Remission Induction', 'Risk Factors', 'Survival Rate', 'Time Factors', 'Treatment Outcome']",2009/12/18 06:00,2010/03/12 06:00,['2009/12/18 06:00'],"['2009/12/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/12/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/03/12 06:00 [medline]']","['leu2009258 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2009.258 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2010 Feb;24(2):309-19. doi: 10.1038/leu.2009.258.

As such, it plays an important role in development, homeostasis, angiogenesis and various diseases. Over-activation of the Notch pathway has often been reported in cancer, leading to a variety of effects including increased proliferation, protection from apoptosis and maintenance of cancer initiating cells. Additionally, this signalling pathway has also been involved in tumor angiogenesis. The clearest example of oncogenic Notch signalling is observed in T acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL), an aggressive neoplasm of immature T-cells, due to genetic alterations leading to ligand-independent increased Notch1 receptor signalling. In solid tumors, however, extrinsic regulation through canonical cell-cell interactions appears to drive activation of the pathway. We recently found that triggering of Notch3 signalling by DLL4 expressed on angiogenic endothelial cells promotes escape of T-ALL cells from tumor dormancy in a xenograft model. This observation discloses un unsuspected role for ligand-dependent regulation of Notch receptors in T-ALL cells, suggesting that blocking extrinsic Notch activation by anti-DLL4 or other ligand-targeted drugs could represent a novel therapeutic approach for this aggressive malignancy.","['Indraccolo, Stefano', 'Minuzzo, Sonia', 'Masiero, Massimo', 'Amadori, Alberto']","['Indraccolo S', 'Minuzzo S', 'Masiero M', 'Amadori A']","['Istituto Oncologico Veneto-IRCCS, Padova, Italy. stefano.indraccolo@unipd.it']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Cell Cycle,"Cell cycle (Georgetown, Tex.)",101137841,"['0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Notch)', '0 (delta protein)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Humans', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins', 'Leukemia/metabolism', 'Membrane Proteins/metabolism', 'Models, Biological', 'Neovascularization, Pathologic/metabolism', 'Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Notch/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/genetics/physiology']",2009/12/18 06:00,2010/03/10 06:00,['2009/12/18 06:00'],"['2009/12/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/12/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/03/10 06:00 [medline]']","['10346 [pii]', '10.4161/cc.9.1.10346 [doi]']",ppublish,Cell Cycle. 2010 Jan 1;9(1):80-5. doi: 10.4161/cc.9.1.10346.,9,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the neural pathways underlying this effect are not well understood. We demonstrate that LIF acutely inhibits food intake by directly activating pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) neurons in the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus. We show that arcuate POMC neurons express the LIF-R, and that LIF stimulates the release of the anorexigenic peptide, alpha-MSH from ex vivo hypothalami. Transgenic mice lacking gp130, the signal transducing subunit of the LIF-R complex, specifically in POMC neurons fail to respond to LIF. Furthermore, LIF does not stimulate the release of alpha-MSH from the transgenic hypothalamic explants. These findings indicate that POMC neurons mediate the acute anorectic actions of central LIF administration and provide a mechanistic link between inflammation and food intake.","['Grossberg, Aaron J', 'Scarlett, Jarrad M', 'Zhu, XinXia', 'Bowe, Darren D', 'Batra, Ayesha K', 'Braun, Theodore P', 'Marks, Daniel L']","['Grossberg AJ', 'Scarlett JM', 'Zhu X', 'Bowe DD', 'Batra AK', 'Braun TP', 'Marks DL']","['Department of Pediatrics, Oregon Health and Science University, Mail Code L-481, Portland, Oregon 97239, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20091216,United States,Endocrinology,Endocrinology,0375040,"['0 (Ciliary Neurotrophic Factor)', '0 (Interleukin-1beta)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lipopolysaccharides)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '133483-10-0 (Cytokine Receptor gp130)', '581-05-5 (alpha-MSH)', '66796-54-1 (Pro-Opiomelanocortin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Anorexia/genetics/*physiopathology', 'Arcuate Nucleus of Hypothalamus/*physiology', 'Ciliary Neurotrophic Factor/*genetics', 'Cytokine Receptor gp130/*physiology', 'Genes, Reporter', 'Genotype', 'Interleukin-1beta/pharmacology', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/pharmacology', 'Lipopolysaccharides/pharmacology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Neurons/drug effects/*physiology', 'Pro-Opiomelanocortin/*physiology', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Rats', 'Rats, Sprague-Dawley', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'alpha-MSH/physiology']",2009/12/18 06:00,2010/02/27 06:00,['2009/12/18 06:00'],"['2009/12/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/12/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/02/27 06:00 [medline]']","['en.2009-1135 [pii]', '10.1210/en.2009-1135 [doi]']",ppublish,Endocrinology. 2010 Feb;151(2):606-16. doi: 10.1210/en.2009-1135.

This implies a potential role for Mkls in linking synaptic activity, through gene-expression control, to neuronal structural plasticity. Here, we present evidence that Mkls, particularly Mkl2, are powerful regulators of neuronal structure in vitro. Moreover, using the passive avoidance-conditioning paradigm, we identify learning-associated alterations of neuronal Mkl expression that appear to contribute to 2 phases of gene regulation during memory consolidation in the hippocampus. Gene regulation immediately after learning includes Egr2 and may be facilitated by downregulation of Mkls likely releasing ternary complex factor-regulated SRF activity. The second transcriptional phase occurs later at the 3-h postavoidance time point when Mkl accumulates in the nucleus of hippocampal neurons and there is enhanced transcription of Mkl-dependent structural genes that may contribute to the elaboration of new, memory-associated synapses known to appear over the subsequent 3-h period.","[""O'Sullivan, Niamh C"", 'Pickering, Mark', 'Di Giacomo, Danika', 'Loscher, Jennifer S', 'Murphy, Keith J']","[""O'Sullivan NC"", 'Pickering M', 'Di Giacomo D', 'Loscher JS', 'Murphy KJ']","['Applied Neurotherapeutics Research Group, UCD Schools of Biomolecular and Biomedical Science, UCD Conway Institute, University College Dublin, Dublin, Ireland. ruthger.righart@unige.ch']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20091216,United States,Cereb Cortex,"Cerebral cortex (New York, N.Y. : 1991)",9110718,"['0 (Early Growth Response Protein 2)', '0 (Egr2 protein, rat)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (Kif11 protein, rat)', 'EC 3.6.4.4 (Kinesins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Avoidance Learning/physiology', 'Cell Differentiation/physiology', 'Early Growth Response Protein 2/genetics/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental/genetics', 'Hippocampus/cytology/*metabolism', 'Kinesins/*physiology', 'Male', 'Memory/physiology', 'Neuronal Plasticity/genetics/*physiology', 'Neurons/cytology/*metabolism', 'Protein Transport/genetics', 'Rats', 'Rats, Wistar', 'Synaptic Transmission/genetics', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/*physiology']",2009/12/18 06:00,2011/02/22 06:00,['2009/12/18 06:00'],"['2009/12/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/12/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/02/22 06:00 [medline]']","['bhp262 [pii]', '10.1093/cercor/bhp262 [doi]']",ppublish,Cereb Cortex. 2010 Aug;20(8):1915-25. doi: 10.1093/cercor/bhp262.

XMRV was first identified in prostate stromal cells surrounding the tumors of patients carrying a mutation in the HPC1 gene locus. To determine the tropism of XMRV in cell culture, we tested the ability of XMRV to spread and replicate in various prostate and nonprostate cell lines. We found that although the expression of XMRV viral proteins and the spread of infectious virus were minimal in a variety of cell lines, XMRV displayed robust expression and infection in LNCaP prostate tumor cells. The transcriptional activity of the XMRV long terminal repeat (LTR) was found to be higher than the Moloney murine leukemia virus LTRs in both LNCaP and WPMY-1 (simian virus 40-transformed prostate stromal cells). The U3 promoter of XMRV and a glucocorticoid response element (GRE) within the U3 were required for the transcriptional activity in LNCaP cells. Coexpression of the androgen receptor and stimulation with dihydrotestosterone stimulated XMRV-LTR-dependent transcription in 293T cells, and the GRE was required for this activity. These data suggest that XMRV may replicate more efficiently in LNCaP cells in part due to the transcriptional environment in LNCaP cells.","['Rodriguez, Jason J', 'Goff, Stephen P']","['Rodriguez JJ', 'Goff SP']","['Columbia University, Howard Hughes Medical Institute, HHSC 1310c, New York, New York 10032, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20091216,United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line, Tumor', '*Gammaretrovirus/genetics/metabolism/pathogenicity', 'Genes, Reporter', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/genetics/metabolism', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', '*Prostate/cytology/pathology/virology', 'Prostatic Neoplasms/genetics/*metabolism/pathology/*virology', '*Transcription, Genetic', 'Virus Internalization', 'Virus Replication/*physiology']",2009/12/18 06:00,2010/03/18 06:00,['2009/12/18 06:00'],"['2009/12/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/12/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/03/18 06:00 [medline]']","['JVI.01969-09 [pii]', '10.1128/JVI.01969-09 [doi]']",ppublish,J Virol. 2010 Mar;84(5):2556-62. doi: 10.1128/JVI.01969-09.

A typical vancomycin pharmacokinetics is observed in such patients. The aim of the study was to evaluate the pharmacokinetics of vancomycin in this patient population and compare it to that of normal population. METHOD AND RESULTS: the pharmacokinetics of vancomycin was examined retrospectively in two groups of patients - 18 cancer patients (age 43.4 +/- 22.1 years) and 13 patients without cancer (age 48.5 +/- 20.2 years). Following the administration of intermittent intravenous infusion of 15 mg/kg of vancomycin, peak and trough vancomycin serum concentration were determined after the third dose or at steady state as per standard of care. Vancomycin data were analyzed according to a one-compartment open model. Pharmacokinetic parameters such as clearance (CL), volume of distribution (Vd), and K elimination (ke) were calculated. Both Vd and CL were significantly higher in the cancer group (Mean Vd was 70 +/- 45 L in the cancer group and 31.1 +/- 8.3 L in the noncancer group, p-value 0.002; CL mean was 110.1 +/- 42 mL/min in the cancer group and 71.2 +/- 22.2 mL/min in the noncancer group, p-value 0.005). There was no significant difference in K elimination and half-life (t(1/2)). CONCLUSION: cancer patients may require higher than usual dosing regimens to ensure optimal therapeutic concentrations, since vancomycin CL and Vd is significantly higher in these patients, a dosing schedule as high as 60 mg/kg/day may be needed for cancer patients.","['Al-Kofide, Hadeel', 'Zaghloul, Iman', 'Al-Naim, Lamya']","['Al-Kofide H', 'Zaghloul I', 'Al-Naim L']","['Department of Clinical Pharmacy, College of Pharmacy, King Saud University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. halkofide@ksu.edu.sa']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20091216,England,J Oncol Pharm Pract,Journal of oncology pharmacy practice : official publication of the International Society of Oncology Pharmacy Practitioners,9511372,"['0 (Anti-Bacterial Agents)', '6Q205EH1VU (Vancomycin)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents/blood/*pharmacokinetics', 'Body Mass Index', 'Drug Monitoring', 'Female', 'Gram-Positive Bacterial Infections/complications/*drug therapy/prevention & control', 'Half-Life', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/complications/drug therapy', 'Male', 'Medical Records', 'Metabolic Clearance Rate', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms/*complications/drug therapy', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Vancomycin/blood/*pharmacokinetics', 'Young Adult']",2009/12/18 06:00,2011/04/06 06:00,['2009/12/18 06:00'],"['2009/12/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/12/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/04/06 06:00 [medline]']","['1078155209355847 [pii]', '10.1177/1078155209355847 [doi]']",ppublish,J Oncol Pharm Pract. 2010 Dec;16(4):245-50. doi: 10.1177/1078155209355847.

One-third of leukemias showed compound-heterozygous NF1-inactivating mutations. A minority of cases exhibited somatic interstitial deletions.

Cases of apparent splenic marginal zone B-cell lymphoma showing CD5 expression, as diagnosed by blood studies, have been described; however, in the absence of histological evidence, the correct diagnosis of these cases is controversial because of possible confusion with other CD5-positive small B-cell neoplasms. DESIGN AND METHODS: We report a series of 24 CD5-positive, t(11;14)-negative cases of splenic marginal zone B-cell lymphoma diagnosed by flow cytometry studies of blood and histologically proven on spleen sections. Clinical data as well as morphological, immunological, cytogenetic and molecular characteristics were assessed to evaluate the similarities and differences of these cases with those of classical CD5-negative splenic marginal zone B-cell lymphoma. RESULTS: The CD5 expression detected in blood by flow cytometry was confirmed in most cases by immunohistochemistry on spleen sections. In general, cases of CD5-positive and CD5-negative splenic marginal zone B-cell lymphoma did not appear different and, in particular, they showed similar karyotypic changes such as 7q deletion, trisomy 3, trisomy 18 and biased IGHV usage (i.e. VH1-2). The main differences were a higher lymphocyte count at diagnosis (8.15x10(9)/L versus 3.90x10(9)/L; P=0.005) and more frequent diffuse bone marrow infiltration (34% versus 8%; P=0.03) in the CD5-positive group. A tendency to a more mutated IGHV status in the CD5 positive cases was observed (80% versus 54.5%; (P=0.11). No significant differences in outcome were found in relation to CD5 expression. CONCLUSIONS: This study confirms the existence of cases of CD5-positive splenic marginal zone B-cell lymphoma and shows that these cases are closely related to classical splenic marginal zone lymphoma. Whether or not CD5-positive splenic marginal zone B-cell lymphoma constitutes a true subset obviously requires the study of more cases.","['Baseggio, Lucile', 'Traverse-Glehen, Alexandra', 'Petinataud, Florence', 'Callet-Bauchu, Evelyne', 'Berger, Francoise', 'Ffrench, Martine', 'Couris, Chantal Marie', 'Thieblemont, Catherine', 'Morel, Dominique', 'Coiffier, Bertrand', 'Salles, Gilles', 'Felman, Pascale']","['Baseggio L', 'Traverse-Glehen A', 'Petinataud F', 'Callet-Bauchu E', 'Berger F', 'Ffrench M', 'Couris CM', 'Thieblemont C', 'Morel D', 'Coiffier B', 'Salles G', 'Felman P']","[""Laboratoire d'Hematologie Cellulaire Centre Hospitalier Lyon Sud, Hospices Civils de Lyon, Lyon.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20091216,Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,"['0 (CD5 Antigens)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'CD5 Antigens/*metabolism', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 11/genetics', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 14/genetics', 'Cytogenetic Analysis', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Immunoenzyme Techniques', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/genetics', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/diagnosis/genetics/metabolism', 'Lymphocytosis/*pathology', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell, Marginal Zone/*diagnosis/genetics/*metabolism', 'Lymphoma, Mantle-Cell/diagnosis/genetics/metabolism', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', 'Splenic Neoplasms/*diagnosis/genetics/*metabolism', 'Translocation, Genetic', 'Waldenstrom Macroglobulinemia/diagnosis/genetics/metabolism']",2009/12/18 06:00,2010/08/25 06:00,['2009/12/18 06:00'],"['2009/12/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/12/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/08/25 06:00 [medline]']","['haematol.2009.011049 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.2009.011049 [doi]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2010 Apr;95(4):604-12. doi: 10.3324/haematol.2009.011049.

DESIGN AND METHODS: Having reported feasibility previously, we hereby report the efficacy of escalated imatinib (200 mg, 400 mg, 600 mg or 800 mg) in combination with two cycles of intravenous cytarabine (200 mg/m(2) or 1000 mg/m(2) days 1 to 7) in 162 patients with chronic myeloid leukemia. RESULTS: With a median follow-up of 55 months, the 5-year cumulative incidences of complete cytogenetic response, major molecular response, and complete molecular response were 89%, 71%, and 53%, respectively. A higher Sokal risk score was inversely associated with complete cytogenetic response (hazard ratio of 0.63; 95% confidence interval, 0.50-0.79, P<0.001). A higher dose of imatinib and a higher dose of cytarabine were associated with increased complete molecular response with hazard ratios of 1.60 (95% confidence interval, 0.96-2.68, P=0.07) and 1.66 (95% confidence interval, 1.02-2.72, P=0.04), respectively. Progression-free survival and overall survival rates at 5 years were 92% and 96%, respectively. Achieving a major molecular response at 1 year was associated with complete absence of progression and a probability of achieving a complete molecular response of 89%. CONCLUSIONS: The addition of intravenous cytarabine to imatinib as upfront therapy for patients with chronic myeloid leukemia is associated with a high rate of complete molecular responses (Clinicaltrials.Gov Identifier: NCT00028847).","['Deenik, Wendy', 'Janssen, Jeroen J W M', 'van der Holt, Bronno', 'Verhoef, Gregor E G', 'Smit, Willem M', 'Kersten, Marie Jose', 'Daenen, Simon M G J', 'Verdonck, Leo F', 'Ferrant, Augustin', 'Schattenberg, Anton V M B', 'Sonneveld, Pieter', 'van Marwijk Kooy, Marinus', 'Wittebol, Shulamit', 'Willemze, Roelof', 'Wijermans, Pierre W', 'Beverloo, H Berna', 'Lowenberg, Bob', 'Valk, Peter J M', 'Ossenkoppele, Gert J', 'Cornelissen, Jan J']","['Deenik W', 'Janssen JJ', 'van der Holt B', 'Verhoef GE', 'Smit WM', 'Kersten MJ', 'Daenen SM', 'Verdonck LF', 'Ferrant A', 'Schattenberg AV', 'Sonneveld P', 'van Marwijk Kooy M', 'Wittebol S', 'Willemze R', 'Wijermans PW', 'Beverloo HB', 'Lowenberg B', 'Valk PJ', 'Ossenkoppele GJ', 'Cornelissen JJ']","['Erasmus University Medical Center, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20091216,Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,"['0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Benzamides', 'Cytarabine/*administration & dosage', 'Cytogenetic Analysis', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Therapy, Combination', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*diagnosis/*drug therapy/genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Piperazines/*administration & dosage', 'Pyrimidines/*administration & dosage', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Young Adult']",2009/12/18 06:00,2011/08/09 06:00,['2009/12/18 06:00'],"['2009/12/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/12/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/08/09 06:00 [medline]']","['haematol.2009.016766 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.2009.016766 [doi]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2010 Jun;95(6):914-21. doi: 10.3324/haematol.2009.016766.

Point mutations in the BCR-ABL kinase domain are probably the most common mechanisms of imatinib resistance. DESIGN AND METHODS: We assessed the influence of additional chromosomal aberrations and BCR-ABL kinase domain mutations on the response to the second-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitor nilotinib after imatinib-failure. Standard cytogenetic analysis of metaphases was performed to detect additional chromosomal aberrations and the BCR-ABL kinase domain was sequenced to detect point mutations. RESULTS: Among 53 patients with a median follow-up of 16 months, of whom 38, 5 and 10 were in chronic phase, accelerated phase and blast crisis, respectively, 19 (36%) had additional chromosomal aberrations and 20 (38%) had BCR-ABL kinase domain mutations. The 2-year overall survival rate of all patients with-out additional chromosomal aberrations (89%) was higher than that of patients with such aberrations (54%) (P=0.0025). Among patients with chronic phase disease, overall survival at 2 years was 100% and 62% for patients without or with additional chromosomal aberrations, respectively (P=0.0024). BCR-ABL kinase domain mutations were associated with lower remission rates in response to nilotinib, with 9 of 20 (45%) of these patients achieving a major cytogenetic remission as compared to 26 of 33 (79%) patients without mutations (P<0.05). However, overall survival was not affected by BCR-ABL kinase domain mutations. CONCLUSIONS: Whereas BCR-ABL kinase domain mutations may confer more specific resistance to nilotinib, which will predominantly affect response rates, the presence of additional chromosomal aberrations may reflect genetic instability and, therefore, intrinsic aggressiveness of the disease which will be less amenable to subsequent alternative treatments and thus negatively affect overall survival. Conventional cytogenetic analyses remain mandatory during follow-up of patients with chronic myeloid leukemia under tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy.","['Kim, Theo D', 'Turkmen, Seval', 'Schwarz, Michaela', 'Koca, Gokben', 'Nogai, Hendrik', 'Bommer, Christiane', 'Dorken, Bernd', 'Daniel, Peter', 'le Coutre, Philipp']","['Kim TD', 'Turkmen S', 'Schwarz M', 'Koca G', 'Nogai H', 'Bommer C', 'Dorken B', 'Daniel P', 'le Coutre P']","['Klinik fur Hamatologie und Onkologie, Charite - Universitatsmedizin Berlin, Campus Virchow- Klinikum, Augustenburger Platz 1, 13353 Berlin, Germany. theo.kim@charite.de']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20091216,Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,"['0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'F41401512X (nilotinib)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Benzamides', '*Chromosome Aberrations', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Disease Progression', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/*genetics/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Philadelphia Chromosome', 'Piperazines/therapeutic use', 'Point Mutation/*genetics', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/therapeutic use', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Pyrimidines/*therapeutic use', 'Remission Induction', 'Salvage Therapy', 'Survival Rate', 'Treatment Outcome']",2009/12/18 06:00,2010/08/25 06:00,['2009/12/18 06:00'],"['2009/12/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/12/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/08/25 06:00 [medline]']","['haematol.2009.014712 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.2009.014712 [doi]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2010 Apr;95(4):582-8. doi: 10.3324/haematol.2009.014712.

Here, we compared patients with or without NOTCH1 mutations and report that the former presented higher MYC transcript levels and decreased PTEN mRNA expression. We recently showed that T-ALL cells frequently display CK2-mediated PTEN phosphorylation, resulting in PTEN protein stabilization and concomitant functional inactivation. Accordingly, the T-ALL samples analyzed, irrespectively of their NOTCH1 mutational status, expressed significantly higher PTEN protein levels than normal controls. To evaluate the integrated functional impact of Notch transcriptional and CK2 post-translational inactivation of PTEN, we treated T-ALL cells with both the gamma-secretase inhibitor DAPT and the CK2 inhibitors DRB/TBB. Our data suggest that combined use of gamma-secretase and CK2 inhibitors may have therapeutic potential in T-ALL.","['Silva, Ana', 'Jotta, Patricia Y', 'Silveira, Andre B', 'Ribeiro, Daniel', 'Brandalise, Silvia R', 'Yunes, J Andres', 'Barata, Joao T']","['Silva A', 'Jotta PY', 'Silveira AB', 'Ribeiro D', 'Brandalise SR', 'Yunes JA', 'Barata JT']","['Cancer Biology Unit, Instituto de Medicina Molecular, Lisbon University Medical School, Av Prof Egas Moniz, 1649-028 Lisboa, Portugal.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20091216,Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,"['0 (4,5,6,7-tetrabromobenzotriazole)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (NOTCH1 protein, human)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptor, Notch1)', '0 (Triazoles)', '53-85-0 (Dichlororibofuranosylbenzimidazole)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Casein Kinase II)', 'EC 3.1.3.67 (PTEN Phosphohydrolase)', 'EC 3.1.3.67 (PTEN protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.- (Amyloid Precursor Protein Secretases)']",IM,"['Amyloid Precursor Protein Secretases/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Blotting, Western', 'Casein Kinase II/*antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cell Size/drug effects', 'Child', 'Dichlororibofuranosylbenzimidazole/pharmacology', 'Drug Therapy, Combination', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'Mutation/genetics', 'PTEN Phosphohydrolase/*genetics/metabolism', 'Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/*genetics/metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'Receptor, Notch1/*genetics/metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Signal Transduction', 'Triazoles/pharmacology']",2009/12/18 06:00,2010/08/25 06:00,['2009/12/18 06:00'],"['2009/12/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/12/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/08/25 06:00 [medline]']","['haematol.2009.011999 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.2009.011999 [doi]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2010 Apr;95(4):674-8. doi: 10.3324/haematol.2009.011999.

Body composition and BMD were measured repeatedly during and after treatment using dual energy X-ray absorptiometry. RESULTS: Non-carriers of VDR 5'-end (Cdx-2/GATA) haplotype 3 revealed a significant larger fat gain than carriers (Delta%fat: non-carriers: +1.76SDS, carriers: +0.77SDS, P<0.001).

This regulation is achieved via action of two multiprotein PcG complexes--PRC2 (EED) and PRC1 [B-cell-specific Moloney murine leukemia virus integration site 1 (Bmi-1)]. These complexes modulate gene expression by increasing histone methylation and reducing acetylation--leading to a closed chromatin conformation. Activity of these proteins is associated with increased cell proliferation and survival. We show increased expression of key PcG proteins in immortalized keratinocytes and skin cancer cell lines. We examine the role of two key PcG proteins, Bmi-1 and enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (Ezh2), and the impact of the active agent in green tea, (-)-epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), on the function of these regulators. EGCG treatment of SCC-13 cells reduces Bmi-1 and Ezh2 level and this is associated with reduced cell survival. The reduction in survival is associated with a global reduction in histone H3 lysine 27 trimethylation, a hallmark of PRC2 complex action. This change in PcG protein expression is associated with reduced expression of key proteins that enhance progression through the cell cycle [cyclin-dependent kinase (cdk)1, cdk2, cdk4, cyclin D1, cyclin E, cyclin A and cyclin B1] and increased expression of proteins that inhibit cell cycle progression (p21 and p27). Apoptosis is also enhanced, as evidenced by increased caspase 9, 8 and 3 cleavage and increased poly(adenosine diphosphate ribose) polymerase cleavage. EGCG treatment also increases Bax and suppresses Bcl-xL expression. Vector-mediated enhanced Bmi-1 expression reverses these EGCG-dependent changes. These findings suggest that green tea polyphenols reduce skin tumor cell survival by influencing PcG-mediated epigenetic regulatory mechanisms.","['Balasubramanian, Sivaprakasam', 'Adhikary, Gautam', 'Eckert, Richard L']","['Balasubramanian S', 'Adhikary G', 'Eckert RL']","['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, University of Maryland School of Medicine, 108 North Greene Street, Baltimore, MD 21201, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20091216,England,Carcinogenesis,Carcinogenesis,8008055,"['0 (Anticarcinogenic Agents)', '0 (BMI1 protein, human)', '0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (Culture Media, Serum-Free)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Polycomb-Group Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '8R1V1STN48 (Catechin)', 'BQM438CTEL (epigallocatechin gallate)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (EZH2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Enhancer of Zeste Homolog 2 Protein)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Polycomb Repressive Complex 2)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Polycomb Repressive Complex 1)']",IM,"['Anticarcinogenic Agents/antagonists & inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Carcinoma, Squamous Cell/*pathology', 'Catechin/*analogs & derivatives/antagonists & inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Cell Count', 'Cell Cycle Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics/physiology', 'Cell Line, Transformed/cytology/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor/cytology/drug effects', 'Culture Media, Serum-Free', 'DNA Replication/drug effects', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics/*physiology', 'Enhancer of Zeste Homolog 2 Protein', 'Epigenesis, Genetic/drug effects', 'Gene Knockdown Techniques', 'Genetic Vectors/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Keratinocytes/cytology/drug effects', 'Neoplasm Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics/*physiology', 'Nuclear Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics/*physiology', 'Polycomb Repressive Complex 1', 'Polycomb Repressive Complex 2', 'Polycomb-Group Proteins', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics/*physiology', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/physiology', 'Repressor Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics/*physiology', 'Skin Neoplasms/*pathology', 'Transcription Factors/biosynthesis/genetics/*physiology']",2009/12/18 06:00,2010/04/15 06:00,['2009/12/18 06:00'],"['2009/12/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/12/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/04/15 06:00 [medline]']","['bgp314 [pii]', '10.1093/carcin/bgp314 [doi]']",ppublish,Carcinogenesis. 2010 Mar;31(3):496-503. doi: 10.1093/carcin/bgp314.

However, its exact cellular functions are poorly understood. By utilizing a proteomics-based approach, in this work, we identify that the human ANP32B protein is cleaved during apoptosis induction by NSC606985, a novel camptothecin analog. Further investigation shows that various apoptosis inducers cause a decrease of full-length ANP32B in multiple cell lines with a concomitant increase of an approximately 17 kDa fragment. The proteolytic cleavage of ANP32B is inhibited by a specific caspase-3 inhibitor Z-DEVD-fmk, and it cannot be seen in NSC606985-induced death of caspase-3-deficient MCF-7 cells. In vitro caspase cleavage assay and mutagenesis experiment reveal that ANP32B is a direct substrate of caspase-3 and it is primarily cleaved at the sequence of Ala-Glu-Val-Asp, after Asp-163. Additionally, the reduced expression of endogenous ANP32B by specific small interfering RNA enhances caspase-3 activation and apoptosis induction by NSC606985 and etoposide. These results suggest that ANP32B is a novel substrate for caspase-3 and acts as a negative regulator for apoptosis, the mechanism of which remains to be explored.","['Shen, Shao-Ming', 'Yu, Yun', 'Wu, Ying-Li', 'Cheng, Jin-Ke', 'Wang, Li-Shun', 'Chen, Guo-Qiang']","['Shen SM', 'Yu Y', 'Wu YL', 'Cheng JK', 'Wang LS', 'Chen GQ']","['Institute of Health Science, Shanghai Institutes of Biological Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences-Shanghai Jiao-Tong University School of Medicine, No. 280, Chong-Qing South Road, Shanghai 200025, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20091216,England,Carcinogenesis,Carcinogenesis,8008055,"['0 (ANP32B protein, human)', '0 (Acetophenones)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzopyrans)', '0 (Cysteine Proteinase Inhibitors)', '0 (NSC606985)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', 'E29LP3ZMUH (rottlerin)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'XT3Z54Z28A (Camptothecin)']",IM,"['Acetophenones/pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects/*physiology', 'Benzopyrans/pharmacology', 'Camptothecin/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Carcinoma/metabolism/*pathology', 'Caspase 3/*metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor/drug effects/metabolism', 'Cysteine Proteinase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Down-Regulation', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/metabolism/*pathology', 'Male', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Neoplasms/metabolism/pathology', 'Nuclear Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', 'RNA Interference', 'RNA, Small Interfering/pharmacology', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/metabolism', 'Spectrometry, Mass, Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption-Ionization', 'Substrate Specificity']",2009/12/18 06:00,2010/04/15 06:00,['2009/12/18 06:00'],"['2009/12/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/12/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/04/15 06:00 [medline]']","['bgp320 [pii]', '10.1093/carcin/bgp320 [doi]']",ppublish,Carcinogenesis. 2010 Mar;31(3):419-26. doi: 10.1093/carcin/bgp320.

METHODS: A prospective non-randomized study was carried out between 30 May, 2003 and 3 June, 2004 in consecutive neutropenic patients who required imaging of the thorax and were treated for acute myeloid leukaemia. Each patient had a baseline 2-view chest radiograph followed by LDCT. Both the CXR and the LDCT studies were blindly and independently reviewed by two chest radiologists. RESULTS: Forty patients were enrolled: 24 male and 16 female, mean age 53.5 years (range 18-83) and an average neutrophil count of 0.78 x 10(9)/L. Patients had CXR within a mean of 40 min from the LDCT. Overall, 31 (77.5%) of 40 CXR were abnormal, whereas LDCT detected abnormalities in 38 (95%) of 40 patients. LDCT demonstrated three times the number of lung nodules as CXR and twice as many ground-glass opacities. Lung consolidation was detected similarly using both techniques, but LDCT demonstrated more extensive and multi-focal consolidation. The majority of nodules detected only on LDCT were subcentimetre in diameter. The additional information provided by LDCT led to an alteration in the clinical management of 11 (27.5%) of 40 patients. CONCLUSION: LDCT is a useful tool in the initial investigation of suspected pulmonary complication in neutropenic patients. This is supported by the additional information it provides to the CXR with reduced radiation when compared to conventional CT.","['Patsios, Demetris', 'Maimon, Nimrod', 'Chung, TaeBong', 'Roberts, Heidi', 'Disperati, Patricia', 'Minden, Mark', 'Paul, Narinder']","['Patsios D', 'Maimon N', 'Chung T', 'Roberts H', 'Disperati P', 'Minden M', 'Paul N']","['Department of Medical Imaging, University Health Network, Toronto General Hospital, Toronto, ON M5G 2C4, Canada. nimrod.maimon@gmail.com']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article']",20091216,England,Respir Med,Respiratory medicine,8908438,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*diagnostic imaging', 'Lung Neoplasms/*diagnostic imaging', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neutropenia/*diagnostic imaging', 'Prospective Studies', 'Radiation Dosage', 'Tomography, X-Ray Computed/*methods', 'Young Adult']",2009/12/18 06:00,2010/10/01 06:00,['2009/12/18 06:00'],"['2008/02/20 00:00 [received]', '2009/11/09 00:00 [revised]', '2009/11/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/12/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/12/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/10/01 06:00 [medline]']","['S0954-6111(09)00366-7 [pii]', '10.1016/j.rmed.2009.11.003 [doi]']",ppublish,Respir Med. 2010 Apr;104(4):600-5. doi: 10.1016/j.rmed.2009.11.003.

The sample population included up to 30 randomly selected animals from 179 randomly selected farms in five provinces in Canada, from which 23 farms did not meet the inclusion criteria for the final dataset. Serum samples were tested for antibodies against the stated pathogens using commercially available diagnostic tests. A Cox proportional hazards model with shared (herd-level) frailty was utilized to analyze the CI data. In this model, BLV-seropositive cows had a 7% lower rate of conception compared to seronegative cows (P=0.06). Mixed logistic regression models of CI>484 days, CI>534 days, and CI>584 days were built to explore factors of long CIs. These cut-offs were selected to represent calving-to-conception intervals of >200 days, >250 days, and >300 days. BLV-seropositive cows had higher odds of having a CI>484 days compared to BLV-seronegative cows, and BLV serostatus interacted with lactation number in this model, with 1st lactation seropositive cows being more likely to have a CI>484 days than older seropositive cows. NC-seropositive cows had a 1.27 times higher odds of exhibiting a CI>484 days, a 1.37 times higher odds of a CI>534 days, and a 1.54 times higher odds of a CI>584 days, compared to NC-seronegative cows. Neither BVDV nor MAP seropositivity showed any significant effect in these models. For the FSC models, a first service was classified successful (pregnancy=1) if it was the cow's last service and she calved 270-290 days later. A mixed logistic regression model of FSC revealed an interaction between NC and BVDV-seropositivity at the herd level, with odds ratios of 0.64, 1.06 and 0.85 for NC-seropositive cows (compared to NC-seronegative cows) in BVDV-seronegative, BVDV-seropositive and BVDV-missing herds, respectively. BLV and MAP seropositivity had no significant impact on FSC. All models controlled for herd-clustering effects, and included parity, linear score of somatic cell counts, peak milk, and province to control for confounding. The overall FSC was 51%, the average CI was 393 days, and 18%, 9% and 5% of lactations had CI>484 days, >534 days, and >584 days, respectively.","['Vanleeuwen, J A', 'Haddad, J P', 'Dohoo, I R', 'Keefe, G P', 'Tiwari, A', 'Tremblay, R']","['Vanleeuwen JA', 'Haddad JP', 'Dohoo IR', 'Keefe GP', 'Tiwari A', 'Tremblay R']","['Department of Health Management, Atlantic Veterinary College, University of Prince Edward Island, 550, University Avenue, Charlottetown, PE, Canada. jvanleeuwen@upei.ca <jvanleeuwen@upei.ca>']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20091216,Netherlands,Prev Vet Med,Preventive veterinary medicine,8217463,"['0 (Antibodies, Bacterial)', '0 (Antibodies, Protozoan)', '0 (Antibodies, Viral)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Bacterial/blood', 'Antibodies, Protozoan/blood', 'Antibodies, Viral/blood', 'Bovine Virus Diarrhea-Mucosal Disease/epidemiology/physiopathology', 'Canada/epidemiology', 'Cattle/*physiology', 'Cattle Diseases/epidemiology/*physiopathology', 'Coccidiosis/epidemiology/physiopathology/veterinary', 'Diarrhea Viruses, Bovine Viral/immunology', 'Enzootic Bovine Leukosis/epidemiology/physiopathology', 'Female', 'Lactation/*physiology', 'Leukemia Virus, Bovine/immunology', 'Logistic Models', 'Milk/cytology/*standards', 'Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis/immunology', 'Neospora/immunology', 'Odds Ratio', 'Paratuberculosis/epidemiology/physiopathology', 'Pregnancy', '*Pregnancy Rate', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'Seroepidemiologic Studies']",2009/12/18 06:00,2010/05/14 06:00,['2009/12/18 06:00'],"['2007/08/04 00:00 [received]', '2009/09/25 00:00 [revised]', '2009/11/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/12/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/12/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/05/14 06:00 [medline]']","['S0167-5877(09)00355-9 [pii]', '10.1016/j.prevetmed.2009.11.012 [doi]']",ppublish,Prev Vet Med. 2010 Apr 1;94(1-2):54-64. doi: 10.1016/j.prevetmed.2009.11.012.

In conjunction with confocal microscopy, these scaffolds were used to study the importance of cell compliance on invasive potential. Acute promyelocytic leukaemia (APL) cells were differentiated with all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) and treated with paclitaxel. Their migration ability into the scaffolds' size-restricted pores, enabled by cell softening during ATRA differentiation, was significantly reduced by paclitaxel treatment, which interferes with cell shape recovery.

We evaluated the growth of three leukaemia subtype-specific cell lines, K-562, HL60 and Kasumi-6, on highly porous scaffolds fabricated from biodegradable and non-biodegradable polymeric materials, such as poly (L-lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA), polyurethane (PU), poly (methyl-methacrylate), poly (D, L-lactade), poly (caprolactone), and polystyrene. Our results show that PLGA and PU supported the best seeding efficiency and leukaemic growth. Furthermore, the PLGA and PU scaffolds were coated with extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins, collagen type I (62.5 or 125 microg/ml) and fibronectin (25 or 50 microg/ml) to provide biorecognition signals. The 3 leukaemia subtype-specific lines grew best on PU scaffolds coated with 62.5 microg/ml collagen type I over 6 weeks in the absence of exogenous growth factors.

Using a human promyelocytic leukemia (HL-60) cell line, we showed that R in combination with VE synergistically decreased the expressions of VEGF protein and mRNA. We also demonstrated that R+VE significantly decreased the binding capacity of nuclear factor-activator protein-1 (AP-1) to the VEGF gene promoter and decreased the expression of c-Jun protein.

The decrease of ROS was only partially associated with the decrease of VEGF secreted (r(2)=0.12, P=0.083). Thus, the present results indicate that R in combination with VE attenuates VEGF expression in HL-60 cells and that this effect is mediated by a decreased binding activity of AP-1 through down-regulation of protein expression of insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (IGF1-R)/IRS-1, while the antioxidant activity of R+VE appears to play a minor role.","['Chuang, Cheng-Hung', 'Huang, Chin-Shiu', 'Hu, Miao-Lin']","['Chuang CH', 'Huang CS', 'Hu ML']","['Department of Food Science and Applied Biotechnology, Hungkuang University, 34 Chung Chie Road, Shalu, Taichung County, Taiwan, Republic of China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20091216,Ireland,Chem Biol Interact,Chemico-biological interactions,0227276,"['0 (Antioxidants)', '0 (Insulin Receptor Substrate Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-jun)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '0 (Transcription Factor AP-1)', '0 (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A)', '1406-18-4 (Vitamin E)', '5G06TVY3R7 (Rutin)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor, IGF Type 1)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*pharmacology', 'Antioxidants/*pharmacology', 'Down-Regulation', 'Drug Synergism', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Insulin Receptor Substrate Proteins/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-jun/metabolism', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism', 'Receptor, IGF Type 1/metabolism', 'Rutin/*pharmacology', 'Transcription Factor AP-1/*metabolism', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Vitamin E/*pharmacology']",2009/12/18 06:00,2010/02/26 06:00,['2009/12/18 06:00'],"['2009/10/14 00:00 [received]', '2009/12/05 00:00 [revised]', '2009/12/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/12/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/12/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/02/26 06:00 [medline]']","['S0009-2797(09)00535-3 [pii]', '10.1016/j.cbi.2009.12.007 [doi]']",ppublish,Chem Biol Interact. 2010 Feb 12;183(3):434-41. doi: 10.1016/j.cbi.2009.12.007.

We aimed to provide a biological rationale based on the sorafenib-taxotere interaction for the clinical treatment of gastric cancer. In vitro experiments were performed on four human gastric cancer cell lines (GK2, AKG, KKP and NCI-N87). Cytotoxicity was evaluated by sulforhodamine B (SRB) assay, cell cycle perturbations, apoptosis and mitotic catastrophe were assessed by flow cytometric and microscopic analyses, and protein expression was studied by Western blot. In the in vivo experiments, nude mice xenografted with the most resistant line were treated with sorafenib and docetaxel singly or in association. Sorafenib inhibited cell growth (IG(50) values ranged from 3.4 to 8.1 muM) and caused down-regulation of MAP-K/ERK phosphorylation and of mcl-1 and p-bad expression after a 48-hr exposure. Apoptosis induction was associated with caspase-3 and -9 activation and mitochondrial membrane depolarization. The drug combination enhanced apoptosis (up to 80%) and produced a synergistic interaction when low doses of the taxane preceded administration of the antityrosine kinase. This synergism was probably due to the induction of an anomalous multidiploid G0-G1 peak and to consequent mitotic catastrophe, which increased sensitivity to sorafenib. Consistent with in vitro results, the docetaxel-sorafenib sequence exhibited high therapeutic efficacy in NCI-N87 mouse xenografts producing tumour weight inhibition (> 65%), tumour growth delay (up to 25 days) and increased mouse survival (30%). Our findings suggest the potential clinical usefulness of treatment with sorafenib and docetaxel for advanced gastric cancer.","['Tesei, Anna', 'Leonetti, Carlo', 'Zupi, Gabriella', 'Scarsella, Marco', 'Brigliadori, Giovanni', 'Ulivi, Paola', 'Fabbri, Francesco', 'Arienti, Chiara', 'Amadori, Dino', 'Passardi, Alessandro', 'Silvestrini, Rosella', 'Zoli, Wainer']","['Tesei A', 'Leonetti C', 'Zupi G', 'Scarsella M', 'Brigliadori G', 'Ulivi P', 'Fabbri F', 'Arienti C', 'Amadori D', 'Passardi A', 'Silvestrini R', 'Zoli W']","['Istituto Scientifico Romagnolo per lo Studio e la Cura dei Tumori, Meldola, Italy. anna.tesei@irst.emr.it']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,England,J Cell Mol Med,Journal of cellular and molecular medicine,101083777,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzenesulfonates)', '0 (Mcl1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Phenylurea Compounds)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Pyridines)', '0 (Rhodamines)', '0 (Taxoids)', '15H5577CQD (Docetaxel)', '25X51I8RD4 (Niacinamide)', '2609-88-3 (lissamine rhodamine B)', '9ZOQ3TZI87 (Sorafenib)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*administration & dosage/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Benzenesulfonates/*administration & dosage/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Docetaxel', 'Drug Synergism', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Mice, Nude', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/metabolism', 'Mitosis/drug effects', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Niacinamide/analogs & derivatives', 'Phenylurea Compounds', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/biosynthesis', 'Pyridines/*administration & dosage/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Rhodamines', 'Sorafenib', 'Stomach Neoplasms/*drug therapy', 'Taxoids/*administration & dosage/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",2009/12/18 06:00,2012/04/17 06:00,['2009/12/18 06:00'],"['2009/12/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/12/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/04/17 06:00 [medline]']","['JCMM993 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1582-4934.2009.00993.x [doi]']",ppublish,J Cell Mol Med. 2011 Feb;15(2):316-26. doi: 10.1111/j.1582-4934.2009.00993.x.,15,,,PMC3822798,,,,"['(c) 2011 The Authors Journal of Cellular and Molecular Medicine (c) 2011', 'Foundation for Cellular and Molecular Medicine/Blackwell Publishing Ltd.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study we show that enforced expression of Evi1 in Rat1 fibroblasts protects from paclitaxel-induced apoptosis, consistent with previously published studies. Surprisingly, however, these cells show increased sensitivity to hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2))-induced apoptosis, demonstrated by elevated caspase 3 catalytic activity. This effect is caused by a reduction in carbonic anhydrase III (caIII) production. caIII transcripts are repressed by 92-97% by Evi1 expression, accompanied by a similar reduction in caIII protein. Reporter assays with the rat caIII gene promoter show repressed activity, demonstrating that Evi1 either directly or indirectly modulates transcription of this gene in Rat1 cells. Targeted knockdown of caIII alone, with Dicer-substrate short inhibitory RNAs, also increases the sensitivity of Rat1 fibroblasts to H(2)O(2), which occurs in the absence of any other changes mediated by Evi1 expression. Enforced expression of caIII in Evi1-expressing Rat1 cells reverts the phenotype, restoring H(2)O(2) resistance. Together these data show that Evi1 represses transcription of caIII gene expression, leading to increased sensitivity to H(2)O(2)-induced apoptosis in Rat1 cells and might suggest the basis for the development of a novel therapeutic strategy for the treatment of leukaemias and solid tumours where EVI1 is overexpressed.","['Roy, P', 'Reavey, E', 'Rayne, M', 'Roy, S', 'Abed El Baky, M', 'Ishii, Y', 'Bartholomew, C']","['Roy P', 'Reavey E', 'Rayne M', 'Roy S', 'Abed El Baky M', 'Ishii Y', 'Bartholomew C']","['Department of Biological & Biomedical Sciences, Glasgow Caledonian University, City Campus, Glasgow, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20091215,England,FEBS J,The FEBS journal,101229646,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (MDS1 and EVI1 Complex Locus Protein)', '0 (Mecom protein, mouse)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', 'BBX060AN9V (Hydrogen Peroxide)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Casp3 protein, rat)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 4.2.1.- (Carbonic Anhydrase III)', 'P88XT4IS4D (Paclitaxel)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects/genetics/physiology', 'Base Sequence', 'Carbonic Anhydrase III/antagonists & inhibitors/*genetics', 'Caspase 3/metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'DNA Primers/genetics', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/*physiology', 'Down-Regulation/drug effects', 'Hydrogen Peroxide/*pharmacology', 'MDS1 and EVI1 Complex Locus Protein', 'Mice', 'Paclitaxel/pharmacology', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/drug effects', 'Proto-Oncogenes/genetics/*physiology', 'RNA, Small Interfering/genetics', 'Rats', 'Recombinant Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/*physiology', 'Transfection']",2009/12/18 06:00,2010/02/02 06:00,['2009/12/18 06:00'],"['2009/12/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/12/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/02/02 06:00 [medline]']","['EJB7496 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1742-4658.2009.07496.x [doi]']",ppublish,FEBS J. 2010 Jan;277(2):441-52. doi: 10.1111/j.1742-4658.2009.07496.x.

There are few treatment options available for patients with MDS. Studies into the molecular biology of MDS have demonstrated abnormal patterns of DNA methylation that lead to silencing of tumor-suppressor genes. Hypomethylating agents are compounds that have the potential to reverse the aberrant DNA methylation and increase the expression of silenced genes, leading to cellular differentiation and/or apoptosis. Decitabine is a cytidine analogue that has activity as a hypomethylating agent and has been evaluated in the therapy of patients with high-risk MDS. Several studies have confirmed the clinical activity of low-dose decitabine in patients with high-risk MDS, leading to responses in approximately 50% of patients, with low treatment-related mortality. Responses have even been seen in patients with high-risk cytogenetic abnormalities, and some studies have demonstrated increased re-expression of genes that were previously silenced by hypermethylation, such as CDKN2B/p15INK4B.

METHODS: Surface expression of TRAIL receptors (TRAIL-R1-4) and expression levels of the antiapoptotic BCL-2 proteins MCL-1 and BCL-x(L) were analyzed by flow cytometry and Western blotting, respectively. Knock-down of MCL-1 and BCL-x(L) was performed by transfecting specific small interfering RNAs. HCC cells were treated with kinase inhibitors and chemotherapeutic drugs. Apoptosis induction and cell viability were analyzed via flow cytometry and 3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay. RESULTS: TRAIL-R1 and -R2 were profoundly expressed on the HCC cell lines Huh7 and Hep-G2. However, treatment of Huh7 and Hep-G2 with TRAIL and agonistic antibodies only induced minor apoptosis rates. Apoptosis resistance towards TRAIL could be considerably reduced by adding the chemotherapeutic drugs 5-fluorouracil and doxorubicin as well as the kinase inhibitors LY294002 [inhibition of phosphoinositol-3-kinase (PI3K)], AG1478 (epidermal growth factor receptor kinase), PD98059 (MEK1), rapamycin (mammalian target of rapamycin) and the multi-kinase inhibitor Sorafenib. Furthermore, the antiapoptotic BCL-2 proteins MCL-1 and BCL-x(L) play a major role in TRAIL resistance: knock-down by RNA interference increased TRAIL-induced apoptosis of HCC cells. Additionally, knock-down of MCL-1 and BCL-x(L) led to a significant sensitization of HCC cells towards inhibition of both c-Jun N-terminal kinase and PI3K. CONCLUSION: Our data identify the blockage of survival kinases, combination with chemotherapeutic drugs and targeting of antiapoptotic BCL-2 proteins as promising ways to overcome TRAIL resistance in HCC.","['Koehler, Bruno-Christian', 'Urbanik, Toni', 'Vick, Binje', 'Boger, Regina-Johanna', 'Heeger, Steffen', 'Galle, Peter-R', 'Schuchmann, Marcus', 'Schulze-Bergkamen, Henning']","['Koehler BC', 'Urbanik T', 'Vick B', 'Boger RJ', 'Heeger S', 'Galle PR', 'Schuchmann M', 'Schulze-Bergkamen H']","['First Department of Medicine, Johannes Gutenberg-University Mainz, 55101 Mainz, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,World J Gastroenterol,World journal of gastroenterology,100883448,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (BCL2L1 protein, human)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Receptors, TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand)', '0 (TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand)', '0 (bcl-X Protein)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', 'U3P01618RT (Fluorouracil)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis/*physiology', 'Carcinoma, Hepatocellular/*drug therapy/*metabolism/pathology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Doxorubicin/therapeutic use', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/therapeutic use', 'Fluorouracil/therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Liver Neoplasms/*drug therapy/*metabolism/pathology', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/genetics/metabolism', 'Receptors, TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand/genetics/metabolism', 'TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand/genetics/*metabolism', 'bcl-X Protein/genetics/metabolism']",2009/12/17 06:00,2010/02/06 06:00,['2009/12/17 06:00'],"['2009/12/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/12/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/02/06 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3748/wjg.15.5924 [doi]'],ppublish,World J Gastroenterol. 2009 Dec 21;15(47):5924-35. doi: 10.3748/wjg.15.5924.,15,,,PMC2795179,,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['(Mitogen-activated protein kinase)/(extracellular signal regulated kinase) kinase', '5-fluorouracil', 'Apoptosis', 'BCL-xL', 'Doxorubicin', 'Hepatocellular carcinoma', 'MCL-1', 'Phosphoinositol-3-kinase', 'Sorafenib', 'Tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis inducing ligand', 'c-Jun N-terminal kinase']",,,,,,,,,,,

However, the mechanism that accounts for this effect is not known. ZAP-70 expression has previously been associated with increased B cell antigen receptor signaling upon surface immunoglobulin ligation in vitro as shown by ZAP-70 and Syk phosphorylation. This finding has led to the suggestion that a more aggressive clinical course is correlated with B cell antigen receptor signaling. Using high resolution immunophenotyping to analyze CLL cells ex vivo (without stimulation in vitro), we have demonstrated CLL cells from all patients express some ZAP-70 and that increased expression of ZAP-70 is correlated with decreased levels of phosphorylated ZAP-70 and phosphorylated Syk measured directly ex vivo. Conversely, high levels of phosphorylated ZAP-70 and phosphorylated Syk are found only in samples with low levels of ZAP-70 expression, and Syk and ZAP-70 phosphorylation appear to be mostly independent of each other. Additionally, Syk phosphorylation is directly correlated with levels of p21(cip1), a cell cycle inhibitor and a p53 target. Together these findings suggest that lower levels of p21(cip1) and/or a defect in p53 activity may account in part for the more aggressive disease course in patients with high levels of ZAP-70 rather than enhanced B cell antigen receptor signaling as has been previously hypothesized.","['Kaplan, David', 'Meyerson, Howard J', 'Li, Xiaofeng', 'Drasny, Carly', 'Liu, Fangfang', 'Costaldi, Mark', 'Barr, Paul', 'Lazarus, Hillard M']","['Kaplan D', 'Meyerson HJ', 'Li X', 'Drasny C', 'Liu F', 'Costaldi M', 'Barr P', 'Lazarus HM']","['Department of Pathology, University Hospitals Case Medical Center, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, Ohio 44106, USA. david.kaplan@case.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Cytometry B Clin Cytom,"Cytometry.

Limited treatment options exist for chemotherapy-related hepatoxicity. Given the wide use of MT, the authors investigated MT in both the laboratory and a clinical setting. METHODS: In a double-blind study, children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and hepatic toxicity were randomized to MT or placebo orally for 28 days. Liver function tests were evaluated during the study period. To assess MT in vitro, the authors evaluated supratherapeutic concentrations in an ALL cell line. RESULTS: Fifty children were enrolled. No significant differences in frequency of side effects, incidence and severity of toxicities, or infections were observed between groups. There were no significant changes in mean amino alanine transferase (ALT), aspartate amino transferase (AST), or total bilirubin (TB) at Day 28. At Day 56, the MT group had a significantly lower AST (P = .05) and a trend toward a significantly lower ALT (P = .07). Although not significantly different, chemotherapy doses were reduced in 61% of the MT group compared with 72% of the placebo group. In vitro experiments revealed no antagonistic interactions between MT and vincristine or L-asparaginase in CCRF-CEM cells. A modest synergistic effect with vincristine was observed. CONCLUSIONS: In children with ALL and liver toxicity, MT was associated with a trend toward significant reductions in liver toxicity. MT did not antagonize the effects of chemotherapy agents used for the treatment of ALL. Future study is needed to determine the most effective dose and duration of MT and its effect on hepatotoxicity and leukemia-free survival.","['Ladas, Elena J', 'Kroll, David J', 'Oberlies, Nicholas H', 'Cheng, Bin', 'Ndao, Deborah H', 'Rheingold, Susan R', 'Kelly, Kara M']","['Ladas EJ', 'Kroll DJ', 'Oberlies NH', 'Cheng B', 'Ndao DH', 'Rheingold SR', 'Kelly KM']","['Division of Pediatric Oncology, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, New York 10032, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Placebos)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage/*adverse effects/pharmacology', 'Chemical and Drug Induced Liver Injury/*therapy', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Double-Blind Method', 'Drug Evaluation, Preclinical', 'Drug Interactions', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Liver Function Tests', 'Male', '*Milk Thistle/adverse effects', '*Phytotherapy', 'Pilot Projects', 'Placebos', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/complications/*drug therapy']",2009/12/17 06:00,2010/03/10 06:00,['2009/12/17 06:00'],"['2009/12/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/12/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/03/10 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/cncr.24723 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 2010 Jan 15;116(2):506-13. doi: 10.1002/cncr.24723.,116,"['R01 CA104286/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA104286-05/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,PMC3542639,['NIHMS150158'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

RS has a very poor prognosis and its pathogenetic mechanisms are poorly understood. In order to gain additional hints in RS pathogenesis, we performed a genome-wide DNA profiling study of 13 RS phases and eight matched CLL phases using the Affymetrix Human Mapping 250K NspI SNP arrays. Individual genomic profiles were heterogeneous, with no individual lesions occurring in more than half of the cases. However, several observations suggest that MYC pathway might be involved in RS. The 13q13.3-qter region containing MIRHG1 (MIR-17-92), a cluster of microRNA interacting with c-MYC, was acquired at the time of transformation. The 13q gain was coupled with the gain of c-MYC and loss of TP53. Translocation of c-MYC was acquired at transformation in a fraction of cases and this event appeared mutually exclusive with gain of MIRHG1. MYCN, a c-MYC homologue, was also recurrently gained. By comparing RS with 48 de novo DLBCL, RS presented a significantly lower prevalence of deletions affecting the PRDM1 and TNFAIP3, genes on 6q, known to be associated with a post-GC phenotype. In conclusion, the genomic profile of RS seems to differ from what observed in de novo DLBCL and in other transformed DLBCL. Genomic lesions occurring in RS are heterogeneous suggesting the existence of different RS subsets, possibly due to different transforming mechanisms. A deregulation of MYC pathway might represent one of the main transformation events in the pathogenesis of a subset of RS clonally related to the previous CLL.","['Scandurra, Marta', 'Rossi, Davide', 'Deambrogi, Clara', 'Rancoita, Paola M V', 'Chigrinova, Ekaterina', 'Mian, Michael', 'Cerri, Michaela', 'Rasi, Silvia', 'Sozzi, Elisa', 'Forconi, Francesco', 'Ponzoni, Maurilio', 'Moreno, Santiago M', 'Piris, Miguel A', 'Inghirami, Giorgio', 'Zucca, Emanuele', 'Gattei, Valter', 'Rinaldi, Andrea', 'Kwee, Ivo', 'Gaidano, Gianluca', 'Bertoni, Francesco']","['Scandurra M', 'Rossi D', 'Deambrogi C', 'Rancoita PM', 'Chigrinova E', 'Mian M', 'Cerri M', 'Rasi S', 'Sozzi E', 'Forconi F', 'Ponzoni M', 'Moreno SM', 'Piris MA', 'Inghirami G', 'Zucca E', 'Gattei V', 'Rinaldi A', 'Kwee I', 'Gaidano G', 'Bertoni F']","['Laboratory of Experimental Oncology, Oncology Institute of Southern Switzerland (IOSI), Bellinzona, Switzerland.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Hematol Oncol,Hematological oncology,8307268,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '138415-26-6 (PRDM1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.1.1.- (Positive Regulatory Domain I-Binding Factor 1)', 'EC 3.4.19.12 (TNFAIP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.19.12 (Tumor Necrosis Factor alpha-Induced Protein 3)']",IM,"['Chromosome Aberrations', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 6/genetics', 'DNA-Binding Proteins', 'Disease Progression', '*Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Rearrangement, B-Lymphocyte', 'Genes, myc', 'Genes, p53', 'Humans', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/genetics', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/genetics/pathology', 'Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse/etiology/*genetics', 'MicroRNAs/genetics', 'Nuclear Proteins/genetics', 'Phenotype', 'Positive Regulatory Domain I-Binding Factor 1', 'Recurrence', 'Repressor Proteins/genetics', 'Sequence Deletion', 'Syndrome', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor alpha-Induced Protein 3']",2009/12/17 06:00,2010/06/29 06:00,['2009/12/17 06:00'],"['2009/12/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/12/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/06/29 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/hon.932 [doi]'],ppublish,Hematol Oncol. 2010 Jun;28(2):62-7. doi: 10.1002/hon.932.,28,,,,,,,"['(c) 2009 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Cell lysates derived from human and murine suspension cell lines significantly increased the transduction of human TF-1 and K-562 cell lines by gibbon ape leukemia virus-pseudotyped retroviral vectors without altering tropism. The transduction efficiency of TF-1 cells increased as a function of lysate concentration and decreased with increasing target cell concentrations. This was adequately predicted using a saturation equation based on the lysed-to-target cell concentration ratio, R, where: Fold increase = 1+Fold_(Max) (R/(K_(L)+R)). Lysate completely masked the effects of fibronectin when the two were added in combination. With protamine sulfate, the transduction efficiency was increased by lysate to 58% from 20% for protamine sulfate alone.

Moreover, it drives a compensatory route to Imatinib mesylate (IM) possibly involved in the progression of leukemic progenitors towards a drug-resistant phenotype. Accordingly, mTOR inhibitors are proposed for combined therapeutic strategies in CML. The major caveat in the use of mTOR inhibitors for cancer therapy comes from the induction of an mTOR-phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase (PI3k) feedback loop driving the retrograde activation of Akt. Here we show that the rapamycin derivative RAD 001 (everolimus, Novartis Institutes for Biomedical Research) inhibits mTOR and, more importantly, revokes mTOR late re-activation in response to IM. RAD 001 interferes with the assembly of both mTOR complexes: mTORC1 and mTORC2. The inhibition of mTORC2 results in the de-phosphorylation of Akt at Ser(473) in the hydrophobic motif of C-terminal tail required for Akt full activation and precludes Akt re-phosphorylation in response to IM. Moreover, RAD 001-induced inhibition of Akt causes the de-phosphorylation of tuberous sclerosis tumor suppressor protein TSC2 at 14-3-3 binding sites, TSC2 release from 14-3-3 sigma (restoring its inhibitory function on mTORC1) and nuclear import (promoting the nuclear translocation of cyclin-dependent kinase [CDK] inhibitor p27(Kip1), the stabilization of p27(Kip1) ligand with CDK2, and the G(0)/G(1) arrest). RAD 001 cytotoxicity on cells not expressing the BCR-ABL fusion gene or its p210 protein tyrosine kinase (TK) activity suggests that the inhibition of normal hematopoiesis may represent a drug side effect.","['Mancini, Manuela', 'Petta, Sara', 'Martinelli, Giovanni', 'Barbieri, Enza', 'Santucci, Maria A']","['Mancini M', 'Petta S', 'Martinelli G', 'Barbieri E', 'Santucci MA']","['Dipartimento di Ematologia e Scienze Oncologiche ""Lorenzo e Ariosto Seragnoli,"" University of Bologna-Medical School, Bologna, Italy. mancini_manu@yahoo.com']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,J Cell Biochem,Journal of cellular biochemistry,8205768,"['0 (14-3-3 Proteins)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Crtc2 protein, mouse)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Multiprotein Complexes)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (TSC2 protein, human)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tsc2 protein, mouse)', '0 (Tuberous Sclerosis Complex 2 Protein)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', '9HW64Q8G6G (Everolimus)', 'EC 2.7.1.1 (MTOR protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.1.1 (mTOR protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Mechanistic Target of Rapamycin Complex 1)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 3.1.- (Exonucleases)', 'EC 3.1.- (Exoribonucleases)', 'EC 3.1.- (SFN protein, human)', 'W36ZG6FT64 (Sirolimus)']",IM,"['14-3-3 Proteins', 'Active Transport, Cell Nucleus/drug effects', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Benzamides', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Drug Interactions', 'Drug Resistance', 'Everolimus', 'Exonucleases/metabolism', 'Exoribonucleases', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/metabolism', 'Hematopoiesis', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Lethal Dose 50', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/pathology/physiopathology', 'Mechanistic Target of Rapamycin Complex 1', 'Mice', 'Multiprotein Complexes', 'Myeloid Progenitor Cells', 'Neoplasm Proteins/metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Piperazines/*pharmacology', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Proteins', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Pyrimidines/*pharmacology', 'Sirolimus/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases', 'Trans-Activators/metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/metabolism', 'Tuberous Sclerosis Complex 2 Protein', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/metabolism']",2009/12/17 06:00,2010/08/06 06:00,['2009/12/17 06:00'],"['2009/12/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/12/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/08/06 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/jcb.22380 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cell Biochem. 2010 Feb 1;109(2):320-8. doi: 10.1002/jcb.22380.,109,,,,,,,"['(c) 2009 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

The CDKN2A gene is suggested to play a key role in these aberrations. In this study overviewing 9p losses in hematologic neoplasias, we introduce the term focal 9p instability to indicate multiple areas of copy number loss or homozygous loss within a larger heterozygous one in 9p. We have used microarray comparative genomic hybridization to study patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL, n = 140), acute myeloid leukemia (n = 50), chronic lymphocytic leukemia (n = 20), and myelodysplastic syndromes (n = 37). Our results show that 9p instability is restricted to ALL. In total, 58/140 (41%) patients with ALL had a loss in 9p. The 9p instability was detected in 19% of the patients with ALL and always included homozygous loss of CDKN2A along with loss of CDKN2B. Other possibly important genes included MTAP, IFN, MLLT3, JAK2, PTPLAD2, and PAX5. 13/27 (48%) patients with the instability had the BCR/ABL1 fusion gene or other oncogene-activating translocation or structural aberrations. Two patients had homozygous loss of hsa-mir -31, a microRNA known to regulate IKZF1. IKZF1 deletion at 7p12.1 was seen in 10 (37%) patients with the 9p instability. These findings suggest that, in ALL leukemogenesis, loss of CDKN2A and other target genes in the instability region is frequently associated with BCR/ABL1 and IKZF1 dysfunction. The multiple mechanisms leading to 9p instability including physical or epigenetic loss of the target genes, loss of the microRNA cluster, and the role of FRA9G fragile site are discussed.","['Usvasalo, Anu', 'Ninomiya, Shinsuke', 'Raty, Riikka', 'Hollmen, Jaakko', 'Saarinen-Pihkala, Ulla M', 'Elonen, Erkki', 'Knuutila, Sakari']","['Usvasalo A', 'Ninomiya S', 'Raty R', 'Hollmen J', 'Saarinen-Pihkala UM', 'Elonen E', 'Knuutila S']","['Hospital for Children and Adolescents, University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Genes Chromosomes Cancer,"Genes, chromosomes & cancer",9007329,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', '*Chromosomal Instability', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 9', 'Comparative Genomic Hybridization/methods', 'Female', 'Gene Deletion', 'Gene Dosage', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*genetics', 'Loss of Heterozygosity', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*genetics', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis/*methods', 'Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide']",2009/12/17 06:00,2010/05/21 06:00,['2009/12/17 06:00'],"['2009/12/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/12/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/05/21 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/gcc.20741 [doi]'],ppublish,Genes Chromosomes Cancer. 2010 Apr;49(4):309-18. doi: 10.1002/gcc.20741.,49,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although E2F family of transcription factors have been linked to proliferation, apoptosis and differentiation, yet no heed has been paid to understand the role of E2F biology in cellular quiescence. To understand the functional RNomics (regulation of gene transcription through RNA interference) of E2F-1 gene, 2 cancer cell lines, such as Jurkat exhibiting E2F-1 gene overamplification and Hela-229 exhibiting intrinsic downregulation of E2F-1 gene expression, were used in our study. E2F-1 gene knockdown via siRNA within Jurkat cells resulted in upregulation of genes characteristic of quiescence both translationally and transcriptionally, which was accompanied by downregulation of genes at both translational and transcriptional level involved in cell cycle progression and apoptosis. This genomic phenomenon also translated into ultrastructural and phenotypic features typical of quiescent state. These observed results in Jurkat cells were simulated by upregulation of E2F-1 gene in Hela-229 cells through the downregulation of miR 17-5p. This E2F-1-regulated pathway explained as to how Jurkat cells entered exclusively into quiescent state when E2F-1 was downregulated in these cells and how Hela-229 cells proliferate vigorously when E2F-1 was upregulated in such cells. Here, we propose a gene-regulatory pathway which the cell might be using in its entry into either quiescent or proliferative states. Furthermore, this pathway may be useful in designing strategies for the treatment of cancer in general and acute lymphoblastic leukemia in particular.","['Mehrotra, Aanchal', 'Joshi, Kusum', 'Kaul, Deepak']","['Mehrotra A', 'Joshi K', 'Kaul D']","['Department of Experimental Medicine and Biotechnology, Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research, Chandigarh 160012, India.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (E2F1 Transcription Factor)', '0 (E2F1 protein, human)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",IM,"['Apoptosis', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*genetics/metabolism', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Cycle', '*Cell Proliferation', 'E2F1 Transcription Factor/antagonists & inhibitors/*genetics/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Profiling', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics/metabolism']",2009/12/17 06:00,2010/07/21 06:00,['2009/12/17 06:00'],"['2009/12/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/12/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/07/21 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/ijc.25109 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Cancer. 2010 Aug 15;127(4):849-58. doi: 10.1002/ijc.25109.,127,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We compared the presence of specific pluripotency (Oct4, Ssea1) and differentiation markers (Gata4 - primitive endoderm marker; Cdx2 - trophectoderm marker) in blastocysts and inner cell mass (ICM) outgrowths obtained from blastocysts of bank vole, and two mouse hybrids F1(C57Bl/6xCBA/H) and F1(C57Bl/6x129/Sv), which differ in the permissiveness of giving rise to ES cells. We found that, in contrast to mouse, the expression of pluripotency markers in the cells of bank vole ICM outgrowths is progressively downregulated and rapidly lost by the 4th day of culture. This correlates with the appearance of cells expressing Gata4 and Cdx2, indicating differentiation towards primitive endoderm and derivatives of trophectoderm, respectively. We have also shown that heterologous cytokine leukaemia inhibitory factor (LIF) in conjunction with either homologous or heterologous feeder layer is unable to delay differentiation and preserve pluripotency of bank vole embryonic cells. Thus, the conditions optimised for mouse do not support the maintenance of bank vole embryonic cells in the undifferentiated state and do not allow for the isolation of the ES cells. Instead, combination of fibroblast growth factor 2 and activin A allows retention of Oct4 expression in bank vole blastocyst outgrowths during 4-day culture, indicating that signaling pathways operating in human, rather than mouse ES cells, might be involved in the process of self-renewal of bank vole embryonic cells.","['Suwinska, Aneta', 'Tarkowski, Andrzej K', 'Ciemerych, Maria A']","['Suwinska A', 'Tarkowski AK', 'Ciemerych MA']","['Department of Embryology, Institute of Zoology, University of Warsaw, Warsaw, Poland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Spain,Int J Dev Biol,The International journal of developmental biology,8917470,"['0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (activin A)', '103107-01-3 (Fibroblast Growth Factor 2)', '104625-48-1 (Activins)']",IM,"['Activins/*metabolism', 'Animals', 'Arvicolinae/embryology', '*Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Embryo, Mammalian/cytology/*metabolism', 'Embryonic Stem Cells/*metabolism', 'Fibroblast Growth Factor 2/*metabolism', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique, Indirect', 'Humans', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL/embryology', 'Mice, Inbred CBA/embryology', 'Pluripotent Stem Cells/*metabolism', '*Signal Transduction']",2009/12/17 06:00,2010/04/13 06:00,['2009/12/17 06:00'],"['2009/12/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/12/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/04/13 06:00 [medline]']","['082704as [pii]', '10.1387/ijdb.082704as [doi]']",ppublish,Int J Dev Biol. 2010;54(1):113-24. doi: 10.1387/ijdb.082704as.,54,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have recently established the MV4-11 subline, designated as MV4-11 TP53 R248W, which possesses transcriptionally inactive R248W mutation in the TP53 gene. MV4-11 TP53 R248W cells were relatively resistant to AZD1152-HQPA-mediated growth arrest, as measured by MTT and clonogenic assays. AZD1152-HQPA (10-100 nM, 48 h) strikingly induced apoptosis of MV4-11 cells, as assessed by Annexin V binding, loss of mitochondrial outer membrane potential, and activation of caspase cascade, in parallel with up-regulation of p53 and its target molecules Bax and Noxa. Notably, AZD1152-HQPA (10-100 nM, 48 h) induced polyploidy rather than apoptosis in MV4-11 TP53 R248W cells. The polyploid cells were eventually eliminated via apoptosis at later time period (72-120 h) in association with up-regulation of p73. Taken together, p53 plays an important role in AZD1152-HQPA-induced growth arrest and early onset of apoptosis in AML cells.

The dose of oseltamivir was increased to 150 mg twice per day due to the lack of improvement or progression of symptoms. In one case, clinical symptoms resolved without sequelae. In the second case, pulmonary symptomatology continued to deteriorate, despite aggressive polymicrobial treatment, requiring mechanical ventilation and ultimately the patient died from respiratory failure.

In our study, we evaluated the serum level of sCD138 in patients with B-CLL and its relationship with other prognostic markers. There was a significant association between advanced Rai stage and serum sCD138 levels in CLL subjects. Patients with Rai stage III-IV had significantly higher levels of sCD138 with respect to controls (48.85+/-34 ng/ml vs. 31.1+/-19.34 ng/ml; P<0.05).

A novel artificial neural network (ANN) algorithm is proposed for optimizing the classification of multidimensional data, focusing on acute leukemia samples. The programming tool established around the ANN architecture focuses on the classification of normal vs. abnormal blood samples, namely acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML). There were 220 blood samples considered with 60 abnormal samples and 160 normal samples. The algorithm produced very high sensitivity results that improved up to 96.67% in ALL classification with increased data set size. With this type of accuracy, this programming tool provides information to medical doctors in the form of diagnostic references for the specific disease states that are considered for this study. The results obtained prove that a neural network classifier can perform remarkably well for this type of flow-cytometry data. Even more significant is the fact that experimental evaluations in the testing phase reveal that as the ALL data considered is gradually increased from small to large data sets, the more accurate are the classification results.","['Adjouadi, Malek', 'Ayala, Melvin', 'Cabrerizo, Mercedes', 'Zong, Nuannuan', 'Lizarraga, Gabriel', 'Rossman, Mark']","['Adjouadi M', 'Ayala M', 'Cabrerizo M', 'Zong N', 'Lizarraga G', 'Rossman M']","['Department of Electrical & Computer, Center for Advanced Technology and Education, Florida International University, 10555 W.

CML is derived from the hematopoietic stem cells (1) with the Philadelphia chromosome resulting from of a reciprocal translocation between the chromosomes 9 and 22 t(9;22)-(q34;q11). This translocation produces a fusion gene known as BCR-ABL which acquires uncontrolled tyrosine kinase activity, constantly turning on its downstream signaling molecules/pathways, and promoting proliferation of leukemia cell through anti-apoptosis and acquisition of additional mutations. To evaluate the role of each critical downstream signaling molecule of BCR-ABL and test therapeutic drugs in vivo, it is important to use physiological mouse disease models.

HSPs act as stress signals and regulate natural killer cell response to cancer. HSP70 gene polymorphisms show disease associations partly due to their linkage disequilibrium with HLA alleles. To systematically evaluate their associations with childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), we examined the three functional single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) rs2227956 (T493M) in HSPA1L, rs1043618 in HSPA1A 5'UTR, and rs1061581 (Q351Q) in HSPA1B by TaqMan assays or polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism in 114 ALL cases and 414 controls from Wales (UK), in 100 Mexican Mestizo ALL cases and 253 controls belonging to the same ethnic group, and in a panel of 82 HLA-typed reference cell line samples. Homozygosity for HSPA1B rs1061581 minor allele G was associated with protection (odds ratio (OR) = 0.37, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.16-0.78; P = 0.007) with gene-dosage effect (additive model) reaching significance (P = 0.0001) in the Welsh case-control group. This association was replicated in the second case-control group from Mexico (OR (recessive model) = 0.49, 95% CI = 0.24-0.96; P = 0.03), and the pooled analysis yielded a strong association (Mantel-Haenszel OR = 0.43, 95% CI = 0.27-0.69, P = 0.0004). The association was stronger in males in each group and in the pooled analysis. A three-SNP haplotype including the major allele A of rs1061581 showed a highly significant increase in Welsh cases compared with respective controls (6.7% vs 1.8%; P = 0.0003) due to the difference between male cases and controls. The protective allele of rs1061581 occurred more frequently on the HLA-DRB3 haplotypes (especially DRB1*03) in the cell line panel, but the HSPA1B association was independent from the HLA-DRB4 association previously detected in the same case-control group from Wales (adjusted P = 0.001). Given the cancer promoting roles played by HSPs intracellularly as well as roles in immune surveillance when expressed on the cell surface and the known correlations between expression levels and the HSP polymorphisms, these results are likely to indicate a primary association and warrant detailed assessment in childhood ALL development.","['Ucisik-Akkaya, Esma', 'Davis, Charronne F', 'Gorodezky, Clara', 'Alaez, Carmen', 'Dorak, M Tevfik']","['Ucisik-Akkaya E', 'Davis CF', 'Gorodezky C', 'Alaez C', 'Dorak MT']","['Genomic Immunoepidemiology Laboratory, HUMIGEN LLC, The Institute for Genetic Immunology, 2439 Kuser Road, Hamilton, NJ 08690-3303, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20091209,Netherlands,Cell Stress Chaperones,Cell stress & chaperones,9610925,"['0 (HSP70 Heat-Shock Proteins)', '0 (HSPA1A protein, human)', '0 (HSPA1B protein, human)', '0 (HSPA1L protein, human)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Female', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease/genetics', 'Genotype', 'HSP70 Heat-Shock Proteins/*genetics', 'Haplotypes', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Polymorphism, Restriction Fragment Length/genetics', 'Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide/genetics', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics', 'Sex Factors']",2009/12/17 06:00,2010/12/14 06:00,['2009/12/17 06:00'],"['2009/07/20 00:00 [received]', '2009/11/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/11/14 00:00 [revised]', '2009/12/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/12/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/12/14 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s12192-009-0161-6 [doi]'],ppublish,Cell Stress Chaperones. 2010 Sep;15(5):475-85. doi: 10.1007/s12192-009-0161-6.

In this study, the antioxidant activity of MAG was investigated and the influence of MAG on K562 cells in 5-aminolevulinic acid (ALA)-based PDT is demonstrated. The results showed that MAG could scavenge hydroxyl radical, superoxide anion, and hydrogen peroxide and inhibit the formation of malondialdehyde (MDA), but increase the amounts of singlet oxygen in cell-free systems. MAG inhibits cell proliferation and enhances cell apoptosis, lipid peroxidation, and DNA damage in ALA-PDT on K562 cells. NaN3, a singlet oxygen quencher, suppresses the MAG-induced cell apoptosis, lipid peroxidation, and DNA damage. In conclusion, MAG enhances the PDT-induced cytotoxicity in K562 cells and singlet oxygen was involved in this process.

In particular, Lenalidomide is a structural analogue of thalidomide with similar but more potent biological activity; it is used as first line therapy in MM (Palumbo et al., 2007; Niesvizky et al., 2007), although information regarding its associated use with dexamethasone use as salvage therapy in PCL derives from anecdotal single case reports (Musto et al., 2008). We would like to describe a case of primary PCL with adverse cytogenetic in which excellent response was achieved with the combination of lenalidomide, melphalan, and prednisone as salvage therapy.","['Guglielmelli, Tommasina', 'Merlini, Roberta', 'Giugliano, Emilia', 'Saglio, Giuseppe']","['Guglielmelli T', 'Merlini R', 'Giugliano E', 'Saglio G']","['Department of Clinical and Biological Sciences, San Luigi Hospital, Regione Gonzole 10, Orbassano 10043, Turin, Italy.']",['eng'],['Case Reports'],,Egypt,J Oncol,Journal of oncology,101496537,,,,2009/12/17 06:00,2009/12/17 06:01,['2009/12/17 06:00'],"['2009/04/17 00:00 [received]', '2009/09/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/12/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/12/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2009/12/17 06:01 [medline]']",['10.1155/2009/867380 [doi]'],ppublish,J Oncol. 2009;2009:867380. doi: 10.1155/2009/867380.,2009,,,PMC2786165,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It has been demonstrated that the Wnt signaling pathway is activated in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) cells, and that uncontrolled Wnt/beta-catenin signaling may contribute to the defect in apoptosis that characterizes this malignancy. Thus, the Wnt signaling pathway is an attractive candidate for developing targeted therapies for CLL. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: The diuretic agent ethacrynic acid (EA) was identified as a Wnt inhibitor using a cell-based Wnt reporter assay. In vitro assays further confirmed the inhibitory effect of EA on Wnt/beta-catenin signaling. Cell viability assays showed that EA selectively induced cell death in primary CLL cells. Exposure of CLL cells to EA decreased the expression of Wnt/beta-catenin target genes, including LEF-1, cyclin D1 and fibronectin. Immune co-precipitation experiments demonstrated that EA could directly bind to LEF-1 protein and destabilize the LEF-1/beta-catenin complex. N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC), which can react with the alpha, beta-unsaturated ketone in EA, but not other anti-oxidants, prevented the drug's inhibition of Wnt/beta-catenin activation and its ability to induce apoptosis in CLL cells. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Our studies indicate that EA selectively suppresses CLL survival due to inhibition of Wnt/beta-catenin signaling. Antagonizing Wnt signaling in CLL with EA or related drugs may represent an effective treatment of this disease.","['Lu, Desheng', 'Liu, Jerry X', 'Endo, Tomoyuki', 'Zhou, Haowen', 'Yao, Shiyin', 'Willert, Karl', 'Schmidt-Wolf, Ingo G H', 'Kipps, Thomas J', 'Carson, Dennis A']","['Lu D', 'Liu JX', 'Endo T', 'Zhou H', 'Yao S', 'Willert K', 'Schmidt-Wolf IG', 'Kipps TJ', 'Carson DA']","['Moores Cancer Center, University of California San Diego, La Jolla, California, United States of America. delu@ucsd.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20091214,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (FZD5 protein, human)', '0 (Fibronectins)', '0 (Frizzled Receptors)', '0 (LEF1 protein, human)', '0 (Lymphoid Enhancer-Binding Factor 1)', '0 (Receptors, G-Protein-Coupled)', '0 (Wnt Proteins)', '0 (beta Catenin)', '136601-57-5 (Cyclin D1)', 'M5DP350VZV (Ethacrynic Acid)', 'WYQ7N0BPYC (Acetylcysteine)']",IM,"['Acetylcysteine/pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cyclin D1/genetics/metabolism', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Ethacrynic Acid/*toxicity', 'Fibronectins/genetics/metabolism', 'Frizzled Receptors/genetics/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/genetics/*metabolism/*pathology', 'Lymphoid Enhancer-Binding Factor 1/genetics/metabolism', 'Protein Binding/drug effects', 'Receptors, G-Protein-Coupled/genetics/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/*drug effects', 'Wnt Proteins/*metabolism', 'beta Catenin/*metabolism']",2009/12/17 06:00,2010/03/18 06:00,['2009/12/17 06:00'],"['2009/07/30 00:00 [received]', '2009/11/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/12/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/12/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/03/18 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1371/journal.pone.0008294 [doi]'],epublish,PLoS One. 2009 Dec 14;4(12):e8294. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0008294.,4,"['U19 CA113318/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA081534/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA81534-06/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA113318-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01-CA081534/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,PMC2789382,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Given that the phenotype of Vav1(-/-), Rasgrf2(-/-) and Vav1(-/-);Rasgrf2(-/-) mice has been studied so far in young animals, we decided to explore the long-term consequences of the inactivation of those loci in the immune system. Unexpectedly, our studies revealed that the inactivation of the Vav1 proto-oncogene favors the formation of lymphoblastic lymphoma-like tumors in aging mice. Those tumors, that can be found either localized exclusively inside the thymus or widely disseminated in hematopoietic and non-hematopoietic tissues, are composed of CD3(+) lymphoblasts that display heterogeneous combinations of CD4 and CD8 surface markers. Interestingly, the additional deletion of the Rasgrf2 gene induces a shortening in the latency period for the development of those tumors, an increase in the percentage of disseminated tumors outside the thymus and, as a result, higher mortality rates. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: These data reveal unexpected negative roles for Vav1 and RasGRF2 in different stages of T-cell lymphoma progression. They also suggest that the inactivation of Vav1 function may represent an inadequate strategy to treat T-cell lymphomas, especially those associated with low levels of Rasgrf2 gene expression.","['Ruiz, Sergio', 'Santos, Eugenio', 'Bustelo, Xose R']","['Ruiz S', 'Santos E', 'Bustelo XR']","['Centro de Investigacion del Cancer and Instituto de Biologia Molecular y Celular del Cancer, Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas-University of Salamanca, Salamanca, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20091214,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (MAS1 protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Mas)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-vav)', '0 (RASGRF2 protein, human)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Rasgrf2 protein, mouse)', '0 (VAV1 protein, human)', '0 (Vav1 protein, mouse)', '0 (ras Guanine Nucleotide Exchange Factors)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Down-Regulation/genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/genetics/pathology', 'Lymphoma/*genetics/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Neoplasm Metastasis/genetics/pathology', 'Proto-Oncogene Mas', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-vav/deficiency/*genetics/metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'Thymus Neoplasms/pathology', 'ras Guanine Nucleotide Exchange Factors/deficiency/*genetics/metabolism']",2009/12/17 06:00,2010/03/18 06:00,['2009/12/17 06:00'],"['2009/07/08 00:00 [received]', '2009/11/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/12/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/12/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/03/18 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1371/journal.pone.0008229 [doi]'],epublish,PLoS One. 2009 Dec 14;4(12):e8229. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0008229.,4,"['R01 CA073735/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', '5R01-CA73735-13/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,PMC2788417,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Some proteins act as hub proteins, highly connected to others, whereas some others have few interactions. The dysfunction of some interactions causes many diseases, including cancer. Proteins interact through their interfaces. Therefore, studying the interface properties of cancer-related proteins will help explain their role in the interaction networks. Similar or overlapping binding sites should be used repeatedly in single interface hub proteins, making them promiscuous. Alternatively, multi-interface hub proteins make use of several distinct binding sites to bind to different partners. We propose a methodology to integrate protein interfaces into cancer interaction networks (ciSPIN, cancer structural protein interface network). The interactions in the human protein interaction network are replaced by interfaces, coming from either known or predicted complexes. We provide a detailed analysis of cancer related human protein-protein interfaces and the topological properties of the cancer network. The results reveal that cancer-related proteins have smaller, more planar, more charged and less hydrophobic binding sites than non-cancer proteins, which may indicate low affinity and high specificity of the cancer-related interactions. We also classified the genes in ciSPIN according to phenotypes. Within phenotypes, for breast cancer, colorectal cancer and leukemia, interface properties were found to be discriminating from non-cancer interfaces with an accuracy of 71%, 67%, 61%, respectively. In addition, cancer-related proteins tend to interact with their partners through distinct interfaces, corresponding mostly to multi-interface hubs, which comprise 56% of cancer-related proteins, and constituting the nodes with higher essentiality in the network (76%). We illustrate the interface related affinity properties of two cancer-related hub proteins: Erbb3, a multi interface, and Raf1, a single interface hub. The results reveal that affinity of interactions of the multi-interface hub tends to be higher than that of the single-interface hub. These findings might be important in obtaining new targets in cancer as well as finding the details of specific binding regions of putative cancer drug candidates.","['Kar, Gozde', 'Gursoy, Attila', 'Keskin, Ozlem']","['Kar G', 'Gursoy A', 'Keskin O']","['Center for Computational Biology and Bioinformatics and College of Engineering, Koc University, Rumeli Feneri Yolu, Sariyer Istanbul, Turkey.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20091211,United States,PLoS Comput Biol,PLoS computational biology,101238922,['0 (Proteins)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Binding Sites', 'Computational Biology/*methods', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Hydrophobic and Hydrophilic Interactions', 'Models, Molecular', 'Neoplasms/*chemistry/drug therapy/*metabolism', 'Protein Binding', '*Protein Interaction Domains and Motifs', 'Proteins/*analysis/chemistry/genetics/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction']",2009/12/17 06:00,2010/02/17 06:00,['2009/12/17 06:00'],"['2009/06/03 00:00 [received]', '2009/11/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/12/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/12/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/02/17 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000601 [doi]'],ppublish,PLoS Comput Biol. 2009 Dec;5(12):e1000601. doi: 10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000601.

The proliferation of K562 cells and their cytotoxicity were evaluated by MTT assay. Cell apoptosis was observed and analyzed by microscope and flow cytometry, respectively. Furthermore, real-time polymerase chain reaction and Western blotting analyses were performed to examine gene transcription and protein expression, respectively. The results showed that MNPs-Fe(3)O(4) dramatically enhanced GA-induced cytotoxicity and apoptosis in K562 cells. The typical morphological features of apoptosis treated with GA and MNPs-Fe(3)O(4) were observed under an optical microscope and a fluorescence microscope, respectively. The transcription of caspase-3 and bax gene in the group treated with GA and MNPs-Fe(3)O(4) was higher than that in the GA-alone group or MNPs-Fe(3)O(4)-alone group, but the transcription of bcl-2, nuclear factor-kappaB, and survivin degraded as did the expression of corresponding proteins in K562 cells.

A quantitative assessment of bias was also carried out. Potential sources of selection bias were found in all the studies, but none of them were observed across all the studies. Main sources of potential bias were a non-concurrent selection of controls with respect to cases, the use of control diagnoses possibly caused by pesticide exposure in hospital-based studies, and non-participation of selected eligible subjects. A quantitative assessment of bias concluded that non-participation alone could not explain the reported positive associations. We conclude that overall, selection bias, as a likely source of bias in these studies, does not seem to explain their positive findings.

Chromosomal losses accounted for the majority of genomic imbalances. All 22 cell lines examined showed homozygous deletions of 9p21.3, centering at the CDKN2A/ARF and CDKN2B loci. Other commonly underrepresented segments included 1p36, 1p22, 3p21-22, 4q13, 4q34, 11q23, 13q12-13, 14q32, 15q15, 18q12, and 22q12, each observed in 55-90% of cell lines. Focal deletions of 11q23 encompassed the transcriptional repressor gene promyelocytic leukemia zinc finger (PLZF), which was validated by analysis of genomic DNA using real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Semi-quantitative RT-PCR and immunoblot analysis revealed that PLZF is greatly downregulated in MM cell lines compared with non-malignant mesothelial cells. Ectopic expression of PLZF in PLZF-deficient MM cells resulted in decreased cell viability, reduced colony formation, as well as increased apoptosis, the latter based on results of various cell death assays and the observation of increased cleavage of caspase 3, PARP, and Mcl-1. These data indicate that deletions of PLZF are a common occurrence in MM and that downregulation of PLZF may contribute to MM pathogenesis by promoting cell survival.","['Cheung, M', 'Pei, J', 'Pei, Y', 'Jhanwar, S C', 'Pass, H I', 'Testa, J R']","['Cheung M', 'Pei J', 'Pei Y', 'Jhanwar SC', 'Pass HI', 'Testa JR']","['Cancer Genetics and Signaling Program, Fox Chase Cancer Center, Philadelphia, PA 19111-2497, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20091214,England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (CDKN2B protein, human)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p15)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p16)', '0 (Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Zinc Finger Protein)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p14ARF)', '147855-37-6 (ZBTB16 protein, human)', 'EC 2.4.2.30 (Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/genetics/physiology', 'Blotting, Western', 'Caspase 3/metabolism', 'Cell Cycle/genetics/physiology', 'Cell Survival/genetics/physiology', '*Chromosome Deletion', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 9/*genetics', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p15/genetics', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p16/genetics', '*Down-Regulation', 'Gene Dosage', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors/*genetics/metabolism', 'Mesothelioma/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases/metabolism', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Zinc Finger Protein', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p14ARF/genetics']",2009/12/17 06:00,2010/04/24 06:00,['2009/12/17 06:00'],"['2009/12/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/12/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/04/24 06:00 [medline]']","['onc2009455 [pii]', '10.1038/onc.2009.455 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2010 Mar 18;29(11):1633-40. doi: 10.1038/onc.2009.455.

The development of specific markers for identification of the CSCs may lead to new diagnostic strategies of PCa. Increased aldehyde dehydrogenase 1A1 (ALDH1A1) activity has been found in the stem cell populations of leukemia and some solid tumors. The aim of the study was to investigate the stem-cell-related function and clinical significance of the ALDH1A1 in human PCa. ALDEFLUOR assay was used to isolate ALDH1A1(+) cells from PCa cell lines. Stem cell characteristics of the ALDH1A1(+) cells were then investigated by in vitro and in vivo approaches. The ALDH1A1 expression was also analyzed by immunohistochemistry in 18 normal prostate and 163 PCa tissues. The ALDH1A1(+) PCa cells showed high clonogenic and tumorigenic capacities, and serially reinitiated transplantable tumors that resembled histopathologic characteristics and heterogeneity of the parental PCa cells in mice. Immunohistochemical analysis of human prostate tissues showed that ALDH1A1(+) cells were sparse and limited to the basal component in normal prostates. However, in tumor specimens, increased ALDH1A1 immunopositivity was found not only in secretory type cancer epithelial cells but also in neuroendocrine tumor populations. Furthermore, the high ALDH1A1 expression in PCa was positively correlated with Gleason score (P=0.01) and pathologic stage (P=0.01), and inversely associated with overall survival and cancer-specific survival of the patients (P=0.00093 and 0.00017, respectively). ALDH1A1 could be a prostate CSC-related marker.

All leukemogenic MLL fusion proteins retain the CXXC domain, which binds to nonmethylated CpG DNA sites. We present the solution structure of the MLL CXXC domain in complex with DNA, showing how the CXXC domain distinguishes nonmethylated from methylated CpG DNA. On the basis of the structure, we generated point mutations that disrupt DNA binding. Introduction of these mutations into the MLL-AF9 fusion protein resulted in increased DNA methylation of specific CpG nucleotides in Hoxa9, increased H3K9 methylation, decreased expression of Hoxa9-locus transcripts, loss of immortalization potential, and inability to induce leukemia in mice. These results establish that DNA binding by the CXXC domain and protection against DNA methylation is essential for MLL fusion leukemia. They also provide support for viewing this interaction as a potential target for therapeutic intervention.","['Cierpicki, Tomasz', 'Risner, Laurie E', 'Grembecka, Jolanta', 'Lukasik, Stephen M', 'Popovic, Relja', 'Omonkowska, Monika', 'Shultis, David D', 'Zeleznik-Le, Nancy J', 'Bushweller, John H']","['Cierpicki T', 'Risner LE', 'Grembecka J', 'Lukasik SM', 'Popovic R', 'Omonkowska M', 'Shultis DD', 'Zeleznik-Le NJ', 'Bushweller JH']","['Department of Molecular Physiology and Biological Physics, University of Virginia, Charlottesville, Virginia, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20091213,United States,Nat Struct Mol Biol,Nature structural & molecular biology,101186374,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (Mllt3 protein, mouse)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (homeobox protein HOXA9)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Kmt2a protein, mouse)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Chromatin Immunoprecipitation', 'DNA/*metabolism', 'DNA Methylation/*genetics', 'DNA Primers/genetics', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase', 'Homeodomain Proteins/metabolism', 'Leukemia/*genetics', 'Mice', '*Models, Molecular', 'Mutagenesis', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/*chemistry/metabolism', 'Nuclear Magnetic Resonance, Biomolecular', 'Nuclear Proteins/*metabolism', '*Protein Conformation', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Survival Analysis']",2009/12/17 06:00,2010/03/03 06:00,['2009/12/17 06:00'],"['2009/01/25 00:00 [received]', '2009/10/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/12/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/12/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/03/03 06:00 [medline]']","['nsmb.1714 [pii]', '10.1038/nsmb.1714 [doi]']",ppublish,Nat Struct Mol Biol. 2010 Jan;17(1):62-8. doi: 10.1038/nsmb.1714.

Leukemogenic oncoproteins block differentiation by subverting the normal transcriptional status of hematopoietic precursor cells. Pirin (PIR) is a putative transcriptional regulator whose expression is silenced in cells bearing the acute myeloid leukemia-1 eight-twenty-one (AML1/ETO) and promyelocytic leukemia/retinoic acid receptor (PML/RAR) leukemogenic fusion proteins. A role for PIR in myeloid differentiation has not to date been reported. In this study we show that PIR expression is significantly repressed in a large proportion of acute myeloid leukemias (AMLs), regardless of subtype or underlying karyotypic abnormalities. We show that PIR expression increases during in vitro myeloid differentiation of primary hematopoietic precursor cells, and that ablation of PIR in the U937 myelomonocytic cell line or in murine primary hematopoietic precursor cells results in impairment of terminal myeloid differentiation. Gene expression profiling of U937 cells after knockdown of PIR revealed increased expression of genes associated with the early phases of hematopoiesis, in particular, homeobox A (HOXA) genes. Our results suggest that PIR is required for terminal myeloid maturation, and its downregulation may contribute to the differentiation arrest associated with AML.","['Licciulli, S', 'Cambiaghi, V', 'Scafetta, G', 'Gruszka, A M', 'Alcalay, M']","['Licciulli S', 'Cambiaghi V', 'Scafetta G', 'Gruszka AM', 'Alcalay M']","['Department of Experimental Oncology, Istituto Europeo di Oncologia, Milan, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20091210,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', 'EC 1.13.11.- (Dioxygenases)', 'EC 1.13.11.- (PIR protein, human)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Animals', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/genetics/metabolism', 'Blotting, Western', 'Bone Marrow/metabolism/pathology', 'Carrier Proteins/*genetics/*metabolism', '*Cell Differentiation', 'Dioxygenases', 'Down-Regulation', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Profiling', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/metabolism/*pathology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Middle Aged', 'Nuclear Proteins/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'RNA, Small Interfering/pharmacology', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'U937 Cells', 'Young Adult']",2009/12/17 06:00,2010/03/12 06:00,['2009/12/17 06:00'],"['2009/12/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/12/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/03/12 06:00 [medline]']","['leu2009247 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2009.247 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2010 Feb;24(2):429-37. doi: 10.1038/leu.2009.247.

The event-free survival improved significantly (P=0.003) from the first two trials conducted in the 1980s to the three more recent trials conducted in the 1990s. Approximately 75% of patients treated in the 1980s and 80% in the 1990s were cured. Early intensive triple intrathecal therapy, together with more effective systemic therapy, including consolidation and reinduction treatment (Studies 13A and 13B) as well as dexamethasone (Study 13B), resulted in a very low rate of isolated central nervous system (CNS) relapse rate (<2%), despite the reduced use of cranial irradiation.

METHODS: Cytotoxic effects of methotrexate, azaserine and 5-fluorouracil were estimated by accessing the lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activity of viable tumor cells. Proteins of FCS were separated using two-dimensional electrophoresis followed by mass spectrometry analysis. RESULTS: Addition of 10% FCS attenuated anti-tumor activity of methotrexate and azaserine against K-562 cells compared with serum-free medium. Such an activity of FCS was different for each serum lot. Comparison of the proteins in active serum lot with those in not active one using two-dimensional electrophoresis showed that in the active serum there were proteins 150 kDa, which were absent in the not active serum lot. Mass spectrometry indicated that all those proteins had the amino acid sequence of albumin. Sera of one healthy volunteer and two patients with thyroid cancer also attenuated the activity of the agent. CONCLUSION: Several lots of FCS and human serum demonstrated the ability to attenuate the cytotoxic effect of methotrexate in vitro, possibly due to the formation of albumin dimers/MTX complexes.","['Kojima, T', 'Hashimoto, Y', 'Inamura, Y', 'Koide, T', 'Nagata, H', 'Ito, N', 'Suzumura, K']","['Kojima T', 'Hashimoto Y', 'Inamura Y', 'Koide T', 'Nagata H', 'Ito N', 'Suzumura K']","['Department of Surgery, Aichi-Gakuin University School of Dentistry, Nagoya-City, Aichi 464-8651, Japan. taku@dpc.aichi-gakuin.ac.jp']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Ukraine,Exp Oncol,Experimental oncology,101230541,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Culture Media)', '0 (Culture Media, Serum-Free)', '0 (Serum Albumin)', '87299V3Q9W (Azaserine)', 'U3P01618RT (Fluorouracil)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/*pharmacology', 'Azaserine/pharmacology', 'Cell Culture Techniques/*methods', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Culture Media/*chemistry/pharmacology', 'Culture Media, Serum-Free/pharmacology', 'Electrophoresis, Gel, Two-Dimensional', 'Fluorouracil/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Mass Spectrometry', 'Methotrexate/*pharmacology', '*Serum', 'Serum Albumin/pharmacology']",2009/12/17 06:00,2010/03/10 06:00,['2009/12/17 06:00'],"['2009/12/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/12/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/03/10 06:00 [medline]']",['41/784 [pii]'],ppublish,Exp Oncol. 2009 Dec;31(4):209-13.,31,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Patients classified with higher-risk disease include those with intermediate-2 or high-risk disease as classified by the International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS). These patients represent 29% of the MDS population and were originally reported to have a median survival without therapy of only 0.4 for high-risk patients and 1.1 years for intermediate-2 risk patients. The most significant treatment goals in these patients involve prolonging the time to acute myeloid leukemia progression and extending overall survival. Quality of life, symptom control, and transfusion independence are also important. The National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines divide treatment options for this population into high- and low-intensity therapies. High-intensity therapies include cytarabine-based remission induction chemotherapy and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Transplantation is the only treatment option with the ability to cure; however, many MDS patients may not qualify due to age or comorbidities. Low-intensity therapies include the DNA methyltransferase inhibitors azacitidine and decitabine. Recently, azacitidine demonstrated the ability to extend survival by as much as 74% despite a modest complete response rate.

Typically, HES has a benign course and glucocorticosteroids suffice to achieve remission. In chronic myeloid neoplasm with eosinophilia and abnormalities of PDGFRA the FIP1L1-PDGFRA fusion gene can be detected. Its product is a protein showing tyrosine kinase activity leading to malignant proliferation of eosinophil precursors. Differential diagnosis of HES is often difficult because hypereosinophilia may also be reactive and may occur in many nonhematological as well as hematological disorders. Thus, reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)is indicated in all patients with HES in order to detect the FIP1L1-PDGFRA transcript. Traditional treatment of chronic myeloid neoplasm with cytostatic drugs results in a short-term and transient remission or stabilization of the disease. We present the case of a 52-year-old patient with chronic myeloid neoplasm with eosinophilia and abnormalities of PDGFRA, in whom acceleration occurred after a year of cytostatic therapy with hydroxyurea and was successfully treated with imatinib. It was impossible to unequivocally determine the type of bone marrow disease based on histologic criteria, and a wide spectrum of molecular tests differentiating the type of myeloid proliferation were necessary to establish the diagnosis. RT-PCR did not reveal BCR-ABL or JAK2 V617F mutation. Further molecular testing showed rearrangement involving the FIP1L1 gene, thus enabling implementation of targeted therapy.","['Rodzaj, Marek', 'Galazka, Krystyna', 'Majewski, Miroslaw', 'Zdunczyk, Andrzej']","['Rodzaj M', 'Galazka K', 'Majewski M', 'Zdunczyk A']","['Department of Hematology and Internal Diseases, Rydygier Hospital, Krakow, Poland. rodzaj@mp.pl']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",,Poland,Pol Arch Med Wewn,Polskie Archiwum Medycyny Wewnetrznej,0401225,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (mRNA Cleavage and Polyadenylation Factors)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FIP1L1-PDGFRA fusion protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor, Platelet-Derived Growth Factor alpha)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage', 'Benzamides', 'Disease Progression', 'Gene Rearrangement', 'Humans', 'Hypereosinophilic Syndrome/*diagnosis/*drug therapy/genetics', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*diagnosis/*drug therapy/genetics', 'Middle Aged', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*metabolism', 'Piperazines/*administration & dosage', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/administration & dosage', 'Pyrimidines/*administration & dosage', 'Receptor, Platelet-Derived Growth Factor alpha/*metabolism', 'mRNA Cleavage and Polyadenylation Factors/*metabolism']",2009/12/17 06:00,2010/05/07 06:00,['2009/12/17 06:00'],"['2009/12/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/12/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/05/07 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Pol Arch Med Wewn. 2009 Dec;119(12):838-41.,119,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

OBJECTIVES: The aim of the study was to evaluate the frequency of BCR-ABL gene mutations in patients with CML (the MAPTEST study) treated with imatinib (IM). PATIENTS AND METHODS: Direct sequencing analysis of BCR-ABL gene was performed in 92 patients treated with IM for more than 3 months. The mean time of IM treatment was 18 months. At the time of the analysis, 75 patients were in the first chronic phase (CP), 4 in the second CP, 5 in the acceleration and 8 in the blastic phase. Fifty-seven patients (62%) were treated with IM at a daily dose of 400 mg and 35 patients with higher doses (600 or 800 mg daily). Inclusion criteria were based on the European Leukemia Net definitions for failure and suboptimal response to IM. RESULTS: Twelve mutations were detected in 11 of 92 patients, including 4 mutations (36.7%) diagnosed during CP, 3 (27.3%) in acceleration, and 4 (36.7%) in blast crisis. In 1 patient with lymphoid blast crisis of CML coexisting F359V and Y253F mutations were detected. In the whole group mutations were detected in 2 of 5 patients (40%) with primary resistance (M351T, F359V + Y253F) and in 9 of 87 patients (10.3%) (E255K, T315I-3x, M351T, E355G, F359V-2x) with acquired resistance to IM.

Cutaneous presentation in pre-T ALL is highly unusual. We describe a case of pre-T ALL presenting as 2 papulonodular lesions on the face of an otherwise asymptomatic 27-year-old man. Microscopic examination of both lesions revealed a moderate to dense pandermal infiltrate of medium-sized lymphocytes with extensive ""crush"" artifact, whereas immunohistochemistry revealed positive staining of lesional cells for CD45, CD3, Bcl-2, Ki-67, CD5, CD7, and CD34 but negative staining for CD4, CD8, CD30, CD56, CD10, CD117, anaplastic lymphoma kinase protein, TdT, myeloperoxidase, CD79a, and CD20. Gene rearrangement studies performed on both biopsies identified a clonal population of T lymphocytes. A subsequent computed tomography scan revealed a 9-cm mediastinal mass encasing all major mediastinal vessels, whereas a bone marrow biopsy revealed blasts with an immunophenotype similar to that of the cutaneous lesions.

NK cells do not mediate and may diminish graft versus host disease. Here we review the determinants of NK cell alloreactivity and their implications for adoptive NK cell therapy. RECENT FINDINGS: NK cell alloreactivity has been defined by the absence of recipient MHC class I ligands for donor inhibitory killer immunoglobulin-like receptor (KIR) receptors, as predicted by a number of algorithms. Recently, the role of activating NK receptors and their cognate ligands has received more attention. The beneficial clinical effect of NK-cell alloreactivity has not been uniformly demonstrated, likely reflecting differences in conditioning regimens, graft components and posttransplant immune suppression. Investigations of NK cell phenotype and function after transplantation have helped demonstrate which NK cell subsets mediate the graft versus leukemia effect. These advances have proceeded in parallel with increasing facility in GMP-grade bulk purification and administration of NK cell preparations. SUMMARY: NK cells are a heterogeneous population of lymphocytes with diverse patterns of target-cell recognition and effector function. Further clinical and functional correlations will help maximize their potential for clinical benefit.","['Benjamin, Jonathan E', 'Gill, Saar', 'Negrin, Robert S']","['Benjamin JE', 'Gill S', 'Negrin RS']","['Division of Blood and Marrow Transplantation, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, California, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",,United States,Curr Opin Oncol,Current opinion in oncology,9007265,,IM,"['Clinical Trials as Topic', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*immunology/*transplantation', 'Transplantation, Homologous/*immunology']",2009/12/17 06:00,2010/04/28 06:00,['2009/12/17 06:00'],"['2009/12/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/12/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/04/28 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1097/CCO.0b013e328335a559 [doi]'],ppublish,Curr Opin Oncol. 2010 Mar;22(2):130-7. doi: 10.1097/CCO.0b013e328335a559.,22,"['P01 CA049605/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA125276/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA125276-03/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01-CA-125276/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,PMC2880497,['NIHMS205204'],83,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here we describe a patient with post-transplant relapse of Ph(+)ALL, who has remained in complete remission (CR) for 30 months after relapse. A 55-year-old woman with Ph(+)ALL received allo-HSCT from an unrelated donor during first CR. The conditioning regimen consisted of fludarabine+melphalan, and graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis consisted of tacrolimus and short-term methotrexate. She achieved and maintained molecular remission without developing GVHD after transplantation, but suffered a hematologic relapse on day 871. She received imatinib-combined chemotherapy, and again achieved molecular remission. Since the completion of imatinib-combined chemotherapy, she has been receiving imatinib monotherapy. Although it has been reported that chemotherapy and imatinib are effective only transiently in patients with relapsed Ph(+)ALL, our patient has remained in molecular remission for 30 months after post-transplant relapse at the time of this report. Our case suggests that by continuing imatinib after the induction of molecular remission by imatinib-combined chemotherapy, the antileukemic activity of imatinib could achieve durable remission in combination with the graft-versus-leukemia effect.

This phase I study of radioimmunotherapy used CHT-25, a chimeric antibody to the alpha-chain of the interleukin-2 receptor, CD25, conjugated to iodine-131 ((131)I) in patients with refractory CD25-positive lymphomas. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Fifteen patients were treated (Hodgkin lymphoma, 12; angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma, 1; adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma, 2). Tumor was monitored by computed tomography and in all but two patients by (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography. RESULTS: There were no grade 3 or 4 infusion reactions. At the maximum tolerated dose of 1,200 MBq/m(2), the major side effect was delayed myelotoxicity with the nadir for platelets at 38 days and for neutrophils at 53 days. One patient treated with 2,960 MBq/m(2) developed prolonged grade 4 neutropenia and thrombocytopenia and died of Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia. Nonhematologic toxicity was mild. Single photon emission computer tomography imaging showed tumor-specific uptake and retention of (131)I and no excessive retention in normal organs. Of nine patients receiving >/=1,200 MBq/m(2), six responded (three complete response and three partial response); one of six patients with administered radioactivity of </=740 MBq/m(2) had a complete response. CONCLUSIONS: CHT-25 is well tolerated with 1,200 MBq/m(2) administered radioactivity and shows clinical activity in patients who are refractory to conventional therapies. Phase II studies are justified to determine efficacy and toxicity in a broader range of clinical scenarios.

Impressive clinical responses are obtained in the majority of patients in chronic phase; however, not all patients experience an optimal response to imatinib, and furthermore, the clinical response in a number of patients will not be sustained. The process by which the leukemic cells prove resistant to TKIs and the restoration of BCR-ABL1 signal transduction from previous inhibition has initiated the pursuit for the causal mechanisms of resistance and strategies by which to surmount resistance to therapeutic intervention. ABL kinase domain mutations have been extensively implicated in the pathogenesis of TKI resistance, however, it is increasingly evident that the presence of mutations does not explain all cases of resistance and does not account for the failure of TKIs to eliminate minimal residual disease in patients who respond optimally. The focus of exploring TKI resistance has expanded to include the mechanism by which the drug is delivered to its target and the impact of drug influx and efflux proteins on TKI bioavailability.

Single nucleotide polymorphisms were genotyped in 24 F1 generation and 290 F2 generation birds. Four SNP were identified in the lymphotactin gene, 12 were located in the TCR-beta gene, and 4 in the MLF2 gene. At various times after experimental infection of the F2 generation with Eimeria maxima, BW, fecal oocyst shedding, and biochemical parameters were measured as parameters of coccidiosis resistance. Single marker association test was applied to determine the associations between the 20 SNP and the parameters of coccidiosis resistance. The maximum additive genetic effect on disease resistance of an SNP in MLF2 was explained by BW (P = 0.0002). The SNP in MLF2 significantly associated with BW was also associated with fecal oocyst shedding (P = 0.001). Four SNP associated with oocyst shedding were found within the coding region of TCR-beta (P < 0.05). Although none of the lymphotactin SNP were associated with oocyst shedding, interferon-gamma level was associated with 2 SNP in lymphotactin. These results suggest that the SNP in the MLF2 gene can be one of the markers to select coccidiosis resistance in chickens.","['Kim, E-S', 'Hong, Y H', 'Lillehoj, H S']","['Kim ES', 'Hong YH', 'Lillehoj HS']","['Bovine Functional Genomics Laboratory, Animal and Natural Resources Institute, USDA, Beltsville, MD 20705, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",,England,Poult Sci,Poultry science,0401150,"['0 (Genetic Markers)', '0 (Nitrates)', '0 (Nitrites)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, alpha-beta)', '36-88-4 (Carotenoids)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Body Weight/genetics', 'Carotenoids', 'Chickens/*genetics', 'Coccidiosis/genetics/*veterinary', 'Female', 'Genetic Markers', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genotype', 'Interferon-gamma', 'Male', 'Nitrates', 'Nitrites', 'Nuclear Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide/genetics', 'Poultry Diseases/*genetics', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, alpha-beta/*genetics/metabolism']",2009/12/17 06:00,2010/02/25 06:00,['2009/12/17 06:00'],"['2009/12/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/12/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/02/25 06:00 [medline]']","['S0032-5791(19)42401-2 [pii]', '10.3382/ps.2009-00351 [doi]']",ppublish,Poult Sci. 2010 Jan;89(1):20-7. doi: 10.3382/ps.2009-00351.,89,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Their reactivity is governed by a balance of activating and inhibitory receptors including various members of the tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNFR) family. Here we report that human NK cells acquire expression of the TNFR family member CD137 upon activation, and NK cells of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients display an activated phenotype with substantial CD137 expression. CD137 ligand (CD137L) was detectable on leukemic cells in 35% of 65 investigated AML patients, but not on healthy CD34(+) cells, and expression was associated with monocytic differentiation. Bidirectional signaling following CD137-CD137L interaction induced the release of the immunomodulatory cytokines interleukin-10 and TNF by AML cells and directly diminished granule mobilization, cytotoxicity, and interferon-gamma production of human NK cells, which was restored by blocking CD137. Cocultures of NK cells with CD137L transfectants confirmed that human CD137 inhibits NK-cell reactivity, while activating signals were transduced by its counterpart on NK cells in mice. Our data underline the necessity to study the function of seemingly analog immunoregulatory molecules in mice compared with men and demonstrate that CD137-CD137L interaction enables immune evasion of AML cells by impairing NK-cell tumor surveillance in humans.","['Baessler, Tina', 'Charton, Jean Enno', 'Schmiedel, Benjamin Joachim', 'Grunebach, Frank', 'Krusch, Matthias', 'Wacker, Alexander', 'Rammensee, Hans-Georg', 'Salih, Helmut Rainer']","['Baessler T', 'Charton JE', 'Schmiedel BJ', 'Grunebach F', 'Krusch M', 'Wacker A', 'Rammensee HG', 'Salih HR']","['Department of Hematology/Oncology, Eberhard-Karls University, 72076 Tuebingen, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20091214,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (4-1BB Ligand)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Histocompatibility Antigens Class I)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor Receptor Superfamily, Member 9)']",IM,"['4-1BB Ligand/genetics/*immunology', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Animals', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cytokines/metabolism', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Histocompatibility Antigens Class I/immunology', 'Humans', 'Immune Tolerance/immunology', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*immunology/pathology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/*immunology/pathology', 'Lymphocyte Activation/immunology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Middle Aged', 'Protein Binding', 'Signal Transduction/immunology', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor Receptor Superfamily, Member 9/metabolism', 'Up-Regulation/genetics']",2009/12/17 06:00,2010/05/01 06:00,['2009/12/17 06:00'],"['2009/12/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/12/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/05/01 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)56494-X [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2009-06-227934 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2010 Apr 15;115(15):3058-69. doi: 10.1182/blood-2009-06-227934.

Here we show that maintenance of Runx1(-/-) HSCs is compromised, progressively resulting in HSC exhaustion. In leukemia development, the stem cell exhaustion was rescued by additional genetic changes. Retroviral insertional mutagenesis revealed Evi5 activation as a cooperating genetic alteration and EVI5 overexpression indeed prevented Runx1(-/-) HSC exhaustion in mice. Moreover, EVI5 was frequently overexpressed in human RUNX1-related leukemias.

Slp65-deficient mice spontaneously develop pre-B cell leukemia, but the mechanism by which Slp65(-/-) pre-B cells become malignant is unknown. Loss of Btk, a Tec-family kinase that cooperates with Slp65 as a tumor suppressor, synergizes with deregulation of the c-Myc oncogene during lymphoma formation. Here, we report that the presence of the immunoglobulin heavy chain transgene V(H)81X prevented tumor development in Btk(-/-)Slp65(-/-) mice. This finding paralleled the reported effect of a human immunoglobulin heavy chain transgene on lymphoma development in Emu-myc mice, expressing transgenic c-Myc. Because activation of c-Myc strongly selects for spontaneous inactivation of the p19(Arf)-Mdm2-p53 tumor suppressor pathway, we investigated whether disruption of this pathway is a common alteration in Slp65(-/-) pre-B cell tumors. We found that combined loss of Slp65 and p53 in mice transformed pre-B cells very efficiently. Aberrations in p19(Arf), Mdm2, or p53 expression were found in all Slp65(-/-) (n = 17) and Btk(-/-)Slp65(-/-) (n = 32) pre-B cell leukemias analyzed. In addition, 9 of 10 p53(-/-)Slp65(-/-) pre-B cell leukemias manifested significant Mdm2 protein expression.

However, the exact role of AKT activation in leukemia and its effects on hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) are poorly understood. Several members of the PI3K pathway, phosphatase and tensin homolog (Pten), the forkhead box, subgroup O (FOXO) transcription factors, and TSC1, have demonstrated functions in normal and leukemic stem cells but are rarely mutated in leukemia. We developed an activated allele of AKT1 that models increased signaling in normal and leukemic stem cells. In our murine bone marrow transplantation model using a myristoylated AKT1 (myr-AKT), recipients develop myeloproliferative disease, T-cell lymphoma, or AML. Analysis of the HSCs in myr-AKT mice reveals transient expansion and increased cycling, associated with impaired engraftment. myr-AKT-expressing bone marrow cells are unable to form cobblestones in long-term cocultures. Rapamycin, an inhibitor of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) rescues cobblestone formation in myr-AKT-expressing bone marrow cells and increases the survival of myr-AKT mice. This study demonstrates that enhanced AKT activation is an important mechanism of transformation in AML and that HSCs are highly sensitive to excess AKT/mTOR signaling.","['Kharas, Michael G', 'Okabe, Rachel', 'Ganis, Jared J', 'Gozo, Maricel', 'Khandan, Tulasi', 'Paktinat, Mahnaz', 'Gilliland, D Gary', 'Gritsman, Kira']","['Kharas MG', 'Okabe R', 'Ganis JJ', 'Gozo M', 'Khandan T', 'Paktinat M', 'Gilliland DG', 'Gritsman K']","[""Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, MA 02115, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20091214,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', 'EC 2.7.1.1 (MTOR protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.1.1 (mTOR protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'W36ZG6FT64 (Sirolimus)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/pharmacology', 'Bone Marrow Cells/cytology', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Cell Division/physiology', 'Cell Line', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*cytology/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/metabolism', 'Kidney/cytology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/*metabolism/*pathology', 'Lymphoma, T-Cell/drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/*metabolism', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects/physiology', 'Sirolimus/pharmacology', 'Spleen/cytology', 'TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases']",2009/12/17 06:00,2010/03/27 06:00,['2009/12/17 06:00'],"['2009/12/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/12/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/03/27 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)56752-9 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2009-06-229443 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2010 Feb 18;115(7):1406-15. doi: 10.1182/blood-2009-06-229443.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: We performed a retrospective multicenter analysis of 1,333 MDS patients age 50 years or older who received transplantation within the EBMT since 1998. The median recipient age was 56 years, with 884 patients (66%) age 50 to 60 years and 449 (34%) patients older than 60 years. There were 811 HLA-matched sibling (61%) and 522 (39%) unrelated donor transplants. Five hundred patients (38%) received standard myeloablative conditioning (SMC), and 833 (62%) received reduced intensity conditioning (RIC). RESULTS: The 4-year estimate for overall survival of the whole cohort was 31%. On multivariate analysis, use of RIC (hazard ratio [HR], 1.44; 95% CI, 1.13 to 1.84; P < .01) and advanced disease stage at transplantation (HR, 1.51; 95% CI, 1.18 to 1.93; P < .01) were associated with an increased relapse rate. In contrast, advanced disease stage at transplantation (HR, 1.43; 95% CI, 1.13 to 1.79; P = .01), use of an unrelated donor (P = .03), and RIC (HR, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.65 to 0.97; P = .03) were independent variables associated with nonrelapse mortality. Advanced disease stage at transplantation (HR, 1.55; 95% CI, 1.32 to 1.83; P < .01) was the major independent variable associated with an inferior 4-year overall survival. CONCLUSION: Allogeneic hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation remains a potential curative therapeutic option for many older patients with MDS. In this analysis, disease stage at time of transplantation, but not recipient age or the intensity of the conditioning regimens, was the most important factor influencing outcomes.","['Lim, Ziyi', 'Brand, Ronald', 'Martino, Rodrigo', 'van Biezen, Anja', 'Finke, Jurgen', 'Bacigalupo, Andrea', 'Beelen, Dietrich', 'Devergie, Agnes', 'Alessandrino, Emilio', 'Willemze, Roel', 'Ruutu, Tapani', 'Boogaerts, Marc', 'Falda, Michele', 'Jouet, Jean-Pierre', 'Niederwieser, Dietger', 'Kroger, Nicolaus', 'Mufti, Ghulam J', 'De Witte, Theo M']","['Lim Z', 'Brand R', 'Martino R', 'van Biezen A', 'Finke J', 'Bacigalupo A', 'Beelen D', 'Devergie A', 'Alessandrino E', 'Willemze R', 'Ruutu T', 'Boogaerts M', 'Falda M', 'Jouet JP', 'Niederwieser D', 'Kroger N', 'Mufti GJ', 'De Witte TM']","['Department of Haematological Medicine, Kings College London and Kings College Hospital, Denmark Hill, London, United Kingdom. ziyi.lim@kcl.ac.uk']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",20091214,United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,,IM,"['Age Factors', 'Aged', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*therapy', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*therapy', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",2009/12/17 06:00,2010/02/05 06:00,['2009/12/17 06:00'],"['2009/12/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/12/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/02/05 06:00 [medline]']","['JCO.2009.21.8073 [pii]', '10.1200/JCO.2009.21.8073 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2010 Jan 20;28(3):405-11. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2009.21.8073.

We conducted a phase I study of flavopiridol, fludarabine, and rituximab (FFR) in patients with mantle-cell lymphoma (MCL), indolent B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (B-NHL), and CLL to determine the activity of FFR. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Therapy included fludarabine 25 mg/m(2) intravenously (IV) days 1 to 5 and rituximab 375 mg/m(2) day 1 every 28 days for 6 cycles. We administered flavopiridol 50 mg/m(2) by 1-hour IV bolus (IVB) day 1 (n = 15); day 1 to 2 (n = 6); 20 mg/m(2) 30-minute IVB + 20 mg/m(2) 4-hour IV infusion (n = 3); or 30 mg/m(2) + 30 mg/m(2) (n = 14). RESULTS: Thirty-eight patients (median age, 62 years) with MCL (n = 10); indolent B-NHL including follicular (n = 9), marginal zone (n = 4), lymphoplasmacytic (n = 1), or small lymphocytic lymphoma (n = 3); and CLL (n = 11), were enrolled. Twenty-two patients were previously untreated; 16 had received one to two prior therapies. Two patients in cohort 2 developed grade 3 dose-limiting toxicity (seizures, renal insufficiency). The median number of treatment cycles was 4, with cytopenias (n = 10) and fatigue (n = 3) the most common reasons for early discontinuation. Overall response rate was 82% (complete response, 50%; unconfirmed complete response, 5%; partial response, 26%), including 80% of patients with MCL (median age, 68; seven complete responses, one partial response). Median progression-free survival (PFS) was 25.6 months. Median PFS of patients with nonblastoid variant MCL (n = 8) was 35.9 months. CONCLUSION: FFR was active in MCL, indolent B-NHL, and CLL and should be studied for older patients with MCL who are not candidates for aggressive chemotherapy.","['Lin, Thomas S', 'Blum, Kristie A', 'Fischer, Diane Beth', 'Mitchell, Sarah M', 'Ruppert, Amy S', 'Porcu, Pierluigi', 'Kraut, Eric H', 'Baiocchi, Robert A', 'Moran, Mollie E', 'Johnson, Amy J', 'Schaaf, Larry J', 'Grever, Michael R', 'Byrd, John C']","['Lin TS', 'Blum KA', 'Fischer DB', 'Mitchell SM', 'Ruppert AS', 'Porcu P', 'Kraut EH', 'Baiocchi RA', 'Moran ME', 'Johnson AJ', 'Schaaf LJ', 'Grever MR', 'Byrd JC']","['Division of Hematology and Oncology, The Ohio State University, Center for Biostatistics, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH 43210, USA.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial, Phase I', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20091214,United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Flavonoids)', '0 (Piperidines)', '45AD6X575G (alvocidib)', '4F4X42SYQ6 (Rituximab)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'P2K93U8740 (fludarabine)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/administration & dosage', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'B-Lymphocytes', 'Female', 'Flavonoids/administration & dosage', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/drug therapy', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/drug therapy', 'Lymphoma, Mantle-Cell/*drug therapy', 'Lymphoproliferative Disorders/drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Piperidines/administration & dosage', 'Rituximab', 'Vidarabine/administration & dosage/analogs & derivatives']",2009/12/17 06:00,2010/02/05 06:00,['2009/12/17 06:00'],"['2009/12/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/12/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/02/05 06:00 [medline]']","['JCO.2009.24.1570 [pii]', '10.1200/JCO.2009.24.1570 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2010 Jan 20;28(3):418-23. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2009.24.1570.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Eligible patients had lower-risk MDS (International Prognostic Scoring System low or intermediate 1), a mean baseline platelet count <or= 50 x 10(9)/L, and were only receiving supportive care. Patients received three injections of 300, 700, 1,000, or 1,500 microg romiplostim at weekly intervals. After evaluation of platelet response at week 4, patients could continue to receive romiplostim in a treatment extension phase for up to 1 year. RESULTS: All 44 patients who enrolled completed the treatment phase; 41 patients continued into the extension phase. Median platelet counts increased throughout the study, from fewer than 30 x 10(9)/L at baseline to 60, 73, 38, and 58 x 10(9)/L at week 4 for the 300-, 700-, 1,000-, and 1,500 -microg dose cohorts, respectively. A durable platelet response (per International Working Group 2000 criteria for 8 consecutive weeks independent of platelet transfusions) was achieved by 19 patients (46%). The incidence of bleeding events and platelet transfusions was less common among patients who achieved a durable platelet response than those who did not (4.3 v 39.3 per 100 patient-weeks). Forty-three patients (98%) reported one or more adverse events. Treatment-related serious adverse events were reported in five patients (11%), all of whom were in the 1,500-microg dose cohort. Two patients progressed to acute myeloid leukemia during the study. No neutralizing antibodies to either romiplostim or endogenous thrombopoietin were seen. CONCLUSION: Romiplostim appeared well-tolerated in this study and may be a useful treatment for patients with MDS and thrombocytopenia.","['Kantarjian, Hagop', 'Fenaux, Pierre', 'Sekeres, Mikkael A', 'Becker, Pamela S', 'Boruchov, Adam', 'Bowen, David', 'Hellstrom-Lindberg, Eva', 'Larson, Richard A', 'Lyons, Roger M', 'Muus, Petra', 'Shammo, Jamile', 'Siegel, Robert', 'Hu, Kuolung', 'Franklin, Janet', 'Berger, Dietmar P']","['Kantarjian H', 'Fenaux P', 'Sekeres MA', 'Becker PS', 'Boruchov A', 'Bowen D', 'Hellstrom-Lindberg E', 'Larson RA', 'Lyons RM', 'Muus P', 'Shammo J', 'Siegel R', 'Hu K', 'Franklin J', 'Berger DP']","['Leukemia Department, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, 1515 Holcombe Blvd, Box 428, Houston, TX 77030, USA. hkantarj@mdanderson.org']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial, Phase I', 'Clinical Trial, Phase II', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20091214,United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,"['0 (Hematologic Agents)', '0 (Receptors, Fc)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '9014-42-0 (Thrombopoietin)', 'GN5XU2DXKV (romiplostim)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Female', 'Hematologic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/complications/*drug therapy', 'Receptors, Fc/*therapeutic use', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/*therapeutic use', 'Thrombocytopenia/*drug therapy/etiology', 'Thrombopoietin/*therapeutic use', 'Treatment Outcome']",2009/12/17 06:00,2010/02/05 06:00,['2009/12/17 06:00'],"['2009/12/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/12/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/02/05 06:00 [medline]']","['JCO.2009.24.7999 [pii]', '10.1200/JCO.2009.24.7999 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2010 Jan 20;28(3):437-44. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2009.24.7999.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 476 patients were randomly assigned 2:1 to imatinib 800 mg (n = 319) or 400 mg (n = 157) daily. The primary end point was the major molecular response (MMR) rate at 12 months. RESULTS: At 12 months, differences in MMR and complete cytogenetic response (CCyR) rates were not statistically significant (MMR, 46% v 40%; P = .2035; CCyR, 70% v 66%; P = .3470). However, MMR occurred faster among patients randomly assigned to imatinib 800 mg/d, who had higher rates of MMR at 3 and 6 months compared with those in the imatinib 400-mg/d arm (P = .0035 by log-rank test). CCyR also occurred faster in the 800-mg/d arm (CCyR at 6 months, 57% v 45%; P = .0146). The most common adverse events were edema, gastrointestinal problems, and rash, and all were more common in patients in the 800-mg/d arm. Grades 3 to 4 hematologic toxicity also occurred more frequently in patients receiving imatinib 800 mg/d. CONCLUSION: MMR rates at 1 year were similar with imatinib 800 mg/d and 400 mg/d, but MMR and CCyR occurred earlier in patients treated with 800 mg/d.

The tumor suppressor phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) is also mutated or lost in up to 20% of cases. It was recently observed among human T-ALL cell lines that PTEN loss correlated with resistance to Notch inhibition, raising concern that patients with PTEN-negative disease may fail Notch inhibitor therapy. As these studies were limited to established cell lines, we addressed this issue using a genetically defined mouse retroviral transduction/bone marrow transplantation model and observed primary murine leukemias to remain dependent on NOTCH1 signaling despite Pten loss, with or without additional deletion of p16(Ink4a)/p19(Arf). We also examined 13 primary human T-ALL samples obtained at diagnosis and found no correlation between PTEN status and resistance to Notch inhibition. Furthermore, we noted in the mouse model that Pten loss accelerated disease onset and produced multiclonal tumors, suggesting NOTCH1 activation and Pten loss may collaborate in leukemia induction. Thus, in contrast to previous findings with established cell lines, these results indicate PTEN loss does not relieve primary T-ALL cells of their ""addiction"" to Notch signaling.","['Medyouf, Hind', 'Gao, Xiuhua', 'Armstrong, Florence', 'Gusscott, Samuel', 'Liu, Qing', 'Gedman, Amanda Larson', 'Matherly, Larry H', 'Schultz, Kirk R', 'Pflumio, Francoise', 'You, Mingjian James', 'Weng, Andrew P']","['Medyouf H', 'Gao X', 'Armstrong F', 'Gusscott S', 'Liu Q', 'Gedman AL', 'Matherly LH', 'Schultz KR', 'Pflumio F', 'You MJ', 'Weng AP']","['Terry Fox Laboratory, BC Cancer Agency, Vancouver, BC.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",20091211,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Cdkn2a protein, mouse)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p16)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Il2rg protein, mouse)', '0 (Interleukin Receptor Common gamma Subunit)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptor, Notch1)', 'EC 3.1.3.67 (PTEN Phosphohydrolase)', 'EC 3.4.- (Amyloid Precursor Protein Secretases)']",IM,"['Amyloid Precursor Protein Secretases/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Animals', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p16/*physiology', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Interleukin Receptor Common gamma Subunit/physiology', 'Leukemia, Experimental/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Mice, SCID', 'PTEN Phosphohydrolase/genetics/*metabolism', 'Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'Receptor, Notch1/genetics/*metabolism', 'Retroviridae/genetics', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Signal Transduction', 'Transduction, Genetic']",2009/12/17 06:00,2010/03/20 06:00,['2009/12/17 06:00'],"['2009/12/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/12/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/03/20 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)49249-3 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2009-04-214718 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2010 Feb 11;115(6):1175-84. doi: 10.1182/blood-2009-04-214718.

We studied 16 patients with JAK2-mutant (7 of 16) or JAK2 wild-type (9 of 16) AML after a JAK2-mutant MPN. Primary myelofibrosis or myelofibrotic transformation preceded all 7 JAK2-mutant but only 1 of 9 JAK2 wild-type AMLs (P = .001), implying that JAK2-mutant AML is preceded by mutation(s) that give rise to a ""myelofibrosis"" phenotype. Loss of the JAK2 mutation by mitotic recombination, gene conversion, or deletion was excluded in all wild-type AMLs. A search for additional mutations identified alterations of RUNX1, WT1, TP53, CBL, NRAS, and TET2, without significant differences between JAK2-mutant and wild-type leukemias. In 4 patients, mutations in TP53, CBL, or TET2 were present in JAK2 wild-type leukemic blasts but absent from the JAK2-mutant MPN. By contrast in a chronic-phase patient, clones harboring mutations in JAK2 or MPL represented the progeny of a shared TET2-mutant ancestral clone. These results indicate that different pathogenetic mechanisms underlie transformation to JAK2 wild-type and JAK2-mutant AML, show that TET2 mutations may be present in a clone distinct from that harboring a JAK2 mutation, and emphasize the clonal heterogeneity of the MPNs.","['Beer, Philip A', 'Delhommeau, Francois', 'LeCouedic, Jean-Pierre', 'Dawson, Mark A', 'Chen, Edwin', 'Bareford, David', 'Kusec, Rajko', 'McMullin, Mary Frances', 'Harrison, Claire N', 'Vannucchi, Alessandro M', 'Vainchenker, William', 'Green, Anthony R']","['Beer PA', 'Delhommeau F', 'LeCouedic JP', 'Dawson MA', 'Chen E', 'Bareford D', 'Kusec R', 'McMullin MF', 'Harrison CN', 'Vannucchi AM', 'Vainchenker W', 'Green AR']","['Department of Haematology, Cambridge Institute for Medical Research, Cambridge, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20091211,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (TP53 protein, human)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', 'EC 1.13.11.- (Dioxygenases)', 'EC 1.13.11.- (TET2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-cbl)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (JAK2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 2)', 'EC 6.3.2.- (CBL protein, human)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Blast Crisis/*genetics/metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Dioxygenases', 'Female', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Janus Kinase 2/*genetics/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/metabolism', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Mutation', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/*genetics/metabolism', 'Primary Myelofibrosis/*genetics/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-cbl/genetics/metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/genetics/metabolism']",2009/12/17 06:00,2010/04/28 06:00,['2009/12/17 06:00'],"['2009/12/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/12/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/04/28 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)56534-8 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2009-08-236596 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2010 Apr 8;115(14):2891-900. doi: 10.1182/blood-2009-08-236596.

DNAM-1 is an NK cell receptor whose importance in facilitating activation signals received by NK cells in natural and cytokine-driven responses to tumor metastases in vivo is poorly explored. In this study, we used matched tumor lines expressing a variety of relevant ligands, neutralizing monoclonal Abs, and DNAM-1 gene-targeted mice to determine the relative importance of DNAM-1-ligand interactions in controlling tumor metastases. Our results demonstrate that NK cells require DNAM-1 for natural or cytokine (IL-2, IL-12, or IL-21) suppression of tumor metastases or their variants expressing CD70 or CD80. In contrast, DNAM-1 was dispensable when tumor cells were targets of Ab-dependent cellular cytotoxicity or presented ligands for NKG2D. CD155 appeared to be a key ligand recognized by DNAM-1 in NK cell-mediated suppression of metastases, and DNAM-1-mediated suppression coincided with perforin activity. Overall, these data implied a general role for DNAM-1-CD155 interactions in NK cell-mediated killing of tumors, even in the presence of tumor CD70 or CD80 expression, and further defined the optimal efficacy requirements of cytokines that directly activate NK cells.","['Chan, Christopher J', 'Andrews, Daniel M', 'McLaughlin, Nicole M', 'Yagita, Hideo', 'Gilfillan, Susan', 'Colonna, Marco', 'Smyth, Mark J']","['Chan CJ', 'Andrews DM', 'McLaughlin NM', 'Yagita H', 'Gilfillan S', 'Colonna M', 'Smyth MJ']","['Cancer Immunology Program, Sir Donald and Lady Trescowthick Laboratories, Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre, East Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20091211,United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte)', '0 (B7-1 Antigen)', '0 (CD226 antigen)', '0 (CD27 Ligand)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Ligands)', '0 (Receptors, Virus)', '0 (poliovirus receptor)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibody-Dependent Cell Cytotoxicity', 'Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte/*immunology/metabolism', 'B7-1 Antigen', 'CD27 Ligand', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cytokines/*immunology', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*immunology', 'Ligands', 'Melanoma, Experimental/immunology/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Neoplasm Metastasis/*immunology', 'Receptors, Virus/*immunology/metabolism']",2009/12/17 06:00,2010/02/09 06:00,['2009/12/17 06:00'],"['2009/12/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/12/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/02/09 06:00 [medline]']","['jimmunol.0903225 [pii]', '10.4049/jimmunol.0903225 [doi]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 2010 Jan 15;184(2):902-11. doi: 10.4049/jimmunol.0903225.

Indeed, in a series of gene transfer trials for two different primary immunodeficiencies beginning early in this decade, outstanding success has been achieved. Despite generally low levels of engrafted, genetically modified HSCs, these trials were successful because of the marked selective advantage of gene-corrected lymphoid precursors that allowed reconstitution of the immune system. Unlike the immunodeficiencies, this robust level of in vivo selection is not available to hematopoietic repopulating cells or early progenitor cells following gene transfer of a therapeutic globin gene in the setting of beta-thalassemia and sickle cell disease. Both preclinical and clinical transplant studies involving bone marrow chimeras suggest that 20% or higher levels of engraftment of genetically modified HSCs will be needed for clinical success in the most severe of these disorders. Encouragingly, gene transfer levels in this range have recently been reported in a lentiviral vector gene transfer clinical trial for children with adrenoleukodystrophy. A clinical gene transfer trial for beta-thalassemia has begun in France, and one patient with transfusion-dependent HbE/beta-thalassemia has demonstrated a therapeutic effect after transplantation with autologous CD34(+) cells genetically modified with a beta-globin lentiviral vector.

Although new treatments are available, a mainstay in MDS remains supportive care, which aims to minimize the impact of cytopenias and transfusion of blood products. Red blood cell (RBC) transfusions place patients at risk of iron overload (IOL). In beta-thalassemia major (BTM), IOL from chronic RBC transfusions inevitably leads to organ dysfunction and death. With iron chelation therapy (ICT), survival in BTM improved from the second decade to near normal and correlated with ICT compliance. Effects of ICT in BTM include reversal of cardiac arrhythmias, improvement in left ventricular ejection fraction, arrest of hepatic fibrosis, and reduction of glucose intolerance. It is not clear whether these specific outcomes are applicable to MDS. Although retrospective, recent studies in MDS suggest an adverse effect of transfusion dependence and IOL on survival and AML transformation, and that lowering iron minimizes this impact. These data raise important points that warrant further study. ICT is potentially toxic and cumbersome, is costly, and in MDS patients should be initiated only after weighing potential risks against benefits until further data are available to better justify its use. Since most MDS patients eventually require RBC transfusions, the public health implications both of transfusion dependence and ICT in MDS are considerable. This paper summarizes the impact of cytopenias in MDS and treatment approaches to minimize their impact, with a focus on RBC transfusions and their complications, particularly with respect to iron overload.","['Leitch, Heather A', 'Vickars, Linda M']","['Leitch HA', 'Vickars LM']","[""Division of Hematology, St. Paul's Hospital and the University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada. hleitch@providencehematology.com""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,Hematology Am Soc Hematol Educ Program,Hematology.

The crucial anti-leukemic principle of alloSCT in CLL appears to be the immune-mediated anti-host activities conferred with the graft (graft-versus-leukemia effects, GVL). Evidence for GVL in CLL is provided by studies analyzing the kinetics of minimal residual disease on response to immune modulation after transplantation, suggesting that GVL can result in complete and durable suppression of the leukemic clone. AlloSCT from matched related or unrelated donors can overcome the treatment resistance of poor-risk CLL, ie, purine analogue refractory disease and CLL with del 17p-. Even with reduced-intensity conditioning, alloSCT in CLL is associated with significant mortality and morbidity due to graft-versus-host disease, which has to be weighed against the risk of the disease when defining the indication for transplantation. Therefore, it can be regarded as a reasonable treatment option only for eligible patients who fulfill accepted criteria for poor-risk disease. If alloSCT is considered, it should be performed before CLL has advanced to a status of complete refractoriness to assure an optimum chance for a successful outcome. Prospective trials are underway to prove whether allo-SCT can indeed change the natural history of poor-risk CLL.","['Dreger, Peter']",['Dreger P'],"['Department of Medicine V, University of Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany. peter.dreger@med.uni-heidelberg.de']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,Hematology Am Soc Hematol Educ Program,Hematology.

While this is true for adults in all age groups, it may not be the best clinical option for young adults for whom increasingly intensive pediatric protocols are clearly of benefit. On the other hand, there is potentially wider applicability of allogeneic donor transplantation for adults 25 to 45 years old, for whom matched unrelated donors may be as safe and effective as sibling donors, and for the patient older than 45 years for whom reduced-intensity conditioning may be a promising way forward. Since the treatment-related mortality of allogeneic transplantation remains significant, careful selection of patients is mandatory. Patients with the Philadelphia chromosome, those with t(4;11) and those with a complex karyotype remain transplant candidates, and allogeneic transplantation remains the best option for salvage, where achievable, in a remission beyond first. As in childhood ALL minimal residual disease studies may be extremely useful in predicting outcome and, therefore, strategy, but at present there are less definite data in adults. Clinical indications to harness the allogeneic effect will mature as the true value of pediatric protocols in adult patients and the safety and efficacy of a sibling, unrelated and reduced intensity transplant emerge in this disease.","['Goldstone, Anthony H', 'Rowe, Jacob M']","['Goldstone AH', 'Rowe JM']","['UCL Hospitals, London, United Kingdom. anthony.goldstone@uclh.nhs.uk']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,Hematology Am Soc Hematol Educ Program,Hematology.

After the initial target of therapy, complete cytogenetic response (CCR), is achieved, peripheral blood BCR-ABL transcript levels measured by real-time quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR (RQ-PCR) define the subsequent response targets, major and complete molecular response (MMR and CMR). The majority of patients on first-line imatinib therapy achieve a ""safe haven"" defined as a confirmed MMR, but 20% to 30% stop imatinib due to intolerance and/or resistance. Many imatinib-resistant patients can be effectively treated with second generation tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), but the actual drug selected should be based on the resistance profile of each inhibitor, in addition to issues of tolerance and disease phase. The main purpose of monitoring response with cytogenetics and RQ-PCR is to identify patients likely to achieve better long-term outcome if they are switched early to second-line therapy, either another TKI or an allograft. Mutation screening is most valuable in cases of loss of response to imatinib or a second-line TKI, but there are other settings where a high yield of mutations may justify regular mutation screening.","['Hughes, Timothy P', 'Branford, Susan']","['Hughes TP', 'Branford S']","['Centre for Cancer Biology, Departments of Molecular Pathology and Haematology, SA Pathology, Adelaide, Australia. timothy.hughes@health.sa.gov.au']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,Hematology Am Soc Hematol Educ Program,Hematology.

Moreover, the strides in drug design and development that have also ensued around CML have given rise to what others have called a molecular revolution in cancer therapy. While a majority of patients with chronic phase CML (CP-CML) have an excellent durable response to imatinib (Gleevec, Novartis, Basel, Switzerland), a clear minority will unfortunately have signs of primary or secondary resistance to therapy. Significant efforts geared toward understanding the molecular mechanisms of imatinib resistance have yielded valuable insights into the biology of drug trafficking into and out of cells, epigenetic control of cellular processes, alterations in enzymatic structures, and the rational structural-based design of small molecule enzyme inhibitors.

Five years after starting imatinib about 60% of these patients will be in complete cytogenetic response (CCyR), still taking imatinib; an appreciable proportion of these will have achieved a major molecular response, defined as a 3-log reduction in the level of BCR-ABL1 transcripts in their blood. The patients in CCyR seem to have a very low risk of relapse to chronic phase or of progression to advanced phase. Other patients may be resistant to imatinib or may experience significant side effects that require change of therapy. The best method of monitoring responding patients is to enumerate Philadelphia chromosome-positive marrow metaphases at 3-month intervals until CCyR and to perform RQ-PCR for BCR-ABL1 transcripts at 3-month intervals after starting imatinib. The recommendations for defining ""failure"" and ""sub-optimal response"" proposed by the European LeukemiaNet in 2006 have proved to be a major contribution to assessing responses in individual patients and are now being updated. Patients who fail imatinib may respond to second-generation TKIs, but allogeneic stem cell transplantation still plays an important role for eligible patients who fare badly with TKIs. Patients who present in advanced phases of CML should be treated initially with TKI alone or with TKI in conjunction with cytotoxic drugs, but their overall prognosis is likely to be much inferior to that of those presenting in early chronic phase.","['Goldman, John M']",['Goldman JM'],"['Department of Hematology, Imperial College London, Hammersmith Hospital, London, United Kingdom. jgoldman@imperial.ac.uk']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,Hematology Am Soc Hematol Educ Program,Hematology.

Routine diagnostic techniques can now detect very low levels of CLL phenotype cells. Monoclonal B-cell lymphocytosis (MBL) is a relatively recent diagnostic category encapsulating individuals with an abnormal B-cell population but not meeting the diagnostic criteria for a B-cell malignancy. This review focuses on CLL-type MBL, which represents the majority of MBL cases identified in diagnostic laboratories. CLL-type MBL has a phenotype identical to CLL and shares the same chromosomal abnormalities even at the lowest levels detectable. Recent evidence suggests that the immunoglobulin gene usage plays a key role in whether the abnormal cells will develop in significant numbers. In most cases, CLL-type MBL is a stable condition with only 1% per year among those presenting for clinical attention developing progressive disease requiring treatment, although suppressed immune function may have a more significant impact on outcome.","['Rawstron, Andy C']",['Rawstron AC'],"[""HMDS, Department of Haematology, St. James's Institute of Oncology, Leeds, United Kingdom. andy.rawstron@hmds.org.uk""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,Hematology Am Soc Hematol Educ Program,Hematology.

Recent clinical trials using reduced-intensity allogeneic transplantation regimens suggest that a proportion of patients with this disease can be cured, with results comparable to those achieved in younger patients undergoing fully ablative transplant. Although those patients who undergo transplant in a first remission often do well, the vast majority of older patients have not benefited because of the low successful remission achieved with standard therapy, the delay in initiating a donor search, and the lack of significant benefit from transplantation in patients who are not in remission.

The median age at presentation has been steadily increasing over the past few decades and now is approaching 70 years. Although considerable progress has been made over the past 3 decades in the therapy of AML, two thirds of young adults still die of their disease. The therapy of AML, unlike acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), is based on maximally tolerated induction and post-remission therapy, all given within a few months from diagnosis. While complete remission can be achieved in the majority of young patients, ultimate cure of the disease depends on disease eradication through the administration of post-remission therapy. This is most often done with intensive chemotherapy. Harnessing the immunologic effect of graft-versus-leukemia, as in allogeneic transplantation, has further improved the outcome for many patients. Treatment of older adults, representing the majority of patients with AML, remains quite unsatisfactory. While 40% to 50% can achieve a complete remission, less than 10% are long-term survivors, and the cure rate of older patients has only minimally improved over the past three decades. Significant progress in the treatment of this age group is urgently required. New and targeted agents have much promise, but a definitive clinical role for these has yet to be conclusively established.","['Rowe, Jacob M']",['Rowe JM'],"['Department of Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation, Rambam Medical Center and Technion, Israel Institute of Technology, Haifa, Israel. rowe@jimmy.harvard.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,Hematology Am Soc Hematol Educ Program,Hematology.

These have not only afforded greater insights into disease biology, but also provided useful information predicting the likelihood of any given patient achieving and maintaining remission following conventional chemotherapy, leading to the development of risk-stratified treatment approaches. However, it is becoming increasingly apparent that AML is highly heterogeneous at the molecular level. Defining the individual genetic abnormalities or combinations of markers that provide significant independent prognostic information and establishing their respective relationships to other pre-treatment characteristics that impact on outcome, such as age and presenting white blood cell count, presents a major ongoing challenge. Moreover, there is increasing evidence that risk of relapse and overall survival can be predicted by assessment of kinetics and depth of response following front-line therapy and monitoring of the leukemic burden using molecular or immunological approaches to minimal residual disease (MRD) detection. These advances present the exciting prospect that panels of pre-treatment parameters affording independent prognostic information can be integrated with precise measurement of treatment response using MRD technologies to provide greater refinement in risk-adapted management of AML. This could lead to further improvements in outcome and serve to identify in a more reliable fashion those patients most likely to benefit from allogeneic transplant in first remission.","['Grimwade, David', 'Hills, Robert K']","['Grimwade D', 'Hills RK']","[""Department of Medical & Molecular Genetics, King's College London School of Medicine, London, United Kingdom. david.grimwade@genetics.kcl.ac.uk""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",,United States,Hematology Am Soc Hematol Educ Program,Hematology.

Treatment outcome with imatinib-based regimens has improved compared with historic controls, but most patients who do not undergo allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT) eventually relapse. Acquired resistance on TKI treatment is associated with mutations in the bcr-abl tyrosine kinase domain in the majority of patients, and may be detected at low frequency prior to TKI treatment in a subset of patients. Second generation TKIs, eg, dasatinib and nilotinib, show activity against most of the bcr-abl tyrosine kinase domain (TKD) mutations involved in acquired imatinib resistance, but clinical benefit is generally short-lived. Accordingly, SCT in first complete remission (CR) is considered to be the best curative option. Molecular monitoring of minimal residual disease levels appears to have prognostic relevance and should be used to guide treatment. International standardization and quality control efforts are ongoing to ensure comparability of results. Mutation analysis during treatment relies increasingly on highly sensitive PCR techniques or denaturing HPLC and may assist in treatment decisions, eg, in case of molecular relapse. Results from current studies of second-generation TKI as front-line treatment for Ph(+) ALL are promising and show high molecular response rates, but follow-up is still too short to determine their impact on remission duration and long-term survival. Strategies to improve outcome after SCT include the pre-emptive use of imatinib, which appears to reduce the relapse rate. In patients ineligible for transplantation, novel concepts for maintenance therapy are needed. These could involve novel immunotherapeutic interventions and combinations of TKI.","['Ottmann, Oliver G', 'Pfeifer, Heike']","['Ottmann OG', 'Pfeifer H']","['Medizinische Klinik II, Department of Hematology and Oncology, Goethe University, Frankfurt, Germany. ottmann@em.uni-frankfurt.de']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Hematology Am Soc Hematol Educ Program,Hematology.

Telomeres inevitably shorten with every cell cycle, and telomere attrition has been hypothesized to be fundamental to normal senescence of cells, tissues, and organisms. Molecular mechanisms have evolved to maintain their length and protective function; telomerase (TERT) is a reverse transcriptase enzyme that uses an RNA molecule (TERC) as the template to elongate the 3' ends of telomeres. Shelterin is a collection of DNA-binding proteins that cover and protect telomeres. The recent discovery of inherited mutations in genes that function to repair telomeres as etiologic in a range of human diseases, which have clinical manifestations in diverse tissues, including the hematopoietic tissue, suggests that defects in telomere repair and protection can cause organ failure. Dyskeratosis congenita is the prototype of telomere diseases; it is characterized by bone marrow failure, mucocutaneous abnormalities, pulmonary fibrosis, liver cirrhosis, and increased susceptibility to cancer, including acute myeloid leukemia. Aplastic anemia, acute myeloid leukemia, and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis also are associated with inherited mutations in telomere repair or protection genes. Additionally, telomere defects associate with predisposition to hematologic malignancy and epithelial tumors. Telomere erosion is abnormally rapid in patients with mutations in telomerase genes but also after hematopoietic stem cell transplant, and telomeres are naturally shorter in older individuals-all conditions associated with higher rates of malignant diseases. In human tissue culture, short telomeres produce end-to-end chromosome fusion, nonreciprocal translocations, and aneuploidy.","['Calado, Rodrigo T']",['Calado RT'],"['Hematology Branch, National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892-1202, USA. calador@nhlbi.nih.gov']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,Hematology Am Soc Hematol Educ Program,Hematology.

The bulk of the current evidence suggests that hydroxyurea is well-tolerated, safe, and efficacious for most patients with SCD. Hydroxyurea has proven clinical efficacy for reducing acute vaso-occlusive events including pain episodes and acute chest syndrome. Salutary effects on hematological parameters include increases in fetal hemoglobin (HbF), hemoglobin, and MCV; also significant decreases occur in WBC, ANC, reticulocytes, LDH, and bilirubin. Treatment with hydroxyurea is usually considered for patients with recurrent vaso-occlusive events, but additional indications for treatment may include laboratory markers of disease severity and evidence of chronic organ dysfunction. Ten years ago, the US Food and Drug Administration approved hydroxyurea for adult patients with clinically severe SCD; however, its use in children remains off-label. Despite the large body of evidence regarding its efficacy and safety, hydroxyurea is currently prescribed only sparingly for patients with SCD and therefore has only limited effectiveness for this disorder; barriers to its use need to be identified and overcome.","['Ware, Russell E', 'Aygun, Banu']","['Ware RE', 'Aygun B']","[""Department of Hematology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN 38105-2794, USA. russell.ware@stjude.org""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,Hematology Am Soc Hematol Educ Program,Hematology.

The Ham-Wasserman Lecture.,3-12,10.1182/asheducation-2009.1.3 [doi],"All cancers evolve by a process of genetic diversification and ""natural selection"" akin to the process first described by Charles Darwin for species evolution. The evolutionary, natural history of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is almost entirely covert, clinically silent and well advanced by the point of diagnosis. It has, however, been possible to backtrack this process by molecular scrutiny of appropriate clinical samples: (i) leukemic clones in monozygotic twins that are either concordant or discordant for ALL; (ii) archived neonatal blood spots or Guthrie cards from individuals who later developed leukemia; and (iii) stored, viable cord blood cells. These studies indicate prenatal initiation of leukemia by chromosome translocation and gene fusion (or hyperdiploidy) and the post-natal acquisition of multiple, gene copy number alterations (CNAs), mostly deletions. The prenatal or first ""hit"" occurs very commonly, exceeding the clinical rate of ALL by some 100x and indicating a low rate of penetrance or evolutionary progression. The acquisition of the critical, secondary CNAs requires some Darwinian selective advantage to expand numbers of cells at risk, and the cytokine TGF beta is able to exercise this function. The clonal architecture of ALL has been investigated by single cell analysis with multicolor probes to mutant genes. The data reveal not a linear sequence of mutation acquisition with clonal succession but rather considerable complexity with a tree-like or branching structure of genetically distinct subclones very reminiscent of Darwin's original 1837 evolutionary divergence diagram. This evolutionary pattern has important implications for stem cells in ALL, for the origins of relapse and for therapeutic targeting.","['Greaves, Mel']",['Greaves M'],"['Institute of Cancer Research, Sutton, Surrey, United Kingdom. mel.greaves@icr.ac.uk']",['eng'],"['Lecture', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Hematology Am Soc Hematol Educ Program,Hematology.

The major stress proteins Hsp72, Hsp90, and Hsp27 are credible candidates to provide this resistance, as their overexpression in many cancer types is well documented. In addition to being present inside tumor cells, where they confer resistance to apoptosis, Hsp72, in particular, is presented externally, embedded in the cell membrane of cancer cells. This study aimed to investigate the localization of Hsp72, Hsp90, and Hsp27 in leukocytes from patients with CLL and age-matched control subjects. CLL patients were found to express significantly higher levels of iHsp90 (CLL=2463 MFI; control=748 MFI) and iHsp27 (CLL=2190 MFI; control=1031 MFI) in lymphocytes than that expressed by lymphocytes from control subjects. Furthermore, expression of iHsp90 was shown to be related to stage of disease, and expression of iHsp27 correlated with levels of active caspase-3. Patients were found to express very high levels or very low levels of sHsp72 and iHsp72 in CD5(+)/CD19(+) cells, although surface and intracellular datasets did not correlate. Levels of extracellular Hsp72 circulating in the serum were found to correlate with internal levels of Hsp72 and were also found to be significantly lower in patients receiving corticosteroid treatment than in patients not receiving corticosteroid treatment. Finally, analysis of the number of circulating Tregs revealed significantly elevated numbers in CLL patients compared with control subjects.","['Dempsey, Nina C', 'Leoni, Francesca', 'Ireland, H Elyse', 'Hoyle, Christine', 'Williams, John H H']","['Dempsey NC', 'Leoni F', 'Ireland HE', 'Hoyle C', 'Williams JH']","['Chester Centre for Stress Research, University of Chester, Chester, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20091210,United States,J Leukoc Biol,Journal of leukocyte biology,8405628,"['0 (Antigens, CD19)', '0 (CD5 Antigens)', '0 (HSP27 Heat-Shock Proteins)', '0 (HSP72 Heat-Shock Proteins)', '0 (HSP90 Heat-Shock Proteins)', '0 (Heat-Shock Proteins)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antigens, CD19/metabolism', 'CD4 Lymphocyte Count', 'CD5 Antigens/metabolism', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Caspase 3/metabolism', 'Cell Membrane/metabolism', 'Disease Progression', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Extracellular Space/metabolism', 'Female', 'HSP27 Heat-Shock Proteins/metabolism', 'HSP72 Heat-Shock Proteins/blood/metabolism', 'HSP90 Heat-Shock Proteins/metabolism', 'Heat-Shock Proteins/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Intracellular Space/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/blood/enzymology/immunology/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Protein Transport', 'T-Lymphocytes, Regulatory/enzymology/pathology']",2009/12/17 06:00,2010/04/03 06:00,['2009/12/17 06:00'],"['2009/12/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/12/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/04/03 06:00 [medline]']","['jlb.0709502 [pii]', '10.1189/jlb.0709502 [doi]']",ppublish,J Leukoc Biol. 2010 Mar;87(3):467-76. doi: 10.1189/jlb.0709502.

We evaluated the feasibility of giving polyethylene glycosylated (PEG)-asparaginase, the polyethylene glycol conjugate of Escherichia coli L-asparaginase, by intravenous infusion in children with ALL. Between 2005 and 2007, 197 patients (age, 1-17 years) were enrolled on Dana-Farber Cancer Institute ALL Consortium Protocol 05-01 and received a single dose of intravenous PEG-asparaginase (2500 IU/m(2)) over 1 hour during remission induction.

The major role of pDCs is to secrete massive levels of interferon-alpha (IFN-alpha) upon virus exposure; however, the induction of IFN-alpha by HTLV-1 remains unknown. We demonstrate here that cell-free HTLV-1 generated a pDC innate immune response by producing massive levels of IFN-alpha that were inhibited by anti-HTLV-1 antibodies. HTLV-1 induced costimulatory molecules and rapid expression of the apoptotic ligand tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL). Furthermore, HTLV-1 stimulated pDC-induced apoptosis of CD4(+) T cells expressing DR5, transforming pDCs into IFN-producing killer pDCs. We also observed that an endosomal acidification inhibitor and a Toll-like receptor-7 (TLR7)-specific blocker drastically inhibited pDC response to HTLV-1. Three-dimensional microscopy analysis revealed that unstimulated pDCs were ""dormant"" IFN-producing killer pDCs with high levels of intracellular TRAIL that could be rapidly mobilized to the surface in response to TLR7 activation. Inhibition of viral degradation in endosomes by chloroquine maintained viral integrity, allowing virus detection by 3-dimensional microscopy. We demonstrate that pDCs respond to cell-free HTLV-1 by producing high levels of IFN-alpha and by mobilizing TRAIL on cell surface after TLR7 triggering. This is the first demonstration of an innate immune response induced by free HTLV-1.","['Colisson, Renaud', 'Barblu, Lucie', 'Gras, Christophe', 'Raynaud, Francoise', 'Hadj-Slimane, Reda', 'Pique, Claudine', 'Hermine, Olivier', 'Lepelletier, Yves', 'Herbeuval, Jean-Philippe']","['Colisson R', 'Barblu L', 'Gras C', 'Raynaud F', 'Hadj-Slimane R', 'Pique C', 'Hermine O', 'Lepelletier Y', 'Herbeuval JP']","['Centre Nationale de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS) Unite Mixte de Recherche (UMR) 8147, Universite Paris Descartes, Paris, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20091210,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (TLR7 protein, human)', '0 (TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand)', '0 (Toll-Like Receptor 7)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)']",IM,"['Cell-Free System', '*Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Dendritic Cells/*immunology/*virology', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Immunity, Innate/*immunology', 'Interferon-gamma/biosynthesis', 'Microscopy', 'Phenotype', 'Protein Transport', 'TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand/*metabolism', 'Toll-Like Receptor 7/*immunology', 'Virion/immunology']",2009/12/17 06:00,2010/04/14 06:00,['2009/12/17 06:00'],"['2009/12/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/12/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/04/14 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)56627-5 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2009-06-224741 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2010 Mar 18;115(11):2177-85. doi: 10.1182/blood-2009-06-224741.

We found that inhibition of FLT3 autophosphorylation in a FLT3/ITD specimen does not always induce cell death, suggesting that some FLT3/ITD AML may not be addicted to FLT3 signaling. Relapsed samples and samples with a high mutant allelic burden were more likely to be responsive to cytotoxicity from FLT3 inhibition compared with the samples obtained at diagnosis or those with a low mutant allelic burden. These FLT3 inhibitors varied to a considerable degree in their selectivity for FLT3, and this selectivity influenced the cytotoxic effect. These results have important implications for the potential therapeutic use of FLT3 inhibitors in that patients with newly diagnosed FLT3-mutant AML might be less likely to respond clinically to highly selective FLT3 inhibition.","['Pratz, Keith W', 'Sato, Takashi', 'Murphy, Kathleen M', 'Stine, Adam', 'Rajkhowa, Trivikram', 'Levis, Mark']","['Pratz KW', 'Sato T', 'Murphy KM', 'Stine A', 'Rajkhowa T', 'Levis M']","['Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD 21231, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20091210,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzenesulfonates)', '0 (Benzothiazoles)', '0 (Carbazoles)', '0 (Furans)', '0 (Indazoles)', '0 (Indoles)', '0 (KW 2449)', '0 (Phenylurea Compounds)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyridines)', '0 (Pyrroles)', '25X51I8RD4 (Niacinamide)', '7LA4O6Q0D3 (quizartinib)', '9ZOQ3TZI87 (Sorafenib)', 'DO989GC5D1 (lestaurtinib)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)', 'H88EPA0A3N (Staurosporine)', 'ID912S5VON (midostaurin)', 'V99T50803M (Sunitinib)']",IM,"['Alleles', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Benzenesulfonates/pharmacology', 'Benzothiazoles/pharmacology', 'Carbazoles/*pharmacology', 'Cell Death/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Furans', 'Humans', 'Indazoles/pharmacology', 'Indoles/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/*genetics', 'Mutation', 'Niacinamide/analogs & derivatives', 'Phenylurea Compounds/pharmacology', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Piperazines/pharmacology', 'Pyridines/pharmacology', 'Pyrroles/pharmacology', 'Sorafenib', 'Staurosporine/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Sunitinib', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/*antagonists & inhibitors/*genetics']",2009/12/17 06:00,2010/03/27 06:00,['2009/12/17 06:00'],"['2009/12/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/12/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/03/27 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)56754-2 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2009-09-242859 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2010 Feb 18;115(7):1425-32. doi: 10.1182/blood-2009-09-242859.

An important question regarding HECT domain function is the control of ligase activity and specificity. Here we present a functional analysis of the HECT domain of the E3 ligase HUWE1 based on crystal structures and show that a single N-terminal helix significantly stabilizes the HECT domain. We observe that this element modulates HECT domain activity, as measured by self-ubiquitination induced in the absence of this helix, as distinct from its effects on Ub conjugation of substrate Mcl-1. Such subtle changes to the protein may be at the heart of the vast spectrum of substrate specificities displayed by HECT domain E3 ligases.","['Pandya, Renuka K', 'Partridge, James R', 'Love, Kerry Routenberg', 'Schwartz, Thomas U', 'Ploegh, Hidde L']","['Pandya RK', 'Partridge JR', 'Love KR', 'Schwartz TU', 'Ploegh HL']","['Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research, Cambridge, Massachusetts 02142, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",20091210,United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '0 (Ubiquitin)', 'EC 2.3.2.26 (HUWE1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases)']",IM,"['Catalytic Domain/physiology', 'Crystallography, X-Ray', 'Humans', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Protein Structure, Secondary/physiology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/chemistry/genetics/metabolism', 'Substrate Specificity/physiology', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins', 'Ubiquitin/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Ubiquitination/*physiology']",2009/12/17 06:00,2010/03/12 06:00,['2009/12/17 06:00'],"['2009/12/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/12/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/03/12 06:00 [medline]']","['S0021-9258(19)37544-1 [pii]', '10.1074/jbc.M109.051805 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2010 Feb 19;285(8):5664-73. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M109.051805.

Overcoming acquired resistance is a daunting therapeutic challenge, and little is known about how these mutations evolve. To facilitate understanding the resistance mechanisms, we developed a novel culture model for CML acquired resistance in which the CML cell line KCL-22, following initial response to imatinib, develops resistant T315I BCR-ABL mutation. We demonstrate that the emergence of BCR-ABL mutations do not require pre-existing BCR-ABL mutations derived from the original patient as the subclones of KCL-22 cells can form various BCR-ABL mutations upon imatinib treatment. BCR-ABL mutation rates vary from cell clone to clone and passages, in contrast to the relatively stable mutation rate of the hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase gene. Strikingly, development of BCR-ABL mutations depends on its gene expression because BCR-ABL knockdown completely blocks KCL-22 cell relapse on imatinib and acquisition of mutations. We further show that the endogenous BCR-ABL locus has significantly higher mutagenesis potential than the transduced randomly integrated BCR-ABL cDNA. Our study suggests important roles of BCR-ABL gene expression and its native chromosomal locus for acquisition of BCR-ABL mutations and provides a new tool for further studying resistance mechanisms.","['Yuan, Hongfeng', 'Wang, Zhiqiang', 'Gao, Chunggang', 'Chen, Wengang', 'Huang, Qin', 'Yee, Jiing-Kuan', 'Bhatia, Ravi', 'Chen, WenYong']","['Yuan H', 'Wang Z', 'Gao C', 'Chen W', 'Huang Q', 'Yee JK', 'Bhatia R', 'Chen W']","['Department of Cancer Biology, City of Hope, Duarte, California 91010, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",20091210,United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects/genetics', 'Benzamides', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Cycle/genetics/physiology', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*genetics', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/genetics/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Immunoprecipitation', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*genetics', 'Mutation/genetics/physiology', 'Piperazines/pharmacology', 'Pyrimidines/pharmacology', 'RNA, Small Interfering/genetics/physiology', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism']",2009/12/17 06:00,2010/05/12 06:00,['2009/12/17 06:00'],"['2009/12/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/12/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/05/12 06:00 [medline]']","['S0021-9258(20)81012-6 [pii]', '10.1074/jbc.M109.039206 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2010 Feb 12;285(7):5085-96. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M109.039206.

In vitro differentiation of ES cells into mouse erythrocytes indicated that the natural sequential expression of epsilon, gamma and beta-globin genes was reproduced on the globin-HAC. Combination of MMCT and a novel chromosome transfection technique allowed transfer of globin-HAC from HT1080 cells into the human leukemia cell line K562, and from K562 cells back into HT1080 cells. Expression of the gamma-globin gene, repressed in HT1080 cells, was activated in K562 cells without any processes of differentiation into adult erythroid cells, and was completely repressed again in HT1080 cells when transferred back from K562 cells.

We designed a method for in vivo induction of Ag-specific Tregs, in BALB/c H-2d, that share characteristics with type 1 Tregs (Tr1). A retroviral vector was constructed encoding a major T cell epitope of a common allergen, Der p 2, fused to an endosomal targeting sequence (gp75) for efficient MHC class II presentation. B cells transduced with such construct were adoptively transferred to BALB/c mice before or after peptide immunization. Long-lasting Ag-specific immune tolerance was achieved in both cases. Genetically modified B cells constitutively expressed the transgene for at least 3 mo. B cells from IL-10(-/-) mice were unable to induce tolerance. Upon transfer, B cells induced Foxp3(-)CD4(+) T cells showing phenotypic and functional characteristics comparable to Tr1-cells, including production of IL-10 but not of TGF-beta, and high expression of CTLA-4. Adoptive transfer of such T cells conferred unresponsiveness to allergen immunization and prevented the development of Der p 2-induced asthma.

Three mutations were identified, all of which occurred in mice with Zeb2 integrations, consistent with the hypothesis that Zeb2 and Ras pathway activation promotes B-lineage leukemic transformation in concert with CALM-AF10.","['Caudell, David', 'Harper, David P', 'Novak, Rachel L', 'Pierce, Rachel M', 'Slape, Christopher', 'Wolff, Linda', 'Aplan, Peter D']","['Caudell D', 'Harper DP', 'Novak RL', 'Pierce RM', 'Slape C', 'Wolff L', 'Aplan PD']","['Department of Biomedical Sciences and Pathobiology, Center for Molecular Medicine and Infectious Diseases, Virginia-Maryland Regional College of Veterinary Medicine, Virginia Tech, Blacksburg, VA, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural']",20091209,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (AF10-CALM fusion protein, human)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (ZEB2 protein, mouse)', '0 (Zinc Finger E-box Binding Homeobox 2)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (ras Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Blotting, Southern', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Homeodomain Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia, B-Cell/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic', '*Mutagenesis, Insertional', 'Mutation/genetics', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*genetics', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'RNA, Small Interfering/pharmacology', 'Repressor Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Retroviridae/*genetics', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Signal Transduction', 'Zinc Finger E-box Binding Homeobox 2', 'ras Proteins/genetics']",2009/12/17 06:00,2010/03/20 06:00,['2009/12/17 06:00'],"['2009/12/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/12/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/03/20 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)49251-1 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2009-04-216184 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2010 Feb 11;115(6):1194-203. doi: 10.1182/blood-2009-04-216184.

However, the mechanism by which CBFB-MYH11 initiates leukemogenesis is not clear. Previously published reports showed that CBFB-MYH11 dominantly inhibits RUNX1 and CBFB, and such inhibition has been suggested as the mechanism for leukemogenesis. Here we show that Cbfb-MYH11 caused Cbfb/Runx1 repression-independent defects in both primitive and definitive hematopoiesis. During primitive hematopoiesis, Cbfb-MYH11 delayed differentiation characterized by sustained expression of Gata2, Il1rl1, and Csf2rb, a phenotype not found in Cbfb and Runx1 knockout mice. Expression of Cbfb-MYH11 in the bone marrow induced the accumulation of abnormal progenitor-like cells expressing Csf2rb in preleukemic mice. The expression of all 3 genes was detected in most human and murine CBFB-MYH11(+) leukemia samples. Interestingly, Cbfb-MYH11(+) preleukemic progenitors and leukemia-initiating cells did not express Csf2rb, although the majority of leukemia cells in our Cbfb-MYH11 knockin mice were Csf2rb(+). Therefore Csf2rb can be used as a negative selection marker to enrich preleukemic progenitor cells and leukemia-initiating cells from Cbfb-MYH11 mice. These results suggest that Cbfb/Runx1 repression-independent activities contribute to leukemogenesis by Cbfb-MYH11.","['Hyde, R Katherine', 'Kamikubo, Yasuhiko', 'Anderson, Stacie', 'Kirby, Martha', 'Alemu, Lemlem', 'Zhao, Ling', 'Liu, P Paul']","['Hyde RK', 'Kamikubo Y', 'Anderson S', 'Kirby M', 'Alemu L', 'Zhao L', 'Liu PP']","['Genetics and Molecular Biology Branch, National Human Genome Research Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural']",20091209,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (CBFbeta-MYH11 fusion protein)', '0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (Cytokine Receptor Common beta Subunit)', '0 (GATA2 Transcription Factor)', '0 (GATA2 protein, human)', '0 (IL1RL1 protein, human)', '0 (Interleukin-1 Receptor-Like 1 Protein)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Receptors, Cell Surface)', '0 (Runx1 protein, mouse)', '144715-98-0 (Csf2rb protein, mouse)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/physiology', 'Biomarkers', 'Cell Differentiation/physiology', 'Cell Division/physiology', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit/genetics/*metabolism', 'Cytokine Receptor Common beta Subunit/genetics/*metabolism', 'GATA2 Transcription Factor/genetics/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Hematopoiesis/physiology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/pathology/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-1 Receptor-Like 1 Protein', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/genetics/*metabolism', 'Phenotype', 'Receptors, Cell Surface/genetics/metabolism', 'Up-Regulation/physiology']",2009/12/17 06:00,2010/03/27 06:00,['2009/12/17 06:00'],"['2009/12/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/12/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/03/27 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)56755-4 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2009-06-227413 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2010 Feb 18;115(7):1433-43. doi: 10.1182/blood-2009-06-227413.

The overall patterns of NOTCH1-mediated gene expression in human and mouse T-ALLs were remarkably similar, as defined early in transformation in the mouse by the regulation of MYC and its target genes and activation of nuclear factor-kappaB and PI3K/AKT pathways. Later events in murine Notch1-mediated leukemogenesis included down-regulation of genes encoding tumor suppressors and negative cell cycle regulators. Gene set enrichment analysis and connectivity map algorithm predicted that small-molecule inhibitors, including heat-shock protein 90, histone deacetylase, PI3K/AKT, and proteasome inhibitors, could reverse the gene expression changes induced by NOTCH1. When tested in vitro, histone deacetylase, PI3K and proteasome inhibitors synergized with GSI in suppressing T-ALL cell growth in GSI-sensitive cells. Interestingly, alvespimycin, a potent inhibitor of the heat-shock protein 90 molecular chaperone, markedly inhibited the growth of both GSI-sensitive and -resistant T-ALL cells, suggesting that its loss disrupts signal transduction pathways crucial for the growth and survival of T-ALL cells.","['Sanda, Takaomi', 'Li, Xiaoyu', 'Gutierrez, Alejandro', 'Ahn, Yebin', 'Neuberg, Donna S', ""O'Neil, Jennifer"", 'Strack, Peter R', 'Winter, Christopher G', 'Winter, Stuart S', 'Larson, Richard S', 'von Boehmer, Harald', 'Look, A Thomas']","['Sanda T', 'Li X', 'Gutierrez A', 'Ahn Y', 'Neuberg DS', ""O'Neil J"", 'Strack PR', 'Winter CG', 'Winter SS', 'Larson RS', 'von Boehmer H', 'Look AT']","['Departments of Pediatric Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20091209,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (NOTCH1 protein, human)', '0 (Notch1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Receptor, Notch1)', 'EC 3.4.- (Amyloid Precursor Protein Secretases)']",IM,"['Amyloid Precursor Protein Secretases/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Animals', 'Cell Cycle', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cell Survival', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/genetics', 'Down-Regulation', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Genes, myc', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Leukemia, Experimental/drug therapy/etiology/genetics/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/etiology/*genetics/metabolism', 'Receptor, Notch1/genetics', 'Signal Transduction', 'Species Specificity']",2009/12/17 06:00,2010/04/03 06:00,['2009/12/17 06:00'],"['2009/12/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/12/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/04/03 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)56698-6 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2009-07-235143 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2010 Mar 4;115(9):1735-45. doi: 10.1182/blood-2009-07-235143.

For presentation of the envelope protein gp70 of Friend murine leukemia virus on the adenoviral capsid, gp70 was fused to the adenovirus capsid protein IX. When compared to vaccination with conventional FV Env- and Gag-encoding adenoviral vectors, vaccination with the adenoviral vector that encodes and displays pIX-gp70 combined with an FV Gag-encoding vector resulted in significantly improved protection against systemic FV challenge infection, with highly controlled viral loads in plasma and spleen. This improved protection correlated with improved neutralizing antibody titers and stronger CD4(+) T-cell responses. Using a vector that displays gp70 without encoding it, we found that while the antigen display on the capsid alone was sufficient to induce high levels of binding antibodies, in vivo expression was necessary for the induction of neutralizing antibodies.

Here, we have used cultured fibroblast and epithelial cell lines to test the hypothesis that XMRV might have direct transforming activity but found only rare transformation events, suggestive of indirect transformation, even when the target cells expressed the human Xpr1 cell entry receptor for XMRV. Characterization of cells from three transformed foci showed that all were infected with and produced XMRV, and one produced a highly active transforming virus, presumably generated by recombination between XMRV and host cell nucleic acids. Given the sequence similarity of XMRV to mink cell focus-forming (MCF) viruses and the enhanced leukemogenic activity of the latter, we tested XMRV for related MCF-like cytopathic activities in cultured mink cells but found none. These results indicate that XMRV has no direct transforming activity but can activate endogenous oncogenes, resulting in cell transformation. As part of these experiments, we show that XMRV can infect and be produced at a high titer from human HT-1080 fibrosarcoma cells that express TRIM5alpha (Ref1), showing that XMRV is resistant to TRIM5alpha restriction. In addition, XMRV poorly infects NIH 3T3 cells expressing human Xpr1 but relatively efficiently infects BALB 3T3 cells expressing human Xpr1, showing that XMRV is a B-tropic virus and that its infectivity is regulated by the Fv1 mouse locus.","['Metzger, Michael J', 'Holguin, Christiana J', 'Mendoza, Ramon', 'Miller, A Dusty']","['Metzger MJ', 'Holguin CJ', 'Mendoza R', 'Miller AD']","['Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, 1100 Fairview Ave. N., Seattle, WA 98109-1024, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20091209,United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Antiviral Restriction Factors)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, G-Protein-Coupled)', '0 (Receptors, Virus)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Tripartite Motif Proteins)', '0 (XPR1 protein, human)', '0 (Xenotropic and Polytropic Retrovirus Receptor)', '0 (Xpr1 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (TRIM5 protein, human)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antiviral Restriction Factors', 'Carrier Proteins/genetics/physiology', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'Cell Transformation, Viral', 'Cytopathogenic Effect, Viral', 'Dogs', 'Humans', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/pathogenicity', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mink Cell Focus-Inducing Viruses/pathogenicity', 'NIH 3T3 Cells', 'Prostatic Neoplasms/genetics/physiopathology/*virology', 'Rats', 'Receptors, G-Protein-Coupled/genetics/physiology', 'Receptors, Virus/genetics/physiology', 'Recombinant Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Retroviridae/*pathogenicity', 'Species Specificity', 'Tripartite Motif Proteins', 'Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases', 'Xenotropic and Polytropic Retrovirus Receptor']",2009/12/17 06:00,2010/02/19 06:00,['2009/12/17 06:00'],"['2009/12/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/12/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/02/19 06:00 [medline]']","['JVI.01941-09 [pii]', '10.1128/JVI.01941-09 [doi]']",ppublish,J Virol. 2010 Feb;84(4):1874-80. doi: 10.1128/JVI.01941-09.

Several scoring systems are available to predict outcome in HCT recipients; however, their prognostic relevance in acute lymphoblastic leukemia is not well defined. DESIGN AND METHODS: In the present study we evaluated a modified EBMT risk score (mEBMT) and the HCT-specific comorbidity index (HCT-CI) in 151 adult acute lymphoblastic leukemia patients who received allogeneic HCT from 1995 until 2007 at our center. RESULTS: Disease status was first complete remission (CR1) (47%), CR>1 (21%) or no CR (32%). Overall survival (OS) at one, two and five years was 62%, 51% and 40% and non-relapse mortality (NRM) was 21%, 24% and 32%. Median mEBMT was 3 (0-6). Higher mEBMT was associated with inferior OS (hazard ratio per score unit (HR): 1.50, P<0.001), higher NRM (HR: 1.36, P=0.042) and higher relapse mortality (HR: 1.68, P<0.001). Disease stage was the predominant prognostic factor in this score. Comorbidities were present in 71% of patients with mild hepatic disease (29%), moderate pulmonary disease (28%) and infections (23%) being the most common. Median HCT-CI was 1 (0-9). In univariate analysis a trend for inferior OS (HR: 1.08, P=0.20) and higher NRM (HR: 1.14, P=0.11) with increasing HCT-CI was observed but the level of significance was not reached. In additional analyses we found that reduced Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS) was associated with inferior OS (HR: 1.34, P=0.023) and higher relapse mortality (HR: 1.71, P=0.001) when analyzed univariately. However, KPS was associated with disease stage and significance was lost in multivariate analysis. CONCLUSIONS: The mEBMT was prognostic in our patient cohort with predominant influence of disease stage, whereas a trend but no significant prognostic value was observed for the HCT-CI.","['Terwey, Theis H', 'Hemmati, Philipp G', 'Martus, Peter', 'Dietz, Ekkehart', 'Vuong, Lam G', 'Massenkeil, Gero', 'Dorken, Bernd', 'Arnold, Renate']","['Terwey TH', 'Hemmati PG', 'Martus P', 'Dietz E', 'Vuong LG', 'Massenkeil G', 'Dorken B', 'Arnold R']","['Department of Hematology and Oncology, Charite - Universitatsmedizin Berlin, Campus Virchow-Klinikum, Augustenburger Platz 1, 13353 Berlin, Germany. theis.terwey@charite.de']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",20091208,Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Cohort Studies', 'Comorbidity', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/adverse effects/*standards', 'Humans', 'Karnofsky Performance Status/*standards', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/diagnosis/mortality/*surgery', 'Preoperative Care/adverse effects/*standards', 'Research Design/standards', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Transplantation Conditioning/adverse effects/*standards', 'Young Adult']",2009/12/17 06:00,2011/10/06 06:00,['2009/12/17 06:00'],"['2009/12/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/12/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/10/06 06:00 [medline]']","['haematol.2009.011809 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.2009.011809 [doi]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2010 May;95(5):810-8. doi: 10.3324/haematol.2009.011809.

Constitutive PI3K activation, reflecting an intrinsic oncogenic deregulation of primary blast cells, is detected in 50% of patients with acute myeloid leukemia. However, the mechanisms leading to this activation are currently unknown. As we previously reported IGF-1 autocriny in acute myeloid leukemia cells, we investigated whether IGF-1 signaling was involved in the constitutive activation of PI3K. DESIGN AND METHODS: We analyzed the IGF-1/IGF-1R signaling pathway and PI3K activity in 40 acute myeloid leukemia bone marrow samples. Specific inhibition of IGF-1/IGF-1R signaling was investigated using neutralizing anti-IGF-1R, anti-IGF-1 antibodies or IGF-1 short interfering RNA. The anti-leukemic activity of the neutralizing anti-IGF-1R was tested by analyzing its effects on leukemic progenitor clonogenicity, blast cell proliferation and survival. RESULTS: In all samples tested, we found that functional IGF-1R was constantly expressed in leukemic cells. In the acute myeloid leukemia samples with PI3K activation, we found that the IGF-1R was constitutively phosphorylated, although no IGF-1R activating mutation was detected. Specific inhibition of IGF-1R signaling with neutralizing anti-IGF-1R strongly inhibited the constitutive phosphorylation of both IGF-1R and Akt in 70% of the PI3K activated samples. Moreover, both incubation with anti-IGF-1 antibody and IGF-1 short interfering RNA inhibited Akt phosphorylation in leukemic cells. Finally, neutralizing anti-IGF-1R treatment decreased the clonogenicity of leukemic progenitors and the proliferation of PI3K activated acute myeloid leukemia cells. CONCLUSIONS: Our current data indicate a critical role for IGF-1 autocriny in constitutive PI3K/Akt activation in primary acute myeloid leukemia cells and provide a strong rationale for targeting IGF-1R as a potential new therapy for this disease.","['Chapuis, Nicolas', 'Tamburini, Jerome', 'Cornillet-Lefebvre, Pascale', 'Gillot, Lucile', 'Bardet, Valerie', 'Willems, Lise', 'Park, Sophie', 'Green, Alexa S', 'Ifrah, Norbert', 'Dreyfus, Francois', 'Mayeux, Patrick', 'Lacombe, Catherine', 'Bouscary, Didier']","['Chapuis N', 'Tamburini J', 'Cornillet-Lefebvre P', 'Gillot L', 'Bardet V', 'Willems L', 'Park S', 'Green AS', 'Ifrah N', 'Dreyfus F', 'Mayeux P', 'Lacombe C', 'Bouscary D']","[""Departement d'Hematologie, Institut Cochin, CNRS, UMR8104, Paris, France.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20091208,Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,"['0 (Antibodies, Anti-Idiotypic)', '0 (Antibodies, Neutralizing)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '67763-96-6 (Insulin-Like Growth Factor I)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor, IGF Type 1)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antibodies, Anti-Idiotypic/therapeutic use', 'Antibodies, Neutralizing/*therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis', 'Autocrine Communication', 'Blast Crisis', 'Blotting, Western', 'Bone Marrow/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Insulin-Like Growth Factor I/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*metabolism/therapy', 'Middle Aged', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/*metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/*metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'Receptor, IGF Type 1/antagonists & inhibitors/immunology/*metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Signal Transduction/*physiology']",2009/12/17 06:00,2010/07/09 06:00,['2009/12/17 06:00'],"['2009/12/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/12/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/07/09 06:00 [medline]']","['haematol.2009.010785 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.2009.010785 [doi]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2010 Mar;95(3):415-23. doi: 10.3324/haematol.2009.010785.

However, the stochastic nature of hematopoiesis and recent clinical observations suggest that this view must be revisited. DESIGN AND METHODS: We studied the natural history of a large cohort of virtual patients with chronic myeloid leukemia under tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy using a computational model of hematopoiesis and chronic myeloid leukemia that takes into account stochastic dynamics within the hematopoietic stem and early progenitor cell pool. RESULTS: We found that in the overwhelming majority of patients the leukemic stem cell population undergoes extinction before disease diagnosis. Hence leukemic progenitors, susceptible to tyrosine kinase inhibitor attack, are the natural target for chronic myeloid leukemia treatment. Response dynamics predicted by the model closely match data from clinical trials. We further predicted that early diagnosis together with administration of tyrosine kinase inhibitor opens the path to eradication of chronic myeloid leukemia, leading to the wash out of the aberrant progenitor cells, ameliorating the patient's condition while lowering the risk of blast transformation and drug resistance. CONCLUSIONS: Tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy can cure chronic myeloid leukemia, although it may have to be prolonged. The depth of response increases with time in the vast majority of patients. These results illustrate the importance of stochastic effects on the dynamics of acquired hematopoietic stem cell disorders and have direct relevance for other hematopoietic stem cell-derived diseases.","['Lenaerts, Tom', 'Pacheco, Jorge M', 'Traulsen, Arne', 'Dingli, David']","['Lenaerts T', 'Pacheco JM', 'Traulsen A', 'Dingli D']","[""MLG, Departement d'Informatique, Universite Libre de Bruxelles, Brussels, Belgium.""]",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20091208,Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,"['0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)']",IM,"['Benzamides', 'Cohort Studies', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*drug effects/enzymology/pathology', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/enzymology/*pathology', '*Models, Biological', 'Piperazines/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Pyrimidines/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Random Allocation', 'Time Factors']",2009/12/17 06:00,2011/08/09 06:00,['2009/12/17 06:00'],"['2009/12/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/12/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/08/09 06:00 [medline]']","['haematol.2009.015271 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.2009.015271 [doi]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2010 Jun;95(6):900-7. doi: 10.3324/haematol.2009.015271.

The presence of building work near to hospital wards in which these patients are cared for is an important risk factor for the development of invasive aspergillosis. This study assessed the impact of voriconazole or caspofungin prophylaxis in patients undergoing induction chemotherapy for acute leukemia in a hematology unit exposed to building work. DESIGN AND METHODS: This retrospective cohort study was carried out between June 2003 and January 2006 during which building work exposed patients to a persistently increased risk of invasive aspergillosis. This study compared the cumulative incidence of invasive aspergillosis in patients who did or did not receive primary antifungal prophylaxis. The diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis was based on the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer/Mycosis Study Group criteria. RESULTS: Two-hundred and fifty-seven patients (213 with acute myeloid leukemia, 44 with acute lymphocytic leukemia) were included. The mean age of the patients was 54 years and the mean duration of their neutropenia was 21 days. Eighty-eight received antifungal prophylaxis, most with voriconazole (n=74). The characteristics of the patients who did or did not receive prophylaxis were similar except that pulmonary antecedents (chronic bronchopulmonary disorders or active tobacco use) were more frequent in the prophylaxis group. Invasive aspergillosis was diagnosed in 21 patients (12%) in the non-prophylaxis group and four (4.5%) in the prophylaxis group (P=0.04). Pulmonary antecedents, neutropenia at diagnosis and acute myeloid leukemia with high-risk cytogenetics were positively correlated with invasive aspergillosis, whereas primary prophylaxis was negatively correlated. Survival was similar in both groups. No case of zygomycosis was observed. The 3-month mortality rate was 28% in patients with invasive aspergillosis. CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that antifungal prophylaxis with voriconazole could be useful in acute leukemia patients undergoing first remission-induction chemotherapy in settings in which there is a high-risk of invasive aspergillosis.","['Chabrol, Amelie', 'Cuzin, Lise', 'Huguet, Francoise', 'Alvarez, Muriel', 'Verdeil, Xavier', 'Linas, Marie Denise', 'Cassaing, Sophie', 'Giron, Jacques', 'Tetu, Laurent', 'Attal, Michel', 'Recher, Christian']","['Chabrol A', 'Cuzin L', 'Huguet F', 'Alvarez M', 'Verdeil X', 'Linas MD', 'Cassaing S', 'Giron J', 'Tetu L', 'Attal M', 'Recher C']","['Department of Infectious Diseases, Toulouse University Hospital, Toulouse, France.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",20091208,Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,"['0 (Air Pollutants)', '0 (Echinocandins)', '0 (Lipopeptides)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Triazoles)', 'F0XDI6ZL63 (Caspofungin)', 'JFU09I87TR (Voriconazole)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Air Pollutants/*adverse effects', 'Caspofungin', 'Cohort Studies', 'Construction Materials/*adverse effects', 'Echinocandins/*administration & dosage', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunocompromised Host/drug effects/immunology', 'Invasive Pulmonary Aspergillosis/etiology/immunology/*prevention & control', 'Lipopeptides', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/complications/*drug therapy/immunology', 'Pyrimidines/*administration & dosage', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Triazoles/*administration & dosage', 'Voriconazole', 'Young Adult']",2009/12/17 06:00,2011/08/09 06:00,['2009/12/17 06:00'],"['2009/12/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/12/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/08/09 06:00 [medline]']","['haematol.2009.012633 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.2009.012633 [doi]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2010 Jun;95(6):996-1003. doi: 10.3324/haematol.2009.012633.

Although most patients respond satisfactorily to imatinib, a subset of patients develops resistance mainly because of the acquisition of mutations within the kinase domain of BCR-ABL1 that impair the ability of TKIs to block the activity of the enzyme. Moreover, BCR-ABL1 transcripts can be detected in most patients by molecular techniques, underscoring the limitations of imatinib to eradicate minimal residual disease. Although the resistance conferred by most BCR-ABL1 mutations can be overcome with the use of second-generation TKIs such as nilotinib, dasastinib, bosutinib, or bafetinib, the T315I mutation, which represents a common resistance pathway in CML, remains unassailable to TKI therapy. We herein discuss current research efforts in 2 areas of vital importance in CML research, the management of patients with imatinib-resistant mutations, with particular emphasis on those carrying T315I, and the eradication of residual disease.","['Quintas-Cardama, Alfonso', 'Cortes, Jorge E']","['Quintas-Cardama A', 'Cortes JE']","['Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas M.

Imatinib therapy induces high rates of complete cytogenetic and major molecular responses, and improves survival in CML. Following imatinib treatment, more than 90% of patients obtain complete hematologic response, and over 80% achieve a complete cytogenetic response. With 7 years of follow-up, the results are still very favorable, resulting in a major change in the natural history of the disease. Resistance to imatinib represents a clinical challenge. Although some clinical and biologic features have been found to be associated with a lower probability of response to imatinib, at present no precise markers allowing for the prediction of outcome for individual patients exist. The most common mechanisms of resistance to imatinib include BCR-ABL kinase domain mutations, amplification, and overexpression of the BCR-ABL oncogene, and clonal evolution with activation of additional transformation pathways. These mechanisms are eventually caused by the genomic instability, which characterizes the Philadelphia chromosome-positive clone. Several approaches to overcome resistance have been proposed. The understanding of at least some of the mechanisms of resistance to imatinib has led to a rapid development of new therapeutic agents that might overcome this resistance. Novel targeted agents designed to overcome imatinib resistance include second-generation TKIs such as dasatinib, nilotinib, bosutinib, bafetinib, and others. Other approaches are exploring combination therapy, with agents affecting different oncogenic pathways, and immune modulation. Herein, we review some of these targeted therapies, particularly those for which clinical data are already available.","['Fava, Carmen', 'Cortes, Jorge E', 'Kantarjian, Hagop', 'Jabbour, Elias']","['Fava C', 'Cortes JE', 'Kantarjian H', 'Jabbour E']","['Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas M.

This gives rise to a constitutively active tyrosine kinase deregulation of the normal mechanisms of cell cycle control. In the normal hematopoietic system, hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) self-renew to form identical daughter cells but also differentiate to mature blood cells. Leukemic stem cells (LSC) share these properties of self-renewal and also differentiate to mature leukemic cells. LSC have been isolated from patients with CML: these cells give rise to leukemia following transplantation into NOD-SCID mice models. Further characterization of CML stem cells has demonstrated that a small percentage of these cells are quiescent despite culture with growth factors. The CML stem cell arises from a normal HSC that has acquired the Philadelphia chromosome. In advanced phase, more mature cells such as granulocyte/monocyte progenitors might also acquire the ability to self-renew and function as LSC. This might be one of the mechanisms underlying the progression to blast crisis. Quiescent stem cells are resistant to treatment with imatinib in vitro and are thought also to show resistance in vivo. The properties of the stem cells that lead to this drug resistance are still being characterized. However, this drug insensitivity leads to disease persistence that may lead to disease relapse even despite an initial response to imatinib.

DS patients display some of the physiopathological characteristics of aging, observed also in Alzheimer disease (AD), such as abnormalities in lipids metabolism, diabetes, high cholesterol fraction, senile plaques and neurofibrillary tangles. For this reason DS is considered a precocious and accelerated model of senescence, in which increased apoptosis is the main cornerstone. In order to better understand the apoptotic process in pathological cellular aspects of DS, the aim of this study was to investigate the apoptotic response of DS fibroblasts to OA, a toxin that induces malformations and inhibits growth in different cell lines. We focused specifically on the mitochondrial response by investigating changes in mitochondrial membrane potential (evaluate by flow cytometry and fluorescence microscopy using JC-1 probe) and alterations of mitochondrial outer membrane (evaluated by flow cytometry using annexin V/propidium iodide). Results indicates that DS Fibroblasts have a baseline of apoptosis higher than normal fibroblasts and are more susceptible to the pro-apoptotic effect of OA. Understanding the mechanism of apoptosis in DS fibroblasts could provide new insight in the pathogenic mechanism of this pathology and suggest potential therapeutical targets to the clinical treatment at complex diseases associated to this pathology.","['Dogliotti, G', 'Galliera, E', 'Dozio, E', 'Vianello, E', 'Villa, R E', 'Licastro, F', 'Barajon, I', 'Corsi, M M']","['Dogliotti G', 'Galliera E', 'Dozio E', 'Vianello E', 'Villa RE', 'Licastro F', 'Barajon I', 'Corsi MM']","['Department of Human Morphology and Biomedical Sciences Citta Studi, University of Milan, Via Mangiagalli 31 Milano, Italy. giada.dogliotti@unimi.it']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20091213,England,Toxicol In Vitro,Toxicology in vitro : an international journal published in association with BIBRA,8712158,"['0 (Annexin A5)', '0 (Coloring Agents)', '0 (Phospholipids)', '1W21G5Q4N2 (Okadaic Acid)', '36015-30-2 (Propidium)']",IM,"['Annexin A5', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Membrane/drug effects/ultrastructure', 'Coloring Agents', 'Down Syndrome/*pathology', 'Fibroblasts/*drug effects', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Membrane Potentials/drug effects', 'Microscopy, Fluorescence', 'Mitochondria/drug effects', 'Mitochondrial Membranes/drug effects', 'Okadaic Acid/*toxicity', 'Phospholipids/metabolism', 'Propidium']",2009/12/17 06:00,2010/06/23 06:00,['2009/12/17 06:00'],"['2009/08/24 00:00 [received]', '2009/11/12 00:00 [revised]', '2009/12/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/12/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/12/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/06/23 06:00 [medline]']","['S0887-2333(09)00371-3 [pii]', '10.1016/j.tiv.2009.12.012 [doi]']",ppublish,Toxicol In Vitro. 2010 Apr;24(3):815-21. doi: 10.1016/j.tiv.2009.12.012.

Circulating polyamines, spermine and spermidine, represent valuable prognostic markers in prostate cancer, acute leukemia and supratentorial malignant glioma. We tested whether spermine and spermidine could improve the prognostic ability of several established predictors of cancer specific mortality after partial or radical nephrectomy for renal cell carcinoma. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Testing was performed on 399 patients with stages T(1-4), N(0-2), M(0-1) renal cell carcinoma who were treated with radical or partial nephrectomy at a single institution between 1990 and 2007. Univariable and multivariable Cox regression models tested the prognostic ability of spermine and spermidine levels in cancer specific mortality predictions. Covariates consisted of TNM stage, Fuhrman grade, tumor size and symptom classification. Harrell's concordance index (c-index) quantified accuracy and 200 bootstrap resamples were used to correct for overfit bias. RESULTS: The 5-year cancer specific mortality-free survival of patients with spermine levels 3 or less, 3.1 to 8, 8.1 to 13 and greater than 13 nmol/8x10(9) erythrocytes was 88.8%, 75.8%, 40.2% and 21.8%, respectively. Similarly the 5-year cancer specific mortality-free survival of patients with spermidine levels 12 or less, 12.1 to 15, 15.1 to 21 and greater than 21 nmol/8x10(9) erythrocytes was 79.0%, 56.6%, 53.2% and 27.4%, respectively. On multivariable analyses addressing cancer specific mortality after surgery spermine (p = 0.007) and spermidine (p = 0.04) achieved independent predictor status. Consideration of spermine and spermidine also improved the accuracy of established cancer specific mortality predictors by 2.2% (p <0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Spermine and spermidine may significantly improve the prognostic value of established cancer specific mortality predictors after partial or radical nephrectomy for all stages of renal cell carcinoma. Independent external validation of our findings is required.","['Bigot, Pierre', 'Lughezzani, Giovanni', 'Karakiewicz, Pierre', 'Perrotte, Paul', 'Rioux-Leclercq, Nathalie', 'Catros-Quemener, Veronique', 'Bouet, Francoise', 'Moulinoux, Jean-Philippe', 'Cipolla, Bernard', 'Patard, Jean Jacques']","['Bigot P', 'Lughezzani G', 'Karakiewicz P', 'Perrotte P', 'Rioux-Leclercq N', 'Catros-Quemener V', 'Bouet F', 'Moulinoux JP', 'Cipolla B', 'Patard JJ']","['Rennes University Hospital, Rennes, France.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20091214,United States,J Urol,The Journal of urology,0376374,"['2FZ7Y3VOQX (Spermine)', 'U87FK77H25 (Spermidine)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Carcinoma, Renal Cell/*blood/*mortality/surgery', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Kidney Neoplasms/*blood/*mortality/surgery', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Nephrectomy', 'Prognosis', 'Prospective Studies', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Spermidine/*blood', 'Spermine/*blood', 'Survival Rate', 'Young Adult']",2009/12/17 06:00,2010/02/24 06:00,['2009/12/17 06:00'],"['2009/06/08 00:00 [received]', '2009/12/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/12/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/02/24 06:00 [medline]']","['S0022-5347(09)02647-0 [pii]', '10.1016/j.juro.2009.10.012 [doi]']",ppublish,J Urol. 2010 Feb;183(2):486-91. doi: 10.1016/j.juro.2009.10.012.

Mutant ESC lacking the Tcf3 transcriptional repressor continue to self-renew in the absence of exogenous Lif and through pharmacological inhibition of Lif/Jak/Stat3 signaling; however, proliferation rates of TCF3-/- ESC were significantly decreased by inhibiting Jak/Stat3 activity. Cell mixing experiments showed that stimulation of Stat3 phosphorylation in TCF3-/- ESC was mediated through secretion of paracrine acting factors, but did not involve elevated Lif or LifR transcription. The new interaction between Wnt and Lif/Jak/Stat3 signaling pathways has potential for new insights into the growth of tumors caused by aberrant activity of Wnt/Tcf/beta-catenin signaling.","['Yi, Fei', 'Merrill, Bradley J']","['Yi F', 'Merrill BJ']","['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Genetics, University of Illinois at Chicago, Chicago, IL 60607, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20091216,United States,Exp Cell Res,Experimental cell research,0373226,"['0 (2-tert-butyl-9-fluoro-3,6-dihydro-7H-benz(h)imidazo(4,5-f)isoquinoline-7-one)', '0 (Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors)', '0 (Benzimidazoles)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', '0 (Pyridones)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Tcf3 protein, mouse)', '0 (Wnt Proteins)', '0 (beta Catenin)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinases)']",IM,"['Animals', '*Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors/genetics/metabolism', 'Benzimidazoles/pharmacology', 'Cell Line', '*Cell Proliferation', 'Embryonic Stem Cells/cytology/drug effects/*physiology', 'Janus Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/genetics/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Phosphorylation', 'Pyridones/pharmacology', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor/genetics/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/physiology', 'Wnt Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'beta Catenin/genetics/metabolism']",2009/12/17 06:00,2010/03/31 06:00,['2009/12/17 06:00'],"['2009/10/05 00:00 [received]', '2009/12/05 00:00 [revised]', '2009/12/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/12/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/12/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/03/31 06:00 [medline]']","['S0014-4827(09)00527-8 [pii]', '10.1016/j.yexcr.2009.12.005 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Cell Res. 2010 Apr 1;316(6):1050-60. doi: 10.1016/j.yexcr.2009.12.005.

The aim of the present study was to investigate the in vitro and in vivo activity of glucomoringin (GMG), an uncommon member of the GLs family, and to compare it with glucoraphanin (GRA), one of the most studied GL. We have evaluated the potency of both compounds in inducing cell death, cell cycle perturbations, apoptosis, NF-kB inhibition and GST-pi activity in human carcinoma cells with different GST-pi contents as well as in human multiple myeloma and leukaemia cell lines. GMG-derived ITC (GMG-ITC) showed to be more effective compared to GRA-derived ITC (Sulforaphane), especially in inhibiting NF-kB activity and inducing apoptosis through a caspase-dependent pathway; these effects were more pronounced in myeloma cells, in which we could also observe a long lasting growth inhibitory effect, probably due to NF-kB inhibition, which is considered essential for myeloma cell survival. Both GLs were able to induce cell death in the muM range in all tested cell lines but caused cell cycle perturbations only in myeloma cells; they were also able to modulate the GST/GSH pathway by causing a 3-fold increase in GST-pi activity in MCF7 cells. In vivo study showed that pure GMG-ITC was only slightly active in a carcinoma mice model, whereas it had significant antitumoral activity in a myeloma model, causing little toxicity.","['Brunelli, Dario', 'Tavecchio, Michele', 'Falcioni, Cristiano', 'Frapolli, Roberta', 'Erba, Eugenio', 'Iori, Renato', 'Rollin, Patrick', 'Barillari, Jessica', 'Manzotti, Carla', 'Morazzoni, Paolo', ""D'Incalci, Maurizio""]","['Brunelli D', 'Tavecchio M', 'Falcioni C', 'Frapolli R', 'Erba E', 'Iori R', 'Rollin P', 'Barillari J', 'Manzotti C', 'Morazzoni P', ""D'Incalci M""]","['Department of Oncology, Istituto di Ricerche Farmacologiche Mario Negri, Milano, Italy. brunelli@marionegri.it']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20091216,England,Biochem Pharmacol,Biochemical pharmacology,0101032,"['0 (Glucosinolates)', '0 (Imidoesters)', '0 (Isothiocyanates)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Oximes)', '0 (Sulfoxides)', '3129-90-6 (isothiocyanic acid)', 'EC 2.5.1.18 (Glutathione S-Transferase pi)', 'EC 2.5.1.18 (Glutathione Transferase)', 'Q86A197713 (glucoraphanin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Female', 'Glucosinolates/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Glutathione S-Transferase pi/metabolism', 'Glutathione Transferase/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Imidoesters/pharmacology', 'Isothiocyanates/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Nude', 'Multiple Myeloma/*drug therapy/enzymology/pathology', 'NF-kappa B/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Oximes', 'Sulfoxides']",2009/12/17 06:00,2010/03/11 06:00,['2009/12/17 06:00'],"['2009/10/20 00:00 [received]', '2009/12/04 00:00 [revised]', '2009/12/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/12/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/12/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/03/11 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-2952(09)01066-1 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bcp.2009.12.008 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Pharmacol. 2010 Apr 15;79(8):1141-8. doi: 10.1016/j.bcp.2009.12.008.

However, despite the fact that it has been in use and studied for more than 30years the specific site on the enzyme to which it binds is unknown. In order to identify the etoposide binding site(s) on topoisomerase II, a diazirine-based photoaffinity etoposide analog probe has been synthesized and its photoreactivity and biological activities have been characterized. Upon UV irradiation, the diazirine probe rapidly produced a highly reactive carbene species that formed covalent adducts containing stable carbon-based bonds indicating that it should also be able to form stable covalent adducts with amino acid residues on topoisomerase II. The human leukemia K562 cell growth and topoisomerase II inhibitory properties of the diazirine probe suggest that it targets topoisomerase II in a manner similar to etoposide. The diazirine probe was also shown to act as a topoisomerase II poison through its ability to cause topoisomerase IIalpha-mediated double-strand cleavage of DNA. Additionally, the diazirine probe significantly increased protein-DNA covalent complex formation upon photoirradiation of diazirine probe-treated K562 cells, as compared to etoposide-treated cells. This result suggests that the photoactivated probe forms a covalent adduct with topoisomerase IIalpha. In conclusion, the present characterization of the chemical, biochemical, and biological properties of the newly synthesized diazirine-based photoaffinity etoposide analog indicates that use of a proteomics mass spectrometry approach will be a tractable strategy for future identification of the etoposide binding site(s) on topoisomerase II through covalent labeling of amino acid residues.","['Chee, Gaik-Lean', 'Yalowich, Jack C', 'Bodner, Andrew', 'Wu, Xing', 'Hasinoff, Brian B']","['Chee GL', 'Yalowich JC', 'Bodner A', 'Wu X', 'Hasinoff BB']","['Faculty of Pharmacy, University of Manitoba, Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada R3E 0T5. lean_chee@umanitoba.ca']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20091127,England,Bioorg Med Chem,Bioorganic & medicinal chemistry,9413298,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Photoaffinity Labels)', '0 (Solvents)', '0 (Topoisomerase II Inhibitors)', '60A625P70P (Diazomethane)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/chemical synthesis/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Binding Sites', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Chromatography, Liquid', 'DNA/drug effects', 'Diazomethane/*chemistry', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/chemical synthesis/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Etoposide/chemical synthesis/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Molecular Structure', 'Photoaffinity Labels/chemical synthesis/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Photochemistry', 'Solvents/chemistry', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Tandem Mass Spectrometry', '*Topoisomerase II Inhibitors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Ultraviolet Rays']",2009/12/17 06:00,2010/04/28 06:00,['2009/12/17 06:00'],"['2009/08/27 00:00 [received]', '2009/11/13 00:00 [revised]', '2009/11/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/12/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/12/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/04/28 06:00 [medline]']","['S0968-0896(09)01066-9 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bmc.2009.11.048 [doi]']",ppublish,Bioorg Med Chem. 2010 Jan 15;18(2):830-8. doi: 10.1016/j.bmc.2009.11.048.

Compound 3f exhibited good growth inhibitory properties against all but four of the human cancer cell lines examined, and afforded LC(50) values <10microM for 30% of the cell lines in the panel. Compound 3e was an effective inhibitor of leukemia, CNS, melanoma, and breast cancer cell growth, but generally less effective as a cytotoxic agent. Thus, the aplysinopsin analog 3f was regarded as a useful lead compound for further structural optimization.","['Penthala, Narsimha Reddy', 'Yerramreddy, Thirupathi Reddy', 'Crooks, Peter A']","['Penthala NR', 'Yerramreddy TR', 'Crooks PA']","['Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, College of Pharmacy, University of Kentucky, Lexington, KY 40536, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20091122,England,Bioorg Med Chem Lett,Bioorganic & medicinal chemistry letters,9107377,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Imidazoles)', '0 (Indoles)', '63153-56-0 (aplysinopsin)', '8DUH1N11BX (Tryptophan)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*chemical synthesis/chemistry/toxicity', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Humans', 'Imidazoles/*chemical synthesis/chemistry/toxicity', 'Indoles/*chemical synthesis/chemistry/toxicity', 'Microwaves', 'Tryptophan/analogs & derivatives/chemistry/pharmacology']",2009/12/17 06:00,2010/04/21 06:00,['2009/12/17 06:00'],"['2009/10/19 00:00 [received]', '2009/11/16 00:00 [revised]', '2009/11/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/12/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/12/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/04/21 06:00 [medline]']","['S0960-894X(09)01653-9 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bmcl.2009.11.083 [doi]']",ppublish,Bioorg Med Chem Lett. 2010 Jan 15;20(2):591-3. doi: 10.1016/j.bmcl.2009.11.083.

This study aimed to analyze the response to TKI therapy and overall survival for patients relapsing predominantly in advanced phase. We retrospectively reviewed 22 patients treated with imatinib (n=20) and/or dasatinib (n=6) for relapsed CML after HSCT; 8 patients were in CP, and 14 patients had advanced disease. Seven patients also received donor lymphocyte infusions. Hematologic, cytogenetic, and molecular responses were analyzed. Nineteen patients (86%) achieved complete hematologic response (CHR), 17 patients (77%) achieved complete cytogenetic response (CCR), and 14 patients (64%) achieved complete molecular response (CMR). In advanced phase patients, 11 (79%) achieved CHR, 10 (71%) CCR, and 8 (57%) achieved CMR. Grade 3 or 4 cytopenias occurred in 10 cases. With median follow-up of 31.5 months from relapse, 14 (64%) patients remain alive, 13 in CMR. In multivariate analysis, the achievement of CMR was significantly correlated with OS with an odds ratio of 20.5 (95% confidence interval 2.3-182) P=.007. TKI therapy is capable of inducing durable molecular responses for CML relapsing after HSCT, both in chronic and advanced phases.

However, because of intrinsic or acquired mechanisms of imatinib resistance, in addition to the persistence of leukaemic stem cells that are resistant to imatinib-induced apoptosis, imatinib treatment does not appear to be curative. Cytogenetic and molecular monitoring enable the identification of patients showing signs of treatment failure and can be used to guide choices regarding subsequent therapeutic options, including imatinib dose escalation, treatment with a secondary TKI or, in selected cases, allogeneic stem cell transplant (allo-SCT). Although these alternative therapies may overcome imatinib resistance, long-term remission or cure from CML is likely to require development of novel interventions that effectively eliminate CML stem cells (Ph+HSC).","['Irvine, David A', 'Heaney, Nicholas B', 'Holyoake, Tessa L']","['Irvine DA', 'Heaney NB', 'Holyoake TL']","[""Paul O'Gorman Leukaemia Research Centre, Section of Experimental Haematology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Glasgow, Gartnavel General Hospital, 1053 Great Western Road, Glasgow G12 0YN, United Kingdom. di10j@clinmed.gla.ac.uk""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,England,Blood Rev,Blood reviews,8708558,"['0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)']",IM,"['Disease Management', 'Drug Monitoring', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/therapy', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*therapeutic use', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors']",2009/12/17 06:00,2010/03/20 06:00,['2009/12/17 06:00'],"['2009/12/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/12/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/03/20 06:00 [medline]']","['S0268-960X(09)00067-8 [pii]', '10.1016/j.blre.2009.11.002 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood Rev. 2010 Jan;24(1):1-9. doi: 10.1016/j.blre.2009.11.002.,24,,,,,93,,['Copyright 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

JNK activation in particular is associated with treatment failure in AML. Tribbles proteins (trb-1, trb-2 and trb-3) are potent negative regulators of MAPK pathways influencing apoptosis, differentiation and cell-cycle progression. Here we aimed to examine tribbles gene expression in AML and to characterise their role in leukaemic cells. A microarray dataset was interrogated for tribbles expression levels in AML cases and healthy controls. Myeloid cell proliferation and apoptosis were assayed in response to trb-1/trb-2 gene knockdown and overexpression, as well as a physical and functional interaction between trb and C/EBPalpha. Trb-2 expression was reduced in AML compared to healthy controls (correlating with nucleophosmin (NPM1) mutations), while low trb-1 expression was associated with inactive C/EBPalpha. In vitro assays indicated that trb-1/trb-2 are growth restrictive and pro-apoptotic in Me-1 cells, each capable of inhibiting JNK activation. JNK inactivation was itself associated with reduced Bcl-2 Ser70 phosphorylation, a residue which, when phosphorylated, maintains the anti-apoptotic activity of Bcl-2. Consistent with this, tribbles-mediated dephosphorylation of Bcl-2 Ser70 was associated with subsequent apoptosis. Trb-1/trb-2 transcription appeared to be moderately C/EBPalpha-responsive, and physical interaction between C/EBPalpha and trb-1/trb-2 was observed, suggesting a potential for auto-regulation of trb-1 and trb-2 transcription. In conclusion, we propose that trb-1 and trb-2 tumour suppressor activity may be abrogated in a proportion of AML patients. This may lead to enhanced cell survival, and therefore contribute to pathogenesis of the disease. Trb-1/trb-2 may, therefore, represent useful therapeutic targets for the treatment of AML in patients with dys-regulated trb activity.","['Gilby, Daniel C', 'Sung, Hye Youn', 'Winship, Peter R', 'Goodeve, Anne C', 'Reilly, John T', 'Kiss-Toth, Endre']","['Gilby DC', 'Sung HY', 'Winship PR', 'Goodeve AC', 'Reilly JT', 'Kiss-Toth E']","['Department of Cardiovascular Science, University of Sheffield, Sheffield, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20091211,Netherlands,Immunol Lett,Immunology letters,7910006,"['0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (NPM1 protein, human)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (TRIB1 protein, human)', '117896-08-9 (Nucleophosmin)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.17 (Calcium-Calmodulin-Dependent Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.17 (TRIB2 protein, human)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Blotting, Western', 'Calcium-Calmodulin-Dependent Protein Kinases', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Child, Preschool', '*Down-Regulation', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Nucleophosmin', 'Protein Array Analysis', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/genetics/*metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Young Adult']",2009/12/17 06:00,2010/08/28 06:00,['2009/12/17 06:00'],"['2009/11/16 00:00 [received]', '2009/11/26 00:00 [revised]', '2009/12/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/12/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/12/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/08/28 06:00 [medline]']","['S0165-2478(09)00307-1 [pii]', '10.1016/j.imlet.2009.12.007 [doi]']",ppublish,Immunol Lett. 2010 May 4;130(1-2):115-24. doi: 10.1016/j.imlet.2009.12.007.

Cancer stem cells have been isolated and expanded from leukaemia and several solid tumours, and have been associated with metastasis, chemoresistance and relapse. CD133 is recognised as a stem cell marker and is capable of identifying a tumour-initiating subpopulation in brain, colon, melanoma and other solid tumours. METHODS: We assessed CD133 mRNA expression levels by RT-QPCR in tumour and matched normal tissue from 64 stages I-III colorectal cancer (CRC) patients and correlated tumour CD133 levels with clinicopathological characteristics and clinical outcome. RESULTS: In four patients, CD133 mRNA was not expressed in tumour or in normal tissue. In the remaining 60 patients, expression levels were higher in tumour than in normal tissue (p=0.001). Higher levels of CD133 expression were associated with shorter relapse-free interval (RFI) (p=0.004) and overall survival (OS) (p<0.0001). In the multivariate analyses, CD133 levels emerged as a prognostic marker for RFI and OS. CONCLUSIONS: We have observed longer RFI and OS in patients with lower levels of CD133, regardless of adjuvant treatment and other clinical characteristics. If these findings are confirmed in larger prospective studies, CD133 assessment may prove useful for new diagnostic and therapeutic procedures for CRC patients.","['Artells, R', 'Moreno, I', 'Diaz, T', 'Martinez, F', 'Gel, B', 'Navarro, A', 'Ibeas, R', 'Moreno, J', 'Monzo, M']","['Artells R', 'Moreno I', 'Diaz T', 'Martinez F', 'Gel B', 'Navarro A', 'Ibeas R', 'Moreno J', 'Monzo M']","['Human Anatomy Unit, Molecular Oncology and Embryology Laboratory, School of Medicine, University of Barcelona, IDIBAPS, Barcelona, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20091211,England,Eur J Cancer,"European journal of cancer (Oxford, England : 1990)",9005373,"['0 (AC133 Antigen)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Glycoproteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (PROM1 protein, human)', '0 (Peptides)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)']",IM,"['AC133 Antigen', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antigens, CD/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Chemotherapy, Adjuvant', 'Colorectal Neoplasms/drug therapy/metabolism/pathology/*surgery', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Glycoproteins/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Humans', 'Lymphatic Metastasis', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Peptides/genetics', 'Prognosis', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'RNA, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction/methods', 'Survival Analysis', 'Treatment Outcome']",2009/12/17 06:00,2010/04/10 06:00,['2009/12/17 06:00'],"['2009/09/04 00:00 [received]', '2009/10/20 00:00 [revised]', '2009/11/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/12/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/12/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/04/10 06:00 [medline]']","['S0959-8049(09)00841-7 [pii]', '10.1016/j.ejca.2009.11.003 [doi]']",ppublish,Eur J Cancer. 2010 Feb;46(3):642-9. doi: 10.1016/j.ejca.2009.11.003.

We assessed the benefit of adding chemotherapy to adjuvant tamoxifen and whether tamoxifen should be given concurrently or after chemotherapy. METHODS: We undertook a phase 3, parallel, randomised trial (SWOG-8814, INT-0100) in postmenopausal women with hormone-receptor-positive, node-positive breast cancer to test two major objectives: whether the primary outcome, disease-free survival, was longer with cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, and fluorouracil (CAF) given every 4 weeks for six cycles plus 5 years of daily tamoxifen than with tamoxifen alone; and whether disease-free survival was longer with CAF followed by tamoxifen (CAF-T) than with CAF plus concurrent tamoxifen (CAFT). Overall survival and toxicity were predefined, important secondary outcomes for each objective. Patients in this open-label trial were randomly assigned by a computer algorithm in a 2:3:3 ratio (tamoxifen:CAF-T:CAFT) and analysis was by intention to treat of eligible patients. Groups were compared by stratified log-rank tests, followed by Cox regression analyses adjusted for significant prognostic factors. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00929591. FINDINGS: Of 1558 randomised women, 1477 (95%) were eligible for inclusion in the analysis. After a maximum of 13 years of follow-up (median 8.94 years), 637 women had a disease-free survival event (tamoxifen, 179 events in 361 patients; CAF-T, 216 events in 566 patients; CAFT, 242 events in 550 patients). For the first objective, therapy with the CAF plus tamoxifen groups combined (CAFT or CAF-T) was superior to tamoxifen alone for the primary endpoint of disease-free survival (adjusted Cox regression hazard ratio [HR] 0.76, 95% CI 0.64-0.91; p=0.002) but only marginally for the secondary endpoint of overall survival (HR 0.83, 0.68-1.01; p=0.057). For the second objective, the adjusted HRs favoured CAF-T over CAFT but did not reach significance for disease-free survival (HR 0.84, 0.70-1.01; p=0.061) or overall survival (HR 0.90, 0.73-1.10; p=0.30). Neutropenia, stomatitis, thromboembolism, congestive heart failure, and leukaemia were more frequent in the combined CAF plus tamoxifen groups than in the tamoxifen-alone group. INTERPRETATION: Chemotherapy with CAF plus tamoxifen given sequentially is more effective adjuvant therapy for postmenopausal patients with endocrine-responsive, node-positive breast cancer than is tamoxifen alone. However, it might be possible to identify some subgroups that do not benefit from anthracycline-based chemotherapy despite positive nodes.

It focuses in particular, on the pathological effects of systemic conditions with less well recognised, but no less important, impacts on dental development. Such conditions, include cystic fibrosis, HIV/AIDS, leukaemia, Alstrom syndrome, hypophosphatasia, Prader-Willi syndrome, Tricho-dento-osseous syndrome, tuberous sclerosis, familial steroid dehydrogenase deficiency and epidermolysis bullosa. These, along with developmental and environmental causes of enamel and dentine defects, are discussed and the possible aetiology of such effects are proposed. Furthermore, the dental management and long-term dental care of these patients is outlined. SOURCES: MEDLINE/PubMed. CONCLUSIONS: Enamel and dentine defects can present with a wide spectrum of clinical features and may be caused by a variety of factors occurring throughout tooth development from before birth to adulthood. These may include host traits, genetic factors, immunological responses to cariogenic bacteria, saliva composition, environmental and behavioural factors and systemic diseases. These diseases and their spectrum of clinical manifestations on the organs affected (including the dentition) require an increased knowledge by dental practitioners of the disease processes, aetiology, relevant treatment strategies and prognosis, and must encompass more than simply the management of the dental requirements of the patient. It is important that the impact of the disease and its treatment, particularly in respect of immunosuppression where dental interventions may become life-threatening, is also taken into consideration.","['Atar, Michael', 'Korperich, Egbert J']","['Atar M', 'Korperich EJ']","['New York University NYU, College of Dentistry, Department of Pediatric Dentistry, New York, USA. atardrs@yahoo.com']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20100113,England,J Dent,Journal of dentistry,0354422,['EC 1.1.- (3-Hydroxysteroid Dehydrogenases)'],IM,"['3-Hydroxysteroid Dehydrogenases/deficiency', 'Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome/physiopathology', 'Alstrom Syndrome/physiopathology', 'Cystic Fibrosis/physiopathology', '*Disease', 'Ectodermal Dysplasia/physiopathology', 'Epidermolysis Bullosa/physiopathology', 'HIV Infections/physiopathology', 'Humans', 'Hypophosphatasia/physiopathology', 'Leukemia/physiopathology', 'Odontogenesis/*physiology', 'Prader-Willi Syndrome/physiopathology', 'Tuberous Sclerosis/physiopathology']",2009/12/17 06:00,2010/06/11 06:00,['2009/12/17 06:00'],"['2009/07/13 00:00 [received]', '2009/11/21 00:00 [revised]', '2009/12/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/12/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/12/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/06/11 06:00 [medline]']","['S0300-5712(09)00273-5 [pii]', '10.1016/j.jdent.2009.12.001 [doi]']",ppublish,J Dent. 2010 Apr;38(4):296-306. doi: 10.1016/j.jdent.2009.12.001.

Using real-time PCR (qPCR) to quantitate circulating viral DNA levels, previously we detected persistent FeLV DNA in blood cells of non-antigenemic cats considered to have resisted FeLV challenge. In addition, previously we used RNA qPCR to quantitate circulating viral RNA levels and determined that the vast majority of viral DNA is transcriptionally active, even in the absence of antigenemia. A single comparison of all USDA-licensed commercially available FeLV vaccines using these modern sensitive methods has not been reported. To determine whether FeLV vaccination would prevent nucleic acid persistence, we assayed circulating viral DNA, RNA, antigen, infectious virus, and virus neutralizing (VN) antibody in vaccinated and unvaccinated cats challenged with infectious FeLV. We identified challenged vaccinates with undetectable antigenemia and viremia concomitant with persistent FeLV DNA and/or RNA. Moreover, these studies demonstrated that two whole inactivated virus (WIV) adjuvanted FeLV vaccines (Fort Dodge Animal Health's Fel-O-Vax Lv-K) and Schering-Plough Animal Health's FEVAXYN FeLV) provided effective protection against FeLV challenge. In nearly every recipient of these vaccines, neither viral DNA, RNA, antigen, nor infectious virus could be detected in blood after FeLV challenge. Interestingly, this effective viral containment occurred despite a weak to undetectable VN antibody response. The above findings reinforce the precept of FeLV infection as a unique model of effective retroviral immunity elicited by WIV vaccination, and as such holds valuable insights into retroviral immunoprevention and therapy.","['Torres, Andrea N', ""O'Halloran, Kevin P"", 'Larson, Laurie J', 'Schultz, Ronald D', 'Hoover, Edward A']","['Torres AN', ""O'Halloran KP"", 'Larson LJ', 'Schultz RD', 'Hoover EA']","['Department of Microbiology, Immunology, and Pathology, 1619 Campus Delivery, Colorado State University, Ft.

Here we report the role of TGase II in allergic inflammation. Antigen stimulation induced expression and activity of TGase II by activation of NF-kappaB in rat basophilic leukemia (RBL2H3) cells. This induction of TGase II was dependent on FcepsilonRI and EGFR. Interaction between TGase II and rac1 was induced following antigen stimulation. TGase II was responsible for the increased production of reactive oxygen species, expression of prostaglandin E2 synthase (PGE2 synthase) and was responsible for increased secretion of prostaglandin E2. ChIP assay showed that TGase II, through interaction with NF-kappaB, was responsible for the induction of histone deacetylase-3 (HDAC3) and snail by direct binding to promoter sequences. HDAC3 and snail induced by TGase II, exerted transcriptional repression on E-cadherin. Snail exerted negative effect on expression of MMP-2, and secretion of Th2 cytokines. Inhibition of matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) inhibited secretion of Th2 cytokines. In vivo induction of TGase II was observed in Balb/c mouse model of IgE antibody-induced passive cutaneous anaphylaxis.

Mcl-1 is overexpressed in many malignancies, including pancreatic cancer. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of siRNA targeted against Mcl-1 on the radiosensitivity of human pancreatic carcinoma cells. METHODS: In 3 pancreatic cancer cell lines, the expression of Mcl-1 mRNA was determined by RT-PCR assay, and the dose-dependent cytotoxicity of radiation was also assessed. Furthermore, the effects of adenovirus-mediated siRNA targeted against Mcl-1 on radiosensitivity of PANC-1 cells both in vitro and in vivo were evaluated. RESULTS: Pancreatic cancer cells showed various levels of Mcl-1 mRNA that were correlated with the radiosensitivity of tumor cells. AdU6/shMcl-1 significantly downregulated the expression of Mcl-1 gene in PANC-1 cells, the most radioresistant cell line. Furthermore, Mcl-1 downregulation could significantly enhance radiosensitivity of PANC-1 cells in vitro and in vivo. The mechanism might be correlated with apoptosis enhancement by activating celluar caspase-3. CONCLUSION: Mcl-1 might be a therapeutic target for radiosensitization of pancreatic carcinoma cells. Adenovirus-mediated siRNA targeting of Mcl-1 could enhance the radiosensitivity of pancreatic cancer cells both in vitro and in vivo, and thus might be a potential strategy for ameliorating cancer.","['Guoan, Xiang', 'Hanning, Wang', 'Kaiyun, Chen', 'Hao, Liu']","['Guoan X', 'Hanning W', 'Kaiyun C', 'Hao L']","[""Department of General Surgery, The Second People's Hospital of Guangdong Province, Guangzhou, China.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20091211,United States,Surgery,Surgery,0417347,"['0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)']",IM,"['Adenoviridae/*genetics', 'Apoptosis', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Humans', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Pancreatic Neoplasms/*genetics/radiotherapy', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*genetics/radiation effects', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'RNA, Neoplasm/genetics', 'RNA, Small Interfering/*genetics', 'Radiation Tolerance/radiation effects', 'Sarcoma, Myeloid/genetics']",2009/12/17 06:00,2010/04/24 06:00,['2009/12/17 06:00'],"['2008/11/19 00:00 [received]', '2009/10/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/12/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/12/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/04/24 06:00 [medline]']","['S0039-6060(09)00643-6 [pii]', '10.1016/j.surg.2009.10.033 [doi]']",ppublish,Surgery. 2010 Apr;147(4):553-61. doi: 10.1016/j.surg.2009.10.033.

We show that, in the absence of LIF, GDNF slows the proliferation of maGS cells and result in smaller sized colonies without any change in distribution of cells to different cell-cycle stages, expression of pluripotency genes and in vitro differentiation potential. Furthermore, in the absence of LIF, GDNF increased the expression of male germ-line genes and repopulated the empty seminiferous tubule of W/W(v) mutant mouse without the formation of teratoma. GDNF also altered the genomic imprinting of Igf2, Peg1, and H19 genes but had no effect on DNA methylation of Oct4, Nanog and Stra8 genes. However, these effects of GDNF were masked in the presence of LIF. GDNF also did not interfere with the multipotency of maGS cells if they are cultured in the presence of LIF. In conclusion, our results suggest that, in the absence of LIF, GDNF alters the growth characteristics of maGS cells and partially impart them some of the germline stem (GS) cell-like characteristics.","['Jung, Yoon Hee', 'Gupta, Mukesh Kumar', 'Oh, Shin Hye', 'Uhm, Sang Jun', 'Lee, Hoon Taek']","['Jung YH', 'Gupta MK', 'Oh SH', 'Uhm SJ', 'Lee HT']","['Department of Bioscience and Biotechnology, Bio-Organ Research Center/Animal Resources Research Center, Konkuk University, Hwayang-dong, Gwangjin-Gu, Seoul 143701, South Korea.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20091207,United States,Exp Cell Res,Experimental cell research,0373226,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Glial Cell Line-Derived Neurotrophic Factor)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)']",IM,"['*Adult Stem Cells/drug effects/physiology', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cell Shape', 'Coculture Techniques', 'DNA Methylation', 'Gene Expression/drug effects', 'Genomic Imprinting/drug effects', '*Germ Cells/drug effects/physiology', 'Glial Cell Line-Derived Neurotrophic Factor/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/pharmacology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred DBA', '*Multipotent Stem Cells/drug effects/physiology', 'Seminiferous Tubules/cytology/drug effects', 'Stem Cell Transplantation/adverse effects', 'Teratoma/pathology', 'Tretinoin/pharmacology']",2009/12/17 06:00,2010/03/26 06:00,['2009/12/17 06:00'],"['2009/06/24 00:00 [received]', '2009/11/27 00:00 [revised]', '2009/11/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/12/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/12/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/03/26 06:00 [medline]']","['S0014-4827(09)00520-5 [pii]', '10.1016/j.yexcr.2009.11.021 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Cell Res. 2010 Mar 10;316(5):747-61. doi: 10.1016/j.yexcr.2009.11.021.

Immunohistologic analysis in normal hematopoietic tissue showed strong staining for CD81 in normal germinal center B cells, a cell type in which its increased expression has not been previously recognized. High-dimensional flow cytometry analysis of normal hematopoietic tissue confirmed that among B- and T-cell subsets, germinal center B cells showed the highest level of CD81 expression. In more than 800 neoplastic tissue samples, its expression was also found in most non-Hodgkin lymphomas. Staining for CD81 was rarely seen in multiple myeloma, Hodgkin lymphoma, or myeloid leukemia. In hierarchical cluster analysis of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, staining for CD81 was most similar to other germinal center B cell-associated markers, particularly LMO2. By flow cytometry, CD81 was expressed in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma cells independent of the presence or absence of CD10, another germinal center B-cell marker. The detection of CD81 in routine biopsy samples and its differential expression in lymphoma subtypes, particularly diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, warrant further study to assess CD81 expression and its role in the risk stratification of patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.","['Luo, Robert F', 'Zhao, Shuchun', 'Tibshirani, Robert', 'Myklebust, June H', 'Sanyal, Mrinmoy', 'Fernandez, Rosemary', 'Gratzinger, Dita', 'Marinelli, Robert J', 'Lu, Zhi Shun', 'Wong, Anna', 'Levy, Ronald', 'Levy, Shoshana', 'Natkunam, Yasodha']","['Luo RF', 'Zhao S', 'Tibshirani R', 'Myklebust JH', 'Sanyal M', 'Fernandez R', 'Gratzinger D', 'Marinelli RJ', 'Lu ZS', 'Wong A', 'Levy R', 'Levy S', 'Natkunam Y']","['Department of Pathology, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA 94305, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20091208,United States,Hum Pathol,Human pathology,9421547,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (CD81 protein, human)', '0 (Tetraspanin 28)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD/*metabolism', 'B-Lymphocytes/*metabolism', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Germinal Center/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Lymph Nodes/metabolism', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/*metabolism', 'Palatine Tonsil/metabolism', 'T-Lymphocytes/metabolism', 'Tetraspanin 28', 'Thymus Gland/metabolism', 'Tissue Array Analysis']",2009/12/17 06:00,2010/02/20 06:00,['2009/12/17 06:00'],"['2009/05/08 00:00 [received]', '2009/07/28 00:00 [revised]', '2009/07/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/12/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/12/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/02/20 06:00 [medline]']","['S0046-8177(09)00285-8 [pii]', '10.1016/j.humpath.2009.07.022 [doi]']",ppublish,Hum Pathol. 2010 Feb;41(2):271-80. doi: 10.1016/j.humpath.2009.07.022.

Leukemic cells obtained from 32 B-CLL patients showed a heterogeneous pattern of spontaneous apoptosis at 24 h interval and this pattern permitted to identify: Group 1 (14/32) with high (>20%) apoptotic rate and Group 2 (18/32) with low cell death.

A comparison of these signatures with results from new experiments is useful for verification as well as for interpretation of the results obtained. Currently, the percentage of overlapping genes is frequently used to compare published gene signatures against a signature derived from a new experiment. However, it has been shown that the percentage of overlapping genes is of limited use for comparing two experiments due to the variability of gene signatures caused by different array platforms or assay-specific influencing parameters. Here, we present a robust approach for a systematic and quantitative comparison of published gene expression signatures with an exemplary query dataset. RESULTS: A database storing 138 leukemia-related published gene signatures was designed. Each gene signature was manually annotated with terms according to a leukemia-specific taxonomy. Two analysis steps are implemented to compare a new microarray dataset with the results from previous experiments stored and curated in the database. First, the global test method is applied to assess gene signatures and to constitute a ranking among them. In a subsequent analysis step, the focus is shifted from single gene signatures to chromosomal aberrations or molecular mutations as modeled in the taxonomy. Potentially interesting disease characteristics are detected based on the ranking of gene signatures associated with these aberrations stored in the database. Two example analyses are presented. An implementation of the approach is freely available as web-based application. CONCLUSIONS: The presented approach helps researchers to systematically integrate the knowledge derived from numerous microarray experiments into the analysis of a new dataset. By means of example leukemia datasets we demonstrate that this approach detects related experiments as well as related molecular mutations and may help to interpret new microarray data.","['Klein, Hans-Ulrich', 'Ruckert, Christian', 'Kohlmann, Alexander', 'Bullinger, Lars', 'Thiede, Christian', 'Haferlach, Torsten', 'Dugas, Martin']","['Klein HU', 'Ruckert C', 'Kohlmann A', 'Bullinger L', 'Thiede C', 'Haferlach T', 'Dugas M']","['Department of Medical Informatics and Biomathematics, University of Munster, Domagkstrasse 9, 48149 Munster, Germany. h.klein@uni-muenster.de']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20091215,England,BMC Bioinformatics,BMC bioinformatics,100965194,,IM,"['Computational Biology/*methods', 'Databases, Genetic', '*Gene Expression Profiling', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/classification/*genetics', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis/*methods', 'Software']",2009/12/17 06:00,2010/04/10 06:00,['2009/12/17 06:00'],"['2009/04/11 00:00 [received]', '2009/12/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/12/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/12/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/04/10 06:00 [medline]']","['1471-2105-10-422 [pii]', '10.1186/1471-2105-10-422 [doi]']",epublish,BMC Bioinformatics. 2009 Dec 15;10:422. doi: 10.1186/1471-2105-10-422.,10,,,PMC2803858,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This is due to the ability of AKR1C enzymes to modify androgens, estrogens, progesterone and prostaglandins (PGs) in a tissue-specific manner, regulating the activity of nuclear receptors and other downstream effects. Evidence supporting a role for AKR1C enzymes in cancer derives mostly from studies with isolated primary cells from patients or immortalized cell lines. Mice are ideal organisms for in vivo studies, using knock-out or over-expression strains. However, the functional conservation of AKR1C enzymes between human and mice has yet to be described. RESULTS: In this study, we have characterized and compared the four human (AKR1C1,-1C2, -1C3 and -1C4) and the eight murine (AKR1C6, -1C12, -1C13, -1C14, -1C18, -1C19, -1C20 and -1C21) isoforms in their phylogeny, substrate preference and tissue distribution. We have found divergent evolution between human and murine AKR1C enzymes that was reflected by differing substrate preference. Murine enzymes did not perform the 11beta-ketoreduction of prostaglandin (PG) D2, an activity specific to human AKR1C3 and important in promoting leukemic cell survival. Instead, murine AKR1C6 was able to perform the 9-ketoreduction of PGE2, an activity absent amongst human isoforms. Nevertheless, reduction of the key steroids androstenedione, 5alpha-dihydrotestosterone, progesterone and estrone was found in murine isoforms. However, unlike humans, no AKR1C isoforms were detected in murine prostate, testes, uterus and haemopoietic progenitors. CONCLUSIONS: This study exposes significant lack of phylogenetic and functional homology between human and murine AKR1C enzymes. Therefore, we conclude that mice are not suitable to model the role of AKR1C in human cancers and leukemia.","['Velica, Pedro', 'Davies, Nicholas J', 'Rocha, Pedro P', 'Schrewe, Heinrich', 'Ride, Jonathan P', 'Bunce, Chris M']","['Velica P', 'Davies NJ', 'Rocha PP', 'Schrewe H', 'Ride JP', 'Bunce CM']","['School of Biosciences, University of Birmingham, Edgbaston, B15 2TT Birmingham, UK. p.velica@bham.ac.uk']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20091214,England,Mol Cancer,Molecular cancer,101147698,"['0 (Prostaglandins)', 'EC 1.1.- (Alcohol Oxidoreductases)', 'EC 1.1.1.- (Aldo-Keto Reductases)', 'EC 1.1.1.21 (Aldehyde Reductase)', 'EC 1.1.1.n11 (AKR7A5 protein, mouse)']",IM,"['Alcohol Oxidoreductases/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Aldehyde Reductase', 'Aldo-Keto Reductases', 'Animals', 'Humans', 'Mice', '*Models, Biological', 'Phylogeny', 'Prostaglandins/metabolism', 'Species Specificity', 'Substrate Specificity']",2009/12/17 06:00,2010/04/30 06:00,['2009/12/17 06:00'],"['2009/09/01 00:00 [received]', '2009/12/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/12/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/12/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/04/30 06:00 [medline]']","['1476-4598-8-121 [pii]', '10.1186/1476-4598-8-121 [doi]']",epublish,Mol Cancer. 2009 Dec 14;8:121. doi: 10.1186/1476-4598-8-121.,8,,,PMC2805611,,,['Mol Cancer. 2010;9:21'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Co-analysis of suitable reference genes is crucial for accurate expression normalisation. Reference gene expression may vary, e.g., among species or tissues; thus, candidate genes must be tested prior to use in expression studies. The domestic cat is an important study subject in both medical research and veterinary medicine. The aim of the present study was to develop TaqMan real-time PCR assays for eight potential reference genes and to test their applicability for feline samples, including blood, lymphoid, endocrine, and gastrointestinal tissues from healthy cats, and neoplastic tissues from FeLV-infected cats. RESULTS: RNA extraction from tissues was optimised for minimal genomic DNA (gDNA) contamination without use of a DNase treatment. Real-time PCR assays were established and optimised for v-abl Abelson murine leukaemia viral oncogene homolog (ABL), beta-actin (ACTB), beta-2-microglobulin (B2M), beta-glucuronidase (GUSB), hydroxymethyl-bilane synthase (HMBS), hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase (HPRT), ribosomal protein S7 (RPS7), and tryptophan 5-monooxygenase activation protein, zeta polypeptide (YWHAZ). The presence of pseudogenes was confirmed for four of the eight investigated genes (ACTB, HPRT, RPS7, and YWHAZ). The assays were tested together with previously developed TaqMan assays for feline glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) and the universal 18S rRNA gene. Significant differences were found among the expression levels of the ten candidate reference genes, with a ~106-fold expression difference between the most abundant (18S rRNA) and the least abundant genes (ABL, GUSB, and HMBS). The expression stability determined by the geNorm and NormFinder programs differed significantly. Using the ANOVA-based NormFinder program, RPS7 was the most stable gene in the tissues studied, followed by ACTB and ABL; B2M, HPRT, and the 18S rRNA genes were the least stable ones. CONCLUSION: The reference gene expression stability varied considerably among the feline tissues investigated. No tested gene was optimal for normalisation in all tissues. For the majority of the tissues, two to three reference genes were necessary for accurate normalisation. The present study yields essential information on the correct choice of feline reference genes depending on the tissues analysed.","['Kessler, Yvonne', 'Helfer-Hungerbuehler, A Katrin', 'Cattori, Valentino', 'Meli, Marina L', 'Zellweger, Bigna', 'Ossent, Pete', 'Riond, Barbara', 'Reusch, Claudia E', 'Lutz, Hans', 'Hofmann-Lehmann, Regina']","['Kessler Y', 'Helfer-Hungerbuehler AK', 'Cattori V', 'Meli ML', 'Zellweger B', 'Ossent P', 'Riond B', 'Reusch CE', 'Lutz H', 'Hofmann-Lehmann R']","['University of Zurich, Switzerland. rhofmann@vetclinics.uzh.ch']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20091211,England,BMC Mol Biol,BMC molecular biology,100966983,['EC 2.7.7.- (Taq Polymerase)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Cats/*genetics', 'Female', '*Gene Expression', 'Male', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction/*methods', 'Taq Polymerase/metabolism', 'Time Factors']",2009/12/17 06:00,2010/03/10 06:00,['2009/12/17 06:00'],"['2009/04/27 00:00 [received]', '2009/12/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/12/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/12/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/03/10 06:00 [medline]']","['1471-2199-10-106 [pii]', '10.1186/1471-2199-10-106 [doi]']",epublish,BMC Mol Biol. 2009 Dec 11;10:106. doi: 10.1186/1471-2199-10-106.,10,,,PMC2803789,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Despite improved prognosis, metastatic or relapsed OS remains largely incurable and no significant improvement has been observed in the last 20 years. Therefore, the search for alternative agents in OS is mandatory. RESULTS: We investigated phospho-ERK 1/2, MCL-1, and phospho-Ezrin/Radixin/Moesin (P-ERM) as potential therapeutic targets in OS. Activation of these pathways was shown by immunohistochemistry in about 70% of cases and in all OS cell lines analyzed. Mutational analysis revealed no activating mutations in KRAS whereas BRAF gene was found to be mutated in 4/30 OS samples from patients. Based on these results we tested the multi-kinase inhibitor sorafenib (BAY 43-9006) in preclinical models of OS. Sorafenib inhibited OS cell line proliferation, induced apoptosis and downregulated P-ERK1/2, MCL-1, and P-ERM in a dose-dependent manner. The dephosphorylation of ERM was not due to ERK inhibition. The downregulation of MCL-1 led to an increase in apoptosis in OS cell lines. In chick embryo chorioallantoic membranes, OS supernatants induced angiogenesis, which was blocked by sorafenib and it was also shown that sorafenib reduced VEGF and MMP2 production. In addition, sorafenib treatment dramatically reduced tumour volume of OS xenografts and lung metastasis in SCID mice. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, ERK1/2, MCL-1 and ERM pathways are shown to be active in OS. Sorafenib is able to inhibit their signal transduction, both in vitro and in vivo, displaying anti-tumoural activity, anti-angiogenic effects, and reducing metastatic colony formation in lungs. These data support the testing of sorafenib as a potential therapeutic option in metastatic or relapsed OS patients unresponsive to standard treatments.","['Pignochino, Ymera', 'Grignani, Giovanni', 'Cavalloni, Giuliana', 'Motta, Manuela', 'Tapparo, Marta', 'Bruno, Stefania', 'Bottos, Alessia', 'Gammaitoni, Loretta', 'Migliardi, Giorgia', 'Camussi, Giovanni', 'Alberghini, Marco', 'Torchio, Bruno', 'Ferrari, Stefano', 'Bussolino, Federico', 'Fagioli, Franca', 'Picci, Piero', 'Aglietta, Massimo']","['Pignochino Y', 'Grignani G', 'Cavalloni G', 'Motta M', 'Tapparo M', 'Bruno S', 'Bottos A', 'Gammaitoni L', 'Migliardi G', 'Camussi G', 'Alberghini M', 'Torchio B', 'Ferrari S', 'Bussolino F', 'Fagioli F', 'Picci P', 'Aglietta M']","[""Division of Medical Oncology, University of Torino Medical School, A,O, Ordine Mauriziano, Institute for Cancer Research and Treatment Candiolo, and Regina Margherita Children's Hospital, Torino, Italy. ymera.pignochino@ircc.it""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20091210,England,Mol Cancer,Molecular cancer,101147698,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzenesulfonates)', '0 (Cytoskeletal Proteins)', '0 (Matrix Metalloproteinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Mcl1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Phenylurea Compounds)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Pyridines)', '0 (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A)', '0 (ezrin)', '25X51I8RD4 (Niacinamide)', '9ZOQ3TZI87 (Sorafenib)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases)', 'EC 3.4.24.24 (Matrix Metalloproteinase 2)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Benzenesulfonates/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cytoskeletal Proteins/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Down-Regulation/drug effects', 'Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Matrix Metalloproteinase 2/biosynthesis', 'Matrix Metalloproteinase Inhibitors', 'Mice', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Neoplasm Metastasis/prevention & control', 'Neovascularization, Pathologic/prevention & control', 'Niacinamide/analogs & derivatives', 'Osteosarcoma/blood supply/*drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Phenylurea Compounds', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Pyridines/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Sorafenib', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A/antagonists & inhibitors/biosynthesis']",2009/12/17 06:00,2010/04/30 06:00,['2009/12/17 06:00'],"['2009/09/14 00:00 [received]', '2009/12/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/12/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/12/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/04/30 06:00 [medline]']","['1476-4598-8-118 [pii]', '10.1186/1476-4598-8-118 [doi]']",epublish,Mol Cancer. 2009 Dec 10;8:118. doi: 10.1186/1476-4598-8-118.,8,,,PMC2804605,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Cancer mortality in Japanese A-bomb survivors exposed to less than 20 mSv external radiation in 1945 was analysed previously, using a latency model with non-linear dose response. Questions were raised regarding statistical inference with this model. METHODS: Cancers with over 100 deaths in the 0 - 20 mSv subcohort of the 1950-1990 Life Span Study are analysed with Poisson regression models incorporating latency, allowing linear and non-linear dose response. Bootstrap percentile and Bias-corrected accelerated (BCa) methods and simulation of the Likelihood Ratio Test lead to Confidence Intervals for Excess Relative Risk (ERR) and tests against the linear model. RESULTS: The linear model shows significant large, positive values of ERR for liver and urinary cancers at latencies from 37 - 43 years. Dose response below 20 mSv is strongly non-linear at the optimal latencies for the stomach (11.89 years), liver (36.9), lung (13.6), leukaemia (23.66), and pancreas (11.86) and across broad latency ranges. Confidence Intervals for ERR are comparable using Bootstrap and Likelihood Ratio Test methods and BCa 95% Confidence Intervals are strictly positive across latency ranges for all 5 cancers. Similar risk estimates for 10 mSv (lagged dose) are obtained from the 0 - 20 mSv and 5 - 500 mSv data for the stomach, liver, lung and leukaemia. Dose response for the latter 3 cancers is significantly non-linear in the 5 - 500 mSv range. CONCLUSION: Liver and urinary cancer mortality risk is significantly raised using a latency model with linear dose response. A non-linear model is strongly superior for the stomach, liver, lung, pancreas and leukaemia. Bootstrap and Likelihood-based confidence intervals are broadly comparable and ERR is strictly positive by bootstrap methods for all 5 cancers. Except for the pancreas, similar estimates of latency and risk from 10 mSv are obtained from the 0 - 20 mSv and 5 - 500 mSv subcohorts. Large and significant cancer risks for Japanese survivors exposed to less than 20 mSv external radiation from the atomic bombs in 1945 cast doubt on the ICRP recommended annual occupational dose limit.","['Dropkin, Greg']",['Dropkin G'],['gregd@gn.apc.org'],['eng'],['Journal Article'],20091209,England,Environ Health,Environmental health : a global access science source,101147645,['0 (Radioactive Fallout)'],IM,"['Female', 'Humans', 'Japan/epidemiology', 'Leukemia/mortality', 'Linear Models', 'Liver Neoplasms/mortality', 'Male', 'Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced/*mortality', '*Nuclear Weapons', 'Pancreatic Neoplasms/mortality', '*Radiation Dosage', 'Radiation Monitoring/*methods', 'Radioactive Fallout', 'Reaction Time', 'Stomach Neoplasms/mortality', 'Survivors', 'Urologic Neoplasms/mortality']",2009/12/17 06:00,2010/01/15 06:00,['2009/12/17 06:00'],"['2009/02/03 00:00 [received]', '2009/12/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/12/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/12/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/01/15 06:00 [medline]']","['1476-069X-8-56 [pii]', '10.1186/1476-069X-8-56 [doi]']",epublish,Environ Health. 2009 Dec 9;8:56. doi: 10.1186/1476-069X-8-56.,8,,,PMC2799447,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Clinical, laboratory, overall survival (OS) and treatment-free survival (TFS) data were collected on 130 CLL patients who had CD38 expression analysed at Canterbury Health Laboratories, New Zealand (NZ) during 1998-2008. RESULTS: The detection of any level of CD38 expression by CLL cells was associated with a significantly shorter OS and TFS. When analysis was restricted to Binet stage A patients, CD38 expression identified a subset of patients (21%) who, in common with Binet stage B/C patients, had a significantly shorter OS and TFS (P<0.0015), and a TFS at 4 years of <10%. In contrast, CD38-negative Binet stage A patients had an OS that was not significantly different from that of an age/sex-matched NZ population and a 5-year TFS of 77%. CONCLUSION: This study indicates that, when combined with clinical staging, the presence of any detectable CD38 expression can be used to further improve the identification of CLL patients with more aggressive disease (i.e. Binet stage B/C or Binet stage A and CD38 positive). This will allow better identification of those patients requiring more intensive monitoring and also allow improved patient counselling regarding prognosis.","['Hock, B D', 'McKenzie, J L', 'McArthur, L', 'Tansley, S', 'Taylor, K G', 'Fernyhough, L J']","['Hock BD', 'McKenzie JL', 'McArthur L', 'Tansley S', 'Taylor KG', 'Fernyhough LJ']","['Haematology Research Group, Haematology Department, Christchurch Hospital, Department of Pathology, University of Otago, Christchurch, New Zealand.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",,Australia,Intern Med J,Internal medicine journal,101092952,"['0 (Biomarkers)', 'EC 3.2.2.6 (ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1)']",IM,"['ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1/biosynthesis/*blood', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Biomarkers/blood', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*blood/*mortality/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'New Zealand', 'Prognosis', 'Sex Factors', 'Survival Rate/trends', 'Young Adult']",2009/12/17 06:00,2011/12/13 00:00,['2009/12/17 06:00'],"['2009/12/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/12/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/12/13 00:00 [medline]']","['IMJ2135 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1445-5994.2009.02135.x [doi]']",ppublish,Intern Med J. 2010 Dec;40(12):842-9. doi: 10.1111/j.1445-5994.2009.02135.x.,40,,,,,,,"['(c) 2010 The Authors.

We have developed an outpatient treatment programme for patients with acute leukaemia incorporating comprehensive patient education for self-care management at home during pancytopenia and involvement of patients in care of their tunnelled central venous catheter (CVC). During neutropenia, patients are treated with prophylactic ciprofloxacine, amoxicillin/clavulanic acid and fluconazole. Herein, we report the results of outpatient treatment of 60 patients with acute leukaemia (54 with acute myeloid leukaemia) followed prospectively in the period from March 2004 to 2007. After induction chemotherapy, outpatient treatment was possible after 48 of 73 induction courses, with no readmission in 19 of these (40%). A total of 129 consolidation courses were administered with outpatient treatment following 116 of these, with no readmission in 69 (59%). The median number of days spent at home with neutrophils below 0.5 x 10(9)/L was 8 d per course following induction and 12 d following consolidation chemotherapy. The predominant cause of readmission was neutropenic fever, in most instances of unknown origin.

Accumulating evidence has indicated that two common genetic variants, C677T and A1298C, are associated with cancer risk. We hypothesized that these two variants were associated with childhood ALL susceptibility and influence serum MTHFR levels. We genotyped these two polymorphisms and detected MTHFR levels in a case-control study of 361 cases and 508 controls. Compared with the 677CC and 677CC/CT genotypes, the 677TT genotype was associated with a statistically significantly decreased risk of childhood ALL (odds ratio = 0.53, 95% confidence interval = 0.32-0.88, and odds ratio = 0.55, 95% confidence interval = 0.35-0.88, respectively). In addition, a pronounced reduced risk of ALL was observed among low-risk ALL and B-phenotype ALL. Moreover, the mean serum MTHFR level was 8.01 ng/mL (+/-4.38) in cases and 9.27 ng/mL (+/-4.80) in controls (P < 0.001). MTHFR levels in subjects with 677TT genotype was significantly higher than those with 677CC genotype (P = 0.010) or 677CT genotype (P = 0.043) in controls. In conclusion, our results provide evidence that the MTHFR polymorphisms might contribute to reduced childhood ALL risk in this population.","['Tong, Na', 'Fang, Yongjun', 'Li, Jie', 'Wang, Meilin', 'Lu, Qin', 'Wang, Shizhi', 'Tian, Yuanyuan', 'Rong, Liucheng', 'Sun, Jielin', 'Xu, Jianfeng', 'Zhang, Zhengdong']","['Tong N', 'Fang Y', 'Li J', 'Wang M', 'Lu Q', 'Wang S', 'Tian Y', 'Rong L', 'Sun J', 'Xu J', 'Zhang Z']","['Department of Molecular and Genetic Toxicology, Cancer Center of Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20091111,England,Cancer Sci,Cancer science,101168776,['EC 1.5.1.20 (Methylenetetrahydrofolate Reductase (NADPH2))'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Genotype', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Methylenetetrahydrofolate Reductase (NADPH2)/blood/*genetics', '*Polymorphism, Genetic', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/enzymology/etiology/*genetics', 'Risk']",2009/12/17 06:00,2010/04/17 06:00,['2009/12/17 06:00'],"['2009/12/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/12/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/04/17 06:00 [medline]']","['CAS1429 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1349-7006.2009.01429.x [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Sci. 2010 Mar;101(3):782-6. doi: 10.1111/j.1349-7006.2009.01429.x.

METHODS: We established cell lines from a patient with Ph(+) ALL at the time of first diagnosis and relapsed phase and designated as NPhA1 and NPhA2, respectively. We also derived IM-resistant cells, NPhA2/STIR, from NPhA2 under gradually increasing IM concentrations. RESULTS: NPhA1 was sensitive to IM (IC(50) 0.05 microm) and NPhA2 showed mild IM resistance (IC(50) 0.3 microm). NPhA2/STIR could be maintained in the presence of 10 microm IM. Phosphorylation of MEK and ERK was slightly elevated in NPhA2 and significantly elevated in NPhA2/STIR compared to NPhA1 cells. After treatment with IM, phosphorylation of MEK and ERK was not suppressed but rather increased in NPhA2 and NPhA2/STIR. Active RAS was also increased markedly in NPhA2/STIR after IM treatment. The expression of BCL-2 was increased in NPhA2 compared to NPhA1, but no further increase in NPhA2/STIR. Proliferation of NPhA2/STIR was significantly inhibited by a combination of MEK inhibitor and IM. Analysis of tyrosine phosphorylation status with a protein tyrosine kinase array showed increased phosphorylation of EphB4 in NPhA2/STIR after IM treatment. Although transcription of EphB4 was suppressed in NPhA1 and NPhA2 after IM treatment, it was not suppressed and its ligand, ephrinB2, was increased in NPhA2/STIR. Suppression of EphB4 transcripts by introducing short hairpin RNA into NPhA2/STIR partially restored their sensitivity to IM. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest a new mechanism of IM resistance mediated by the activation of RAS/MAPK pathway and EphB4.","['Suzuki, Momoko', 'Abe, Akihiro', 'Imagama, Shizuka', 'Nomura, Yuka', 'Tanizaki, Ryohei', 'Minami, Yosuke', 'Hayakawa, Fumihiko', 'Ito, Yoshie', 'Katsumi, Akira', 'Yamamoto, Kazuhito', 'Emi, Nobuhiko', 'Kiyoi, Hitoshi', 'Naoe, Tomoki']","['Suzuki M', 'Abe A', 'Imagama S', 'Nomura Y', 'Tanizaki R', 'Minami Y', 'Hayakawa F', 'Ito Y', 'Katsumi A', 'Yamamoto K', 'Emi N', 'Kiyoi H', 'Naoe T']","['Department of Hematology and Oncology, Nagoya University Graduate School of Medicine, Nagoya 466-8550, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20091128,England,Eur J Haematol,European journal of haematology,8703985,"['0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Ephrin-B2)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor, EphB4)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (ras Proteins)']",IM,"['Benzamides', 'Cell Line, Tumor/drug effects/enzymology', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*physiology', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Enzyme Induction', 'Ephrin-B2/genetics/physiology', 'Female', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'MAP Kinase Signaling System/physiology', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*physiology', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Piperazines/*pharmacology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*enzymology/pathology', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Protein Processing, Post-Translational/drug effects', 'Pyrimidines/*pharmacology', 'RNA, Small Interfering/pharmacology', 'Receptor, EphB4/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*physiology', 'Recurrence', 'ras Proteins/*physiology']",2009/12/17 06:00,2010/03/27 06:00,['2009/12/17 06:00'],"['2009/12/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/12/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/03/27 06:00 [medline]']","['EJH1387 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1600-0609.2009.01387.x [doi]']",ppublish,Eur J Haematol. 2010 Mar;84(3):229-38. doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0609.2009.01387.x.

In contrast, apart from MTX, retrospective controls received high-dose CsA, starting at 5-7.5 mg/kg per day i.v. and discontinued 1 yr post-transplant. In the low-dose CsA group, the probability of acute GVHD grades I-II (70% vs. 53%, P < 0.01), and chronic GVHD were increased (58% vs. 25%, P < 0.01), whereas the incidences of acute GVHD grades III-IV (9% vs. 5%, P = 0.62), and non-relapse mortality (20% vs. 22%, P = 0.58) were similar.

It is, therefore, not surprising that recurrent chromosome 1 abnormalities are regularly encountered in both neoplastic and non-neoplastic medical conditions. The current review is focused on myeloid malignancies where we summarize the relevant published literature and discuss specific karyotype-phenotype associations. We show that chromosome 1 abnormalities are most frequent in BCR-ABL-negative classic myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN): polycythemia vera (PV), essential thrombocythemia (ET), and primary myelofibrosis (PMF). Specific abnormalities include duplications (e.g. 1q12-->1q32 in PV, 1q21-32-->1q32-44 in post-PV MF or PMF), deletions (e.g. 1p13-36-->pter in PV or PMF, 1q21 in PMF) and unbalanced translocations involving chromosome 6, such as der(6)t(1;6)(q21-25;p21.3-23), and other partner chromosomes involving 1q10/1p11 and 1q21-25 breakpoints. Although occasionally seen in chronic phase MPN, unbalanced 1;7 translocations, e.g. der(1;7)(q10;p10), are usually seen in acute myeloid leukemia (AML), myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), and post-MPN AML/MDS. These observations suggest that certain chromosome 1 regions, especially 1q21-1q32 and 1p11-13, might harbor oncogenes or tumor suppressor genes that are pathogenetically relevant to both chronic and advanced phases of MPN.","['Caramazza, Domenica', 'Hussein, Kebede', 'Siragusa, Sergio', 'Pardanani, Animesh', 'Knudson, Ryan A', 'Ketterling, Rhett P', 'Tefferi, Ayalew']","['Caramazza D', 'Hussein K', 'Siragusa S', 'Pardanani A', 'Knudson RA', 'Ketterling RP', 'Tefferi A']","['Cattedra ed U.O. di Ematologia, Policlinico Universitario di Palermo, Palermo, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20091130,England,Eur J Haematol,European journal of haematology,8703985,,IM,"['*Chromosome Aberrations', 'Chromosome Deletion', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 1/genetics/ultrastructure', 'Genes, Tumor Suppressor', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*genetics', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*genetics', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/*genetics', 'Oncogenes', 'Phenotype', 'Translocation, Genetic']",2009/12/17 06:00,2010/03/27 06:00,['2009/12/17 06:00'],"['2009/12/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/12/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/03/27 06:00 [medline]']","['EJH1392 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1600-0609.2009.01392.x [doi]']",ppublish,Eur J Haematol. 2010 Mar;84(3):191-200. doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0609.2009.01392.x.

In the present study, we have demonstrated that Ets-1 p51, but not the spliced variant Ets-1 p42, is processed in a caspase-dependent manner in Jurkat T-leukaemia cells undergoing apoptosis, resulting in three C-terminal fragments Cp20, Cp17 and Cp14 and a N-terminal fragment, Np36. In vitro cleavage of Ets-1 p51 by caspase 3 produces fragments consistent with those observed in cells undergoing apoptosis. These fragments are generated by cleavage at three sites located in the exon VII-encoded region of Ets-1 p51. This region is absent from the Ets-1 p42 isoform, which therefore cannot be cleaved by caspases. In Ets-1 p51, cleavage generates C-terminal fragments containing the DNA-binding domain, but lacking the transactivation domain. The Cp17 fragment, the major cleavage product generated during apoptosis, is devoid of transcriptional activity and inhibits Ets-1 p51-mediated transactivation of target genes by competing with Ets-1 p51 for binding to Ets-binding sites present in the target promoters. In the present study, we have demonstrated that caspase cleavage of Ets-1 within the exon VII-encoded region leads to specific down-regulation of the Ets-1 p51 isoform during apoptosis. Furthermore, our results establish that caspase cleavage generates a stable C-terminal fragment that acts as a natural dominant-negative form of the full-length Ets-1 p51 protein.","['Choul-Li, Souhaila', 'Leroy, Catherine', 'Leprivier, Gabriel', 'Laitem, Clelia', 'Tulasne, David', 'Aumercier, Marc']","['Choul-Li S', 'Leroy C', 'Leprivier G', 'Laitem C', 'Tulasne D', 'Aumercier M']","['CNRS UMR 8161, Institut de Biologie de Lille, Institut Pasteur de Lille, Universite Lille Nord de France, IFR 142, B.P. 447, 1 rue Calmette, 59021 Lille Cedex, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100209,England,Biochem J,The Biochemical journal,2984726R,"['0 (ETS1 protein, human)', '0 (Protein Isoforms)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Protein c-ets-1)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Motifs', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Caspase 3/genetics/*metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Humans', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutation', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Isoforms/chemistry/genetics/metabolism', '*Protein Processing, Post-Translational', 'Proto-Oncogene Protein c-ets-1/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Sequence Alignment', '*Transcriptional Activation']",2009/12/17 06:00,2010/03/06 06:00,['2009/12/17 06:00'],"['2009/12/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/12/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/03/06 06:00 [medline]']","['BJ20090877 [pii]', '10.1042/BJ20090877 [doi]']",epublish,Biochem J. 2010 Feb 9;426(2):229-41. doi: 10.1042/BJ20090877.,426,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In an attempt to identify more factors associated with MDR for an understanding of the mechanism, we first established an adriamycin (ADR)-resistant human erythroleukemia cell line K562/ADR by stepwise selection in vitro using ADR. Besides the elevated resistance to ADR, the K562/ADR cells also showed significantly increased crossed-resistance to vincristin and Gleevec, compared to the parental K562 cells. Then we compared the global protein profiles between K562 and K562/ADR cells. Following two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and image analysis, some of the proteins with different levels between the two cell lines were identified by MALDI TOF/TOF mass spectrometry and Western blot analysis. The differentially expressed proteins were classified into groups based on their functions: calcium-binding proteins, chaperones, metabolic enzymes, proteins related to protein synthesis or DNA synthesis, and proteins related to signal transduction. In particular, ANXA1, a protein that was downregulated in K562/ADR, was analyzed further for its involvement in MDR by transfection and subsequent assays. The functional validation showed that the downregulated ANXA1 expression contributes considerably to the observed drug resistance in K562/ADR cells. These data will be valuable for further study of the mechanisms of MDR and may reveal a potential new diagnostic marker to chemotherapy.","['Zhu, Fengjia', 'Wang, Yi', 'Zeng, Su', 'Fu, Xiaoyun', 'Wang, Linbo', 'Cao, Jiang']","['Zhu F', 'Wang Y', 'Zeng S', 'Fu X', 'Wang L', 'Cao J']","[""Sir Run Run Shaw Institute of Clinical Medicine, College of Medicine, Zhejiang University and Key Laboratory of Biotherapy of Zhejiang Province , Hangzhou, People's Republic of China.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,OMICS,Omics : a journal of integrative biology,101131135,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Annexin A1)', '0 (Calcium-Binding Proteins)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/metabolism', 'Animals', 'Annexin A1/genetics/*metabolism', 'Calcium-Binding Proteins/metabolism', 'Doxorubicin/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Drug Resistance, Multiple/*physiology', 'Humans', '*K562 Cells/drug effects/physiology', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/drug therapy', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/drug therapy', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Protein Array Analysis', 'Proteomics/*methods', 'Spectrometry, Mass, Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption-Ionization']",2009/12/17 06:00,2010/03/02 06:00,['2009/12/17 06:00'],"['2009/12/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/12/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/03/02 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1089/omi.2009.0046 [doi]'],ppublish,OMICS. 2009 Dec;13(6):467-76. doi: 10.1089/omi.2009.0046.,13,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These covariates included demographics, mucositis, neutropenia, vomiting, diarrhea, proton pump inhibitor (PPI) or H(2)-receptor antagonist usage and baseline bilirubin or baseline gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT) levels > or =2 x upper limit of normal (ULN). A correlation between posaconazole PK and the occurrence of invasive fungal infection (IFI) was also examined. RESULTS: Statistically significant associations were demonstrated between posaconazole PK and diarrhea, PPI intake, race, and baseline GGT and bilirubin levels. These covariates did not predominate in patients who developed IFI. CONCLUSION: This analysis provides information regarding the correlation of patient covariates with posaconazole exposures estimated in a clinical setting. The results of this analysis agree with previously reported analyses. However, because of the successful prophylaxis and the low number of posaconazole-treated patients with IFI proven or probable (IFIPP), the absence of a statistically significant relationship between IFIPP and exposure may not mean this relationship does not exist. A meta-analysis of several efficacy trials or exploring alternate composite endpoints for efficacy may be needed to answer this question.","['AbuTarif, M A', 'Krishna, G', 'Statkevich, P']","['AbuTarif MA', 'Krishna G', 'Statkevich P']","['Schering-Plough Research Institute, 2015 Galloping Hill Road, Kenilworth, NJ 07033, USA. mabutarif@gmail.com']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Curr Med Res Opin,Current medical research and opinion,0351014,"['0 (Antifungal Agents)', '0 (Triazoles)', '6TK1G07BHZ (posaconazole)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antibiotic Prophylaxis/methods', 'Antifungal Agents/pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mycoses/etiology/*prevention & control', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Neutropenia/*chemically induced/complications/metabolism', 'Population', 'Single-Blind Method', 'Triazoles/*pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use', 'Young Adult']",2009/12/17 06:00,2010/05/01 06:00,['2009/12/17 06:00'],"['2009/12/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/12/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/05/01 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1185/03007990903485056 [doi]'],ppublish,Curr Med Res Opin. 2010 Feb;26(2):397-405. doi: 10.1185/03007990903485056.,26,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The increased incidence of second cancers in HCL has been documented in large epidemiologic studies conducted in various locations on the globe. AREAS COVERED IN THIS REVIEW: The authors explore the current clinico-epidemiologic evidence, as well as the immune alterations, that link HCL and its therapies to the development of second cancers. Most relevant publications have been identified through the PubMed/Medline database search. WHAT THE READER WILL GAIN: Although HCL patients could develop both HCL and secondary malignancies because of a shared genetic predisposition, a common environmental carcinogen, or not yet identified infectious agents, multiple immune defects documented in HCL might play an important role in second carcinogenesis. Furthermore, the 'gold standards' of HCL therapy - cladribine and pentostatin - are associated with profound and prolonged suppression of the CD4(+) T-lymphocyte counts, often in excess of 2 - 3 years. And while there is no clear-cut evidence that pentostatin or interferon-alpha play an established role in generation of an excess of second cancers in HCL, the safety of cladribine, the preferred agent by a majority of clinicians worldwide, in this regard is a still largely unsettled issue. TAKE-HOME MESSAGE: Therefore, it remains to be seen if the immune deficiencies induced by the HCL therapies and their consequences can be offset by the benefit conferred by controlling the leukemic process.","['Dasanu, Constantin A', 'Alexandrescu, Doru T']","['Dasanu CA', 'Alexandrescu DT']","['St Francis Hospital and Medical Center, Department of Hematology-Oncology, Gothic Park, 43 Woodland Street, G-80, Hartford, CT 06105, USA. c_dasanu@yahoo.com']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,England,Expert Opin Pharmacother,Expert opinion on pharmacotherapy,100897346,"['395575MZO7 (Pentostatin)', '47M74X9YT5 (Cladribine)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols', 'Cladribine/*therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Leukemia, Hairy Cell/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Male', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/*complications/epidemiology', 'Pentostatin/*therapeutic use']",2009/12/17 06:00,2010/04/29 06:00,['2009/12/17 06:00'],"['2009/12/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/12/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/04/29 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1517/14656560903405647 [doi]'],ppublish,Expert Opin Pharmacother. 2010 Jan;11(1):41-50. doi: 10.1517/14656560903405647.,11,,,,,54,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We compared hospital and 6-month survival in patients with ATLS with hematological malignancies with or without acute renal injury. Sixty-three patients (median age, 50 years; range, 32-64) were included with ATLS. Twenty-eight had no ARI (including 17 (61%) who subsequently required dialysis) whereas 35 had an ATLS-related ARI (including 31 (89%) who required dialysis). Acute leukemia (n = 28) and lymphoma (n = 30) were the main malignancies. All patients had high tumor burdens. Hospital and 6-month mortality rates were significantly lower in patients without ARI (7% and 21%, respectively) than in the ATLS-related renal injury group (51% and 66%). After adjustment for acute disease severity, presence of ARI at ICU admission was associated with higher hospital mortality (odds ratio, 10.41; 95% confidence interval, 2.01-19.170; p = 0.005) and 6-month mortality (odds ratio, 5.61; 95% confidence interval, 1.64-54.66; p = 0.006), compared to patients without renal injury.

The outcome for patients who receive conventional chemotherapy alone is poor, with remission duration of around 12 months and disease-free survival (DFS) rates of not more than 10%. Allogeneic stem cell transplantation (alloSCT) has been the only known curative treatment option, but is limited by the availability of a matched donor and the risk of treatment-related mortality. Given the role of BCR-ABL in the leukemogenesis of Ph+ ALL, current treatments have focused on inhibition of this oncogenic tyrosine kinase. Early studies demonstrate that the use of the BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI), imatinib, before alloSCT results in improved response rates and DFS when combined with standard chemotherapy regimens. Remission duration also is improved when combination chemotherapy and imatinib are administered intensively, even in the absence of allogeneic stem cell transplant. However, resistant disease remains an important problem, and the mechanisms underlying resistance in Ph+ ALL are multifactorial. Novel TKIs are currently under development and are effective in some patients with imatinib-resistant disease. The dual BCR-ABL/SRC family kinase inhibitor, dasatinib, has shown promising activity in the treatment of Ph+ ALL after imatinib failure and has recently been approved in this indication. Other TKI-based therapies are also showing potential in imatinib-resistant disease. This article reviews current and emerging treatments in Ph+ ALL.","['Stock, Wendy']",['Stock W'],"['Department of Medicine, Section of Hematology and Oncology, University of Chicago and University of Chicago Cancer Research Center, Chicago, IL 60637-1463, USA. wstock@medicine.bsd.uchicago.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",,United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,"['0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Thiazoles)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'F41401512X (nilotinib)', 'RBZ1571X5H (Dasatinib)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Benzamides', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Dasatinib', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Piperazines/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/genetics/metabolism', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'Pyrimidines/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Thiazoles/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use']",2009/12/17 06:00,2010/04/24 06:00,['2009/12/17 06:00'],"['2009/12/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/12/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/04/24 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3109/10428190903452834 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2010 Feb;51(2):188-98. doi: 10.3109/10428190903452834.,51,,,,,101,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We report a case of a 9-month-old child, without a known diagnosis of neurofibromatosis 1, who presented with hepatosplenomegaly, anemia, thrombocytopenia, and multiple cutaneous nodules, which were confirmed to be juvenile xanthogranulomas upon biopsy. A concurrent work-up showed that the child had juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia. Although cutaneous juvenile xanthogranulomas are benign lesions, in several reported cases they have been shown to herald leukemia. This association between xanthogranulomas and hematologic malignancy is poorly understood. Juvenile xanthogranulomas have a number of morphologic variants and clinical presentations that can be confused with the cutaneous lesions of Langerhans cell histiocytosis and dermatofibroma.

Transferrin was coupled to the surface of liposomes encapsulating siRNA or asODN through the postinsertion method. Cell association and internalization were assessed by flow cytometry and confocal microscopy, respectively. BCR-ABL mRNA and Bcr-Abl protein levels were evaluated by qRT-PCR and Western blot, respectively. Cell viability was assessed using the resazurin reduction method. The amount of coupled transferrin and the size and stability over time of the liposomes were very satisfactory and reproducible. The siRNA encapsulation yield was dependent on the concentration of the encapsulation buffer used (20 or 300 mM), as opposed to asODN encapsulation yield which was high for both concentrations tested. Cell association and internalization studies were performed in leukemia cell lines treated with liposomes coupled to Trf (Trf-liposomes) or albumin (BSA-liposomes) or with nontargeted liposomes (NT-liposomes) encapsulating fluorescently labeled siRNA (Cy3-siRNA). These experiments clearly indicated that BSA- and NT-liposomes have no ability to promote the delivery of the encapsulated nucleic acids and that the Trf-liposomes deliver the nucleic acids by a Trf receptor-dependent mechanism. The Trf-liposomes encapsulating siRNA or asODN promote sequence-specific down-regulation of the BCR-ABL mRNA, although a certain extent of nonspecific sequence effects at the protein and cell viability level were observed. Overall, our results indicate that Trf-liposomes encapsulating gene silencing tools allow combining molecular and cellular targeting, which is a valuable approach for cancer treatment.","['Mendonca, Liliana S', 'Firmino, Filipe', 'Moreira, Joao N', 'Pedroso de Lima, Maria C', 'Simoes, Sergio']","['Mendonca LS', 'Firmino F', 'Moreira JN', 'Pedroso de Lima MC', 'Simoes S']","['Department of Biochemistry, University of Coimbra, Coimbra, Portugal.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Bioconjug Chem,Bioconjugate chemistry,9010319,"['0 (Fluorescent Dyes)', '0 (Liposomes)', '0 (Oligodeoxyribonucleotides, Antisense)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (Receptors, Transferrin)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Blotting, Western', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Down-Regulation/drug effects/genetics', 'Drug Delivery Systems/*methods', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Fluorescent Dyes/chemistry', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/*genetics', 'Liposomes', 'Microscopy, Confocal', 'Oligodeoxyribonucleotides, Antisense/administration & dosage/genetics/pharmacology', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'RNA, Small Interfering/*administration & dosage/*genetics/pharmacology', 'Receptors, Transferrin/*metabolism']",2009/12/17 06:00,2010/05/21 06:00,['2009/12/17 06:00'],"['2009/12/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/12/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/05/21 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1021/bc9004365 [doi]'],ppublish,Bioconjug Chem. 2010 Jan;21(1):157-68. doi: 10.1021/bc9004365.,21,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Information on place of birth was frequently absent for non-deceased cases, therefore data were limited to deceased cases. Age- and gender-standardized proportional ratios (SPR) were calculated for 24 aggregated cancer sites. Significantly high or low SPRs were observed for Arabic immigrants for the following cancer sites: liver (3.15), gallbladder & other biliary (1.87), thyroid (1.74), stomach (1.54), leukemia (1.41), lymphoma (1.36), pancreas (1.36), ovary (1.29), brain and other nervous system (1.23), lung (0.80), prostate (0.72), oral cavity and pharynx (0.64), esophagus (0.39), and skin melanoma (0.33).

So far, published data are only available on the average telomere length in myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML), but not on the telomere length of individual chromosomes. We used a new technique, telomere/centromere-fluorescence in situ hybridization (T/C-FISH), which combines fluorescence R-banding and FISH using a probe against the telomere repeats to measure the telomere length of each chromosome arm in 78 patients with MDS. In line with the previous results, patients with MDS showed significantly shorter telomeres than those of healthy controls. Telomere lengths did not differ significantly between distinct morphological subtypes of MDS. However, there was a significant difference in telomere length between patients with an isolated monosomy 7 and patients with a normal karyotype (P < 0.05). Notably, patients with an isolated monosomy 7 showed significantly longer telomeres than patients with a normal karyotype in many chromosome arms, among them 7p and 7q. Neo-telomeres were found in two patients with a complex karyotype, in one case at the fusion site of a dic(14;20). Normal and aberrant metaphases of the same patient did not differ in telomere length, thus indicating to telomere shortening as a basic mechanism affecting all hematopoietic cells in patients with MDS. In some MDS subtypes, like MDS with isolated monosomy 7, telomeres may be stabilized and even increase in length because of the activation of telomerase or alternative mechanisms.","['Lange, Kathrin', 'Holm, Lisa', 'Vang Nielsen, Kirsten', 'Hahn, Andreas', 'Hofmann, Winfried', 'Kreipe, Hans', 'Schlegelberger, Brigitte', 'Gohring, Gudrun']","['Lange K', 'Holm L', 'Vang Nielsen K', 'Hahn A', 'Hofmann W', 'Kreipe H', 'Schlegelberger B', 'Gohring G']","['Institute of Cell and Molecular Pathology, Hannover Medical School, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Genes Chromosomes Cancer,"Genes, chromosomes & cancer",9007329,['EC 2.7.7.49 (Telomerase)'],IM,"['Anemia/genetics', 'Chromosomal Instability/*genetics', 'Chromosome Banding/methods', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 7', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Karyotyping', 'Metaphase/genetics', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*genetics', 'Reference Values', 'Telomerase/metabolism', 'Telomere/*genetics/ultrastructure']",2009/12/10 06:00,2010/02/25 06:00,['2009/12/10 06:00'],"['2009/12/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/12/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/02/25 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/gcc.20737 [doi]'],ppublish,Genes Chromosomes Cancer. 2010 Mar;49(3):260-9. doi: 10.1002/gcc.20737.,49,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) at diagnosis showed deletion of the second ETV6 signal from all fusion positive cells in 45% of the long-term survivors but in none of the relapsed patients, whereas patients with mixed populations with retained or lost second signals were more frequent among those who had relapsed (69%) than the long-term survivors (21%). Interphase populations with two fusion signals in 18% of the long-term survivors and 31% of relapsed patients were smaller in the long-term survivors (median, 4% of total cells) than in the relapsed patients (median, 84%). The additional copy of chromosome 21 in 30% of long-term survivors and in 69% of relapsed patients was a derived chromosome 21 in 20% and 55% of patients, respectively. Metaphase FISH for 26 long-term survivors and 15 relapsed patients revealed complex karyotypes in both groups.

Our aim was to establish whether this is a general phenomenon. We examined the effects of FTS on gene-expression profiles, growth and death of NCIH929 myeloma cells and K562 leukemia cells, which-like LAN-1 cells-exhibit Myc gene amplification and harbor active Ras. Under specified conditions, FTS reduced Ras and Myc and induced cell growth arrest and death in all Myc-amplified cell lines but not in SHEP, a neuroblastoma cell line without Myc gene amplification. Gene-expression analysis revealed a common pattern of FTS-induced endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, known as the unfolded protein response (UPR), in Myc-amplified cells, but not in SHEP. Thus, Ras negatively regulates ER stress in cells with amplified Myc. ER stress was also inducible by dominant-negative (DN)-Ras or shRNA to Ras isoforms, all of which induced an increase in BIP (the master regulator of ER stress) and its downstream targets Nrf2 and eIF2alpha, both regulated by active p-PERK. FTS also induced an increase in p-PERK, while small interfering RNA to PERK reduced Nrf2 and ATF4 and rescued cells from FTS-induced death. BIP and its downstream targets were also increased by inhibitors of MAPK p38 and MEK. Ras, acting through MAPK p38 and MEK, negatively regulates the ER stress cascades BIP/PERK/Nrf2 and eIF2alpha/ATF4/ATF3. These findings can explain the Ras-dependent protection of Myc-amplified cells from ER stress-associated death.","['Yaari-Stark, Shira', 'Shaked, Maayan', 'Nevo-Caspi, Yael', 'Jacob-Hircsh, Jasmine', 'Shamir, Ron', 'Rechavi, Gideon', 'Kloog, Yoel']","['Yaari-Stark S', 'Shaked M', 'Nevo-Caspi Y', 'Jacob-Hircsh J', 'Shamir R', 'Rechavi G', 'Kloog Y']","['Department of Neurobiology, The George S.

In 52 patients (35.6%) clinically relevant, partially neoplastic bone marrow changes (5 non-Hodgkin lymphoma, 9 myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS)/acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and 3 myeloproliferative neoplasias) were evident. Medication history showed intake of hydroxy-/chloroquine (13.5%), methotrexate (17.3%), cyclosporin (7.7%), sulfasalazine (7.7%), mycophenolatmofetil, gold, leflunomide (each 1.9%), azathioprine (aza, 25.0%) or cyclophosphamide (cyc, 7.7%) prior to bone marrow examination. 7 out of 9 patients, who developed MDS/AML had been treated with either azathioprine alone or additionally with cyclophosphamide (n = 3). CONCLUSION: One third of our patients showed relevant bone marrow changes that might be associated to therapy. The risk seems to be increased especially in patients with inflammatory rheumatic diseases who had received azathioprine alone or in combination with cyclophosphamide. Health care providers should bear in mind the risk of hematologic malignancies and monitor patients closely in this respect. Bone marrow examination should be performed in case of changes in peripheral blood counts; especially clinically relevant anemia, granulocytes < 2,500/microl, thrombocytes < 100,000/microl and relevant changes over time should lead to bone marrow examinations.","['Richter, Jutta G', 'Gossen, Pascal', 'Germing, Ulrich', 'Blum, Sabine', 'Hildebrandt, Barbara', 'Braunstein, Stefan', 'Huscher, Dorte', 'Schneider, Matthias']","['Richter JG', 'Gossen P', 'Germing U', 'Blum S', 'Hildebrandt B', 'Braunstein S', 'Huscher D', 'Schneider M']","['Klinik fur Endokrinologie, Diabetologie und Rheumatologie, Heinrich-Heine-Universitat Dusseldorf, Dusseldorf, Germany. richter@rheumanet.org']",['ger'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",,Austria,Wien Klin Wochenschr,Wiener klinische Wochenschrift,21620870R,['0 (Anti-Inflammatory Agents)'],IM,"['Anti-Inflammatory Agents/therapeutic use', 'Bone Marrow/*pathology', 'Bone Marrow Diseases/*epidemiology', 'Comorbidity', 'Female', 'Germany/epidemiology', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Rheumatic Diseases/drug therapy/*epidemiology/*pathology', 'Risk Assessment/methods', 'Risk Factors']",2009/12/10 06:00,2010/02/25 06:00,['2009/12/10 06:00'],"['2009/06/03 00:00 [received]', '2009/09/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/12/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/12/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/02/25 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00508-009-1264-x [doi]'],ppublish,Wien Klin Wochenschr. 2009;121(21-22):690-9. doi: 10.1007/s00508-009-1264-x.,121,,,,,,,,,,,,,Die Rationale fur Knochenmarkuntersuchungen bei Patienten mit entzundlich-rheumatischen Erkrankungen.,,,,,,,

With current treatment regimens, survival rates amongst these, and also those younger patients who relapse, remain dismal and novel therapies are urgently required. In particular, therapies that have anti-leukaemic activity but that, unlike conventional chemotherapy, do not impair normal haemopoiesis. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Here we demonstrate the potent anti-leukaemic activity of the combination of the lipid-regulating drug bezafibrate (BEZ) and the sex hormone medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) against AML cell lines and primary AML cells. The combined activity of BEZ and MPA (B/M) converged upon the increased synthesis and reduced metabolism of prostaglandin D(2) (PGD(2)) resulting in elevated levels of the downstream highly bioactive, anti-neoplastic prostaglandin 15-deoxy Delta(12,14) PGJ(2) (15d-PGJ(2)). BEZ increased PGD(2) synthesis via the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and activation of the lipid peroxidation pathway. MPA directed prostaglandin synthesis towards 15d-PGJ(2) by inhibiting the PGD(2) 11beta -ketoreductase activity of the aldo-keto reductase AKR1C3, which metabolises PGD(2) to 9alpha11beta-PGF(2alpha). B/M treatment resulted in growth arrest, apoptosis and cell differentiation in both AML cell lines and primary AML cells and these actions were recapitulated by treatment with 15d-PGJ(2). Importantly, the actions of B/M had little effect on the survival of normal adult myeloid progenitors. SIGNIFICANCE: Collectively our data demonstrate that B/M treatment of AML cells elevated ROS and delivered the anti-neoplastic actions of 15d-PGJ(2). These observations provide the mechanistic rationale for the redeployment of B/M in elderly and relapsed AML.","['Khanim, Farhat L', 'Hayden, Rachel E', 'Birtwistle, Jane', 'Lodi, Alessia', 'Tiziani, Stefano', 'Davies, Nicholas J', 'Ride, Jon P', 'Viant, Mark R', 'Gunther, Ulrich L', 'Mountford, Joanne C', 'Schrewe, Heinrich', 'Green, Richard M', 'Murray, Jim A', 'Drayson, Mark T', 'Bunce, Chris M']","['Khanim FL', 'Hayden RE', 'Birtwistle J', 'Lodi A', 'Tiziani S', 'Davies NJ', 'Ride JP', 'Viant MR', 'Gunther UL', 'Mountford JC', 'Schrewe H', 'Green RM', 'Murray JA', 'Drayson MT', 'Bunce CM']","['School of Biosciences, University of Birmingham, Birmingham, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20091207,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (15-deoxyprostaglandin J2)', '0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (I-kappa B Proteins)', '0 (PPAR gamma)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '11103-57-4 (Vitamin A)', '1C6V77QF41 (Cholecalciferol)', 'C2QI4IOI2G (Medroxyprogesterone Acetate)', 'EC 1.1.- (3-Hydroxysteroid Dehydrogenases)', 'EC 1.1.1.- (Hydroxyprostaglandin Dehydrogenases)', 'EC 1.1.1.357 (AKR1C3 protein, human)', 'EC 1.1.1.357 (Aldo-Keto Reductase Family 1 Member C3)', 'GAN16C9B8O (Glutathione)', 'RXY07S6CZ2 (Prostaglandin D2)', 'Y9449Q51XH (Bezafibrate)']",IM,"['3-Hydroxysteroid Dehydrogenases/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Aldo-Keto Reductase Family 1 Member C3', 'Antigens, CD34/metabolism', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Bezafibrate/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cholecalciferol/metabolism', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Glutathione/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Hydroxyprostaglandin Dehydrogenases/antagonists & inhibitors', 'I-kappa B Proteins/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Medroxyprogesterone Acetate/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'PPAR gamma/metabolism', 'Prostaglandin D2/analogs & derivatives/metabolism', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism', 'Vitamin A/metabolism']",2009/12/10 06:00,2010/03/18 06:00,['2009/12/10 06:00'],"['2009/06/25 00:00 [received]', '2009/11/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/12/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/12/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/03/18 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1371/journal.pone.0008147 [doi]'],epublish,PLoS One. 2009 Dec 7;4(12):e8147. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0008147.,4,,,PMC2785482,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Records of 390 patients with FN hospitalized over 2 years were reviewed. For the 332 who met inclusion criteria, one FN episode was randomly selected. Independent predictors at presentation were analyzed using multiple regression models. Optimal cut-off risk prediction scores were determined. These models were validated by bootstrap analysis. RESULTS: Patients' median age was 6.0 years; 66% had an underlying diagnosis of leukemia. Independent predictors of IBD (n = 56) were absolute neutrophil count <100, temperature at presentation > or =39.0 degrees C, ""sick"" clinical appearance, and underlying diagnosis of acute myeloid leukemia. A total weighted score <24 reliably identified patients at low risk for IBD. Independent predictors of CC (n = 47) were relapse of malignancy, non-white race, ""sick"" clinical appearance, and underlying diagnosis of acute myeloid leukemia. A total weighted score <19 predicted patients at low risk for CC. Of those misclassified as low risk, 11 of 12 with IBD and 3 of 9 with CC had the outcome within 24 hours of presentation. Of the remaining patients classified as low-risk for IBD and CC, 99.5% and 97.1%, respectively, remained outcome-free after 24 hours of observation. CONCLUSIONS: This study identifies predictors of infection/complications in pediatric patients with FN, establishes clinical cut-off scores and highlights the importance of the initial clinical impression and 24 hours of observation.

Alkylating agents and topoisomerase II inhibitors, fundamental to the treatment of breast cancer, are the most likely contributors to this increase in risk. Radiation therapy adds to the risk, and there is speculation that granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) may also predispose to leukemia. The purpose of this systemic review is to bring to the attention of family physicians the unintended consequence of leukemia secondary to aggressively treated breast cancer. METHODS: The medical records of several patients from Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital, with previously treated breast cancer admitted for therapy for AML or myelodysplasia, were reviewed. In addition, the recent literature on this topic was reviewed. RESULTS: Cases of patients whose AML was likely secondary to their treatment for breast cancer were used to illustrate the role of chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and perhaps G-CSF in the development of leukemia. CONCLUSIONS: Chemotherapy and radiation therapy administered for breast cancer predispose patients to the development of MDS or AML. We hypothesize that the breast cancer (BRCA) gene mutations might add to the risk and that primary care physicians must be aware of the long-term risks of cytotoxic therapy, including the development of MDS or AML.","['Cole, Marion', 'Strair, Roger']","['Cole M', 'Strair R']","['University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey, New Brunswick, New Jersey, USA. marionwomack@hotmail.com']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,Am J Med Sci,The American journal of the medical sciences,0370506,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating/adverse effects', 'Breast Neoplasms/*drug therapy/*radiotherapy', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/chemically induced/*etiology', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/chemically induced/*etiology']",2009/12/10 06:00,2010/02/05 06:00,['2009/12/10 06:00'],"['2009/12/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/12/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/02/05 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1097/MAJ.0b013e3181bedb74 [doi]', 'S0002-9629(15)31715-8 [pii]']",ppublish,Am J Med Sci. 2010 Jan;339(1):36-40. doi: 10.1097/MAJ.0b013e3181bedb74.,339,,,,,28,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Mechanistic studies have demonstrated that realgar is able to induce cell differentiation. METHODS: The oxidative stress in the realgar-induced differentiation was examined with human leukemia HL-60 cells. Cell differentiation was evaluated by the expression of cell surface antigen CD11b and nitroblue tetrazolium assay. The activities of catalase and superoxide dismutase were measured spectrophotometrically. Flow cytometry was used to assess cell cycle distribution and apoptosis, the cellular level of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and glutathione, as well as mitochondrial transmembrane potential (MTP). RESULTS: The realgar-induced differentiation was enhanced by hydrogen peroxide, and preceded with drastic changes in ROS and catalase, as well as small changes in superoxide dismutase and the reduced form of glutathione. MTP values at 24 h were in linear proportion to the CD11b expression at 48 h when no apoptosis was observed. CONCLUSION: Oxidative stress and stress-related MTP decrease are associated with realgar-induced differentiation in HL-60 cells.","['Wang, Li-Wen', 'Shi, Yan-Ling', 'Wang, Nan', 'Gou, Bao-Di', 'Zhang, Tian-Lan', 'Wang, Kui']","['Wang LW', 'Shi YL', 'Wang N', 'Gou BD', 'Zhang TL', 'Wang K']","['Department of Chemical Biology, Capital Medical University School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Beijing, PR China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20091209,Switzerland,Chemotherapy,Chemotherapy,0144731,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (CD11b Antigen)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '0 (Sulfides)', '56320-22-0 (arsenic disulfide)', 'GAN16C9B8O (Glutathione)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Arsenicals/*pharmacology', 'CD11b Antigen/genetics', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Differentiation/*drug effects', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Glutathione/metabolism', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/drug therapy/pathology', 'Membrane Potential, Mitochondrial/drug effects', 'Oxidative Stress/*drug effects', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism', 'Sulfides/*pharmacology', 'Time Factors']",2009/12/10 06:00,2010/03/20 06:00,['2009/12/10 06:00'],"['2009/04/28 00:00 [received]', '2009/08/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/12/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/12/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/03/20 06:00 [medline]']","['000265528 [pii]', '10.1159/000265528 [doi]']",ppublish,Chemotherapy. 2009;55(6):460-7. doi: 10.1159/000265528.

RESULTS: Survivors of cancer were significantly more likely than siblings to report congestive heart failure (hazard ratio (HR) 5.9, 95% confidence interval 3.4 to 9.6; P<0.001), myocardial infarction (HR 5.0, 95% CI 2.3 to 10.4; P<0.001), pericardial disease (HR 6.3, 95% CI 3.3 to 11.9; P<0.001), or valvular abnormalities (HR 4.8, 95% CI 3.0 to 7.6; P<0.001). Exposure to 250 mg/m(2) or more of anthracyclines increased the relative hazard of congestive heart failure, pericardial disease, and valvular abnormalities by two to five times compared with survivors who had not been exposed to anthracyclines. Cardiac radiation exposure of 1500 centigray or more increased the relative hazard of congestive heart failure, myocardial infarction, pericardial disease, and valvular abnormalities by twofold to sixfold compared to non-irradiated survivors. The cumulative incidence of adverse cardiac outcomes in cancer survivors continued to increase up to 30 years after diagnosis. CONCLUSION: Survivors of childhood and adolescent cancer are at substantial risk for cardiovascular disease. Healthcare professionals must be aware of these risks when caring for this growing population.","['Mulrooney, Daniel A', 'Yeazel, Mark W', 'Kawashima, Toana', 'Mertens, Ann C', 'Mitby, Pauline', 'Stovall, Marilyn', 'Donaldson, Sarah S', 'Green, Daniel M', 'Sklar, Charles A', 'Robison, Leslie L', 'Leisenring, Wendy M']","['Mulrooney DA', 'Yeazel MW', 'Kawashima T', 'Mertens AC', 'Mitby P', 'Stovall M', 'Donaldson SS', 'Green DM', 'Sklar CA', 'Robison LL', 'Leisenring WM']","['University of Minnesota Medical School and Masonic Cancer Center, Minneapolis, MN 55455, USA. mulro006@umn.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20091208,England,BMJ,BMJ (Clinical research ed.),8900488,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age of Onset', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Heart Diseases/*mortality', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms/*mortality', 'Prognosis', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survivors/*statistics & numerical data', 'United States', 'Young Adult']",2009/12/10 06:00,2009/12/16 06:00,['2009/12/10 06:00'],"['2009/12/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/12/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2009/12/16 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1136/bmj.b4606 [doi]'],epublish,BMJ. 2009 Dec 8;339:b4606. doi: 10.1136/bmj.b4606.,339,"['1K12RR023247/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', 'U24 CA055727-17/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'K12 RR023247-05/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', 'K12 RR023247/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', 'U24 CA 55727/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U24 CA055727/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",['BMJ. 2009;339:b4691.

The early B-cell factors (EBF) are a family of four highly conserved DNA-binding transcription factors with an atypical zinc-finger and helix-loop-helix motif. They are involved in the differentiation and maturation of several cell lineages including B-progenitor lymphoblasts, neuronal precursors, and osteoblast progenitors. During B-cell development, EBF1 is required for the expression of Pax5, an essential factor for the production of antibody-secreting cells. Accumulating evidence indicates that genomic deletion of the EBF1 gene contributes to the pathogenesis, drug resistance, and relapse of B-progenitor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Epigenetic silencing and genomic deletion of the EBF3 locus in chromosome 10q are very frequent in glioblastoma (GBM). Strikingly, the frequency of EBF3 loss in GBM is similar to that of the loss of Pten, a key suppressor of gliomagenesis. Cancer-specific somatic mutations were detected in EBF3 in GBM and in both EBF1 and EBF3 in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma. These missense mutations occur in the DNA-binding domain or the conserved IPT/TIG domain, suggesting that they might disrupt the functions of these two proteins. Functional studies revealed that EBF3 represses the expression of genes required for cell proliferation [e.g., cyclins and cyclin-dependent kinases (CDK)] and survival (e.g., Mcl-1 and Daxx) but activates those involved in cell cycle arrest (e.g., p21 and p27), leading to growth suppression and apoptosis. Therefore, EBFs represent new tumor suppressors whose inactivation blocks normal development and contributes to tumorigenesis of diverse types of human cancer.","['Liao, Daiqing']",['Liao D'],"['Department of Anatomy and Cell Biology, UF Shands Cancer Center, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL 32611-3633, USA. dliao@ufl.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20091208,United States,Mol Cancer Res,Molecular cancer research : MCR,101150042,"['0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Growth and Development', 'Humans', 'Neoplasms/metabolism', 'Protein Binding', 'Transcription Factors/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/chemistry/*metabolism']",2009/12/10 06:00,2010/02/20 06:00,['2009/12/10 06:00'],"['2009/12/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/12/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/02/20 06:00 [medline]']","['1541-7786.MCR-09-0229 [pii]', '10.1158/1541-7786.MCR-09-0229 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Cancer Res. 2009 Dec;7(12):1893-901. doi: 10.1158/1541-7786.MCR-09-0229.

The major challenge in targeting leukemic stem cells (LSC) is finding therapies that largely spare normal hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) while eradicating quiescent LSCs. We present a mathematical model to predict how selective a therapy must be to ensure that enough HSCs survive when LSCs have been eradicated. Stem cell population size is modeled as a birth-death process. This permits comparison of LSC and HSC eradication times under therapy and calculation of the number of HSCs at the time of LSC eradication for varied initial population sizes and stem cell death rates. We further investigate the effects of LSC quiescence and resistance mutations on our predictions. From a clinical point of view, our models suggest criteria by which cancer stem cell therapy safety can be assessed. We anticipate that in conjunction with experimental observation of cancer stem cell killing rates, our results will be useful in screening targeted therapies for both hematologic and solid tumor malignancies.","['Sehl, Mary E', 'Sinsheimer, Janet S', 'Zhou, Hua', 'Lange, Kenneth L']","['Sehl ME', 'Sinsheimer JS', 'Zhou H', 'Lange KL']","['Division of Hematology-Oncology, Department of Medicine, University of California, Los Angeles, California 90095-7059, USA. msehl@mednet.ucla.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,,IM,"['Algorithms', 'Computer Simulation', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*cytology', 'Leukemia/*pathology/*therapy', '*Models, Biological', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*pathology', 'Stochastic Processes']",2009/12/10 06:00,2010/01/06 06:00,['2009/12/10 06:00'],"['2009/12/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/12/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/01/06 06:00 [medline]']","['0008-5472.CAN-09-2070 [pii]', '10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-09-2070 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 2009 Dec 15;69(24):9481-9. doi: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-09-2070.,69,"['R01 GM053275-08/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 GM053275-07/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'GM53275/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 GM053275-09/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 MH059490/MH/NIMH NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 GM053275/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'MH59490/MH/NIMH NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 GM008185/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'GM008185/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R37 MH059490/MH/NIMH NIH HHS/United States']",,PMC2844253,['NIHMS154608'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the role of JNK activity in the oncogenic growth of T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) cells remains largely unknown. Here, we report that treatment of T-ALL cells with JNK inhibitors led to cell cycle arrest and apoptosis and increased sensitivity to Fas-mediated apoptosis, whereas weak ectopic expression of MKK7-JNK1 fusion protein, which shows constitutive JNK activity, in T-ALL cells resulted in accelerated cell cycle progression and resistance to Fas-mediated apoptosis. The protein levels of c-Myc and Bcl-2 were reduced in the presence of JNK inhibitors but were enhanced with MKK7-JNK1. Small interfering RNA against JNK1, but not JNK2, exhibited similar effects to JNK inhibitors. These findings suggest that targeting JNK, especially JNK1 isoform, may have some important therapeutic implications in the treatment of T-ALL. Further exploration revealed that JNK protein and basal JNK activity in T-ALL cells showed aberrant subcellular localization, but no hyperactivation of JNK was observed. Thus, our work suggests that there might be novel mechanism(s) other than hyperactivation underlying the protumorigenic role of JNK activity.","['Cui, Jian', 'Wang, Qingyang', 'Wang, Jing', 'Lv, Ming', 'Zhu, Ning', 'Li, Yan', 'Feng, Jiannan', 'Shen, Beifen', 'Zhang, Jiyan']","['Cui J', 'Wang Q', 'Wang J', 'Lv M', 'Zhu N', 'Li Y', 'Feng J', 'Shen B', 'Zhang J']","[""Department of Molecular Immunology, Institute of Basic Medical Sciences, 27 Taiping Road, Beijing 100850, People's Republic of China.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Mol Cancer Ther,Molecular cancer therapeutics,101132535,"['0', '(1,3-benzothiazol-2-yl(2-((2-(3-pyridinyl)ethyl)amino)-4-pyrimidinyl)acetonitrile', ')', '0 (Acetonitriles)', '0 (Anthracenes)', '0 (Benzothiazoles)', '0 (MYC protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc)', '1TW30Y2766 (pyrazolanthrone)', 'EC 2.7.1.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 9)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 8)', 'EC 2.7.12.2 (MAP Kinase Kinase 7)', 'EC 2.7.12.2 (MAP2K7 protein, human)']",IM,"['Acetonitriles/pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Anthracenes/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Benzothiazoles/pharmacology', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', '*Cell Proliferation', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Immunoblotting', 'JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Jurkat Cells', 'MAP Kinase Kinase 7/genetics/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 8/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 9/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc/metabolism', 'RNA Interference', 'Transfection']",2009/12/10 06:00,2010/03/25 06:00,['2009/12/10 06:00'],"['2009/12/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/12/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/03/25 06:00 [medline]']","['1535-7163.MCT-09-0408 [pii]', '10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-09-0408 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Cancer Ther. 2009 Dec;8(12):3214-22. doi: 10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-09-0408.,8,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: RNA was extracted from archived tumor samples derived from 378 patients with stage I to III HR-positive, HER2-normal breast cancer and analyzed by reverse transcription-PCR for a panel of 374 genes, including the 21-gene recurrence score (RS). Patients were randomized to receive adjuvant doxorubicin plus cyclophosphamide or docetaxel in trial E2197, with no difference in recurrence seen in the treatment arms. All available recurrent cases were selected plus a nonrecurrent cohort. Cox proportional hazard models were used to identify relationships between gene expression and recurrence. RESULTS: TOP2A expression exhibited the strongest association with increased recurrence risk (P = 0.01), and was significantly associated with recurrence (P = 0.008) in a multivariate analysis adjusted for clinicopathologic features. Elevated TOP2A expression above the median was associated with a 2.6-fold increase (95% confidence interval, 1.3-5.2; P = 0.008) in risk of recurrence if the RS was <18, and a 2.0-fold increase (95% confidence interval, 1.2-3.2, P = 0.003) if there was an intermediate RS of 18 to 30. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with HR-positive, HER2-normal breast cancer, a population known to have a low incidence of TOP2A gene alterations thought to be predictive of anthracycline benefit, there is a range of TOP2A RNA expression that is strongly associated with recurrence after adjuvant anthracyclines, which provides information complementary to RS, indicating that it merits further evaluation as a prognostic and predictive marker.

The GO data indicated that 16 proteins were closely associated with apoptotic mechanisms. As(2)O(3)-induced DNA damage and oxidative stress that accompanied apoptosis in SK-Hep-1 cells were observed using comet assay and 5-and-6-chloromethyl-2',7'-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate fluorescence microscopy, respectively. CONCLUSION: The anticancer activities of As(2)O(3) may be mediated by DNA damage- and reactive oxygen species-induced apoptotic mechanisms which involve the proteins identified in this study.","['Yoo, Dong Ryeol', 'Chong, Seon Ah', 'Nam, Myeong Jin']","['Yoo DR', 'Chong SA', 'Nam MJ']","['Gachon University of Medicine and Science, 534-2 Yeonsu-dong, Yeonsu-gu, Incheon, Republic of Korea.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Greece,Cancer Genomics Proteomics,Cancer genomics & proteomics,101188791,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (Oxides)', '0 (Proteome)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals/*pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'DNA Damage', 'Humans', 'Liver Neoplasms/*chemistry/*drug therapy/genetics/metabolism', 'Oxidative Stress/drug effects', 'Oxides/*pharmacology', 'Proteome/*analysis', 'Proteomics', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism']",2009/12/10 06:00,2010/02/18 06:00,['2009/12/10 06:00'],"['2009/12/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/12/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/02/18 06:00 [medline]']",['6/5/269 [pii]'],ppublish,Cancer Genomics Proteomics. 2009 Sep-Oct;6(5):269-74.,6,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We investigated these aspects in a large series of patients. DESIGN AND METHODS: Chromosome 13 deletion (Delta13), deletion of TP53, ploidy status and immunoglobulin heavy chain (IgH) translocations were evaluated by fluorescence in situ hybridization in patients with monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (n=189), smoldering multiple myeloma (n=127) and multiple myeloma (n=400). RESULTS: Overall, Delta13 (25%, 34% and 47%), 16q23 deletions (6%, 8% and 21%) and 17p13 deletions (3%, 1% and 10%) were less frequent in patients with monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance and smoldering multiple myeloma than in those with multiple myeloma. When distinct genetic groups were considered, no differences in the prevalence of Delta13 were found with t(4;14)(p16;q32) and t(14;16)(q32;q23) among the three diagnostic groups; in contrast Delta13 was rarer in t(11;14)(q13;q32) in patients with monoclonal gammopathy (1/28) and smoldering myeloma (2/13) than in those with multiple myeloma (40%). Similar results were seen for the few t(6;14)(p21;q32) cases: 0/3 patients with monoclonal gammopathy or smoldering myeloma had the Delta13, whereas 4/6 (67%) patients with multiple myeloma and this translocation also had the deletion. In multiple myeloma patients with both an IgH translocation and Delta13, the proportions of cells affected by the two abnormalities were similar, as was the case for t(4;14) and t(14;16) monoclonal gammopathy patients positive for Delta13. In contrast, in monoclonal gammopathy patients with t(14;20)(q32;q11), the translocation was present in almost all cells, while the Delta13 was present in only a sub-population. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that the presence and time of occurrence of Delta13 depends on the presence of specific concurrent abnormalities. The observation that Delta13 was extremely rare in monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance and smoldering multiple myeloma with translocations directly involving cyclin D genes (CCND1 and CCND3) suggest a possible role of Delta13 in the progression of the disease specifically in these genetic sub-groups.

The cellular origin of leukemic fusion genes during human development is difficult to ascertain. The bone marrow (BM) microenvironment plays an important role in the pathogenesis of several hematological malignances. BM mesenchymal stem cells (BM-MSC) from 38 children diagnosed with cytogenetically different acute leukemias were screened for leukemic fusion genes. Fusion genes were absent in BM-MSCs of childhood leukemias carrying TEL-AML1, BCR-ABL, AML1-ETO, MLL-AF9, MLL-AF10, MLL-ENL or hyperdiploidy. However, MLL-AF4 was detected and expressed in BM-MSCs from all cases of MLL-AF4(+) B-ALL. Unlike leukemic blasts, MLL-AF4(+) BM-MSCs did not display monoclonal Ig gene rearrangements. Endogenous or ectopic expression of MLL-AF4 exerted no effect on MSC culture homeostasis. These findings suggest that MSCs may be in part tumor-related, highlighting an unrecognized role of the BM milieu on the pathogenesis of MLL-AF4(+) B-ALL. MLL-AF4 itself is not sufficient for MSC transformation and the expression of MLL-AF4 in MSCs is compatible with a mesenchymal phenotype, suggesting a differential impact in the hematopoietic system and mesenchyme. The absence of monoclonal rearrangements in MLL-AF4(+) BM-MSCs precludes the possibility of cellular plasticity or de-differentiation of B-ALL blasts and suggests that MLL-AF4 might arise in a population of prehematopoietic precursors.","['Menendez, Pablo', 'Catalina, Purificacion', 'Rodriguez, Rene', 'Melen, Gustavo J', 'Bueno, Clara', 'Arriero, Mar', 'Garcia-Sanchez, Felix', 'Lassaletta, Alvaro', 'Garcia-Sanz, Ramon', 'Garcia-Castro, Javier']","['Menendez P', 'Catalina P', 'Rodriguez R', 'Melen GJ', 'Bueno C', 'Arriero M', 'Garcia-Sanchez F', 'Lassaletta A', 'Garcia-Sanz R', 'Garcia-Castro J']","['Andalusian Stem Cell Bank, Centro de Investigacion Biomedica, Consejeria de Salud-Universidad de Granada, 18100 Granada, Spain. pablo.menendez@juntadeandalucia.es']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20091207,United States,J Exp Med,The Journal of experimental medicine,2985109R,"['0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (MLL-AF4 fusion protein, human)', '0 (MLL-AF9 fusion protein, human)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (TEL-AML1 fusion protein)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)']",IM,"['Cells, Cultured', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit/analysis', 'Gene Rearrangement', 'Homeostasis', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Mesenchymal Stem Cells/*metabolism', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/analysis/*genetics', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/analysis/*genetics', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics']",2009/12/10 06:00,2010/01/08 06:00,['2009/12/10 06:00'],"['2009/12/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/12/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/01/08 06:00 [medline]']","['jem.20091050 [pii]', '10.1084/jem.20091050 [doi]']",ppublish,J Exp Med. 2009 Dec 21;206(13):3131-41. doi: 10.1084/jem.20091050.

We conducted an investigator-initiated phase II study with GO to assess its efficacy and safety, administering two dosages of 7.5 mg/m(2) with a 14 d-interval. Thirty children who were refractory to re-induction at first relapse or suffered from second relapse of AML received a total of 64 infusions of GO.

Nine patients were subsequently transplanted (median time to transplant, 4 weeks, range 3-21 weeks), and three of these patients are currently in continuous CR with a median follow-up of >3 years, and can considered to be cured. This resulted in a statistically significant survival advantage for children who responded to GO versus those who did not [27% (standard error 13%) vs. 0%, respectively, P = 0.001]. All other children died, mainly from progressive disease. The treatment was generally well tolerated by most patients. The frequency of transient transaminatis was low.

The mechanisms regulating NOTCH2-dependent CD23 expression, however, are largely unknown. This study showed that peripheral CLL cells overexpressed transcriptionally active NOTCH2 (N2(IC)), irrespective of their prognostic marker profile. When placed in culture, NOTCH2 activity was spontaneously decreased in 25 out of 31 CLL cases (81%) within 24 h. DNA-bound N2(IC) complexes could be maintained by the protein kinase C (PKC) activator phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) or by gamma-interferon (IFN-gamma), two CLL characteristic inducers of CD23 expression. Inhibition of PKC-delta by RNA interference or by rottlerin antagonised PMA-induced NOTCH2 activation and also suppressed NOTCH2 activity in CLL cases with constitutively activated NOTCH2 signalling. In 23 out of 29 CLL cases tested (79%), DNA-bound N2(IC) complexes were found to be resistant to the gamma-secretase inhibitor (GSI) DAPT, suggesting that GSIs will be only effective in a subset of CLL cases. These data suggest that deregulation of NOTCH2 signalling is critically involved in maintaining the malignant phenotype of CLL lymphocytes and point to a link between PKC-delta and NOTCH2 signalling in the leukemic cells.","['Hubmann, Rainer', 'Duchler, Markus', 'Schnabl, Susanne', 'Hilgarth, Martin', 'Demirtas, Dita', 'Mitteregger, Dieter', 'Holbl, Andrea', 'Vanura, Katrina', 'Le, Trang', 'Look, Thomas', 'Schwarzmeier, Josef D', 'Valent, Peter', 'Jager, Ulrich', 'Shehata, Medhat']","['Hubmann R', 'Duchler M', 'Schnabl S', 'Hilgarth M', 'Demirtas D', 'Mitteregger D', 'Holbl A', 'Vanura K', 'Le T', 'Look T', 'Schwarzmeier JD', 'Valent P', 'Jager U', 'Shehata M']","['Clinic of Internal Medicine I, Department of Haematology and Haemostaseology, Medical University of Vienna, Waehringer Guertel 18-20, Vienna, Austria.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20091208,England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (NOTCH2 protein, human)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Receptor, Notch2)', '0 (Receptors, IgE)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C-delta)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Antigens, Neoplasm/metabolism', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Interferon-gamma/immunology', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/genetics/*immunology', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*metabolism', 'Prognosis', 'Protein Kinase C-delta/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'RNA Interference', 'Receptor, Notch2/genetics/*metabolism', 'Receptors, IgE/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/immunology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2009/12/10 06:00,2010/10/16 06:00,['2009/12/10 06:00'],"['2009/12/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/12/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/10/16 06:00 [medline]']","['BJH8024 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1365-2141.2009.08024.x [doi]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2010 Mar;148(6):868-78. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.2009.08024.x.

We conducted a population-based study including 6439 AML patients aged 19-80 years in Sweden between 1973 and 2001. Mixture cure models were estimated, with age at diagnosis categorised (19-40, 41-60, 61-70 and 71-80) and year of diagnosis modelled using splines. In 1975 the cure proportion was < or =6% in all age groups and the median survival time for 'uncured' patients was <0.5 years. In 2000 the cure proportion was 68% (95% confidence interval 56-77%) in the youngest group, and 32% (25-39%), 8% (3-21%), and 4% (2-8%) in the other groups, respectively.

Within an ongoing prospective phase II trial, 22 patients with advanced myeloid malignancies and a median age of 65 years (range 54-76) received anti-CD66 Rhenium radioimmunotherapy followed by fludarabine (150 mg/m(2)), busulfan (8 mg/kg) and alemtuzumab (75 mg) before allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplantation from matched sibling (n = 7) and unrelated donors (n = 15). The extramedullary toxicity in the first 100 d post-transplantation was limited and all patients engrafted with complete donor chimaerism. The incidence of non-relapse mortality at day 100 and after 2 years was 4.5% and 23%, respectively. The probability of overall survival at 2 years was 40%. A comparison with a younger historical cohort (median age 57 years) having received the same dose of fludarabine and busulfan but neither radioimmunotherapy nor alemtuzumab showed no difference in outcome. Although the use of alemtuzumab reduced the incidence of acute graft-versus-host-disease, it was associated with a relapse incidence of 40% despite the incorporation of radioimmmunotherapy. In summary, we confirmed the feasibility of combined radioimmunotherapy and reduced-intensity conditioning in elderly patients. Further optimisation, probably involving less T cell depletion, is necessary before a randomized comparison with standard conditioning can be planned.","['Lauter, Anett', 'Strumpf, Annette', 'Platzbecker, Uwe', 'Schetelig, Johannes', 'Wermke, Martin', 'Radke, Jorgen', 'Kiani, Alexander', 'Wunderlich, Gerd', 'Thiede, Christian', 'Ehninger, Gerhard', 'Kotzerke, Jorg', 'Bornhauser, Martin']","['Lauter A', 'Strumpf A', 'Platzbecker U', 'Schetelig J', 'Wermke M', 'Radke J', 'Kiani A', 'Wunderlich G', 'Thiede C', 'Ehninger G', 'Kotzerke J', 'Bornhauser M']","['Medizinische Klinik und Poliklinik I, University Hospital Carl Gustav Carus, Fetscherstrasse 74, Dresden, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial, Phase II', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20091207,England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (CD66 antigens)', '0 (Cell Adhesion Molecules)', '0 (Radioisotopes)', '7440-15-5 (Rhenium)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antigens, CD/immunology', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/immunology', 'Cell Adhesion Molecules/immunology', 'Epidemiologic Methods', 'Erythrocyte Transfusion', 'Female', 'Graft Survival', 'Graft vs Host Disease/etiology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*methods', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*radiotherapy', 'Lymphocyte Depletion/methods', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Platelet Transfusion', 'Radioimmunotherapy/adverse effects/*methods', 'Radioisotopes/therapeutic use', 'Recurrence', 'Rhenium/*therapeutic use', 'Transplantation Conditioning/*methods']",2009/12/10 06:00,2010/10/16 06:00,['2009/12/10 06:00'],"['2009/12/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/12/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/10/16 06:00 [medline]']","['BJH8025 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1365-2141.2009.08025.x [doi]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2010 Mar;148(6):910-7. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.2009.08025.x.

The MTT assay revealed that only TOF (total oligomer flavonoids), ethyl acetate (EA), chloroform (Chl), and petroleum ether (PE) extracts inhibited the proliferation of K562 cells. Apoptosis plays a very important role in the treatment of cancer by promoting the apoptosis of cancer cells and limiting the concurrent death of normal cells. Thus, the possible effects of M. arvensis extracts on the induction of apoptosis in human leukemic cells (K562 cells) were investigated. The electrophoretic analysis of DNA fragmentation confirms that TOF, Chl, PE, and EA extracts provoke DNA fragmentation. Using the lipid peroxidation inhibitory assay, the antioxidant capacity of M. arvensis extracts was evaluated by the ability of each extract to inhibit malondialdehyde formation. It was revealed that EA and TOF extracts are the most active in scavenging the hydroxyl radicals.","['Skandrani, Ines', 'Boubaker, Jihed', 'Bhouri, Wissem', 'Limem, Ilef', 'Kilani, Soumaya', 'Ben Sghaier, Mohamed', 'Neffati, Aicha', 'Bouhlel, Ines', 'Ghedira, Kamel', 'Chekir-Ghedira, Leila']","['Skandrani I', 'Boubaker J', 'Bhouri W', 'Limem I', 'Kilani S', 'Ben Sghaier M', 'Neffati A', 'Bouhlel I', 'Ghedira K', 'Chekir-Ghedira L']","['Unite de Pharmacognosie/Biologie Moleculaire 99/UR/07-03, Faculty of Pharmacy, Monastir, Tunisia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Drug Chem Toxicol,Drug and chemical toxicology,7801723,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Antioxidants)', '0 (Plant Extracts)', '0 (Solvents)', '4Y8F71G49Q (Malondialdehyde)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/isolation & purification/*pharmacology', 'Antioxidants/metabolism', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Brassicaceae/*chemistry', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'DNA Fragmentation/drug effects', 'Electrophoresis, Agar Gel', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Lipid Peroxidation/drug effects', 'Malondialdehyde/metabolism', 'Plant Extracts/*pharmacology', 'Plant Leaves', 'Solvents/chemistry']",2009/12/10 06:00,2011/01/13 06:00,['2009/12/10 06:00'],"['2009/12/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/12/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/01/13 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3109/01480540903376215 [doi]'],ppublish,Drug Chem Toxicol. 2010 Jan;33(1):20-7. doi: 10.3109/01480540903376215.,33,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we found FLT3-ITD mutations in 19.1%, FLT3-Asp835 mutations in 4.7%, and dual mutations in 4.2%, accounting for overall mutation in 28% of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients. FLT3 mutation was more prevalent in APL than non-APL patients (32.2% vs 26.3%), adults tend to show higher incidence than children (30.6% vs 18.2%, p = .1), and were significantly associated with normal karyotype, high WBCs, with no specific distribution in FAB subtypes. Notably, FLT3 mutation was present in 50% of patients with NPM1-Mt, when compared to only 22.6% of patients with NPM1-wt (p < .001). Sequence analyses of internal tandem duplications (ITDs) revealed that duplications were mostly restricted to JM domain (3 to 165 nucleotides). Interestingly, 92.3% cases showed duplication of at least one amino acid (AA) within the stretch Y589 to K602 that includes the two SH2-binding motifs. Analysis of frequency of single AA in the duplicated region revealed that E598 was the most frequently duplicated single AA in 72%, followed by R595 (69.2%), and Y599 (66.7%).

Separation from the frankly leukaemic cases is made only on the grounds of clinico-haematological convenience.Twenty-two cases have been seen in the past four years. The age-incidence varied from 3-73 years; 10 were in males and 12 in females. Acute, subacute, and chronic types may be recognized. In all the main characteristic is a progressive anaemia; in acute cases haemorrhagic phenomena and necrotic angina are common.The blood-count is characterized by orthochromic or hyperchromic anaemia, sometimes with reticulocytosis and erythroblastosis. Leukopenia may persist throughout the course, or a terminal leukaemia may occur-especially in the chronic cases. The features of the differential count are the presence of myeloblasts-although the percentage may be below 5%-and the hiatus leukaemicus. Thrombocytopenia usually means a rapid course.This clinico-haematological picture may be mimicked more or less closely by pernicious anaemia, aplastic anaemia, agranulocytosis, and the leuko-erythroblastic anaemias. The sternal puncture findings are, however, diagnostic, and show a great preponderance of primitive myeloid cells, most frequently with a predomincnce of myeloblasts. In two cases evidence was found that the erythropoietic tissues shared in the hyperplasia.","['Scott, R B']",['Scott RB'],,['eng'],['Journal Article'],,England,Proc R Soc Med,Proceedings of the Royal Society of Medicine,7505890,,,,1939/09/01 00:00,1939/09/01 00:01,['2009/12/09 06:00'],"['2009/12/09 06:00 [entrez]', '1939/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1939/09/01 00:01 [medline]']",,ppublish,Proc R Soc Med. 1939 Sep;32(11):1429-34.,32,,,PMC1998069,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A precise account of the ""nerve-cycle"" and of its exact relation to the sympathic and parasympathic-in a word, to the autonomous vegetative-system and to the endocrine system, is at present impossible. We have known since the time of the classic investigations of Flourens, Breuer, Mach, Crum Brown, and their followers-especially Sherrington-that the nature of these things is highly complicated. Simple mechanical theories are useless, even for teaching purposes, as they are more or less fictitious and often incomplete.The path of nervous action is through the ear, cerebellum, brain stem, cerebrum, medulla oblongata, spinal cord, and autonomous nervous system, to the different parts of the periphery, and there are also mutual connexions with the endocrine glands. Mention is made of the influence of constitution (i.e., inheritance, ""the natural endowment""), and also of the conditional disposition, temper, training, in a word all external and internal stimuli. Again, the various reflexes, the numerous aggregations of ganglia, indicating a certain autonomy of function, constitute a great problem for future clinical observation. The mechanism of adaptation and compensation by which extensive injury may sometimes be counterbalanced, also enters into the question, as do the varying collateral paths, the synergetic action of different and sometimes very distant organs and so forth. Again, we have to think of the ratio of irritability and fatiguability, a significant factor in causation. Syphilis, arthritis, alcoholism, nicotine-poisoning, anaemia, leukaemia, tumours, and-especially-catarrh, are most important causes.","['Muller, I']",['Muller I'],,['eng'],['Journal Article'],,England,Proc R Soc Med,Proceedings of the Royal Society of Medicine,7505890,,,,1928/06/01 00:00,1928/06/01 00:01,['2009/12/09 06:00'],"['2009/12/09 06:00 [entrez]', '1928/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1928/06/01 00:01 [medline]']",,ppublish,Proc R Soc Med. 1928 Jun;21(8):1369-76.,21,,,PMC2102565,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The prognostic value that lung resistance protein (LRP) and multidrug resistance-related protein 1 (MRP1) have in the setting of pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is controversial. The aim of this study was to investigate the expression of LRP and MRP1 and effect on clinical outcome and prognosis. The mRNA expression of LRP and MRP1 were analyzed in leukemic blasts of 34 pediatric ALL patients. LRP and MRP1 mRNA expression were detected in 41.2% and 35.3%, respectively. Eleven (91.7%) of 12 patients without LRP achieved CR compared with 9 (50.0%) of 18 with LRP expression. Similarly, 11 (100%) of 11 patients without MRP1 expression achieved CR compared with 9 (47.4%) of 19 with MRP1 expression and higher LRP expression rate or MRP1 expression rate was present in patients with relapse than MDR genes negative patients. The expression of either of two genes was associated with poorer 2-year survival. Also, patients expressing both genes had poorer outcomes and had worse 2-year survival. We suggest that MDR expression affects complete remission and survival rates in ALL patients. Thus, diagnosis appears to provide prognostic information for pediatric ALL.","['El-Sharnouby, Jehan A', 'Abou El-Enein, Amani M', 'El Ghannam, Doaa M', 'El-Shanshory, Mohamed R', 'Hagag, Adel A', 'Yahia, Soheir', 'Elashry, Rasha']","['El-Sharnouby JA', 'Abou El-Enein AM', 'El Ghannam DM', 'El-Shanshory MR', 'Hagag AA', 'Yahia S', 'Elashry R']","['Clinical Pathology Department, Faculty of Medicine, Tanta University, Egypt.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20091207,England,J Oncol Pharm Pract,Journal of oncology pharmacy practice : official publication of the International Society of Oncology Pharmacy Practitioners,9511372,"['0 (Multidrug Resistance-Associated Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Vault Ribonucleoprotein Particles)', '0 (major vault protein)', 'Y49M64GZ4Q (multidrug resistance-associated protein 1)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Multidrug Resistance-Associated Proteins/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/diagnosis/*metabolism/mortality', 'Prognosis', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis', 'Survival Rate', 'Vault Ribonucleoprotein Particles/*biosynthesis/genetics']",2009/12/09 06:00,2010/12/14 06:00,['2009/12/09 06:00'],"['2009/12/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/12/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/12/14 06:00 [medline]']","['1078155209351329 [pii]', '10.1177/1078155209351329 [doi]']",ppublish,J Oncol Pharm Pract. 2010 Sep;16(3):179-88. doi: 10.1177/1078155209351329.

Up to now, CD34(+) cells in MDS and AA patients have been studied extensively; however, little information is available on myeloid granulocytes. The aim of this study was to determine whether immunophenotype of myeloid granulocytes in AA patients was different from that of MDS. Flow cytometry was used to assess the immunophenotype of myeloid granulocytes in 22 patients with MDS, 12 with AA, and 10 normal subjects. Our data showed that the percentages of CD13(+) granulocytes, CD33(+) granulocytes, CD34(+) granulocytes, and HLA-DR(+) granulocytes were significantly higher in patients with MDS than in AA patients and normal subjects (P < 0.05). The percentages of CD15(+) granulocytes and CD10(+) granulocytes were significantly lower in patients with MDS than in AA patients and normal subjects (P < 0.05). There were no significant differences in the expression of these markers between patients with AA and normal subjects (P > 0.05). As refractory anemia progressing to refractory anemia with excess blasts, the percentages of CD13(+) granulocytes, CD33(+) granulocytes, CD34(+) granulocytes and HLA-DR(+) granulocytes were significantly increased, whereas, the percentage of CD15(+) granulocytes was significantly decreased (P < 0.05). These data suggest that immunophenotype of myeloid granulocytes may be a useful parameter for the differential diagnosis of MDS and AA.","['Huang, M', 'Li, J', 'Zhao, G', 'Sui, X', 'Zhao, X', 'Xu, H']","['Huang M', 'Li J', 'Zhao G', 'Sui X', 'Zhao X', 'Xu H']","['Department of Clinical Laboratory, Provincial Hospital Affiliated to Shandong University, Jinan City, China. huangmin1983@yahoo.com.cn']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20091130,England,Int J Lab Hematol,International journal of laboratory hematology,101300213,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, Myelomonocytic)', '0 (Antigens, Surface)', '0 (CD33 protein, human)', '0 (HLA-DR Antigens)', '0 (Lewis X Antigen)', '0 (Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 3)', 'EC 3.4.11.2 (CD13 Antigens)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Anemia, Aplastic/*diagnosis/immunology', 'Antigens, CD/metabolism', 'Antigens, CD34/metabolism', 'Antigens, Differentiation, Myelomonocytic/metabolism', 'Antigens, Surface/metabolism', 'CD13 Antigens/metabolism', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Granulocytes/*immunology', 'HLA-DR Antigens/metabolism', 'Humans', '*Immunophenotyping', 'Lewis X Antigen/metabolism', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*diagnosis/immunology', 'Reference Standards', 'Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 3']",2009/12/09 06:00,2010/09/24 06:00,['2009/12/09 06:00'],"['2009/12/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/12/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/09/24 06:00 [medline]']","['CLH1192 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1751-553X.2009.01192.x [doi]']",ppublish,Int J Lab Hematol. 2010 Jun;32(3):275-81. doi: 10.1111/j.1751-553X.2009.01192.x.

This study shows that BCR-ABL1 RQ-PCR monitoring of CML patients after ASCT with PB is concordant with BM in 95.3% of cases, and thus may be used to monitor the disease.

Although high expression of p-glycoprotein has been reported, other molecular mechanism of the chemo-resistance is largely unknown. Activation of STAT3 and expression of major apoptosis-related proteins Bcl-2, Bcl-x, and Mcl-1 were analyzed by immunohistochemistry. Effects of STAT3 inhibitor AG490 on NK-YS cell line were analyzed by Western blotting and flow cytometric apoptosis assay. STAT3 was activated in six of the nine nasal NK-cell lymphomas (67%). In contrast, STAT3 activation was detected in 35% of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and in 10% of follicular lymphoma (FL). Frequent activation of STAT3 was significantly correlated with Mcl-1 expression in nasal NK-cell lymphoma, i.e., Mcl-1 was positive in five of six STAT3-active cases and negative in all three STAT3-inactive ones. In DLBCL, not only six out of seven STAT3-active cases (86%) but also eight out of thirteen STAT3-inactive cases (62%) were positive for Mcl-1 expression. Latent membrane protein-1 was positive in four nasal NK-cell lymphomas, among which three cases showed intermediate STAT3 activation. Inhibition of STAT3 activation by JAK inhibitor AG490 decreased Mcl-1 expression and induced apoptosis in STAT3-active NK-YS cells. Serum starvation rather increased the Mcl-1 level in NK-YS cells, and this effect was also canceled by AG490. These results suggest that activation of STAT3-Mcl-1 axis may play a role in the chemotherapy resistance of nasal NK-cell lymphoma.

Broad expression and fast internalization makes CD74 an ideal target for cancer therapy. We reviewed published articles about CD74 and milatuzumab. We present a comprehensive review of CD74 functions and provide explanation of milatuzumab antitumor effects. This review describes CD74 protein biology with the emphasis on the role of CD74 in tumor survival and its new role in regulation of the Fas death receptor. The development of CD74 targeting therapies to induce tumor regression and cancer cell apoptosis is described and results of clinical trials are discussed. Milatuzumab shows selective binding and rapid internalization into CD74-positive cancer cells. Milatuzumab with and without conjugated toxins synergizes with other chemotherapeutic agents and elicits significant antitumor effects in mice. In a Phase I trial, milatuzumab showed no severe adverse effects in patients with relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma and it stabilized the disease in some patients for up to 12 weeks. Ongoing trials testing different treatment schedules of milatuzumab in chronic lymphocytic leukemia, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and multiple myeloma indicate that milatuzumab shows no severe adverse effects in humans.","['Berkova, Zuzana', 'Tao, Rong-Hua', 'Samaniego, Felipe']","['Berkova Z', 'Tao RH', 'Samaniego F']","['The University of Texas, MD Anderson Cancer Center, Department of Lymphoma/Myeloma, Houston, Texas 77030, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,England,Expert Opin Investig Drugs,Expert opinion on investigational drugs,9434197,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, B-Lymphocyte)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Histocompatibility Antigens Class II)', '0 (invariant chain)', '2OP4E0GC6V (milatuzumab)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/administration & dosage/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized', 'Antigens, Differentiation, B-Lymphocyte/biosynthesis/*immunology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Drug Evaluation, Preclinical', 'Histocompatibility Antigens Class II/biosynthesis/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy/*methods', 'Neoplasms/*drug therapy/immunology/pathology']",2009/12/09 06:00,2010/03/17 06:00,['2009/12/09 06:00'],"['2009/12/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/12/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/03/17 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1517/13543780903463854 [doi]'],ppublish,Expert Opin Investig Drugs. 2010 Jan;19(1):141-9. doi: 10.1517/13543780903463854.,19,,,,,80,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Nucleoside analogues, either alone or in combination with additional therapeutic agents, are an essential part of first-line and salvage regimens directed against neoplastic diseases. However, many mechanistic studies on this class of drugs have been carried out in vitro or ex vivo at drug concentrations that are orders of magnitude higher than levels achieved in vivo. AREAS COVERED IN THIS REVIEW: In this paper, we focus on the anti-leukemic drug and nucleoside analogue, cladribine (2-chloro-2'-deoxyadenosine), to illustrate the difficulty in interpreting the significance of in vitro results obtained using drug concentrations that would be markedly deleterious to patients. WHAT THE READER WILL GAIN: We review numerous research reports that have been conducted at pharmacologically achievable drug levels compared to those using toxic concentrations and contrast the respective results. TAKE HOME MESSAGE: We propose that cellular responses to supra-pharmacological drug concentrations occur via distinctly different mechanisms and signaling pathways compared to the much lower plasma concentrations achieved with clinically relevant doses, and thus may not provide appropriate insights into a drug's mechanism of action.","['Hentosh, Patricia', 'Peffley, Dennis M']","['Hentosh P', 'Peffley DM']","['Old Dominion University, School of Medical Laboratory and Radiation Sciences College of Health Sciences, Norfolk, VA 23529, USA. phentosh@odu.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,England,Expert Opin Drug Metab Toxicol,Expert opinion on drug metabolism & toxicology,101228422,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '47M74X9YT5 (Cladribine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cladribine/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/drug therapy']",2009/12/09 06:00,2010/02/20 06:00,['2009/12/09 06:00'],"['2009/12/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/12/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/02/20 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1517/17425250903393745 [doi]'],ppublish,Expert Opin Drug Metab Toxicol. 2010 Jan;6(1):75-81. doi: 10.1517/17425250903393745.,6,,,,,65,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recently, it has been demonstrated that genotype distribution of several single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in genes that modulate G protein-signal transduction and apoptosis can serve as helpful predictive parameters in various carcinomas. We here aimed at extending the panel of SNPs suitable for predicting the outcome of CCA. METHODOLOGY: Forty Caucasian patients with extrahepatic CCA and 40 age- and sex-matched healthy white Caucasians were genotyped to elucidate putative associations between clinical outcome and genotypes of the three following SNPs: G protein beta 3 (GNB3) 825C>T, B-cell-lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2) -938C>A, and myeloid cell leukemia-1 (Mcl-1) -386C>G. RESULTS: Patients homozygous for the C allele of the GNB3 825C>T polymorphism exhibited a significant prolonged overall survival compared with patients displaying the CT or TT genotype (median survival [months]: 31 vs. 13 vs. 7; p < .05) and also showed lower bilirubin serum levels. Additionally, the CC genotype of the BCL2-938C>A polymorphism was associated with higher GLDH serum activities (U/l; 29.8 +/- 7.1 vs. 11.4 +/- 4.3 vs. 5.6 +/- 1.7 comparing CC vs. CA vs. AA; p < .05). Genotype distributions for all SNPs were not significantly different in patients vs. controls. CONCLUSIONS: GNB3 825C>T SNP may be a novel independent prognostic marker for patients suffering from extrahepatic CCA with the CC genotype to be associated with a favorable clinical outcome. Further prospective studies are needed to confirm these results and reveal additional functional SNP effects.","['Fingas, Christian Dominik', 'Katsounas, Antonios', 'Kahraman, Alisan', 'Siffert, Winfried', 'Jochum, Christoph', 'Gerken, Guido', 'Nuckel, Holger', 'Canbay, Ali']","['Fingas CD', 'Katsounas A', 'Kahraman A', 'Siffert W', 'Jochum C', 'Gerken G', 'Nuckel H', 'Canbay A']","['Department of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, University Hospital of Essen, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Cancer Invest,Cancer investigation,8307154,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (G-protein beta3 subunit)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', 'EC 3.6.5.1 (Heterotrimeric GTP-Binding Proteins)']",IM,"['Age Factors', 'Bile Duct Neoplasms/*genetics/mortality', '*Bile Ducts, Extrahepatic', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/metabolism', 'Body Mass Index', 'Cholangiocarcinoma/*genetics/mortality', 'Heterotrimeric GTP-Binding Proteins/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Middle Aged', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', '*Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide', 'Prognosis', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*genetics']",2009/12/09 06:00,2010/05/15 06:00,['2009/12/09 06:00'],"['2009/12/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/12/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/05/15 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3109/07357900903095714 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Invest. 2010 Jun;28(5):472-8. doi: 10.3109/07357900903095714.,28,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed the clinical data of 52 patients with IPFI secondary to MBD admitted to Peking Union Medical College Hospital from January 1995 to December 2008. RESULTS: The incidences of IPFI secondary to acute myeloid leukemia (AML), acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL), and aplastic anemia (AA) were 4.6%, 3.2%, 2.8%, and 2.5%, respectively. In patients with IPFI secondary to AML, 88.5% (23/26) of the patients suffered from the infections during the non-remission (NR) period (including relapse), and 11.5% (3/26) in the complete-remission (CR) period. In all the patients with IPFI secondary to malignant blood diseases, 86.5% (45/52) of MBD were neutropenic or agranulocytic, and 67.3% (35/52) had been treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics for more than 96 hours before anti-fungal therapy. The total mortality after anti-fungal therapy was 13.7% (7/51). More than half of patients with fluconazole or itraconazole as the first-line therapy had to switch to other medicines because of poor infection control. CONCLUSIONS: IPFI secondary to MBD is most common in AML patients. Patients with NR of AML, neutropenia or agranulocytosis, and long-term broad-spectrum antibiotics usage are susceptible to IPFI. Fluconazole and itraconazole have low efficacy, and other more potent anti-fungal medicines should be considered.","['Sun, Xue-Feng', 'Han, Bing', 'Feng, Jun', 'Zhou, Dao-Bin', 'Wang, Shu-Jie', 'Xu, Ying', 'Chen, Jia-Lin', 'Jiao, Li', 'Zhang, Wei', 'Li, Jian', 'Duan, Ming-Hui', 'Zhu, Tie-Nan', 'Zou, Nong', 'Hua, Bao-Lai', 'Cai, Hua-Cong', 'Zhao, Yong-Qiang']","['Sun XF', 'Han B', 'Feng J', 'Zhou DB', 'Wang SJ', 'Xu Y', 'Chen JL', 'Jiao L', 'Zhang W', 'Li J', 'Duan MH', 'Zhu TN', 'Zou N', 'Hua BL', 'Cai HC', 'Zhao YQ']","['Department of Hematology, PUMC Hospital, CAMS and PUMC, Beijing 100730, China.']",['chi'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",,China,Zhongguo Yi Xue Ke Xue Yuan Xue Bao,Zhongguo yi xue ke xue yuan xue bao.

Distinction of hematogones is critical for disease management particularly after therapy of paediatric B acute lymphoblastic leukaemia to monitor for minimal residual disease.","['Braham Jmili, N', 'Nsaibia, S', 'Jacob, M C', 'Omri, H', 'Laatiri, M A', 'Yacoub, S', 'Braham, Y', 'Aouni, M', 'Kortas, M']","['Braham Jmili N', 'Nsaibia S', 'Jacob MC', 'Omri H', 'Laatiri MA', 'Yacoub S', 'Braham Y', 'Aouni M', 'Kortas M']","['Faculty of Pharmacy, University of Center, Monastir, Tunisia. jmilinejia@yahoo.fr']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Clin Lab Sci,Clinical laboratory science : journal of the American Society for Medical Technology,8806547,"['0 (Antigens, CD)']",,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Aging/immunology/pathology', 'Antigens, CD/metabolism', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Precursor Cells, B-Lymphoid/*cytology/*immunology', 'Prospective Studies', 'Young Adult']",2009/12/09 06:00,2010/02/19 06:00,['2009/12/09 06:00'],"['2009/12/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/12/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/02/19 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Clin Lab Sci. 2009 Fall;22(4):208-15.,22,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although resistance has been observed in a proportion of patients, sudden blastic crisis is a rare event during imatinib therapy. We describe a 24-year-old male patient with Philadelphia chromosome-positive chronic myeloid leukemia in chronic phase who developed sudden blastic crisis in the 24th month of imatinib therapy, with loss of complete cytogenetic response. At this time, the patient had splenomegaly, severe anemia, thrombocytopenia, and leukocytosis. Bone marrow aspirate revealed the presence of massive blastic infiltration with myeloid morphology. Flow cytometric analysis of the bone marrow cells showed positivity for CD45, CD34, CD13, CD33, CD19, CD41, CD61, and glycophorin-A. Trephine biopsy specimens showed 100% cellular marrow with diffuse infiltrate by blasts. A reticulin stain of the bone marrow biopsy section demonstrated severe diffuse fibrosis. Cytogenetic analysis by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) revealed that 92% of the cells were positive for the BCR/ABL fusion signal and had increased copy numbers for chromosomes 8, 13, 19, and 21. The patient's prognosis was unfavorable. In conclusion, chronic myeloid leukemia remains complex and includes unanswered questions. The presented case with a rare event during imatinib therapy highlights the need for the continued monitoring of residual disease and the development of strategies to eliminate residual leukemia cells in patients showing a complete cytogenetic response.","['Ali, Ridvan', 'Ozkalemkas, Fahir', 'Ozkocaman, Vildan', 'Yakut, Tahsin', 'Nazlioglu, Hulya Ozturk', 'Budak, Ferah', 'Pekgoz, Murat', 'Korkmaz, Serhat', 'Karkucak, Mutlu', 'Ozcelik, Tulay', 'Tunali, Ahmet']","['Ali R', 'Ozkalemkas F', 'Ozkocaman V', 'Yakut T', 'Nazlioglu HO', 'Budak F', 'Pekgoz M', 'Korkmaz S', 'Karkucak M', 'Ozcelik T', 'Tunali A']","['Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, Uludag University School of Medicine Hospital, 16059 Gorukle, Bursa, Turkey. ridvanali@uludag.edu.tr']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",20091205,Japan,Int J Clin Oncol,International journal of clinical oncology,9616295,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Benzamides', 'Blast Crisis/*diagnosis/pathology', '*Chromosome Aberrations', 'Cytogenetic Analysis', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/diagnosis/*drug therapy/*pathology', 'Male', 'Piperazines/*therapeutic use', 'Pyrimidines/*therapeutic use']",2009/12/08 06:00,2010/04/01 06:00,['2009/12/08 06:00'],"['2008/10/20 00:00 [received]', '2009/02/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/12/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/12/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/04/01 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s10147-009-0884-5 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Clin Oncol. 2009 Dec;14(6):545-50. doi: 10.1007/s10147-009-0884-5.

The extracellular matrix component fibronectin has been known to modulate the cell cycle dynamics, viability and differentiation of leukaemia cells. Thus, our aim was to investigate the influence of fibronectin substratum on the liposomal transfection of myeloid leukaemia cell lines. Liposomal transfection was performed with K562 and HL-60 as representative lines of transfection-competent and -incompetent myeloid leukaemia cells, respectively. Flow cytometry analyses were performed to determine transfection efficiency monitored by green fluorescent protein (GFP) expression and to assess cell viability and cell cycle status. Quantitation of GFP gene expression and DNA uptake was assayed by real time PCR. The current data showed that the adhesion to fibronectin deteriorated the transfection of K562 cells. In contrary, it enhanced the delivery of plasmid DNA into HL-60 cells. Correspondingly, the adhesion to fibronectin influenced the transfection efficiency mainly by modulating the intracellular presence of plasmid DNA. The cell cycle and viability which is regulated by fibronectin had a minor impact on the success of gene delivery. This phenomenon may be considered as an important factor which may modulate the potential gene transfer approaches for myeloid leukaemia.","['Esendagli, Gunes', 'Canpinar, Hande', 'Lale Dogan, A', 'Akkaya, Munir', 'Kansu, Emin', 'Guc, Dicle']","['Esendagli G', 'Canpinar H', 'Lale Dogan A', 'Akkaya M', 'Kansu E', 'Guc D']","['Department of Basic Oncology, Institute of Oncology, Hacettepe University, 06100, Sihhiye, Ankara, Turkey, gunese@hacettepe.edu.tr.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20091206,United States,Cytotechnology,Cytotechnology,8807027,,,,2009/12/08 06:00,2009/12/08 06:01,['2009/12/08 06:00'],"['2009/04/30 00:00 [received]', '2009/11/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/12/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/12/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2009/12/08 06:01 [medline]']",['10.1007/s10616-009-9241-9 [doi]'],ppublish,Cytotechnology. 2009 Nov;61(1-2):45-53. doi: 10.1007/s10616-009-9241-9.

Physicians are often uncertain about how to identify patients who may benefit from specific treatment strategies. The International Prognostic Scoring System is a widely used tool to assess the risk of transformation to leukemia and to guide treatment decisions, but it fails to take into account many aspects of treating elderly patients, including comorbid illnesses, secondary causes of MDS, prior therapy for MDS, and other age-related health, functional, cognitive, and social problems that affect the outcome and managing of myelodysplastic symptoms. Patients with low-risk disease traditionally have been given only best supportive care, but evidence is increasing that treatment with novel non-conventional drugs such as lenalidomide or methyltransferase inhibitors may influence the natural history of the disease and should be used in conjunction with supportive-care measures. Supportive care of these patients could also be improved in order to enhance their quality of life and functional performance. Elderly patients commonly have multiple medical problems and use medications to deal with these. In addition, they are more likely to have more than one health care provider. These factors all increase the risk of drug interactions and the consequent treatment of toxicities. Manifestations of common toxicities or illnesses may be more subtle in the elderly, owing to age-associated functional deficits in multiple organ systems. Particularly important to the elderly MDS patient is the age-related decline in normal bone marrow function, including the diminished capacity of response to stressors such as infection or myelosuppressive treatments. Through the integration of geriatric and oncological strategies, a personalized approach toward this unique population may be applied. As with many diseases in the elderly, reliance on family members or friends to maintain the prescribed treatments, including travel to and from appointments, may place additional stressors on the patient and his/her support network. Careful evaluation and knowledge of functional status, ability to tolerate treatments, effect of disease progression, and general overall health conditions can provide the best opportunity to support these patients. Immediate assessment of daily living activities may detect deficiencies or deficits that often require early interventions.","['Ria, R', 'Moschetta, M', 'Reale, A', 'Mangialardi, G', 'Castrovilli, A', 'Vacca, A', 'Dammacco, F']","['Ria R', 'Moschetta M', 'Reale A', 'Mangialardi G', 'Castrovilli A', 'Vacca A', 'Dammacco F']","['Department of Biomedical Sciences and Human Oncology, Section of Internal Medicine and Clinical Oncology, University of Bari Medical School, Bari, Italy. ria@dimo.uniba.it']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20091118,New Zealand,Clin Interv Aging,Clinical interventions in aging,101273480,,IM,"['Aged', 'Anemia', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Humans', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*drug therapy/epidemiology/physiopathology', 'Quality of Life', 'United States/epidemiology']",2009/12/08 06:00,2010/04/08 06:00,['2009/12/08 06:00'],"['2009/10/14 00:00 [received]', '2009/12/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/12/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/04/08 06:00 [medline]']",['10.2147/cia.s5203 [doi]'],ppublish,Clin Interv Aging. 2009;4:413-23. doi: 10.2147/cia.s5203.

To uncover such novel alterations, we performed an array-based comparative genomic hybridization survey of 128 non-small-cell lung cancer cell lines and tumors. Prominent among our findings, we identified recurrent high-level amplification at cytoband 22q11.21 in 3% of lung cancer specimens, with another 11% of specimens exhibiting low-level gain spanning that locus. The 22q11.21 amplicon core contained eight named genes, only four of which were overexpressed (by transcript profiling) when amplified. Among these, CRKL encodes an adapter protein functioning in signal transduction, best known as a substrate of the BCR-ABL kinase in chronic myelogenous leukemia. RNA-interference-mediated knockdown of CRKL in lung cancer cell lines with (but not without) amplification led to significantly decreased cell proliferation, cell-cycle progression, cell survival, and cell motility and invasion. In addition, overexpression of CRKL in immortalized human bronchial epithelial cells led to enhanced growth factor-independent cell growth. Our findings indicate that amplification and resultant overexpression of CRKL contribute to diverse oncogenic phenotypes in lung cancer, with implications for targeted therapy, and highlight a role of adapter proteins as primary genetic drivers of tumorigenesis.","['Kim, Y H', 'Kwei, K A', 'Girard, L', 'Salari, K', 'Kao, J', 'Pacyna-Gengelbach, M', 'Wang, P', 'Hernandez-Boussard, T', 'Gazdar, A F', 'Petersen, I', 'Minna, J D', 'Pollack, J R']","['Kim YH', 'Kwei KA', 'Girard L', 'Salari K', 'Kao J', 'Pacyna-Gengelbach M', 'Wang P', 'Hernandez-Boussard T', 'Gazdar AF', 'Petersen I', 'Minna JD', 'Pollack JR']","['Department of Pathology, Stanford University, Stanford, CA 94305-5176, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",20091207,England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (CRKL protein)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)']",IM,"['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing/*genetics/metabolism/physiology', 'Blotting, Western', 'Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung/genetics/pathology/physiopathology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Movement', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cell Survival', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 22/genetics', 'Comparative Genomic Hybridization', '*Gene Amplification', '*Gene Expression Profiling', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Lung Neoplasms/*genetics/pathology/physiopathology', 'Nuclear Proteins/*genetics/metabolism/physiology', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'RNA Interference']",2009/12/08 06:00,2010/04/24 06:00,['2009/12/08 06:00'],"['2009/12/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/12/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/04/24 06:00 [medline]']","['onc2009437 [pii]', '10.1038/onc.2009.437 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2010 Mar 11;29(10):1421-30. doi: 10.1038/onc.2009.437.

This specificity could be used to preferentially kill these cells. In this study, we identified the signaling pathway initiated by glycolysis inhibition that results in sensitization to death receptor (DR)-induced apoptosis. We showed, in several human cancer cell lines (such as Jurkat, HeLa, U937), that glucose removal or the use of nonmetabolizable form of glucose (2-deoxyglucose) dramatically enhances apoptosis induced by Fas or by tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand. This sensitization is controlled through the adenosine monophosphate (AMP)-activated protein kinase (AMPK), which is the central energy-sensing system of the cell. We established the fact that AMPK is activated upon glycolysis block resulting in mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibition leading to Mcl-1 decrease, but no other Bcl-2 anti-apoptotic members. Interestingly, we determined that, upon glycolysis inhibition, the AMPK-mTOR pathway controlled Mcl-1 levels neither through transcriptional nor through posttranslational mechanism but rather by controlling its translation. Therefore, our results show a novel mechanism for the sensitization to DR-induced apoptosis linking glucose metabolism to Mcl-1 downexpression. In addition, this study provides a rationale for the combined use of DR ligands with AMPK activators or mTOR inhibitors in the treatment of human cancers.","['Pradelli, L A', 'Beneteau, M', 'Chauvin, C', 'Jacquin, M A', 'Marchetti, S', 'Munoz-Pinedo, C', 'Auberger, P', 'Pende, M', 'Ricci, J-E']","['Pradelli LA', 'Beneteau M', 'Chauvin C', 'Jacquin MA', 'Marchetti S', 'Munoz-Pinedo C', 'Auberger P', 'Pende M', 'Ricci JE']","['Inserm, U895, Centre Mediterraneen de Medecine Moleculaire (C3M), equipe 3 - AVENIR, Nice, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20091207,England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (Antibodies)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Pyrazoles)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Receptors, Death Domain)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Ribonucleotides)', '0 (TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand)', '0 (TNFSF10 protein, human)', '0 (fas Receptor)', '10K52CIC1Z (dorsomorphin)', '360-97-4 (Aminoimidazole Carboxamide)', '9G2MP84A8W (Deoxyglucose)', 'EC 2.7.1.1 (MTOR protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.31 (AMP-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'F0X88YW0YK (AICA ribonucleotide)', 'IY9XDZ35W2 (Glucose)', 'W36ZG6FT64 (Sirolimus)']",IM,"['AMP-Activated Protein Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Aminoimidazole Carboxamide/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Antibodies/immunology/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects/*physiology', 'Blotting, Western', 'Deoxyglucose/pharmacology', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Glucose/pharmacology', 'Glycolysis/drug effects/*physiology', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Models, Biological', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Protein Biosynthesis/drug effects', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/genetics/*metabolism', 'Pyrazoles/pharmacology', 'Pyrimidines/pharmacology', 'RNA Interference', 'Receptors, Death Domain/immunology/*metabolism', 'Recombinant Proteins/pharmacology', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Ribonucleotides/pharmacology', 'Sirolimus/pharmacology', 'TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand/genetics/metabolism/pharmacology', 'TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases', 'U937 Cells', 'fas Receptor/immunology/metabolism']",2009/12/08 06:00,2010/04/24 06:00,['2009/12/08 06:00'],"['2009/12/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/12/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/04/24 06:00 [medline]']","['onc2009448 [pii]', '10.1038/onc.2009.448 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2010 Mar 18;29(11):1641-52. doi: 10.1038/onc.2009.448.

Genetic ablation of pTalpha expression in Notch3 transgenic mice abrogates tumor development, indicating that pTalpha signaling is crucial to the Notch3-mediated leukemogenesis. Here we report a novel direct interaction between Notch3 and pTalpha. This interaction leads to the recruitment and persistence of the E3 ligase protein c-Cbl to the lipid rafts in Notch3-IC transgenic thymocytes. Conversely, deletion of pTalpha in Notch3 transgenic mice leads to cytoplasmic retention of c-Cbl that targets Notch3 protein to the proteasomal-degradative pathway. It appears that protein kinase C theta (PKCtheta), by regulating tyrosine and serine phosphorylation of Cbl, is able to control its function. We report here that the increased Notch3-IC degradation correlates with higher levels of c-Cbl tyrosine phosphorylation in Notch3-IC/pTalpha(-/-) double-mutant thymocytes, which also display a decreased PKCtheta activity.

Timely expression of the hematopoietic master regulator PU.1 is crucial for normal development of myeloid and lymphoid cells. Targeted disruption of an upstream regulatory element (URE) located several kb upstream in the PU.1 promoter decreases PU.1 expression thereby inducing AML in mice. In addition, suppression of PU.1 has been observed in specific subtypes of human AML. Here, we identified nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) to activate PU.1 expression through a novel site within the URE. We found sequence variations of this particular NF-kappaB site in 4 of 120 AML patients. These variant NF-kappaB sequences failed to mediate activation of PU.1. Moreover, the synergistic activation of PU.1 together with CEBPB through these variant sequences was also lost. Finally, AML patients with such variant sequences had suppressed PU.1 mRNA expression. This study suggests that changes of a single base pair in a distal element critically affect the regulation of the tumor suppressor gene PU.1 thereby contributing to the development of AML.","['Bonadies, N', 'Neururer, Ch', 'Steege, A', 'Vallabhapurapu, S', 'Pabst, T', 'Mueller, B U']","['Bonadies N', 'Neururer Ch', 'Steege A', 'Vallabhapurapu S', 'Pabst T', 'Mueller BU']","['Department of Internal Medicine and Clinical Research, University Hospital Bern, University of Bern, Bern, Switzerland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20091207,England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Protein-beta)', '0 (CEBPB protein, human)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (proto-oncogene protein Spi-1)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Binding Sites', 'CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Protein-beta/metabolism', 'COS Cells', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cell Differentiation/genetics', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Chlorocebus aethiops', 'Enhancer Elements, Genetic/*genetics', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/metabolism', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Middle Aged', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'NF-kappa B/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Neutrophils/cytology/metabolism', 'Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide', 'Protein Multimerization', 'Protein Structure, Quaternary', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'Sequence Homology, Nucleic Acid', 'Trans-Activators/*genetics/metabolism', 'Young Adult']",2009/12/08 06:00,2010/03/13 06:00,['2009/12/08 06:00'],"['2009/12/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/12/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/03/13 06:00 [medline]']","['onc2009371 [pii]', '10.1038/onc.2009.371 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2010 Feb 18;29(7):1062-72. doi: 10.1038/onc.2009.371.

The effects of G. lucidum on the survival rate of WEHI-3 leukemia cells injected into BALB/c mice were examined. It increased the percentages of CD3 and CD19, but decreased the percentages of Mac-3 and CD11b markers, suggesting that differentiation of the precursor of T and B cells was promoted but macrophages were inhibited. It decreased the weight of spleens as compared with control mice. It also promoted phagocytosis by macrophage from peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) and it also promoted natural killer cell activity.

Their therapeutic effect is based on their ability to catalyze the conversion of L-asparagine, an essential amino acid in certain tumours, to L-aspartic acid and ammonia. Two L-asparaginases, one from Escherichia coli and the other from Erwinia chrysanthemi, have been widely employed in clinical practice as anti-leukaemia drugs. However, L-asparaginases are also able to cause severe side effects owing to their intrinsic glutaminase activity. Helicobacter pylori L-asparaginase (HpA) has been reported to have negligible glutaminase activity. To gain insight into the properties of HpA, its crystal structure in the presence of L-aspartate was determined to 1.4 A resolution, which is one of the highest resolutions obtained for an L-asparaginase structure. The final structure has an R(cryst) of 12.6% (R(free) = 16.9%) with good stereochemistry. A detailed analysis of the active site showed major differences in the active-site flexible loop and in the 286-297 loop from the second subunit, which is involved in active-site formation. Accordingly, Glu289, Asn255 and Gln63 are suggested to play roles in modulating the accessibility of the active site. Overall, the structural comparison revealed that HpA has greater structural similarity to E. coli L-asparaginase than to any other L-asparaginase, including Er. carotovora L-asparaginase, despite the fact that the latter is also characterized by low glutaminase activity.","['Dhavala, Prathusha', 'Papageorgiou, Anastassios C']","['Dhavala P', 'Papageorgiou AC']","['Turku Centre for Biotechnology, University of Turku and Abo Akademi University, Finland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20091117,United States,Acta Crystallogr D Biol Crystallogr,"Acta crystallographica.

We have characterized the signal transduction pathways regulating the catabolisis of p45/NF-E2, a bZIP factor activating the erythroid and megakaryocytic gene transcription. Through use of different approaches including nano-scale proteomics, we show that activated-JNK, or Phospho-JNK (P-JNK), physically interacts with p45/NF-E2 and phosphorylates its Ser157 residue. This reaction leads to the poly-ubiquitination of p45/NF-E2 at one or more of six Lys residues, one of which being also a sumoylation site, and its degradation through the proteasome pathway. Significantly, this regulatory pathway of p45/NF-E2 by P-JNK exists only in uninduced murine erythroleukemia (MEL) cells but not in differentiated MEL cells in which JNK is inactivated on DMSO induction. Based on the above data and analysis of the chromatin-binding kinetics of p45/NF-E2 and the erythroid gene repressor Bach1 during the early phase of MEL differentiation, we suggest a model for the regulation of erythroid maturation. In the model, the posttranslational modifications and turnover of p45/NF-E2, as mediated by P-JNK, contribute to the control of its homeostatic concentration and consequently, its regulatory functions in the progression of erythroid differentiation and erythroid gene expression.","['Lee, Tung-Liang', 'Shyu, Yu-Chiau', 'Hsu, Pang-Hung', 'Chang, Chiung-Wen', 'Wen, Shau-Ching', 'Hsiao, Wei-Yuan', 'Tsai, Ming-Daw', 'Shen, Che-Kun James']","['Lee TL', 'Shyu YC', 'Hsu PH', 'Chang CW', 'Wen SC', 'Hsiao WY', 'Tsai MD', 'Shen CK']","['Institute of Molecular Biology, Academia Sinica, Taipei 115, Taiwan, Republic of China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20091204,United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (BACH1 protein, human)', '0 (Basic-Leucine Zipper Transcription Factors)', '0 (Fanconi Anemia Complementation Group Proteins)', '0 (NF-E2 Transcription Factor, p45 Subunit)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 3.4.25.1 (Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Basic-Leucine Zipper Transcription Factors/genetics/metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation/*physiology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Fanconi Anemia Complementation Group Proteins/genetics/metabolism', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/genetics/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'NF-E2 Transcription Factor, p45 Subunit/genetics/*metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex/metabolism', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/*physiology']",2009/12/08 06:00,2010/03/10 06:00,['2009/12/08 06:00'],"['2009/12/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/12/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/03/10 06:00 [medline]']","['0909153107 [pii]', '10.1073/pnas.0909153107 [doi]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2010 Jan 5;107(1):52-7. doi: 10.1073/pnas.0909153107.

We describe a novel t(12;18)(p13;q12) involving ETV6 in a patient with AML. The translocation resulted in overexpression of SETBP1 (18q12), located close to the breakpoint. Overexpression of SETBP1 through retroviral insertion has been reported to confer growth advantage in hematopoietic progenitor cells. We show that SETBP1 overexpression protects SET from protease cleavage, increasing the amount of full-length SET protein and leading to the formation of a SETBP1-SET-PP2A complex that results in PP2A inhibition, promoting proliferation of the leukemic cells. The prevalence of SETBP1 overexpression in AML at diagnosis (n = 192) was 27.6% and was associated with unfavorable cytogenetic prognostic group, monosomy 7, and EVI1 overexpression (P < .01). Patients with SETBP1 overexpression had a significantly shorter overall survival, and the prognosis impact was remarkably poor in patients older than 60 years in both overall survival (P = .015) and event-free survival (P = .015). In summary, our data show a novel leukemogenic mechanism through SETBP1 overexpression; moreover, multivariate analysis confirms the negative prognostic impact of SETBP1 overexpression in AML, especially in elderly patients, where it could be used as a predictive factor in any future clinical trials with PP2A activators.","['Cristobal, Ion', 'Blanco, Francisco J', 'Garcia-Orti, Laura', 'Marcotegui, Nerea', 'Vicente, Carmen', 'Rifon, Jose', 'Novo, Francisco J', 'Bandres, Eva', 'Calasanz, Maria J', 'Bernabeu, Carmelo', 'Odero, Maria D']","['Cristobal I', 'Blanco FJ', 'Garcia-Orti L', 'Marcotegui N', 'Vicente C', 'Rifon J', 'Novo FJ', 'Bandres E', 'Calasanz MJ', 'Bernabeu C', 'Odero MD']","['Division of Oncology, Center for Applied Medical Research, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20091116,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (SETBP1 protein, human)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Base Sequence', 'Carrier Proteins/*genetics', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/*genetics', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*diagnosis/*genetics', 'Male', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Nuclear Proteins/*genetics', 'Prognosis', 'Up-Regulation']",2009/12/08 06:00,2010/02/24 06:00,['2009/12/08 06:00'],"['2009/12/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/12/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/02/24 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)49321-8 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2009-06-227363 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2010 Jan 21;115(3):615-25. doi: 10.1182/blood-2009-06-227363.

We demonstrate that SMI-4a, a novel benzylidene-thiazolidine-2, 4-dione small molecule inhibitor of the Pim kinases, kills a wide range of both myeloid and lymphoid cell lines with precursor T-cell lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma (pre-T-LBL/T-ALL) being highly sensitive. Incubation of pre-T-LBL cells with SMI-4a induced G1 phase cell-cycle arrest secondary to a dose-dependent induction of p27(Kip1), apoptosis through the mitochondrial pathway, and inhibition of the mammalian target of rapamycin C1 (mTORC1) pathway based on decreases in phospho-p70 S6K and phospho-4E-BP1, 2 substrates of this enzyme. In addition, treatment of these cells with SMI-4a was found to induce phosphorylation of extracellular signal-related kinase1/2 (ERK1/2), and the combination of SMI-4a and a mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 1/2 (MEK1/2) inhibitor was highly synergistic in killing pre-T-LBL cells. In immunodeficient mice carrying subcutaneous pre-T-LBL tumors, treatment twice daily with SMI-4a caused a significant delay in the tumor growth without any change in the weight, blood counts, or chemistries. Our data suggest that inhibition of the Pim protein kinases may be developed as a therapeutic strategy for the treatment of pre-T-LBL.","['Lin, Ying-Wei', 'Beharry, Zanna M', 'Hill, Elizabeth G', 'Song, Jin H', 'Wang, Wenxue', 'Xia, Zuping', 'Zhang, Zhenhua', 'Aplan, Peter D', 'Aster, Jon C', 'Smith, Charles D', 'Kraft, Andrew S']","['Lin YW', 'Beharry ZM', 'Hill EG', 'Song JH', 'Wang W', 'Xia Z', 'Zhang Z', 'Aplan PD', 'Aster JC', 'Smith CD', 'Kraft AS']","['Department of Pediatrics, Hollings Cancer Center, Medical University of South Carolina, Charleston, SC, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20091123,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Benzylidene Compounds)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (MYC protein, human)', '0 (PIM2 protein, human)', '0 (Pim2 protein, mouse)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc)', '0 (SMI-4a compound)', '0 (Thiazolidinediones)', 'EC 2.7.1.1 (MTOR protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.1.1 (mTOR protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (PIM1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (PIM3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Pim1 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Pim3 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-pim-1)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Benzylidene Compounds/*pharmacology', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases/metabolism', 'G1 Phase/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/metabolism', 'Jurkat Cells', 'MAP Kinase Signaling System/drug effects', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/*metabolism', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc/genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-pim-1/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases', 'Thiazolidinediones/*pharmacology']",2009/12/08 06:00,2010/03/13 06:00,['2009/12/08 06:00'],"['2009/12/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/12/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/03/13 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)49281-X [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2009-07-233445 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2010 Jan 28;115(4):824-33. doi: 10.1182/blood-2009-07-233445.

Degranulation and cytotoxic carboxyfluorescein diacetate succinimidyl ester-based assays showed major histocompatibility complex-restricted APL-specific T cell-mediated immune responses.

We have studied whether VEGF regulates MMP-9. VEGF significantly reduced MMP-9 protein expression in a dose-dependent manner, measured by gelatin zymography. Blocking the VEGFR2 receptor restored MMP-9 levels, implicating this receptor in the observed effect. Down-regulation of MMP-9 by VEGF resulted in significant inhibition of B-CLL cell migration through Matrigel or human umbilical vein endothelial cells, confirming the crucial role of MMP-9 in these processes. Reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction analyses revealed that VEGF regulated MMP-9 at the transcriptional level. Indeed, VEGF induced STAT1 tyrosine phosphorylation, and this was blocked by inhibiting VEGFR2. STAT1 was responsible for MMP-9 down-regulation, as STAT1 gene silencing restored MMP-9 production and B-CLL cell migration in the presence of VEGF. Thus, the levels of VEGF and MMP-9 influence B-CLL cell expansion and both molecules could constitute therapeutic targets for this disease.","['Ugarte-Berzal, Estefania', 'Redondo-Munoz, Javier', 'Eroles, Pilar', 'Del Cerro, Mercedes Hernandez', 'Garcia-Marco, Jose A', 'Terol, Maria Jose', 'Garcia-Pardo, Angeles']","['Ugarte-Berzal E', 'Redondo-Munoz J', 'Eroles P', 'Del Cerro MH', 'Garcia-Marco JA', 'Terol MJ', 'Garcia-Pardo A']","['Cellular and Molecular Medicine Programme, Centro de Investigaciones Biologicas, Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas, Madrid, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20091119,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (STAT1 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT1 protein, human)', '0 (VEGFA protein, human)', '0 (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Receptor-2)', 'EC 3.4.24.35 (Matrix Metalloproteinase 9)']",IM,"['B-Lymphocytes/cytology/metabolism', 'Cell Movement/drug effects/physiology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Down-Regulation/drug effects/physiology', 'Endothelial Cells/cytology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*metabolism/*pathology', 'Matrix Metalloproteinase 9/*metabolism', 'RNA, Small Interfering', 'STAT1 Transcription Factor/genetics/*metabolism', 'Umbilical Veins/cytology', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Receptor-2/*metabolism']",2009/12/08 06:00,2010/03/13 06:00,['2009/12/08 06:00'],"['2009/12/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/12/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/03/13 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)49283-3 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2009-08-239426 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2010 Jan 28;115(4):846-9. doi: 10.1182/blood-2009-08-239426.

Persistent HTLV-1 infection is determined by a balance between host immune responses and virus spread. Immunomodulatory therapy involving HTLV-1-infected patients occurs in a variety of clinical settings. Knowledge of how these treatments influence host-virus relationships is not understood. In this study, we examined the effects of cyclosporine A (CsA)-induced immune suppression during early infection of HTLV-1. Twenty-four New Zealand white rabbits were split into 4 groups. Three groups were treated with either 10 or 20 mg/kg CsA or saline before infection. The fourth group was treated with 20 mg/kg CsA 1 week after infection. Immune suppression, plasma CsA concentration, ex vivo lymphocyte HTLV-1 p19 production, anti-HTLV-1 serologic responses, and proviral load levels were measured during infection. Our data indicated that CsA treatment before HTLV-1 infection enhanced early viral expression compared with untreated HTLV-1-infected rabbits, and altered long-term viral expression parameters. However, CsA treatment 1 week after infection diminished HTLV-1 expression throughout the 10-week study course. Collectively, these data indicate immunologic control is a key determinant of early HTLV-1 spread and have important implications for therapeutic intervention during HTLV-1-associated diseases.","['Haynes, Rashade A H 2nd', 'Ware, Evan', 'Premanandan, Christopher', 'Zimmerman, Bevin', 'Yu, Lianbo', 'Phipps, Andrew J', 'Lairmore, Michael D']","['Haynes RA 2nd', 'Ware E', 'Premanandan C', 'Zimmerman B', 'Yu L', 'Phipps AJ', 'Lairmore MD']","['Center for Retrovirus Research and Department of Veterinary Biosciences, The Ohio State University, Columbus, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20091120,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Gene Products, env)', '0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)', '0 (Retroviridae Proteins, Oncogenic)', '0 (gag Gene Products, Human Immunodeficiency Virus)', '0 (gp46 protein, Human T-cell leukemia virus type I)', '0 (p19 protein, Human T-lymphotropic virus 1)', '83HN0GTJ6D (Cyclosporine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'CD4-CD8 Ratio', 'Cyclosporine/blood/*pharmacology', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Female', 'Gene Products, env/genetics/metabolism', 'HTLV-I Infections/*immunology', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*growth & development/*immunology', 'Humans', '*Immunocompromised Host', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/blood/*pharmacology', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Lymphocytosis/immunology/virology', 'Lymphoma, T-Cell/virology', 'Rabbits', 'Retroviridae Proteins, Oncogenic/genetics/metabolism', 'T-Lymphocytes, Helper-Inducer/cytology/transplantation/virology', 'Viral Load/drug effects', 'gag Gene Products, Human Immunodeficiency Virus/genetics/metabolism']",2009/12/08 06:00,2010/03/13 06:00,['2009/12/08 06:00'],"['2009/12/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/12/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/03/13 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)49280-8 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2009-07-230912 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2010 Jan 28;115(4):815-23. doi: 10.1182/blood-2009-07-230912.

Gene expression profiling was performed on 144 cases of PTCL and natural killer cell lymphoma and robust molecular classifiers were constructed for angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma (AITL), anaplastic lymphoma kinase-positive (ALK(+)) anaplastic large-cell lymphoma (ALCL), and adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma. PTCL-unclassifiable was molecularly heterogeneous, but we were able to identify a molecular subgroup with features of cytotoxic T lymphocytes and a poor survival compared with the remaining PTCL-not otherwise specified cases. Many of the pathologic features and substantial components of the molecular signature of AITL are contributed by the follicular dendritic cells, B-cell, and other stromal components. The expression of Th17-associated molecules in ALK(+) ALCL was noted and may represent aberrant activation of Th17-cell differentiation by abnormal cytokine secretion. Adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma has a homogeneous molecular signature demonstrating high expression of human T-lymphotropic virus type 1-induced genes. These classifiers reflect the biology of the tumor cells as well as their microenvironment. We also constructed a molecular prognosticator for AITL that appears to be largely related to the microenvironmental signature, and the high expression of 2 immunosuppressive signatures are associated with poor outcome. Oncogenic pathways and tumor-host interactions also were identified, and these findings may lead to better therapies and outcome in the future.","['Iqbal, Javeed', 'Weisenburger, Dennis D', 'Greiner, Timothy C', 'Vose, Julie M', 'McKeithan, Timothy', 'Kucuk, Can', 'Geng, Huimin', 'Deffenbacher, Karen', 'Smith, Lynette', 'Dybkaer, Karen', 'Nakamura, Shigeo', 'Seto, Masao', 'Delabie, Jan', 'Berger, Francoise', 'Loong, Florence', 'Au, Wing Y', 'Ko, Young-Hyeh', 'Sng, Ivy', 'Armitage, James Olen', 'Chan, Wing C']","['Iqbal J', 'Weisenburger DD', 'Greiner TC', 'Vose JM', 'McKeithan T', 'Kucuk C', 'Geng H', 'Deffenbacher K', 'Smith L', 'Dybkaer K', 'Nakamura S', 'Seto M', 'Delabie J', 'Berger F', 'Loong F', 'Au WY', 'Ko YH', 'Sng I', 'Armitage JO', 'Chan WC']","['Department of Pathology and Microbiology, University of Nebraska Medical Center, Omaha, NE 68198-3135, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20091118,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['EC 2.7.10.1 (ALK protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Anaplastic Lymphoma Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Anaplastic Lymphoma Kinase', 'Cell Line', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Child', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Female', '*Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Rearrangement, gamma-Chain T-Cell Antigen Receptor/genetics', 'Humans', 'Immunoblastic Lymphadenopathy/diagnosis/enzymology/*genetics', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Lymphoma, T-Cell/diagnosis/enzymology/*genetics', 'Lymphoma, T-Cell, Peripheral/diagnosis/enzymology/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/genetics/metabolism', 'Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases', 'Young Adult']",2009/12/08 06:00,2010/03/06 06:00,['2009/12/08 06:00'],"['2009/12/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/12/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/03/06 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)37482-6 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2009-06-227579 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2010 Feb 4;115(5):1026-36. doi: 10.1182/blood-2009-06-227579.

However, it is unknown whether PTEN functions as a tumor suppressor in human Philadelphia chromosome-positive leukemia that includes chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) and B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) and is induced by the BCR-ABL oncogene. By using our mouse model of BCR-ABL-induced leukemias, we show that Pten is down-regulated by BCR-ABL in leukemia stem cells in CML and that PTEN deletion causes acceleration of CML development. In addition, overexpression of PTEN delays the development of CML and B-ALL and prolongs survival of leukemia mice. PTEN suppresses leukemia stem cells and induces cell-cycle arrest of leukemia cells. Moreover, PTEN suppresses B-ALL development through regulating its downstream gene Akt1. These results demonstrate a critical role of PTEN in BCR-ABL-induced leukemias and suggest a potential strategy for the treatment of Philadelphia chromosome-positive leukemia.","['Peng, Cong', 'Chen, Yaoyu', 'Yang, Zhongfa', 'Zhang, Haojian', 'Osterby, Lori', 'Rosmarin, Alan G', 'Li, Shaoguang']","['Peng C', 'Chen Y', 'Yang Z', 'Zhang H', 'Osterby L', 'Rosmarin AG', 'Li S']","['Division of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Medicine, University of Massachusetts Medical School, Worcester, MA, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20091118,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'EC 3.1.3.67 (PTEN Phosphohydrolase)', 'EC 3.1.3.67 (Pten protein, mouse)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/genetics', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Disease Progression', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/genetics/physiology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*genetics/metabolism/mortality/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*metabolism/pathology', 'PTEN Phosphohydrolase/genetics/metabolism/*physiology', 'Survival Analysis', 'Transplantation, Heterologous', '*Tumor Suppressor Proteins/genetics/metabolism/physiology', 'Up-Regulation/physiology']",2009/12/08 06:00,2010/02/24 06:00,['2009/12/08 06:00'],"['2009/12/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/12/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/02/24 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)49322-X [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2009-06-228130 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2010 Jan 21;115(3):626-35. doi: 10.1182/blood-2009-06-228130.

Using an interim safety analysis of the randomized German CML Study IV designed to optimize imatinib therapy by combination, dose escalation, and transplantation, we here report on 84 patients who underwent consecutive transplantation according to predefined criteria (low European Group for Blood and Marrow Transplantation [EBMT] score, imatinib failure, and advanced disease). Three-year survival after transplantation of 56 patients in chronic phase was 91% (median follow-up: 30 months). Transplantation-related mortality was 8%. In a matched pair comparison of patients who received a transplant and those who did not, survival was not different. Three-year survival after transplantation of 28 patients in advanced phase was 59%. Eighty-eight percent of patients who received a transplant achieved complete molecular remissions.

Using the murine bone-marrow retroviral transduction/transformation assay, we showed that R1A-RARalpha fusion protein could transform bone-marrow progenitor/stem cells. In gel-shift assays, R1A-RARalpha was able to bind to a panel of retinoic acid response elements both as a homodimer and as a heterodimer with RXRalpha, and demonstrated distinct DNA-binding characteristics compared with wild-type RARalpha/RXRalpha or other X-RARalpha chimeric proteins. The ratio of R1A-RARalpha to RXRalpha proteins affected the retinoic acid response element interaction pattern of R1A-RARalpha/RXRalpha complexes. Studies comparing R1A-RARalpha with R1A-RARalpha(DeltaRIIa) demonstrated that the RIIa protein interaction domain located within R1A was responsible for R1A-RARalpha homodimeric DNA binding and interaction with wild-type R1A protein. However, the RIIa domain was not required for R1A-RARalpha-mediated transformation because its deletion in R1A-RARalpha(DeltaRIIa) did not compromise its transformation capability. In contrast, introduction of point mutations within the RARalpha portion of either R1A-RARalpha or R1A-RARalpha(DeltaRIIa), previously demonstrated to eliminate RXRalpha interaction or treatment of transduced cells with RXRalpha shRNA or a RXRalpha agonist, reduced transformation capability. Thus, leukemic transformation by APL fusion protein PRKAR1A-RARalpha is critically dependent on RXRalpha, which suggests RXRalpha is a promising target for APL.","['Qiu, Jihui J', 'Lu, Xiaoxi', 'Zeisig, Bernd B', 'Ma, Zhigui', 'Cai, Xun', 'Chen, Saijuan', 'Gronemeyer, Hinrich', 'Tweardy, David J', 'So, Chi Wai Eric', 'Dong, Shuo']","['Qiu JJ', 'Lu X', 'Zeisig BB', 'Ma Z', 'Cai X', 'Chen S', 'Gronemeyer H', 'Tweardy DJ', 'So CW', 'Dong S']","['Department of Medicine, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20091117,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Cyclic AMP-Dependent Protein Kinase RIalpha Subunit)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (PRKAR1A protein, human)', '0 (RARA protein, human)', '0 (Rara protein, mouse)', '0 (Receptors, Retinoic Acid)', '0 (Retinoic Acid Receptor alpha)', '0 (Retinoid X Receptor alpha)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/genetics/*metabolism', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cyclic AMP-Dependent Protein Kinase RIalpha Subunit/genetics/*metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'HeLa Cells', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/pathology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/genetics/metabolism', 'Protein Binding/physiology', 'Receptors, Retinoic Acid/genetics/*metabolism', 'Retinoic Acid Receptor alpha', 'Retinoid X Receptor alpha/*metabolism/physiology']",2009/12/08 06:00,2010/02/24 06:00,['2009/12/08 06:00'],"['2009/12/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/12/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/02/24 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)49324-3 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2009-07-232652 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2010 Jan 21;115(3):643-52. doi: 10.1182/blood-2009-07-232652.

ABL-specific tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), whilst effective against mature CML cells, induce little apoptosis in stem/progenitor cells. However, in stem/progenitor cells TKIs exert potent anti-proliferative effects through a poorly understood mechanism. We showed that in CD34(+) CML cells FOXO1, 3a and 4 (FOXOs) were phosphorylated, predominantly cytoplasmic and inactive, consequent to BCR-ABL expression. TKIs decreased phosphorylation of FOXOs, leading to their re-localisation from cytoplasm (inactive) to nucleus (active), thus inducing G1 arrest. Of key importance, despite BCR-ABL activity, primitive quiescent CML stem cells showed low levels of FOXO phosphorylation and predominant nuclear localisation, resembling the pattern in normal stem cells. These results demonstrate for the first time that TKI-induced G1 arrest in CML progenitor cells is mediated by re-activation of FOXOs, whilst quiescence of CML stem cells is regulated by sustained FOXO activity. These data contribute to our understanding of CML stem cell quiescence and TKI activity, suggesting new strategies to target CML stem/progenitor cells by preventing or reversing this effect.","['Pellicano, Francesca', 'Cilloni, Daniela', 'Helgason, G Vignir', 'Messa, Francesca', 'Panuzzo, Cristina', 'Arruga, Francesca', 'Bracco, Enrico', 'Allan, Elaine', 'Huntly, Brian J P', 'Holyoake, Tessa L', 'Saglio, Giuseppe']","['Pellicano F', 'Cilloni D', 'Helgason GV', 'Messa F', 'Panuzzo C', 'Arruga F', 'Bracco E', 'Allan E', 'Huntly BJ', 'Holyoake TL', 'Saglio G']","[""Paul O'Gorman Leukaemia Research Centre, Medical Faculty, University of Glasgow, Glasgow, UK.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Retracted Publication']",20091201,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,,,,2009/12/08 06:00,2009/12/08 06:01,['2009/12/08 06:00'],"['2009/12/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/12/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2009/12/08 06:01 [medline]']","['blood-2009-06-226621 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2009-06-226621 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2009 Dec 1. pii: blood-2009-06-226621. doi: 10.1182/blood-2009-06-226621.

However, oxidase correction per marked neutrophil was less than normal and not sustained. Despite this, patients clearly benefited in that severe infections resolved. As such, we initiated a gene therapy trial for X-CGD to treat severe infections unresponsive to conventional therapy. We treated 3 adult patients using busulfan conditioning and an MFGS retroviral vector encoding gp91(phox), achieving early marking of 26%, 5%, and 4% of neutrophils, respectively, with sustained long-term marking of 1.1% and 0.03% of neutrophils in 2 of the patients.

XmAb5574 is a novel engineered anti-CD19 monoclonal antibody with a modified constant fragment (Fc)-domain designed to enhance binding of FcgammaRIIIa. Herein, we demonstrate that XmAb5574 mediates potent antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC), modest direct cytotoxicity, and antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis but not complement-mediated cytotoxicity against CLL cells. Interestingly, XmAb5574 mediates significantly higher ADCC compared with both the humanized anti-CD19 nonengineered antibody it is derived from and also rituximab, a therapeutic antibody widely used in the treatment of CLL. The XmAb5574-dependent ADCC is mediated by natural killer (NK) cells through a granzyme B-dependent mechanism. The NK cell-mediated cytolytic and secretory function with XmAb5574 compared with the nonengineered antibody is associated with enhanced NK-cell activation, interferon production, extracellular signal-regulated kinase phosphorylation downstream of Fcgamma receptor, and no increased NK-cell apoptosis. Notably, enhanced NK cell-mediated ADCC with XmAb5574 was enhanced further by lenalidomide. These findings provide strong support for further clinical development of XmAb5574 as both a monotherapy and in combination with lenalidomide for the therapy of CLL and related CD19(+) B-cell malignancies.","['Awan, Farrukh T', 'Lapalombella, Rosa', 'Trotta, Rossana', 'Butchar, Jonathan P', 'Yu, Bo', 'Benson, Don M Jr', 'Roda, Julie M', 'Cheney, Carolyn', 'Mo, Xiaokui', 'Lehman, Amy', 'Jones, Jeffrey', 'Flynn, Joseph', 'Jarjoura, David', 'Desjarlais, John R', 'Tridandapani, Susheela', 'Caligiuri, Michael A', 'Muthusamy, Natarajan', 'Byrd, John C']","['Awan FT', 'Lapalombella R', 'Trotta R', 'Butchar JP', 'Yu B', 'Benson DM Jr', 'Roda JM', 'Cheney C', 'Mo X', 'Lehman A', 'Jones J', 'Flynn J', 'Jarjoura D', 'Desjarlais JR', 'Tridandapani S', 'Caligiuri MA', 'Muthusamy N', 'Byrd JC']","['Division of Hematology-Oncology, Department of Medicine, College of Medicine, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20091202,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, CD19)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Fc Fragments)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases)', 'EC 3.4.21.- (Granzymes)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/*therapeutic use', 'Antibody-Dependent Cell Cytotoxicity/*physiology', 'Antigens, CD19/*immunology', 'Apoptosis', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic/immunology', 'Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases/metabolism', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Granzymes/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Fc Fragments/*genetics/immunology', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*immunology', 'Leukemia, B-Cell/genetics/immunology/therapy', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/genetics/immunology/*therapy', 'Phagocytosis', 'Phosphorylation', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction']",2009/12/08 06:00,2010/03/20 06:00,['2009/12/08 06:00'],"['2009/12/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/12/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/03/20 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)49252-3 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2009-06-229039 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2010 Feb 11;115(6):1204-13. doi: 10.1182/blood-2009-06-229039.

Our knowledge of their cellular functions comes mostly from previous biochemical studies that used mutant overexpression approaches in various clonal cell lines. Recent progress in understanding Rho GTPase functions in blood cell development and regulation by gene targeting of individual Rho GTPases in mice has allowed a genetic understanding of their physiologic roles in hematopoietic progenitors and mature lineages. In particular, mouse gene-targeting studies have provided convincing evidence that individual members of the Rho GTPase family are essential regulators of cell type-specific functions and stimuli-specific pathways in regulating hematopoietic stem cell interaction with bone marrow niche, erythropoiesis, and red blood cell actin dynamics, phagocyte migration and killing, and T- and B-cell maturation. In addition, deregulation of Rho GTPase family members has been associated with multiple human hematologic diseases such as neutrophil dysfunction, leukemia, and Fanconi anemia, raising the possibility that Rho GTPases and downstream signaling pathways are of therapeutic value. In this review we discuss recent genetic studies of Rho GTPases in hematopoiesis and several blood lineages and the implications of Rho GTPase signaling in hematologic malignancies, immune pathology. and anemia.","['Mulloy, James C', 'Cancelas, Jose A', 'Filippi, Marie-Dominique', 'Kalfa, Theodosia A', 'Guo, Fukun', 'Zheng, Yi']","['Mulloy JC', 'Cancelas JA', 'Filippi MD', 'Kalfa TA', 'Guo F', 'Zheng Y']","[""Division of Experimental Hematology and Cancer Biology, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, University of Cincinnati College of Medicine, OH 45229, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', 'Review']",20091124,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (GTPase-Activating Proteins)', '0 (Guanine Nucleotide Exchange Factors)', '146-91-8 (Guanosine Diphosphate)', '86-01-1 (Guanosine Triphosphate)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (rho GTP-Binding Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'GTPase-Activating Proteins/metabolism', 'Guanine Nucleotide Exchange Factors/metabolism', 'Guanosine Diphosphate/metabolism', 'Guanosine Triphosphate/metabolism', 'Hematologic Diseases/*metabolism/pathology', '*Hematopoiesis', 'Humans', 'Models, Biological', 'rho GTP-Binding Proteins/*metabolism']",2009/12/08 06:00,2010/03/06 06:00,['2009/12/08 06:00'],"['2009/12/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/12/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/03/06 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)37473-5 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2009-09-198127 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2010 Feb 4;115(5):936-47. doi: 10.1182/blood-2009-09-198127.

CD154 gene therapy can reverse this immune defect, but attempts to do this pharmacologically have been unsuccessful. The immune-modulatory agent lenalidomide shows clinical activity in CLL, but its mechanism is poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate that lenalidomide induces expression of functional CD154 antigen on CLL cells both in vitro and in vivo. This occurs via enhanced CD154 transcription mediated by a Nuclear Factor of Activated T cells c1 (NFATc1)/Nuclear Factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) complex and also through phosphoinositide-3 (PI3)-kinase pathway-dependent stabilization of CD154 mRNA. Importantly, CD154-positive CLL cells up-regulate BID, DR5, and p73, become sensitized to tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL)-mediated apoptosis, and promote costimulatory activation of normal B cells to produce antibodies. In CLL patients receiving lenalidomide, similar evidence of CD154 activation is observed including BID, DR5, and p73 induction and also development of anti-ROR1 tumor-directed antibodies. Our data demonstrate that lenalidomide promotes CD154 expression on CLL cells with subsequent activation phenotype, and may therefore reverse the humoral immune defect observed in this disease.

We find that by gene expression DS-ALL is a highly heterogeneous disease not definable as a unique entity. Nevertheless, 62% (33/53) of the DS-ALL samples analyzed were characterized by high expression of the type I cytokine receptor CRLF2 caused by either immunoglobulin heavy locus (IgH@) translocations or by interstitial deletions creating chimeric transcripts P2RY8-CRLF2. In 3 of these 33 patients, a novel activating somatic mutation, F232C in CRLF2, was identified. Consistent with our previous research, mutations in R683 of JAK2 were identified in 10 specimens (19% of the patients) and, interestingly, all 10 had high CRLF2 expression. Cytokine receptor-like factor 2 (CRLF2) and mutated Janus kinase 2 (Jak2) cooperated in conferring cytokine-independent growth to BaF3 pro-B cells. Intriguingly, the gene expression signature of DS-ALL is enriched with DNA damage and BCL6 responsive genes, suggesting the possibility of B-cell lymphocytic genomic instability. Thus, DS confers increased risk for genetically highly diverse ALLs with frequent overexpression of CRLF2, associated with activating mutations in the receptor itself or in JAK2.

Because response to prednisone largely determines clinical outcome of pediatric patients with ALL, overcoming resistance to this drug may be an important step toward improving prognosis. Here, we show how gene expression profiling identifies high-level MCL-1 expression to be associated with prednisolone resistance in MLL-rearranged infant ALL, as well as in more favorable types of childhood ALL. To validate this observation, we determined MCL-1 expression with quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction in a cohort of MLL-rearranged infant ALL and pediatric noninfant ALL samples and confirmed that high-level MCL-1 expression is associated with prednisolone resistance in vitro. In addition, MCL-1 expression appeared to be significantly higher in MLL-rearranged infant patients who showed a poor response to prednisone in vivo compared with prednisone good responders. Finally, down-regulation of MCL-1 in prednisolone-resistant MLL-rearranged leukemia cells by RNA interference, to some extent, led to prednisolone sensitization. Collectively, our findings suggest a potential role for MCL-1 in glucocorticoid resistance in MLL-rearranged infant ALL, but at the same time strongly imply that high-level MCL-1 expression is not the sole mechanism providing resistance to these drugs.","['Stam, Ronald W', 'Den Boer, Monique L', 'Schneider, Pauline', 'de Boer, Jasper', 'Hagelstein, Jill', 'Valsecchi, Maria G', 'de Lorenzo, Paola', 'Sallan, Stephen E', 'Brady, Hugh J M', 'Armstrong, Scott A', 'Pieters, Rob']","['Stam RW', 'Den Boer ML', 'Schneider P', 'de Boer J', 'Hagelstein J', 'Valsecchi MG', 'de Lorenzo P', 'Sallan SE', 'Brady HJ', 'Armstrong SA', 'Pieters R']","[""Department of Pediatric Oncology/Hematology, Erasmus Medical Center-Sophia Children's Hospital, Rotterdam, The Netherlands. r.stam@erasmusmc.nl""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20091204,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Glucocorticoids)', '0 (KMT2A protein, human)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)', 'VB0R961HZT (Prednisone)']",IM,"['Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Child', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*genetics', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Gene Rearrangement', 'Glucocorticoids/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase', 'Humans', 'Immunoblotting', 'Infant', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/*genetics/metabolism', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/*genetics/pathology', 'Prednisone/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*genetics/metabolism', 'RNA Interference', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction']",2009/12/08 06:00,2010/03/06 06:00,['2009/12/08 06:00'],"['2009/12/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/12/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/03/06 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)37481-4 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2009-02-205963 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2010 Feb 4;115(5):1018-25. doi: 10.1182/blood-2009-02-205963.

We investigated ferrochelatase expression in iron-deficient erythropoietic tissues of mice lacking iron regulatory protein 2, in iron-deficient murine erythroleukemia cells, and in human patients with ISCU myopathy. Ferrochelatase activity and protein levels were dramatically decreased in Irp2(-/-) spleens, whereas ferrochelatase mRNA levels were increased, demonstrating posttranscriptional regulation of ferrochelatase in vivo. Translation of ferrochelatase mRNA was unchanged in iron-depleted murine erythroleukemia cells, and the stability of mature ferrochelatase protein was also unaffected. However, the stability of newly formed ferrochelatase protein was dramatically decreased during iron deficiency. Ferrochelatase was also severely depleted in muscle biopsies and cultured myoblasts from patients with ISCU myopathy, a disease caused by deficiency of a scaffold protein required for Fe-S cluster assembly. Together, these data suggest that decreased Fe-S cluster availability because of cellular iron depletion or impaired Fe-S cluster assembly causes reduced maturation and stabilization of apo-ferrochelatase, providing a direct link between Fe-S biogenesis and completion of heme biosynthesis. We propose that decreased heme biosynthesis resulting from impaired Fe-S cluster assembly can contribute to the pathogenesis of diseases caused by defective Fe-S cluster biogenesis.","['Crooks, Daniel R', 'Ghosh, Manik C', 'Haller, Ronald G', 'Tong, Wing-Hang', 'Rouault, Tracey A']","['Crooks DR', 'Ghosh MC', 'Haller RG', 'Tong WH', 'Rouault TA']","['Department of Biochemistry, Molecular and Cellular Biology, Georgetown University Medical Center, Washington, DC, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",20091125,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (RNA, Messenger)', '42VZT0U6YR (Heme)', '70FD1KFU70 (Sulfur)', 'E1UOL152H7 (Iron)', 'EC 4.2.1.3 (Iron Regulatory Protein 2)', 'EC 4.99.1.1 (Ferrochelatase)']",IM,"['Anemia, Iron-Deficiency/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Animals', 'Biopsy', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Erythrocytes/cytology/enzymology', 'Ferrochelatase/genetics/*metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic', 'Heme/*biosynthesis', 'Humans', 'Iron/*metabolism', 'Iron Regulatory Protein 2/genetics', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Mutant Strains', 'Mitochondrial Myopathies/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Muscle, Skeletal/enzymology/pathology', 'Oxidative Stress/physiology', 'Protein Processing, Post-Translational', 'RNA Processing, Post-Transcriptional', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Sulfur/*metabolism']",2009/12/08 06:00,2010/03/13 06:00,['2009/12/08 06:00'],"['2009/12/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/12/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/03/13 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)49285-7 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2009-09-243105 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2010 Jan 28;115(4):860-9. doi: 10.1182/blood-2009-09-243105.

We determined the methylation levels of 1320 CpG sites in regulatory regions of 416 genes in cells from 401 children diagnosed with ALL. Hierarchical clustering of 300 CpG sites distinguished between T-lineage ALL and B-cell precursor (BCP) ALL and between the main cytogenetic subtypes of BCP ALL. It also stratified patients with high hyperdiploidy and t(12;21) ALL into 2 subgroups with different probability of relapse. By using supervised learning, we constructed multivariate classifiers by external cross-validation procedures. We identified 40 genes that consistently contributed to accurate discrimination between the main subtypes of BCP ALL and gene sets that discriminated between subtypes of ALL and between ALL and controls in pairwise classification analyses. We also identified 20 individual genes with DNA methylation levels that predicted relapse of leukemia. Thus, methylation analysis should be explored as a method to improve stratification of ALL patients. The genes highlighted in our study are not enriched to specific pathways, but the gene expression levels are inversely correlated to the methylation levels.","['Milani, Lili', 'Lundmark, Anders', 'Kiialainen, Anna', 'Nordlund, Jessica', 'Flaegstad, Trond', 'Forestier, Erik', 'Heyman, Mats', 'Jonmundsson, Gudmundur', 'Kanerva, Jukka', 'Schmiegelow, Kjeld', 'Soderhall, Stefan', 'Gustafsson, Mats G', 'Lonnerholm, Gudmar', 'Syvanen, Ann-Christine']","['Milani L', 'Lundmark A', 'Kiialainen A', 'Nordlund J', 'Flaegstad T', 'Forestier E', 'Heyman M', 'Jonmundsson G', 'Kanerva J', 'Schmiegelow K', 'Soderhall S', 'Gustafsson MG', 'Lonnerholm G', 'Syvanen AC']","['Molecular Medicine, Department of Medical Sciences, Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20091125,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'B-Lymphocytes/pathology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 12/genetics', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 21/genetics', '*CpG Islands', '*DNA Methylation', 'DNA, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Male', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/classification/*genetics/therapy', 'Prognosis', 'Treatment Outcome']",2009/12/08 06:00,2010/03/20 06:00,['2009/12/08 06:00'],"['2009/12/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/12/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/03/20 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)49253-5 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2009-04-214668 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2010 Feb 11;115(6):1214-25. doi: 10.1182/blood-2009-04-214668.

It leads to debilitating condition of the patient and necessitates an early therapeutic intervention. For diagnosis of ALL, a pathologist examines bone marrow smear for the count of different types of lymphoblasts to arrive at the diagnosis. The different counts of three different lymphoblasts can affect the type and intensity of the therapy to be used as well as the likely course of the disease. However, bone marrow smear examination and its interpretation is a tedious time consuming process. Therefore, any automation in terms of easing and pacing up the workflow is required. In this paper, we exactly do that by proposing an automatic method for recognition of different types of cells in ALL. The proposed algorithm mimics the pathological and ontological descriptions of bone marrow cells, in identifying abnormalities that lead to ALL. The proposed method uses discriminative shape, colour and texture features, which supposedly contains information for better discrimination of bone marrow cells. Further feature selection techniques, based on mutual information distribution and recursive feature elimination along with Relevance Vector Machines (RVM) are used for effective classification. The results are analyzed on more than 345 cell images. Sensitivity and specificity of above 93% has been achieved.","['Gupta, Lalit', 'Jayavanth, Sanjay', 'Ramaiah, Aruna']","['Gupta L', 'Jayavanth S', 'Ramaiah A']","['Philips Research Asia Bangalore, Philips Innovation Campus, Manyata Tech Park, Nagavara, Bangalore 560043, India. lalit.gupta@philips.com']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Annu Int Conf IEEE Eng Med Biol Soc,Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society.

An IGH@ rearrangement was found by FISH in 24 cases (16.0%). Of these 24 cases, 16 (67%) contained chromosomal abnormalities, including t(14;19)(q32;q13.2), t(8;14)(q24;q32), and t(14;18)(q32;q21). In addition, a cryptic deletion of the immunoglobulin heavy variable region (IGHV) was revealed. Using 30% as the cutoff for positive CD38 expression, 22 of the 24 cases (92%) were positive for CD38. The present results further confirm that IGH@ rearrangement is not a rare genomic abnormality in B-CLL, and also show both that t(14;19)(q32;q13.2) is the most common cytogenetic change involving IGH@ rearrangement detected by FISH in B-CLL and that IGH@ rearrangement is correlated with CD38 expression. It is appropriate to include an IGH@ probe in the FISH panel for B-CLL diagnosis.","['Lu, Gary', 'Kong, Yue', 'Yue, Changjun']","['Lu G', 'Kong Y', 'Yue C']","['Department of Hematopathology, Box 350, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, 1515 Holcombe Blvd., Houston, TX 77030, USA. gglu@mdanderson.org']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Cancer Genet Cytogenet,Cancer genetics and cytogenetics,7909240,['0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)'],IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/*genetics/immunology', '*Immunophenotyping', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*genetics/*immunology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged']",2009/12/08 06:00,2009/12/18 06:00,['2009/12/08 06:00'],"['2009/06/25 00:00 [received]', '2009/08/26 00:00 [revised]', '2009/08/31 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/12/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/12/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2009/12/18 06:00 [medline]']","['S0165-4608(09)00490-7 [pii]', '10.1016/j.cancergencyto.2009.08.021 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Genet Cytogenet. 2010 Jan 1;196(1):56-63. doi: 10.1016/j.cancergencyto.2009.08.021.,196,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Characteristic genomic abnormalities provide clinically important prognostic information. Because karyotyping and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) are laborious techniques, we investigated the diagnostic efficacy of the more recently developed multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) technique. MLPA and interphase FISH data of 88 CLL patients were compared for loci encompassing the 13q14 region, chromosome 12, and the ATM (11q22) and TP53 (17p13) genes. We found a perfect correlation, provided that the abnormal clone was present in at least 10-20% of the cells. Because multiple loci and multiple probes per locus were included in the MLPA assay, additional abnormalities not covered by the FISH probes were detected. Furthermore, in 13 cases deletions partly covering the 13q14.3 locus were observed, including three deletions that remained undetected by FISH. All the deletions included the noncoding RNA locus DLEU1 (previously BCMS), which is considered to be the most likely CLL-associated candidate tumor suppressor gene within the 13q14 region. We conclude that MLPA serves as a comprehensive and reliable technique for the simultaneous identification of different clinically relevant and region-specific genomic aberrations in CLL.","['Stevens-Kroef, Marian', 'Simons, Annet', 'Gorissen, Hanneke', 'Feuth, Ton', 'Weghuis, Daniel Olde', 'Buijs, Arjan', 'Raymakers, Reinier', 'Geurts van Kessel, Ad']","['Stevens-Kroef M', 'Simons A', 'Gorissen H', 'Feuth T', 'Weghuis DO', 'Buijs A', 'Raymakers R', 'Geurts van Kessel A']","['Department of Human Genetics, Radboud University Nijmegen Medical Center, PO Box 9101, 6500 HB Nijmegen, The Netherlands. m.stevens@antrg.umcn.nl']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Cancer Genet Cytogenet,Cancer genetics and cytogenetics,7909240,"['0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (ATM protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)']",IM,"['Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated Proteins', 'Cell Cycle Proteins/genetics', '*Chromosome Aberrations', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 13', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*genetics', 'Ligase Chain Reaction', 'Prognosis', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/genetics', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/genetics', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/genetics']",2009/12/08 06:00,2009/12/16 06:00,['2009/12/08 06:00'],"['2009/05/05 00:00 [received]', '2009/06/17 00:00 [revised]', '2009/06/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/12/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/12/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2009/12/16 06:00 [medline]']","['S0165-4608(09)00336-7 [pii]', '10.1016/j.cancergencyto.2009.06.020 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Genet Cytogenet. 2009 Dec;195(2):97-104. doi: 10.1016/j.cancergencyto.2009.06.020.,195,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Using the established C2C12 murine myoblast cell line, we observed that LIF treatment did not significantly increase the rate at which myoblasts synthesise DNA under conditions which increased cell quantity by 73% above control, whilst the known mitogen fibroblast growth factor-2 significantly increased DNA synthesis under these conditions. Consequently, we examined the capacity of LIF to prevent apoptotic cell death. LIF treatment significantly reduced staurosporine-induced apoptotic DNA fragmentation by 37% compared to control and also reduced the proteolytic activation of caspase-3 by 40% compared to control. This effect of LIF was completely abolished by addition of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitor wortmannin, indicating that the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase signalling pathway, previously shown to be linked to LIF-dependent increases in cell number, is necessary in mediating the anti-apoptotic effects of LIF. LIF treatment was also associated with increased levels of Bcl-xL and XIAP transcripts compared to control. Therefore, we suggest that the role of LIF in skeletal muscle regeneration and myogenesis is that of a survival factor rather than a mitogen.","['Hunt, L C', 'Tudor, E M', 'White, J D']","['Hunt LC', 'Tudor EM', 'White JD']","['Faculty of Veterinary Science, University of Melbourne, Flemington Road, Parkville 3010, Australia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20091204,United States,Exp Cell Res,Experimental cell research,0373226,"['0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (X-Linked Inhibitor of Apoptosis Protein)', '0 (bcl-X Protein)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'H88EPA0A3N (Staurosporine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/*physiology', 'Caspase 3/metabolism', 'Cell Count', 'Cell Line', 'DNA/genetics/metabolism', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/metabolism', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mitosis/*physiology', 'Myoblasts/cytology/*physiology', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/*metabolism', 'Staurosporine/metabolism', 'X-Linked Inhibitor of Apoptosis Protein/metabolism', 'bcl-X Protein/metabolism']",2009/12/08 06:00,2010/03/31 06:00,['2009/12/08 06:00'],"['2009/09/18 00:00 [received]', '2009/11/22 00:00 [revised]', '2009/11/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/12/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/12/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/03/31 06:00 [medline]']","['S0014-4827(09)00521-7 [pii]', '10.1016/j.yexcr.2009.11.022 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Cell Res. 2010 Apr 1;316(6):1002-9. doi: 10.1016/j.yexcr.2009.11.022.

K562 cells treated with 5-CBI down-regulated the histone H4 gene and induced apoptosis efficiently. Global gene expression data revealed that a number of histone H4 genes were down-regulated by 5-CBI treatment.

By establishing a cellular model that mimics the relative frequency of authentic translocation events without proliferation selection, we report mechanisms of nuclear receptor-dependent tumor translocations. Intronic binding of liganded androgen receptor (AR) first juxtaposes translocation loci by triggering intra- and interchromosomal interactions. AR then promotes site-specific DNA double-stranded breaks (DSBs) at translocation loci by recruiting two types of enzymatic activities induced by genotoxic stress and liganded AR, including activation-induced cytidine deaminase and the LINE-1 repeat-encoded ORF2 endonuclease. These enzymes synergistically generate site-selective DSBs at juxtaposed translocation loci that are ligated by nonhomologous end joining pathway for specific translocations. Our data suggest that the confluence of two parallel pathways initiated by liganded nuclear receptor and genotoxic stress underlies nonrandom tumor translocations, which may function in many types of tumors and pathological processes.","['Lin, Chunru', 'Yang, Liuqing', 'Tanasa, Bogdan', 'Hutt, Kasey', 'Ju, Bong-gun', 'Ohgi, Kenny', 'Zhang, Jie', 'Rose, David W', 'Fu, Xiang-Dong', 'Glass, Christopher K', 'Rosenfeld, Michael G']","['Lin C', 'Yang L', 'Tanasa B', 'Hutt K', 'Ju BG', 'Ohgi K', 'Zhang J', 'Rose DW', 'Fu XD', 'Glass CK', 'Rosenfeld MG']","['Howard Hughes Medical Institute, University of California, San Diego School of Medicine, 9500 Gilman Drive, La Jolla, CA 92093-0648, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",,United States,Cell,Cell,0413066,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (ERG protein, human)', '0 (ETV1 protein, human)', '0 (Receptors, Androgen)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Transcriptional Regulator ERG)', 'EC 3.4.21.- (Serine Endopeptidases)', 'EC 3.4.21.- (TMPRSS2 protein, human)']",IM,"['Cell Line, Tumor', 'DNA Damage', 'DNA Repair', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Introns', 'Long Interspersed Nucleotide Elements', 'Male', 'Open Reading Frames', 'Prostatic Neoplasms/*genetics', 'Receptors, Androgen/*metabolism', 'Serine Endopeptidases/genetics/metabolism', 'Trans-Activators/genetics/metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/metabolism', '*Transcription, Genetic', 'Transcriptional Regulator ERG', '*Translocation, Genetic']",2009/12/08 06:00,2010/01/08 06:00,['2009/12/08 06:00'],"['2008/12/21 00:00 [received]', '2009/04/20 00:00 [revised]', '2009/11/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/12/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/12/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/01/08 06:00 [medline]']","['S0092-8674(09)01488-3 [pii]', '10.1016/j.cell.2009.11.030 [doi]']",ppublish,Cell. 2009 Dec 11;139(6):1069-83. doi: 10.1016/j.cell.2009.11.030.,139,"['R01 NS034934/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States', 'R37 DK039949-26/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'R37 DK039949/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'KG080247/PHS HHS/United States', 'DK18477/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA097134-07/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 NS034934-19/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States', 'CA97134/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL065445-10/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'NS34934/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL065445/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'DK39949/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA097134/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'HHMI/Howard Hughes Medical Institute/United States']",['Cell. 2009 Dec 11;139(6):1047-9.

Distinct models to predict NK cell alloreactivity differ in their incorporation of information from typing of recipient and donor KIR and HLA gene loci, which exist on different autosomes and are inherited independently as haplotypes. Individuals may differ in the inheritance of the 2 KIR haplotypes, A and B, or in the expression of individual KIR genes. Here, we examined the effect of KIR and HLA genotype, in both the recipient and donor, on the outcome of 86 patients with advanced hematologic malignancies who received nonmyeloablative (NMA), HLA-haploidentical HSCT with high-dose, posttransplantation cyclophosphamide (Cy). Compared to recipients of bone marrow (BM) from donors with identical KIR gene content, recipients of inhibitory KIR (iKIR) gene-mismatched BM had an improved overall survival (OS) (hazard ratio [HR]=0.37; confidence interval [CI]: 0.21-0.63; P=.0003), event-free survival (EFS) (HR=0.51; CI: 0.31-0.84; P=.01), and relapse rate (cause-specific HR, SDHR=0.53; CI: 0.31-0.93; P=.025). Patients homozygous for the KIR ""A"" haplotype, which encodes only 1 activating KIR, had an improved OS (HR=0.30; CI: 0.13-10.69; P=.004), EFS (HR=0.47; CI: 0.22-1.00; P=.05), and nonrelapse mortality (NRM; cause-specific HR=0.13; CI: 0.017-0.968; P=.046) if their donor expressed at least 1 KIR B haplotype that encodes several activating KIRs. Models that incorporated information from recipient HLA typing, with or without donor HLA typing, were not predictive of outcome in this patient cohort. Thus, NMA conditioning and T cell-replete, HLA-haploidentical HSCTs involving iKIR gene mismatches between donor and recipient, or KIR haplotype AA recipients of BM from KIR Bx donors, were associated with lower relapse and NRM and improved OS and EFS. These findings suggest that selection of donors based upon inhibitory KIR gene or haplotype incompatibility may be warranted.","['Symons, Heather J', 'Leffell, M Sue', 'Rossiter, Nancy D', 'Zahurak, Marianna', 'Jones, Richard J', 'Fuchs, Ephraim J']","['Symons HJ', 'Leffell MS', 'Rossiter ND', 'Zahurak M', 'Jones RJ', 'Fuchs EJ']","['Department of Oncology, Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center at Johns Hopkins University,1650 Orleans Street, Baltimore, MD 21231, USA. hsymons2@jhmi.edu']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial, Phase I', 'Clinical Trial, Phase II', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20091202,United States,Biol Blood Marrow Transplant,Biology of blood and marrow transplantation : journal of the American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation,9600628,"['0 (HLA Antigens)', '0 (Receptors, KIR)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/immunology/*methods', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'HLA Antigens/genetics/immunology', 'Haplotypes', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/genetics/immunology/*therapy', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*immunology/transplantation', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Receptors, KIR/*genetics/immunology', 'Survival Analysis', 'Transplantation Conditioning', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Young Adult']",2009/12/08 06:00,2010/09/29 06:00,['2009/12/08 06:00'],"['2009/08/22 00:00 [received]', '2009/11/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/12/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/12/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/09/29 06:00 [medline]']","['S1083-8791(09)00582-5 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bbmt.2009.11.022 [doi]']",ppublish,Biol Blood Marrow Transplant. 2010 Apr;16(4):533-42. doi: 10.1016/j.bbmt.2009.11.022.

However, only recently has it been acknowledged that positive outcomes including post-traumatic growth or benefit finding may also occur. The aim of our study was to extend previous work describing benefit finding among survivors of childhood cancer, by determining the contribution of demographic and medical variables and associations between child benefit finding and parent post-traumatic growth. METHODS: Survivors of any child cancer (leukaemia, central nervous system or solid tumour; age 12-15 years; completed treatment >2 years) were recruited from routine follow-up clinics and asked to complete questionnaires [Benefit Finding Scale for Children (BFSC), quality of life (QOL), post-traumatic stress (PTS), illness perception and optimism]. Parents completed parallel measures to describe their own post-traumatic growth (PTG), QOL, PTS and illness perception. RESULTS: Forty-eight survivors and parents completed questionnaires (response rate: 81%). The BFSC showed good internal reliability (alpha = 0.91). Diagnosis of leukaemia, greater optimism and reports that the illness still affects their life today were associated with higher scores on the BFSC among survivors themselves. For parents, perceptions of how much the illness still affects them emotionally was associated with PTG. There was no association between children's benefit finding and parents' PTG. CONCLUSIONS: The BFSC is a useful and reliable instrument to assess positive outcomes after cancer in children.

CLL without somatic hypermutation has an adverse outcome, but the precise biological differences that underlie this more aggressive clinical-course are unclear. Using a proteomic approach, we found that the two prognostic forms of CLL were consistently distinguished according to their protein expression pattern. The most important difference observed related to the different expression of nucleophosmin 1 between the two forms of CLL. This different expression was not related to apoptosis, proliferation or gene mutation. However, co-immunoprecipitation experiments identified an association between nucleophosmin 1 and ribosomal proteins. Using immunocytofluorescence, nucleophosmin 1 expression was identified in the nucleoli and nucleoplasm of all cells, but in a proportion of cells, nucleophosmin had been transferred from the nucleoplasm to the cytoplasm. Both the fluorescent intensity, and the frequency of cytoplasmic nucleophosmin 1 expression, was higher in CLL without somatic hypermutation. We propose therefore, that nucleophosmin 1, in association with ribosomal proteins, undergoes nucleo-cytoplasmic shuttling in CLL. This process is most prominent in un-mutated CLL and may signify altered protein biosynthesis.","['Rees-Unwin, Karen S', 'Faragher, Robin', 'Unwin, Richard D', 'Adams, Julie', 'Brown, Philip J', 'Buckle, Ann-Marie', 'Pettitt, Andrew', 'Hutchinson, Claire V', 'Johnson, Suzanne M', 'Pulford, Karen', 'Banham, Alison H', 'Whetton, Anthony D', 'Lucas, Guy', 'Mason, David Y', 'Burthem, John']","['Rees-Unwin KS', 'Faragher R', 'Unwin RD', 'Adams J', 'Brown PJ', 'Buckle AM', 'Pettitt A', 'Hutchinson CV', 'Johnson SM', 'Pulford K', 'Banham AH', 'Whetton AD', 'Lucas G', 'Mason DY', 'Burthem J']","['School of Cancer & Imaging Sciences, Faculty of Medical & Human Sciences, The University of Manchester, Manchester Academic Health Science Centre, Oxford Road, Manchester, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20091123,England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (NPM1 protein, human)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '117896-08-9 (Nucleophosmin)']",IM,"['Biomarkers, Tumor/*metabolism', 'Cell Nucleus/metabolism', 'Cytoplasm/metabolism', 'DNA Mutational Analysis/methods', 'DNA, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/diagnosis/genetics/*metabolism', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Nuclear Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Nucleophosmin', 'Prognosis', 'Somatic Hypermutation, Immunoglobulin', 'Up-Regulation']",2009/12/08 06:00,2010/06/30 06:00,['2009/12/08 06:00'],"['2009/12/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/12/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/06/30 06:00 [medline]']","['BJH7979 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1365-2141.2009.07979.x [doi]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2010 Feb;148(4):534-43. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.2009.07979.x.

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: In the observational 'Unmet Needs in CML' (UNIC) study of CML management in Europe, case report forms were completed retrospectively for eligible patients (> or =18 years of age, currently treated for CML) during enrolment (September 2006-March 2007). Results from the subset of patients from France are presented. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Primary objectives were to estimate from the collected data the proportions of patients ever treated with imatinib and those experiencing imatinib resistance and/or intolerance as determined by physicians' diagnoses of resistance/intolerance leading to a change in imatinib use. Collected data were analysed descriptively. Secondary descriptive measures included imatinib dose modifications and methods for treatment response monitoring. RESULTS: Of the 654 French CP-CML patients, 95.9% had received imatinib. Of these, 15% were judged by physicians as imatinib-resistant and 31% as imatinib-intolerant (not mutually exclusive) during treatment, 44% required dose modification and 23% discontinued imatinib. In the 12 months preceding the last observation, 65% had a cytogenetic features analysis and 93% had a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assessment of molecular response. Importantly, and contrasting with European recommendations, 46% of imatinib-resistant patients had never been assessed for BCR-ABL mutations. LIMITATIONS: The observational study design limits data collection and interpretation. The findings are specific to the French healthcare system and may not apply to other countries. CONCLUSION: This observational study of CP-CML management in France confirmed that most patients are treated with imatinib, a treatment widely recognised as efficacious. The study highlights opportunities for optimising CML management, as a proportion of patients may require alternative treatment strategies due to imatinib resistance/intolerance. Response monitoring rates differ from recommendations, representing another opportunity for improving care for CP-CML patients through early identification of patients failing current therapy.","['Michallet, Mauricette', 'Tulliez, Michel', 'Corm, Selim', 'Gardembas, Martine', 'Huguet, Francoise', 'Oukessou, Abderrahim', 'Bregman, Bruno', 'Vekhoff, Anne', 'Ghomari, Kamel', 'Cambier, Nathalie', 'Guerci-Bresler, Agnes']","['Michallet M', 'Tulliez M', 'Corm S', 'Gardembas M', 'Huguet F', 'Oukessou A', 'Bregman B', 'Vekhoff A', 'Ghomari K', 'Cambier N', 'Guerci-Bresler A']","['Hospices Civils de Lyon, 5 pl Arsonval, Lyon 69437, France. mauricette.michallet@chu-lyon.fr']",['eng'],"['Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Curr Med Res Opin,Current medical research and opinion,0351014,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Algorithms', 'Female', 'France', '*Health Services Needs and Demand/statistics & numerical data', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Professional Practice/statistics & numerical data', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Young Adult']",2009/12/08 06:00,2010/05/01 06:00,['2009/12/08 06:00'],"['2009/12/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/12/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/05/01 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1185/03007990903479299 [doi]'],ppublish,Curr Med Res Opin. 2010 Feb;26(2):307-17. doi: 10.1185/03007990903479299.,26,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The assumption is often made that traumatic and sudden deaths have minimal risk of unsuspected neoplasia. An autopsy of a registered tissue donor with strong preautopsy clinical assessment of a saddle pulmonary embolus revealed unsuspected acute lymphoblastic leukemia, prompting a review of the incidence of unsuspected neoplasia from a regional forensic autopsy practice. OBJECTIVE: -To determine the incidence of (1) unsuspected neoplasia, (2) clinical concordance of known neoplasia, and (3) potential donor referral in a regional forensic autopsy service. DESIGN: -A retrospective, 5-year review of 412 autopsies from a regional, primarily forensic, autopsy service to determine the incidence of unsuspected neoplasia, clinical concordance of known neoplasia, and the preautopsy assessment of potential donor referral suitability. RESULTS: -Unsuspected neoplasia rate at autopsy was 7% (29 of 412 patients); cancer was the cause of death in 41% (12 of 29 patients) of these individuals. In patients with a history of cancer, the discordance of cancer diagnosis was 44% (4 of 9 patients [11 patients with known cancer, 2 who refused medical evaluation were excluded from the study]). Nearly 60% (17 of 29 patients) of the unsuspected cancer cases had no apparent reason for deferral of tissue procurement before the autopsy examination. CONCLUSIONS: -The 7% incidence of unsuspected cancer in a forensic autopsy practice raises concern for the potential introduction of neoplastic tissue in the donor pool. To ensure the safety of this vital resource, mandatory complete autopsies on deceased donors are advocated as well as a tissue-recipient registry to track donor-related neoplasia.","['Sens, Mary Ann', 'Zhou, XuDong', 'Weiland, Timothy', 'Cooley, A Marvin']","['Sens MA', 'Zhou X', 'Weiland T', 'Cooley AM']","['Department of Pathology, University of North Dakota School of Medicine and Health Sciences, Grand Forks, ND 58202-9037, USA. msens@medicine.nodak.edu']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",,United States,Arch Pathol Lab Med,Archives of pathology & laboratory medicine,7607091,,IM,"['Aged', 'Autopsy/methods/*statistics & numerical data', 'Cause of Death', 'Coroners and Medical Examiners', 'Death, Sudden', 'Fatal Outcome', 'Female', 'Forensic Pathology/methods/statistics & numerical data', 'Humans', 'Incidental Findings', 'Male', 'Mass Screening', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms/diagnosis/mortality', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/blood/*diagnosis', 'Retrospective Studies', '*Tissue Donors']",2009/12/08 06:00,2010/01/07 06:00,['2009/12/08 06:00'],"['2009/02/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/12/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/12/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/01/07 06:00 [medline]']","['2008-0365-OAR1 [pii]', '10.5858/133.12.1923 [doi]']",ppublish,Arch Pathol Lab Med. 2009 Dec;133(12):1923-31. doi: 10.5858/133.12.1923.,133,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Among them, intracellular vesicular compartments, such as the Golgi apparatus, the recycling endosomal compartment, or cytotoxic granules help to build the immunological synapse and ensure effector functions, such as polarized secretion of cytokines by helper T cells, or exocytosis of lytic granules by cytotoxic T cells. Lymphotropic retroviruses, such as the human immunodeficiency virus type 1, the human T cell leukemia virus type 1, or the Herpesvirus saimiri, can subvert some of the vesicle traffic mechanisms impeding the generation and function of the immunological synapses. This review focuses on the polarization of vesicle traffic, its regulation, and its role in maintaining the structure and function of the immunological synapse.

Target population These recommendations apply to adults with a newly diagnosed single brain metastasis amenable to surgical resection. Recommendations Surgical resection plus WBRT versus surgical resection alone Level 1 Surgical resection followed by WBRT represents a superior treatment modality, in terms of improving tumor control at the original site of the metastasis and in the brain overall, when compared to surgical resection alone. Surgical resection plus WBRT versus SRS +/- WBRT Level 2 Surgical resection plus WBRT, versus stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) plus WBRT, both represent effective treatment strategies, resulting in relatively equal survival rates. SRS has not been assessed from an evidence-based standpoint for larger lesions (>3 cm) or for those causing significant mass effect (>1 cm midline shift). Level 3 Underpowered class I evidence along with the preponderance of conflicting class II evidence suggests that SRS alone may provide equivalent functional and survival outcomes compared with resection + WBRT for patients with single brain metastases, so long as ready detection of distant site failure and salvage SRS are possible.

Given that the recommendation resulting from the systematic review of the literature on this topic is also highly relevant to the discussion of the role of surgical resection in the management of brain metastases, this recommendation has been included below. Question Does surgical resection in addition to WBRT improve outcomes when compared with WBRT alone? Target population This recommendation applies to adults with a newly diagnosed single brain metastasis amenable to surgical resection; however, the recommendation does not apply to relatively radiosensitive tumors histologies (i.e., small cell lung cancer, leukemia, lymphoma, germ cell tumors and multiple myeloma). Recommendation Surgical resection plus WBRT versus WBRT alone Level 1 Class I evidence supports the use of surgical resection plus post-operative WBRT, as compared to WBRT alone, in patients with good performance status (functionally independent and spending less than 50% of time in bed) and limited extra-cranial disease. There is insufficient evidence to make a recommendation for patients with poor performance scores, advanced systemic disease, or multiple brain metastases.","['Kalkanis, Steven N', 'Kondziolka, Douglas', 'Gaspar, Laurie E', 'Burri, Stuart H', 'Asher, Anthony L', 'Cobbs, Charles S', 'Ammirati, Mario', 'Robinson, Paula D', 'Andrews, David W', 'Loeffler, Jay S', 'McDermott, Michael', 'Mehta, Minesh P', 'Mikkelsen, Tom', 'Olson, Jeffrey J', 'Paleologos, Nina A', 'Patchell, Roy A', 'Ryken, Timothy C', 'Linskey, Mark E']","['Kalkanis SN', 'Kondziolka D', 'Gaspar LE', 'Burri SH', 'Asher AL', 'Cobbs CS', 'Ammirati M', 'Robinson PD', 'Andrews DW', 'Loeffler JS', 'McDermott M', 'Mehta MP', 'Mikkelsen T', 'Olson JJ', 'Paleologos NA', 'Patchell RA', 'Ryken TC', 'Linskey ME']","['Department of Neurosurgery, Henry Ford Health System, 2799 West Grand Blvd, K-11, Detroit, MI 48202, USA. kalkanis@neuro.hfh.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review', 'Systematic Review']",20091204,United States,J Neurooncol,Journal of neuro-oncology,8309335,,IM,"['Brain Neoplasms/*diagnosis/radiotherapy/secondary/*surgery', 'Evidence-Based Medicine', 'Humans', 'Neurosurgery/*methods/standards', 'Practice Guidelines as Topic', 'Radiotherapy, Adjuvant/methods']",2009/12/05 06:00,2010/03/25 06:00,['2009/12/05 06:00'],"['2009/09/07 00:00 [received]', '2009/11/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/12/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/12/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/03/25 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s11060-009-0061-8 [doi]'],ppublish,J Neurooncol. 2010 Jan;96(1):33-43. doi: 10.1007/s11060-009-0061-8.

In this study, we assessed serum levels of adiponectin in 69 patients with Binet stage A B-CLL, and these values were retrospectively correlated with bone marrow (BM) microvessel area and serum levels of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF-2), angiogenin, PECAM-1 (CD31), matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9), interleukin-8 (IL-8), syndecan-1, and the percentage of CD38(+) or ZAP-70(+) CLL cells. The positive correlation between serum levels of adiponectin and VEGF (P = .03) does not translate into an increase of the extent of BM angiogenesis (P = .404), FGF-2 (P = .348), angiogenin (P = .402), and CD31 (P = .248) serum concentrations. Accordingly, IL-8 (P = .175), syndecan-1 (P = .06), and MMP-9 (P = .144) circulating levels were not likely to reflect adiponectin concentration. Furthermore, patients with higher levels of adiponectin had a more favorable biological profile as defined by a lower number of both CD38(-) (r = -0.294; P = .02) and ZAP-70(+) (r = -0.285; P = .04). Finally, we evaluated the presence of adiponectin in B-CLL cells at gene expression level. RMA intensity values for adiponectin gene transcript denote a homogeneous low expression in B-CLL cells, whereas VEGF transcript was highly expressed with a degree of interpatient variability. Overall, these data seem to indicate that adiponectin could be involved as an antiangiogenic factor in B-CLL.","['Molica, Stefano', 'Digiesi, Giovanna', 'Vacca, Angelo', 'Mirabelli, Rosanna', 'Todoerti, Katia', 'Battaglia, Caterina', 'Morabito, Fortunato', 'Neri, Antonino', 'Ribatti, Domenico']","['Molica S', 'Digiesi G', 'Vacca A', 'Mirabelli R', 'Todoerti K', 'Battaglia C', 'Morabito F', 'Neri A', 'Ribatti D']","['Medical Oncology Unit, Department of Hematology-Oncology, Azienda Ospedaliera Pugliese-Ciaccio, 88100 Catanzaro, Italy.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20090827,United States,Adv Hematol,Advances in hematology,101504271,,,,2009/12/05 06:00,2009/12/05 06:01,['2009/12/05 06:00'],"['2009/05/18 00:00 [received]', '2009/05/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/12/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/12/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2009/12/05 06:01 [medline]']",['10.1155/2009/287974 [doi]'],ppublish,Adv Hematol. 2009;2009:287974. doi: 10.1155/2009/287974.

Drugs can induce almost the entire spectrum of hematologic disorders, affecting white cells, red cells, platelets, and the coagulation system. This paper aims to emphasize the broad range of drug-induced hematological syndromes and to highlight some of the newer drugs and syndromes. Methods. Medline literature on drug-induced hematologic syndromes was reviewed. Most reports and reviews focus on individual drugs or cytopenias. Results. Drug-induced syndromes include hemolytic anemias, methemoglobinemia, red cell aplasia, sideroblastic anemia, megaloblastic anemia, polycythemia, aplastic anemia, leukocytosis, neutropenia, eosinophilia, immune thrombocytopenia, microangiopathic syndromes, hypercoagulability, hypoprothrombinemia, circulating anticoagulants, myelodysplasia, and acute leukemia. Some of the classic drugs known to cause hematologic abnormalities have been replaced by newer drugs, including biologics, accompanied by their own syndromes and unintended side effects. Conclusions. Drugs can induce toxicities spanning many hematologic syndromes, mediated by a variety of mechanisms. Physicians need to be alert to the potential for iatrogenic drug-induced hematologic complications.","['Mintzer, David M', 'Billet, Shira N', 'Chmielewski, Lauren']","['Mintzer DM', 'Billet SN', 'Chmielewski L']","['Section of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Pennsylvania Hospital, Philadelphia, PA 19106, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20090707,United States,Adv Hematol,Advances in hematology,101504271,,,,2009/12/05 06:00,2009/12/05 06:01,['2009/12/05 06:00'],"['2008/11/10 00:00 [received]', '2009/05/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/12/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/12/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2009/12/05 06:01 [medline]']",['10.1155/2009/495863 [doi]'],ppublish,Adv Hematol. 2009;2009:495863. doi: 10.1155/2009/495863.

Intravenous alemtuzumab and fludarabine are effective in combination for the treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), but require hospital visits for intravenous injection. We performed a pilot study to assess the safety and efficacy of outpatient-based oral fludarabine with subcutaneous alemtuzumab (OFSA) for the treatment of relapsed/refractory CLL. Results. Depending on their response, patients were given two to six 28-day cycles of subcutaneous alemtuzumab 30 mg on days 1,3, and 5 and oral fludarabine 40 mg/m(2)/day for 5 days. Median patient age was 74. The lymphocyte counts of all five patients fell after the 1st cycle of treatment and reached normal/low levels on completion of 2 to 6 cycles of therapy. Platelet counts and hemoglobin were unaffected. All five patients achieved complete hematological remission, while two attained minimal residual disease negativity on 4-color flow cytometry. Conclusions. Our OFSA regimen was effective in elderly Asian patients with relapsed/refractory CLL, and it should be investigated further.","['Hwang, William Y K', 'Dearden, Claire', 'Loh, Yvonne S M', 'Linn, Yeh C', 'Tien, Sim L', 'Teoh, Gerrard K H', 'How, Gee F', 'Heng, Kee K', 'Goh, Yeow T', 'Lee, Lai H']","['Hwang WY', 'Dearden C', 'Loh YS', 'Linn YC', 'Tien SL', 'Teoh GK', 'How GF', 'Heng KK', 'Goh YT', 'Lee LH']","['Department of Hematology, Singapore General Hospital, Singapore 169608.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20080225,United States,Adv Hematol,Advances in hematology,101504271,,,,2009/12/05 06:00,2009/12/05 06:01,['2009/12/05 06:00'],"['2008/09/08 00:00 [received]', '2008/12/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/12/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/12/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2009/12/05 06:01 [medline]']",['10.1155/2009/547582 [doi]'],ppublish,Adv Hematol. 2009;2009:547582. doi: 10.1155/2009/547582.

Previous work from our laboratory demonstrated that a majority of patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and acute lymphoid leukemia (ALL) overexpress CREB in the bone marrow. To understand the role of CREB in leukemogenesis, we examined the biological effect of CREB overexpression on primary leukemia cells, leukemia cell lines, and CREB overexpressing transgenic mice. Our results demonstrated that CREB overexpression leads to an increase in cellular proliferation and survival. Furthermore, CREB transgenic mice develop a myeloproliferative disorder with aberrant myelopoiesis in both the bone marrow and spleen. Additional research from other groups has shown that the expression of the cAMP early inducible repressor (ICER), a CREB repressor, is also deregulated in leukemias. And, miR-34b, a microRNA that negative regulates CREB expression, is expressed at lower levels in myeloid leukemia cell lines compared to that of healthy bone marrow. Taken together, these data suggest that CREB plays a role in cellular transformation. The data also suggest that CREB-specific signaling pathways could possibly serve as potential targets for therapeutic intervention.","['Sandoval, Salemiz', 'Pigazzi, Martina', 'Sakamoto, Kathleen M']","['Sandoval S', 'Pigazzi M', 'Sakamoto KM']","[""Division of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, Gwynne Hazen Cherry Memorial Laboratories, Mattel Children's Hospital, Jonsson Comprehensive Cancer Center, Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, David Geffen School of Medicine, Molecular Biology Institute, CA Nanosystems Institute, UCLA, Los Angeles, CA 90095, USA.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20090827,United States,Adv Hematol,Advances in hematology,101504271,,,,2009/12/05 06:00,2009/12/05 06:01,['2009/12/05 06:00'],"['2009/02/27 00:00 [received]', '2009/05/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/12/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/12/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2009/12/05 06:01 [medline]']",['10.1155/2009/634292 [doi]'],ppublish,Adv Hematol. 2009;2009:634292. doi: 10.1155/2009/634292.

No PI affected XMRV production; even high concentrations of Ritonavir failed to inhibit the maturation of XMRV Gag polyproteins. Among the NRTI, NNRTI and integrase inhibitors used in this study, only AZT blocked XMRV infection and replication through inhibition of viral reverse transcription. This sensitivity of XMRV to AZT may be explained by the modest homology in the motif D sequences of HIV-1 and XMRV reverse transcriptases.

Animal data suggest that imatinib at standard dosages is unlikely to impair fertility in either adult males or females but human data remain limited. Children born to men who are actively taking imatinib at the time of conception appear healthy and current advice is not to discontinue treatment. In contrast the data relating to children born to women exposed to imatinib during pregnancy are less encouraging. Although numbers are small there has been a disturbing cluster of rare congenital malformations such that imatinib cannot be safely recommended, particularly during the period of organogenesis. The appropriate management of children with CML has also been radically changed by the advent of imatinib. The features of the disease at presentation, the natural history and the response to therapy seem to be identical in children to that seen in adults. Now that imatinib has been in clinical use for almost ten years without severe long-term side effects, most physicians are now comfortable advising a trial of imatinib prior to consideration of transplant. Data relating to the efficacy and safety of second generation tyrosine kinase inhibitors in childhood is entirely absent and transplant remains the first choice for patients failing imatinib and perhaps also for young patients with sub-optimal responses.","['Apperley, Jane']",['Apperley J'],"['Department of Haematology, Imperial College, Hammersmith Hospital, Ducane Road, London W120NN, UK. j.apperley@imperial.ac.uk']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",,Netherlands,Best Pract Res Clin Haematol,Best practice & research.

By GEP analysis, several down/up-expressed genes have been identified. Furthermore, by SNP array analysis, deletions of genes such as IKAROS, PAX5 and CDKN2A-CDKN2B were frequently identified. New therapeutic approaches with novel TKIs are now available. Dasatinib, nilotinib and bosutinib are now in clinical development.

These mutations affect amino acids involved in imatinib binding or in regulatory regions of the BCR-ABL kinase domain, resulting in decreased sensitivity to imatinib while retaining aberrant kinase activity. The early detection of BCR-ABL mutants during therapy may aid in risk stratification as well as molecular-based treatment decisions.

Patterns of second malignancy risk across the age spectrum can differ in terms of the types of second malignancies observed, magnitude of the risks, the latency period, associated risk factors, and modifying influences. Potential explanations for the varying risk patterns by age include differences in susceptibility of individual tissue/organ to carcinogenesis based on stage of development and level of tissue maturity, microenvironment, attained age, and lifestyle factors. A thorough understanding of these differences is essential when considering treatment modifications in newly diagnosed cancer patients who are aimed at reducing the risk of second malignancy and other late effects without compromising cure. Moreover, an understanding of the variations in second cancer risk according to age at treatment is important in customizing patient follow-up.","['Ng, Andrea K', 'Kenney, Lisa B', 'Gilbert, Ethel S', 'Travis, Lois B']","['Ng AK', 'Kenney LB', 'Gilbert ES', 'Travis LB']","[""Department of Radiation Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA. ang@lroc.harvard.edu""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,Semin Radiat Oncol,Seminars in radiation oncology,9202882,,IM,"['Adult', 'Age Distribution', 'Aging', 'Breast Neoplasms/epidemiology/pathology/secondary', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Genital Neoplasms, Male/epidemiology/pathology/therapy', 'Hodgkin Disease/epidemiology/pathology/therapy', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Life Style', 'Lung Neoplasms/epidemiology/secondary/therapy', 'Male', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/*epidemiology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/epidemiology/pathology/therapy', 'Retinoblastoma/epidemiology/pathology/therapy', 'Risk Factors', 'Thyroid Neoplasms/epidemiology/secondary/therapy']",2009/12/05 06:00,2010/03/03 06:00,['2009/12/05 06:00'],"['2009/12/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/12/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/03/03 06:00 [medline]']","['S1053-4296(09)00067-8 [pii]', '10.1016/j.semradonc.2009.09.002 [doi]']",ppublish,Semin Radiat Oncol. 2010 Jan;20(1):67-78. doi: 10.1016/j.semradonc.2009.09.002.,20,['ZIA CP010131-17/ImNIH/Intramural NIH HHS/United States'],,PMC3857758,['NIHMS526934'],119,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This is the first population-based study of PTL in the United States. METHODS: PTL patients were identified in the SEER database. Bivariate (chi(2), Kaplan-Meier, and log rank) and multivariate (Cox proportional hazards) analyses were used to assess the associations between patient characteristics and survival. RESULTS: A total of 1,408 patients were identified over 32 years of follow-up (median, 3.75 years). Mean age was 66 years; 75% were female and 93% white. Overall, 98% had non-Hodgkin's lymphoma; 68% had diffuse large B-cell, 10% follicular, 10% marginal zone, and 3% small lymphocytic. A total of 88% had stage I-II disease. Median survival was 9.3 years. On bivariate analysis, older age, single marital status, stage II-IV disease, histology (large B-cell, follicular, or other non-Hodgkin's), earlier year of diagnosis, lack of prior malignancies, and no radiation/surgery predicted worse survival. Age >or=80 years, advanced stage, no radiation/surgery, and large B-cell or follicular histology predicted worse prognosis in multivariate analysis. CONCLUSION: Older age, advanced stage, histologic subtype, and lack of radiation/surgical treatment are associated with worse survival. Thyroid resection offers benefit only for patients with stage I disease. Management of PTL requires multidisciplinary collaboration.","['Graff-Baker, Amanda', 'Roman, Sanziana A', 'Thomas, Daniel C', 'Udelsman, Robert', 'Sosa, Julie Ann']","['Graff-Baker A', 'Roman SA', 'Thomas DC', 'Udelsman R', 'Sosa JA']","['Department of Surgery, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, CT 06520, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Surgery,Surgery,0417347,,IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/epidemiology/mortality/pathology', 'Lymphoma/*epidemiology/mortality/*pathology', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell, Marginal Zone/epidemiology/mortality/pathology', 'Lymphoma, Follicular/epidemiology/mortality/pathology', 'Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse/epidemiology/mortality/pathology', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/epidemiology/mortality/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Prognosis', 'Thyroid Neoplasms/*epidemiology/mortality/*pathology', 'United States/epidemiology']",2009/12/05 06:00,2009/12/30 06:00,['2009/12/05 06:00'],"['2009/03/10 00:00 [received]', '2009/09/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/12/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/12/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2009/12/30 06:00 [medline]']","['S0039-6060(09)00549-2 [pii]', '10.1016/j.surg.2009.09.020 [doi]']",ppublish,Surgery. 2009 Dec;146(6):1105-15. doi: 10.1016/j.surg.2009.09.020.,146,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The most common subtype of t-AML ( approximately 75% of cases) develops after exposure to alkylating agents, and is characterized by loss or deletion of chromosome 5 and/or 7 [-5/del(5q), -7/del(7q)], and a poor outcome (median survival 8 months). In the University of Chicago's series of 386 patients with t-MDS/t-AML, 79 (20%) patients had abnormalities of chromosome 5, 95 (25%) patients had abnormalities of chromosome 7, and 85 (22%) patients had abnormalities of both chromosomes 5 and 7. t-MDS/t-AML with a -5/del(5q) is associated with a complex karyotype, characterized by trisomy 8, as well as loss of 12p, 13q, 16q22, 17p (TP53 locus), chromosome 18, and 20q. In addition, this subtype of t-AML is characterized by a unique expression profile (higher expression of genes) involved in cell cycle control (CCNA2, CCNE2, CDC2), checkpoints (BUB1), or growth (MYC), loss of expression of IRF8, and overexpression of FHL2. Haploinsufficiency of the RPS14, EGR1, APC, NPM1, and CTNNA1 genes on 5q has been implicated in the pathogenesis of MDS/AML. In previous studies, we determined that Egr1 acts by haploinsufficiency and cooperates with mutations induced by alkylating agents to induce myeloid leukemias in the mouse. To identify mutations that cooperate with Egr1 haploinsufficiency, we used retroviral insertional mutagenesis. To date, we have identified two common integration sites involving genes encoding transcription factors that play a critical role in hematopoiesis (Evi1 and Gfi1b loci). Of note is that the EVI1 transcription factor gene is deregulated in human AMLs, particularly those with -7, and abnormalities of 3q. Identifying the genetic pathways leading to t-AML will provide new insights into the underlying biology of this disease, and may facilitate the identification of new therapeutic targets.","['Qian, Zhijian', 'Joslin, John M', 'Tennant, Thelma R', 'Reshmi, Shalini C', 'Young, David J', 'Stoddart, Angela', 'Larson, Richard A', 'Le Beau, Michelle M']","['Qian Z', 'Joslin JM', 'Tennant TR', 'Reshmi SC', 'Young DJ', 'Stoddart A', 'Larson RA', 'Le Beau MM']","['Section of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Medicine and the Cancer Research Center, University of Chicago, 5841 S Maryland Ave, MC2115, Chicago, IL 60637, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', 'Review']",20091201,Ireland,Chem Biol Interact,Chemico-biological interactions,0227276,,IM,"['Animals', '*Cytogenetic Analysis', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/*drug effects/*radiation effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/*genetics/radiotherapy', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/*genetics', 'Nucleophosmin']",2009/12/05 06:00,2010/04/24 06:00,['2009/12/05 06:00'],"['2009/09/16 00:00 [received]', '2009/11/21 00:00 [revised]', '2009/11/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/12/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/12/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/04/24 06:00 [medline]']","['S0009-2797(09)00496-7 [pii]', '10.1016/j.cbi.2009.11.025 [doi]']",ppublish,Chem Biol Interact. 2010 Mar 19;184(1-2):50-7. doi: 10.1016/j.cbi.2009.11.025.

However, its biological function is not fully clarified so far. This study was to investigate the biological function of human LRP16 gene by database-aided bioinformatics analysis. METHODS: The structures and functions of LRP16 gene promoter and its coding protein were analyzed using bioinformatics prediction, and further experimental testing was performed. The recombinants of pGL3-basic and LRP16 promoter subclones were constructed for luciferase activity analysis. The recombinant of LRP16 open reading frame coding sequence and pcDNA3.1 eukaryotic expression vector was established and transfected into HL-60 and K562 cell lines. DNA damage of HL-60 cells after ultraviolet irradiation was evaluated using single cell gel electrophoresis. Cell cycle of K562 cells was analyzed by flow cytometry. RESULTS: LRP16 promoter was a typical class II eukaryotic promoter and its core regulation sequence was located within upstream -600 bp of transcriptional start site. In addition, seven cis-acting elements, which may be implicated in cell cycle, hematopoiesis regulation, cell proliferation and repair of DNA damage, were identified. Long type LRP16 coding protein contained homologous sequences of hismacro, COG2110, and A1pp with human histone H2A1C between 148 and 315 amino acid residue. The number of comet cells and the length of comet tail in HL-60 cells irradiated were significantly decreased and the number of living cell was significantly increased in LRP16-overexpression group compared with empty plasmid control group. The proliferation rate and ratio or quantity of G2/M and S phases were significantly increased in LRP16-overexpression K562 group compared with empty plasmid control group. LRP16-overexpression in K562 cells promoted the transition of G1 to S phase and plateau phase of cell proliferation was advanced. CONCLUSIONS: Promoter regulation prediction and protein domain analysis based on bioinformatics contribute to the study of gene function. LRP16 may play an important role in leukemia progression by promoting cell proliferation, regulating cell cycle, and antagonizing radiation-induced DNA damage.","['Yang, Bo', 'Lu, Xue-Chun', 'Chi, Xiao-Hua', 'Han, Wei-Dong', 'Yu, Li', 'Lou, Fang-Ding']","['Yang B', 'Lu XC', 'Chi XH', 'Han WD', 'Yu L', 'Lou FD']","['Department of Geriatric Hematology, PLA General Hospital, Beijing 100853, P.

It comprises an ongoing population-based cohort of patients newly diagnosed by a single integrated haematopathology laboratory in two adjacent UK Cancer Networks (population 3.6 million). With an emphasis on primary-source data, prognostic factors, sequential treatment/response history, and socio-demographic details are recorded to clinical trial standards. Data on 8131 patients diagnosed over the 4 years 2004-08 are examined here using the latest World Health Organization classification. HMRN captures all diagnoses (adult and paediatric) and the diagnostic age ranged from 4 weeks to 99 years (median 70.4 years). In line with published estimates, first-line clinical trial entry varied widely by disease subtype and age, falling from 59.5% in those aged <15 years to 1.9% in those aged over 75 years - underscoring the need for contextual population-based treatment and response data of the type collected by HMRN. The critical importance of incorporating molecular and prognostic markers into comparative survival analyses is illustrated with reference to diffuse-large B-cell lymphoma, acute myeloid leukaemia and myeloma. With respect to aetiology, several descriptive factors are highlighted and discussed, including the unexplained male predominance evident for most subtypes across all ages.","['Smith, Alexandra', 'Roman, Eve', 'Howell, Debra', 'Jones, Richard', 'Patmore, Russell', 'Jack, Andrew']","['Smith A', 'Roman E', 'Howell D', 'Jones R', 'Patmore R', 'Jack A']","['Department of Health Sciences, University of York, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20091201,England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Health Services Research', '*Hematologic Neoplasms', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Young Adult']",2009/12/05 06:00,2010/06/30 06:00,['2009/12/05 06:00'],"['2009/12/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/12/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/06/30 06:00 [medline]']","['BJH8010 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1365-2141.2009.08010.x [doi]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2010 Mar;148(5):739-53. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.2009.08010.x.

The transcription factor C/EBPbeta may be involved in malignancy with its alternative translation product C/EBPbeta-LIP. We investigated a potential connection between FLT3 signalling and the C/EBPbeta system in FLT3-internal tandem duplication (ITD)-positive leukaemia cells and FLT3-ITD- or FLT3-wild type (WT)-transfected 32D cells. In FLT3-ITD-positive cells or when ITD sequences were inserted into the FLT3-WT receptor, significant LIP levels, increased LIP/LAP ratios, and enhanced proliferation rates were detected, which were reduced by FLT3 inhibition. In FLT3-WT cells, incubation with FLT3 receptor ligand (FL) also elevated LIP, LIP/LAP, and proliferation, albeit to a lesser extent. CEBPB-directed siRNA decreased both LIP and proliferation rates in FLT3-ITD-positive and FL-stimulated FLT3-WT-positive cells. PI3K inhibition affected ITD-associated and FL-induced LIP levels. Rapamycin, an inhibitor of mTOR involved in CEBPB translation, completely blocked the increase in LIP in FL-stimulated FLT3-WT- but not FLT3-ITD-positive cells. In contrast, the ITD-associated LIP elevation was mediated by p(90)-ribosomal-S6-kinase. This is the first report showing a LIP increase in the presence of ITD or following FL exposure. Our data suggest fundamental differences in the signalling cascades activated via ITD mutations or following FL stimulation, indicating the need for adapted molecular therapy.","['Haas, Sandra C', 'Huber, Rene', 'Gutsch, Romina', 'Kandemir, Judith D', 'Cappello, Christian', 'Krauter, Jurgen', 'Duyster, Justus', 'Ganser, Arnold', 'Brand, Korbinian']","['Haas SC', 'Huber R', 'Gutsch R', 'Kandemir JD', 'Cappello C', 'Krauter J', 'Duyster J', 'Ganser A', 'Brand K']","['Institute of Clinical Chemistry, Hannover Medical School, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20091201,England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Protein-beta)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (flt3 ligand protein)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Protein-beta/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunoblotting', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Membrane Proteins/metabolism', 'Middle Aged', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Signal Transduction/*genetics/*physiology', '*Tandem Repeat Sequences', 'Transcription Factors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*physiology']",2009/12/05 06:00,2010/06/30 06:00,['2009/12/05 06:00'],"['2009/12/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/12/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/06/30 06:00 [medline]']","['BJH8012 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1365-2141.2009.08012.x [doi]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2010 Mar;148(5):777-90. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.2009.08012.x.

METHODS: 12 patients with steroid-resistant extensive chronic GVHD were treated with MSCs. One patient received one dose, 10 received two doses, and the remaining three doses. The MSCs were obtained from HLA-identical sibling donors (n = 14), haploidentical donors (n = 2), unrelated mismatched donor (n = 1) and third-party HLA-mismatched donors (n = 7). Of the 11 patients treated with multiple infusions, 5 received cells derived from two donors. The median first dose of MSCs was 1.0 (0.4-2.1) x 10(6)/kg, the median second dose was 1.2 (0.8-1.9) x 10(6)/kg , and the third dose in one patient was 1.1 x 10(6)/kg. Meanwhile the proportion of CD3+, CD4+, CD8+, CD19+, CD4+, CD25+, FOXP3+, FOXP3+ CD4+ and FOXP3 + CD25+ was determined with double fluorescent-labeled antibodies and flow cytometry before and 4 weeks after the MSCs infusion. RESULTS: No patients had side-effects during or immediately after the infusions of MSCs. After a treatment course of one to three doses, 3 patients had complete response( CR), 6 showed partial response (PR) and 3 did not respond; the total effective rate was 75% (9/12). Complete resolution was seen in the involvement of skin (3/12), lung (1/3), joints (1/5), liver (3/10), oral cavity (4/12) and eye (2/7). Response rate was not related to donor HLA-match. 3 CR patients discontinued all of the immunosuppressive agents without relapse 100 to 292 days after the MSC infusion and 6 PR patients taped all immunosuppressive agents after 60 to 79 days. Mean follow-up period was 1152 (795-1914) days, leukemia free survival rate was 91.7% (11/12) and the overall survival rate was 75% (9/12). The ratio of CD4/CD8 and the proportion of regulatory T cells were significantly higher than that before MSCs treatment. CONCLUSION: Third-party MSCs were as effective as HLA-identical or haploidentical cells. This finding has practical implications and suggests that third-party cells can be prepared and stored frozen to be used for steroid-resistant extensive chronic GVHD therapy. It is concluded that MSCs may prevent the lethal cGVHD after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation and raise the survival rate by increasing the ratio of CD4/CD8 and proportion of regulatory T cells in vivo.","['Zhang, Le-Shi', 'Liu, Qi-Fa', 'Huang, Ke', 'Zhang, Yu', 'Fan, Zhi-Ping', 'Huang, Shao-Liang']","['Zhang LS', 'Liu QF', 'Huang K', 'Zhang Y', 'Fan ZP', 'Huang SL']","['Department of Hematology, Nanfang Hospital, Southern Medical University, Guangzhou 510515, China.']",['chi'],"['Clinical Trial', 'English Abstract', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,China,Zhonghua Nei Ke Za Zhi,Zhonghua nei ke za zhi,16210490R,['0 (Glucocorticoids)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Drug Resistance', 'Female', 'Glucocorticoids/pharmacology', 'Graft vs Host Disease/*prevention & control/*therapy', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/surgery', 'Male', '*Mesenchymal Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Young Adult']",2009/12/05 06:00,2010/02/05 06:00,['2009/12/05 06:00'],"['2009/12/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/12/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/02/05 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Zhonghua Nei Ke Za Zhi. 2009 Jul;48(7):542-6.,48,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Data was from 4 retrospective surveys regarding all causes of death during 1970-1974, 1985-1989, 1990-1992 and 2004-2005, in Shandong province. Other than one set of data collected in 1985-1989 by Shandong province itself, the other 3 set of data were from the national surveys, in which the survey-point sampling of choice was based on data of 1970-1974 for assessing its representativeness. The observing indices would include standardized mortality and mortality. A join-point regression model was used to analyze the changing rate of tumor. RESULTS: The mortality rate of the entire tumor increased 143.15 percent in 2005 than in 1970. The changing slope of standardized rate of all tumors in the regression model showed that the inter-annual growth rate were 0.54 and 1.24 percent from 1970 to 1984 and from 1985 to 1992. The rate of increase since 1992 had been 0.18 percent. During 2004-2005, the main malignant cancers were lung, stomach, liver, esophageal, colorectal, leukemia, breast and cervical cancer, in order. Lung cancer rose from the 4th ranking to the first while cervical cancer dropped from the fifth ranking to the 8th place. Esophageal cancer and cervical cancer were decreased annually while gastric cancer was increased in the early days but decreased later on. The rest of the cancers were on the rise year by year. Rates of lung and breast cancers were higher while gastric and esophageal cancers were lower seen in the urban than in rural areas. CONCLUSION: In Shandong province, a marked increase was seen in the mortality rate of tumors in the past 35 years. Evidence showed that the spectrum of death among main malignant tumors had changed which might provide a scientific basis for the development of a community-based prevention and control program on cancer.","['Li, Hao', 'Diao, Yu-Tao', 'Ma, Ji-Xiang', 'Xu, Ai-Qiang', 'Li, Hui-Qing', 'Ma, Qing', 'Yin, Chang', 'Cui, Jia', 'Cui, Yong-Chun']","['Li H', 'Diao YT', 'Ma JX', 'Xu AQ', 'Li HQ', 'Ma Q', 'Yin C', 'Cui J', 'Cui YC']","['Department of Hematology, Center of Oncology, Qilu Hospital of Shandong University, Jinan, China.']",['chi'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",,China,Zhonghua Liu Xing Bing Xue Za Zhi,Zhonghua liu xing bing xue za zhi = Zhonghua liuxingbingxue zazhi,8208604,,IM,"['Cause of Death', 'China/epidemiology', 'Data Collection', 'Humans', 'Mortality/*trends', 'Neoplasms/*epidemiology/mortality', 'Retrospective Studies']",2009/12/05 06:00,2010/05/18 06:00,['2009/12/05 06:00'],"['2009/12/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/12/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/05/18 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Zhonghua Liu Xing Bing Xue Za Zhi. 2009 Jun;30(6):592-5.,30,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Retrospective chart review was conducted on 24 pregnancies who were found bicytopenia or pancytopenia during pregnancy for the first time. The diagnoses were reconfirmed. The management and pregnancy outcome were collected. And the prognoses were followed. RESULTS: According to the clinical data and laboratory findings, the latter including complete blood cell count, reticulocyte count, peripheral smear, serum folate and vitamin B12 level, autoimmune antibody screening, bone marrow smear and biopsy, thirteen patients were diagnosed as having chronic aplastic anemia (CAA), six as having myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), two as having megaloblastic anemia (MA), one as having paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH), one as having Evan's syndrome and one as having acute leukemia. The management basically consisted of supportive transfusions. Six patients suffered pregnancy complications including four with severe preeclampsia (one with intracranial hemorrhage and one with intrauterine death concomitantly) and two with gestational diabetes. The delivery ages of the 21 patients were term or nearly term with all good neonatal outcomes. Postpartum follow-up showed the two patients with MA achieved complete remission, the one with PNH had mild anemia and that with Evan's syndrome had mild thrombocytopenia. The patient with acute leukemia died of recurrence six months postpartum. Of the thirteen patients with CAA, two achieved complete remission, six partial remission, four no remission and one was lost follow-up. Of the 6 patients with MDS, one achieved partial remission, four no remission, and one transformed into acute monocytic leukemia, then refused chemotherapy and was lost follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: CAA may be one of the most common causes of bicytopenia or pancytopenia during pregnancy, MDS may be the second.

METHODS: Promoter region of ID4 gene including the upstream - 3000 bp sequence of transcriptional start site and message RNA sequence were fished out. Online promoter analysis tools of TESS and Genomax were used to search possible sequence of transcriptional start site and message RNA sequence were fished out. Online promoter analysis tools of TESS and Genomax were used to search possible cis-acting structure from human transcription factor database. The activity of related drugs with potential effects upon ID4 gene expression was analyzed using SAGE database. GEO database was applied to search the gene expression profiling regulated by ID4 gene. Finally, similar analysis between gene expression profiling by ID4 and genome-wide profiling regulated by 163 known drugs or active compounds was manipulated to screen the drugs and candidate compounds with similar gene expression profiling with ID4 gene. MOLT4 cell line was treated with the above candidate active compounds to investigate the ID4 gene expression by RT-PCR assay. RESULTS: ID4 gene had a type II promoter with a typical TATA box in upstream -45 bp of transcription start site. The 1300 bp-length promoter of ID4 gene contained a few cis-acting structures classified into two function types, i. e. positive regulatory type, including transcription factors Spl and c-Myb, cAMP, glucocorticoid receptor (GR) and estrogen receptor (ER), and negative regulatory type, including Wilms tumor-1 (WT1) and early growth response-2 (EGR2). The similarity of gene expression profiling was identified between cAMP and ID4 gene. ID4 gene expression was induced in MOLT4 cell line after treatment with calcium dibutyryladenosine cyclophosphate at the concentration of 0.1 mmol/L. CONCLUSION: The comprehensive bioinformatic analysis, based upon the combination of regulatory sequence prediction of promoter, similarity analysis of gene expression profiling and literature review, can be considered as a practical tool in screening the candidate drugs with the activity of targeted regulating functional genes. Calcium dibutyryladenosine cyclophosphate can induce ID4 gene expression in leukemic cells.","['Yang, Bo', 'Lu, Xue-Chun', 'Liu, Li-Hong', 'Zhu, Hong-Li', 'Chi, Xiao-Hua', 'Yao, Shan-Qian', 'Lou, Fang-Ding', 'Yu, Li']","['Yang B', 'Lu XC', 'Liu LH', 'Zhu HL', 'Chi XH', 'Yao SQ', 'Lou FD', 'Yu L']","['Department of Geriatric Hematology, Chinese PLA General Hospital, Beijing 100853, China.']",['chi'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,China,Zhonghua Yi Xue Za Zhi,Zhonghua yi xue za zhi,7511141,"['0 (ID4 protein, human)', '0 (Inhibitor of Differentiation Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)']",IM,"['Cell Line, Tumor', '*Computational Biology', 'Humans', 'Inhibitor of Differentiation Proteins/*genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Regulatory Sequences, Nucleic Acid', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA', 'Up-Regulation']",2009/12/05 06:00,2010/02/03 06:00,['2009/12/05 06:00'],"['2009/12/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/12/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/02/03 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Zhonghua Yi Xue Za Zhi. 2009 Jun 23;89(24):1714-6.,89,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Based on the nitroblue tetrazolium (NBT) reduction assay, all the diterpenes were found to induce terminal differentiation in HL60 and K562 cells, with xylodiol being the most effective. NBT reduction was increased by almost 120% after 12 h exposure of HL60 cells to xylodiol at a concentration lower than the IC50 (50 microM).

Further experiments confirmed both up-regulation of P53 and down-regulation of CylinB1and C-myc. On the other hand, while P53 was found to be down-regulated. CylinB1 and C-myc were up-regulated. after Per2 knockdown. In leukemia mice, Per2 transfection was shown to suppress cellular proliferation and accelerate apoptosis of K562 cells. Moreover, fewer leukemia cells were found to have infiltrated into the livers and spleens of the mice from the Per2 transfected group as compared with those from the control group. In summary, Per2 displayed a significant anti-tumor effect through cell cycle arrest and apoptosis induction in K562 cells.

METHODS: Open-label, randomized study. Patients with acute myelogenous leukemia or high-risk myelodysplastic syndrome undergoing induction chemotherapy or first salvage were eligible. Patients received voriconazole (400 mg intravenous (i.v.) every 12 h for two doses, followed by 300 mg BID) or itraconazole (200 mg i.v. twice daily for 2 days, followed by 200 mg i.v. daily). RESULTS: A total of 127 patients were enrolled. Four were excluded because they did not receive study drug (n=3) or received two antifungal agents during the first week on study (n =1), leaving 123 patients for analysis. None of the 71 patients receiving voriconazole developed proven or probable invasive fungal infection, compared to two (4%) of the 52 patients receiving itraconazole (P=0.17). Drug discontinuation because of adverse events occurred in 15 patients (21%) receiving voriconazole and six (11%) receiving itraconazole (P=0.23). CONCLUSIONS: Voriconazole is a good alternative for prophylaxis in patients with leukemia.

METHODS: We studied these metabolites in 229 blood samples from 18 children with ALL (N = 16) or NHL (N = 2) on 6MP/Methotrexate maintenance therapy. RESULTS: DNA-6TGN levels were significantly correlated to E-6TGN (r (p) = 0.66, p = 0.003) with a trend to reach a plateau at high E-6TGN levels. To explore the relative DNA incorporation of 6TGN in relation to cytosol 6TGN levels, a DNA-6TGN index was calculated as DNA-6TGN/E-6TGN. The DNA-6TGN index was inversely correlated to E-6TGN (r (p) = -0.58, p = 0.012), which implies that with increasing levels of E-6TGN relatively less 6TGN are incorporated into DNA. E-MeMP levels were correlated to the DNA-TGN index (r (p) = 0.60, p = 0.008), indicating that high levels of MeMP result in enhanced DNA-6TGN incorporation, possibly due to inhibition of purine de novo synthesis, mediated by some of the methylated 6MP metabolites. CONCLUSIONS: DNA-6TGN may prove to be a more relevant pharmacokinetic parameter for monitoring 6MP treatment intensity than the previously used erythrocyte 6MP metabolites levels. Prospective clinical trials are needed to evaluate the usefulness of DNA-6TGN for individual dose adjustments.","['Hedeland, Rikke L', 'Hvidt, Kristian', 'Nersting, Jacob', 'Rosthoj, Susanne', 'Dalhoff, Kim', 'Lausen, Birgitte', 'Schmiegelow, Kjeld']","['Hedeland RL', 'Hvidt K', 'Nersting J', 'Rosthoj S', 'Dalhoff K', 'Lausen B', 'Schmiegelow K']","['The Section for Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Pediatric Clinic II, The Juliane Marie Center, The University Hospital, Rigshospitalet, 2100, Copenhagen, Denmark.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20091203,Germany,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol,Cancer chemotherapy and pharmacology,7806519,"['0 (Guanine Nucleotides)', '0 (Purines)', '0 (Thionucleotides)', '15867-02-4 (6-thioguanylic acid)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'E7WED276I5 (Mercaptopurine)', 'W60KTZ3IZY (purine)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cytosol/metabolism', 'DNA/*metabolism', 'Drug Monitoring', 'Erythrocytes/*metabolism', 'Female', 'Guanine Nucleotides/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/drug therapy', 'Male', 'Mercaptopurine/administration & dosage/*pharmacokinetics', 'Methotrexate/administration & dosage', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy', 'Purines/antagonists & inhibitors/biosynthesis', 'Thionucleotides/*metabolism']",2009/12/04 06:00,2010/07/14 06:00,['2009/12/04 06:00'],"['2009/07/29 00:00 [received]', '2009/11/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/12/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/12/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/07/14 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00280-009-1184-5 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol. 2010 Aug;66(3):485-91. doi: 10.1007/s00280-009-1184-5.

SY-103 metabolites through activation of caspase-3 and inactivation of Akt.,31-40,,"We isolated 23 marine actinomycetes from seawater samples. Of these, strain SY-103 exhibited the strongest cytotoxic activity on human leukemic cell lines. Biochemical tests and 16S rDNA sequencing of this strain allowed us to identify SY-103 as a strain of the genus Streptomyces. In the present study, the pure cytotoxic compound (PCC) from Streptomyces sp. SY-103 metabolites was purified by reverse-phase HPLC and the biochemical mechanisms of PCC-induced apoptosis in cultured human leukemic cell lines were investigated. The exposure of cells to PCC resulted in growth inhibition and induction of apoptosis, which was associated with the proteolytic activation of caspase-3 and down-regulation of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 protein. However, PCC-induced caspase-3 activation and apoptosis were significantly attenuated in Bcl-2 overexpressing U937 cells. z-DEVD-fmk, a caspase-3 specific inhibitor, blocked caspase-3 activation and increased the survival rate of PCC-treated U937 cells. The activity of Akt was also inhibited in PCC-treated cells, and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt inhibitor, LY294002, sensitized the cells to PCC-induced apoptosis indicating that the down-regulation of the Akt signaling pathway plays a key role in PCC-induced apoptosis. Our findings imply that some of the biological functions of Bcl-2 and PI3K/Akt are attributed to their ability to inhibit PCC-induced apoptosis; therefore, it is suggested that this compound is a promising anti-cancer agent for leukemia cells.","['Jeong, Seong-Yun', 'Han, Min Ho', 'Jin, Cheng-Yun', 'Kim, Gi-Young', 'Choi, Byung Tae', 'Nam, Taek-Jeong', 'Kim, Se-Kwon', 'Choi, Yung Hyun']","['Jeong SY', 'Han MH', 'Jin CY', 'Kim GY', 'Choi BT', 'Nam TJ', 'Kim SK', 'Choi YH']","['Department of Medical Life Science, Catholic University of Daegu, Daegu 712-702, Republic of Korea.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Greece,Int J Mol Med,International journal of molecular medicine,9810955,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Bacterial Toxins)', '0 (Chromones)', '0 (Morpholines)', '0 (Phosphoinositide-3 Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '31M2U1DVID (2-(4-morpholinyl)-8-phenyl-4H-1-benzopyran-4-one)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/isolation & purification/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Bacterial Toxins/isolation & purification/*pharmacology', 'Caspase 3/*metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Chromones/pharmacology', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy', 'Morpholines/pharmacology', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/metabolism', 'Phosphoinositide-3 Kinase Inhibitors', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/genetics/metabolism', 'Streptomyces/*metabolism']",2009/12/04 06:00,2010/03/10 06:00,['2009/12/04 06:00'],"['2009/12/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/12/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/03/10 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Int J Mol Med. 2010 Jan;25(1):31-40.,25,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Combination of low doses of ATRA or 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 that do not induce toxicity with another drug is a useful strategy for acute promyelocytic leukemia therapy.

Treatment of HL-60 cells with zero to 100 microg/ml of KV-1 for 72 h induced a small increase in cell differentiation. Surprisingly, a synergistic induction of differentiation was observed when the HL-60 cells were treated with ATRA or 1,25-(OH)2D3 and the extract. The inhibitors of protein kinase C (PKC) (alpha and betaI) and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), but not of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3-K) and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) inhibited the HL-60 differentiation induced by the extract in combination of ATRA or 1,25-(OH)2D3, suggesting that PKC and ERK were involved in the cell differentiation enhancement by the extract. The results indicate that the acetone extract of D. kaki leaves has the ability to enhance HL-60 cell differentiation and suggest that it may be useful in acute promyelocytic leukemia therapy.","['Kim, Seung Hyun', 'Cho, Seung Sik', 'Simkhada, Jaya Ram', 'Park, Sung Ju', 'Lee, Hyo Jeong', 'Kim, Tae Sung', 'Yoo, Jin Cheol']","['Kim SH', 'Cho SS', 'Simkhada JR', 'Park SJ', 'Lee HJ', 'Kim TS', 'Yoo JC']","['School of Life Sciences and Biotechnology, Korea University, Seoul, Korea.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Greece,Oncol Rep,Oncology reports,9422756,"['0 (Plant Extracts)', '1364PS73AF (Acetone)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'FXC9231JVH (Calcitriol)']",IM,"['Acetone/chemistry', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/pharmacology', 'Calcitriol/metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation/*drug effects', 'Cell Survival', 'Diospyros/*metabolism', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Granulocytes/cytology', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*drug therapy', 'Models, Biological', 'Monocytes/cytology', 'Plant Extracts/*pharmacology', 'Tretinoin/metabolism']",2009/12/04 06:00,2010/03/20 06:00,['2009/12/04 06:00'],"['2009/12/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/12/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/03/20 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Oncol Rep. 2010 Jan;23(1):89-95.,23,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Despite their prevalence, particularly in pediatric acute leukemia, many molecular details of their transforming mechanism are unknown. Here, we provide mechanistic insight into the function of MLL fusions, demonstrating that they capture a transcriptional elongation complex that has been previously found associated with the eleven-nineteen leukemia protein (ENL). We show that this complex consists of a tight core stabilized by recursive protein-protein interactions. This central part integrates histone H3 lysine 79 methylation, RNA Polymerase II (RNA Pol II) phosphorylation, and MLL fusion partners to stimulate transcriptional elongation as evidenced by RNA tethering assays. Coimmunoprecipitations indicated that MLL fusions are incorporated into this complex, causing a constitutive recruitment of elongation activity to MLL target loci. Chromatin immunoprecipitations (ChIP) of the homeobox gene A cluster confirmed a close relationship between binding of MLL fusions and transcript levels. A time-resolved ChIP utilizing a conditional MLL fusion singled out H3K79 methylation as the primary parameter correlated with target expression. The presence of MLL fusion proteins also kept RNA Pol II in an actively elongating state and prevented accumulation of inhibitory histone methylation on target chromatin. Hox loci remained open and productive in the presence of MLL fusion activity even under conditions of forced differentiation. Finally, MLL-transformed cells were particularly sensitive to pharmacological inhibition of RNA Pol II phosphorylation, pointing to a potential treatment for MLL. In summary, we show aberrant transcriptional elongation as a novel mechanism for oncogenic transformation.","['Mueller, Dorothee', 'Garcia-Cuellar, Maria-Paz', 'Bach, Christian', 'Buhl, Sebastian', 'Maethner, Emanuel', 'Slany, Robert K']","['Mueller D', 'Garcia-Cuellar MP', 'Bach C', 'Buhl S', 'Maethner E', 'Slany RK']","['Department of Genetics, University Erlangen, Erlangen, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20091124,United States,PLoS Biol,PLoS biology,101183755,"['0 (ELL protein, human)', '0 (Flavonoids)', '0 (KMT2A protein, human)', '0 (Piperidines)', '0 (Transcriptional Elongation Factors)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', '45AD6X575G (alvocidib)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 9)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line, Tumor', '*Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'Chromatin Assembly and Disassembly', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 9/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Flavonoids', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/*metabolism', 'Piperidines', 'Transcriptional Elongation Factors/*metabolism']",2009/12/04 06:00,2010/03/17 06:00,['2009/12/04 06:00'],"['2009/08/24 00:00 [received]', '2009/10/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/12/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/12/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/03/17 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1371/journal.pbio.1000249 [doi]'],ppublish,PLoS Biol. 2009 Nov;7(11):e1000249. doi: 10.1371/journal.pbio.1000249.

However, the manner in which STAT5 responds to early-acting and lineage-restricted cytokines, particularly in leukemic stem/progenitor cells, is largely unknown. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We optimized a multiparametric flow cytometry protocol to analyze STAT5 phosphorylation upon cytokine stimulation in stem and progenitor cell compartments at a single-cell level. In normal cord blood (CB) cells, STAT5 phosphorylation was efficiently induced by TPO, IL-3 and GM-CSF within CD34(+)CD38(-) hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). EPO- and SCF-induced STAT5 phosphorylation was largely restricted to the megakaryocyte-erythroid progenitor (MEP) compartment, while G-CSF as well IL-3 and GM-CSF were most efficient in inducing STAT5 phosphorylation in the myeloid progenitor compartments. Strikingly, mobilized adult peripheral blood (PB) CD34(+) cells responded much less efficiently to cytokine-induced STAT5 activation, with the exception of TPO. In leukemic stem and progenitor cells, highly distinct cytokine responses were observed, differing significantly from their normal counterparts. These responses could not be predicted by the expression level of cytokine receptors. Also, heterogeneity existed in cytokine requirements for long-term expansion of AML CD34(+) cells on stroma. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: In conclusion, our optimized multiparametric flow cytometry protocols allow the analysis of signal transduction at the single cell level in normal and leukemic stem and progenitor cells. Our study demonstrates highly distinctive cytokine responses in STAT5 phosphorylation in both normal and leukemic stem/progenitor cells.","['Han, Lina', 'Wierenga, Albertus T J', 'Rozenveld-Geugien, Marjan', 'van de Lande, Kim', 'Vellenga, Edo', 'Schuringa, Jan Jacob']","['Han L', 'Wierenga AT', 'Rozenveld-Geugien M', 'van de Lande K', 'Vellenga E', 'Schuringa JJ']","['Department of Hematology, University of Groningen, University Medical Center Groningen, Groningen, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20091124,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (STAT5 Transcription Factor)', 'EC 3.2.2.6 (ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1)']",IM,"['ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1/biosynthesis', 'Antigens, CD34/biosynthesis', 'Cell Lineage', 'Cell Separation', 'Cytokines/*metabolism', 'Fetal Blood/cytology/*metabolism', 'Flow Cytometry/methods', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'STAT5 Transcription Factor/*metabolism', '*Signal Transduction', 'Stem Cells/*cytology']",2009/12/04 06:00,2010/04/27 06:00,['2009/12/04 06:00'],"['2009/09/22 00:00 [received]', '2009/10/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/12/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/12/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/04/27 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1371/journal.pone.0007989 [doi]'],epublish,PLoS One. 2009 Nov 24;4(11):e7989. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0007989.,4,,,PMC2776352,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The absence of identifiable mutations in the majority of WTs suggests the frequent involvement of epigenetic aberrations in WT. We therefore conducted a genome-wide analysis of promoter hypermethylation in WTs and identified hypermethylation at chromosome 5q31 spanning 800 kilobases (kb) and more than 50 genes. The methylated genes all belong to alpha-, beta-, and gamma-protocadherin (PCDH) gene clusters (Human Genome Organization nomenclature PCDHA@, PCDHB@, and PCDHG@, respectively). This demonstrates that long-range epigenetic silencing (LRES) occurs in developmental tumors as well as in adult tumors. Bisulfite polymerase chain reaction analysis showed that PCDH hypermethylation is a frequent event found in all Wilms' tumor subtypes. Hypermethylation is concordant with reduced PCDH expression in tumors. WT precursor lesions showed no PCDH hypermethylation, suggesting that de novo PCDH hypermethylation occurs during malignant progression. Discrete boundaries of the PCDH domain are delimited by abrupt changes in histone modifications; unmethylated genes flanking the LRES are associated with permissive marks which are absent from methylated genes within the domain. Silenced genes are marked with non-permissive histone 3 lysine 9 dimethylation. Expression analysis of embryonic murine kidney and differentiating rat metanephric mesenchymal cells demonstrates that Pcdh expression is developmentally regulated and that Pcdhg@ genes are expressed in blastemal cells. Importantly, we show that PCDHs negatively regulate canonical Wnt signalling, as short-interfering RNA-induced reduction of PCDHG@ encoded proteins leads to elevated beta-catenin protein, increased beta-catenin/T-cell factor (TCF) reporter activity, and induction of Wnt target genes. Conversely, over-expression of PCDHs suppresses beta-catenin/TCF-reporter activity and also inhibits colony formation and growth of cancer cells in soft agar. Thus PCDHs are candidate tumor suppressors that modulate regulatory pathways critical in development and disease, such as canonical Wnt signaling.","['Dallosso, Anthony R', 'Hancock, Anne L', 'Szemes, Marianna', 'Moorwood, Kim', 'Chilukamarri, Laxmi', 'Tsai, Hsin-Hao', 'Sarkar, Abby', 'Barasch, Jonathan', 'Vuononvirta, Raisa', 'Jones, Chris', 'Pritchard-Jones, Kathy', 'Royer-Pokora, Brigitte', 'Lee, Sean Bong', 'Owen, Ceris', 'Malik, Sally', 'Feng, Yi', 'Frank, Marcus', 'Ward, Andrew', 'Brown, Keith W', 'Malik, Karim']","['Dallosso AR', 'Hancock AL', 'Szemes M', 'Moorwood K', 'Chilukamarri L', 'Tsai HH', 'Sarkar A', 'Barasch J', 'Vuononvirta R', 'Jones C', 'Pritchard-Jones K', 'Royer-Pokora B', 'Lee SB', 'Owen C', 'Malik S', 'Feng Y', 'Frank M', 'Ward A', 'Brown KW', 'Malik K']","['Cancer and Leukaemia in Childhood-Sargent Research Unit, Department of Cellular and Molecular Medicine, School of Medical Sciences, University of Bristol, Bristol, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20091126,United States,PLoS Genet,PLoS genetics,101239074,"['0 (Cadherins)', '0 (PCDH1 protein, human)', '0 (Protocadherins)', '0 (Wnt Proteins)', '0 (beta Catenin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cadherins/*genetics', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 5/*genetics', 'DNA Methylation', '*Epigenesis, Genetic', 'Gene Expression Regulation', '*Gene Silencing', 'Genome-Wide Association Study', 'Humans', 'Mice', '*Multigene Family', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/genetics', 'Protocadherins', 'Rats', 'Signal Transduction/genetics', 'Wilms Tumor/*genetics', 'Wnt Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'beta Catenin/genetics']",2009/12/04 06:00,2010/04/09 06:00,['2009/12/04 06:00'],"['2009/03/30 00:00 [received]', '2009/10/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/12/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/12/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/04/09 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1371/journal.pgen.1000745 [doi]'],ppublish,PLoS Genet. 2009 Nov;5(11):e1000745. doi: 10.1371/journal.pgen.1000745.

We investigated whether monoclonal antibodies directed against IL-6 may enable to reverse resistance of cancer cell lines. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We exposed ten haematological cancer cells from lymphoma, myeloma, or leukemia origins to cytotoxics or ionizing radiations and assessed the effects of anti-IL-6 antibody addition on cell proliferation, apoptosis, or IL-6 signaling. A strong correlation between IL-6 secretion, measured by ELISA, and resistance to doxorubicin as ionizing radiations was observed in the multiple myeloma U266 and the Burkitt's lymphoma Daudi and Namalwa cells. Although an anti-IL-6 antibody combined to both treatments efficiently blocked IL-6 signaling in U266 cells, expressing the IL-6 receptor gp80, it did not increase treatment-induced anti-proliferative and pro-apoptotic effects on these cells, as well as on Daudi and Namalwa cells. This lack of effect could be related to diverse factors: 1) a higher release of the soluble form of IL-6 receptor gp80 in response to doxorubicin and irradiation from all cell lines, 2) an impaired level of the IL-6 pathway inhibitor SOCS3 in Daudi cells, and 3) an increased release of IL-10 and TNFalpha, two cytokines involved in cell radio- and chemoresistance.

Activation of CD38 by means of agonistic monoclonal antibodies or the CD31 ligand induces proliferation and immunoblast differentiation of CLL cells. Here we define the genetic signature that follows long-term in vitro interactions between CD38(+) CLL lymphocytes and CD31(+) cells. The emerging profile confirms that the CD31/CD38 axis activates genetic programs relevant for proliferative responses. It also indicates a contribution of this pathway to the processes mediating migration and homing.

In this study, the ability of a novel arsenical compound, As(4)O(6) (tetraarsenic oxide), along with As(2)O(3), for its ability to induce cell growth inhibition, as well as apoptosis, in human cervical cancer cells, SiHa cells, were evaluated in vitro. MATERIALS AND METHODS: To examine the levels of apoptosis, SiHa cells were given two sensitive doses, 0.5 and 1 microM, of arsenical compounds, and a DNA fragmentation assay and FACS analysis were then conducted. In addition, a Western blotting assay was performed to identify target molecules for apoptosis. RESULTS: Both As(2)O(3) and As(4)O(6) induced dosedependent inhibition of SiHa cell proliferation. In particular, As(4)O(6) was more effective at suppressing SiHa cell growth than As(2)O(3). In parallel with the inhibition of cell proliferation, As(4)O(6) caused a significantly greater increase in the sub-G1 cell population than As(2)O(3), as determined by propidium iodide DNA staining. This was confirmed by a DNA fragmentation assay and annexin V staining. The Western blotting analysis also showed that the expression of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) was suppressed to a significantly greater extent by As(4)O(6) than As(2)O(3) at a dose of 0.5 microM. However, the apoptosis-related protein, Bax, was expressed to a significantly greater extent due to As(4)O(6) than As(2)O(3). CONCLUSION: Taken together, these findings suggest that a novel arsenic compound, As(4)O(6), possesses more potent anti-proliferative effects on human cervical cancer cells, with the induction of apoptosis also, at least via the activation of Bax protein in vitro.","['Kim, Jeong', 'Bae, Su-Mi', 'Lim, Dae-Seog', 'Kwak, Sun-Young', 'Lee, Chang-Ki', 'Lee, Yong-Seok', 'Bae, Il-Ju', 'Yoo, Jin-Young', 'Lee, Young-Joo', 'Kim, Chong-Kook', 'Ahn, Woong-Shick']","['Kim J', 'Bae SM', 'Lim DS', 'Kwak SY', 'Lee CK', 'Lee YS', 'Bae IJ', 'Yoo JY', 'Lee YJ', 'Kim CK', 'Ahn WS']","['Departments of Obstetrics and Gynecology, The Catholic University of Korea College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Retracted Publication']",20051031,Korea (South),Cancer Res Treat,Cancer research and treatment,101155137,,,,2005/10/01 00:00,2005/10/01 00:01,['2009/12/04 06:00'],"['2005/08/18 00:00 [received]', '2005/09/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/12/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2005/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2005/10/01 00:01 [medline]']",['10.4143/crt.2005.37.5.307 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Res Treat. 2005 Oct;37(5):307-12. doi: 10.4143/crt.2005.37.5.307.

The package, which is tightly integrated with other Bioconductor software for analysis of flow cytometry, provides tools to transform raw flow cytometry data into a form suitable for direct input into conventional statistical analysis and empirical modeling software tools. The approach of flowFP is to generate a description of the multivariate probability distribution function of flow cytometry data in the form of a ""fingerprint."" As such, it is independent of a presumptive functional form for the distribution, in contrast with model-based methods such as Gaussian Mixture Modeling. FlowFP is computationally efficient and able to handle extremely large flow cytometry data sets of arbitrary dimensionality. Algorithms and software implementation of the package are described. Use of the software is exemplified with applications to data quality control and to the automated classification of Acute Myeloid Leukemia.","['Rogers, Wade T', 'Holyst, Herbert A']","['Rogers WT', 'Holyst HA']","['Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, 207 John Morgan Bldg., Philadelphia, PA 19104-6082, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20090924,Egypt,Adv Bioinformatics,Advances in bioinformatics,101515444,,,,2009/12/04 06:00,2009/12/04 06:01,['2009/12/04 06:00'],"['2009/04/01 00:00 [received]', '2009/06/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/12/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/12/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2009/12/04 06:01 [medline]']",['10.1155/2009/193947 [doi]'],ppublish,Adv Bioinformatics. 2009:193947. doi: 10.1155/2009/193947.

Limitations of breaking tolerance to leukemic cells and lack of specific activation of T cell-mediated cytotoxicity may explain the discouraging clinical results with this approach. To break self-tolerance against AML cells, we loaded DCs with AML antigens and a bifunctional small interference (si) RNA targeting interleukin (IL) 10 and simultaneously activating toll-like receptors (TLRs). In vitro, this active siRNA inhibited (P < .05) IL-10 production by silencing the IL-10 gene in DCs. The active siRNA stimulated production of tumor necrosis factor alpha, implying activation of TLRs. Vaccination in a nonimmunogenic rat model mimicking human AML with the loaded DCs induced a substantial and specific T-cell cytotoxicity. Leukemic rats treated with the active siRNA lived longer and had markedly less leukemic cell mass infiltrating their bone marrow compared with rats given inactive siRNA (P < .05). Furthermore, compared with inactive siRNA treatment, the active siRNA led to significantly less extramedullar leukemic dissemination, evidenced by reduced matrix metalloproteinase activity and smaller spleens. Our data demonstrate that this bifunctional siRNA may work as an immunomodulatory drug with antileukemic properties.","['Iversen, Per O', 'Semaeva, Elvira', 'Sorensen, Dag R', 'Wiig, Helge', 'Sioud, Mouldy']","['Iversen PO', 'Semaeva E', 'Sorensen DR', 'Wiig H', 'Sioud M']","['Department of Nutrition, Faculty of Medicine, University of Oslo, Oslo, Norway.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Transl Oncol,Translational oncology,101472619,,,,2009/12/04 06:00,2009/12/04 06:01,['2009/12/04 06:00'],"['2009/05/30 00:00 [received]', '2009/06/10 00:00 [revised]', '2009/06/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/12/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/12/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2009/12/04 06:01 [medline]']",['10.1593/tlo.09154 [doi]'],ppublish,Transl Oncol. 2009 Dec;2(4):242-6. doi: 10.1593/tlo.09154.,2,,,PMC2781069,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

MATERIALS AND METHODS: The incidence of cancer in Korea was calculated based on the Korea Central Cancer Registry database, data from additional medical record review survey, the Regional Cancer Registry databases, site-specific cancer registry databases, and cancer mortality data from the Korea National Statistical Office. Crude and age-standardized rates were calculated by sex for 18 age groups. RESULTS: The overall crude incidence rates (CR) were 247.3 and 188.3 per 100,000 for men and women and the overall age-standardized incidence rates (ASR) were 281.2 and 160.3 per 100,000, respectively. Among men, five leading primary cancer sites were stomach (CR 58.6, ASR 65.6), lung (CR 42.1, ASR 50.9), liver (CR 41.9, ASR 44.9), colon and rectum (CR 24.2, ASR 27.3) and bladder (CR 7.7, ASR 9.2). Among women, the most common cancers were stomach (CR 30.8, ASR 25.8), breast (CR 25.7, ASR 21.7), colon and rectum (CR 19.6, ASR 16.7), uterine cervix (CR 18.4, ASR 15.5), and lung cancer (CR 15.1, ASR 12.4). In 0~14 age group, leukemia was most common for both sexes. For men, stomach cancer was most common in 15~64 age group, but lung cancer was more frequent for over 65 age group. For women, thyroid cancer in 15~34 age group, breast cancer in 35~64 age group, and stomach cancer in over 65 age group were most common for each age group. The proportions of death certificate only were 7.5% for men and 7.4% for women.

Using phorbol myristate acetate (PMA), it is possible to overcome this block in THP-1 cells (an M5-AML containing the MLL-MLLT3 fusion), resulting in differentiation to an adherent monocytic phenotype. As part of FANTOM4, we used microarrays to identify 23 microRNAs that are regulated by PMA. We identify four PMA-induced microRNAs (mir-155, mir-222, mir-424 and mir-503) that when overexpressed cause cell-cycle arrest and partial differentiation and when used in combination induce additional changes not seen by any individual microRNA. We further characterize these pro-differentiative microRNAs and show that mir-155 and mir-222 induce G2 arrest and apoptosis, respectively. We find mir-424 and mir-503 are derived from a polycistronic precursor mir-424-503 that is under repression by the MLL-MLLT3 leukemogenic fusion. Both of these microRNAs directly target cell-cycle regulators and induce G1 cell-cycle arrest when overexpressed in THP-1. We also find that the pro-differentiative mir-424 and mir-503 downregulate the anti-differentiative mir-9 by targeting a site in its primary transcript. Our study highlights the combinatorial effects of multiple microRNAs within cellular systems.","['Forrest, A R R', 'Kanamori-Katayama, M', 'Tomaru, Y', 'Lassmann, T', 'Ninomiya, N', 'Takahashi, Y', 'de Hoon, M J L', 'Kubosaki, A', 'Kaiho, A', 'Suzuki, M', 'Yasuda, J', 'Kawai, J', 'Hayashizaki, Y', 'Hume, D A', 'Suzuki, H']","['Forrest AR', 'Kanamori-Katayama M', 'Tomaru Y', 'Lassmann T', 'Ninomiya N', 'Takahashi Y', 'de Hoon MJ', 'Kubosaki A', 'Kaiho A', 'Suzuki M', 'Yasuda J', 'Kawai J', 'Hayashizaki Y', 'Hume DA', 'Suzuki H']","['LSA Technology Development Unit, Omics Science Center, RIKEN Yokohama Institute, Yokohama, Kanagawa, Japan. alistair.forrest@gmail.com']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20091203,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (MIRN155 microRNA, human)', '0 (MIRN222 microRNA, human)', '0 (MIRN503 microRNA, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Cell Cycle/drug effects', '*Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', '*Gene Expression Regulation', 'Humans', 'MicroRNAs/*physiology', 'Monocytes/*cytology', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology']",2009/12/04 06:00,2010/03/12 06:00,['2009/12/04 06:00'],"['2009/12/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/12/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/03/12 06:00 [medline]']","['leu2009246 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2009.246 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2010 Feb;24(2):460-6. doi: 10.1038/leu.2009.246.

Patients presented with generalized (n=18), localized (n=6), or solitary (n=9) macules, plaques, and/or tumors. Staging investigations at presentation were negative in 20 patients. Unusual histologic features included a perivascular/periadnexal pattern (6 biopsies from 4 patients) and the presence of pleomorphism of neoplastic cells with blastoid cells admixed with elongated, twisted, or hyperchromatic cells (observed in 24 specimens). Negativity of 1 among the 4 markers CD4, CD56, CD123, and TCL-1 was seen in 11 biopsies, and of 2 markers in 4 biopsies. Staining for CD68 revealed positivity of the majority of cells in 1 and of scattered cells in 24/37 stained cases. Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase was observed in 22/37 stained cases.

Our study shows that cutaneous lesions of BPDCN display a greater variability of morphologic and phenotypic features than recognized earlier. Discrete perivascular infiltrates, pleomorphic morphology of neoplastic cells, and unusual phenotypic profiles may be the source of diagnostic pitfalls. These atypical variants should be recognized to make an early diagnosis and to manage properly patients with this aggressive hematological disorder.","['Cota, Carlo', 'Vale, Esmeralda', 'Viana, Isabel', 'Requena, Luis', 'Ferrara, Gerardo', 'Anemona, Lucia', 'Metze, Dieter', 'Fink-Puches, Regina', 'Wiesner, Thomas', 'Cerroni, Lorenzo']","['Cota C', 'Vale E', 'Viana I', 'Requena L', 'Ferrara G', 'Anemona L', 'Metze D', 'Fink-Puches R', 'Wiesner T', 'Cerroni L']","['Research Unit of Dermatopathology, Department of Dermatology, Medical University of Graz, Graz, Austria.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Am J Surg Pathol,The American journal of surgical pathology,7707904,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/analysis', 'Dendritic Cells/metabolism/*pathology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Leukemia/metabolism/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Phenotype', 'Skin Neoplasms/metabolism/*pathology']",2009/12/04 06:00,2010/01/09 06:00,['2009/12/04 06:00'],"['2009/12/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/12/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/01/09 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1097/PAS.0b013e3181c5e26b [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Surg Pathol. 2010 Jan;34(1):75-87. doi: 10.1097/PAS.0b013e3181c5e26b.,34,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study was designed to find out whether ovarian cancer cells could induce peripheral mature DCs to differentiate into macrophages. MAIN METHODS: Mature DCs were cultured from monocytes with granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor and interleukin 4 (IL-4) for 6 days and lipopolysaccharide for another 24 hours and then were cocultured for 48 hours with ovarian cancer ascites or cell-free supernatants of SKOV3 and CAOV3 cell lines. In some experiments, mature DCs were cultured in the absence or presence of IL-10 or leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) for the same time. In neutralization experiments, neutralizing monoclonal antibodies to IL-10 or LIF were added to the cultures. Cell phenotypes and phagocytosis were analyzed using flow cytometry; allogeneic T-cell proliferation assay was used to examine stimulatory activity of cells. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Mature DCs cocultured with ovarian cancer ascites or supernatants of SKOV3 and CAOV3 differentiated into a group of macrophagelike cells that exhibited increased expression of surface marker CD14+CD1a-, decreased expression of CD83, poorer T-cell costimulatory properties, and greater endocytosis of fluorescein isothiocyanate-dextran in vitro.

Most leukemia cells are blocked from undergoing terminal differentiation and also exhibit uncontrolled proliferation. Dysregulated expression of transcription factor PU.1 is strongly associated with Friend virus-induced erythroleukemia. PU.1 inhibits erythroid differentiation by binding to and inhibiting GATA-1. PU.1 also may be involved in controlling proliferation of erythroid cells. We reported previously that the G(1) phase-specific cyclin-dependent kinase 6 (CDK6) also blocks erythroid differentiation. We now report that PU.1 directly stimulates transcription of the cdk6 gene in both normal erythroid progenitors and erythroleukemia cells, as well as in macrophages. We propose that PU.1 coordinates proliferation and differentiation in immature erythroid cells by inhibiting the GATA-1-mediated gene expression program and also by regulating expression of genes that control progression through the G(1) phase of the cell cycle, the period during which the decision to differentiate is made.","['Choe, Kevin S', 'Ujhelly, Olga', 'Wontakal, Sandeep N', 'Skoultchi, Arthur I']","['Choe KS', 'Ujhelly O', 'Wontakal SN', 'Skoultchi AI']","['Department of Cell Biology, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, New York 10461, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20091202,United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (GATA1 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Gata1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (proto-oncogene protein Spi-1)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (Cdk6 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 6)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Cycle', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 6/*metabolism', 'Erythroid Cells/*cytology', 'GATA1 Transcription Factor/metabolism', '*Gene Expression Regulation', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Mice', 'Models, Biological', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*metabolism', 'RNA, Small Interfering/metabolism', 'Trans-Activators/*metabolism']",2009/12/04 06:00,2010/02/26 06:00,['2009/12/04 06:00'],"['2009/12/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/12/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/02/26 06:00 [medline]']","['S0021-9258(20)64800-1 [pii]', '10.1074/jbc.M109.077727 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2010 Jan 29;285(5):3044-52. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M109.077727.

Therapeutic induction of p53 might therefore be particularly suitable for the treatment of haematological malignancies. Some of the anti-tumour activity of current chemotherapeutics has been derived from activation of p53. However, until recently it was unknown whether p53 signalling is functional in certain haematological cancers including MM and if p53 activity is sufficient to trigger an apoptotic response. With the recent discovery of nutlins, which represent the first highly selective small molecule inhibitors of the p53-MDM2 interaction, pharmacological tools are now available to induce p53 irrespective of upstream signalling defects, and to functionally analyse the downstream p53 pathway in primary leukaemia and lymphoma cells. Combination therapy is emerging as a key factor, and development of non-genotoxic combinations seems very promising for tackling the problems of toxicity and resistance. This review will highlight recent findings in the research into molecules capable of modulating p53 protein activities and mechanisms that activate the p53 pathway, restoring response to therapy in haematological malignancies.","['Saha, Manujendra N', 'Micallef, Johann', 'Qiu, Lugui', 'Chang, Hong']","['Saha MN', 'Micallef J', 'Qiu L', 'Chang H']","['Division of Cellular and Molecular Biology, Toronto General Hospital Research Institute, University of Toronto, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20091202,England,J Clin Pathol,Journal of clinical pathology,0376601,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Furans)', '0 (Imidazoles)', '0 (NSC 652287)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '53IA0V845C (nutlin 3)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (MDM2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-mdm2)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Furans/pharmacology', 'Genes, p53/drug effects', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/drug therapy/*metabolism/pathology', 'Humans', 'Imidazoles/pharmacology', 'Piperazines/pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-mdm2/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/genetics/*metabolism']",2009/12/04 06:00,2010/06/15 06:00,['2009/12/04 06:00'],"['2009/12/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/12/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/06/15 06:00 [medline]']","['jcp.2009.070961 [pii]', '10.1136/jcp.2009.070961 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Pathol. 2010 Mar;63(3):204-9. doi: 10.1136/jcp.2009.070961.

One reason for their decline is thought to be a high susceptibility to (infectious) diseases because cheetahs in zoos suffer from high disease-induced mortality. Data on the health status of free-ranging cheetahs are scarce, and little is known about their exposure and susceptibility to infectious diseases. We determined seroprevalences to nine key viruses (feline herpesvirus 1, feline calicivirus, feline parvovirus, feline coronavirus, canine distemper virus, feline immunodeficiency virus [FIV], puma lentivirus, feline leukemia virus, and rabies virus) in 68 free-ranging cheetahs on east-central Namibian farmland, 24 nonvaccinated Namibian captive cheetahs, and several other wild carnivore species and conducted necropsies of cheetahs and other wild carnivores. Eight of 11 other wild carnivores were seropositive for at least one of the viruses, including the first record of an FIV-like infection in a wild felid west of the Kalahari, the caracal (Felis caracal). Seroprevalences of the free-ranging cheetahs were below 5% for all nine viruses, which is significantly lower than seroprevalences in nonvaccinated captive cheetahs and those for five of seven viruses in previously studied free-ranging cheetahs from north-central Namibia (L. Munson, L. Marker, E. Dubovi, J. A. Spencer, J. F. Evermann, and S. J. O'Brien, J. Wildl. Dis. 40:23-31, 2004). There was no clinical or pathological evidence of infectious diseases in living or dead cheetahs. The results suggest that while free-ranging wild carnivores may be a source of pathogens, the distribution of seroprevalences across studies mirrored local human population density and factors associated with human habitation, probably reflecting contact opportunities with (nonvaccinated) domestic and feral cats and dogs. They also suggest that Namibian cheetahs respond effectively to viral challenges, encouraging consistent and sustainable conservation efforts.","['Thalwitzer, Susanne', 'Wachter, Bettina', 'Robert, Nadia', 'Wibbelt, Gudrun', 'Muller, Thomas', 'Lonzer, Johann', 'Meli, Marina L', 'Bay, Gert', 'Hofer, Heribert', 'Lutz, Hans']","['Thalwitzer S', 'Wachter B', 'Robert N', 'Wibbelt G', 'Muller T', 'Lonzer J', 'Meli ML', 'Bay G', 'Hofer H', 'Lutz H']","['Leibniz Institute for Zoo and Wildlife Research, Alfred-Kowalke-Strasse 17, D-10315 Berlin, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20091202,United States,Clin Vaccine Immunol,Clinical and vaccine immunology : CVI,101252125,,IM,"['Acinonyx/*virology', 'Animals', 'Cats', 'Dogs', 'Female', 'Male', 'Namibia/epidemiology', 'Seroepidemiologic Studies', 'Virus Diseases/diagnosis/epidemiology/*veterinary']",2009/12/04 06:00,2010/03/30 06:00,['2009/12/04 06:00'],"['2009/12/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/12/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/03/30 06:00 [medline]']","['CVI.00345-09 [pii]', '10.1128/CVI.00345-09 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Vaccine Immunol. 2010 Feb;17(2):232-8. doi: 10.1128/CVI.00345-09.

Essential to this regulation are the interactions between Bcl-2 family members, which are mediated by Bcl-2 homology (BH) domains. Vaccinia virus F1L is a unique inhibitor of apoptosis that lacks significant sequence similarity with the Bcl-2 family and does not contain obvious BH domains. Despite this, F1L inhibits cytochrome c release from mitochondria by preventing Bak and Bax activation. Although F1L constitutively interacts with Bak to prevent Bak activation, the precise mechanism of this interaction remains elusive. We have identified highly divergent BH domains in F1L that were verified by the recent crystal structure of F1L (Kvansakul, M., Yang, H., Fairlie, W. D., Czabotar, P. E., Fischer, S. F., Perugini, M. A., Huang, D. C., and Colman, P. M. (2008) Cell Death Differ. 15, 1564-1571). Here we show that F1L required these BH domains to interact with ectopically expressed and endogenous Bak. The interaction between F1L and Bak was conserved across species, and both F1L and the cellular antiapoptotic protein Mcl-1 required the Bak BH3 domain for interaction. Moreover, F1L replaced Mcl-1 during infection, as the Bak x Mcl-1 complex was disrupted during vaccinia virus infection. In contrast to UV irradiation, vaccinia virus infection did not result in rapid degradation of Mcl-1, consistent with our observation that vaccinia virus did not initiate a DNA damage response. Additionally, Mcl-1 expression prevented Bak activation and apoptosis during infection with a proapoptotic vaccinia virus devoid of F1L. Our data suggest that F1L replaces the antiapoptotic activity of Mcl-1 during vaccinia virus infection by interacting with Bak using highly divergent BH domains.","['Campbell, Stephanie', 'Hazes, Bart', 'Kvansakul, Marc', 'Colman, Peter', 'Barry, Michele']","['Campbell S', 'Hazes B', 'Kvansakul M', 'Colman P', 'Barry M']","['Department of Medical Microbiology and Immunology, University of Alberta, Edmonton, Alberta T6G 2S2, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20091202,United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (F1L protein, vaccinia virus)', '0 (Mcl1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Viral Proteins)', '0 (bcl-2 Homologous Antagonist-Killer Protein)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Chickens', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'Flow Cytometry', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Immunoblotting', 'Immunoprecipitation', 'Mice', 'Microscopy, Confocal', 'Mitochondria/metabolism', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary/genetics/radiation effects', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/genetics/*metabolism', 'Vaccinia virus/*metabolism/physiology', 'Viral Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'bcl-2 Homologous Antagonist-Killer Protein/genetics/*metabolism']",2009/12/04 06:00,2010/05/12 06:00,['2009/12/04 06:00'],"['2009/12/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/12/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/05/12 06:00 [medline]']","['S0021-9258(20)80975-2 [pii]', '10.1074/jbc.M109.053769 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2010 Feb 12;285(7):4695-708. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M109.053769.

HL-60 and K562 cells were treated by 2-deoxy-5-azacytidine (DAC) or ATRA respectively. Bisulfite modified DNA of these cells were amplified with PCR and quantitatively analyzed by pyrosequencing for methylation of CpG islands. RESULTS: In normal cells, CpGs at all loci of HOX A cluster were unmethylated. In HOX A4, A6, A7, A9, A10 and A11, many CpG sites were methylated (>20%) or hypermethylated (>50%) in leukemia cell lines.

SH-2 cells had the basically same morphological, immunophenotypic and cytogenetic features as the patient's leukemia cells did, such as myeloid morphology, an immunophenotype of CD13+, CD33+, CD56+, CD16/56+ and a hypodiploid karyotype of 45, X, -Y, der(16)t(16;17)(q24;ql2), -17, +19, which were gradually decreased and replaced by the near-tetraploid cells with a karyotype of 73-102(80), XX, -Y, -Y, del (q131)x2, der(16)t(16;17)(q24;q12)x2, -17, -17, +19, +19. FISH and multiple FISH delineated all the abnormalities and revealed a loss of one p53 allele due to monosomy 17. DNA direct sequencing detected a point mutation of CAG to CAT at codon 576 of exon 5 in another p53 allele. RT-PCR showed that SH-2 cells expressed apoptosis-related genes (bcl-2, Fas, GST-pi and p2) rather than MDR-related genes. Short tandem repeat PCR provided powerful evidence for the derivation of SH-2 cell line from the patient's leukemia cells. SH-2 cells had certain colony formation and tumorigenic capacities in nude and SCID mice. CONCLUSION: SH-2 is a new myeloid leukemia cell line with a unique biology background, and will provide a useful tool for leukemia research.","['Qiu, Hui-Ying', 'Xue, Yong-Quan', 'Zhang, Jun', 'Dai, Hai-Ping', 'Pan, Jin-Lan', 'Wu, Ya-Fang', 'Chen, Su-Ning', 'Wang, Yong', 'Shen, Juan', 'Sun, Ai-Ning', 'Wu, De-Pei']","['Qiu HY', 'Xue YQ', 'Zhang J', 'Dai HP', 'Pan JL', 'Wu YF', 'Chen SN', 'Wang Y', 'Shen J', 'Sun AN', 'Wu DP']","['Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, Jiangsu Institute of Hematology, Suzhou 215006, China.']",['chi'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,China,Zhonghua Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi,Zhonghua xue ye xue za zhi = Zhonghua xueyexue zazhi,8212398,,IM,"['Adult', 'Cell Culture Techniques', '*Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Separation', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/immunology/*pathology', 'Male']",2009/12/04 06:00,2011/06/17 06:00,['2009/12/04 06:00'],"['2009/12/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/12/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/06/17 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Zhonghua Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi. 2009 Jul;30(7):458-63.,30,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: According to the clinical guideline and scoring system for CLL in Britain, among 77 patients, 61 patients with score 5 called typical immunophenotype CLL, 16 with score 4 or 3 were atypical immunophenotype CLL. Multiparameter flow cytometry was employed for immunophenotypic analysis in 77 CLL patients for CD5, CD19, CD23, FMC7, sIg, CD20, CD79b expression and ZAP-70 protein and CD38. IgVH mutation status was detected by multiplex RT-PCR and sequencing of the purified PCR amplification products. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and a panel of probes were used to detect cytogenetic aberrations. RESULTS: There was no significant difference between the two groups in sex, age, ZAP-70 and IgVH mutation status (P=0.398, P=0.189, P=0.268 and P=0.131, respectively).

Human beta-defensin-1 (hBD-1) is an anti-microbial peptide of the innate immune system, which exerts a killing role against pathogens. In the present study, three polymorphisms have been genotyped, namely, -52G/A, -44C/G and -20G/A, of DEFB1 gene, coding for hBD-1, in 40 ALL patients and 40 healthy children, and tested for an association between genetic variants of the protein and seroprevalence of antibodies for herpes viruses. The seroprevalence of cytomegalovirus (CMV), herpes simplex viruses (HSV) and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) IgG antibodies in leukemic children was higher than that in controls (CMV: 61.5 vs. 27.3%, p = .008; HSV: 50 vs. 24.2%, p = .04; EBV: 61.3 vs. 46.2%, p = ns, respectively).

No such observation was made when we analyzed the immunization against Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) by GCA haplotype in case and controls (58 vs. 40%, p = ns). These findings suggest that leukemic patients carrying untranslated variants of hBD-1 display a higher susceptibility to herpes viruses infections than controls.","['Tesse, Riccardina', 'Santoro, Nicola', 'Giordano, Paola', 'Cardinale, Fabio', 'De Mattia, Domenico', 'Armenio, Lucio']","['Tesse R', 'Santoro N', 'Giordano P', 'Cardinale F', 'De Mattia D', 'Armenio L']","[""Department of Biomedicina dell'Eta' Evolutiva, Pediatric Unit S.

METHODS: Four hundred and thirty-five patients diagnosed as primary MDS in Sino-US Leukemia Cooperative Group of Shanghai were studied prospectively to identify the prognostic factors by Log-rank test and Cox regression model. RESULTS: The 3-year survival rate of MDS was 46.7%. The median survival time of refractory cytopenia with multilineage dysplasia (RCMD) subtype was 38 months and that of refractory anemia with excess blasts (RAEB) subtype was 10 months. Four hundred and twenty-four patients have successful karyotyping. According to the IPSS score, low risk, intermediate risk- I, intermediate risk-II and high risk group accounted for 38/424 (9.0%), 282/424 (66.5%), 74/ 424 (17.5%) and 30/424 (7.1%). Multivariate analysis of Cox model showed old age, lower neutrophil absolute count (NAC), lower hemoglobin, lower platelet count and IPSS group were independent factors associated with overall survival time (OS). WPSS was not an independent prognostic factor. For cases with RCMD, platelet count, IPSS score, IPSS cytogenetics group and chromosome abnormality were not independent prognostic factors; whereas age (> or = 60 years old), NAC (< 1.0 x 10(9)/L), Hb (< 90 g/L) and degree of cytopenia were independent factors. A new score system was established based on these factors. It had better ability to predict OS for RCMD patients as it was proved by univariate and multivariate analysis. CONCLUSION: The survival rate and median survival time of MDS in Chinese are similar to those in Western. IPSS score can predict prognosis for all MDS patients and it is better than WPSS. However, both of them have no validity for the prognostication of RCMD subtype. A new score system which can distinguish the different prognoses for RCMD patients is suggested.","['Wang, Xiao-Qin']",['Wang XQ'],"['Hematology Department of Huashan Hospital, Fudan University, Shanghai 200040, China. wangxiaoqin@shmu.edu.cn']",['chi'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",,China,Zhonghua Nei Ke Za Zhi,Zhonghua nei ke za zhi,16210490R,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*classification/*diagnosis', 'Prognosis', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'Prospective Studies', 'Reference Standards', 'Survival Rate', 'World Health Organization', 'Young Adult']",2009/12/04 06:00,2010/02/05 06:00,['2009/12/04 06:00'],"['2009/12/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/12/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/02/05 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Zhonghua Nei Ke Za Zhi. 2009 Aug;48(8):633-7.,48,,,,,,,,,,,['Sino-US Leukemia Cooperative Group of Shanghai'],,,,,,,,,

Despite indications of deficits based on cognitive assessment, the identification of specific mechanisms of neurocognitive deficits using neuroimaging techniques has yet to be adequately considered. PROCEDURE: This study used functional neuroimaging techniques to examine working memory and executive functioning deficits of survivors of childhood acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL), as compared to age- and gender-matched healthy controls. RESULTS: There was a trend for ALL survivors to perform more poorly on a working memory task in terms of overall accuracy. Additionally, survivors displayed significantly greater activation in areas underlying working memory (dorsolateral and ventrolateral prefrontal cortex) and error monitoring (dorsal and ventral anterior cingulate cortex). CONCLUSIONS: These results support the theory of compensatory activation in necessary brain regions in order to complete tasks in pediatric ALL survivors, similar to that observed in multiple sclerosis patients. Concurrent examination of testing and brain imaging enables the connection of behavioral observations with underlying neurological characteristics of deficits in survivors and may help provide insight into mechanisms through which deficits appear.","['Robinson, Kristen E', 'Livesay, Katherine L', 'Campbell, Laura K', 'Scaduto, Mary', 'Cannistraci, Christopher J', 'Anderson, Adam W', 'Whitlock, James A', 'Compas, Bruce E']","['Robinson KE', 'Livesay KL', 'Campbell LK', 'Scaduto M', 'Cannistraci CJ', 'Anderson AW', 'Whitlock JA', 'Compas BE']","['Department of Psychology and Human Development, Vanderbilt University, Nashville, Tennessee 37203, USA. kristen.e.robinson@vanderbilt.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Age of Onset', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*adverse effects', 'Brain/*drug effects', 'Brain Mapping', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cytarabine/adverse effects', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Intelligence Tests', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Male', 'Memory Disorders/*chemically induced', 'Memory, Short-Term/*drug effects', 'Methotrexate/adverse effects', '*Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma', '*Survivors']",2009/12/03 06:00,2010/04/20 06:00,['2009/12/03 06:00'],"['2009/12/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/12/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/04/20 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/pbc.22362 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2010 Apr;54(4):585-90. doi: 10.1002/pbc.22362.,54,"['P30 CA068485/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA068485-13S4/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA068485/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,PMC2901833,['NIHMS183910'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, standard therapies are toxic to normal tissues, cancer cells commonly develop resistance to chemotherapy, and relapsed malignancy is a leading cause of mortality in pediatrics. Elucidation of the principles of the normal immune response and tumor biology, coupled with technological developments, have led to important advances in the field of cancer immunotherapy. This review summarizes the biologic basis of cancer immunotherapy and highlights recent examples of progress in the application of novel humoral and cellular immunotherapies to children and adolescents with malignancy. RECENT FINDINGS: Clinical trials of immunotherapy for pediatric cancer have recently been initiated. To date, most immune-based therapies have been well tolerated and some have shown clinically significant activity against specific refractory high-risk malignancies. SUMMARY: Recent clinical trial results provide proof-of-principle that cancer immunotherapy has the capacity to overcome chemotherapy resistance without the usual toxicities associated with cytotoxic regimens. Immunotherapy holds promise in the treatment of children and adolescents with cancer and has the potential to improve both survival and quality of life.","['Wayne, Alan S', 'Capitini, Christian M', 'Mackall, Crystal L']","['Wayne AS', 'Capitini CM', 'Mackall CL']","['Pediatric Oncology Branch, Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Building 10, Room #1-3750, 9000 Rockville Pike, MSC 1104, Bethesda, MD 20892-1104, USA. waynea@mail.nih.gov']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural', 'Review']",,United States,Curr Opin Pediatr,Current opinion in pediatrics,9000850,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Cancer Vaccines)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen)', '0 (Receptors, Immunologic)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/immunology', 'Cancer Vaccines', 'Child', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Graft vs Leukemia Effect', 'Humans', 'Immune System/physiology', 'Immunogenetic Phenomena', 'Immunotherapy/*methods', 'Neoplasms/*immunology/*therapy', 'Receptors, Antigen/immunology', 'Receptors, Immunologic/immunology', 'Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",2009/12/03 06:00,2010/03/26 06:00,['2009/12/03 06:00'],"['2009/12/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/12/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/03/26 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1097/MOP.0b013e3283350d3e [doi]'],ppublish,Curr Opin Pediatr. 2010 Feb;22(1):2-11. doi: 10.1097/MOP.0b013e3283350d3e.,22,"['Z01 SC010289-09/ImNIH/Intramural NIH HHS/United States', 'Z01 SC010353-09/ImNIH/Intramural NIH HHS/United States']",,PMC2845444,['NIHMS180981'],90,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Comparison of tamibarotene concentration profiles after oral administration of IT-M-07000 or tamibarotene showed that the plasma tamibarotene concentration increased slower and was retained stable, and the area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) of tamibarotene was larger in mice administered IT-M-07000 than tamibarotene.

Chromosome 6q deletions are also commonly found in lymphoid malignancies such as acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL), chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), non-Hodgkins lymphoma (NHL), multiple myeloma (MM), mantle zone lymphoma (MZL), and Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia (WM). These deletions may appear to be terminal or interstitial. In childhood B- and T-cell ALL a deletion of 6q is the hallmark of a neutral prognosis; however, it may be cytogenetically obscure or cryptic, requiring interphase FISH analysis. In adult ALL it indicates a favorable prognosis, but in CLL, B-cell small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL), WM, and MM it has a poor prognosis. Since the deletion of 6q has prognostic implications and may be used to monitor residual disease, FISH analysis remains a valuable tool in treatment of these disorders.

The present study was designed to investigate the contribution of these two pathways for apoptosis in cancer cells. Lamellarin D promoted nuclear apoptosis in leukemia cells without prominent cell cycle arrest. Signals transmitted by lamellarin D initiated apoptosis via the intrinsic apoptotic pathway. The drug induced conformational activation of Bax and decreased the expression levels of antiapoptotic proteins Bcl-2 and cIAP2 in association with activation of caspase-9 and caspase-3. Upon lamellarin D exposure, Fas and Fas-L expression was not modified in leukemia cells. Moreover, leukemia cells deficient in caspase-8 or Fas-associated protein with death domain underwent apoptosis through the typical mitochondrial apoptotic cascade, indicating that cell death induced by lamellarin D was independent of the extrinsic apoptotic pathway. Lamellarin D also exerted a topoisomerase I-mediated DNA damage response resulting in H2AX phosphorylation, and the upregulation of the DNA repair protein Rad51 and of p53, as well as the phosphorylation of p53 at serine 15. However, lamellarin D killed efficiently mutated p53 or p53 null cancer cells, and sensitivity to lamellarin D was abrogated neither by cycloheximide nor in enucleated cells. Lamellarin D-induced cytochrome c release occurs independently of nuclear factors in a cell-free system. These results suggest that lamellarin D exerts its cytotoxic effects primarily by inducing mitochondrial apoptosis independently of nuclear signaling. Thus, lamellarin D constitutes a new proapoptotic agent that may bypass certain forms of apoptosis resistance that occur in tumor cells.","['Ballot, Caroline', 'Kluza, Jerome', 'Martoriati, Alain', 'Nyman, Ulrika', 'Formstecher, Pierre', 'Joseph, Bertrand', 'Bailly, Christian', 'Marchetti, Philippe']","['Ballot C', 'Kluza J', 'Martoriati A', 'Nyman U', 'Formstecher P', 'Joseph B', 'Bailly C', 'Marchetti P']","['INSERM U 837 Faculte de medecine, 1, place Verdun F- 59045 Lille Cedex France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Mol Cancer Ther,Molecular cancer therapeutics,101132535,"['0 (Coumarins)', '0 (H2AX protein, human)', '0 (Heterocyclic Compounds, 4 or More Rings)', '0 (Histones)', '0 (Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins)', '0 (Isoquinolines)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', '0 (lamellarin D)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (BIRC3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Baculoviral IAP Repeat-Containing 3 Protein)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 9)', 'EC 5.99.1.2 (DNA Topoisomerases, Type I)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects/physiology', 'Baculoviral IAP Repeat-Containing 3 Protein', 'Caspase 3/metabolism', 'Caspase 9/metabolism', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Coumarins/*pharmacology', 'DNA Damage', 'DNA Topoisomerases, Type I/metabolism', 'Flow Cytometry', 'HCT116 Cells', 'Heterocyclic Compounds, 4 or More Rings/*pharmacology', 'Histones/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Immunoblotting', 'Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins/metabolism', 'Isoquinolines/*pharmacology', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Microscopy, Fluorescence', 'Mitochondria/*metabolism', 'Mutation', 'Neoplasms/metabolism/pathology/physiopathology', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/genetics/metabolism', 'Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein/metabolism']",2009/12/03 06:00,2010/03/25 06:00,['2009/12/03 06:00'],"['2009/12/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/12/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/03/25 06:00 [medline]']","['1535-7163.MCT-09-0639 [pii]', '10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-09-0639 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Cancer Ther. 2009 Dec;8(12):3307-17. doi: 10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-09-0639.,8,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Previous studies mostly focused on individual markers and selected disease characteristics, which makes it difficult to estimate the relative value of the novel markers. Therefore, in the present study a comprehensive approach was chosen investigating 18 promising, partly novel expression markers in a well characterized cohort of patients with long clinical follow-up and full genetic information (IGHV status, genomic abnormalities). DESIGN AND METHODS: Expression markers were evaluated using real-time quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction in CD19(+)-purified samples from 151 patients. Multivariate analyses were performed to test the markers' ability to identify patients at genetic risk and as prognostic markers in the context of established prognostic factors. RESULTS: For individual markers, ZAP70 expression provided the highest rate (81%) of correct assignment of patients at genetic risk (IGHV unmutated, V3-21 usage, 11q- or 17p-), followed by LPL and TCF7 (76% both). The assignment rate was improved to 88% by information from a four-gene combination (ZAP70, TCF7, DMD, ATM). In multivariate analysis of treatment-free survival, IGHV mutation status and expression of ADAM29 were of independent prognostic value besides disease stage. With regards to overall survival, expression of ATM, ADAM29, TCL1, and SEPT10 provided prognostic information in addition to that derived from clinical and genetic factors. CONCLUSIONS: Gene expression markers are suitable for screening but not as surrogates for the information from genetic risk factors. While many individual markers may be associated with outcome, only a few are of independent prognostic significance. With regard to prognosis estimation, the genetic prognostic factors cannot be replaced by the expression markers.","['Kienle, Dirk', 'Benner, Axel', 'Laufle, Carolin', 'Winkler, Dirk', 'Schneider, Christof', 'Buhler, Andreas', 'Zenz, Thorsten', 'Habermann, Annett', 'Jager, Ulrich', 'Lichter, Peter', 'Dalla-Favera, Riccardo', 'Dohner, Hartmut', 'Stilgenbauer, Stephan']","['Kienle D', 'Benner A', 'Laufle C', 'Winkler D', 'Schneider C', 'Buhler A', 'Zenz T', 'Habermann A', 'Jager U', 'Lichter P', 'Dalla-Favera R', 'Dohner H', 'Stilgenbauer S']","['Department of Internal Medicine III, University of Ulm, Albert-Einstein-Allee 23, 89081 Ulm, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20091130,Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Genetic Markers)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/genetics', 'Cohort Studies', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/*genetics', 'Genetic Markers/genetics', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/diagnosis/*genetics/*mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'Survival Rate/trends']",2009/12/03 06:00,2011/08/06 06:00,['2009/12/03 06:00'],"['2009/12/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/12/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/08/06 06:00 [medline]']","['haematol.2009.010298 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.2009.010298 [doi]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2010 Jan;95(1):102-9. doi: 10.3324/haematol.2009.010298.

Constitutive PI3K activation is detectable in 50% of acute myeloid leukemia samples whereas mTORC1 is activated in all cases of this disease. In leukemic cells, the PI3K activity relates to the expression of the p110delta isoform of class IA PI3K. Constitutive PI3K activation is the result of autocrine IGF-1/IGF-1R signaling in 70% of acute myeloid leukemia samples but specific inhibition of this pathway does not induce apoptosis. Specific inhibition of PI3K/AKT or mTORC1 alone in vitro has anti-leukemic effects which are essentially exerted via the suppression of proliferation. However, as mTORC1 activation is independent of PI3K/AKT in acute myeloid leukemia, dual PI3K and mTOR inhibitors may induce apoptosis in blast cells. Moreover, mTORC1 inhibition using sirolimus overactivates PI3K/AKT via the upregulation of IRS2 expression and by favoring IGF-1/IGF-1R autocrine signaling. Recent data also indicate that mTORC1 does not control protein translation in acute myeloid leukemia. These results open the way for the design of direct inhibitors of protein synthesis as novel acute myeloid leukemia therapies and also for the development of second generation mTOR inhibitors (the TORKinhibs).","['Park, Sophie', 'Chapuis, Nicolas', 'Tamburini, Jerome', 'Bardet, Valerie', 'Cornillet-Lefebvre, Pascale', 'Willems, Lise', 'Green, Alexa', 'Mayeux, Patrick', 'Lacombe, Catherine', 'Bouscary, Didier']","['Park S', 'Chapuis N', 'Tamburini J', 'Bardet V', 'Cornillet-Lefebvre P', 'Willems L', 'Green A', 'Mayeux P', 'Lacombe C', 'Bouscary D']","[""Institut Cochin, Departement d'Hematologie, CNRS, UMR8104, Paris.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20091130,Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', 'EC 2.7.1.1 (MTOR protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.1.137 (Class I Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.1.137 (PIK3CD protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage', 'Class I Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases', 'Drug Delivery Systems/trends', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/*enzymology', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/*physiology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/antagonists & inhibitors/*physiology', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects/*physiology', 'TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors/*physiology']",2009/12/03 06:00,2011/10/06 06:00,['2009/12/03 06:00'],"['2009/12/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/12/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/10/06 06:00 [medline]']","['haematol.2009.013797 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.2009.013797 [doi]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2010 May;95(5):819-28. doi: 10.3324/haematol.2009.013797.

Although T-cell depletion is increasingly used to reduce the risk of graft-versus-host disease its impact on the graft-versus-leukemia effect and long-term outcome post-transplant is unknown. DESIGN AND METHODS: We have characterized pre- and post-transplant factors determining overall survival in 168 patients with acute myeloid leukemia transplanted using an alemtuzumab based reduced intensity conditioning regimen with a median duration of follow-up of 37 months. RESULTS: The 3-year overall survival for patients transplanted in CR1 or CR2/CR3 was 50% (95% CI, 38% to 62%) and 44% (95% CI, 31% to 56%), respectively compared to 15% (95% CI, 2% to 36%) for patients with relapsed/refractory disease. Multivariate analysis demonstrated that both survival and disease relapse were influenced by status at transplant (P=0.008) and presentation cytogenetics (P=0.01). Increased exposure to cyclosporine A (CsA) in the first 21 days post-transplant was associated with an increased relapse risk (P<0.0001) and decreased overall survival (P<0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: Disease stage, presentation karyotype and post-transplant CsA exposure are important predictors of outcome in patients undergoing a T-cell depleted reduced intensity conditioning allograft for acute myeloid leukemia. These data confirm the presence of a potent graft-versus-leukemia effect after a T-cell depleted reduced intensity conditioning allograft in acute myeloid leukemia and identify CsA exposure as a manipulable determinant of outcome in this setting.","['Craddock, Charles', 'Nagra, Sandeep', 'Peniket, Andrew', 'Brookes, Cassandra', 'Buckley, Laura', 'Nikolousis, Emmanouil', 'Duncan, Nick', 'Tauro, Sudhir', 'Yin, John', 'Liakopoulou, Effie', 'Kottaridis, Panos', 'Snowden, John', 'Milligan, Donald', 'Cook, Gordon', 'Tholouli, Eleni', 'Littlewood, Tim', 'Peggs, Karl', 'Vyas, Paresh', 'Clark, Fiona', 'Cook, Mark', 'Mackinnon, Stephen', 'Russell, Nigel']","['Craddock C', 'Nagra S', 'Peniket A', 'Brookes C', 'Buckley L', 'Nikolousis E', 'Duncan N', 'Tauro S', 'Yin J', 'Liakopoulou E', 'Kottaridis P', 'Snowden J', 'Milligan D', 'Cook G', 'Tholouli E', 'Littlewood T', 'Peggs K', 'Vyas P', 'Clark F', 'Cook M', 'Mackinnon S', 'Russell N']","['Centre for Clinical Haematology, Main Drive, Queen Elizabeth Hospital, Edgbaston, Birmingham B15 2TH, UK. charles.craddock@uhb.nhs.uk']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20091130,Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized)', '0 (Antibodies, Neoplasm)', '3A189DH42V (Alemtuzumab)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Alemtuzumab', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/therapeutic use', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized', 'Antibodies, Neoplasm/therapeutic use', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Graft vs Host Disease/immunology/mortality/prevention & control', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*methods/mortality', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/immunology/mortality/*surgery', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Predictive Value of Tests', '*T-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Time Factors', 'Transplantation Conditioning/*methods/mortality', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Young Adult']",2009/12/03 06:00,2011/08/09 06:00,['2009/12/03 06:00'],"['2009/12/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/12/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/08/09 06:00 [medline]']","['haematol.2009.013920 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.2009.013920 [doi]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2010 Jun;95(6):989-95. doi: 10.3324/haematol.2009.013920.

Propagation of the pluripotent state is stimulated by the cytokine leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) acting through the transcriptional regulator Stat3. Here, we show that this extrinsic stimulus converges with the intrinsic circuitry in Kruppel-factor activation. Oct4 primarily induces Klf2 while LIF/Stat3 selectively enhances Klf4 expression. Overexpression of either factor reduces LIF dependence, but with quantitative and qualitative differences. Unlike Klf4, Klf2 increases ESC clonogenicity, maintains undifferentiated ESCs in the genetic absence of Stat3, and confers resistance to BMP-induced differentiation. ESCs expanded with Klf2 remain capable of contributing to adult chimeras. Postimplantation-embryo-derived EpiSCs lack both Klf2 and Klf4 and expression of either can reinstate naive pluripotency. These findings indicate that Oct4 and Stat3 intersect in directing expression of Klf transcriptional regulators with overlapping properties that additively reinforce ground-state ESC pluripotency, identity, and self-renewal.","['Hall, John', 'Guo, Ge', 'Wray, Jason', 'Eyres, Isobel', 'Nichols, Jennifer', 'Grotewold, Lars', 'Morfopoulou, Sofia', 'Humphreys, Peter', 'Mansfield, William', 'Walker, Rachael', 'Tomlinson, Simon', 'Smith, Austin']","['Hall J', 'Guo G', 'Wray J', 'Eyres I', 'Nichols J', 'Grotewold L', 'Morfopoulou S', 'Humphreys P', 'Mansfield W', 'Walker R', 'Tomlinson S', 'Smith A']","['Wellcome Trust Centre for Stem Cell Research, University of Cambridge, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Cell Stem Cell,Cell stem cell,101311472,"['0 (Bmp4 protein, mouse)', '0 (Bone Morphogenetic Protein 4)', '0 (Gli2 protein, mouse)', '0 (KLF4 protein, human)', '0 (Klf4 protein, mouse)', '0 (Kruppel-Like Factor 4)', '0 (Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', '0 (Octamer Transcription Factor-3)', '0 (Pou5f1 protein, mouse)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Zinc Finger Protein Gli2)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Bone Morphogenetic Protein 4/metabolism', 'Cell Dedifferentiation', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chimera', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental', 'Humans', 'Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells/*metabolism/pathology', 'Kruppel-Like Factor 4', 'Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Microarray Analysis', 'Octamer Transcription Factor-3/*metabolism', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor/genetics/*metabolism', 'Transcriptional Activation', 'Zinc Finger Protein Gli2']",2009/12/03 06:00,2010/06/05 06:00,['2009/12/03 06:00'],"['2009/05/12 00:00 [received]', '2009/09/16 00:00 [revised]', '2009/11/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/12/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/12/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/06/05 06:00 [medline]']","['S1934-5909(09)00576-1 [pii]', '10.1016/j.stem.2009.11.003 [doi]']",ppublish,Cell Stem Cell. 2009 Dec 4;5(6):597-609. doi: 10.1016/j.stem.2009.11.003.,5,"['G0700665/MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom', 'G9806702/MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom', 'WT_/Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom', 'BB_/Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council/United Kingdom']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Gene expression profiles on K562/HHT, K562 and K562/HHT/RU486 (K562/HHT reversed by RU486) cells were detected by DNA microarray. The bone marrow tyrosine kinase gene in chromosome X (BMX) which changed dynamically among the three cells was confirmed by RT-PCR and Western blot. Then, BMX was transfected into K562 and K562/HHT cells, and the changes of daunorubicin (DNR) concentrations in these two cells were observed for BMX overexpression. RESULTS: As compared with K562, there were changes in 117 gene expressions in K562/HHT, 57 of which were up-regulated and 60 down-regulated. The mdrl gene was significantly up-regulated. When compared with K562/HHT, 50 significantly differently expressed genes were screened out in the K562/HHT/RU486 cells, of which up- and down-regulated genes were 13 and 37 respectively. These genes involved in drug resistance, cell signaling, cell differentiation, cell proliferation, transcription regulator, ion transport and so on.

Using yeast surface display, the binding sites of these antibodies were defined to two linear regions on the RBD: S(337-360) and S(380-399). Using these monoclonal antibodies in phage peptide library screening identified 10 distinct mimotopes 12 amino acids in length. Sequence comparison between native epitopes and these mimotopes further confirmed the binding sites, and revealed key amino acid residues involved in antibody binding. None of these antibodies could neutralize the murine leukemia virus pseudotyped expressing the SARS-CoV spike protein (MLV/SARS-CoV).

Early immune responses that allow establishment of the infection are difficult to study without effective animal models. We have developed a cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) assay to monitor the early events of HTLV-1 infection in rabbits. Rabbit skin fibroblast cell lines were established by transformation with a plasmid expressing simian virus 40 (SV40) large T antigen and used as autochthonous targets (derived from same individual animal) to measure CTL activity against HTLV-1 infection in rabbits. Recombinant vaccinia virus (rVV) constructs expressing either HTLV-1 envelope surface unit (SU) glycoprotein 46 or Tax proteins were used to infect fibroblast targets in a (51)Cr-release CTL assay. Rabbits inoculated with Jurkat T cells or ACH.2 cells (expressing ACH HTLV-1 molecule clone) were monitored at 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 13, 21, and 34 wk post-infection. ACH.2-inoculated rabbits were monitored serologically and for viral infected cells following ex vivo culture. Proviral load analysis indicated that rabbits with higher proviral loads had significant CTL activity against HTLV-1 SU as early as 2 wk post-infection, while both low- and high-proviral-load groups had minimal Tax-specific CTL activity throughout the study. This first development of a stringent assay to measure HTLV-1 SU and Tax-specific CTL assay in the rabbit model will enhance immunopathogenesis studies of HTLV-1 infection. Our data suggest that during the early weeks following infection, HTLV-1-specific CTL responses are primarily targeted against Env-SU.","['Haynes, Rashade A H 2nd', 'Phipps, Andrew J', 'Yamamoto, Brenda', 'Green, Patrick', 'Lairmore, Michael D']","['Haynes RA 2nd', 'Phipps AJ', 'Yamamoto B', 'Green P', 'Lairmore MD']","['Center for Retrovirus Research and Department of Veterinary Biosciences, The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio 43210-1093, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",,United States,Viral Immunol,Viral immunology,8801552,"['0 (Gene Products, env)', '0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Retroviridae Proteins, Oncogenic)', '0 (gp46 protein, Human T-cell leukemia virus type I)', '0 (tax protein, Human T-lymphotrophic virus 1)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line, Transformed', 'Cytotoxicity Tests, Immunologic/*methods', 'Female', 'Fibroblasts/virology', 'Gene Products, env/genetics/immunology', 'Gene Products, tax/immunology', 'Genes, pX', 'HTLV-I Infections/*immunology', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*immunology/physiology', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells/immunology', 'Major Histocompatibility Complex/immunology', 'Proviruses/isolation & purification', 'Rabbits', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/immunology', 'Retroviridae Proteins, Oncogenic/genetics/immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/*immunology', 'Time Factors', 'Virus Replication']",2009/12/03 06:00,2010/03/20 06:00,['2009/12/03 06:00'],"['2009/12/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/12/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/03/20 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1089/vim.2009.0059 [doi]'],ppublish,Viral Immunol. 2009 Dec;22(6):397-405. doi: 10.1089/vim.2009.0059.,22,"['P01 CA100730-04S1/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA100730/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 RR014324-05/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA100730-02S1/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA100730-03S1/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA100730-07/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA100730/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,PMC2852241,['NIHMS175831'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: From 1989 to 2004, totally 63 patients with LBL were initially treated with a standard CHOP-based regimen. Forty-two of the 63 patients achieved complete response (CR), 26 of those subsequently received consolidation HDT-HSCT, while the other 16 had 6-8 cycles of standard CHOP-based treatment only. RESULTS: Of the 63 patients, 57 had a T-LBL and 6 B-LBL, with a median age of 20 years, 19 (30.2%) had a stage I-II diseases and 44 (69.8%) stage III-IV diseases, 61.9% presented with a mediastinal mass. Bone marrow involvement presented in 28.6% of the patients. Fourteen percent had central nervous system involvement. The median follow-up period was 24 months, and the estimated 5-year overall survival and disease-free survival of this series was 31.2% and 29.3%, respectively. Of the 42 patients who achieved CR, the 5-year OS rate of the patients who received HDT-HSCT as a consolidation therapy was 59.8% versus 14.6% of the patients treated by CHOP-based regimens alone (P=0.004). Bone marrow involvement, age > or =20 years, short response duration and primary refractory disease were factors significantly associated with poor outcome. Among the 18 patients with bone marrow involvement, 3 received allogeneic HSCT and were all still alive at the follow up time of 22, 32 and 37 months, respectively, while another 4 received auto-HSCT and all died of the disease within 14 months. CONCLUSION: Short term treatment with a CHOP-based regimen is not sufficient for the patients with lymphoblastic lymphoma. High-dose consolidation treatment and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation may improve overall survival and disease free survival. Bone marrow involvement, age >20 years, and short response duration and primary refractory disease are all the factors significantly associated with poor outcome. For the patients with bone marrow involvement, allohematopoietic stem cell transplantation is superior to auto-hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.","['Qin, Yan', 'Shi, Yuan-Kai', 'He, Xiao-Hui', 'Han, Xiao-Hong', 'Zhou, Sheng-Yu', 'Liu, Peng', 'Yang, Jian-Liang', 'Yang, Sheng', 'Zhang, Chang-Gong', 'Dong, Mei', 'Zhou, Li-Qiang', 'Wang, Jin-Wan', 'Feng, Feng-Yi', 'Sun, Yan']","['Qin Y', 'Shi YK', 'He XH', 'Han XH', 'Zhou SY', 'Liu P', 'Yang JL', 'Yang S', 'Zhang CG', 'Dong M', 'Zhou LQ', 'Wang JW', 'Feng FY', 'Sun Y']","['Department of Medical Oncology, Cancer Hospital (Institute), Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, Beijiing 100021, China.']",['chi'],"['Comparative Study', 'English Abstract', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,China,Zhonghua Zhong Liu Za Zhi,Zhonghua zhong liu za zhi [Chinese journal of oncology],7910681,"['5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'VB0R961HZT (Prednisone)', 'CHOP protocol']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Bone Marrow/*pathology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Cyclophosphamide/administration & dosage/therapeutic use', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Doxorubicin/administration & dosage/therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/*therapy', 'Prednisone/administration & dosage/therapeutic use', 'Remission Induction', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Rate', 'Vincristine/administration & dosage/therapeutic use', 'Young Adult']",2009/12/03 06:00,2010/10/22 06:00,['2009/12/03 06:00'],"['2009/12/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/12/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/10/22 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Zhonghua Zhong Liu Za Zhi. 2009 Jun;31(6):469-73.,31,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

After 169,641 person-years (PY) of observation through 2005, 174 solid tumors (exclusive of basal cell carcinomas) and 28 leukemias were ascertained in 195 subjects. Median survival time after a solid SMN diagnosis 5 years or more from WT was 11 years; it was 10 months for all leukemia. Age-specific incidence of secondary solid tumors increased from approximately 1 case per 1,000 PY at age 15 to 5 cases per 1,000 PY at age 40. The cumulative incidence of solid tumors at age 40 for subjects who survived free of SMNs to age 15 was 6.7%. Leukemia risk, by contrast, was highest during the first 5 years after WT diagnosis. Standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) for solid tumors and leukemias were 5.1 and 5.0, respectively. Results for solid tumors for the 3 geographic areas were remarkably consistent; statistical tests for differences in incidence rates and SIRs were all negative. Age-specific incidence rates and SIRs for solid tumors were lower for patients whose WT was diagnosed after 1980, although the trends with decade of diagnosis were not statistically significant. Incidence rates and SIRs for leukemia were highest among those diagnosed after 1990 (p-trend = 0.003). These trends may reflect the decreasing use of radiation therapy and increasing intensity of chemotherapy in modern protocols for treatment of WT.","['Breslow, Norman E', 'Lange, Jane M', 'Friedman, Debra L', 'Green, Daniel M', 'Hawkins, Mike M', 'Murphy, Michael F G', 'Neglia, Joseph P', 'Olsen, Jorgen H', 'Peterson, Susan M', 'Stiller, Charles A', 'Robison, Leslie L']","['Breslow NE', 'Lange JM', 'Friedman DL', 'Green DM', 'Hawkins MM', 'Murphy MF', 'Neglia JP', 'Olsen JH', 'Peterson SM', 'Stiller CA', 'Robison LL']","['Department of Biostatistics, University of Washington, Seattle, WA 98195-7232, USA. norm@u.washington.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Cohort Studies', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Kidney Neoplasms/*complications', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/classification/*complications/pathology', 'Survival Analysis', 'Wilms Tumor/*complications']",2009/12/02 06:00,2010/07/06 06:00,['2009/12/02 06:00'],"['2009/12/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/12/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/07/06 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/ijc.25067 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Cancer. 2010 Aug 1;127(3):657-66. doi: 10.1002/ijc.25067.,127,"['U24 CA055727/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U24 CA55727/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA05449/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA054498/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA054498-18S1/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'DH_/Department of Health/United Kingdom']",,PMC2878923,['NIHMS163799'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As a leading kinase inhibitor, imatinib also provides an excellent model system to investigate how changes in drug design impact biological activity, which is an important consideration for rational drug design. Herein we report a new series of imatinib derivatives that in general have greater activity against the family of PDGF receptors and poorer activity against Abl, as a result of modifications of the phenyl and N-methylpiperazine rings.

D. Anderson Cancer Center experience of 349 patients.,369-76,10.1002/cncr.24775 [doi],"BACKGROUND: The authors evaluated the utility of immunofluorescence staining with an antipromyelocytic leukemia (anti-PML) antibody for patients with a suspected diagnosis of new or relapsed acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) and correlated the findings with the results of other established diagnostic modalities. METHODS: Bone marrow (BM) and/or peripheral blood (PB) smears from 349 patients in whom the diagnosis of APL was considered were assessed with the anti-PML antibody using immunofluorescence. The study group included 199 patients with confirmed APL and 150 with other conditions. The results of conventional cytogenetics, reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) performed on these patients were correlated with the PML results. RESULTS: Among patients with confirmed APL, anti-PML antibody was positive in 182 of 184 BM and 32 of 33 PB smears. Conventional cytogenetics demonstrated t(15;17)(q22;q12) in 166 of 182 (91%) patients; 10 had a normal karyotype, 4 had insufficient mitoses to grow in culture, 1 was inconclusive, and 1 was 48, XX, +8, +8. Anti-PML staining was positive in 9 of 10 with a normal karyotype and in all 4 cases with insufficient mitoses. RT-PCR and FISH were positive for PML-retinoic acid receptor-alpha in 169 of 172 (98%) and 90 of 94 (96%) cases, respectively. Among the patients without APL, 148 of 150 (98.6%) were negative with anti-PML antibody. The sensitivity and specificity of the test were 98.9% and 98.7%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: PML immunofluorescence staining is a rapid (<4 hours turnaround time) and reliable frontline diagnostic approach that can facilitate initiation of targeted therapy, particularly in clinical settings where cytogenetic and molecular testing are not readily available.","['Dimov, Nikolay D', 'Medeiros, L Jeffrey', 'Kantarjian, Hagop M', 'Cortes, Jorge E', 'Chang, Kun-Sang', 'Bueso-Ramos, Carlos E', 'Ravandi, Farhad']","['Dimov ND', 'Medeiros LJ', 'Kantarjian HM', 'Cortes JE', 'Chang KS', 'Bueso-Ramos CE', 'Ravandi F']","['Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas M.

Although a growing number of Western studies have documented the considerable impact of diagnosis and treatment on HRQL in pediatric leukemia survivors, little finding has been reported in non-Western developing countries. METHODS: We used a previously validated 14-dimensional questionnaire, Child Health Questionnaire 50-item Parent Form (CHQ-PF 50), to examine the perceived HRQL of 32 child/adolescent survivors, currently aged 13.17 +/- 2.49 years, who had experienced first complete continuous remission from leukemia for at least 3 years. The HRQL status was compared with that obtained from community subjects (N = 154) and survivors' nonadult siblings (N = 30). Intelligence quotients (IQ) and computerized neuropsychological assessments were performed for subjects. RESULTS: The HRQL of leukemia survivors was noted to be worse than that of community children and nonadult siblings as reflected by significantly lower scores in both the physical summary and the psychosocial summary score of CHQ-PF 50. 15.6% of the survivors had impaired intelligence (estimated IQ below 70). 27.8% of the adolescents were impaired in the cognitive domains as assessed by neuropsychological tests. CONCLUSIONS: In this Taiwanese single institution experience, pediatric leukemia survivors carried a morbidity burden into their teen years as reflected by worse HRQL than controls. These findings may guide the support required by this population.","['Chiou, Shyh-Shin', 'Jang, Ren-Chin', 'Liao, Yu-Mei', 'Yang, Pinchen']","['Chiou SS', 'Jang RC', 'Liao YM', 'Yang P']","['Department of Pediatrics, College of Medicine, Kaohsiung Medical University and Kaohsiung Medical University Hospital, Kaohsiung, Taiwan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20091201,Germany,Support Care Cancer,Supportive care in cancer : official journal of the Multinational Association of Supportive Care in Cancer,9302957,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cognition Disorders/*epidemiology/etiology', 'Combined Modality Therapy/adverse effects', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local/prevention & control', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/complications/epidemiology/*psychology/therapy', 'Quality of Life', 'Sickness Impact Profile', 'Survival Rate', 'Survivors/*psychology', 'Taiwan/epidemiology']",2009/12/02 06:00,2011/03/02 06:00,['2009/12/02 06:00'],"['2009/05/05 00:00 [received]', '2009/11/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/12/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/12/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/03/02 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00520-009-0781-5 [doi]'],ppublish,Support Care Cancer. 2010 Dec;18(12):1581-7. doi: 10.1007/s00520-009-0781-5.

ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters contribute to drug resistance via ATP-dependent drug efflux. P-glycoprotein (Pgp), which is encoded by MDR1 gene, confers resistance to certain anticancer agents. The development of agents able to modulate MDR mediated by Pgp and other ABC transporters remained a major goal for the past 20 years. The calcium blocker verapamil was the first drug shown to be a modulator of Pgp, and since many different chemical compounds have been shown to exert the same effect in vitro by blocking Pgp activity. These included particularly immunosuppressors. Cyclosporin A (CSA) was the first immunosuppressor that have been shown to modulate Pgp activity in laboratory models and entered very early into clinical trials for reversal of MDR. The proof of reversing activity of CSA was found in phase II studies with myeloma and acute leukemia. In phase III studies, the results were less convincing regarding the response rate, progression-free survival, and overall survival, which were detected in advanced refractory myeloma. The non-immunosuppressive derivative PSC833 (valspodar) was subsequently developed. This compound showed tenfold higher potency in reversal of MDR mediated by Pgp. However, pharmacokinetic interactions required reductions in the dose of the concurrently administered anticancer agents. The pharmacokinetic interactions were likely because of decreased clearance of the anticancer agents, possibly as a result of Pgp inhibition in organs such as the gastrointestinal tract and kidney, as well as inhibition of cytochrome P450. Finally, CSA and PSC833 have been shown also to modulate the ceramide metabolism which stands as second messenger of anticancer agent-induced apoptosis. In fact, CSA and PSC833 are also able to respectively inhibit ceramide glycosylation and stimulate de novo ceramide synthesis. This could enhance the cellular level of ceramide and potentiate apoptosis induced by some anticancer agents.","['Morjani, Hamid', 'Madoulet, Claudie']","['Morjani H', 'Madoulet C']","['MEDyC Unite CNRS UMR6237, Reims Pharmacy School, Reims Cedex, France. hamid.morjani@univ-reims.fr']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,Methods Mol Biol,"Methods in molecular biology (Clifton, N.J.)",9214969,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Ceramides)', '0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)', '83HN0GTJ6D (Cyclosporine)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Ceramides/metabolism', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Cyclosporine/chemistry/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Drug Resistance, Multiple/*drug effects', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/drug effects', 'Humans', '*Immunosuppressive Agents/chemistry/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Molecular Structure', 'Neoplasms/drug therapy/metabolism']",2009/12/02 06:00,2010/01/06 06:00,['2009/12/02 06:00'],"['2009/12/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/12/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/01/06 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/978-1-60761-416-6_19 [doi]'],ppublish,Methods Mol Biol. 2010;596:433-46. doi: 10.1007/978-1-60761-416-6_19.,596,,,,,98,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The potential genotoxic properties of PRP-1 and protective effect of PRP-1 against genotoxic action of Mitomycin C (MMC) were analyzed in details in the present work. DNA and chromosome damages were studied in KCL-22 cell line of human myeloid leukemia by the Comet assay and micronucleus induction test, respectively. The results suggest that DNA damages are, at least partly, transient and reparable. PRP-1 at the doses 0.5-2.0 microg/ml does not possess genotoxic activity. Moreover, this peptide expresses both preventive and therapeutic effects against MMC-induced DNA damage. Pre-treatment of cells with PRP-1 also prevents the appearance of daughter cells bearing as heavy MMC-induced DNA/chromosome damages as MNs. Thus, the polypeptide studied is able to protect the cells from genotoxic action of MMC. This defense includes not only DNA but also heritable chromosome damage in post-mitotic cells. Possible mechanisms of PRP-1 protective action are discussed.","['Aroutiounian, R M', 'Hovhannisyan, G G', 'Gasparyan, G H', 'Margaryan, K S', 'Aroutiounian, D N', 'Sarkissyan, N K', 'Galoyan, A A']","['Aroutiounian RM', 'Hovhannisyan GG', 'Gasparyan GH', 'Margaryan KS', 'Aroutiounian DN', 'Sarkissyan NK', 'Galoyan AA']","['Yerevan State University, Yerevan, Armenia. genetik@ysu.am']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20091201,United States,Neurochem Res,Neurochemical research,7613461,"['0 (Antimutagenic Agents)', '0 (Mutagens)', '0 (Peptides)', '0 (proline-rich polypeptide-1, Bos taurus)', '50SG953SK6 (Mitomycin)']",IM,"['Antimutagenic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Comet Assay', 'DNA Damage', 'Humans', 'Micronucleus Tests', 'Mitomycin/*toxicity', 'Mutagens/*toxicity', 'Peptides/*pharmacology']",2009/12/02 06:00,2010/08/03 06:00,['2009/12/02 06:00'],"['2009/11/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/12/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/12/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/08/03 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s11064-009-0104-8 [doi]'],ppublish,Neurochem Res. 2010 Apr;35(4):598-602. doi: 10.1007/s11064-009-0104-8.

Various conditioning regimens differ in their myeloablative and immunosuppressive intensity. Regardless of the type of conditioning regimen, graft-versus- host disease (GVHD) in NST occurs almost equally in CST, although a slightly delayed development of acute GVHD is observed in NST. Although graft-versus-hematological malignancy effects (i.e., graft-versus-leukemia effect, graft-versus-lymphoma effect, and graft-versus-myeloma effect) also occur in NST, completely eradicating residual malignant cells through allogeneic immune responses is insufficient in cases with rapidly growing disease or uncontrolled progressive disease. Donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI) is sometimes combined to support engraftment and to augment the graft-versus-hematological malignancy effect, such as the graft-versus-leukemia effect. DLI is especially effective for controlling relapse in the chronic phase of chronic myelogenous leukemia, but not so effective against other diseases. Indeed, NST is a beneficial procedure for expanding the opportunity of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation to many patients with hematological malignancies. However, a more sophisticated improvement in separating graft-versus-hematological malignancy effects from GVHD is required in the future.","['Imamura, Masahiro', 'Tanaka, Junji']","['Imamura M', 'Tanaka J']","['Department of Hematology and Oncology, Hokkaido University Graduate School of Medicine, Kita-ku, Sapporo, Japan. mimamura@med.hokudai.ac.jp']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20091127,Korea (South),Korean J Intern Med,The Korean journal of internal medicine,8712418,,IM,"['Antigen-Presenting Cells/physiology', 'Graft vs Host Disease/etiology', '*Graft vs Leukemia Effect', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*adverse effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/therapy', 'Lymphocyte Transfusion', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/therapy', 'Multiple Myeloma/therapy', '*Transplantation Conditioning']",2009/12/02 06:00,2010/01/06 06:00,['2009/12/02 06:00'],"['2009/12/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/12/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/01/06 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3904/kjim.2009.24.4.287 [doi]'],ppublish,Korean J Intern Med. 2009 Dec;24(4):287-98. doi: 10.3904/kjim.2009.24.4.287.

Methyl esterification and switching a keto group from position C(11) to C(12) significantly increased the antiproliferative effects. CDODO-Me-11 and CDODO-Me-12 were 10-fold more potent than their non-esters, respectively. CDODO-Me-12 was 10-fold more effective than CDODO-Me-11 in inducing apoptosis which was correlated with the activation of caspase-8 and caspase-9. Western blot analyses revealed that CDODO-Me-12 and CDODO-Me-11 downregulated the levels of anti-apoptosis proteins, c-FLIP, XIAP and Mcl-1, without altering the protein levels of Bcl-2 and the death receptors DR4 and DR5. Both agents decreased the levels of the mitochondrial membrane potential without altering the intracellular H(2)O(2) levels. Jurkat cells without expression of caspase-8 were not sensitive to CDODO-Me-12, but were somewhat responsive to CDODO-Me-11. K562 cells with higher intracellular reduced glutathione (GSH ) levels were less responsive to CDODO-Me-12 apoptosis induction than U937 cells even though both cell lines were equally sensitive to CDODO-Me-11 apoptosis induction. Both agents depleted intracellular GSH levels and exogenous GSH reversed apoptosis induction by either agent in HL-60 cells. N-acetylcysteine (NAC) significantly attenuated apoptosis induction by CDODO-Me-12, but only weakly, that by CDODO-Me-11. UV spectrophotometric analysis revealed that both agents interacted with GSH while only CDODO-Me-12 had high reactivity with NAC. These data suggest that both agents induce apoptosis requiring to bind to functional proteins with thiol groups and that GSH may play a protective role by forming inactive adducts with them.","['Song, Dandan', 'Gao, Yuan', 'Wang, Rui', 'Liu, Dan', 'Zhao, Linxiang', 'Jing, Yongkui']","['Song D', 'Gao Y', 'Wang R', 'Liu D', 'Zhao L', 'Jing Y']","['Department of Pharmacology, Shenyang Pharmaceutical University, Shenyang, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100109,United States,Cancer Biol Ther,Cancer biology & therapy,101137842,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (CASP8 and FADD-Like Apoptosis Regulating Protein)', '0 (CFLAR protein, human)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (X-Linked Inhibitor of Apoptosis Protein)', '0 (XIAP protein, human)', '0 (methyl 2-cyano-3,11-dioxooleana-1,12-dien-30-oate)', '0 (methyl 2-cyano-3,12-dioxooleana-1, 12-dien-30-oate)', 'GAN16C9B8O (Glutathione)', 'P540XA09DR (Glycyrrhetinic Acid)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*genetics', 'CASP8 and FADD-Like Apoptosis Regulating Protein/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Down-Regulation', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/*drug effects', 'Glutathione/*metabolism', 'Glycyrrhetinic Acid/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'HL-60 Cells/drug effects/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells/drug effects/metabolism', 'K562 Cells/drug effects/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*pathology', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Oxidation-Reduction', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'U937 Cells/drug effects/metabolism', 'X-Linked Inhibitor of Apoptosis Protein/*biosynthesis/genetics']",2009/12/02 06:00,2010/08/26 06:00,['2009/12/02 06:00'],"['2009/12/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/12/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/08/26 06:00 [medline]']","['10287 [pii]', '10.4161/cbt.9.2.10287 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Biol Ther. 2010 Jan;9(2):96-108. doi: 10.4161/cbt.9.2.10287.

Complementarity between primers and template is often crucial for PCR applications, as mismatches can severely reduce priming efficiency. However, little quantitative data on the effect of these mismatches is available. We quantitatively investigated the effects of primer-template mismatches within the 3'-end primer region on real-time PCR using the 5'-nuclease assay. Our results show that single mismatches instigate a broad variety of effects, ranging from minor (<1.5 cycle threshold, eg, A-C, C-A, T-G, G-T) to severe impact (>7.0 cycle threshold, eg, A-A, G-A, A-G, C-C) on PCR amplification. A clear relationship between specific mismatch types, position, and impact was found, which remained consistent for DNA versus RNA amplifications and Taq/Moloney murine leukemia virus versus rTth based amplifications. The overall size of the impact among the various master mixes used differed substantially (up to sevenfold), and for certain master mixes a reverse or forward primer-specific impact was observed, emphasizing the importance of the experimental conditions used. Taken together these data suggest that mismatch impact follows a consistent pattern and enabled us to formulate several guidelines for predicting primer-template mismatch behavior when using specific 5-nuclease assay master mixes. Our study provides novel insight into mismatch behavior and should allow for more optimized development of real-time PCR assays involving primer-template mismatches.","['Stadhouders, Ralph', 'Pas, Suzan D', 'Anber, Jeer', 'Voermans, Jolanda', 'Mes, Ted H M', 'Schutten, Martin']","['Stadhouders R', 'Pas SD', 'Anber J', 'Voermans J', 'Mes TH', 'Schutten M']","['Department of Virology, Erasmus University Medical Centre, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20091130,United States,J Mol Diagn,The Journal of molecular diagnostics : JMD,100893612,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (Nucleic Acids)']",IM,"['*Base Pair Mismatch', 'DNA Primers/*genetics', 'Nucleic Acids/*analysis/genetics', 'Pathology, Molecular', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction/*methods']",2009/12/02 06:00,2010/03/11 06:00,['2009/12/02 06:00'],"['2009/12/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/12/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/03/11 06:00 [medline]']","['S1525-1578(10)60036-0 [pii]', '10.2353/jmoldx.2010.090035 [doi]']",ppublish,J Mol Diagn. 2010 Jan;12(1):109-17. doi: 10.2353/jmoldx.2010.090035.

We show that the principal anti-apoptotic mechanism of both BCL-2 and MCL-1 in these leukemias is to sequester pro-death BH3-only proteins rather than BAX and BAK. We find that the MCL-1-dependent leukemias are more sensitive to a wide range of chemotherapeutic agents acting by disparate mechanisms. In common across these varied treatments is that MCL-1 protein levels rapidly decrease in a proteosome-dependent fashion, whereas those of BCL-2 are stable.

The addition of rabbit antithymocyte globulin (ATG) may reduce morbidity and mortality from graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), but lead to increased relapse. To compensate for this effect, we added 400 cGy of total body irradiation (TBI) to the Flu/Bu regimen in 89 patients, and compared outcomes with those achieved in 90 patients who received the drug combination alone. Although nonrelapse mortality (NRM) at 3 years did not differ between the groups, the inclusion of TBI significantly reduced relapse (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.29; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.15-0.54; P = .0001). Consequently, both overall survival (OS; HR = 0.50; 95% CI = 0.3-0.84; P = .009) and disease-free survival (DFS; HR = 0.43; 95% CI = 0.26-0.72; P = .001) were improved with the inclusion of TBI. This study confirms the importance of regimen intensity in allogeneic HSCT for AML. The combination of daily i.v.

Novel immune-based therapies that target pediatric malignancies offer attractive adjuncts and/or alternatives to commonly employed cytotoxic regimens of chemotherapy or radiotherapy. Elucidation of the principles of tumor biology and the development of novel laboratory technologies over the last decade have led to substantial progress in bringing immunotherapies to the bedside. AREAS COVERED IN THIS REVIEW: Current immunotherapeutic clinical trials in pediatric oncology and the science behind their development are reviewed. WHAT THE READER WILL GAIN: Most of the immune-based therapies studied to date have been well tolerated, and some have shown promise in the setting of refractory or high-risk malignancies, demonstrating that immunotherapy has the potential to overcome resistance to conventional chemotherapy. TAKE HOME MESSAGE: Some immune-based therapies, such as ch14.18 and MTP-PE, have already been proven effective in phase III randomized trials. Further studies are needed to optimize and integrate other therapies into standard regimens, and to test them in randomized trials for patients with childhood cancer.","['Capitini, Christian M', 'Mackall, Crystal L', 'Wayne, Alan S']","['Capitini CM', 'Mackall CL', 'Wayne AS']","['National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Center for Cancer Research, Pediatric Oncology Branch, 10 Center Drive, MSC 1104, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA. capitinic@mail.nih.gov']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural', 'Review']",,England,Expert Opin Biol Ther,Expert opinion on biological therapy,101125414,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Cancer Vaccines)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/therapeutic use', 'Cancer Vaccines/therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Cytokines/physiology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Immunity, Cellular/physiology', 'Immunity, Innate/drug effects', '*Immunotherapy', 'Immunotherapy, Adoptive', 'Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/physiology', 'Leukemia/therapy', 'Neoplasms/*therapy']",2009/12/02 06:00,2010/04/07 06:00,['2009/12/02 06:00'],"['2009/12/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/12/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/04/07 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1517/14712590903431022 [doi]'],ppublish,Expert Opin Biol Ther. 2010 Feb;10(2):163-78. doi: 10.1517/14712590903431022.,10,['Z99 CA999999/ImNIH/Intramural NIH HHS/United States'],,PMC2809805,['NIHMS158541'],123,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we present long-term follow-up data of animals that received lentivirus-transduced CD34-enriched cells. Six long-term surviving dogs were available for analysis. Transgene expression was analyzed from at least 12 months to more than 5 years after transplantation in peripheral blood cells and multiple cell lineages. All animals demonstrated long-term stable transgene expression in peripheral blood myeloid, lymphoid, and red blood cells as well as in platelets. Vector integration sites were analyzed by linear amplification-mediated polymerase chain reaction and showed a polyclonal repopulation pattern in all animals. There was no evidence of any development of monoclonality or leukemia in the animals. The stable long-term multilineage transgene expression, together with detection of the same integration site in myeloid and lymphoid cells, strongly suggests the transduction of long-term repopulating stem cells. Our data demonstrate safe and efficient transduction of multilineage long-term repopulating cells with lentiviral vectors and support the use of such vectors for gene therapy studies in patients.","['Enssle, Joerg', 'Trobridge, Grant D', 'Keyser, Kirsten A', 'Ironside, Christina', 'Beard, Brian C', 'Kiem, Hans-Peter']","['Enssle J', 'Trobridge GD', 'Keyser KA', 'Ironside C', 'Beard BC', 'Kiem HP']","['Clinical Research Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA 98109, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",,United States,Hum Gene Ther,Human gene therapy,9008950,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Bacterial Proteins)', '0 (Luminescent Proteins)', '0 (yellow fluorescent protein, Bacteria)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, CD34/genetics/metabolism', 'Bacterial Proteins/genetics/metabolism', '*Cell Lineage/genetics/physiology', 'Dogs', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Genetic Therapy/*methods', 'Genetic Vectors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*cytology/metabolism', 'Lentivirus/genetics/*metabolism', 'Luminescent Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Time Factors', '*Transduction, Genetic', 'Transgenes/genetics/*physiology']",2009/12/02 06:00,2010/07/28 06:00,['2009/12/02 06:00'],"['2009/12/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/12/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/07/28 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1089/hum.2009.076 [doi]'],ppublish,Hum Gene Ther. 2010 Apr;21(4):397-403. doi: 10.1089/hum.2009.076.,21,"['DK47754/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'HL200010/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL36444/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'KD56465/PHS HHS/United States']",['Hum Gene Ther. 2010 Apr;21(4):365-7.

The development of P-glycoprotein inhibitors could be effective to reverse multidrug resistance. The aim of this study was to observe the effects of guggulsterone, the active component of gugulipid, on multidrug resistance in doxorubicin-resistant K562 cells (K562/DOX) and the parental K562 cells. Its cytotoxicity and reversal effects on multidrug resistance were assessed by MTT (3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) assay. Apoptosis percentage of cells was obtained from Annexin V/fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) and propridium iodide (PI) double staining. The effects of guggulsterone on P-glycoprotein activity were evaluated by measuring rhodamine 123 (Rh123)-associated mean fluorescence intensity and P-glycoprotein expression on the basis of the flow cytometric technology, respectively. The results showed that guggulsterone up to 100 microM had little cytotoxicity against K562/DOX cells. When combined with doxorubicin, it significantly promoted the sensitivity of K562/DOX cells toward doxorubicin through increasing intracellular accumulation of doxorubicin in a dose-dependent manner. Further study demonstrated that the inhibitory effect of guggulsterone on P-glycoprotein activity was the major cause of increased stagnation of doxorubicin inside K562/DOX cells, indicating that guggulsterone may effectively reverse multidrug resistance in K562/DOX cells via inhibiting expression and drug-transport function of P-glycoprotein.","['Xu, Hong-Bin', 'Li, Ling', 'Liu, Guo-Qing']","['Xu HB', 'Li L', 'Liu GQ']","[""Department of Pharmacy, Tenth People's Hospital, Tongji University, Shanghai, China. jiangruihua119@yahoo.cn""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Germany,Pharmazie,Die Pharmazie,9800766,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B)', '0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Calcium Channel Blockers)', '0 (Fluorescent Dyes)', '0 (Pregnenediones)', '1N3CZ14C5O (Rhodamine 123)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', 'A4PW148END (pregna-4,17-diene-3,16-dione)', 'CJ0O37KU29 (Verapamil)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B/*antagonists & inhibitors/*chemistry/metabolism', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Calcium Channel Blockers/pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Doxorubicin/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance, Multiple/*drug effects', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*drug effects', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Fluorescent Dyes', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Pregnenediones/*pharmacology', 'Rhodamine 123', 'Verapamil/pharmacology']",2009/12/02 06:00,2010/01/22 06:00,['2009/12/02 06:00'],"['2009/12/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/12/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/01/22 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Pharmazie. 2009 Oct;64(10):660-5.,64,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The disease may be detected by a dentist since oral signs are often the initial manifestation. However, despite several cases describing oral manifestations of acute promyelocytic leukaemia and genetic analysis, reports of acute promyelocytic leukaemia in Hispanic populations are scarce. The identification of third molar pain as an initial clinical manifestation is also uncommon. This is the first known case involving these particular features. CASE PRESENTATION: A 24-year-old Latin American man without relevant antecedents consulted a dentist for pain in his third molar. After two dental extractions, the patient experienced increased pain, poor healing, jaw enlargement and bleeding. A physical examination later revealed that the patient had pallor, jaw enlargement, ecchymoses and gingival haemorrhage. Laboratory findings showed pancytopaenia, delayed coagulation times, hypoalbuminaemia and elevated lactate dehydrogenase. Splenomegaly was detected on ultrasonography. Peripheral blood and bone marrow analyses revealed a hypercellular infiltrate of atypical promyelocytic cells. Cytogenetic analysis showing genetic translocation t(15;17) further confirmed acute promyelocytic leukaemia. Despite early chemotherapy, the patient died within one week due to intracranial bleeding secondary to disseminated intravascular coagulation. CONCLUSION: The description of this unusual presentation of acute promyelocytic leukaemia, the diagnostic difficulties and the fatal outcome are particularly directed toward dental surgery practitioners to emphasise the importance of clinical assessment and preoperative evaluation as a minimal clinically-oriented routine. This case may also be of particular interest to haematologists, since the patient's cytogenetic analysis, clinical course and therapeutic response are well documented.","['Suarez-Cuenca, Juan A', 'Arellano-Sanchez, Jose L', 'Scherling-Ocampo, Aldo A', 'Sanchez-Hernandez, Gerardo', 'Perez-Guevara, David', 'Chalapud-Revelo, Juan R']","['Suarez-Cuenca JA', 'Arellano-Sanchez JL', 'Scherling-Ocampo AA', 'Sanchez-Hernandez G', 'Perez-Guevara D', 'Chalapud-Revelo JR']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Ticoman General Hospital, SSDF Mexico City, Mexico.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20091103,England,J Med Case Rep,Journal of medical case reports,101293382,,,,2009/12/01 06:00,2009/12/01 06:01,['2009/12/01 06:00'],"['2008/10/18 00:00 [received]', '2009/11/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/12/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/12/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2009/12/01 06:01 [medline]']",['10.1186/1752-1947-3-102 [doi]'],epublish,J Med Case Rep. 2009 Nov 3;3:102. doi: 10.1186/1752-1947-3-102.,3,,,PMC2783043,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although this infection frequently involves the lung parenchyma, it is unusual to find it limited to the tracheobronchial tree, a condition known as invasive aspergillus tracheobronchitis. CASE PRESENTATION: A 65 year-old Hispanic man from Bolivia with a history of chronic lymphocytic leukemia developed cough and malaise eight months after having an allogenic stem cell transplant. A computed tomography of the chest revealed an area of diffuse soft tissue thickening around the left main stem bronchus, which was intensely fluorodeoxyglucose-avid on positron emission tomography scanning. An initial bronchoscopic exam revealed circumferential narrowing of the entire left main stem bronchus with necrotic and friable material on the medial wall. Neither aspirates from this necrotic area nor bronchial washing were diagnostic. A second bronchoscopy with endobronchial ultrasound evidenced a soft tissue thickening on the medial aspect of the left main stem bronchus underlying the area of necrosis visible endoluminally. Endobronchial ultrasound-guided transbronchial needle aspiration performed in this area revealed multiple fungal elements suggestive of Aspergillus species. CONCLUSION: We describe the first case of invasive aspergillus tracheobronchitis in which the diagnosis was facilitated by the use of endobronchial ultrasound guided trans-bronchial needle aspiration. To the best of our knowledge, we are also presenting the first positron emission tomography scan images of this condition in the literature. We cautiously suggest that endobronchial ultrasound imaging may be a useful tool to evaluate the degree of invasion and the involvement of vascular structures in these patients prior to bronchoscopic manipulation of the affected areas in an effort to avoid potentially fatal hemorrhage.","['Casal, Roberto F', 'Adachi, Roberto', 'Jimenez, Carlos A', 'Sarkiss, Mona', 'Morice, Rodolfo C', 'Eapen, Georgie A']","['Casal RF', 'Adachi R', 'Jimenez CA', 'Sarkiss M', 'Morice RC', 'Eapen GA']","['Department of Pulmonary Medicine, The University of Texas M.

Anti-tumoral, anti-inflammatory and anti-angiogenesis effects of propranolol (a non-selective beta-adrenergic blocker) have been shown. Angiogenesis (replenish of the pre-existing vascular networks) plays a critical role in some pathological conditions such as tumor expansion and metastasis. In this study, we investigated the effects of propranolol on vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) production and matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) activity (two important angiogenic factors) in human leukemic cell lines in vitro. METHODS: Two human leukemic T (Molt-4 and Jurkat) and one monocyte (U937) cell lines were used in this study. The cells were cultured in complete RPMI medium and then incubated with different concentrations of propranolol (0.3-30 microM) in the presence or absence of phorbol myristate acetate (PMA, 25 ng/ml) for 48 hours. The level of VEGF secreted in the cell culture supernatants was measured with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kits (R and D systems) and MMP-2 activity in cell-conditioned media was evaluated by gelatin zymography. RESULTS: Propranolol significantly decreased VEGF production and also MMP-2 activity in PMA-activated human leukemic cell lines Molt-4, Jurkat and U937 at 30 microM concentration of the drug compared to untreated control cells (P<0.05). CONCLUSION: Propranolol might be a useful anti-angiogenic agent in hematopoietic malignancies. Thus, propranolol along with its chronic long-term usage in cardiac problems may have potential implication in treatment of leukemia.","['Hajighasemi, Fatemeh', 'Hajighasemi, Sakineh']","['Hajighasemi F', 'Hajighasemi S']","['Dept. of Immunology, Faculty of Medicine, Shahed University, Tehran, Iran.', 'Mostafa Khomeini Hospital, Shahed University, Tehran, Iran.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",,Iran,Iran Biomed J,Iranian biomedical journal,9814853,"['0 (Adrenergic beta-Antagonists)', '0 (Carcinogens)', '0 (VEGFA protein, human)', '0 (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A)', '9Y8NXQ24VQ (Propranolol)', 'EC 3.4.24.24 (Matrix Metalloproteinase 2)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Adrenergic beta-Antagonists/*pharmacology', 'Carcinogens/pharmacology', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Leukemia/drug therapy', 'Matrix Metalloproteinase 2/*metabolism', 'Monocytes/cytology/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Neovascularization, Pathologic/drug therapy', 'Propranolol/*pharmacology', 'T-Lymphocytes/cytology/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'U937 Cells', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A/*metabolism']",2009/12/01 06:00,2010/05/28 06:00,['2009/12/01 06:00'],"['2009/12/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/12/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/05/28 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Iran Biomed J. 2009 Oct;13(4):223-8.,13,,,,,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Propranolo', 'Angiogenesis', 'Vascular endothelial growth factor', 'Matrix metalloproteinase-2', 'Leukemia']",,,,,,,,,,,

Most MBL share phenotypic characteristics with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Although some MBL progress to CLL, most MBL have apparently limited potential for progression to CLL, particularly those MBL with normal absolute B-cell counts ('low-count' MBL). Most CLL are monoclonal and it is not known whether MBL are monoclonal or oligoclonal; this is important because it is unclear whether MBL represent indolent CLL or represent a distinct premalignant precursor before the development of CLL. We used flow cytometry analysis and sorting to determine immunophenotypic characteristics, clonality and molecular features of MBL from familial CLL kindreds. Single-cell analysis indicated four of six low-count MBL consisted of two or more unrelated clones; the other two MBL were monoclonal. 87% of low-count MBL clones had mutated immunoglobulin genes, and no immunoglobulin heavy-chain rearrangements of V(H) family 1 were observed. Some MBL were diversified, clonally related populations with evidence of antigen drive. We conclude that although low-count MBL share many phenotypic characteristics with CLL, many MBL are oligoclonal. This supports a model for step-wise development of MBL into CLL.","['Lanasa, M C', 'Allgood, S D', 'Volkheimer, A D', 'Gockerman, J P', 'Whitesides, J F', 'Goodman, B K', 'Moore, J O', 'Weinberg, J B', 'Levesque, M C']","['Lanasa MC', 'Allgood SD', 'Volkheimer AD', 'Gockerman JP', 'Whitesides JF', 'Goodman BK', 'Moore JO', 'Weinberg JB', 'Levesque MC']","['Department of Medicine, Duke University Medical Center, 1 Trent Drive, Morris Building Room 25153, Durham, NC 27710, USA. mark.lanasa@duke.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20091015,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Variable Region)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'B-Lymphocytes/*pathology', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'Female', 'Genes, Immunoglobulin', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/genetics', 'Immunoglobulin Variable Region/genetics', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/genetics/*immunology', 'Lymphocytosis/genetics/*immunology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged']",2009/12/01 06:00,2010/01/28 06:00,['2009/12/01 06:00'],"['2009/12/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/12/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/01/28 06:00 [medline]']","['leu2009192 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2009.192 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2010 Jan;24(1):133-40. doi: 10.1038/leu.2009.192.

Current trials are combining FLT3 inhibitors with p53-activating conventional chemotherapy. The mechanisms of cytotoxicity of FLT3 inhibitors are poorly understood. We investigated the interaction of FLT3 and p53 pathways after their simultaneous blockade using the selective FLT3 inhibitor FI-700 and the MDM2 inhibitor Nutlin-3 in AML. We found that FI-700 immediately reduced antiapoptotic Mcl-1 levels and enhanced Nutlin-induced p53-mediated mitochondrial apoptosis in FLT3/internal tandem duplication cells through the Mcl-1/Noxa axis. FI-700 induced proteasome-mediated degradation of Mcl-1, resulting in the reduced ability of Mcl-1 to sequester proapoptotic Bim. Nutlin-3 induced Noxa, which displaced Bim from Mcl-1. The FI-700/Nutlin-3 combination profoundly activated Bax and induced apoptosis. Our findings suggest that FI-700 actively enhances p53 signaling toward mitochondrial apoptosis and that a combination strategy aimed at inhibiting FLT3 and activating p53 signaling could potentially be effective in AML.","['Kojima, K', 'Konopleva, M', 'Tsao, T', 'Andreeff, M', 'Ishida, H', 'Shiotsu, Y', 'Jin, L', 'Tabe, Y', 'Nakakuma, H']","['Kojima K', 'Konopleva M', 'Tsao T', 'Andreeff M', 'Ishida H', 'Shiotsu Y', 'Jin L', 'Tabe Y', 'Nakakuma H']","['Department of Hematology/Oncology, Wakayama Medical University, 811-1 Kimiidera, Wakayama 641-8510, Japan. k-koji@wakayama-med.ac.jp']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20091015,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (BAX protein, human)', '0 (FI-700)', '0 (Imidazoles)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (PMAIP1 protein, human)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Pyridines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', '53IA0V845C (nutlin 3)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)', 'EC 3.4.25.1 (Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Doxorubicin/pharmacology', 'G1 Phase/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Imidazoles/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/genetics/pathology', '*Mutation', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Piperazines/pharmacology', 'Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex/physiology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*antagonists & inhibitors/*physiology', 'Pyridines/*pharmacology', 'Pyrimidines/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/*physiology', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein/metabolism', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/antagonists & inhibitors/*genetics']",2009/12/01 06:00,2010/01/28 06:00,['2009/12/01 06:00'],"['2009/12/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/12/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/01/28 06:00 [medline]']","['leu2009212 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2009.212 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2010 Jan;24(1):33-43. doi: 10.1038/leu.2009.212.

There are three Bcr-Abl chimeras known so far, p190, p210 and p230. The only structural difference between the three Bcr-Abl proteins is the presence of DH and PH domains from the Bcr gene in p210 and p230. The Bcr-Abl DH domain is functioning as a guanine nucleotide exchange factor for Rho family of small GTPases. The PH domain confers binding to phosphoinositides but some PH domains have also been found to bind specific target proteins. Here we show that the PH domain from Bcr-Abl binds a number of proteins involved in vital cellular processes. These proteins include PLCvarepsilon, Zizimin1, tubulin and SMC1. The revelation of the role of the Bcr-Abl PH domain in leukemogenesis is likely to provide clues to the molecular mechanisms underlying the phenotypes of Bcr-Abl positive leukemia and could therefore provide tools for the identification of targets for the development of therapeutic treatments.","['Miroshnychenko, Daria', 'Dubrovska, Anna', 'Maliuta, Stanislav', 'Telegeev, Gennady', 'Aspenstrom, Pontus']","['Miroshnychenko D', 'Dubrovska A', 'Maliuta S', 'Telegeev G', 'Aspenstrom P']","['Institute of Molecular Biology and Genetics NAS of Ukraine, Zabolotnogo str, 150 Kyiv 03143, Ukraine.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20091126,United States,Exp Cell Res,Experimental cell research,0373226,"['0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (PHIP protein, human)', '0 (Phosphatidylinositols)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Biomarkers', 'COS Cells', 'Cell Line', 'Chlorocebus aethiops', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'Genes, abl/genetics/*physiology', 'Humans', '*Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/genetics/physiology', 'K562 Cells', 'Microscopy, Fluorescence', 'Phosphatidylinositols/*metabolism', 'Protein Binding', 'Proteomics', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Signal Transduction']",2009/12/01 06:00,2010/03/03 06:00,['2009/12/01 06:00'],"['2009/05/20 00:00 [received]', '2009/11/17 00:00 [revised]', '2009/11/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/12/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/12/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/03/03 06:00 [medline]']","['S0014-4827(09)00513-8 [pii]', '10.1016/j.yexcr.2009.11.014 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Cell Res. 2010 Feb 15;316(4):530-42. doi: 10.1016/j.yexcr.2009.11.014.

In addition, RES has been reported to inhibit tumorigenesis in several animal models suggesting that it functions as a chemopreventive and anti-tumor agent in vivo. The chemopreventive and chemotherapeutic properties associated with resveratrol offer promise for the design of new chemotherapeutic agents. However, the mechanisms by which RES mediates its effects are not yet fully understood. In this study, we showed that RES caused cell cycle arrest and proliferation inhibition via induction of unfolded protein response (UPR) in human leukemia K562 cell line. Treatment of K562 cells with RES induced a number of signature UPR markers, including transcriptional induction of GRP78 and CHOP, phosphorylation of eukaryotic initiation factor 2alpha (eIF2alpha), ER stress-specific XBP-1 splicing, suggesting the induction of UPR by RES. RES inhibited proliferation of K562 in a concentration-dependent manner. Flow cytometric analyses revealed that K562 cells were arrested in G1 phase upon RES treatment. Salubrinal, an eIF2alpha inhibitor, or overexpression of dominant negative mutants of PERK or eIF2alpha, effectively restored RES-induced cell cycle arrest, underscoring the important role of PERK/eIF2alpha branch of UPR in RES-induced inhibition of cell proliferation.","['Liu, Bao-Qin', 'Gao, Yan-Yan', 'Niu, Xiao-Fang', 'Xie, Ji-Sheng', 'Meng, Xin', 'Guan, Yifu', 'Wang, Hua-Qin']","['Liu BQ', 'Gao YY', 'Niu XF', 'Xie JS', 'Meng X', 'Guan Y', 'Wang HQ']","['Department of Biochemistry & Molecular Biology, China Medical University, Shenyang 110001, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20091126,United States,Biochem Biophys Res Commun,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,0372516,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (DDIT3 protein, human)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Endoplasmic Reticulum Chaperone BiP)', '0 (Eukaryotic Initiation Factor-2)', '0 (HSPA5 protein, human)', '0 (Heat-Shock Proteins)', '0 (Regulatory Factor X Transcription Factors)', '0 (Stilbenes)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (X-Box Binding Protein 1)', '0 (XBP1 protein, human)', '147336-12-7 (Transcription Factor CHOP)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (PERK kinase)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (eIF-2 Kinase)', 'Q369O8926L (Resveratrol)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', '*Apoptosis', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/*drug effects', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Endoplasmic Reticulum Chaperone BiP', 'Eukaryotic Initiation Factor-2/genetics/metabolism', 'Heat-Shock Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', '*Protein Folding', 'Protein Splicing', 'Regulatory Factor X Transcription Factors', 'Resveratrol', 'Stilbenes/*pharmacology', 'Transcription Factor CHOP/genetics/metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/metabolism', 'X-Box Binding Protein 1', 'eIF-2 Kinase/genetics/metabolism']",2009/12/01 06:00,2010/03/17 06:00,['2009/12/01 06:00'],"['2009/11/21 00:00 [received]', '2009/11/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/12/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/12/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/03/17 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-291X(09)02333-X [pii]', '10.1016/j.bbrc.2009.11.137 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Biophys Res Commun. 2010 Jan 1;391(1):778-82. doi: 10.1016/j.bbrc.2009.11.137.

The median pre-transplant ferritin value was 1992 ng/ml (range: 6-9580 ng/ml). No patients received iron chelation therapy preceding transplantation. On univariate analysis, there was a strong correlation between a higher pre-transplant serum ferritin (>1500 ng/ml) and a significantly inferior 3-year OS (64.6+/-7.5% vs 39.6+/-7.3%, p=0.01). However, pre-transplant serum ferritin did not influence 3-year TRM (20.2+/-7% vs 27.4+/-7%, p=0.24). There was no difference in infection-related mortality, and incidence of acute or chronic GvHD between cohorts. On multivariate analysis, a raised serum ferritin (HR: 2.00, 95% CI: 0.97-3.57, p=0.03), and the presence of >5% bone marrow blasts at time of transplantation (HR: 2.14, 95% CI: 0.84-4.58, p=0.06) were independent predictors of an inferior overall survival. However, pre-transplant serum ferritin was not a significant predictor of disease-free survival, relapse or TRM. When compared with myeloablative regimens, RIC regimens may attenuate the impact of iron overload related end-organ toxicity. Prospective studies incorporating alternative biomarkers of iron metabolism alongside serum ferritin levels are needed to improve our understanding of the significance of iron overload in MDS patients undergoing allogeneic transplantation.","['Lim, Z Y', 'Fiaccadori, V', 'Gandhi, S', 'Hayden, J', 'Kenyon, M', 'Ireland, R', 'Marsh, J', 'Ho, A Y L', 'Mufti, G J', 'Pagliuca, A']","['Lim ZY', 'Fiaccadori V', 'Gandhi S', 'Hayden J', 'Kenyon M', 'Ireland R', 'Marsh J', 'Ho AY', 'Mufti GJ', 'Pagliuca A']","['Department of Haematological Medicine, Kings College Hospital, Division of Cancer Studies, Kings College London, London, UK. ziyi.lim@kcl.ac.uk']",['eng'],"['Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article']",20091126,England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,"['0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)', '9007-73-2 (Ferritins)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Female', 'Ferritins/analysis/*blood', 'Follow-Up Studies', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/methods', 'Humans', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/administration & dosage', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*blood/diagnosis/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*blood/diagnosis/pathology/*therapy', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/blood/therapy', 'Prognosis', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Time Factors', 'Transplantation Conditioning/methods', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Young Adult']",2009/12/01 06:00,2010/06/09 06:00,['2009/12/01 06:00'],"['2009/06/30 00:00 [received]', '2009/09/21 00:00 [revised]', '2009/10/31 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/12/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/12/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/06/09 06:00 [medline]']","['S0145-2126(09)00521-9 [pii]', '10.1016/j.leukres.2009.10.028 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 2010 Jun;34(6):723-7. doi: 10.1016/j.leukres.2009.10.028.

Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), and in particular imatinib, introduced fundamental changes in the treatment of CML, becoming, in most cases, the first-line treatment of choice in the chronic phase of this disease. Compared to other available therapies imatinib results in a marked increase in overall survival, tolerability and quality of life. The introduction of second generation TKI, with increased potency against bcr-abl1, expanded the number of therapeutic options for this disease and offers an alternative for patients resistant or intolerant to imatinib or who have progressed to the accelerated phase under this therapy. In order to achieve optimal outcomes, TKI therapy must be managed rigorously, requiring a careful monitoring of treatment response in pre-established time periods, thus permitting disease evaluation and safe decision of the most adequate option. Despite the definition of the criteria for imatinib treatment response, the therapeutic strategies to adopt according to the responses obtained are less clear. The objective of this paper is to review the criteria for CML diagnosis, treatment and monitoring, with recommendations as to the most adequate therapeutic choice according to the response to TKI therapy. The paper also focuses the current lines of investigation and debate areas that in the short term can significantly change the therapeutic scenario in this disease. These recommendations, supported by published scientific evidence and by the clinical practice of the expert panel involved in their elaboration, may constitute an important instrument for a better understanding and standardisation of the treatment and monitoring of CML in Portugal.","['Almeida, Antonio', 'Castro, Isabel', 'Coutinho, Jorge', 'Guerra, Lurdes', 'Marques, Herlander', 'Pereira, Ana Marques']","['Almeida A', 'Castro I', 'Coutinho J', 'Guerra L', 'Marques H', 'Pereira AM']",['Departamento de Hematologia.

RESULTS: There were 85 cases of CML Philadelphia-chromosome-positive patients. Major molecular response [corrected] (MMR) of 0.05% was achieved in 40 (47%) of 85 patients and 3-log reduction was achieved in 37 (44%) after 6 months of imatinib therapy. When molecular monitoring was extended to 12 months in a subset of delayed responsive cases (17 cases) who did not achieve an MMR at 6 months, significant changes in BCR-ABL/ABL ratio were noticed. Fifteen de novo CML patients were started directly on treatment and were monitored for BCR-ABL/ABL ratio for a further period of up to 24 months. Their median of BCR-ABL/ABL ratio was 18% at diagnosis, 0.3% after 6 months, 0.2% after 12 months, and 0.01% after 18 and 24 months. Four (27%) of 15 patients achieved MMR as 3-log reduction after 6 months, 6 (40%) after 12 months, 9 (60%) after 18 months, and 7 (46%) after 24 months. No mutation(s) or polymorphism(s) were detected in all tested patients at diagnosis, at 6 months following imatinib and following 12 months for patients showing delayed response. CONCLUSION: BCR-ABL mutations are rare in early chronic phase and increases with CML disease progression. Therefore, search for other causes in resistant cases at this phase should be sought.","['Khalil, Salem H', 'Abu-Amero, Khaled K', 'Al Mohareb, Fahad', 'Chaudhri, Naeem A']","['Khalil SH', 'Abu-Amero KK', 'Al Mohareb F', 'Chaudhri NA']","['Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, King Faisal Specialist Hospital and Research Centre, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Genet Test Mol Biomarkers,Genetic testing and molecular biomarkers,101494210,"['0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Base Sequence', 'Benzamides', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/genetics', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'DNA Primers/genetics', 'DNA, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Female', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/genetics', 'Genes, abl', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation', 'Piperazines/*therapeutic use', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*therapeutic use', 'Pyrimidines/*therapeutic use', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Saudi Arabia', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Young Adult']",2009/12/01 06:00,2010/05/26 06:00,['2009/12/01 06:00'],"['2009/12/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/12/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/05/26 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1089/gtmb.2009.0126 [doi]'],ppublish,Genet Test Mol Biomarkers. 2010 Feb;14(1):67-74. doi: 10.1089/gtmb.2009.0126.,14,,,,,,['Genet Test Mol Biomarkers. 2010 Apr;14(2):283'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, ionizing radiation causes a number of adverse long-term side effects in the brain, including cognitive impairment. Hippocampal neurogenesis is important for place learning and has been shown to be decreased by irradiation (IR) in rats and mice. In the present study, 10-day-old male mice received 6-Gy IR to the brain on postnatal day 10. We used BrdU labeling of the granule cell layer (GCL) of the hippocampus to evaluate cell proliferation and survival. An unbiased, automated platform for monitoring of behavior in a group housing environment (IntelliCage) was used to evaluate place learning 2 months after IR. We show that cranial IR impaired place learning and reduced BrdU labeling by 50% in the GCL. Cranial IR also reduced whole body weight gain 5%. We conclude that this experimental paradigm provides a novel and time-saving model to detect differences in place learning in mice subjected to IR. This method of detecting behavioral differences can be used for further studies of adverse effects of IR on hippocampal neurogenesis and possible new strategies to ameliorate the negative effects of IR on cognition.","['Barlind, Anna', 'Karlsson, Niklas', 'Bjork-Eriksson, Thomas', 'Isgaard, Jorgen', 'Blomgren, Klas']","['Barlind A', 'Karlsson N', 'Bjork-Eriksson T', 'Isgaard J', 'Blomgren K']","['Laboratory of Experimental Endocrinology, Department of Internal Medicine, Sahlgrenska Academy at the University of Gothenburg, Gothenburg, Sweden. anna.barlind@medic.gu.se']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20091127,Germany,Exp Brain Res,Experimental brain research,0043312,['G34N38R2N1 (Bromodeoxyuridine)'],IM,"['Aging', 'Animals', 'Body Weight/radiation effects', 'Bromodeoxyuridine', 'Cell Proliferation/radiation effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Hippocampus/physiopathology/*radiation effects', 'Learning/*radiation effects', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Neurogenesis/*radiation effects', 'Neurons/physiology/*radiation effects', 'Neuropsychological Tests', 'Random Allocation', 'Space Perception/*radiation effects', 'Time Factors']",2009/11/28 06:00,2010/06/18 06:00,['2009/11/28 06:00'],"['2009/07/10 00:00 [received]', '2009/11/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/11/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/11/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/06/18 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00221-009-2095-8 [doi]'],ppublish,Exp Brain Res. 2010 Apr;201(4):781-7. doi: 10.1007/s00221-009-2095-8.

Some particularities of this case are the young age and the extremely rapid development of the malignant disease in a patient with no previous signs of acute non-lymphoblastic leukemia. The initial diagnosis was of malabsorbtion syndrome, based on the clinical exam at presentation, and then the patient was thought to have a form of Hirschprung's disease, due to a functional intestinal disorder (slow transit).

On the light microscope images, we observed important differences between the sizes of MKs and of MKs nuclei in CGL, PV, and ET. On the TEM images, we also noted important differences concerning the size and the aspect of nuclei, aspect of mitochondria, the amount and distribution of RER, Golgi apparatus and demarcation membrane system; the most important are the differences recorded in the number, distribution and sizes of vacuoles, alpha-granules and of the dense bodies. This study provides evidence that there are significant morphological differences between the cellular structures in the MKs from the patients with diagnosed with different CMDs, and thus sustains the utilization of this approach for establishing the differential diagnosis of CMDs.","['Schelker, R', 'Florea, A', 'Urian, Laura', 'Patiu, Mariana', 'Petrov, L']","['Schelker R', 'Florea A', 'Urian L', 'Patiu M', 'Petrov L']","['Department of Cell and Molecular Biology, Faculty of Medicine, ""Iuliu Hatieganu"" University of Medicine and Pharmacy, Cluj-Napoca, Romania.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Romania,Rom J Morphol Embryol,Romanian journal of morphology and embryology = Revue roumaine de morphologie et embryologie,9112454,,IM,"['Cell Nucleus Size', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Chronic-Phase/*diagnosis/pathology', 'Megakaryocytes/*ultrastructure', 'Polycythemia Vera/*diagnosis/pathology', 'Thrombocythemia, Essential/*diagnosis/pathology']",2009/11/28 06:00,2010/04/23 06:00,['2009/11/28 06:00'],"['2009/11/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/11/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/04/23 06:00 [medline]']",['500409595603 [pii]'],ppublish,Rom J Morphol Embryol. 2009;50(4):595-603.,50,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we describe the sensitization by microtubule-interfering agents (MIAs) to TRAIL-induced apoptosis in breast tumor cells through a mitotic arrest and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK)-dependent mechanism. MIA treatment resulted in BubR1-dependent mitotic arrest leading to the sustained activation of JNK and the proteasome-mediated downregulation of cellular FLICE-inhibitory protein (cFLIP) and myeloid cell leukemia-1 (Mcl-1) expression. The JNK inhibitor SP600125 abrogated MIA-induced mitotic arrest and downregulation of cFLIP and Mcl-1 and reduced the apoptosis caused by the combination of MIAs and TRAIL. Silencing of cFLIP and Mcl-1 expression by RNA interference resulted in a marked sensitization to TRAIL-induced apoptosis. Furthermore, in FLIP-overexpressing cells, MIA-induced sensitization to TRAIL-activated apoptosis was markedly reduced. In summary, our results show that mitotic arrest imposed by MIAs activates JNK and facilitates TRAIL-induced activation of an apoptotic pathway in breast tumor cells by promoting the proteasome-mediated degradation of cFLIP and Mcl-1.","['Sanchez-Perez, T', 'Ortiz-Ferron, G', 'Lopez-Rivas, A']","['Sanchez-Perez T', 'Ortiz-Ferron G', 'Lopez-Rivas A']","['Centro Andaluz de Biologia Molecular y Medicina Regenerativa, Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas, Sevilla, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20091127,England,Cell Death Differ,Cell death and differentiation,9437445,"['0 (CASP8 and FADD-Like Apoptosis Regulating Protein)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand)', '0 (Tubulin Modulators)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 3.4.25.1 (Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex)', 'SH1WY3R615 (Nocodazole)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Breast Neoplasms/drug therapy/metabolism', 'CASP8 and FADD-Like Apoptosis Regulating Protein/*metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Immunoblotting', 'JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases', 'Mitosis/*drug effects', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Nocodazole/pharmacology', 'Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*metabolism', 'RNA Interference', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand/*therapeutic use', 'Tubulin Modulators/*therapeutic use']",2009/11/28 06:00,2010/06/29 06:00,['2009/11/28 06:00'],"['2009/11/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/11/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/06/29 06:00 [medline]']","['cdd2009176 [pii]', '10.1038/cdd.2009.176 [doi]']",ppublish,Cell Death Differ. 2010 May;17(5):883-94. doi: 10.1038/cdd.2009.176.

RAS(V12)-induced senescence in murine cells depends on the induction of the ARF/p53 and the retinoblastoma (Rb) family tumor suppressor pathways. We and others have shown previously that oncogene-induced senescence in vitro can be used as a tool to identify new cancer-related genes. In addition, we have shown that oncogene-induced senescence corresponds to an in vivo tumor suppressive mechanism. Therefore, we extended our search for novel genes that bypass of RAS(V12)-induced senescence, with the help of a previously designed unbiased functional screen with cDNA expression libraries. In this screen, we expected to find new mediators feeding into the p53 or Rb pathways or novel signaling factors. We report here the identification of leukemia/lymphoma related factor (Lrf) encoding a transcription factor with a BTB/POZ domain and Kruppel-like zinc fingers. This gene was previously identified as a potential oncogene that is overexpressed in human cancer. We find that LRF enhances E2F-dependent transcription and that it synergizes with RAS(V12) in activating E2F. Indeed, LRF-mediated bypass of RAS(V12)-induced senescence is accompanied by the induction of several E2F-target genes, including Cyclin E, Cyclin A and p107. Unexpectedly, LRF exerted this activity independent of several critical senescence inducers, such as p19(ARF), p21(CIP) and p16(INK4A). We show that CYCLIN E is necessary for LRF-mediated bypass, suggesting that it corresponds to a critical mediator of LRF-driven oncogenic transformation. Thus, LRF bypasses RAS(V12)-induced senescence in a CYCLIN E-dependent manner, which conceivably contributes to its role in cancer.","['Vredeveld, Liesbeth C W', 'Rowland, Benjamin D', 'Douma, Sirith', 'Bernards, Rene', 'Peeper, Daniel S']","['Vredeveld LC', 'Rowland BD', 'Douma S', 'Bernards R', 'Peeper DS']","['Division of Molecular Genetics, Center for Biomedical Genetics and Cancer Genomics Center, The Netherlands Cancer Institute, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20091125,England,Carcinogenesis,Carcinogenesis,8008055,"['0 (Cyclin E)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (ZBTB7A protein, human)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins p21(ras))']",IM,"['Animals', 'Blotting, Western', '*Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', '*Cellular Senescence', 'Cyclin E/genetics/*metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Gene Library', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'NIH 3T3 Cells', 'Oncogenes/*physiology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins p21(ras)/*physiology', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Up-Regulation']",2009/11/28 06:00,2010/03/05 06:00,['2009/11/28 06:00'],"['2009/11/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/11/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/03/05 06:00 [medline]']","['bgp296 [pii]', '10.1093/carcin/bgp296 [doi]']",ppublish,Carcinogenesis. 2010 Feb;31(2):201-7. doi: 10.1093/carcin/bgp296.

Cases aged 0-14 years were ascertained from the German Childhood Cancer Registry. Controls were selected from local resident registration offices. The parental occupational history was recorded in questionnaires and telephone interviews, and preconceptional magnetic field exposure was estimated according to a job-exposure matrix. The analysis included 2,382 controls and 2,049 cases (846 children with acute leukemia, 159 children with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, 444 children with central nervous system tumors, and 600 children with other solid tumors). Frequency-matched conditional logistic regression models revealed no increased cancer risks in children whose fathers were occupationally exposed to magnetic fields above 0.2 microT. Additionally, there was no evidence for a risk increase at magnetic field levels exceeding 1 microT. Based on much smaller numbers, maternal occupational exposure was also not related to increased cancer risks. In this large case-control study, the risk of childhood cancer was not linked to preconceptional parental ELF-MF exposure.","['Hug, Kerstin', 'Grize, Leticia', 'Seidler, Andreas', 'Kaatsch, Peter', 'Schuz, Joachim']","['Hug K', 'Grize L', 'Seidler A', 'Kaatsch P', 'Schuz J']","['Institute of Social and Preventive Medicine at Swiss Tropical Institute Basel, Steinengraben 49, CH-4051 Basel, Switzerland. kerstin.hug@unibas.ch']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20091125,United States,Am J Epidemiol,American journal of epidemiology,7910653,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Age Factors', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Confidence Intervals', 'Electromagnetic Fields/*adverse effects', 'Female', 'Germany/epidemiology', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Interviews as Topic', 'Logistic Models', 'Male', 'Maternal Exposure/*adverse effects', 'Neoplasms/*epidemiology/etiology', 'Occupational Exposure/*adverse effects', 'Odds Ratio', 'Parents', 'Paternal Exposure/*adverse effects', 'Registries', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Surveys and Questionnaires']",2009/11/28 06:00,2010/01/30 06:00,['2009/11/28 06:00'],"['2009/11/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/11/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/01/30 06:00 [medline]']","['kwp339 [pii]', '10.1093/aje/kwp339 [doi]']",ppublish,Am J Epidemiol. 2010 Jan 1;171(1):27-35. doi: 10.1093/aje/kwp339.

Coupled with genetic complementation analysis and transcriptional profiling, these studies revealed a rich collection of targets containing a characteristic binding motif of greater complexity than WGATAR. GATA factors occupied loci encoding multiple components of the Scl/TAL1 complex, a master regulator of hematopoiesis and leukemogenic target. Mechanistic analyses provided evidence for crossregulatory and autoregulatory interactions among components of this complex, including GATA-2 induction of the hematopoietic corepressor ETO-2 and an ETO-2-negative autoregulatory loop.

There are many systemic conditions with unvarying manifestations at the level of the gums and deep periodontium; leukemias have varying rates of development, and in most cases a reserved prognosis. In leukemias, periodontal lesions are caused by various microbial factors, coupled with immunological modifications characteristic of the systemic condition and sometimes exacerbated by loco-regional leukocyte infiltration. If the periodontium is free of tumoral infiltrates, then periodontal lesions are easier to treat and the results are more stable. Loco-regional tumoral infiltration requires more sustained local treatment, able to diminish the spread and delay relapse of periodontal lesions. Diagnosing tumoral infiltrates at the level of the oral cavity is therefore of great importance. Computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging investigations are costly, especially when conducted repeatedly, and histopathological investigations are invasive and predispose to complications. A diagnostic alternative is thermographic imaging; this is useful in inflammations, infections and tumoral infiltrates, and can therefore be used in several distinct pathological medical conditions. Inflammatory and infectious lesions of the oral cavity can be treated locally, and their healing clinically objectified. In the absence of inflammation and infection, any modifications that arise could therefore be attributed with a high probability to loco-regional tumoral infiltrates. The study was conducted on 10 patients at the Fundeni Clinical Hospital, and documented pathological changes at the level of the periodontium, based on clinical, thermographic and histopathological observations. The results suggest that thermographic imaging could be used to reveal possible oral leukemic infiltrates when performed after therapeutic remission of specific infectious and inflammatory periodontal lesions.","['Paunica, Stana C', 'Dumitriu, Anca', 'Mogos, Mihai', 'Georgescu, Otilia', 'Mogos, Ioan']","['Paunica SC', 'Dumitriu A', 'Mogos M', 'Georgescu O', 'Mogos I']","[""'Dan Theodorescu' Hospital, Department of Paradontology, 'Carol Davila' University of Medicine and Pharmacy, Romania. spaunica@yahoo.com""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,England,Hematology,"Hematology (Amsterdam, Netherlands)",9708388,,IM,"['Adult', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*diagnosis/pathology', 'Male', 'Mouth Neoplasms/*diagnosis/pathology/secondary', '*Periodontium', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*diagnosis/pathology', '*Thermography']",2009/11/28 06:00,2010/02/03 06:00,['2009/11/28 06:00'],"['2009/11/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/11/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/02/03 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1179/102453309X12473408860505 [doi]'],ppublish,Hematology. 2009 Dec;14(6):341-6. doi: 10.1179/102453309X12473408860505.,14,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: MDM-2 expression by flow cytometry and p53 gene status by PCR were determined in peripheral blood or bone marrow of 46 ALL children (at initial diagnosis) and control group. RESULTS: MDM-2 was significantly overexpressed in 15 patients (32.6%). p53 mutation was detected in six out of 46 patients at initial diagnosis, three of them were out of 29 cases achieving complete remission (CR) and the other three cases were out of 17 of relapsed patients, which is significantly higher than CR group (P<0.05). Positive correlation was found between the MDM-2 overexpression and initial WBCs count, peripheral blast cell count and presence of CNS blasts (P<0.05, <0.05 and <0.05 respectively). CONCLUSION: MDM-2 is overexpressed in a significant number of childhood ALL, and more often observed in the poor outcome group and its frequency is not related to p53 status. Measurement of MDM-2 as a bad prognostic marker even in cases with non-mutant p53 is very important. Moreover, MDM-2 may be a potential molecular target for production of new cancer therapy.","['Hendy, Olfat M', 'Elghannam, Doaa M', 'El-Sharnouby, Jehan A', 'Goda, Enas F', 'El-Ashry, Rasha', 'Al-Tonbary, Youssef']","['Hendy OM', 'Elghannam DM', 'El-Sharnouby JA', 'Goda EF', 'El-Ashry R', 'Al-Tonbary Y']","['Clinical Pathology Department, (National Liver Institute), Menoufiya University, Egypt.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,England,Hematology,"Hematology (Amsterdam, Netherlands)",9708388,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (TP53 protein, human)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (MDM2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-mdm2)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Blast Crisis/diagnosis/*genetics/*metabolism/pathology/therapy', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/diagnosis/*genetics/*metabolism/pathology/therapy', 'Prognosis', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-mdm2/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Recurrence', 'Remission Induction', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/*genetics/metabolism']",2009/11/28 06:00,2010/02/03 06:00,['2009/11/28 06:00'],"['2009/11/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/11/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/02/03 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1179/102453309X12473408860389 [doi]'],ppublish,Hematology. 2009 Dec;14(6):335-40. doi: 10.1179/102453309X12473408860389.,14,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Thus, three anthraquinones (Namely: aloesin, aloe-emodin and barbaloin) were extracted from A. vera leaves by supercritical fluid extraction and subsequently purified by high performance liquid chromatography. Additionally, the N-terminal octapeptide derived from verectin, a biologically active 14 kDa glycoprotein present in A. vera, was also tested. In vivo, active principles exhibited significant prolongation of the life span of tumor-transplanted animals in the following order: barbaloin> octapeptide> aloesin > aloe-emodin. A. vera active principles exhibited significant inhibition on Ehrlich ascite carcinoma cell (EACC) number, when compared to positive control group, in the following order: barbaloin> aloe-emodin > octapeptide > aloesin. Moreover, in trypan blue cell viability assay, active principles showed a significant concentration-dependent cytotoxicity against acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and acute lymphocytes leukemia (ALL) cancerous cells. Furthermore, in MTT cell viability test, aloe-emodin was found to be active against two human colon cancer cell lines (i.e. DLD-1 and HT2), with IC(50) values of 8.94 and 10.78 microM, respectively. Treatments of human AML leukemic cells with active principles (100 microg ml(-1)) resulted in varying intensities of internucleosomal DNA fragmentation, hallmark of cells undergoing apoptosis, in the following order: aloe-emodin> aloesin> barbaloin> octapeptide. Intererstingly, treatment of EACC tumors with active principles resulted in a significant elevation activity of key antioxidant enzymes (SOD, GST, tGPx, and LDH). Our data suggest that the tested A. vera compounds may exert their chemo-preventive effect through modulating antioxidant and detoxification enzyme activity levels, as they are one of the indicators of tumorigenesis. These findings are discussed in the light of the potential of A. vera plant extracts for developing efficient, specific and non-toxic anticancer drugs that are affordable for developing countries.","['El-Shemy, H A', 'Aboul-Soud, M A M', 'Nassr-Allah, A A', 'Aboul-Enein, K M', 'Kabash, A', 'Yagi, A']","['El-Shemy HA', 'Aboul-Soud MA', 'Nassr-Allah AA', 'Aboul-Enein KM', 'Kabash A', 'Yagi A']","['Director of Biotechnology Labs FARP, Biochemistry and Molecular Biology Biochemistry Department, Faculty of Agriculture Cairo University 12613 Giza, Egypt. helshemy@hotmail.com']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",,United Arab Emirates,Curr Med Chem,Current medicinal chemistry,9440157,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Antioxidants)', '0 (Enzymes)', '0 (Plant Extracts)', '142M471B3J (Carbon Dioxide)']",IM,"['Aloe/chemistry', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/chemistry/isolation & purification/*pharmacology', 'Antioxidants/*metabolism', 'Carbon Dioxide/*chemistry', 'Chromatography, Supercritical Fluid', 'Enzymes/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Neoplasms/*drug therapy/*enzymology/metabolism/pathology', 'Plant Extracts/chemistry/isolation & purification/*pharmacology', 'Plant Leaves/chemistry']",2009/11/28 06:00,2010/08/25 06:00,['2009/11/28 06:00'],"['2009/09/18 00:00 [received]', '2009/12/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/11/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/11/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/08/25 06:00 [medline]']","['CMC - AbsEpub/2010 - 009 [pii]', '10.2174/092986710790112620 [doi]']",ppublish,Curr Med Chem. 2010;17(2):129-38. doi: 10.2174/092986710790112620.,17,,,,,49,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In most studies cancers were surgically excised shortly after RFA. We present six patients inoperable when diagnosed with BCA, and performed RFA instead of surgery. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Ultrasound-guided bipolar RFA was performed under local anesthesia in six women aged 63 - 85 years. They had core-biopsy proven T 1 - 2N0 M0, grade I or II, 1.0 - 2.7 cm sized invasive ductal cancers, with positive estrogen receptor status. Four tumors measured > 2 cm, and three 1.0 - 1.2 cm in diameter. Patients were at high-risk for general anesthesia and surgery because of severely impaired cardiac function, advanced age, or associated diseases (acute myeloid leukaemia (AML), diabetes, hypertension, depression) and/or refused surgery. RESULTS: Six tumors in five patients were completely ablated, without recurrence during follow-up (range: 9 - 49 months). One superficially located cancer was partially ablated; the patient died two months later from myocardial infarction. The Patient with AML and BCA had an infection of the treated breast after 4 months and postponed mastectomy to an AML remission status. There were no signs of malignancy in histopathology; the patient finally died of leukemia 42 months after RFA. The remaining four patients are well, without complications. CONCLUSION: Ultrasound-guided percutaneous RFA under local anesthesia is an effective alternative to surgery for BCA < 3 cm in patients with a high-risk for surgery.","['Brkljacic, B', 'Cikara, I', 'Ivanac, G', 'Hrkac Pustahija, A', 'Zic, R', 'Stanec, Z']","['Brkljacic B', 'Cikara I', 'Ivanac G', 'Hrkac Pustahija A', 'Zic R', 'Stanec Z']","['Radiology, University Hospital Dubrava. boris.brkljacic@zg.t-com.hr']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20091125,Germany,Ultraschall Med,"Ultraschall in der Medizin (Stuttgart, Germany : 1980)",8303585,,IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Biopsy, Needle', 'Breast Neoplasms/*diagnostic imaging/mortality/pathology/*surgery', 'Carcinoma, Ductal/*diagnostic imaging/mortality/pathology', 'Catheter Ablation/*methods', 'Cause of Death', 'Comorbidity', 'Disease Progression', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Pilot Projects', 'Ultrasonography, Interventional/*methods', '*Ultrasonography, Mammary']",2009/11/27 06:00,2010/07/01 06:00,['2009/11/27 06:00'],"['2009/11/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/11/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/07/01 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1055/s-0028-1109898 [doi]'],ppublish,Ultraschall Med. 2010 Apr;31(2):156-62. doi: 10.1055/s-0028-1109898.

As a result of these patients' underlying compromised defenses and susceptibility to atypical organisms, tissue biopsies from patients within this population may demonstrate nonclassical histopathological findings. Here, we describe an unusual granulomatous reaction to gram-positive cocci in the skin of a 52-year-old man undergoing salvage chemotherapy for acute myeloid leukemia. The patient presented with a papular eruption on the arms, trunk, and face and fever; concomitant blood cultures were positive for Rothia mucilaginosa and Streptococcus salivarius. Histologic evaluation revealed a granulomatous dermatitis associated with numerous small, round, predominantly intracellular bacteria. Classically, cutaneous infiltrates associated with coccoid bacterial infections are suppurative and not granulomatous. The intracellular organisms stained positive for Gram, periodic acid-Schiff, and Grocott methenamine silver stains, suggestive of R. mucilaginosa. Rothia mucilaginosa, a component of the oral flora, was first reported as a human pathogen in 1978. Although the majority of cases in the literature have described R. mucilaginosa bacteremia, other reported manifestations include meningitis, endocarditis, pneumonia, osteomyelitis, and peritonitis. To our knowledge, however, only 1 prior report has described a cutaneous manifestation of R. mucilaginosa septicemia, which occurred in a patient with neutropenia. This is the second reported case of an infectious granulomatous dermatitis associated with R. mucilaginosa bacteremia and raises awareness of this unusual histopathological presentation in the setting of a bacterial infection affecting the skin.","['Morgan, Elizabeth A', 'Henrich, Timothy J', 'Jarell, Abel D', 'Shieh, Wun-Ju', 'Zaki, Sherif R', 'Marty, Francisco M', 'Thorner, Anna R', 'Milner, Dan A', 'Velazquez, Elsa F']","['Morgan EA', 'Henrich TJ', 'Jarell AD', 'Shieh WJ', 'Zaki SR', 'Marty FM', 'Thorner AR', 'Milner DA', 'Velazquez EF']","[""Department of Pathology, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, MA, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",,United States,Am J Dermatopathol,The American Journal of dermatopathology,7911005,,IM,"['Actinomycetales Infections/complications/microbiology', 'Bacteremia/*complications/microbiology', 'Biopsy', 'Dermatitis/*diagnosis/*microbiology', 'Drug Therapy', 'Humans', 'Immunocompromised Host', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy', 'Male', 'Micrococcaceae/*pathogenicity', 'Middle Aged', 'Opportunistic Infections/complications/microbiology', 'Skin/microbiology/pathology']",2009/11/27 06:00,2010/07/07 06:00,['2009/11/27 06:00'],"['2009/11/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/11/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/07/07 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1097/DAD.0b013e3181b1c5ad [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Dermatopathol. 2010 Apr;32(2):175-9. doi: 10.1097/DAD.0b013e3181b1c5ad.,32,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The mutation was detected by allele-specific PCR (AS-PCR). RESULTS: The V617F JAK2 mutation incidence in polycythemia vera, essential thrombocythemia and idiopathic myelofibrosis are respectively 89.47%, 62.5% and 33.33%. The V617F JAK2 mutation was absent within the patients with secondary erythrocytosis or thrombocytosis. We also found that the patients carrying the mutation displayed a leucocytosis and higher levels of haemoglobin and hematocrit than mutation-negative patients.

A great deal of work has been carried out on therapeutic potential of Ganoderma lucidum. The basidiocarp, mycelia and spores of Ganoderma lucidum contain approximately 400 different bioactive compounds, which mainly include triterpenoids, polysaccharides, nucleotides, sterols, steroids, fatty acids, proteins/peptides and trace elements which has been reported to have a number of pharmacological effects including immunomodulation, anti-atherosclerotic, anti-inflammatory, analgesic, chemo-preventive, antitumor, chemo and radio protective, sleep promoting, antibacterial, antiviral (including anti-HIV), hypolipidemic, anti-fibrotic, hepatoprotective, anti-diabetic, anti-androgenic, anti-angiogenic, anti-herpetic, antioxidative and radical-scavenging, anti-aging, hypoglycemic, estrogenic activity and anti-ulcer properties. Ganoderma lucidum has now become recognized as an alternative adjuvant in the treatment of leukemia, carcinoma, hepatitis and diabetes. The macrofungus is very rare in nature rather not sufficient for commercial exploitation for vital therapeutic emergencies, therefore, the cultivation on solid substrates, stationary liquid medium or by submerged cultivation has become an essential aspect to meet the driving force towards the increasing demands in the international market. Present review focuses on the pharmacological aspects, cultivation methods and bioactive metabolites playing a significant role in various therapeutic applications.","['Sanodiya, Bhagwan S', 'Thakur, Gulab Singh', 'Baghel, Rakesh K', 'Prasad, G B K S', 'Bisen, P S']","['Sanodiya BS', 'Thakur GS', 'Baghel RK', 'Prasad GB', 'Bisen PS']","['Research and Development Centre, Bisen Biotech and Biopharma Pvt.

The objectives of this study were to determine the effect of lunasin on the viability of L1210 leukemia cells and to understand the underlying mechanisms involved. Pure lunasin and lunasin enriched soy flour (LES) caused cytotoxicity to L1210 leukemia cells with IC(50) of 14 and 16 microM (lunasin equivalent), respectively. Simulated gastrointestinal digestion showed that 25% of the original amount of lunasin survived 3 h of pepsin digestion and 3% of lunasin remained after sequential pepsin-pancreatin digestion for a total of 6 h. Cell cycle analysis showed that lunasin caused a dose-dependent G2 cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. Treatment of L1210 leukemia cells with 1 mg/mL of LES for 18 h led to an increase in the amount of apoptotic cells from 2 to 40%. Compared to untreated cells, treatment with 1 mg/mL LES showed a 6-fold increase on the expressions of caspases-8 and -9, and and a 12-fold increase on the expression of caspase-3.

While exogenous leukemia inhibitory factor and BMP4 perpetuate a pluripotent state, less is known about the factors initiating differentiation. We show that heparan sulfate (HS) proteoglycans are critical coreceptors for signals inducing ES cell differentiation. Genetic targeting of NDST1 and NDST2, two enzymes required for N-sulfation of proteoglycans, blocked differentiation. This phenotype was rescued by HS presented in trans or by soluble heparin. NaClO(3) (-), which reduces sulfation of proteoglycans, potently blocked differentiation of wild-type cells. Mechanistically, N-sulfation was identified to be critical for functional autocrine fibroblast growth factor 4 (FGF4) signaling. Microarray analysis identified the pluripotency maintaining transcription factors Nanog, KLF2/4/8, Tbx3, and Tcf3 to be negatively regulated, whereas markers of differentiation such as Gbx2, Dnmt3b, FGF5, and Brachyury were induced by sulfation-dependent FGF receptor (FGFR) signaling. We show that several of these genes are heterogeneously expressed in ES cells, and that targeting of heparan sulfation or FGFR-signaling facilitated a homogenous Nanog/KLF4/Tbx3 positive ES cell state. This finding suggests that the recently discovered heterogeneous state of ES cells is regulated by HS-dependent FGFR signaling. Similarly, culturing blastocysts with NaClO(3) (-) eliminated GATA6-positive primitive endoderm progenitors generating a homogenous Nanog-positive inner cell mass. Functionally, reduction of sulfation robustly improved de novo ES cell derivation efficiency. We conclude that N-sulfated HS is required for FGF4 signaling to maintain ES cells primed for differentiation in a heterogeneous state. Inhibiting this pathway facilitates a more naive ground state.","['Lanner, Fredrik', 'Lee, Kian Leong', 'Sohl, Marcus', 'Holmborn, Katarina', 'Yang, Henry', 'Wilbertz, Johannes', 'Poellinger, Lorenz', 'Rossant, Janet', 'Farnebo, Filip']","['Lanner F', 'Lee KL', 'Sohl M', 'Holmborn K', 'Yang H', 'Wilbertz J', 'Poellinger L', 'Rossant J', 'Farnebo F']","['Department of Cell and Molecular Biology, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden.

Degradation of procaspases, production of tBid, loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, Bcl-2 degradation, mitochondrial translocation of Bax, and cytochrome c release were observed in PLA(2)-treated cells. Moreover, PLA(2) treatment increased Fas and FasL protein expression. Upon exposure to PLA(2), activation of p38 MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinase) and JNK (c-Jun NH(2)-terminal kinase) was found in K562 cells. SB202190 (p38 MAPK inhibitor) pretreatment enhanced cytotoxic effect of PLA(2) and led to prolonged JNK activation, but failed to affect PLA(2)-induced upregulation of Fas and FasL protein expression. Sustained JNK activation aggravated caspase8/mitochondria-dependent death pathway, downregulated Bcl-2 expression and increased mitochondrial translocation of Bax. SP600125 (JNK inhibitor) abolished the cytotoxic effect of PLA(2) and PLA(2)-induced autocrine Fas death pathway. Transfection ASK1 siRNA and overexpression of dominant negative p38alpha MAPK proved that ASK1 pathway was responsible for PLA(2)-induced p38 MAPK and JNK activation and p38alpha MAPK activation suppressed dynamically persistent JNK activation.

Samples were typically from chickens with myelocytomas or proventricular lesions. ALV-J was isolated from 25 flocks including seven out of seven flocks containing ""yellow chickens"" or other local breeds and several flocks of layer chickens. REV was isolated from 19 flocks. Co-infection of ALV-J and REV was confirmed in 11/38 birds of 8/15 flocks with myelocytomatosis and in 11/24 birds of 3/5 flocks with proventricular lesions. Both ALV-J and REV were vertically transmitted in four breeder flocks of local chicken breeds. One experiment in specific pathogen free chickens indicated that co-infection at hatch strongly depressed antibody responses to ALV-J but not to REV. The results suggest that infections with both ALV-J and REV have become endemic in local breeds, including breeder flocks where both viruses appear to be perpetuated by vertical transmission. In addition, both viruses were present in at least some commercial broiler, layer and breeder flocks. Eradication programmes are needed but will be difficult, especially in local breeds. This unprecedented concurrence of simultaneous endemic infections with ALV-J and REV may have serious economic consequences and needs to be better understood.","['Cui, Zhizhong', 'Sun, Shuhong', 'Zhang, Zhi', 'Meng, Shanshan']","['Cui Z', 'Sun S', 'Zhang Z', 'Meng S']","['College of Veterinary Medicine, Shandong Agricultural University, Taian, China. zzcui@sdau.edu.cn']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Avian Pathol,Avian pathology : journal of the W.V.P.A,8210638,"['0 (Antibodies, Viral)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Viral/blood', 'Avian Leukosis/complications/*virology', 'Avian Leukosis Virus/*classification/*isolation & purification', 'Chick Embryo', 'Chickens/*genetics', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Infectious Disease Transmission, Vertical/veterinary', 'Poultry Diseases/epidemiology/genetics/*virology', 'Reticuloendotheliosis Viruses, Avian/*isolation & purification', 'Retroviridae Infections/complications/*veterinary/virology', 'Specific Pathogen-Free Organisms', 'Tumor Virus Infections/complications/*veterinary/virology', 'Viremia']",2009/11/26 06:00,2010/02/06 06:00,['2009/11/26 06:00'],"['2009/11/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/11/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/02/06 06:00 [medline]']","['917119910 [pii]', '10.1080/03079450903349188 [doi]']",ppublish,Avian Pathol. 2009 Dec;38(6):443-8. doi: 10.1080/03079450903349188.,38,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the value of the WBC count at which there is a high risk of early death (ED) and the efficiency of supportive treatments remain unclear. In this report, a series of 187 consecutive adult patients with AML in our institution was reviewed. The outcome of 40 patients with WBC above 50x10(9) L(-1) (hyperleukocytosis) was compared to 147 patients with a leukocyte count lower than 50x10(9) L(-1). The group with hyperleukocytosis showed a significantly shorter OS (P<0.0001) and a higher rate of ED (P=0.0008). Even when the data from ED patients were removed from analysis, we still detected a shorter OS in patients with hyperleukocytosis (P=0.0049), which suggests that high WBC number influences long-term survival, and not only ED. We also observed higher lactic dehydrogenase (LDH) and serum creatinine levels in the group of patients with hyperleukocytosis (P=0.0003 and 0.0406, respectively). Besides considering all the patients with ED, we could observe higher levels of lactic dehydrogenase, a serum creatinine and nitrogen urea (P=0.0056, P=0.0008 and P<0.0001, respectively). Pulmonary involvement was more frequent in patients with ED (P=0.0277). In conclusion, hyperleukocytosis confers a poorer prognosis in patients with AML.","['Oliveira, L C O', 'Romano, L G M', 'Prado-Junior, B P A', 'Covas, D T', 'Rego, E M', 'De Santis, G C']","['Oliveira LC', 'Romano LG', 'Prado-Junior BP', 'Covas DT', 'Rego EM', 'De Santis GC']","['Medical School of Ribeirao Preto, University of Sao Paulo, Rua Tenente Catao Roxo, 2501, Ribeirao Preto, SP, 14051-140, Brazil. lucooliveira@yahoo.com.br']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20091125,United States,Med Oncol,"Medical oncology (Northwood, London, England)",9435512,"['AYI8EX34EU (Creatinine)', 'EC 1.1.1.27 (L-Lactate Dehydrogenase)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Brazil', 'Creatinine/blood', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'L-Lactate Dehydrogenase/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/complications/*mortality/therapy', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Leukocytosis/*etiology/*mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Rate', 'Young Adult']",2009/11/26 06:00,2011/04/09 06:00,['2009/11/26 06:00'],"['2009/09/21 00:00 [received]', '2009/11/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/11/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/11/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/04/09 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s12032-009-9367-9 [doi]'],ppublish,Med Oncol. 2010 Dec;27(4):1254-9. doi: 10.1007/s12032-009-9367-9.

Imaging methods using a red-shifted thermostable luciferase from Photinus pyralis were optimized to improve the sensitivity and image resolution. In vivo bioluminescence imaging performance of red- and green-emitting luciferases were compared in two different xenograft mouse models for cancer. METHODS: Human hepatoblastoma cell line (HepG2) and human acute monocytic leukemia cell line (Thp1) cells were genetically engineered using retroviral vector technology to stably express the red-shifted or the wild-type green luciferase. A xenograft model of liver cancer was established by subcutaneous injection of the HepG2-engineered cells in the flank regions of mice, and a leukemia model was generated by intravenous injection of the engineered Thp1 cells. The cancer progression was monitored with an ultrasensitive charge-coupled device camera. The relative intensities of the green- and red-emitting luciferases were measured, and the resulting spatial resolutions of the images were compared. Imaging was performed with both intact and scarified live animals to quantify the absorption effects of the skin and deep tissue. RESULTS: The red-emitting luciferase was found to emit a bioluminescence signal with improved transmission properties compared to the green-emitting luciferase. By imaging the HepG2 models, which contained tumors just beneath the skin, before and after scarification, the percentage of light absorbed by the skin was calculated. The green bioluminescent signal was 75 +/- 8% absorbed by the skin, whereas the red signal was only 20 +/- 6% absorbed. The Thp1 model, which contains cancer cells within the bones, was likewise imaged before and after scarification to calculate the percentage of light absorbed by all tissue under the skin. This tissue was responsible for 90 +/- 5% absorption of the green signal, but only 65 +/- 6% absorption of the red signal. CONCLUSION: Two different bioluminescent mouse cancer models demonstrate the utility of a new red-shifted thermostable luciferase, Ppy RE-TS, that improved the in vivo imaging performance when compared with wild-type P. Pyralis luciferase. While wild-type luciferase is currently a popular reporter for in vivo imaging methods, this study demonstrates the potential of red-emitting firefly luciferase mutants to enhance the performance of bioluminescence imaging experiments.","['Mezzanotte, Laura', 'Fazzina, Raffaella', 'Michelini, Elisa', 'Tonelli, Roberto', 'Pession, Andrea', 'Branchini, Bruce', 'Roda, Aldo']","['Mezzanotte L', 'Fazzina R', 'Michelini E', 'Tonelli R', 'Pession A', 'Branchini B', 'Roda A']","['Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Bologna, Via Belmeloro 6, 40126 Bologna, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",20091125,United States,Mol Imaging Biol,Molecular imaging and biology,101125610,"['0 (Benzothiazoles)', '0 (D-luciferin)', 'EC 1.13.12.- (Luciferases)']",IM,"['Absorption/drug effects', 'Animals', 'Benzothiazoles/administration & dosage/pharmacology', 'Cell Count', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Color', 'Disease Progression', 'Enzyme Stability/drug effects', 'Hep G2 Cells', 'Humans', 'Injections, Intraperitoneal', 'Kinetics', '*Luciferases', 'Luminescent Measurements/*methods', 'Mice', 'Molecular Imaging/*methods', 'Photons', 'Substrate Specificity/drug effects', '*Temperature', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Burden/drug effects', '*Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",2009/11/26 06:00,2010/11/11 06:00,['2009/11/26 06:00'],"['2009/08/13 00:00 [received]', '2009/10/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/11/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/11/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/11/11 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s11307-009-0291-3 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Imaging Biol. 2010 Aug;12(4):406-14. doi: 10.1007/s11307-009-0291-3.

It is concluded that the overexpression of GCS gene is one of the reasons which lead to multidrug resistance (MDR) of leukemia cell. Meanwhile, we also found that higher expression of Bcl-2 gene and protein were exhibited in K562/AO2 cell compared with K562 cell. Basing on this, we hypothesized that the high expression of GCS gene which results in MDR of leukemia cell is correlated with Bcl-2 signal transduction. In order to validate the hypothesis, the inhibition of GCS gene in K562/AO2 cell was observed by using chemical suppressor PPMP and siRNA targeted at GCS, and applying RT-PCR and flow cytometry, the expression levels of apoptosis-related gene Bcl-2 and Bax were analyzed before and after inhibiting GCS gene in K562/AO2 cell. The results demonstrated that the gene and protein of Bcl-2 in K562/AO2 cell were both down-regulated significantly after GCS gene being inhibited; however, the Bax mRNA expression had no apparent change in different groups. This suggested that GCS gene may contributed to MDR of human leukemia cell K562/AO2 by Bcl-2 signal transduction.","['Liu, Yan', 'Xie, Ke-Ming', 'Yang, Guo-Qing', 'Bai, Xiao-Ming', 'Shi, Yuan-Ping', 'Mu, Hui-Jun', 'Qiao, Wei-Zhen', 'Zhang, Bin', 'Xie, Ping']","['Liu Y', 'Xie KM', 'Yang GQ', 'Bai XM', 'Shi YP', 'Mu HJ', 'Qiao WZ', 'Zhang B', 'Xie P']","['Wuxi Higher Health Vocational Technology School, Wuxi, Jiangsu, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20091124,Germany,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol,Cancer chemotherapy and pharmacology,7806519,"['0 (1-phenyl-2-palmitoylamino-3-morpholino-1-propanol)', '0 (Morpholines)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (Sphingolipids)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', 'EC 2.4.1.- (Glucosyltransferases)', 'EC 2.4.1.80 (ceramide glucosyltransferase)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*genetics', 'Down-Regulation', 'Drug Resistance, Multiple', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*genetics', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Glucosyltransferases/*genetics', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*genetics', 'Morpholines/pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*genetics', 'RNA, Messenger', 'RNA, Small Interfering/administration & dosage', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Signal Transduction/genetics', 'Sphingolipids/pharmacology', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein/genetics']",2009/11/26 06:00,2010/07/14 06:00,['2009/11/26 06:00'],"['2009/09/16 00:00 [received]', '2009/11/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/11/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/11/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/07/14 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00280-009-1177-4 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol. 2010 Aug;66(3):433-9. doi: 10.1007/s00280-009-1177-4.

In this study we examined the mechanism of aspirin-induced apoptosis in human leukemia cells. We analyzed the role of nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) and mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) pathways. Furthermore, we studied the changes induced by aspirin in some genes involved in the control of apoptosis at mRNA level, by performing reverse transcriptase multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (RT-MLPA), and at protein level by Western blot. Our results show that aspirin induced apoptosis in leukemia Jurkat T cells independently of NF-kappaB. Although aspirin induced p38 MAPK and c-Jun N-terminal kinase activation, selective inhibitors of these kinases did not inhibit aspirin-induced apoptosis. We studied the regulation of Bcl-2 family members in aspirin-induced apoptosis. Aspirin increased the mRNA levels of some pro-apoptotic members, such as BIM, NOXA, BMF or PUMA, but their protein levels did not change. In contrast, aspirin decreased the protein levels of Mcl-1. Interestingly, in the presence of aspirin the protein levels of Noxa remained high. This alteration of the Mcl-1/Noxa balance was also found in other leukemia cell lines and primary chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells (CLL). Furthermore, in CLL cells aspirin induced an increase in the protein levels of Noxa. Knockdown of Noxa or Puma significantly attenuated aspirin-induced apoptosis. These results indicate that aspirin induces apoptosis through alteration of the Mcl-1/ Noxa balance.","['Iglesias-Serret, Daniel', 'Pique, Maria', 'Barragan, Montserrat', 'Cosialls, Ana M', 'Santidrian, Antonio F', 'Gonzalez-Girones, Diana M', 'Coll-Mulet, Llorenc', 'de Frias, Merce', 'Pons, Gabriel', 'Gil, Joan']","['Iglesias-Serret D', 'Pique M', 'Barragan M', 'Cosialls AM', 'Santidrian AF', 'Gonzalez-Girones DM', 'Coll-Mulet L', 'de Frias M', 'Pons G', 'Gil J']","[""Unitat de Bioquimica, Departament de Ciencies Fisiologiques II, IDIBELL-Universitat de Barcelona, Campus de Bellvitge, C/Feixa Llarga s/n, Pavello de Govern, 4a planta, 08907 L'Hospitalet de Llobregat, Barcelona, Spain.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Netherlands,Apoptosis,Apoptosis : an international journal on programmed cell death,9712129,"['0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (BBC3 protein, human)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (PMAIP1 protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '9007-43-6 (Cytochromes c)', '98600C0908 (Cycloheximide)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.25 (MAP Kinase Kinase Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.25 (MAP3K8 protein, human)', 'R16CO5Y76E (Aspirin)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/metabolism', 'Aspirin/*pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cycloheximide/pharmacology', 'Cytochromes c/metabolism', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Humans', 'JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*enzymology/pathology', 'MAP Kinase Kinase Kinases/metabolism', 'Mitochondria/drug effects/metabolism', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/*metabolism', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'NF-kappa B/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*metabolism']",2009/11/26 06:00,2010/05/04 06:00,['2009/11/26 06:00'],"['2009/11/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/11/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/05/04 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s10495-009-0424-9 [doi]'],ppublish,Apoptosis. 2010 Feb;15(2):219-29. doi: 10.1007/s10495-009-0424-9.,15,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The aim of this study was to assess the HRQL of children with cancer in a developing country, using physician proxy assessments. METHODS: The Health Utilities Index (HUI) was chosen as the measurement tool and physicians' assessments were obtained using an HUI proxy-respondent interview-administered questionnaire. RESULTS: A total of 45 patients and their physicians (n=6) were recruited from 2 hospitals in Andhra Pradesh, India. Most of the children had acute lymphoblastic leukaemia. There were no differences in patterns observed between cancer types for the child's HRQL, but there was wide variation in the total HRQL scores among the children. This variation was more evident in certain aspects of children's life such as emotion and pain. CONCLUSION: This study has shown that HRQL as determined by physician proxy assessments in children with cancer in India is compromised, matching results in similar populations elsewhere.","['Chirivella, Susmitha', 'Rajappa, Senthil', 'Sinha, Sudha', 'Eden, Tim', 'Barr, Ronald D']","['Chirivella S', 'Rajappa S', 'Sinha S', 'Eden T', 'Barr RD']","['University of Aberdeen, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,India,Indian J Pediatr,Indian journal of pediatrics,0417442,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Female', '*Health Status', 'Humans', 'India', 'Male', '*Neoplasms', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma', '*Quality of Life']",2009/11/26 06:00,2010/04/22 06:00,['2009/11/26 06:00'],"['2008/09/18 00:00 [received]', '2009/05/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/11/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/11/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/04/22 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s12098-009-0262-3 [doi]'],ppublish,Indian J Pediatr. 2009 Dec;76(12):1231-5. doi: 10.1007/s12098-009-0262-3.,76,,['Indian J Pediatr. 2010 Jul;77(7):825; author reply 826.

Loss-of-function mutations cause critical telomere shortening and are associated with the bone marrow failure syndromes dyskeratosis congenita and aplastic anemia and with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. Here, we sought to determine the spectrum of clinical manifestations associated with telomerase loss-of-function mutations. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Sixty-nine individuals from five unrelated families with a variety of hematologic, hepatic, and autoimmune disorders were screened for telomerase complex gene mutations; leukocyte telomere length was measured by flow fluorescence in situ hybridization in mutation carriers and some non-carriers; the effects of the identified mutations on telomerase activity were determined; and genetic and clinical data were correlated. In six generations of a large family, a loss-of-function mutation in the telomerase enzyme gene TERT associated with severe telomere shortening and a range of hematologic manifestations, from macrocytosis to acute myeloid leukemia, with severe liver diseases marked by fibrosis and inflammation, and one case of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis but not with autoimmune disorders. Additionally, we identified four unrelated families in which loss-of-function TERC or TERT gene mutations tracked with marrow failure, pulmonary fibrosis, and a spectrum of liver disorders. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: These results indicate that heterozygous telomerase loss-of-function mutations associate with but are not determinant of a large spectrum of hematologic and liver abnormalities, with the latter sometimes occurring in the absence of marrow failure. Our findings, along with the link between pulmonary fibrosis and telomerase mutations, also suggest a common pathogenic mechanism for fibrotic diseases in which defective telomere repair plays important role.","['Calado, Rodrigo T', 'Regal, Joshua A', 'Kleiner, David E', 'Schrump, David S', 'Peterson, Nathan R', 'Pons, Veronica', 'Chanock, Stephen J', 'Lansdorp, Peter M', 'Young, Neal S']","['Calado RT', 'Regal JA', 'Kleiner DE', 'Schrump DS', 'Peterson NR', 'Pons V', 'Chanock SJ', 'Lansdorp PM', 'Young NS']","['Hematology Branch, National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, United States of America. calador@nhlbi.nih.gov']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20091120,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,['EC 2.7.7.49 (Telomerase)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Anemia, Aplastic/diagnosis/genetics', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Child', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', 'Dyskeratosis Congenita/diagnosis/genetics', 'Female', 'Heterozygote', 'Humans', 'Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis/diagnosis/genetics', 'Liver/abnormalities', 'Liver Diseases/*diagnosis/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Mutation', 'Telomerase/*genetics']",2009/11/26 06:00,2010/04/27 06:00,['2009/11/26 06:00'],"['2009/08/07 00:00 [received]', '2009/10/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/11/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/11/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/04/27 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1371/journal.pone.0007926 [doi]'],epublish,PLoS One. 2009 Nov 20;4(11):e7926. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0007926.,4,"['GMH79042/Canadian Institutes of Health Research/Canada', 'MOP38075/Canadian Institutes of Health Research/Canada', 'Intramural NIH HHS/United States']",,PMC2775683,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Monocyte differentiation-inducing (MDI) activity in culture supernatants is simultaneously increased by the virus infection. The MDI activity is predominantly influenced by IL-6 molecule in culture supernatants, and partly by TNF-alpha and IFN-beta, but not IFN-gamma, molecules. The MDI factors are able to induce the mRNA expression of macrophage class A scavenger receptor (SR-A), which is one of adhesion and apoptotic cell-recognizing molecules, and gp91(phox), which is a catalytic subunit of reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase enzyme complex, on monocytic cells. As a result, monocytes are initiated to differentiate into well-matured macrophages capable of adhering and producing superoxide through NADPH oxidase. The matured macrophages, obtained from human monocytic leukemia THP-1 cells by the treatment with MDI factors, phagocytose apoptotic chorion cell debris resulting from the virus infection. Subsequent to phagocytosis, an abrupt increase of superoxide production by macrophages may occur. In this article, we summarize recent knowledge about the MDI factors derived from human fetal membrane chorion cells undergoing apoptosis after influenza virus infection, and discuss their possible pathological roles during pregnancy.","['Uchide, Noboru', 'Toyoda, Hiroo']","['Uchide N', 'Toyoda H']","['Department of Clinical Molecular Genetics, School of Pharmacy, Tokyo University of Pharmacy and Life Sciences, 1432-1 Horinouchi, Hachioji, Tokyo 192-0392, Japan. uchide@ps.toyaku.ac.jp']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20071112,United States,Gene Regul Syst Bio,Gene regulation and systems biology,101312647,,,,2007/01/01 00:00,2007/01/01 00:01,['2009/11/26 06:00'],"['2009/11/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2007/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2007/01/01 00:01 [medline]']",['10.4137/grsb.s374 [doi]'],epublish,Gene Regul Syst Bio. 2007 Nov 12;1:295-302. doi: 10.4137/grsb.s374.,1,,,PMC2759142,,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Fetal membranes', 'apoptosis', 'cytokines', 'influenza virus', 'macrophages', 'phagocytosis']",,,,,,,,,,,

It is thus believed that targeted inhibition of hedgehog signaling may be effective in treatment and prevention of human cancer. Even more exciting is the discovery and synthesis of specific signaling antagonists for the hedgehog pathway, which have significant clinical implications in novel cancer therapeutics.

The former 3 are in first remission and both with biphenotypic leukemia relapsed with acute myeloid leukemia. The study primarily shows that cytochemical MPO expression in childhood acute leukemia revealing typical lymphoblastic morphology and phenotype does rarely exist.

DESIGN: Review of the literature regarding influenza A in these patient groups, and review of published and unpublished data with regard to novel influenza A (H1N1). MAIN RESULTS: Pregnant women are at increased risk for severe pneumonitis and respiratory failure from influenza infection, particularly during pandemics, including the current pandemic. Fetal morbidity is significant, usually resulting from maternal fever and severe hypoxemia. Early antiviral therapy using oseltamivir may be beneficial, and intensive care unit support should target adequate oxygenation at all times. Immunosuppressed patients are at increased risk for influenza, as well as at risk for more severe or prolonged infection. Patients after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, after lung transplantation, and those receiving chemotherapy for leukemia are at highest risk, whereas the risk for human immunodeficiency virus-infected individuals appears relatively low. Treatment with antiviral therapy may be beneficial, even after the usual cut-off of 48 hrs after symptom onset. CONCLUSIONS: Optimal management of these patients is preventive by influenza vaccination, but the neuraminidase inhibitor antiviral agents provide effective treatment.","['Lapinsky, Stephen E']",['Lapinsky SE'],"['Mount Sinai Hospital and the Interdepartmental Division of Critical Care, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada. stephen.lapinsky@utoronto.ca']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,Crit Care Med,Critical care medicine,0355501,"['0 (Antiviral Agents)', '0 (Influenza Vaccines)']",IM,"['Antiviral Agents/therapeutic use', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Female', 'Fetal Death', 'Humans', '*Immunocompromised Host', '*Influenza A Virus, H1N1 Subtype', 'Influenza Vaccines', 'Influenza, Human/*drug therapy/epidemiology/immunology', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Complications, Infectious/*drug therapy/epidemiology/immunology', 'Respiratory Insufficiency/therapy', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Severity of Illness Index']",2009/11/26 06:00,2010/04/22 06:00,['2009/11/26 06:00'],"['2009/11/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/11/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/04/22 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1097/CCM.0b013e3181c85d5f [doi]'],ppublish,Crit Care Med. 2010 Apr;38(4 Suppl):e52-7. doi: 10.1097/CCM.0b013e3181c85d5f.,38,,['Crit Care Med. 2010 Sep;38(9):1921; author reply 1921-2.

We aimed to determine the frequency, risk factors, and outcome of RSV infection in allo-HSCT recipients. DESIGN AND METHODS: Data were collected from 275 allo-HSCT recipients and identified 32 patients (11.6%, 26 adults and 6 children) RSV infection. A control group was selected matched for age, conditioning intensity and regimens, year of transplant. RESULTS: Eighteen patients had upper and 14 had lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI). The duration of viral shedding was long (20 days; 7-84). Twenty-eight patients received ribavirin (6 received intravenously, 11 orally, 9 both, 1 oral +aerosolized, and 1 received all three forms). The median duration of therapy was 22.5 days (7-54 days). Three (1.1% of entire cohort, 9.4% of infected patients; 21.4% of patients with LRTI) patients died from the RSV (attributable mortality), whereas two patients died from other subsequent infections 38 days to 5 months after diagnosis of RSV. Seven patients died from progression of underlying disease. Long-term respiratory function was assessed in 14 patients. Two patients died from respiratory failure. Three of 14 patients developed marked respiratory dysfunction after SCT. Three of 16 patients in the RSV group had normal respiratory function compared with 18 of 26 in the control group (P<0.01). CONCLUSION: RSV infection results in a low overall attributable mortality after allo-HSCT, but progression of the infection to LRTI is associated with increased risk for death. Late respiratory dysfunction is more common among patients, experienced RSV infection compared with controls.","['Avetisyan, Gayane', 'Mattsson, Jonas', 'Sparrelid, Elda', 'Ljungman, Per']","['Avetisyan G', 'Mattsson J', 'Sparrelid E', 'Ljungman P']","['Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden. gayane.avetisyan@ki.se']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Transplantation,Transplantation,0132144,"['0 (Aerosols)', '0 (Antiviral Agents)', '49717AWG6K (Ribavirin)']",IM,"['Administration, Inhalation', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aerosols', 'Aged', 'Antiviral Agents/therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease/epidemiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/surgery', 'Lymphoma/surgery', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Respiratory Syncytial Virus Infections/drug therapy/*epidemiology/mortality', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Ribavirin/administration & dosage/therapeutic use', 'Stem Cell Transplantation/*adverse effects', 'Transplantation, Homologous/*adverse effects', 'Treatment Outcome']",2009/11/26 06:00,2010/01/07 06:00,['2009/11/26 06:00'],"['2009/11/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/11/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/01/07 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1097/TP.0b013e3181bb477e [doi]', '00007890-200911270-00012 [pii]']",ppublish,Transplantation. 2009 Nov 27;88(10):1222-6. doi: 10.1097/TP.0b013e3181bb477e.,88,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Moreover, the mRNA translation process is mTORC1-independent in AML, although markedly contributing to oncogenesis in this disease, and this also strongly participates to rapalogs resistance. Translation inhibition could be achieved by directly targeting the translation initiating complex using the 4EGI-1 compound, anti-eIF4E antisense oligonucleotides or the antiviral drug ribavirin or by second generation mTOR inhibitors (TORkinhibs).

In the present study, we investigated the possibility of qualitative variability of signaling mechanisms controlling LFA-1 activation in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) cells. We pursued a multiplexed comparative analysis of the role of the recently described chemokine-triggered rho-signaling module in human normal versus CLL B-lymphocytes. We found that the rho-module of LFA-1 affinity triggering is functionally conserved in normal B-lymphocytes. In contrast, in malignant B-lymphocytes isolated from patients with B-CLL, the role of the rho-module was not maintained, showing remarkable differences and variability. Specifically, RhoA and phospholipase D1 were crucially involved in LFA-1 affinity triggering by CXCL12 in all analyzed patients. In contrast, Rac1 and CDC42 involvement displayed a consistent patient-by-patient variability, with a group of patients showing LFA-1 affinity modulation totally independent of Rac1 and CDC42 signaling activity. Finally, phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate 5-kinase isoform 1gamma (PIP5KC) was found without any regulatory role in all patients. The data imply that the neoplastic progression may completely bypass the regulatory role of Rac1, CDC42, and PIP5KC, and show a profound divergence in the signaling mechanisms controlling integrin activation in normal versus neoplastic lymphocytes, suggesting that patients with CLL can be more accurately evaluated on the basis of the analysis of signaling mechanisms controlling integrin activation. Our findings could potentially affect the diagnosis, prognosis, and therapy of CLL disorders.","['Montresor, Alessio', 'Bolomini-Vittori, Matteo', 'Simon, Scott I', 'Rigo, Antonella', 'Vinante, Fabrizio', 'Laudanna, Carlo']","['Montresor A', 'Bolomini-Vittori M', 'Simon SI', 'Rigo A', 'Vinante F', 'Laudanna C']","['Department of Pathology, University of Verona, Verona, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (CXCL12 protein, human)', '0 (Chemokine CXCL12)', '0 (Lymphocyte Function-Associated Antigen-1)', '0 (RAC1 protein, human)', 'EC 3.1.4.4 (Phospholipase D)', 'EC 3.1.4.4 (phospholipase D1)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (cdc42 GTP-Binding Protein)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (rac1 GTP-Binding Protein)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (rhoA GTP-Binding Protein)']",IM,"['B-Lymphocytes/cytology/*immunology', 'Chemokine CXCL12/immunology/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*immunology/pathology', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Lymphocyte Function-Associated Antigen-1/immunology/*metabolism', 'Phospholipase D/metabolism', 'cdc42 GTP-Binding Protein/metabolism', 'rac1 GTP-Binding Protein/metabolism', 'rhoA GTP-Binding Protein/metabolism']",2009/11/26 06:00,2010/01/06 06:00,['2009/11/26 06:00'],"['2009/11/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/11/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/01/06 06:00 [medline]']","['0008-5472.CAN-09-2009 [pii]', '10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-09-2009 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 2009 Dec 15;69(24):9281-90. doi: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-09-2009.,69,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Strategies to rescue antitumor activity of low-avidity melanoma-specific CTLs in vivo may improve immunotherapy efficacy. To boost the in vivo effectiveness of low-avidity CTLs, we immunized mice bearing lung melanoma metastases with artificial antigen-presenting cells (aAPC), made by covalently coupling (pep)MHC-Ig dimers and B7.1-Ig molecules to magnetic beads. aAPC treatment induced significant tumor reduction in a mouse telomerase antigen system, and complete tumor eradication in a mouse TRP-2 antigen system, when low-avidity CTLs specific for these antigens were adoptively transferred. In addition, in an in vivo treatment model of subcutaneous melanoma, aAPC injection also augmented the activity of adoptively transferred CTLs and significantly delayed tumor growth. In vivo tumor clearance due to aAPC administration correlated with in situ proliferation of the transferred CTL. In vitro studies showed that aAPC effectively stimulated cytokine release, enhanced CTL-mediated lysis, and TCR downregulation in low-avidity CTLs. Therefore, in vivo aAPC administration represents a potentially novel approach to improve cancer immunotherapy.","['Ugel, Stefano', 'Zoso, Alessia', 'De Santo, Carmela', 'Li, Yu', 'Marigo, Ilaria', 'Zanovello, Paola', 'Scarselli, Elisa', 'Cipriani, Barbara', 'Oelke, Mathias', 'Schneck, Jonathan P', 'Bronte, Vincenzo']","['Ugel S', 'Zoso A', 'De Santo C', 'Li Y', 'Marigo I', 'Zanovello P', 'Scarselli E', 'Cipriani B', 'Oelke M', 'Schneck JP', 'Bronte V']","['Department of Oncology, Oncology Section, Istituto di Ricovero e Cura a Carattere Scientifico, Padua, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",,United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,,IM,"['Animals', 'Antibody Affinity', 'Antigen-Presenting Cells/*immunology', 'Cell Growth Processes/immunology', 'Female', 'Immunotherapy, Adoptive/*methods', 'Leukemia, Experimental/immunology/*therapy', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Melanoma, Experimental/immunology/*therapy', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/immunology']",2009/11/26 06:00,2010/01/06 06:00,['2009/11/26 06:00'],"['2009/11/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/11/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/01/06 06:00 [medline]']","['0008-5472.CAN-09-0400 [pii]', '10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-09-0400 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 2009 Dec 15;69(24):9376-84. doi: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-09-0400.,69,"['R01 CA108835/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AI44129/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA108835-05/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AI044129/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AI044129-10/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States']",,PMC2825113,['NIHMS153958'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this context, gene expression signatures obtained by microarray represent a useful molecular diagnostic. Here, we describe novel probe-level microarray analyses that reveal connections between mRNA processing and neoplasia in multiple tumor types, with diagnostic potential. We now show that characteristic differences in mRNA processing, primarily in the 3'-untranslated region, define molecular signatures that can distinguish similar tumor subtypes with different survival characteristics, with at least 74% accuracy. Using a mouse model of B-cell leukemia/lymphoma, we find that differences in transcript isoform abundance are likely due to both alternative polyadenylation (APA) and differential degradation. While truncation of the 3'-UTR is the most common observed pattern, genes with elongated transcripts were also observed, and distinct groups of affected genes are found in related but distinct tumor types. Genes with elongated transcripts are overrepresented in ontology categories related to cell-cell adhesion and morphology. Analysis of microarray data from human primary tumor samples revealed similar phenomena. Western blot analysis of selected proteins confirms that changes in the 3'-UTR can correlate with changes in protein expression. Our work suggests that alternative mRNA processing, particularly APA, can be a powerful molecular biomarker with prognostic potential. Finally, these findings provide insights into the molecular mechanisms of gene deregulation in tumorigenesis.","['Singh, Priyam', 'Alley, Travis L', 'Wright, Sarah M', 'Kamdar, Sonya', 'Schott, William', 'Wilpan, Robert Y', 'Mills, Kevin D', 'Graber, Joel H']","['Singh P', 'Alley TL', 'Wright SM', 'Kamdar S', 'Schott W', 'Wilpan RY', 'Mills KD', 'Graber JH']","['The Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, Maine 04609, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",,United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"[""0 (3' Untranslated Regions)"", '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (Protein Isoforms)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)']",IM,"[""3' Untranslated Regions"", 'Animals', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/*genetics/metabolism/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Knockout', 'MicroRNAs/genetics', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Ovarian Neoplasms/genetics/metabolism', 'Protein Isoforms', 'RNA, Messenger/*genetics', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/deficiency']",2009/11/26 06:00,2010/01/06 06:00,['2009/11/26 06:00'],"['2009/11/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/11/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/01/06 06:00 [medline]']","['0008-5472.CAN-09-2236 [pii]', '10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-09-2236 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 2009 Dec 15;69(24):9422-30. doi: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-09-2236.,69,"['R01GM072706/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA034196/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01CA115665/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA115665/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', '2P30CA034196/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 GM072706/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 GM072706-04/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']",,PMC2794997,['NIHMS153990'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, complete eradication of the malignant clone by imatinib is rare. We investigated the efficacy of combining imatinib with cisplatin. Inhibition of Bcr-Abl by imatinib induced a hypersensitive phenotype both in Bcr-Abl(+) cell lines and in CD34(+) cells from CML patients. Importantly, cisplatin sensitivity of leukemic cells harboring an inactive Bcr-Abl greatly exceeded that of Bcr-Abl(-) parental cells. The cisplatin response of Bcr-Abl(+) cells treated with imatinib was characterized by an impaired G(2)-M arrest and by rapid induction of mitochondrial cell death after the first passage through G(2). Imatinib abrogated ATM activation on cisplatin selectively in Bcr-Abl(+) cells. As a consequence, phosphorylation of p53 on Ser(15) and its activity as a transcription factor was significantly diminished. Furthermore, p53 accumulated predominantly in the cytoplasm in Bcr-Abl(+) cells treated with imatinib and cisplatin. Silencing of p53 significantly reduced sensitivity to cisplatin in imatinib-treated Bcr-Abl(+) cells, indicating that p53 retains its proapoptotic activity. Simultaneous downregulation of Bcl-x(L) was an additional requirement for cisplatin hypersensitivity, as p53-dependent cell death could be antagonized by exogenous Bcl-x(L). We conclude that imatinib sensitizes Bcr-Abl(+) cells to cisplatin by simultaneous inhibition of p53 transactivation, induction of p53 accumulation predominantly in the cytoplasm, and reduction of Bcl-x(L).","['Skorta, Ioanna', 'Oren, Moshe', 'Markwardt, Christiane', 'Gutekunst, Matthias', 'Aulitzky, Walter E', 'van der Kuip, Heiko']","['Skorta I', 'Oren M', 'Markwardt C', 'Gutekunst M', 'Aulitzky WE', 'van der Kuip H']","['Dr Margarete-Fischer-Bosch Institute of Clinical Pharmacology and University of Tuebingen, Stuttgart, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (BCL2L1 protein, human)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (TP53 protein, human)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '0 (bcl-X Protein)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (ATM protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Atm protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'Q20Q21Q62J (Cisplatin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated Proteins', 'Benzamides', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects/genetics', 'Cell Cycle Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Cisplatin/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'DNA Damage/drug effects', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Drug Synergism', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/biosynthesis/genetics/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Mice', 'Myeloid Cells/drug effects', 'Piperazines/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Pyrimidines/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Transcription, Genetic/drug effects', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism/*physiology', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'bcl-X Protein/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism']",2009/11/26 06:00,2010/01/06 06:00,['2009/11/26 06:00'],"['2009/11/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/11/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/01/06 06:00 [medline]']","['0008-5472.CAN-09-0548 [pii]', '10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-09-0548 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 2009 Dec 15;69(24):9337-45. doi: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-09-0548.,69,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Despite this, the phenotype is not associated with primary resistant disease. We show defects in the response of mutant FLT3 AML cells to the S-phase drug clofarabine that could account for the apparent contradiction. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We studied responses of AML cells to clofarabine in vitro. RESULTS: When treated with a short pulse of clofarabine, FLT3-ITD-harboring MOLM-13 and MV4.11 cells undergo similar damage levels (gammaH2AX foci) to wild-type cells but have a better repair capability than wild-type cells. However, whereas the wild-type cells undergo rapid S-phase arrest, the S-phase checkpoint fails in mutant cells. Cell cycle arrest in response to DNA damage in S phase is effected via loss of the transcriptional regulator cdc25A. This loss is reduced or absent in clofarabine-treated FLT3 mutant cells. Furthermore, cdc25A message levels are maintained by the FLT3-ITD, such that message is reduced by 87.5% on exposure to FLT3 small interfering RNA. Primary FLT3-ITD samples from untreated patients also display impaired cell cycle arrest and show enhanced sensitivity on prolonged treatment with clofarabine compared with wild-type samples. CONCLUSION: There is a reversal of phenotype in mutant FLT3 cells dependent on the length of exposure to clofarabine. Efficient DNA repair may render the cells resistant to a short pulse of the drug, but a failure of cell cycle checkpoint(s) in S phase renders the cells sensitive to prolonged exposure.","['Seedhouse, Claire', 'Grundy, Martin', 'Shang, Shili', 'Ronan, John', 'Pimblett, Heather', 'Russell, Nigel', 'Pallis, Monica']","['Seedhouse C', 'Grundy M', 'Shang S', 'Ronan J', 'Pimblett H', 'Russell N', 'Pallis M']","['University of Nottingham, Nottingham, United Kingdom.

KRAS mutation in metastatic colorectal cancer predicts resistance to anti-epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-targeted therapy (cetuximab or panitumumab). It remains uncertain, however, whether KRAS mutation predicts prognosis or clinical outcome of colon cancer patients independent of anti-EGFR therapy. METHODS: We conducted a study of 508 cases identified among 1,264 patients with stage III colon cancer who enrolled in a randomized adjuvant chemotherapy trial (5-fluorouracil, leucovorin with or without irinotecan) in 1999-2001 (CALGB 89803). KRAS mutations were detected in 178 tumors (35%) by pyrosequencing. Kaplan-Meier and Cox proportional hazard models assessed the prognostic significance of KRAS mutation and adjusted for potential confounders including age, sex, tumor location, tumor/node stage, performance status, adjuvant chemotherapy arm, and microsatellite instability status. RESULTS: Compared with patients with KRAS-wild-type tumors, patients with KRAS-mutated tumors did not experience any difference in disease-free, recurrence-free, or overall survival. The 5-year disease-free, recurrence-free, and overall survival rates (KRAS-mutated versus KRAS-wild-type patients) were 62% versus 63% (log-rank P = 0.89), 64% versus 66% (P = 0.84), and 75% versus 73% (P = 0.56), respectively. The effect of KRAS mutation on patient survival did not significantly differ according to clinical features, chemotherapy arm, or microsatellite instability status, and the effect of adjuvant chemotherapy assignment on outcome did not differ according to KRAS status. CONCLUSIONS: In this large trial of chemotherapy in stage III colon cancer patients, KRAS mutational status was not associated with any significant influence on disease-free or overall survival.","['Ogino, Shuji', 'Meyerhardt, Jeffrey A', 'Irahara, Natsumi', 'Niedzwiecki, Donna', 'Hollis, Donna', 'Saltz, Leonard B', 'Mayer, Robert J', 'Schaefer, Paul', 'Whittom, Renaud', 'Hantel, Alexander', 'Benson, Al B 3rd', 'Goldberg, Richard M', 'Bertagnolli, Monica M', 'Fuchs, Charles S']","['Ogino S', 'Meyerhardt JA', 'Irahara N', 'Niedzwiecki D', 'Hollis D', 'Saltz LB', 'Mayer RJ', 'Schaefer P', 'Whittom R', 'Hantel A', 'Benson AB 3rd', 'Goldberg RM', 'Bertagnolli MM', 'Fuchs CS']","['Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts 02115, USA. shuji_ogino@dfci.harvard.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20091124,United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '7673326042 (Irinotecan)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (Oncogene Protein p21(ras))', 'XT3Z54Z28A (Camptothecin)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Camptothecin/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Colonic Neoplasms/drug therapy/*genetics/*metabolism/surgery', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', '*Genes, ras', 'Humans', 'Irinotecan', 'Male', 'Microsatellite Repeats', 'Middle Aged', '*Mutation', 'Oncogene Protein p21(ras)/*genetics', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'Treatment Outcome']",2009/11/26 06:00,2010/03/10 06:00,['2009/11/26 06:00'],"['2009/11/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/11/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/03/10 06:00 [medline]']","['1078-0432.CCR-09-1570 [pii]', '10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-09-1570 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2009 Dec 1;15(23):7322-9. doi: 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-09-1570.

METHODS: Among 280 consecutive nonimmunocompromised patients hospitalized between 1995 and 2005 for a febrile illness of uncertain cause, lasting at least 3 weeks, with no diagnosis after an appropriate minimal diagnostic workup, 130 underwent BMB. RESULTS: Overall, a specific diagnosis was achieved by BMB and histological examination in 31 cases (diagnostic yield, 23.7%). Three types of diseases were found: hematological malignant diseases in 25 cases, including 19 patients with malignant lymphoma, 4 with acute leukemia, 1 with hairy cell leukemia, and 1 with multiple myeloma; infectious diseases in 3 cases; systemic mastocytosis in 2 cases; and disseminated granulomatosis in 1 case. Thrombocytopenia (odds ratio, 4.9; 95% confidence interval, 1.04-9.30) and anemia (odds ratio, 3.24; 95% CI, 1.13-9.34) were the most reliable predictive factors regarding the usefulness of BMB. Bone marrow cultures had very limited value in our cohort. Finally, corticosteroid use did not seem to affect the yield of BMB. CONCLUSIONS: Bone marrow biopsy is a useful technique for the diagnosis of prolonged fever in immunocompetent patients. Thrombocytopenia and anemia seem to be correlated with the value of this test.","['Hot, Arnaud', 'Jaisson, Isabelle', 'Girard, Charlotte', 'French, Martine', 'Durand, Denis Vital', 'Rousset, Hugues', 'Ninet, Jacques']","['Hot A', 'Jaisson I', 'Girard C', 'French M', 'Durand DV', 'Rousset H', 'Ninet J']","[""Service de Medecine Interne, Hopital Edouard Herriot, 5 Place d'Arsonval, 69437 Lyon CEDEX 03, France. arnaud.hot@wanadoo.fr.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Arch Intern Med,Archives of internal medicine,0372440,['0 (Adrenal Cortex Hormones)'],IM,"['Adrenal Cortex Hormones/adverse effects', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', '*Biopsy', '*Bone Marrow/drug effects', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Female', 'Fever of Unknown Origin/*etiology', 'Humans', 'Infections/diagnosis', 'Inflammation/diagnosis', 'Leukemia/diagnosis', 'Lymphoma/diagnosis', 'Male', 'Medical Records', 'Middle Aged', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Neoplasms/diagnosis', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Factors']",2009/11/26 06:00,2009/12/16 06:00,['2009/11/26 06:00'],"['2009/11/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/11/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2009/12/16 06:00 [medline]']","['169/21/2018 [pii]', '10.1001/archinternmed.2009.401 [doi]']",ppublish,Arch Intern Med. 2009 Nov 23;169(21):2018-23. doi: 10.1001/archinternmed.2009.401.,169,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: To define the dose-limiting toxicities (DLT) and maximum-tolerated dose (MTD) of sapacitabine given orally twice daily for 7 days every 3 to 4 weeks, or twice daily for 3 days for 2 weeks (days 1 through 3 and days 8 through 10) every 3 to 4 weeks, in refractory-relapse acute leukemia and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). A total of 47 patients were treated in the phase I study that used a classical 3 + 3 design. Sapacitabine was escalated from 75 to 375 mg twice daily for 7 days (n = 35) and from 375 to 475 mg twice daily for 3 days on days 1 through 3 and days 8 through 10. RESULTS: The DLTs with both schedules were gastrointestinal. The MTDs were 375 mg twice daily for 7 days and 425 mg twice daily for 3 days on days 1 through 3 and days 8 through 10. The recommended phase II single-agent dose schedules were 325 mg twice daily for 7 days and 425 mg twice daily for 3 days on days 1 through 3 and days 8 through 10. Responses were observed in 13 patients (28%); four were complete responses, and nine were marrow complete responses. CONCLUSION: Sapacitabine is a new, safely administered, oral deoxycytidine analog that has encouraging activity in leukemia and MDS.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Cancer and Leukemia Group B trial 39904 prospectively assessed accelerated, once-daily, three-dimensional radiotherapy for early-stage NSCLC. The primary objectives were to define the maximally accelerated course of conformal radiotherapy and to describe the short-term and long-term toxicity of therapy. Entry was limited to patients with clinical stage T1N0 or T2N0 NSCLC (< 4 cm) and pulmonary dysfunction. The nominal total radiotherapy dose remained at 70 Gy, while the number of daily fractions in each successive cohort was reduced. RESULTS: Thirty-nine eligible patients were accrued (eight patients each on cohorts 1 to 4 and seven patients on cohort 5) between January 2001 and July 2005. One grade 3 nonhematologic toxicity was observed in both cohort 3 (dyspnea) and cohort 4 (pain). The major response rate was 77%. After a median follow-up time of 53 months, the actuarial median survival time of all eligible patients was 38.5 months. Local relapse was observed in three patients. CONCLUSION: Accelerated conformal radiotherapy was well tolerated in a high-risk population with clinical stage I NSCLC. Outcomes are comparable to prospective reports of alternative therapies, including stereotactic body radiation therapy and limited resection, with less apparent severe toxicity. Further investigation of this approach is warranted.","['Bogart, Jeffrey A', 'Hodgson, Lydia', 'Seagren, Stephen L', 'Blackstock, A William', 'Wang, Xiaofei', 'Lenox, Robert', 'Turrisi, Andrew T 3rd', 'Reilly, John', 'Gajra, Ajeet', 'Vokes, Everett E', 'Green, Mark R']","['Bogart JA', 'Hodgson L', 'Seagren SL', 'Blackstock AW', 'Wang X', 'Lenox R', 'Turrisi AT 3rd', 'Reilly J', 'Gajra A', 'Vokes EE', 'Green MR']","['Department of Radiation Oncology, State University of New York Upstate Medical University, 750 E Adams St, Syracuse NY 13210, USA. bogartj@upstate.edu']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial, Phase I', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20091123,United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,,IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung/complications/*radiotherapy', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Lung Diseases/*complications', 'Lung Neoplasms/complications/*radiotherapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Radiotherapy Dosage', 'Radiotherapy, Conformal/*methods']",2009/11/26 06:00,2010/01/22 06:00,['2009/11/26 06:00'],"['2009/11/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/11/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/01/22 06:00 [medline]']","['JCO.2009.25.0753 [pii]', '10.1200/JCO.2009.25.0753 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2010 Jan 10;28(2):202-6. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2009.25.0753.

Transplanting lineage(-)CD11c(+)CD11b(-) APC (CD11b(-) APC) in combination with c-kit(+)Sca-1(+)lineage(-) hemopoietic stem cells (HSC) and congenic donor T cells led to increased donor CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cell proliferation and higher donor T cell chimerism than with transplanting grafts containing HSC, T cells, and lineage(-)CD11c(+)CD11b(+) APCs (CD11b(+) APC), or grafts containing only HSC and T cells. Transplanting CD11b(-) APCs induced Th1/type 1 cytotoxic T lymphocyte donor T cell immune polarization and enhanced GvL activity of donor T cells without increased graft-vs-host disease in both MHC- and minor histocompatibility Ag-mismatched murine hemopoietic stem cell transplantation models, whereas CD11b(+) APCs led to Th2/type 2 cytotoxic T lymphocyte donor T cell immune polarization.

The survival of pro-T cells and mature T cells requires IL-7. The survival function of IL-7 is accomplished partly through induction of the antiapoptotic protein Bcl-2 and inhibition of proapoptotic proteins Bax and Bad. We show here that the proapoptotic protein Bim, a BH3-only protein belonging to the Bcl-2 family, also plays a role in peripheral T-cell survival. Deletion of Bim partially protected an IL-7-dependent T-cell line and peripheral T cells, especially cells with an effector memory phenotype, from IL-7 deprivation. However, T-cell development in the thymus was not restored in IL-7(-/-) Rag2(-/-) mice reconstituted with Bim(-/-) bone marrow. IL-7 withdrawal altered neither the intracellular location of Bim, which was constitutively mitochondrial, nor its association with Bcl-2; however, a reduction in its association with the prosurvival protein Mcl-1 was observed. IL-7 withdrawal did not increase Bim mRNA or protein expression but did induce changes in the isoelectric point of Bim(EL) and its reactivity with an antiphosphoserine antibody. Our findings suggest that the maintenance of peripheral T cells by IL-7 occurs partly through inhibition of Bim activity at the posttranslational level.","['Li, Wen Qing', 'Guszczynski, Tad', 'Hixon, Julie A', 'Durum, Scott K']","['Li WQ', 'Guszczynski T', 'Hixon JA', 'Durum SK']","['Section of Cytokines and Immunity, National Cancer Institute, Frederick, MD 21702-1201, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural']",20091123,United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,"['0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (Bcl-2-Like Protein 11)', '0 (Bcl2l11 protein, mouse)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Interleukin-7)', '0 (Mcl1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Rag2 protein, mouse)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)']",IM,"['Adoptive Transfer', 'Animals', 'Apoptosis/*immunology', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Bcl-2-Like Protein 11', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Survival/physiology', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Interleukin-7/genetics/*metabolism', 'Membrane Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*metabolism', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/genetics/metabolism']",2009/11/26 06:00,2010/02/18 06:00,['2009/11/26 06:00'],"['2009/11/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/11/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/02/18 06:00 [medline]']","['MCB.01006-09 [pii]', '10.1128/MCB.01006-09 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 2010 Feb;30(3):590-600. doi: 10.1128/MCB.01006-09.

Our previous observations demonstrated that acquired tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand resistance in lung cancer cells was associated with Akt-mediated stabilization of cellular FLICE-like inhibitory protein (c-FLIP) and Mcl-1. In this report, we determined that these cells also have acquired resistance to apoptosis induced by chemotherapeutics such as cisplatin and doxorubicin (Adriamycin), which was detected in vitro in cell cultures and in vivo in xenografted tumors. We further found that cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) is dramatically overexpressed in cells with acquired apoptosis resistance. COX-2 seems to be a crucial mediator in acquired apoptosis resistance because suppressing COX-2 activity with a chemical inhibitor or reducing COX-2 protein expression level with COX-2 small interfering RNA dramatically alleviated resistance to therapeutic-induced apoptosis. Inhibiting Akt markedly suppressed COX-2 expression, suggesting COX-2 is a downstream effector of this cell survival kinase-mediated apoptosis resistance. Furthermore, the expression of Mcl-1 but not c-FLIP was significantly reduced when COX-2 was suppressed, and knockdown of Mcl-1 substantially sensitized the cells to apoptosis. Our results establish a novel pathway that consists of Akt, COX-2, and Mcl-1 for acquired apoptosis resistance, which could be a molecular target for circumventing acquired chemoresistance in lung cancer.","['Chen, Wenjie', 'Bai, Lang', 'Wang, Xia', 'Xu, Shanling', 'Belinsky, Steven A', 'Lin, Yong']","['Chen W', 'Bai L', 'Wang X', 'Xu S', 'Belinsky SA', 'Lin Y']","['Molecular Biology and Lung Cancer Program, Lovelace Respiratory Research Institute, 2425 Ridgecrest Dr., SE, Albuquerque, NM 87108, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",20091123,United States,Mol Pharmacol,Molecular pharmacology,0035623,"['0 (Mcl1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', 'EC 1.14.99.1 (Cyclooxygenase 2)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/drug effects/*physiology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cyclooxygenase 2/*metabolism/physiology', 'Doxorubicin/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*physiology', 'Enzyme Activation/physiology', 'Humans', 'Lung Neoplasms/enzymology/*metabolism/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Nude', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/*metabolism/physiology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*metabolism/physiology', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects/*physiology']",2009/11/26 06:00,2010/03/20 06:00,['2009/11/26 06:00'],"['2009/11/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/11/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/03/20 06:00 [medline]']","['mol.109.061226 [pii]', '10.1124/mol.109.061226 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Pharmacol. 2010 Mar;77(3):416-23. doi: 10.1124/mol.109.061226.

To identify the regulatory role for NPM phosphorylation in proliferation and cell cycle control, a series of mutants targeting the consensus cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) phosphorylation sites was created to mimic or abrogate either single-site or multi-site phosphorylation. Simultaneous inactivation of two CDK phosphorylation sites at Ser10 and Ser70 (NPM-AA) induced G(2)/M cell cycle arrest, phosphorylation of Cdk1 at Tyr15 (Cdc2(Tyr15)) and increased cytoplasmic accumulation of Cdc25C. Strikingly, stress-induced Cdk1(Tyr15) and Cdc25C sequestration was suppressed by expression of a phosphomimetic NPM mutant created on the same CDK sites (S10E/S70E, NPM-EE). Further analysis revealed that phosphorylation of NPM at both Ser10 and Ser70 was required for proper interaction between Cdk1 and Cdc25C. Moreover, NPM-EE directly bound to Cdc25C and prevented phosphorylation of Cdc25C at Ser216 during mitosis. Finally, NPM-EE overrided stress-induced G(2)/M arrest and increased leukemia blasts in a NOD/SCID xenograft model. Thus, these findings reveal a novel function of NPM on regulation of cell cycle progression, in which phosphorylation of NPM controls cell cycle progression at G(2)/M transition through modulation of Cdk1 and Cdc25C activities.","['Du, Wei', 'Zhou, Yun', 'Pike, Suzette', 'Pang, Qishen']","['Du W', 'Zhou Y', 'Pike S', 'Pang Q']","[""Division of Experimental Hematology and Cancer Biology, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati, OH 45229, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20091123,England,Carcinogenesis,Carcinogenesis,8008055,"['0 (NPM1 protein, human)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '117896-08-9 (Nucleophosmin)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (CDC2 Protein Kinase)']",IM,"['Animals', 'CDC2 Protein Kinase/*metabolism', '*Cell Division', 'Cell Proliferation', '*G2 Phase', 'Immunoblotting', 'Immunoprecipitation', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mice, SCID', 'Mitotic Index', 'Nuclear Proteins/*metabolism', 'Nucleophosmin', 'Phosphorylation', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*metabolism/*pathology']",2009/11/26 06:00,2010/03/05 06:00,['2009/11/26 06:00'],"['2009/11/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/11/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/03/05 06:00 [medline]']","['bgp270 [pii]', '10.1093/carcin/bgp270 [doi]']",ppublish,Carcinogenesis. 2010 Feb;31(2):302-10. doi: 10.1093/carcin/bgp270.

We investigated the relation of mortality to work practices and formaldehyde exposure levels among these professionals to address cancer risk in the funeral industry. METHODS: Professionals employed in the funeral industry who died between January 1, 1960, and January 1, 1986, from lymphohematopoietic malignancies (n = 168) or brain tumors (n = 48) (ie, case subjects) were compared with deceased matched control subjects (n = 265) with regard to lifetime work practices and exposures in the funeral industry, which were obtained by interviews with next of kin and coworkers, and to estimated levels of formaldehyde exposure. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated by use of logistic regression. All statistical tests were two-sided. RESULTS: Mortality from myeloid leukemia increased statistically significantly with increasing number of years of embalming (P for trend = .020) and with increasing peak formaldehyde exposure (P for trend = .036). Compared with subjects who performed fewer than 500 lifetime embalmings, mortality from myeloid leukemia was elevated among those who performed embalmings for more than 34 years (OR = 3.9, 95% CI = 1.2 to 12.5, P = .024), who performed more than 3068 embalmings (OR = 3.0, 95% CI = 1.0 to 9.2, P = .057), and those whose estimated cumulative formaldehyde exposure exceeded 9253 parts per million-hours (OR = 3.1; 95% CI = 1.0 to 9.6, P = .047). These exposures were not related to other lymphohematopoietic malignancies or to brain cancer. CONCLUSION: Duration of embalming practice and related formaldehyde exposures in the funeral industry were associated with statistically significantly increased risk for mortality from myeloid leukemia.","['Hauptmann, Michael', 'Stewart, Patricia A', 'Lubin, Jay H', 'Beane Freeman, Laura E', 'Hornung, Richard W', 'Herrick, Robert F', 'Hoover, Robert N', 'Fraumeni, Joseph F Jr', 'Blair, Aaron', 'Hayes, Richard B']","['Hauptmann M', 'Stewart PA', 'Lubin JH', 'Beane Freeman LE', 'Hornung RW', 'Herrick RF', 'Hoover RN', 'Fraumeni JF Jr', 'Blair A', 'Hayes RB']","['Department of Bioinformatics and Statistics, Netherlands Cancer Institute, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural']",,United States,J Natl Cancer Inst,Journal of the National Cancer Institute,7503089,"['0 (Fixatives)', '1HG84L3525 (Formaldehyde)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Brain Neoplasms/chemically induced/*mortality', 'Female', 'Fixatives/*adverse effects', 'Formaldehyde/*adverse effects', '*Funeral Rites', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/chemically induced/*mortality', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/mortality', 'Lymphoma/chemically induced/*mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Nasopharyngeal Neoplasms/mortality', 'Occupational Diseases/chemically induced/*mortality', 'Occupational Exposure/*adverse effects']",2009/11/26 06:00,2009/12/30 06:00,['2009/11/26 06:00'],"['2009/11/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/11/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2009/12/30 06:00 [medline]']","['djp416 [pii]', '10.1093/jnci/djp416 [doi]']",ppublish,J Natl Cancer Inst. 2009 Dec 16;101(24):1696-708. doi: 10.1093/jnci/djp416.,101,['Intramural NIH HHS/United States'],"['J Natl Cancer Inst. 2010 Oct 6;102(19):1518-9; author reply 1519-20.

Accurate classification depends upon the method used to identify the most relevant genes. Owing to the large number of genes and relatively small sample size, the selection process can be unstable. Modification of existing methods for achieving better analysis of microarray data is needed. RESULTS: We propose a Bayesian stochastic variable selection approach for gene selection based on a probit regression model with a generalized singular g-prior distribution for regression coefficients. Using simulation-based Markov chain Monte Carlo methods for simulating parameters from the posterior distribution, an efficient and dependable algorithm is implemented. It is also shown that this algorithm is robust to the choices of initial values, and produces posterior probabilities of related genes for biological interpretation. The performance of the proposed approach is compared with other popular methods in gene selection and classification via the well-known colon cancer and leukemia datasets in microarray literature.

As compared to its parental compound didemnin B, plitidepsin has shown a better therapeutic index with less bone marrow toxicity, cardiotoxicity and neurotoxicity in patients and a more potent cytotoxic effect in several tumor cell lines. As sensitivity to the drug varies between cell lines and fresh leukemia samples, we performed studies on transport of plitidepsin in leukemia and lymphoma cell lines to determine the mechanism of uptake. The drug is taken up by an active transport process, i.e. the process is temperature and energy dependent, and has a high-affinity binding site with Kt =212 nM and Vmax = 15 pmoles/min. Importantly, once inside the cell, efflux of plitidepsin is minimum, suggesting that the drug is bound to intracellular macromolecules. Further work showed that plitidepsin binds to G-Protein Coupled Receptors (GPCRs), since GPCR and GRK (GPCR kinases) inhibitors suramin and heparin respectively, markedly reduce the drug uptake and its cytotoxic activity. Signaling via Jak/Stat pathway is inhibited by pharmacological concentrations of plitidepsin, further confirming the relationship between plitidepsin and GPCRs.","['Longo-Sorbello, G S A', 'Gao, H', 'Mishra, P J', 'Kamen, B', 'Soto, A', 'Jimeno, J', 'Aracil, M', 'Paz de Paz, M F', 'Bertino, J R', 'Banerjee, D']","['Longo-Sorbello GS', 'Gao H', 'Mishra PJ', 'Kamen B', 'Soto A', 'Jimeno J', 'Aracil M', 'Paz de Paz MF', 'Bertino JR', 'Banerjee D']","['Department of Medicine and Pharmacology, Robert Wood Johnson Medical School, Cancer Institute of New Jersey, University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersy, New Brunswick, NJ 08903, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,England,J Chemother,"Journal of chemotherapy (Florence, Italy)",8907348,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Depsipeptides)', '0 (Peptides, Cyclic)', '0 (Potassium Channel Blockers)', '0 (Potassium Channels)', '0 (Receptors, G-Protein-Coupled)', '0 (STAT Transcription Factors)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '6032D45BEM (Suramin)', '8L70Q75FXE (Adenosine Triphosphate)', '9005-49-6 (Heparin)', 'BH3B64OKL9 (4-Aminopyridine)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'Y76ID234HW (plitidepsin)']",IM,"['4-Aminopyridine/pharmacology', 'Adenosine Triphosphate/metabolism', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/pharmacology', 'Biological Transport, Active', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cytarabine/pharmacology', 'Depsipeptides/*metabolism', 'Heparin/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Membrane Microdomains/*metabolism', 'Peptides, Cyclic', 'Potassium Channel Blockers/pharmacology', 'Potassium Channels/drug effects', 'Receptors, G-Protein-Coupled/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'STAT Transcription Factors/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Subcellular Fractions', 'Suramin/*pharmacology', 'Time Factors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/metabolism']",2009/11/26 06:00,2010/02/03 06:00,['2009/11/26 06:00'],"['2009/11/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/11/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/02/03 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1179/joc.2009.21.5.550 [doi]'],ppublish,J Chemother. 2009 Nov;21(5):550-7. doi: 10.1179/joc.2009.21.5.550.,21,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We hypothesized that superior unit quality, as measured by a higher percentage of viable cells postthaw, would determine the engrafting unit. Therefore, we prospectively analyzed 46 double-unit transplants postthaw using flow cytometry with modified gating that included all dead cells. Using a 75% threshold (mean viability minus 2 SD), 20% of units had low CD34+ cell viability, with viability varying according to the bank of origin. Further, in the 44 patients with single unit engraftment, CD34+ cell viability was higher in engrafting units (P=.0016). Although either unit engrafted if both had high CD34+ viability, units with <75% viability were very unlikely to engraft: in 16 patients who received one high and one low CD34+ viability unit, only 1 of 16 units with viability <75% engrafted (P=.0006). Further, in the single patient without engraftment of either unit, both had CD34+ viability <75%. Finally, poor CD34+ viability correlated with lower colony forming units (CFUs) (P=.02). Our data suggests one mechanism by which double unit CBT can improve engraftment is by increasing the probability of transplanting at least one unit with adequate viability and the potential to engraft.","['Scaradavou, Andromachi', 'Smith, Katherine M', 'Hawke, Rebecca', 'Schaible, Allison', 'Abboud, Michelle', 'Kernan, Nancy A', 'Young, James W', 'Barker, Juliet N']","['Scaradavou A', 'Smith KM', 'Hawke R', 'Schaible A', 'Abboud M', 'Kernan NA', 'Young JW', 'Barker JN']","['Department of Pediatrics, Allogeneic Bone Marrow Transplant Service, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, 1275 York Ave., New York, NY 10021, USA. scaradaa@mskcc.org']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20091122,United States,Biol Blood Marrow Transplant,Biology of blood and marrow transplantation : journal of the American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation,9600628,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antigens, CD34/*blood/immunology', 'Blood Preservation', 'Cell Survival/immunology', 'Child', 'Cord Blood Stem Cell Transplantation/*methods', 'Female', 'Fetal Blood/cytology/*immunology', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/blood/therapy', 'Lymphoma/blood/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Postoperative Complications', 'Prospective Studies', 'Transplantation Conditioning', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Young Adult']",2009/11/26 06:00,2010/09/29 06:00,['2009/11/26 06:00'],"['2009/08/13 00:00 [received]', '2009/11/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/11/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/11/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/09/29 06:00 [medline]']","['S1083-8791(09)00530-8 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bbmt.2009.11.013 [doi]']",ppublish,Biol Blood Marrow Transplant. 2010 Apr;16(4):500-8. doi: 10.1016/j.bbmt.2009.11.013.

We have observed that several metabolites of benzene have the ability to block gap junction intercellular communication. The ring-opened trans,trans-muconaldehyde (MUC) was found to be the most potent inhibitor of gap junction channels. MUC was found to induce cross-linking of the gap junction protein connexin43, which seemed to be responsible for the induced inhibition of GJIC. Glutaraldehyde, which has a similar molecular structure as MUC, was found to possess similar effects on gap junctions as MUC, while the mono-aldehyde formaldehyde shows lower potency, both as a connexin cross-linker, and as an inhibitor of GJIC. Both glutaraldehyde and formaldehyde have previously been associated with induction of leukemia and disturbance of hematopoiesis.

However, despite many childhood cancers having a male predominance and boys generally weighing more than girls at birth few studies have reported sex-specific associations. The relationship between birth weight and childhood cancer risk was examined using information from a national case-control study. Children (0-14 years) newly diagnosed with cancer in GB were ascertained between 1991 and 1996 (n=3651) and for comparison, controls matched on sex, month and year of birth were identified from primary care population registers (n=6337). Birth weights were obtained from the Office of National Statistics for all targeted subjects born in England and Wales. Overall, cases were, on average, 30 g heavier at birth than controls (p=0.003) with differences seen by cancer type; those diagnosed with hepatic tumours weighing around 500 g less than controls at birth (p<0.0001) and those with leukaemia being, on average, 50 g heavier than those without (p=0.001). An interaction between birth weight and sex was found for acute leukaemia (chi(2)=11.2, p=0.04) and when data were stratified by sex, an association between high birth weight and risk of ALL was seen with girls (>4000 g, OR 1.86, 95% CI 1.38-2.50, chi(2) for trend 20.2, p<0.0001). Our results support the hypothesis that birth weight is an important determinant for childhood cancer. In addition, the data are consistent with the notion that childhood leukaemia has a prenatal origin.","['Smith, Alexandra', 'Lightfoot, Tracy', 'Simpson, Jill', 'Roman, Eve']","['Smith A', 'Lightfoot T', 'Simpson J', 'Roman E']","['Epidemiology & Genetics Unit, Department of Health Sciences and Hull & York Medical School, University of York, York, UK. alex.smith@egu.york.ac.uk']",['eng'],"['Historical Article', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20091122,Netherlands,Cancer Epidemiol,Cancer epidemiology,101508793,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Birth Weight/*physiology', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'History, Ancient', 'Humans', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/*epidemiology', 'Registries', 'Risk Factors', 'Sex Factors', 'United Kingdom/epidemiology']",2009/11/26 06:00,2010/02/03 06:00,['2009/11/26 06:00'],"['2009/05/27 00:00 [received]', '2009/10/14 00:00 [revised]', '2009/10/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/11/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/11/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/02/03 06:00 [medline]']","['S1877-7821(09)00141-6 [pii]', '10.1016/j.canep.2009.10.012 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Epidemiol. 2009 Nov;33(5):363-7. doi: 10.1016/j.canep.2009.10.012.

To gain further insights into these interactions, we investigated the effect of PFOS potassium salt on dimyristoyl- (DMPC), dipalmitoyl- (DPPC) and distearoylphosphatidylcholine (DSPC) model membranes using fluorescence anisotropy measurements and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and on the cell membrane of HL-60 human leukemia cells and freshly isolated rat alveolar macrophages using fluorescence anisotropy measurements. PFOS produced a concentration-dependent decrease of the main phase transition temperature (T(m)) and an increased peak width (DeltaT(w)) in both the fluorescence anisotropy and the DSC experiments, with a rank order DMPC>DPPC>DSPC. PFOS caused a fluidization of the gel phase of all phosphatidylcholines investigated, but had the opposite effect on the liquid-crystalline phase. The apparent partition coefficients of PFOS between the phosphatidylcholine bilayer and the bulk aqueous phase were largely independent of the phosphatidylcholine chain length and ranged from 4.4x10(4) to 8.8x10(4). PFOS also significantly increased the fluidity of membranes of cells. These findings suggest that PFOS readily partitions into lipid assemblies, independent of their composition, and may cause adverse biological effects by altering their fluidity in a manner that depends on the membrane cooperativity and state (e.g., gel versus liquid-crystalline phase) of the lipid assembly.","['Xie, Wei', 'Ludewig, Gabriele', 'Wang, Kai', 'Lehmler, Hans-Joachim']","['Xie W', 'Ludewig G', 'Wang K', 'Lehmler HJ']","['Department of Occupational and Environmental Health, University of Iowa, College of Public Health, Iowa City, IA 52242-5000, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20091027,Netherlands,Colloids Surf B Biointerfaces,"Colloids and surfaces.

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Human umbilical vascular endothelial cells (HUVECs) were irradiated with different doses to induce IL-6. The IL-6 promoter assay and reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) were used to examine transcriptional regulation. Specific chemical inhibitors, decoy double-stranded oligodeoxynucleotides, and Western blotting were conducted to investigate the signal transduction pathway. Recombinant soluble human IL-6 receptor alpha-chain (sIL6-Ralpha) and specific small interfering RNA were used to evaluate the biologic function of radiation-induced IL-6. RESULTS: Four grays of radiation induced the highest level of IL-6 protein. The promoter assay and RT-PCR data revealed that the induction of IL-6 was mediated through transcriptional regulation. The p38 inhibitor SB203580, by blocking nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) activation, prevented both the transcriptional and translational regulation of radiation-induced IL-6 expression. The addition of sIL6-Ralpha rescued HUVECs from radiation-induced death in an IL-6 concentratio-dependent manner. The antiapoptotic effect of combined sIL6-Ralpha and radiation-induced IL-6 was inhibited by mcl-1-specific small interfering RNA. CONCLUSION: Radiation transcriptionally induces IL-6 expression in endothelial cells through mitogen-activated protein kinase/p38-mediated NF-kappaB/IkappaB (inhibitor of NF-kappaB) complex activation. In the presence of sIL6-Ralpha, radiation-induced IL-6 expression acts through Mcl-1 expression to rescue endothelial cells from radiation-induced death.","['Chou, Chia-Hung', 'Chen, Shee-Uan', 'Cheng, Jason Chia-Hsien']","['Chou CH', 'Chen SU', 'Cheng JC']","['Graduate Institute of Oncology, National Taiwan University College of Medicine, Taipei, Taiwan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys,"International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics",7603616,"['0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Heterocyclic Compounds, 3-Ring)', '0 (Imidazoles)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (PS1145)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Pyridines)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-6)', '0 (Transcription Factor AP-1)', '0 (interleukin-6 receptor alpha)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'OU13V1EYWQ (SB 203580)']",IM,"['*Apoptosis/genetics', 'Cell Survival/physiology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Radiation', 'Endothelial Cells/*metabolism', 'Endothelium, Vascular/cytology', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Gene Expression', 'Heterocyclic Compounds, 3-Ring/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Imidazoles/pharmacology', 'Interleukin-6/genetics/*metabolism', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'NF-kappa B/*metabolism', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*metabolism', 'Pyridines/pharmacology', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'RNA, Small Interfering/pharmacology', 'Receptors, Interleukin-6/physiology', 'Signal Transduction/physiology/radiation effects', 'Transcription Factor AP-1/metabolism', 'p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism']",2009/11/26 06:00,2009/12/16 06:00,['2009/11/26 06:00'],"['2008/11/05 00:00 [received]', '2009/07/15 00:00 [revised]', '2009/08/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/11/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/11/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2009/12/16 06:00 [medline]']","['S0360-3016(09)02981-2 [pii]', '10.1016/j.ijrobp.2009.08.034 [doi]']",ppublish,Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 2009 Dec 1;75(5):1553-61. doi: 10.1016/j.ijrobp.2009.08.034.,75,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recent studies with small fragments of the Moloney murine leukemia virus (MoMuLV) genome suggested that selection may be mediated by an RNA switch mechanism, in which conserved UCUG elements that are sequestered by base-pairing in the monomeric RNA become exposed upon dimerization to allow binding to the cognate nucleocapsid (NC) domains of the viral Gag proteins. Here we show that a large fragment of the MoMuLV 5' untranslated region that contains all residues necessary for efficient RNA packaging (Psi(WT); residues 147-623) also exhibits a dimerization-dependent affinity for NC, with the native dimer ([Psi(WT)](2)) binding 12+/-2 NC molecules with high affinity (K(d)=17+/-7 nM) and with the monomer, stabilized by substitution of dimer-promoting loop residues with hairpin-stabilizing sequences (Psi(M)), binding 1-2 NC molecules. Identical dimer-inhibiting mutations in MoMuLV-based vectors significantly inhibit genome packaging in vivo (approximately 100-fold decrease), whereas a large deletion of nearly 200 nucleotides just upstream of the gag start codon has minimal effects. Our findings support the proposed RNA switch mechanism and further suggest that virus assembly may be initiated by a complex comprising as few as 12 Gag molecules bound to a dimeric packaging signal.","['Miyazaki, Yasuyuki', 'Garcia, Eric L', 'King, Steven R', 'Iyalla, Kilali', 'Loeliger, Kelsey', 'Starck, Patrice', 'Syed, Sameera', 'Telesnitsky, Alice', 'Summers, Michael F']","['Miyazaki Y', 'Garcia EL', 'King SR', 'Iyalla K', 'Loeliger K', 'Starck P', 'Syed S', 'Telesnitsky A', 'Summers MF']","['Howard Hughes Medical Institute and Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, University of Maryland Baltimore County, 1000 Hilltop Circle, Baltimore, MD 21250, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20091117,England,J Mol Biol,Journal of molecular biology,2985088R,"['0 (RNA, Viral)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Binding Sites', 'Cell Line', 'Dimerization', '*Diploidy', 'Genome, Viral/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/*genetics/*physiology', 'Mutation/genetics', 'Nucleic Acid Conformation', 'Nucleocapsid/genetics', 'RNA Stability', 'RNA, Viral/*chemistry/*genetics', 'Temperature', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Virus Assembly/*genetics']",2009/11/26 06:00,2010/02/19 06:00,['2009/11/26 06:00'],"['2009/10/09 00:00 [received]', '2009/11/10 00:00 [revised]', '2009/11/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/11/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/11/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/02/19 06:00 [medline]']","['S0022-2836(09)01410-7 [pii]', '10.1016/j.jmb.2009.11.033 [doi]']",ppublish,J Mol Biol. 2010 Feb 12;396(1):141-52. doi: 10.1016/j.jmb.2009.11.033.

The skin is a frequent target organ of cGVHD and often the presenting location of the disease, making dermatologists key in recognition and management. It has been proposed that cutaneous cGVHD is a spectrum of disease and the lesions may evolve through various stages. Lichen sclerosus et atrophicus-like cGVHD may represent a phase in this continuum or a distinct sub-type of disease.

These improved survivals have resulted in the need to address issues relating to quality of life, including fertility and procreation. Treatment may require lifelong daily therapy with drugs that might inhibit proteins essential to gonadal function, implantation, and embryogenesis. Animal data suggest that imatinib at standard dosages is unlikely to impair fertility in either adult male or female animals. However, human data remain limited, particularly in children and adolescents. Children born to men who are actively taking imatinib at conception seem healthy, and current advice is not to discontinue treatment. In contrast, data are less encouraging for children born to women exposed to imatinib during pregnancy. Although numbers are small, a disturbing cluster of rare congenital malformations has prevented imatinib from being recommended safely, particularly during the period of organogenesis. Alternative strategies for managing pregnancy in chronic myelogenous leukemia include one or both of regular leukapheresis and interferon-alpha. Pregnancy in advanced-phase disease presents particular problems.","['Apperley, Jane']",['Apperley J'],"['Imperial College, Hammersmith Campus, London, England W12 0NN. j.apperley@imperial.ac.uk']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,J Natl Compr Canc Netw,Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network : JNCCN,101162515,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Teratogens)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)']",IM,"['Abnormalities, Drug-Induced/epidemiology', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Benzamides', 'Drug-Related Side Effects and Adverse Reactions', 'Female', 'Fertility/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Models, Animal', 'Piperazines/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Complications, Neoplastic/*drug therapy', '*Pregnancy Outcome', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Pyrimidines/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Quality of Life', 'Risk Factors', 'Teratogens/toxicity']",2009/11/26 06:00,2010/03/03 06:00,['2009/11/26 06:00'],"['2009/07/28 00:00 [received]', '2009/09/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/11/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/11/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/03/03 06:00 [medline]']",['10.6004/jnccn.2009.0069 [doi]'],ppublish,J Natl Compr Canc Netw. 2009 Nov;7(10):1050-8. doi: 10.6004/jnccn.2009.0069.,7,,,,,65,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We identified a novel member of this family, growth-differentiation factor 8 (GDF-8) in the 72 h post coital uterine fluid of the golden hamster by proteomic techniques. Uterine GDF-8 mRNA decreased as pregnancy progressed while its active protein peaked at 72 h post coitus (hpc) and thereafter stayed at a lower level. At 72 hpc, the GDF-8 transcript was localized to the endometrial epithelium while its protein accumulated in the stroma. Exogenous GDF-8 slowed down proliferation of primary cultures of uterine smooth muscle cells (SMC) and endometrial epithelial cells (EEC). In addition, GDF-8 attenuated the release of LIF (leukaemia inhibiting factor) by EEC. As for the embryo in culture, GDF-8 promoted proliferation of the trophotoderm (TM) and hatching but discouraged attachment. Our study suggests that GDF-8 could regulate the behavior of preimplantation embryos and fine-tune the physiology of uterine environment during pregnancy.","['Wong, Chun Lung', 'Huang, Ya Yu', 'Ho, Wing Kei', 'Poon, Hong Kit', 'Cheung, Pui Lai', 'O, Wai Sum', 'Chow, Pak Ham']","['Wong CL', 'Huang YY', 'Ho WK', 'Poon HK', 'Cheung PL', 'O WS', 'Chow PH']","['School of Biomedical Sciences, Faculty of Medicine, Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shatin, Hong Kong, PR China. chun_lung_wong@yahoo.com.hk']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20091125,England,Reprod Biol Endocrinol,Reproductive biology and endocrinology : RB&E,101153627,['0 (Myostatin)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Body Fluids/chemistry/metabolism', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Cricetinae', 'Female', 'Male', 'Mesocricetus/*genetics/metabolism/physiology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Myocytes, Smooth Muscle/drug effects/metabolism/physiology', 'Myometrium/cytology/drug effects/metabolism/physiology', 'Myostatin/*genetics/metabolism/pharmacology/*physiology', 'Pregnancy', 'Proteomics', 'Sequence Homology, Nucleic Acid', 'Uterus/*metabolism/physiology']",2009/11/26 06:00,2010/02/16 06:00,['2009/11/26 06:00'],"['2009/08/04 00:00 [received]', '2009/11/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/11/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/11/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/02/16 06:00 [medline]']","['1477-7827-7-134 [pii]', '10.1186/1477-7827-7-134 [doi]']",epublish,Reprod Biol Endocrinol. 2009 Nov 25;7:134. doi: 10.1186/1477-7827-7-134.,7,,,PMC2790456,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

DNA methylation of driver genes is very likely outnumbered by the number of methylated passenger genes, though these can be useful as tumor markers. Much of what is known about the importance of DNA methylation in cancer was gained through small- and moderate-scale analysis of gene promoters and tumor samples. A much better understanding of the role of DNA methylation in cancer, either as a marker of disease or as an active driver of tumorigenesis, will likely be gained from genome-wide studies of this modification in normal and malignant cells. This goal has become more attainable with the recent introduction of large-scale genome analysis methodologies and these have been modified to allow for investigation of DNA methylation. Several research groups have been formed to coordinate efforts and apply these methodologies to decipher the methylome of healthy and diseased tissues. In this article we review technological advances in genome-wide methylation profiling.","['Estecio, Marcos Rh', 'Issa, Jean-Pierre J']","['Estecio MR', 'Issa JP']","['Department of Leukemia, UT MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20091116,England,Genome Med,Genome medicine,101475844,,,,2009/11/26 06:00,2009/11/26 06:01,['2009/11/26 06:00'],"['2009/11/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/11/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2009/11/26 06:01 [medline]']","['gm106 [pii]', '10.1186/gm106 [doi]']",epublish,Genome Med. 2009 Nov 16;1(11):106. doi: 10.1186/gm106.,1,,,PMC2808741,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Their precise identification becomes essential for diagnosis, prognosis, and therapeutic choices. Resulting fusion transcripts (FT) are also powerful markers for monitoring the efficacy of treatment, the minimal residual disease (MRD) and could become therapeutic targets. Today, the challenge is to propose an individual follow-up for each patient even for those with a rare fusion event. In this study, we propose a biochip-based assay integrated in a global strategy for identification of rare FT in AML, after fluorescence in situ hybridization detection, as described by the World Health Organization classification. Using cell lines, we developed and validated a biochip-based assay called the AMLFusionChip that identifies every FT of AML1-ETO, CBFbeta-MYH11 as well as MLL-AF9, MLL-ENL, MLL-AF6, and MLL-AF10. The original design of our AMLFusionChip.v01 enables the identification of these FT wherever the breakpoint on the partner gene may be. In case of biochip negative result, our 3'RACE amplification strategy enables to clone and then sequence the new translocation partner.

A distinct correlation between apparent dissociation constants (K(d)) and apoptotic activity for eight murine anti-CD20 mAbs (OUBM1-OUBM8) and previously-developed murine anti-CD20 mAbs enabled us to categorize anti-CD20 mAbs into two groups. Group A mAbs had lower K(d) values and did not induce definite apoptosis, while Group B mAbs had greater K(d) values and did induce definite apoptosis. A murine version mAb of rituximab, 2B8, belongs to Group B. An epitope analysis showed that the epitope of two murine mAbs, OUBM3 and OUBM6, differed from that of 2B8 or 2F2 (ofatumumab). Two mAbs, OUBM3 from Group A and OUBM6 from Group B, were selected and humanized. As expected, the humanized OUBM3 with the lower K(d) did not induce apoptosis, while the humanized OUBM6 (hOUBM6) with the greater K(d) did. Both hOUBM3 and hOUBM6 induced highly-effective, complement-dependent cytotoxicity and antibody-dependent, cell-mediated cytotoxicity against Burkitt's and follicular lymphomas. Importantly, hOUBM6 exhibited cellular cytotoxicity against diffuse, large B cells that are less effectively depleted by rituximab and also exhibited effective cytotoxicity against tumor cells from human CD20(+) leukemia and lymphoma patients. These results suggest the potential impact of the further development of our anti-CD20 mAbs.

A new test with unknown performance has recently appeared on the market. OBJECTIVES: The aims of this study were to define the efficacy of a new in-clinic test system, the Anigen Rapid FIV Ab/FeLV Ag Test, and to compare it with the current leading in-clinic test, the SNAP Kombi Plus FeLV Antigen/FIB Antibody Test. METHODS: Three-hundred serum samples from randomly selected healthy and diseased cats presented to the Clinic of Small Animal Medicine at Ludwig Maximilian University were tested using both the Anigen Rapid Test and the SNAP Kombi Plus Test. Diagnostic sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values were calculated for both tests using Western blot as the gold standard for verification of FIV infection and PCR as the gold standard for FeLV infection. RESULTS: The presence of antibodies against FIV was confirmed by Western blot in 9/300 samples (prevalence 3%). FeLV DNA was detected by PCR in 15/300 samples (prevalence 5%). For FIV infection the Anigen Rapid Test had a sensitivity of 88.9%, specificity of 99.7%, positive predictive value of 88.9%, and negative predictive value of 99.7%. For FeLV infection, the Anigen Rapid Test had a sensitivity of 40.0%, specificity of 100%, positive predictive value of 100%, and negative predictive value of 96.9%. Diagnostic accuracy was similar to that of the SNAP Kombi Plus Test. CONCLUSION: The new Anigen Rapid FIV Ab/FeLV Ag Test performed very well and can be recommended for use in veterinary practice.","['Sand, Christina', 'Englert, Theresa', 'Egberink, Herman', 'Lutz, Hans', 'Hartmann, Katrin']","['Sand C', 'Englert T', 'Egberink H', 'Lutz H', 'Hartmann K']","['Clinic of Small Animal Medicine, College of Veterinary Medicine, Ludwig Maximilian University, 80539 Munich, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20091117,United States,Vet Clin Pathol,Veterinary clinical pathology,9880575,"['0 (Antibodies, Viral)', '0 (Reagent Kits, Diagnostic)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Viral/immunology', 'Blotting, Western/veterinary', 'Cats/virology', 'Feline Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome/*diagnosis/virology', '*Immunodeficiency Virus, Feline', '*Leukemia Virus, Feline', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction/veterinary', 'Reagent Kits, Diagnostic/veterinary', 'Retroviridae Infections/diagnosis/*veterinary/virology', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Tumor Virus Infections/diagnosis/*veterinary/virology']",2009/11/26 06:00,2010/10/26 06:00,['2009/11/26 06:00'],"['2009/11/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/11/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/10/26 06:00 [medline]']","['VCP196 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1939-165X.2009.00196.x [doi]']",ppublish,Vet Clin Pathol. 2010 Jun;39(2):210-4. doi: 10.1111/j.1939-165X.2009.00196.x.

Southern China is located in a region with one of the world's fastest growing HIV/AIDS epidemics. Attitudes towards PLWHA amongst health workers are currently under-researched in this region. This paper examines the inter-relationships between prejudicial attitudes among Chinese medical students towards HIV/AIDS and attitudes towards three risk behaviors: injecting drug use (IDU), commercial sex (CS) and commercial blood donation (CBD). Medical students (N = 352) in Guangzhou were presented with two random vignettes; each describing a hypothetical male that was identical, except for the disease diagnosis (AIDS/leukemia) and the co-characteristic (IDU/CS/CBD/blood transfusion/no co-characteristic). After reading each vignette, participants completed a standard prejudicial scale. Univariate and multivariable analyses revealed significant levels of prejudice associated with AIDS, IDU and CS. Regardless of the disease, patients with IDU or CS were judged significantly worse than patients who had received a blood transfusion. No significant interactions were found between AIDS and the stigmatized co-characteristics. The findings suggest that prejudice towards PLWHA needs to be understood within the larger context of the stigma towards risk behaviors. Although non-significant interactions were found between AIDS and the stigmatized risk behaviors, the overlap between the local HIV/AIDS, IDU and CS populations suggests that addressing risk behavior-related prejudices could be critical for improving care and treatment for PLWHA.","['Chan, Kit Yee', 'Yang, Yi', 'Li, Ze-rong', 'Stoove, Mark A', 'Reidpath, Daniel D']","['Chan KY', 'Yang Y', 'Li ZR', 'Stoove MA', 'Reidpath DD']","['Nossal Institute for Global Health, University of Melbourne, Victoria, Australia. k.chan@unimelb.edu.au']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Netherlands,Curr HIV Res,Current HIV research,101156990,,IM,"['Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome/etiology/*psychology', 'Adolescent', 'Attitude of Health Personnel', 'Blood Donors/psychology', 'China', 'Data Collection', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', '*Prejudice', '*Risk-Taking', 'Sex Work/psychology', 'Stereotyping', 'Students, Medical/*psychology', 'Substance Abuse, Intravenous/complications/psychology', 'Young Adult']",2009/11/26 06:00,2010/02/24 06:00,['2009/11/26 06:00'],"['2009/11/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/11/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/02/24 06:00 [medline]']",['10.2174/157016209789973655 [doi]'],ppublish,Curr HIV Res. 2009 Nov;7(6):601-11. doi: 10.2174/157016209789973655.,7,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

While it is possible to produce such altered signal transduction by synthetic means, the development of chemically defined multivalent ligands of effectors is sometimes difficult and tedious. Specifically, the average spacing between two binding sites within an antibody and the average distance between receptors on the cell membrane are usually larger than most organic molecules. In this study, we directly address these challenges by demonstrating how gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) of precisely controlled mean diameters can be easily synthesized and surface-modified with dinitrophenyl (DNP) at an equally well-controlled ligand density or spacing. We found that both nanoparticle size and surface ligand density play key regulatory roles in the process of membrane antibody-receptor (IgE-Fc epsilonRI) binding and cross-linking, which, in turn, leads to degranulation and consequent release of chemical mediators on rat basophilic leukemia cells. In addition, by adjusting DNP-AuNP architecture, we discovered that our conjugates could either promote or inhibit cellular activation. Thus, these results demonstrate that nanoparticles serve not only as simple platforms for multivalent binding but also as mediators for key biological functions. As such, the findings we report here may provide insight into the use of nanoparticles as a comprehensive tool for use in detailed receptor/ligand interaction studies and in the design of nanoscale delivery and therapeutic systems.","['Huang, Yu-Fen', 'Liu, Haipeng', 'Xiong, Xiangling', 'Chen, Yan', 'Tan, Weihong']","['Huang YF', 'Liu H', 'Xiong X', 'Chen Y', 'Tan W']","['Center for Research at Bio/nano Interface, Department of Chemistry, University of Florida, Gainesville, Florida 32611-7200, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,J Am Chem Soc,Journal of the American Chemical Society,7503056,"['0 (Receptors, IgE)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Mast Cells/*metabolism', '*Nanoparticles', 'Rats', 'Receptors, IgE/*metabolism']",2009/11/26 06:00,2010/01/22 06:00,['2009/11/26 06:00'],"['2009/11/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/11/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/01/22 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1021/ja907125t [doi]'],ppublish,J Am Chem Soc. 2009 Dec 2;131(47):17328-34. doi: 10.1021/ja907125t.,131,"['R01 GM079359/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 GM079359-01/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 GM079359-03/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 GM079359-01S1/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 GM079359-02/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']",,PMC2786779,['NIHMS158340'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In contrast to no significant changes in phospho-JNK and phospho-ERK levels, AA evoked notable activation of p38 MAPK. Unlike that of JNK and p38 MAPK, ERK suppression further reduced the viability of AA-treated cells. Increases in Fas/FasL protein expression, caspase-8 activation, the production of tBid and the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential were noted with K562 cells that were treated with a combination of U0126 and AA. Down-regulation of FADD attenuated U0126-evoked degradation of procaspase-8 and Bid. Abolition of p38 MAPK activation abrogated U0126-elicited Fas/FasL up-regulation in AA-treated cells. U0126 pretreatment suppressed c-Fos phosphorylation but increased p38 MAPK-mediated c-Jun phosphorylation. Knock-down of c-Fos and c-Jun protein expression by siRNA suggested that c-Fos counteracted the effect of c-Jun on Fas/FasL up-regulation. Taken together, our data indicate that AA induces the ROS/mitochondria-dependent death pathway and blocks the ERK pathway which enhances the cytotoxicity of AA through additionally evoking an autocrine Fas-mediated apoptotic mechanism in K562 cells.","['Chen, Ku-Chung', 'Liu, Wen-Hsin', 'Chang, Long-Sen']","['Chen KC', 'Liu WH', 'Chang LS']","['Institute of Biomedical Sciences, Kaohsiung Medical University Joint Research Center, National Sun Yat-Sen University, Kaohsiung 804, Taiwan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,J Cell Physiol,Journal of cellular physiology,0050222,"['0 (Antioxidants)', '0 (BH3 Interacting Domain Death Agonist Protein)', '0 (BID protein, human)', '0 (FASLG protein, human)', '0 (Fas Ligand Protein)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-fos)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-jun)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '0 (fas Receptor)', '27YG812J1I (Arachidonic Acid)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP8 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 8)']",IM,"['Antioxidants/pharmacology', '*Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Arachidonic Acid/*metabolism', '*Autocrine Communication/drug effects', 'BH3 Interacting Domain Death Agonist Protein/metabolism', 'Caspase 8/metabolism', 'Cell Survival', 'Down-Regulation', 'Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Fas Ligand Protein/metabolism', 'Humans', 'JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/metabolism', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*enzymology/immunology/pathology', 'Membrane Potential, Mitochondrial', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-fos/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-jun/metabolism', 'RNA Interference', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism', '*Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Time Factors', 'Transfection', 'fas Receptor/*metabolism', 'p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/metabolism']",2009/11/21 06:00,2010/01/20 06:00,['2009/11/21 06:00'],"['2009/11/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/11/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/01/20 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/jcp.21979 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cell Physiol. 2010 Mar;222(3):625-34. doi: 10.1002/jcp.21979.,222,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In recent years, the full coding component of the human genome was sequenced in various cancers, whereas such attempts related to ncRNAs are still fragmentary. We screened genomic DNAs for sequence variations in 148 microRNAs (miRNAs) and ultraconserved regions (UCRs) loci in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) or colorectal cancer (CRC) by Sanger technique and further tried to elucidate the functional consequences of some of these variations. We found sequence variations in miRNAs in both sporadic and familial CLL cases, mutations of UCRs in CLLs and CRCs and, in certain instances, detected functional effects of these variations. Furthermore, by integrating our data with previously published data on miRNA sequence variations, we have created a catalog of DNA sequence variations in miRNAs/ultraconserved genes in human cancers. These findings argue that ncRNAs are targeted by both germ line and somatic mutations as well as by single-nucleotide polymorphisms with functional significance for human tumorigenesis. Sequence variations in ncRNA loci are frequent and some have functional and biological significance. Such information can be exploited to further investigate on a genome-wide scale the frequency of genetic variations in ncRNAs and their functional meaning, as well as for the development of new diagnostic and prognostic markers for leukemias and carcinomas.","['Wojcik, Sylwia E', 'Rossi, Simona', 'Shimizu, Masayoshi', 'Nicoloso, Milena S', 'Cimmino, Amelia', 'Alder, Hansjuerg', 'Herlea, Vlad', 'Rassenti, Laura Z', 'Rai, Kanti R', 'Kipps, Thomas J', 'Keating, Michael J', 'Croce, Carlo M', 'Calin, George A']","['Wojcik SE', 'Rossi S', 'Shimizu M', 'Nicoloso MS', 'Cimmino A', 'Alder H', 'Herlea V', 'Rassenti LZ', 'Rai KR', 'Kipps TJ', 'Keating MJ', 'Croce CM', 'Calin GA']","['Department of Molecular Virology, Immunology and Medical Genetics, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH 43210, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20091119,England,Carcinogenesis,Carcinogenesis,8008055,"['0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (RNA, Untranslated)']",IM,"['Adenocarcinoma/*genetics/pathology', 'Colorectal Neoplasms/*genetics/pathology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', '*Genetic Variation', 'Genome, Human', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*genetics/pathology', 'MicroRNAs/*genetics', 'Mutation', 'RNA, Untranslated/*genetics']",2009/11/21 06:00,2010/03/05 06:00,['2009/11/21 06:00'],"['2009/11/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/11/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/03/05 06:00 [medline]']","['bgp209 [pii]', '10.1093/carcin/bgp209 [doi]']",ppublish,Carcinogenesis. 2010 Feb;31(2):208-15. doi: 10.1093/carcin/bgp209.

Using expression profiling studies, we found that the levels of 2 core components of the circadian network, Per2 and Rev-Erb alpha, are significantly altered by C/EBPs. Further studies showed that levels of Per2 were reduced in lymphoma and acute myeloid leukemia patient samples, as well as in lymphoma cell lines. Overexpression of Per2 in hematopoietic cancer cell lines resulted in growth inhibition, cell cycle arrest, apoptosis and loss of clonogenic ability. These results support the emerging role of circadian genes in tumor suppression.","['Gery, Sigal', 'Koeffler, H Phillip']","['Gery S', 'Koeffler HP']","['Division of Hematology/Oncology, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, UCLA School of Medicine, Los Angeles, CA 90048, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20091118,United States,Integr Cancer Ther,Integrative cancer therapies,101128834,"['0 (CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Proteins)', '0 (NR1D1 protein, human)', '0 (Nr1d1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Nuclear Receptor Subfamily 1, Group D, Member 1)', '0 (PER2 protein, human)', '0 (Per2 protein, mouse)', '0 (Period Circadian Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis', 'CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Cell Cycle/genetics', 'Cell Differentiation/genetics', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Circadian Rhythm', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Mice', 'Nuclear Receptor Subfamily 1, Group D, Member 1/genetics/*metabolism', 'Period Circadian Proteins/genetics/*metabolism']",2009/11/21 06:00,2010/03/23 06:00,['2009/11/21 06:00'],"['2009/11/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/11/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/03/23 06:00 [medline]']","['1534735409352084 [pii]', '10.1177/1534735409352084 [doi]']",ppublish,Integr Cancer Ther. 2009 Dec;8(4):317-20. doi: 10.1177/1534735409352084.

Thus, the presence of aberrant antigen expression detectable by flow cytometry may be critical for diagnosis of B-ALL and detection of minimal residual disease. The current study examined the immunophenotype of B-lineage leukemic lymphoblasts in 200 consecutive, unique, pretreatment patient specimens. We found that all cases of B-ALL exhibited multiple immunophenotypic aberrancies by which they can be distinguished from hematogones. The most frequent aberrancies were uniform or a spectrum of expression of terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase and CD34, underexpression of CD45, overexpression of CD10, underexpression of CD38, and underexpression of CD20. Asynchronous coexpression of CD34 and CD20 was also frequently observed. Of the 200 cases, 86.5% expressed myeloid-associated antigens, and 19.0% expressed 3 or more. Of 200 cases, 9.0% aberrantly expressed T cell-associated antigens. There were significant differences in antigen-expression patterns between adult and pediatric B-ALL. Specific aberrancies correlate with recurrent cytogenetic abnormalities in B-ALL.","['Seegmiller, Adam C', 'Kroft, Steven H', 'Karandikar, Nitin J', 'McKenna, Robert W']","['Seegmiller AC', 'Kroft SH', 'Karandikar NJ', 'McKenna RW']","['Department of Pathology, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center at Dallas, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,England,Am J Clin Pathol,American journal of clinical pathology,0370470,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/metabolism', 'Bone Marrow Cells/*pathology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping/*methods', 'In Situ Nick-End Labeling', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/immunology/metabolism/*pathology', 'Middle Aged', 'Precursor Cells, B-Lymphoid/immunology/*pathology', 'Young Adult']",2009/11/21 06:00,2009/12/16 06:00,['2009/11/21 06:00'],"['2009/11/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/11/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2009/12/16 06:00 [medline]']","['132/6/940 [pii]', '10.1309/AJCP8G5RMTWUEMUU [doi]']",ppublish,Am J Clin Pathol. 2009 Dec;132(6):940-9. doi: 10.1309/AJCP8G5RMTWUEMUU.,132,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

High-density array comparative genomic hybridization also identified gains in part of chromosome 16q in IDCS. Our study demonstrates for the first time clonal transformation of CLL/SLL into IDCS.

The immunomodulatory ability of bone marrow (BM)-derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) shows promise in treating GVHD, especially given its previous success in treating patients with acute GVHD (aGVHD). The potential efficacy and safety issues for treating cGVHD, particularly ScGVHD, remain to be clarified, however. Here, we report 4 patients with ScGVHD who received MSCs expanded ex vivo from unrelated donors by intra-BM injection. After MSC infusion, the ratio of helper T lymphocyte (Th) 1 cells to Th2 cells was dramatically reversed, with an increase in Th1 and a decrease in Th2 achieving a new balance. Correspondingly, symptoms gradually improved in all 4 patients. During the course of MSC treatment, the patients' vital signs and laboratory results remained normal.

Although this study alone cannot guarantee the application of MSCs in ScGVHD, our findings strongly suggest that this treatment is therapeutically practicable, with no detectable side effects.

Immunoprophylaxis and antiviral therapy have reduced the mortality, but the morbidity remains significant and is explored here in a cohort of children with ALL. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Among 67 children diagnosed with ALL during 1992-2007, 22 were seronegative for varicella-zoster virus (VZV) at the time of diagnosis. Patient records were reviewed to describe varicella exposures, eruptions and vaccinations during chemotherapy (24-30 months) and the following six months of immune recovery. RESULTS: Fifteen exposures were recognised in eight children and were managed with oral acyclovir prophylaxis; three resulted in clinical infection. Adoption of brief prophylaxis in the second week of incubation has not - so far - increased the infection rate (one in six versus two in nine). A further six varicella cases occurred without recognised exposure. All nine eruptions (in eight children) were uncomplicated but entailed hospitalisation days for intravenous therapy with acyclovir and loss of chemotherapy days. Seven children were VZV-vaccinated during maintenance chemotherapy; none developed varicella or zoster later in the course. CONCLUSION: Despite protective isolation and prophylactic treatment, seronegative children with ALL have a high risk of varicella during or shortly after chemotherapy. We recommend that susceptible siblings should be vaccinated at the time of diagnosis and the child should receive vaccination once oral maintenance chemotherapy has been initiated.","['Sorensen, Gitte Vrelits', 'Helgestad, Jon', 'Rosthoj, Steen']","['Sorensen GV', 'Helgestad J', 'Rosthoj S']","['Arhus Universitetshospital, Aalborg Sygehus, Arhus C, Denmark. gittevs@hotmail.com']",['dan'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",,Denmark,Ugeskr Laeger,Ugeskrift for laeger,0141730,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Antiviral Agents)', '0 (Chickenpox Vaccine)', 'X4HES1O11F (Acyclovir)']",IM,"['Acyclovir/administration & dosage', 'Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*adverse effects', 'Antiviral Agents/administration & dosage', 'Chickenpox/*etiology/immunology/prevention & control', 'Chickenpox Vaccine/administration & dosage', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cohort Studies', 'Humans', 'Immunocompromised Host', 'Infant', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/immunology', 'Risk Factors']",2009/11/21 06:00,2009/12/16 06:00,['2009/11/21 06:00'],"['2009/11/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/11/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2009/12/16 06:00 [medline]']",['VP12080589 [pii]'],ppublish,Ugeskr Laeger. 2009 Nov 9;171(46):3354-9.,171,,,,,,,,,,,,,Varicel-associeret morbiditet hos born i kemoterapi for akut lymfoblastaer leukaemi.,,,,,,,

We aimed to assess morbidity from herpes zoster in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). MATERIAL AND METHODS: Reviewing records, treatment and course of zoster eruptions were registered in a cohort of 67 children with newly diagnosed ALL. Of these, 45 had had varicella at the time of diagnosis and 15 contracted varicella or were vaccinated during the course of therapy. RESULTS: Eleven children had a total of 17 eruptions while receiving chemotherapy. All eruptions were treated with acyclovir, in eight cases intravenously, and in six cases chemotherapy was interrupted. Cutaneous dissemination occurred in two cases, visceral dissemination in none. One child had postherpetic trigeminal neuralgia for two months. The eruption rate was higher among small children than among school-aged children (0.22 vs. 0.13 per year of chemotherapy) and was related to the intensity of chemotherapy (0.30 per year of consolidation treatment vs. 0.13 for maintenance therapy). Three children on prolonged intensive chemotherapy had recurrent zoster episodes. CONCLUSION: Chemotherapy causes zoster eruptions in approximately one quarter of children with ALL, and with intensive protocols recurrent zoster can cause significant morbidity.

In addition, cats with negative FeLV antigen-test results that have cytopenias of unknown etiology often are suspected to suffer from latent FeLV infection that is responsible for the nonregenerative cytopenias. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to assess the role of latent FeLV infection by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in bone marrow of cats with nonregenerative cytopenias that had negative FeLV antigen test results in blood. ANIMALS: Thirty-seven cats were included in the patient group. Inclusion criteria were (1) nonregenerative cytopenia of unknown origin and (2) negative FeLV antigen test result. Antigenemia was determined by detection of free FeLV p27 antigen by ELISA in serum. Furthermore, 7 cats with positive antigen test results with nonregenerative cytopenia were included as control group I, and 30 cats with negative antigen test results without nonregenerative cytopenia were included as control group II. METHODS: Whole blood and bone marrow samples were tested by 2 different PCR assays detecting sequences of the envelope or long terminal repeat genes. FeLV immunohistochemistry was performed in bone marrow samples. RESULTS: Two of the 37 cats (5.4%) in the patient group were positive on the bone marrow PCR results and thus were latently infected with FeLV. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: The findings of this study suggest that FeLV latency is rare in cats with nonregenerative cytopenias.","['Stutzer, B', 'Muller, F', 'Majzoub, M', 'Lutz, H', 'Greene, C E', 'Hermanns, W', 'Hartmann, K']","['Stutzer B', 'Muller F', 'Majzoub M', 'Lutz H', 'Greene CE', 'Hermanns W', 'Hartmann K']","['Clinic of Small Animal Medicine, LMU University of Munich, Munich, Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,J Vet Intern Med,Journal of veterinary internal medicine,8708660,,IM,"['Animals', 'Cat Diseases/*etiology', 'Cats', 'Female', 'Hematologic Diseases/complications/*veterinary/virology', 'Immunohistochemistry/veterinary', '*Leukemia Virus, Feline', 'Male', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction/veterinary', 'Retroviridae Infections/complications/*veterinary', 'Tumor Virus Infections/complications/*veterinary', 'Virus Latency']",2009/11/21 06:00,2010/07/09 06:00,['2009/11/21 06:00'],"['2009/11/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/11/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/07/09 06:00 [medline]']","['JVIM417 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1939-1676.2009.0417.x [doi]']",ppublish,J Vet Intern Med. 2010 Jan-Feb;24(1):192-7. doi: 10.1111/j.1939-1676.2009.0417.x.,24,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, there is some concern that corticosteroids may suppress the graft-versus-leukemia effect and increase leukemia relapse. To evaluate the effect of corticosteroids on relapse, we analyzed 112 adult patients who received their first allogeneic HSCT for acute myeloid leukemia at our institution between 1997 and 2007. Fifty-seven patients (50.9%) received corticosteroid therapy. Patients who had corticosteroid therapy included higher proportion of patients who developed GVHD. In multivariate analysis, with corticosteroid administration entered as a time-dependent covariate, corticosteroid administration was not a risk factor for relapse (p = 1.00, hazard ratio [HR] 1.00, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.53-1.88), but it was associated with higher non-relapse mortality (NRM) (p < 0.001, HR 55.5, 95% CI 7.42-416) and lower overall survival (p < 0.001, HR 2.68, 95% CI 1.56-4.61). The higher NRM associated with corticosteroid administration was mainly due to the increased deaths caused by the complications themselves, which required corticosteroid therapy. The findings of this study indicate the importance of controlling complications after allogeneic HSCT. The strategy of refraining from indispensable corticosteroid therapy because of the excessive concerns about relapse should be avoided.","['Imahashi, Nobuhiko', 'Inamoto, Yoshihiro', 'Seto, Aika', 'Watanabe, Keisuke', 'Nishiwaki, Satoshi', 'Yanagisawa, Mayumi', 'Shinba, Makoto', 'Yasuda, Takahiko', 'Kuwatsuka, Yachiyo', 'Atsuta, Yoshiko', 'Kodera, Yoshihisa', 'Miyamura, Koichi']","['Imahashi N', 'Inamoto Y', 'Seto A', 'Watanabe K', 'Nishiwaki S', 'Yanagisawa M', 'Shinba M', 'Yasuda T', 'Kuwatsuka Y', 'Atsuta Y', 'Kodera Y', 'Miyamura K']","['Department of Hematology, Japanese Red Cross Nagoya First Hospital, Nagoya University, School of Medicine, Nagoya, Japan. nobuimaima@hotmail.com']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Denmark,Clin Transplant,Clinical transplantation,8710240,['0 (Glucocorticoids)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Female', 'Glucocorticoids/*therapeutic use', 'Graft vs Host Disease/*prevention & control', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*surgery', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Neoplasm Recurrence, Local', 'Prognosis', 'Recurrence', 'Risk Factors', 'Survival Rate', 'Transplantation, Autologous', 'Young Adult']",2009/11/21 06:00,2011/04/01 06:00,['2009/11/21 06:00'],"['2009/11/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/11/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/04/01 06:00 [medline]']","['CTR1158 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1399-0012.2009.01158.x [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Transplant. 2010 Nov-Dec;24(6):772-7. doi: 10.1111/j.1399-0012.2009.01158.x.,24,,,,,,,['(c) 2009 John Wiley & Sons A/S.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

As both vincristine (VCR) and imatinib mesylate (IM) can inhibit MSCs' proliferation, we hypothesized that these drugs might reduce the niche support of MSCs to ALL cells. As a consequence, they can help to re-establish the cytotoxic potential of L-asparaginase on ALL cells even under MSCs support. In our study, pre-treating human MSCs with VCR but not IM, markedly reduced the protective capacity of MSCs. Furthermore, differential rescue effects were observed during addition of exogenous L-asparagine to co-culture with or without VCR pre-treatment. This supported the postulation that VCR could suppress the protective effect of MSCs to ALL cells by suppressing L-asparagine secretion. Our results suggested that the combined VCR and L-asparaginase treatment in ALL were synergistic and VCR can serve as an effective agent in suppressing the leukemic marrow microenvironment.","['Fung, Kwong-Lam', 'Liang, Raymond Hin-Suen', 'Chan, Godfrey Chi-Fung']","['Fung KL', 'Liang RH', 'Chan GC']","['Department of Paediatrics & Adolescent Medicine, Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine, The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong SAR, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Tetrazolium Salts)', '117038-70-7', '(2,3-bis(2-methoxy-4-nitro-5-sulfophenyl)-5-((phenylamino)carbonyl)-2H-tetrazoliu', 'm hydroxide)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 3.5.1.1 (Asparaginase)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Asparaginase/metabolism', 'Benzamides', 'Bone Marrow Cells/cytology', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Inhibitory Concentration 50', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*drug therapy/*pathology', 'Mesenchymal Stem Cells/cytology', 'Mesoderm/*metabolism', 'Models, Biological', 'Piperazines/*pharmacology', 'Pyrimidines/*pharmacology', 'Stromal Cells/metabolism', 'Tetrazolium Salts/pharmacology', 'Vincristine/*pharmacology']",2009/11/21 06:00,2010/11/09 06:00,['2009/11/21 06:00'],"['2009/11/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/11/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/11/09 06:00 [medline]']","['10.3109/10428190903406798 [pii]', '10.3109/10428190903406798 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2010 Mar;51(3):515-22. doi: 10.3109/10428190903406798.,51,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Notably, nuclear factor-kappaB (NFkappaB) is a family of transcription factors involved in immune and inflammatory responses, developmental processes, cellular growth and apoptosis and is deregulated in a number of disease states. We have established a chemiluminescent oligonucleotide-based enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (co-ELISA) that is simple and quantitative. In contrast to currently used assays, it allows quantitation of all NFkappaB components (i.e., RelA, p50, p52, RelB and c-Rel). In addition, it can make use of whole extract and does not require cumbersome nuclear/cytosolic fractionation, saving time and resources. Co-ELISA has a 3.5- to 43-fold higher signal-over-noise ratio than currently available assays, whereas the percent relative standard deviation is 3- to 6-fold lower. Furthermore, the novel method is faster than electrophoretic mobility shift assay, not restricted to transfectable cells as is the case for luciferase reporter assays and 10 times more cost efficient than commercially available ELISA assays. Co-ELISA is a sensitive, fast and cost-efficient quantitation method for all DNA-binding NFkappaB proteins that can be used in high-throughput experimentation.","['Bhattacharya, Nupur', 'Sarno, Antonio', 'Idler, Irina S', 'Fuhrer, Marita', 'Zenz, Thorsten', 'Dohner, Hartmut', 'Stilgenbauer, Stephan', 'Mertens, Daniel']","['Bhattacharya N', 'Sarno A', 'Idler IS', 'Fuhrer M', 'Zenz T', 'Dohner H', 'Stilgenbauer S', 'Mertens D']","['Department of Internal Medicine III, University Hospital Ulm, Ulm, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Boronic Acids)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Oligonucleotides)', '0 (Pyrazines)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '147205-72-9 (CD40 Ligand)', '69G8BD63PP (Bortezomib)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Boronic Acids/pharmacology', 'Bortezomib', 'CD40 Ligand/pharmacology', 'Cell Nucleus/drug effects/genetics/metabolism', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/drug therapy/*metabolism', 'Luminescent Measurements', 'Lymphocytes/drug effects/metabolism', 'NF-kappa B/*metabolism', 'Oligonucleotides/metabolism', 'Pyrazines/pharmacology', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/pharmacology']",2009/11/20 06:00,2010/06/23 06:00,['2009/11/20 06:00'],"['2009/11/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/11/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/06/23 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/ijc.25054 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Cancer. 2010 Jul 15;127(2):404-11. doi: 10.1002/ijc.25054.,127,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We determined the expression of IL-15 in lymphoblasts and evaluated its potential impact on the outcome in adult acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). METHODS: Between June 1999 and June 2006, ALL samples were collected from 87 adult patients before initiation of antineoplastic therapy. These patients were enrolled in the German Multicenter Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia June 1999 and July 2003 study trials. The expression of IL-15 in leukemic cells was analyzed by real-time polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: The expression of IL-15 correlated with the immunophenotype: T-lineage ALL had a more than 4-fold higher IL-15 mRNA expression as compared with B-cell precursor (BCP)-ALL (P < .001). Patients with BCR-ABL(+)-BCP-ALL had lower IL-15 expression compared with BCR-ABL(-)-BCP-ALL (P = .041). Furthermore, higher expression of IL-15 was associated with mediastinal (P = .001) and lymph node infiltration (P = .051), but not with hepatomegaly and splenomegaly. Notably, high IL-15 expression in BCP-ALL was associated with an inferior relapse-free survival (RFS) at 5 years (0.17 +/- 0.13 vs 0.47 +/- 0.13) (P = .008), but there was no impact on overall survival (P = .249). CONCLUSIONS: Differential expression of IL-15 in adult ALL at diagnosis was associated with clinical features and outcome, in particular, RFS. It remains to be evaluated whether IL-15 might be a relevant therapy target, or might be used for risk stratification.","['Wu, Shuling', 'Fischer, Lars', 'Gokbuget, Nicola', 'Schwartz, Stefan', 'Burmeister, Thomas', 'Notter, Michael', 'Hoelzer, Dieter', 'Fuchs, Hendrik', 'Blau, Igor Wolfgang', 'Hofmann, Wolf K', 'Thiel, Eckhard']","['Wu S', 'Fischer L', 'Gokbuget N', 'Schwartz S', 'Burmeister T', 'Notter M', 'Hoelzer D', 'Fuchs H', 'Blau IW', 'Hofmann WK', 'Thiel E']","['Department of Hematology, Oncology and Transfusion Medicine, Campus Benjamin Franklin, Charity Medical Center, Hindenburgdamm 30, 12203 Berlin, Germany. shuling.wu@charite.de']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,['0 (Interleukin-15)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Gene Expression', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Interleukin-15/*genetics', 'Karyotyping', 'Lymphatic Metastasis', 'Male', 'Mediastinal Neoplasms/secondary', 'Middle Aged', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics/pathology', 'Prognosis', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction']",2009/11/20 06:00,2010/03/10 06:00,['2009/11/20 06:00'],"['2009/11/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/11/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/03/10 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/cncr.24729 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 2010 Jan 15;116(2):387-92. doi: 10.1002/cncr.24729.,116,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In a phase 3 dose optimization trial in patients with CML CP (CA180-034), the occurrence of pleural effusion was significantly minimized with dasatinib 100 mg once daily (QD) compared with other treatment arms (70 mg twice daily [twice daily], 140 mg QD, or 50 mg twice daily). METHODS: To investigate the occurrence and management of pleural effusion during dasatinib treatment, and efficacy in patients with or without pleural effusion, data from CA180-034 were analyzed. RESULTS: With 24-month minimum follow-up, 14% of patients treated with dasatinib 100 mg QD incurred pleural effusion (grade 3: 2%; grade 4: 0%) compared with 23% to 26% in other study arms. The pleural effusion rate showed only a minimal increment from 12 to 24 months. In the 100 mg QD study arm, median time to pleural effusion (any grade) was 315 days, and after pleural effusion, 52% of patients had a transient dose interruption, 35% had a dose reduction, 57% received a diuretic, and 26% received a corticosteroid. Three patients in the 100 mg QD study arm discontinued treatment after pleural effusion. Across all study arms, patients with or without pleural effusion demonstrated similar progression-free and overall survival, and cytogenetic response rates were higher in patients with a pleural effusion. CONCLUSIONS: Pleural effusion is minimized with dasatinib 100 mg QD dosing and its occurrence does not affect short- or long-term efficacy.","['Porkka, Kimmo', 'Khoury, H Jean', 'Paquette, Ronald L', 'Matloub, Yousif', 'Sinha, Ritwik', 'Cortes, Jorge E']","['Porkka K', 'Khoury HJ', 'Paquette RL', 'Matloub Y', 'Sinha R', 'Cortes JE']","['Hematology Research Unit, Biomedicum Helsinki, Helsinki University Central Hospital, P.O.

Previous findings have suggested that the mtDNA could play an important role in CLL. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: The mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) control-region was analyzed in lymphocyte cell DNA extracts and compared with their granulocyte counterpart extract of 146 patients suffering from B-Cell CLL; B-CLL (all recruited from the Basque country). Major efforts were undertaken to rule out methodological artefacts that would render a high false positive rate for mtDNA instabilities and thus lead to erroneous interpretation of sequence instabilities. Only twenty instabilities were finally confirmed, most of them affecting the homopolymeric stretch located in the second hypervariable segment (HVS-II) around position 310, which is well known to constitute an extreme mutational hotspot of length polymorphism, as these mutations are frequently observed in the general human population. A critical revision of the findings in previous studies indicates a lack of proper methodological standards, which eventually led to an overinterpretation of the role of the mtDNA in CLL tumorigenesis. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Our results suggest that mtDNA instability is not the primary causal factor in B-CLL. A secondary role of mtDNA mutations cannot be fully ruled out under the hypothesis that the progressive accumulation of mtDNA instabilities could finally contribute to the tumoral process. Recommendations are given that would help to minimize erroneous interpretation of sequencing results in mtDNA studies in tumorigenesis.","['Cerezo, Maria', 'Bandelt, Hans-Jurgen', 'Martin-Guerrero, Idoia', 'Ardanaz, Maite', 'Vega, Ana', 'Carracedo, Angel', 'Garcia-Orad, Africa', 'Salas, Antonio']","['Cerezo M', 'Bandelt HJ', 'Martin-Guerrero I', 'Ardanaz M', 'Vega A', 'Carracedo A', 'Garcia-Orad A', 'Salas A']","['Unidade de Xenetica, Instituto de Medicina Legal, and Departamento de Anatomia Patoloxica y Ciencias Forenses, Facultade de Medicina, Universidade de Santiago de Compostela, Santiago de Compostela, Galicia, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20091118,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (DNA, Mitochondrial)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'DNA Primers/genetics', 'DNA, Mitochondrial/*genetics', 'Databases, Genetic', 'Granulocytes/cytology', 'Haplotypes', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Lymphocytes/cytology', 'Models, Statistical', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutation', 'Phylogeny', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA']",2009/11/20 06:00,2010/04/27 06:00,['2009/11/20 06:00'],"['2009/07/31 00:00 [received]', '2009/10/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/11/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/11/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/04/27 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1371/journal.pone.0007902 [doi]'],epublish,PLoS One. 2009 Nov 18;4(11):e7902. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0007902.,4,,,PMC2775629,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Activation of Tregs by TCR engagement results in upregulation of Foxp3 expression, followed by its rapid nuclear transport and binding to chromatin. Here, we identify three distinct Foxp3 domains that contribute to nuclear transport. The first domain (Domain 1) comprises the C-terminal 12 amino acids. The second domain (Domain 2) is located immediately N-terminal to the forkhead domain (FHD), recently reported to be a binding site for the runt-related transcription factor 1/acute myeloid leukemia 1 (Runx1/AML1). The third domain (Domain 3) is located within the N-terminal first 51 amino acids. Unlike the known nuclear localization signals (NLSs), none of these three regions are rich in basic residues and do not bear any similarity to known monopartite or bipartite NLSs that have one or more clusters of basic amino acids. The basic arginine-lysine-lysine-arginine (RKKR) sequence, located 12-aa from the C-terminal end of Foxp3 was previously reported to be a nuclear localization signal (NLS) for several proteins, including for a GFP-Foxp3 hybrid. Evidence is provided here that in the full-length native Foxp3 RKKR does not function as an NLS. The data reported in this study indicates that Foxp3 achieves nuclear transport by binding to other nuclear factors and co-transporting with them to the nucleus.","['Hancock, Wayne W', 'Ozkaynak, Engin']","['Hancock WW', 'Ozkaynak E']","[""Division of Transplant Immunology, Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia and the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20091118,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (Amino Acids)', '0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (Forkhead Transcription Factors)', '0 (Foxp3 protein, mouse)', '0 (Runx1 protein, mouse)', '147336-22-9 (Green Fluorescent Proteins)']",IM,"['*Active Transport, Cell Nucleus', 'Amino Acids/chemistry', 'Animals', 'Binding Sites', 'Cell Nucleus/metabolism', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit', 'Cytoplasm/metabolism', 'DNA, Complementary/metabolism', 'Female', 'Forkhead Transcription Factors/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Green Fluorescent Proteins/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary']",2009/11/20 06:00,2010/04/27 06:00,['2009/11/20 06:00'],"['2009/07/17 00:00 [received]', '2009/10/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/11/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/11/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/04/27 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1371/journal.pone.0007890 [doi]'],epublish,PLoS One. 2009 Nov 18;4(11):e7890. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0007890.,4,"['R21 AI072420/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', '1R21AI72420-01A1/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States']",,PMC2774276,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The effect of acadesine (AICAR, 5-Aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide-1-beta-D-ribofuranoside) a compound with known antileukemic effect on B cell chronic lymphoblastic leukemia (B-CLL) was investigated in different CML cell lines. Acadesine triggered loss of cell metabolism in K562, LAMA-84 and JURL-MK1 and was also effective in killing imatinib-resistant K562 cells and Ba/F3 cells carrying the T315I-BCR-ABL mutation. The anti-leukemic effect of acadesine did not involve apoptosis but required rather induction of autophagic cell death. AMPK knock-down by Sh-RNA failed to prevent the effect of acadesine, indicating an AMPK-independent mechanism. The effect of acadesine was abrogated by GF109203X and Ro-32-0432, both inhibitor of classical and new PKCs and accordingly, acadesine triggered relocation and activation of several PKC isoforms in K562 cells. In addition, this compound exhibited a potent anti-leukemic effect in clonogenic assays of CML cells in methyl cellulose and in a xenograft model of K562 cells in nude mice.

Therefore, in addition to its promising effects in B-CLL, acadesine might also be beneficial for Imatinib-resistant CML patients.","['Robert, Guillaume', 'Ben Sahra, Issam', 'Puissant, Alexandre', 'Colosetti, Pascal', 'Belhacene, Nathalie', 'Gounon, Pierre', 'Hofman, Paul', 'Bost, Frederic', 'Cassuto, Jill-Patrice', 'Auberger, Patrick']","['Robert G', 'Ben Sahra I', 'Puissant A', 'Colosetti P', 'Belhacene N', 'Gounon P', 'Hofman P', 'Bost F', 'Cassuto JP', 'Auberger P']","['INSERM UMR 895, Team 2: Cell Death Differentiation and Cancer, Nice, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20091118,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (Ribonucleosides)', '360-97-4 (Aminoimidazole Carboxamide)', '53IEF47846 (acadesine)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'EC 2.7.11.31 (AMP-Activated Protein Kinases)']",IM,"['AMP-Activated Protein Kinases/metabolism', 'Aminoimidazole Carboxamide/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Apoptosis', '*Autophagy', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy', 'Mice', 'Mice, Nude', 'Protein Kinase C/metabolism', 'RNA, Small Interfering/metabolism', 'Ribonucleosides/*pharmacology', 'Translocation, Genetic']",2009/11/20 06:00,2010/04/27 06:00,['2009/11/20 06:00'],"['2009/06/18 00:00 [received]', '2009/10/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/11/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/11/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/04/27 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1371/journal.pone.0007889 [doi]'],epublish,PLoS One. 2009 Nov 18;4(11):e7889. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0007889.,4,,,PMC2775681,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The constitutive activation of NF-kappaB in several types of cancers, including hematological malignancies, has been implicated in the resistance to chemo- and radiation therapy. We have previously reported that cytokine- or virus-induced NF-kappaB activation is inhibited by chemical and physical inducers of the heat shock response (HSR). In this study we show that heat stress inhibits constitutive NF-kappaB DNA-binding activity in different types of B-cell malignancies, including multiple myeloma, activated B-cell-like (ABC) type of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and Burkitt's lymphoma presenting aberrant NF-kappaB regulation. Heat-induced NF-kappaB inhibition leads to rapid downregulation of the anti-apoptotic protein cellular inhibitor-of-apoptosis protein 2 (cIAP-2), followed by activation of caspase-3 and cleavage of the caspase-3 substrate poly(adenosine diphosphate ribose)polymerase (PARP), causing massive apoptosis under conditions that do not affect viability in cells not presenting NF-kappaB aberrations. NF-kappaB inhibition by the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib and by short-hairpin RNA (shRNA) interference results in increased sensitivity of HS-Sultan B-cell lymphoma to hyperthermic stress. Altogether, the results indicate that aggressive B-cell malignancies presenting constitutive NF-kappaB activity are sensitive to heat-induced apoptosis, and suggest that aberrant NF-kappaB regulation may be a marker of heat stress sensitivity in cancer cells.","['Belardo, G', 'Piva, R', 'Santoro, M G']","['Belardo G', 'Piva R', 'Santoro MG']","['Department of Biology, University of Rome Tor Vergata, Via della Ricerca Scientifica, Rome 00133, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20091119,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Boronic Acids)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Heat Shock Transcription Factors)', '0 (Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Pyrazines)', '0 (Transcription Factor RelA)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '69G8BD63PP (Bortezomib)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (BIRC3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Baculoviral IAP Repeat-Containing 3 Protein)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases)']",IM,"['*Apoptosis', 'Baculoviral IAP Repeat-Containing 3 Protein', 'Boronic Acids/pharmacology', 'Bortezomib', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'DNA/metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/physiology', 'Heat Shock Transcription Factors', '*Heat-Shock Response', 'Hot Temperature', 'Humans', 'Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/metabolism/*pathology', 'NF-kappa B/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Protein Biosynthesis', 'Pyrazines/pharmacology', 'Signal Transduction/*physiology', 'Transcription Factor RelA/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Transcription Factors/physiology', 'Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases']",2009/11/20 06:00,2010/01/28 06:00,['2009/11/20 06:00'],"['2009/11/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/11/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/01/28 06:00 [medline]']","['leu2009227 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2009.227 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2010 Jan;24(1):187-96. doi: 10.1038/leu.2009.227.

Through inhibition of BCR-ABL, Imatinib blocks several downstream pathways and induces apoptosis of BCR-ABL positive cells. In this study, we analyzed further the mode of action of Imatinib in different appropriate cellular models of CML either sensitive or resistant to Imatinib and in CD34+ cells from CML patients. Pharmacological or short hairpin RNA-mediated inhibition of BCR-ABL triggers lysosomal membrane permeabilization (LMP) that culminates in activation and redistribution of Cathepsin B (CB) into the cytoplasm of CML cells, in which it triggers directly BCR-ABL degradation. Pharmacological inhibition of CB by CA-074Me or small interfering RNA-mediated knock-down of CB partly protects K562 cells from Imatinib-induced cell death and CB overexpression sensitizes these cells to Imatinib killing. Strikingly, Imatinib-triggered LMP, CB activation and BCR-ABL cleavage in CD34+ cells from CML patients and inhibition of CB confers protection against cell death in clonogenic assays of CD34+ primary cells from CML patients. Hence, we describe an original pathway by which Imatinib participates to the elimination of CML cells through LMP and CB-mediated specific degradation of BCR-ABL.","['Puissant, A', 'Colosetti, P', 'Robert, G', 'Cassuto, J-P', 'Raynaud, S', 'Auberger, P']","['Puissant A', 'Colosetti P', 'Robert G', 'Cassuto JP', 'Raynaud S', 'Auberger P']","['INSERM 895, Team 2 Cell Death Differentiation and Cancer, Nice, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20091119,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (abl-bcr fusion protein, human)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'EC 3.4.22.1 (CTSB protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.1 (Cathepsin B)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Benzamides', 'Cathepsin B/*physiology', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Lysosomes/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/drug effects', 'Permeability', 'Piperazines/*pharmacology', 'Pyrimidines/*pharmacology']",2009/11/20 06:00,2010/01/28 06:00,['2009/11/20 06:00'],"['2009/11/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/11/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/01/28 06:00 [medline]']","['leu2009233 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2009.233 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2010 Jan;24(1):115-24. doi: 10.1038/leu.2009.233.

Matching for HLA-A, -B, -C, -DRB1, -DQB1 is beneficial, whereas the importance of DPB1 matching is more controversial. The impact of HLA matching status may differ dependent on disease stage. We investigated the outcome according to the degree of HLA matching at 6 loci, in 488 recipients of predominantly T-cell depleted bone marrow VUD transplants for leukaemia. Survival was significantly better in 12/12-matched transplants in those with early leukaemia (5 years: 63 versus 41% in 10/10 matched, P=0.006), but not late stage disease. Conversely, within the HLA-mismatched group (< or =9/10), there was a significant survival advantage to DPB1 mismatching (5 years: 39 versus 21% in DPB1 matched, P=0.008), particularly in late leukaemia (P=0.01), persisting in multivariate analysis (odds ratio 0.478; 95% confidence interval 0.30, 0.75; P=0.001). These novel findings suggest that the best outcome for patients with early leukaemia, with a 10/10-matched donor, is achieved by matching for DPB1. Conversely, our results suggest that in patients receiving an HLA-mismatched graft, the outcome is significantly better if they are also mismatched for DPB1.

Solubility-limited absorption at higher doses was observed, but this was partially overcome by dividing the daily dose into two. For instance, the administration of 400 mg nilotinib twice daily resulted in a 35% increase in AUC as compared to a once-daily dose of 800 mg. Exploratory pharmacodynamic assessment showed a general trend of greater reduction in white blood cell (WBC) levels with increase in nilotinib concentrations. This finding was consistent with the observation of an 82% reduction in WBC levels in patients after a regimen of 400 mg nilotinib twice daily for 15 days. The type and quantity of food intake variably affected nilotinib absorption.

Methotrexate is a key drug in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) treatment; it inhibits DNA replication by blocking the conversion of 5,10 methylene tetrahydrofolate to 5-methylene tetrahydrofolate by methylene tetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR). MTHFR is central to folate metabolism and has two common functional polymorphisms (C677>T and A1298>C). The present study aimed to assess the prevalence of MTHFR polymorphisms C677>T and A1298>C in Egyptian children with ALL and the relation to the frequency of drug-induced complications and relapse rate. Forty ALL patients were included in the study. They were treated according to modified ALL-BFM 90 protocol, and were followed up for 3.1-6.5 years. The severity and duration of hepatic, mucosal and infectious complications during therapy were reported. MTHFR genotyping was done with a PCR-based restriction fragment length polymorphism assay. The MTHFR C677>T polymorphic allele frequencies were 40, 27.5, and 32.5% for TT, CT, and CC genotypes, respectively among the studied ALL patients. The MTHFR A1298>C polymorphic allele frequencies were 40, 35, and 25% for AA, AC, and CC genotypes, respectively. Methotrexate therapy was significantly associated with increased grade III/IV toxicity in TT genotype: diarrhea in 81.3%, oral mucositis in 81.3%, elevated transaminases in 87.5%, neutropenia in 78.7% compared to values of 7.7, 7.7, 15.3, and 7.7% in CC genotype, respectively (P < 0.0001, P < 0.0001, P < 0.0001, and P = 0.03). The 677 TT genotype was significantly associated with relapse in 5 years in 56.3%, compared to 18.2% in CT and 0% in CC alleles. The overall 5 years survival was significantly lower in 677 TT (50%) compared with CC genotypes (92.3%) (P = 0.001). No significant relation was found between MTHFR A1298C polymorphism and the risks of therapy induced complications or relapse rate in the studied ALL patients. MTHFR TT genotype is significantly associated with increased mucosal and hepatic toxicity during methotrexate therapy as well as increased relapse rate in childhood ALL. Because of the relatively high prevalence of the TT genotype in the studied Egyptian children with ALL, MTHFR gene polymorphisms should be studied in large multicenter studies; and dosage modification of methotrexate in the ALL treatment protocols should be considered based on the MTHFR gene pattern.","['Tantawy, Azza A G', 'El-Bostany, Eman A', 'Adly, Amira A M', 'Abou El Asrar, Mohammed', 'El-Ghouroury, Eman A', 'Abdulghaffar, Esmat E']","['Tantawy AA', 'El-Bostany EA', 'Adly AA', 'Abou El Asrar M', 'El-Ghouroury EA', 'Abdulghaffar EE']","['Pediatric Department, Faculty of Medicine, Ain Shams University, Cairo, Egypt.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,England,Blood Coagul Fibrinolysis,Blood coagulation & fibrinolysis : an international journal in haemostasis and thrombosis,9102551,"['0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'E7WED276I5 (Mercaptopurine)', 'EC 1.5.1.20 (Methylenetetrahydrofolate Reductase (NADPH2))', 'EC 3.5.1.1 (Asparaginase)', 'VB0R961HZT (Prednisone)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)', 'AIEOP acute lymphoblastic leukemia protocol']",IM,"['Alleles', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/administration & dosage/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Asparaginase/administration & dosage', 'Chemical and Drug Induced Liver Injury/etiology/genetics', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cyclophosphamide/administration & dosage', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage', 'Daunorubicin/administration & dosage', 'Egypt/epidemiology', 'Female', 'Gene Frequency', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genotype', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Mercaptopurine/administration & dosage', 'Methotrexate/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Methylenetetrahydrofolate Reductase (NADPH2)/*genetics', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*genetics', 'Polymorphism, Restriction Fragment Length', '*Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/enzymology/*genetics/mortality', 'Prednisone/administration & dosage', 'Recurrence', 'Stomatitis/chemically induced/genetics', 'Vincristine/administration & dosage']",2009/11/20 06:00,2010/03/23 06:00,['2009/11/20 06:00'],"['2009/11/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/11/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/03/23 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1097/MBC.0b013e32833135e9 [doi]'],ppublish,Blood Coagul Fibrinolysis. 2010 Jan;21(1):28-34. doi: 10.1097/MBC.0b013e32833135e9.,21,,,,,,['Blood Coagul Fibrinolysis. 2010 Mar;21(2):200'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Risk models based primarily upon studies of the Japanese A-bomb survivors imply that low-level exposure to ionising radiation, including to ubiquitous natural background radiation, also raises the risk of childhood leukaemia. In a recent paper (Wakeford et al 2009 Leukaemia 23 770-6) we estimated the proportion of childhood leukaemia incidence in Great Britain attributable to natural background radiation to be about 20%. In this paper we employ the two sets of published leukaemia risk models used previously, but use recently published revised estimates of natural background radiation doses received by the red bone marrow of British children to update the previous results. Using the newer dosimetry we calculate that the best estimate of the proportion of cases of childhood leukaemia in Great Britain predicted to be attributable to this source of exposure is 15-20%, although the uncertainty associated with certain stages in the calculation (e.g. the nature of the transfer of risk between populations and the pertinent dose received from naturally occurring alpha-particle-emitting radionuclides) is significant. The slightly lower attributable proportions compared with those previously derived by Wakeford et al (Leukaemia 2009 23 770-6) are largely due to the lower doses (and in particular lower high LET doses) for the first year of life.","['Little, Mark P', 'Wakeford, Richard', 'Kendall, Gerald M']","['Little MP', 'Wakeford R', 'Kendall GM']","['Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, Imperial College, London W2 1PG, UK. mark.little@imperial.ac.uk']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20091118,England,J Radiol Prot,Journal of radiological protection : official journal of the Society for Radiological Protection,8809257,,IM,"['*Background Radiation', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Environmental Exposure/*statistics & numerical data', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Leukemia, Radiation-Induced/*epidemiology', 'Male', '*Proportional Hazards Models', 'Radiation Dosage', 'Radiation Monitoring/*statistics & numerical data', 'Radiation, Ionizing', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'United Kingdom/epidemiology']",2009/11/20 06:00,2010/02/23 06:00,['2009/11/20 06:00'],"['2009/11/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/11/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/02/23 06:00 [medline]']","['S0952-4746(09)22999-5 [pii]', '10.1088/0952-4746/29/4/001 [doi]']",ppublish,J Radiol Prot. 2009 Dec;29(4):467-82. doi: 10.1088/0952-4746/29/4/001.

An MIE-exon 4-deleted rat cytomegalovirus (DeltaIE1) failed to synthesize the IE1 protein and did not disperse promyelocytic leukaemia bodies early post-infection, but was still capable of normal replication in fibroblast cell culture. However, DeltaIE1 had a diminished ability to infect salivary glands persistently in vivo and to reactivate from spleen explant cultures ex vivo. Quantification of viral genomes in spleens of infected animals revealed a reduced amount of DeltaIE1 virus produced during acute infection, suggesting a role for IE1 as a regulator in establishing a chronic or persistent infection, rather than in influencing the latency or reactivation processes more directly.","['Sandford, Gordon R', 'Schumacher, Uwe', 'Ettinger, Jakob', 'Brune, Wolfram', 'Hayward, Gary S', 'Burns, William H', 'Voigt, Sebastian']","['Sandford GR', 'Schumacher U', 'Ettinger J', 'Brune W', 'Hayward GS', 'Burns WH', 'Voigt S']","['The Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20091118,England,J Gen Virol,The Journal of general virology,0077340,"['0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (IE1 protein, cytomegalovirus)', '0 (IE2 protein, Cytomegalovirus)', '0 (Immediate-Early Proteins)', '0 (Trans-Activators)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cells, Cultured', 'DNA, Viral/*genetics', 'Fibroblasts/virology', 'Herpesviridae Infections/virology', 'Immediate-Early Proteins/*genetics', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Muromegalovirus/genetics/*physiology', 'Rats', 'Salivary Glands/virology', '*Sequence Deletion', 'Spleen/virology', 'Trans-Activators/*genetics', 'Virulence', 'Virus Activation', '*Virus Latency', '*Virus Replication']",2009/11/20 06:00,2010/03/03 06:00,['2009/11/20 06:00'],"['2009/11/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/11/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/03/03 06:00 [medline]']","['vir.0.016022-0 [pii]', '10.1099/vir.0.016022-0 [doi]']",ppublish,J Gen Virol. 2010 Mar;91(Pt 3):616-21. doi: 10.1099/vir.0.016022-0.

METHODS: Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was used to detect the serum levels of EPO in 59 patients with AL, among whom 15 had complete remission without anemia and 44 had moderate or severe anemia (including 12 receiving the initial treatment, 13 with complete remission and concurrent anemia, and 19 with bone marrow suppression). Serum EPO was also detected in 15 IDA patients and 12 healthy individuals. RESULTS: The IDA patients and healthy individuals had similar serum EPO levels (P>0.05), and by comparison, the EPO levels were significantly increased in AL patients upon the initial treatment, those with bone marrow suppression and those with complete remission and anemia, but comparable between the latter 3 groups (P>0.05). Among the patients with complete remission, the EPO levels were significantly higher in anemic patients than in those without anemia (P<0.05), and the latter patients had similar EPO levels with the healthy individuals (P>0.05). In both AL and IDA patients with moderate or severe anemia, the serum EPO level was inversely correlated to the level of hemoglobin (r=-0.697 and -0.970, respectively, P<0.05). CONCLUSION: AL patients with anemia have significantly higher serum EPO levels than healthy individuals. In AL and IDA patients with moderate or severe anemia, EPO levels are inversely correlated to the level of hemoglobin, suggesting the integrity of the EPO synthesis mechanism in AL patients. Serum EPO level is also associated with bone marrow function in addition to hypoxia and hemoglobin levels, and hematopoiesis deficit in the early stage may be the main cause of anemia.","['Su, Na', 'Liu, Jin']","['Su N', 'Liu J']","['Department of Hematology, Shenzhen Hospital of Peking University, Shenzhen 518036, China. mailsuna@bjmu.edu.cn']",['chi'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",,China,Nan Fang Yi Ke Da Xue Xue Bao,Nan fang yi ke da xue xue bao = Journal of Southern Medical University,101266132,['11096-26-7 (Erythropoietin)'],IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Anemia/*blood/etiology', 'Erythropoietin/*blood', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*blood/complications', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Young Adult']",2009/11/20 06:00,2011/04/01 06:00,['2009/11/20 06:00'],"['2009/11/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/11/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/04/01 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Nan Fang Yi Ke Da Xue Xue Bao. 2009 Nov;29(11):2321-3.,29,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Given the anti-apoptotic functions of these proteins in vertebrates (e.g. human, mouse, and zebrafish) and the involvement of apoptotic regulation in immune responses, we studied the sequences of these genes and their transcript expression in Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) during innate immune responses to viral and bacterial stimuli. Based on previously generated Atlantic cod expressed sequence tags (ESTs), we identified partial cDNA sequences of putative orthologues of Atlantic cod NR-13, Mcl-1, and Bcl-X, and obtained the full-length cDNA, genomic, and promoter region sequences for these genes. The analyses of Atlantic cod cDNA sequences, and comparisons of the cod deduced amino acid sequences to putative orthologues in other species, revealed the presence of highly conserved Bcl-2 homology (BH) and transmembrane (TM) domains in the Atlantic cod sequences. Analysis of gene structure revealed conserved intron/exon boundaries within the coding regions of human and Atlantic cod putative orthologues. We found that an intron/exon boundary immediately following the codon for the 8th residue (tryptophan) of the BH2 domain exists in all anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 sub-family genes regardless of vast evolutionary distance. We also identified a non-coding exon in the Atlantic cod NR-13-like gene, which appears to be absent in its putative mammalian orthologues. Quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (QPCR) was used to study constitutive gene expression in six tissues (blood, brain, gill, head kidney, pyloric caecum, and spleen) of non-stressed juvenile cod; NR-13 and Bcl-X2 were most highly expressed in gill, whereas Mcl-1 and Bcl-X1 were most highly expressed in blood. In cod challenged with intraperitoneal (IP) injections of the viral mimic polyriboinosinic polyribocytidylic acid (pIC), (1) NR-13 mRNA expression was significantly up-regulated (compared to both 0h pre-injection and timed saline injected controls) in spleen at 6h post-injection and in head kidney at both 6 and 24h post-injection (HPI), and (2) both Mcl-1 and Bcl-X2 were significantly up-regulated (compared to both 0h pre-injection and timed saline injected controls) in spleen at 6 HPI. QPCR was used to show that, in cod challenged with IP injections of formalin-killed, atypical Aeromonas salmonicida (ASAL), only NR-13 appeared to be responsive (significantly up-regulated in spleen at 6 HPI compared to 0h pre-injection controls). Interestingly, QPCR showed that saline injection had a mild (less than 3-fold) but significant inductive effect (compared to 0h pre-injection controls) on both NR-13 and Mcl-1 transcript expression in spleen at 2 HPI. Although we only obtained partial cDNA and genomic sequences for Bcl-X2, sufficient evidence was accumulated to show that two Bcl-X paralogues exist in Atlantic cod, possibly due to the teleost-specific genome duplication event. Promoter regions for NR-13, Mcl-1, and Bcl-X1 were obtained and analyzed for the first time in fish, and potential regulatory sites (e.g. putative NF-kappaB binding sites) that were found in the promoter regions of NR-13 and Mcl-1 may account for their transcriptional activation by pIC.","['Feng, Charles Y', 'Rise, Matthew L']","['Feng CY', 'Rise ML']","[""Ocean Sciences Centre, Memorial University of Newfoundland, St John's, NL A1C 5S7, Canada.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20091117,England,Mol Immunol,Molecular immunology,7905289,"['0 (Antigens, Bacterial)', '0 (Antigens, Viral)', '0 (Fish Proteins)', '0 (Mcl1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (bcl-X Protein)']",IM,"['Alternative Splicing/genetics', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Antigens, Bacterial/immunology', 'Antigens, Viral/immunology', 'Atlantic Ocean', 'Base Sequence', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Conserved Sequence', 'Exons/genetics', 'Fish Proteins/chemistry/*genetics/metabolism', 'Gadus morhua/*genetics/microbiology/virology', 'Gene Expression Profiling', '*Gene Expression Regulation', 'Humans', 'Introns/genetics', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Open Reading Frames/genetics', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/genetics', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/chemistry/*genetics/metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA', 'Spleen/microbiology/virology', 'bcl-X Protein/chemistry/*genetics/metabolism']",2009/11/20 06:00,2010/02/20 06:00,['2009/11/20 06:00'],"['2009/09/10 00:00 [received]', '2009/10/07 00:00 [revised]', '2009/10/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/11/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/11/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/02/20 06:00 [medline]']","['S0161-5890(09)00767-6 [pii]', '10.1016/j.molimm.2009.10.011 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Immunol. 2010 Jan;47(4):763-84. doi: 10.1016/j.molimm.2009.10.011.

A new generic, once-daily 400-mg tablet of imatinib has been developed by a pharmaceutical company in Argentina, where the regulatory standard for marketing authorization of an imatinib generic is in vitro dissolution testing. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to assess the bioequivalence of a new generic film-coated test tablet formulation versus a film-coated reference tablet formulation of imatinib 400 mg. The local manufacturer seeks to validate the in vitro performance of this new formulation with a bioequivalence study. METHODS: A randomized, open-label, single-dose, fasting, 2-period, 2-sequence crossover design with a 2-week washout period was used in this study. The study population consisted of healthy male South American (Uruguayan) volunteers, who were assigned in a 1:1 ratio to a randomized sequence (test-reference or reference-test). In each period, the test or reference formulation was administered after an overnight fast. During the 72-hour follow-up period, participants were monitored for vital signs and symptoms. Blood samples were collected at 15 time points, including baseline, until 72 hours. Physical examination and laboratory tests (blood, urine) were repeated 1 week after study completion. A noncompartmental model was used to determine the pharmacokinetic parameters of imatinib. The 90% CIs of the test/reference ratios for AUC(0-infinity) and C(max) were determined; the test and reference formulations were considered bioequivalent if the 90% CIs were between 0.80 and 1.25. Adverse events were assessed by a nurse who administered a questionnaire while the healthy volunteers were admitted in the unit. RESULTS: The bioequivalence study was conducted in 30 Uruguayan male volunteers. Demographic characteristics (mean [SD]) included age, 27.8 (6.5) years; weight, 71.2 (9.8) kg; height, 1.71 (0.09) m; and body mass index, 24.3 (3.0) kg/m2. The mean (SD) of AUC(0-infinity) was 38,179 (15,504) ng/mL x h(-1) for the test formulation and 40,554 (17,027) ng/mL x h(-1) for the reference formulation. The mean of Cmax for the test formulation was 2472 (933) ng/mL, and the mean Tmax was 3.28 (0.93) hours. The mean of Cmax for the reference formulation was 2566 (963) ng/mL, and the mean T(max) was 3.63 (1.20) hours. The point estimates (90% CIs) for the test/reference ratios of the log-transformed AUC- and C(max) mean values were 0.95 (0.87-1.03) and 0.97 (0.89-1.05), respectively, which met the regulatory criteria for bioequivalence. Thirty-four mild to moderate adverse events were reported (13 with the test formulation and 21 with the reference formulation), and no serious or unexpected adverse events were observed during the study. The adverse events included 16 cases of headache, 13 cases of nausea, 4 cases of vomiting, and 1 episode of diarrhea. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study suggest that the test formulation of imatinib met the regulatory criteria for bioequivalence to the reference formulation in these healthy fasting male volunteers. Both formulations were generally well tolerated and appeared to have a similar adverse-event profile.","['Parrillo-Campiglia, Susana', 'Ercoli, Monica Cedres', 'Umpierrez, Ofelia', 'Rodriguez, Patricia', 'Marquez, Sara', 'Guarneri, Carolina', 'Estevez-Parrillo, Francisco T', 'Laurenz, Marilena', 'Estevez-Carrizo, Francisco E']","['Parrillo-Campiglia S', 'Ercoli MC', 'Umpierrez O', 'Rodriguez P', 'Marquez S', 'Guarneri C', 'Estevez-Parrillo FT', 'Laurenz M', 'Estevez-Carrizo FE']","['Center for Clinical Pharmacology, Bdbeq S.A., Hospital Italiano Umberto Primo, Montevideo, Uruguay.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Clin Ther,Clinical therapeutics,7706726,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Analysis of Variance', 'Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*pharmacokinetics', 'Argentina', 'Benzamides', 'Body Mass Index', 'Chemistry, Pharmaceutical', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Cross-Over Studies', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Models, Statistical', 'Piperazines/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*pharmacokinetics', 'Pyrimidines/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*pharmacokinetics', 'Quality Control', 'Spectrophotometry, Ultraviolet', 'Therapeutic Equivalency', 'Uruguay', 'Young Adult']",2009/11/20 06:00,2010/01/27 06:00,['2009/11/20 06:00'],"['2009/09/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/11/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/11/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/01/27 06:00 [medline]']","['S0149-2918(09)00366-X [pii]', '10.1016/j.clinthera.2009.10.009 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Ther. 2009 Oct;31(10):2224-32. doi: 10.1016/j.clinthera.2009.10.009.,31,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We describe the transcriptional changes in 84 trans-iliacal bone biopsies associated with BMD variations in postmenopausal females (50 to 86 years), aiming to identify genetic determinants of bone structure. The women were healthy or having a primary osteopenic or osteoporotic status with or without low energy fractures. The total cohort of 91 unrelated women representing a wide range of BMDs, were consecutively registered and submitted to global gene Affymetrix microarray expression analysis or histomorphometry. Among almost 23,000 expressed transcripts, a set represented by ACSL3 (acyl-CoA synthetase long-chain family member 3), NIPSNAP3B (nipsnap homolog 3B), DLEU2 (Deleted in lymphocytic leukemia, 2), C1ORF61 (Chromosome 1 open reading frame 61), DKK1 (Dickkopf homolog 1), SOST (Sclerostin), ABCA8, (ATP-binding cassette, sub-family A, member 8), and uncharacterized (AFFX-M27830-M-at), was significantly correlated to total hip BMD (5% false discovery rate) explaining 62% of the BMD variation expressed as T-score, 53% when adjusting for the influence of age (Z-score) and 44% when further adjusting for body mass index (BMI). Only SOST was previously associated to BMD, and the majority of the genes have previously not been associated with a bone phenotype. In molecular network analyses, SOST shows a strong, positive correlation with DKK1, both being members of the Wnt signaling pathway. The results provide novel insight in the underlying biology of bone metabolism and osteoporosis which is the ultimate consequence of low BMD.","['Reppe, Sjur', 'Refvem, Hilde', 'Gautvik, Vigdis T', 'Olstad, Ole K', 'Hovring, Per I', 'Reinholt, Finn P', 'Holden, Marit', 'Frigessi, Arnoldo', 'Jemtland, Rune', 'Gautvik, Kaare M']","['Reppe S', 'Refvem H', 'Gautvik VT', 'Olstad OK', 'Hovring PI', 'Reinholt FP', 'Holden M', 'Frigessi A', 'Jemtland R', 'Gautvik KM']","['Institute of Basic Medical Sciences, University of Oslo, Norway. sjur.reppe@medisin.uio.no']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20091114,United States,Bone,Bone,8504048,['0 (Genetic Markers)'],IM,"['Absorptiometry, Photon', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Bone Density/*genetics', 'Cohort Studies', 'Female', 'Genetic Markers/genetics', 'Genetic Variation/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Middle Aged', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Osteoporosis, Postmenopausal/*genetics/physiopathology', 'Postmenopause/*genetics/metabolism', 'Whites/*genetics']",2009/11/20 06:00,2010/09/21 06:00,['2009/11/20 06:00'],"['2009/06/25 00:00 [received]', '2009/10/22 00:00 [revised]', '2009/11/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/11/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/11/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/09/21 06:00 [medline]']","['S8756-3282(09)02019-5 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bone.2009.11.007 [doi]']",ppublish,Bone. 2010 Mar;46(3):604-12. doi: 10.1016/j.bone.2009.11.007.

Here we review the profile of nilotinib as a protein kinase inhibitor. Although an ATP-competitive inhibitor of Abl, nilotinib binds to a catalytically inactive conformation (DFG-out) of the activation loop. As a consequence of this, nilotinib exhibits time-dependent inhibition of Abl kinase in enzymatic assays, which can be extrapolated to other targets to explain differences between biochemical activity and cellular assays. Although these differences confound assessment of kinase selectivity, as assessed using a combination of protein binding and transphosphorylation assays, together with cellular autophosporylation and proliferation assays, well established kinase targets of nilotinib in rank order of inhibitory potency are DDR-1>DDR-2>BCR-Abl (Abl)>PDGFRalpha/beta>KIT>CSF-1R. In addition nilotinib has now been found to bind to both MAPK11 (p38beta) and MAPK12 (p38alpha), as well as with very high affinity to ZAK kinase. Although neither enzymatic nor cellular data are yet available to substantiate the drug as an inhibitor of ZAK phosphorylation, modeling predicts that it binds in an ATP-competitive fashion.","['Manley, Paul W', 'Drueckes, Peter', 'Fendrich, Gabriele', 'Furet, Pascal', 'Liebetanz, Janis', 'Martiny-Baron, Georg', 'Mestan, Jurgen', 'Trappe, Jorg', 'Wartmann, Markus', 'Fabbro, Doriano']","['Manley PW', 'Drueckes P', 'Fendrich G', 'Furet P', 'Liebetanz J', 'Martiny-Baron G', 'Mestan J', 'Trappe J', 'Wartmann M', 'Fabbro D']","['Novartis Institutes for Biomedical Research, Basel, Switzerland. paul.manley@novatis.com']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20091114,Netherlands,Biochim Biophys Acta,Biochimica et biophysica acta,0217513,"['0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8L70Q75FXE (Adenosine Triphosphate)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'F41401512X (nilotinib)']",IM,"['Adenosine Triphosphate/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/drug therapy/*enzymology', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/chemistry/therapeutic use', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors/*chemistry/metabolism', 'Pyrimidines/*chemistry/therapeutic use']",2009/11/20 06:00,2010/04/07 06:00,['2009/11/20 06:00'],"['2009/08/18 00:00 [received]', '2009/10/30 00:00 [revised]', '2009/11/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/11/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/11/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/04/07 06:00 [medline]']","['S1570-9639(09)00341-0 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bbapap.2009.11.008 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochim Biophys Acta. 2010 Mar;1804(3):445-53. doi: 10.1016/j.bbapap.2009.11.008.

Leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) is a growth factor that can maintain the pluripotency of mouse ES cells in culture. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) are nuclear receptor transcription factors that regulate growth and differentiation of many cell types. We have shown earlier that 15-Deoxy-(12,14)-Prostaglandin J2 (15d-PGJ2), a natural ligand for PPARgamma, inhibits LIF-induced proliferation of mouse ES cells in culture. In this study we demonstrate that the PPARgamma antagonist Bisphenol A diglycidyl ether (BADGE) and 2-Chloro-5-nitro-N-(4-pyridyl)benzamide (T0070907) reverse the inhibition of ES cell proliferation by PPARgamma agonists. Stable transfection of ES cells with a dominant negative PPARgamma1 mutant also reduced the inhibition of proliferation by PPARgamma agonists. While 15d-PGJ2 and ciglitazone-induced growth-arrest in ES cells by blocking LIF signaling, PPARgamma antagonists and dominant negative PPARgamma1 mutant reversed proliferation by restoring LIF-induced Tyk2-Stat3 signaling. These results suggest that PPARgamma regulates LIF-induced growth and self-renewal of mouse ES cells through Tyk2-Stat3 pathway.","['Mo, Caiqing', 'Chearwae, Wanida', 'Bright, John J']","['Mo C', 'Chearwae W', 'Bright JJ']","['Neuroscience Research Laboratory, Methodist Research Institute, Indianapolis, IN 46202, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,England,Cell Signal,Cellular signalling,8904683,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Benzhydryl Compounds)', '0 (Epoxy Compounds)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (PPAR gamma)', '0 (Pyridines)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (T 0070907)', '60203-57-8 (9-deoxy-delta-9-prostaglandin D2)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (TYK2 Kinase)', 'F3XRM1NX4H (2,2-bis(4-glycidyloxyphenyl)propane)', 'RXY07S6CZ2 (Prostaglandin D2)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Benzamides/pharmacology', 'Benzhydryl Compounds', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Embryonic Stem Cells/*cytology/metabolism', 'Epoxy Compounds/pharmacology', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'PPAR gamma/agonists/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Prostaglandin D2/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Pyridines/pharmacology', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'TYK2 Kinase/*metabolism']",2009/11/20 06:00,2010/03/10 06:00,['2009/11/20 06:00'],"['2009/10/13 00:00 [received]', '2009/11/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/11/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/11/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/03/10 06:00 [medline]']","['S0898-6568(09)00338-6 [pii]', '10.1016/j.cellsig.2009.11.003 [doi]']",ppublish,Cell Signal. 2010 Mar;22(3):495-500. doi: 10.1016/j.cellsig.2009.11.003.,22,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this study, we examined the roles of growth arrest-specific-6 (GAS6)/Mer axis in the interactions between E2A/PBX1-positive B-cell precursor ALL cells and the osteoblastic niche in the bone marrow. RESULTS: Data show that primary human osteoblasts secrete GAS6 in response to the Mer-overexpressed E2A/PBX1-positive ALL cells through mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling pathway and that leukemia cells migrate toward GAS6 using pathways activated by Mer. Importantly, GAS6 supports survival and prevents apoptosis from chemotherapy of E2A/PBX1-positive ALL cells by inducing dormancy. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that GAS6/Mer axis regulates homing and survival of the E2A/PBX1-positive B-cell precursor ALL in the bone marrow niche.","['Shiozawa, Yusuke', 'Pedersen, Elisabeth A', 'Taichman, Russell S']","['Shiozawa Y', 'Pedersen EA', 'Taichman RS']","['Department of Periodontics and Oral Medicine, University of Michigan School of Dentistry, Ann Arbor, MI 48109-1078, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",20091114,Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors)', '0 (Culture Media, Conditioned)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Pre-B-Cell Leukemia Transcription Factor 1)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (TCF3 protein, human)', '0 (growth arrest-specific protein 6)', '0 (pbx1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (MERTK protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (c-Mer Tyrosine Kinase)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors/*analysis', 'Bone Marrow/*pathology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival/drug effects/physiology', 'Chemotaxis', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Culture Media, Conditioned', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*analysis', 'Gene Expression', 'Humans', 'Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/metabolism/pharmacology/*physiology', 'Male', 'Osteoblasts/metabolism', 'Pre-B-Cell Leukemia Transcription Factor 1', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/enzymology/*pathology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*analysis/genetics/*physiology', 'Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/genetics/*physiology', 'c-Mer Tyrosine Kinase']",2009/11/20 06:00,2010/02/26 06:00,['2009/11/20 06:00'],"['2009/08/04 00:00 [received]', '2009/11/03 00:00 [revised]', '2009/11/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/11/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/11/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/02/26 06:00 [medline]']","['S0301-472X(09)00427-5 [pii]', '10.1016/j.exphem.2009.11.002 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Hematol. 2010 Feb;38(2):132-40. doi: 10.1016/j.exphem.2009.11.002.

Mucoepidermoid carcinoma of the parotid gland is by far the most common type of second salivary gland tumour; other types have rarely been reported. We describe here two patients with a second tumour of the salivary glands. CASE REPORTS: The first patient was a 22-year-old woman with a low grade mucoepidermoid carcinoma of the parotid gland, which developed 21 years after completion of chemoradiotherapy for acute lymphoblastic leukaemia. The second patient was a 40-year-old woman with an epithelial-myoepithelial carcinoma of the buccal mucosa, which arose 11 years after treatment for two malignant neoplasms - retroperitoneal liposarcoma and squamous cell carcinoma of the uterine cervix.

The regulatory mechanism that drives HOXC13 expression is mostly unknown. Our studies have demonstrated that HOXC13 is transcriptionally activated by the steroid hormone estrogen (17beta-estradiol; E2). The HOXC13 promoter contains several estrogen-response elements (EREs), including ERE1 and ERE2, which are close to the transcription start site, and are associated with E2-mediated activation of HOXC13. Knockdown of the estrogen receptors (ERs) ERalpha and ERbeta suppressed E2-mediated activation of HOXC13. Similarly, knockdown of mixed lineage leukemia histone methylase (MLL)3 suppressed E2-induced activation of HOXC13. MLLs (MLL1-MLL4) were bound to the HOXC13 promoter in an E2-dependent manner. Knockdown of either ERalpha or ERbeta affected the E2-dependent binding of MLLs (MLL1-MLL4) into HOXC13 EREs, suggesting critical roles of ERs in recruiting MLLs in the HOXC13 promoter. Overall, our studies have demonstrated that HOXC13 is transcriptionally regulated by E2 and MLLs, which, in coordination with ERalpha and ERbeta, play critical roles in this process. Although MLLs are known to regulate HOX genes, the roles of MLLs in hormone-mediated regulation of HOX genes are unknown. Herein, we have demonstrated that MLLs are critical players in E2-dependent regulation of the HOX gene.","['Ansari, Khairul I', 'Kasiri, Sahba', 'Hussain, Imran', 'Mandal, Subhrangsu S']","['Ansari KI', 'Kasiri S', 'Hussain I', 'Mandal SS']","['Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, The University of Texas at Arlington, Arlington, TX 76019, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,FEBS J,The FEBS journal,101229646,"['0 (Estrogen Receptor alpha)', '0 (Estrogen Receptor beta)', '0 (HOXC13 protein, human)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', '4TI98Z838E (Estradiol)', 'EC 2.1.1.- (Histone Methyltransferases)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)']",IM,"['Estradiol/*physiology', 'Estrogen Receptor alpha/physiology', 'Estrogen Receptor beta/physiology', 'Gene Knockdown Techniques', 'Histone Methyltransferases', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase/genetics/*physiology', 'Homeodomain Proteins/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/*physiology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2009/11/20 06:00,2010/01/08 06:00,['2009/11/20 06:00'],"['2009/11/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/11/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/01/08 06:00 [medline]']","['EJB7453 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1742-4658.2009.07453.x [doi]']",ppublish,FEBS J. 2009 Dec;276(24):7400-11. doi: 10.1111/j.1742-4658.2009.07453.x.,276,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Angiogenesis is regulated by the balance between pro- and antiangiogenic cytokines, which also indicates an important role of matrix metalloproteases (MMPs) and their natural inhibitors, tissue inhibitors of metalloproteases (TIMPs). We investigated the constitutive release of MMPs and TIMPs for a large group of consecutive AML patients. METHODS: AML cells were cultured in vitro either alone or together with microvascular endothelial cells, and levels of MMPs and TIMPs were determined in culture supernatants. RESULTS: AML cells showed constitutive release of several MMPs and TIMPs. For all patients, detectable MMP-10 release was observed, and most patients showed detectable release of at least one additional MMP, usually MMP-9 or MMP-2. A significant correlation was found between MMP-9 and TIMP-1 release and the release of several CCL and CXCL chemokines. MMP-9 release was higher for AML cells with monocytic differentiation corresponding to the FAB-subtype M4/M5 AML; it was mainly released in its inactive form, but endogenously active MMP-9 could be detected even in the presence of the constitutively released TIMP-1/2. Endothelial cells released relatively high levels of MMP-10, and these levels were further increased by coculture with AML cells. Patients achieving complete hematological remission after only one induction cycle showed relatively low constitutive MMP-2 release. CONCLUSION: We conclude that primary human AML cells show constitutive release of both MMPs and TIMPs, and this release may be important for leukemogenesis and possibly also for chemosensitivity.","['Reikvam, Hakon', 'Hatfield, Kimberley J', 'Oyan, Anne M', 'Kalland, Karl H', 'Kittang, Astrid O', 'Bruserud, Oystein']","['Reikvam H', 'Hatfield KJ', 'Oyan AM', 'Kalland KH', 'Kittang AO', 'Bruserud O']","['Institute of Internal Medicine, Division for Hematology, University of Bergen, Bergen, Norway.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20091117,England,Eur J Haematol,European journal of haematology,8703985,"['0 (3-ingenyl angelate)', ""0 (4(2'-aminoethyl)amino-1,8-dimethylimidazo(1,2-a)quinoxaline)"", '0 (Angiopoietin-2)', '0 (Anthracyclines)', '0 (Boronic Acids)', '0 (Chemokines)', '0 (Culture Media, Serum-Free)', '0 (Diterpenes)', '0 (Imidazoles)', '0 (Matrix Metalloproteinase Inhibitors)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Protease Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrazines)', '0 (Quinoxalines)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Tissue Inhibitor of Metalloproteinases)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '69G8BD63PP (Bortezomib)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor, TIE-2)', 'EC 3.4.24.- (Matrix Metalloproteinases)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Angiopoietin-2/pharmacology', 'Anthracyclines/administration & dosage', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Boronic Acids/pharmacology', 'Bortezomib', 'Cells, Cultured/cytology', 'Chemokines/metabolism', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Culture Media, Serum-Free/pharmacology', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage', 'Diterpenes/pharmacology', 'Endothelial Cells/cytology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Imidazoles/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/drug therapy/enzymology/*pathology', 'Male', 'Matrix Metalloproteinase Inhibitors', 'Matrix Metalloproteinases/*metabolism', 'Middle Aged', 'NF-kappa B/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*metabolism', 'Protease Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Pyrazines/pharmacology', 'Quinoxalines/pharmacology', 'Receptor, TIE-2/antagonists & inhibitors/physiology', 'Recombinant Proteins/pharmacology', 'Tissue Inhibitor of Metalloproteinases/*metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/enzymology/metabolism']",2009/11/20 06:00,2010/03/27 06:00,['2009/11/20 06:00'],"['2009/11/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/11/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/03/27 06:00 [medline]']","['EJH1382 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1600-0609.2009.01382.x [doi]']",ppublish,Eur J Haematol. 2010 Mar;84(3):239-51. doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0609.2009.01382.x.

However, gliomas are highly radioresistant and recurrence is nearly universal. Results from our laboratory and other groups suggest that cancer stem cells contribute to radioresistance in gliomas and breast cancers. The Notch pathway is critically implicated in stem cell fate determination and cancer. In this study, we show that inhibition of Notch pathway with gamma-secretase inhibitors (GSIs) renders the glioma stem cells more sensitive to radiation at clinically relevant doses. GSIs enhance radiation-induced cell death and impair clonogenic survival of glioma stem cells but not non-stem glioma cells. Expression of the constitutively active intracellular domains of Notch1 or Notch2 protect glioma stem cells against radiation. Notch inhibition with GSIs does not alter the DNA damage response of glioma stem cells after radiation but rather reduces Akt activity and Mcl-1 levels. Finally, knockdown of Notch1 or Notch2 sensitizes glioma stem cells to radiation and impairs xenograft tumor formation.

In this study, we retrospectively analyzed clinical and cytogenetic data from 435 Chinese adult primary MDS patients. In addition, we evaluated the prognostic value of the World Health Organization classification as well as six prognostic scoring systems in these patients. The median follow-up time was 25.1 months (5.5-53.2). Of the 435 patients, 186 (42.8%) had died and 40 (9.2%) had progressed to acute myeloid leukemia. Multivariate analysis identified older age, higher percent of marrow blasts, and poor-risk IPSS cytogenetics as characteristics associated with worse survival and higher risk of leukemia transformation. Low platelets, hemoglobin, and mean corpuscular volume were independent factors associated only with worse survival. Among the 424 patients in whom the results of cytogenetic analyses were available, 164 (38.7%) showed karyotypic abnormalities. Incidence of trisomy 8 was common but sole del(5q) was rare in Chinese MDS patients. For predicting survival, most scoring systems were meaningful for stratifying patients into different subgroups, with the exception of the WPSS scoring system. For predicting leukemia evolution, the Spanish scoring system was most effective. Patients with RAEB-2 showed different prognoses from those with RAEB-1. However, there was no significant difference in prognoses between patients with refractory cytopenia with multilineage dysplasia (RCMD) from RA or RARS.

Cyclic adenosine monophosphate (AMP) response element-binding protein (CREB), a leucine zipper transcription factor, is expressed at a high level in synovial cells of patients with RA. Although CREB transactivates IL-6 expression in vascular smooth muscle cells, the relation between CREB expression and IL-6 production from arthritic synovial cells remains unclear. In this study, to determine whether CREB is implicated in IL-6 production from arthritic synovial cells, a dominant negative molecule of activation transcription factor 1 (ATF-1) was transfected into synovial cells obtained from arthritic joints of env-pX rats. These transgenic rats carrying the env-pX gene of human T-cell leukemia virus type-1 develop destructive arthritis with high titers of serum rheumatoid factor and are thus regarded as a suitable model of RA. The dominant negative ATF-1 (ATF-1DN) constitutes a heterodimer with CREB and inhibits CREB function, as CREB/ATF-1DN heterodimers no longer bind to the target sequence of CREB. We showed that transfection of ATF-1DN significantly reduced IL-6 production from arthritic synovial cells. These findings suggest that CREB is implicated in IL-6 production from synovial cells and plays an important role in RA pathogenesis.","['Ishizu, Akihiro', 'Abe, Asami', 'Miyatake, Yukiko', 'Baba, Tomohisa', 'Iinuma, Chihiro', 'Tomaru, Utano', 'Yoshiki, Takashi']","['Ishizu A', 'Abe A', 'Miyatake Y', 'Baba T', 'Iinuma C', 'Tomaru U', 'Yoshiki T']","['Faculty of Health Sciences, Hokkaido University, Kita-12, Nishi-5, Kita-ku, Sapporo, 060-0812, Japan. aishizu@med.hokudai.ac.jp']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20091114,England,Mod Rheumatol,Modern rheumatology,100959226,"['0 (Interleukin-6)', 'EC 2.3.1.48 (CREB-Binding Protein)', 'EC 2.3.1.48 (Crebbp protein, rat)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Arthritis, Rheumatoid/*immunology/metabolism', 'CREB-Binding Protein/*metabolism', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-6/*metabolism', 'Rats', 'Rats, Transgenic', 'Synovial Membrane/*metabolism']",2009/11/19 06:00,2010/07/24 06:00,['2009/11/19 06:00'],"['2009/09/02 00:00 [received]', '2009/10/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/11/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/11/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/07/24 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s10165-009-0245-2 [doi]'],ppublish,Mod Rheumatol. 2010 Apr;20(2):134-8. doi: 10.1007/s10165-009-0245-2.

The BCR-ABL inhibitor imatinib mesylate (IM) has improved survival in all phases of CML and is the standard of care for newly diagnosed patients in chronic phase. Despite the very significant therapeutic benefits of IM, a small minority of patients with early stage disease do not benefit optimally while IM therapy in patients with advanced disease is of modest benefit in many. Diverse mechanisms may be responsible for IM failures, with point mutations within the Bcr-Abl kinase domain being amongst the most common resistance mechanisms described in patients with advanced CML. The development of novel agents designed to overcome IM resistance, while still primarily targeted on BCR-ABL, led to the creation of the high affinity aminopyrimidine inhibitor, nilotinib. Nilotinib is much more potent as a BCR-ABL inhibitor than IM and inhibits both wild type and IM-resistant BCR-ABL with significant clinical activity across the entire spectrum of BCR-ABL mutants with the exception of T315I. The selection of a second generation tyrosine kinase inhibitor to rescue patients with imatinib failure will be based on several factors including age, co-morbid medical problems and ABL kinase mutational profile. It should be noted that while the use of targeted BCR-ABL kinase inhibitors in CML represents a paradigm shift in CML management these agents are not likely to have activity against the quiescent CML stem cell pool. The purpose of this review is to summarize the pre-clinical and clinical data on nilotinib in patients with CML who have failed prior therapy with IM or dasatinib.","['Swords, Ronan', 'Mahalingam, Devalingam', 'Padmanabhan, Swaminathan', 'Carew, Jennifer', 'Giles, Francis']","['Swords R', 'Mahalingam D', 'Padmanabhan S', 'Carew J', 'Giles F']","['Institute for Drug Development, Cancer Therapy and Research Centre, University of Texas Health Science Centre at San Antonio, 7979 Wurzbach Road, San Antonio, TX 78229, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20090921,New Zealand,Drug Des Devel Ther,"Drug design, development and therapy",101475745,,,,2009/11/19 06:00,2009/11/19 06:01,['2009/11/19 06:00'],"['2009/11/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/11/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2009/11/19 06:01 [medline]']",['10.2147/dddt.s3069 [doi]'],epublish,Drug Des Devel Ther. 2009 Sep 21;3:89-101. doi: 10.2147/dddt.s3069.,3,,,PMC2769239,,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['chronic myeloid leukemia', 'imatinib', 'nilotinib']",,,,,,,,,,,

We previously demonstrated doxorubicin (DOX) resistance in K562 human leukemia cells that was associated with upregulation of glyoxalase 1 (GLO-1) and histone H3 expression. The thiazolidinedione troglitazone (TRG) downregulated GLO-1 expression and further upregulated histone H3 expression and post-translational modifications in these cells, leading to a regained sensitivity to DOX. Given the pleiotropic effects of epigenetic changes in cancer development, we hypothesized that TRG may downregulate the multiple drug resistance (MDR) phenotype in a variety of cancer cells. To test this, MCF7 human breast cancer cells and K562 cells were cultured in the presence of low-dose DOX to establish DOX-resistant cell lines (K562/DOX and MCF7/DOX). The MDR phenotype was confirmed by Western blot analysis of the 170 kDa P-glycoprotein (Pgp) drug efflux pump multiple drug resistance protein 1 (MDR-1), and the breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP). TRG markedly decreased expression of both MDR-1 and BCRP in these cells, resulting in sensitivity to DOX. Silencing of MDR-1 expression also sensitized MCF7/DOX cells to DOX. Use of the specific and irreversible peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARgamma) inhibitor GW9662 in the nanomolar range not only demonstrated that the action of TRG on MCF/DOX was PPARgamma-independent, but indicated that PPARgamma may play a role in the MDR phenotype, which is antagonized by TRG. We conclude that TRG is potentially a useful adjunct therapy in chemoresistant cancers.","['Davies, Gerald F', 'Juurlink, Bernhard H J', 'Harkness, Troy A A']","['Davies GF', 'Juurlink BH', 'Harkness TA']","['Department of Anatomy and Cell Biology, College of Medicine, University of Saskatchewan, 107 Wiggins Road, Saskatoon, SK, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090921,New Zealand,Drug Des Devel Ther,"Drug design, development and therapy",101475745,,,,2009/11/19 06:00,2009/11/19 06:01,['2009/11/19 06:00'],"['2009/11/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/11/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2009/11/19 06:01 [medline]']",['10.2147/dddt.s3314 [doi]'],epublish,Drug Des Devel Ther. 2009 Sep 21;3:79-88. doi: 10.2147/dddt.s3314.,3,,,PMC2769242,,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['breast cancer resistance protein-1', 'chemotherapy', 'doxorubicin', 'multiple drug resistance', 'multiple drug resistance protein 1']",,,,,,,,,,,

The most common mechanism of acquired resistance has been traced to Bcr-Abl kinase domain mutations. Several strategies have been developed to overcome the problem of imatinib resistance, including imatinib dose escalation, novel targeted agents and combination treatments. A second generation of tyrosine kinase inhibitors was developed, which displays increased potency towards Bcr-Abl and is able to target the majority of CML mutant clones. Nilotinib (Tasigna, AMN107, Novartis) is a close analog of imatinib with approximately 20-fold higher potency for BCR-ABL kinase inhibition. Preclinical and clinical investigations demonstrate that nilotinib effectively overcomes imatinib resistance, and has induced high rates of hematologic and cytogenetic responses in CML post imatinib failure, with a good tolerance.

For microarray and other high-dimensional data, the presence of many noise variables may mask underlying clustering structures. Hence removing noise variables via variable selection is necessary. For simultaneous variable selection and parameter estimation, existing penalized likelihood approaches in model-based clustering analysis all assume a common diagonal covariance matrix across clusters, which however may not hold in practice. To analyze high-dimensional data, particularly those with relatively low sample sizes, this article introduces a novel approach that shrinks the variances together with means, in a more general situation with cluster-specific (diagonal) covariance matrices. Furthermore, selection of grouped variables via inclusion or exclusion of a group of variables altogether is permitted by a specific form of penalty, which facilitates incorporating subject-matter knowledge, such as gene functions in clustering microarray samples for disease subtype discovery. For implementation, EM algorithms are derived for parameter estimation, in which the M-steps clearly demonstrate the effects of shrinkage and thresholding. Numerical examples, including an application to acute leukemia subtype discovery with microarray gene expression data, are provided to demonstrate the utility and advantage of the proposed method.","['Xie, Benhuai', 'Pan, Wei', 'Shen, Xiaotong']","['Xie B', 'Pan W', 'Shen X']","['Division of Biostatistics, School of Public Health, University of Minnesota, benhuaix@biostat.umn.edu.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Electron J Stat,Electronic journal of statistics,101480209,,,,2008/01/01 00:00,2008/01/01 00:01,['2009/11/19 06:00'],"['2009/11/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2008/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2008/01/01 00:01 [medline]']",['10.1214/08-EJS194 [doi]'],ppublish,Electron J Stat. 2008;2:168-212. doi: 10.1214/08-EJS194.,2,"['R01 GM081535/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 GM081535-01/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 GM081535-02/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL065462/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",,PMC2777718,['NIHMS127583'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Consistent with a role as proto-oncogene, SnoN negatively regulates TGF-beta signalling, through its interactions with Smad complexes. Thus, SnoN inhibits the growth inhibitory effect of TGF-beta, which is considered as the basis for the tumour suppressor activity of TGF-beta signalling. In this issue of The EMBO Journal, Pan et al (2009) now demonstrate that SnoN also functions as a tumour suppressor, independently of its role in Smad signalling. The tumour suppressor role of SnoN results from its interaction with the promyelocytic leukaemia (PML) protein and the accumulation of SnoN in PML nuclear bodies, thus allowing SnoN to stabilize p53 and induce premature senescence.","['Lamouille, Samy', 'Derynck, Rik']","['Lamouille S', 'Derynck R']","['Department of Cell and Tissue Biology, Programs in Cell Biology and Developmental Biology, University of California at San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Comment']",,England,EMBO J,The EMBO journal,8208664,"['0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (MAS1 protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Mas)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (SKIL protein, human)', '0 (Smad Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Transforming Growth Factor beta)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/genetics', 'Genes, Tumor Suppressor/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/genetics/*physiology', 'Mice', 'Models, Biological', 'Oncogenes/*physiology', 'Proto-Oncogene Mas', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics/*physiology', 'Signal Transduction/genetics', 'Smad Proteins/metabolism/physiology', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/physiology', 'Transforming Growth Factor beta/metabolism/physiology']",2009/11/19 06:00,2009/12/16 06:00,['2009/11/19 06:00'],"['2009/11/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/11/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2009/12/16 06:00 [medline]']","['emboj2009311 [pii]', '10.1038/emboj.2009.311 [doi]']",ppublish,EMBO J. 2009 Nov 18;28(22):3459-60. doi: 10.1038/emboj.2009.311.,28,,,PMC2782103,,,,,,,['EMBO J. 2009 Nov 18;28(22):3500-13.

Recent evidences suggest that GSK-3beta positively regulates human pancreatic cancer and leukaemia cell survival in part through regulation of nuclear factor (NF-kappaB)-mediated expression of anti-apoptotic molecules. Our objectives were to determine the expression pattern of GSK-3beta and to assess the anti-cancer effect of GSK-3beta inhibition in RCC. METHODS: Immunohistochemistry and nuclear/cytosolic fractionation were performed to determine the expression pattern of GSK-3beta in human RCCs. We used small molecule inhibitor, RNA interference, western blotting, quantitative RT-PCR, BrDU incorporation and MTS assays to study the effect of GSK-3beta inactivation on renal cancer cell proliferation and survival. RESULTS: We detected aberrant nuclear accumulation of GSK-3beta in RCC cell lines and in 68 out of 74 (91.89%) human RCCs. We found that pharmacological inhibition of GSK-3 led to a decrease in proliferation and survival of renal cancer cells. We observed that inhibition of GSK-3 results in decreased expression of NF-kappaB target genes Bcl-2 and XIAP and a subsequent increase in renal cancer cell apoptosis. Moreover, we show that GSK-3 inhibitor and Docetaxel synergistically suppress proliferation and survival of renal cancer cells. CONCLUSIONS: Our results show nuclear accumulation of GSK-3beta as a new marker of human RCC, identify that GSK-3 positively regulates RCC cell survival and proliferation and suggest inhibition of GSK-3 as a new promising approach in the treatment of human renal cancer.","['Bilim, V', 'Ougolkov, A', 'Yuuki, K', 'Naito, S', 'Kawazoe, H', 'Muto, A', 'Oya, M', 'Billadeau, D', 'Motoyama, T', 'Tomita, Y']","['Bilim V', 'Ougolkov A', 'Yuuki K', 'Naito S', 'Kawazoe H', 'Muto A', 'Oya M', 'Billadeau D', 'Motoyama T', 'Tomita Y']","['Department of Urology, Yamagata University School of Medicine, Iida-nishi 2-2-2, Yamagata 990-9585, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20091117,England,Br J Cancer,British journal of cancer,0370635,"['0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Taxoids)', '0 (Thiazoles)', '0 (X-Linked Inhibitor of Apoptosis Protein)', '0 (XIAP protein, human)', '15H5577CQD (Docetaxel)', ""87KSH90Q6D (N-(4-methoxybenzyl)-N'-(5-nitro-1,3-thiazol-2-yl)urea)"", '8W8T17847W (Urea)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (GSK3B protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3 beta)', 'EC 2.7.11.26 (Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Carcinoma, Renal Cell/*enzymology/pathology/therapy', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cell Survival', 'Docetaxel', 'Female', 'Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3/*analysis/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics', 'Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3 beta', 'Humans', 'Kidney Neoplasms/*enzymology/pathology/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'NF-kappa B/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Taxoids/administration & dosage', 'Thiazoles/administration & dosage', 'Urea/administration & dosage/analogs & derivatives', 'X-Linked Inhibitor of Apoptosis Protein/antagonists & inhibitors']",2009/11/19 06:00,2010/01/08 06:00,['2009/11/19 06:00'],"['2009/11/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/11/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/01/08 06:00 [medline]']","['6605437 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.bjc.6605437 [doi]']",ppublish,Br J Cancer. 2009 Dec 15;101(12):2005-14. doi: 10.1038/sj.bjc.6605437.

But the effect of CD52 mAb on intestinal intraepithelial lymphocytes (IELs) was unknown. The aim of this study was to assess the influence of anti-mouse CD52 mAb on IELs. METHODS: Twenty male C57BL/6 mice were randomly assigned to a treatment or a control group. The treatment group received anti-mouse CD52 mAb (20 mug, subcutaneously), whereas the control group received the same volume of phosphate-buffered solution. On the seventh day after treatment, mice were killed, and ileum and colon were obtained for histopathology and immunohistochemistry examination, IELs were isolated for flow cytometric analysis and 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide analysis. Furthermore, the intestinal permeability was measured by lactulose-mannitol test. RESULTS: The number and viability of IELs were decreased significantly in treatment compared with the control group. There were significant differences between the two groups considering IELs phenotypes. In addition, the proportion of apoptotic IELs in CD52 mAb treatment group was significantly higher than the control group (19.59%+/-3.13% and 2.02%+/-0.33%, respectively; P<0.05). Furthermore, lactulose-mannitol test showed a marked increase intestinal permeability after CD52 treatment (90.38%+/-5.96% and 46.02%+/-6.40%, respectively; P<0.05). CONCLUSION: Anti-mouse CD52 mAb could induce more IELs to apoptosis and result in reducing the number of IELs, which may disrupt intestinal barrier function.","['Qu, Linlin', 'Li, Qiurong', 'Jiang, Haitao', 'Gu, Lili', 'Zhang, Qiang', 'Wang, Chenyang', 'Li, Jieshou']","['Qu L', 'Li Q', 'Jiang H', 'Gu L', 'Zhang Q', 'Wang C', 'Li J']","[""School of Medicine, Nanjing University, Nanjing, People's Republic of China.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Transplantation,Transplantation,0132144,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (CD52 Antigen)', '0 (Glycoproteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/*administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Antigens, CD', 'Antigens, Neoplasm', 'Apoptosis/immunology', 'CD52 Antigen', 'Cell Survival/immunology', 'Epithelium/immunology/metabolism/pathology', 'Glycoproteins/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Immunity, Mucosal', 'Injections, Subcutaneous', 'Intestinal Mucosa/metabolism', 'Intestines/*immunology/*pathology', 'Lymphocyte Count', 'Lymphocyte Depletion/adverse effects', 'Lymphocytes/*immunology/pathology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Permeability', 'Transplantation Immunology']",2009/11/19 06:00,2009/12/16 06:00,['2009/11/19 06:00'],"['2009/11/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/11/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2009/12/16 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1097/TP.0b013e3181b47c61 [doi]', '00007890-200909270-00006 [pii]']",ppublish,Transplantation. 2009 Sep 27;88(6):766-72. doi: 10.1097/TP.0b013e3181b47c61.,88,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Cryopreserving testicular tissue before chemotherapy and autotransplantation of spermatogonial stem cells at a later stage could theoretically allow for restoration of fertility. OBJECTIVE: To establish in vitro propagation of human spermatogonial stem cells from small testicular biopsies to obtain an adequate number of cells for successful transplantation. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Study performed from April 2007 to July 2009 using testis material donated by 6 adult men who underwent orchidectomy as part of prostate cancer treatment. Testicular cells were isolated and cultured in supplemented StemPro medium; germline stem cell clusters that arose were subcultured on human placental laminin-coated dishes in the same medium. Presence of spermatogonia was determined by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction and immunofluorescence for spermatogonial markers. To test for the presence of functional spermatogonial stem cells in culture, xenotransplantation to testes of immunodeficient mice was performed, and migrated human spermatogonial stem cells after transplantation were detected by COT-1 fluorescence in situ hybridization. The number of colonized spermatogonial stem cells transplanted at early and later points during culture were counted to determine propagation. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Propagation of spermatogonial stem cells over time. RESULTS: Testicular cells could be cultured and propagated up to 15 weeks. Germline stem cell clusters arose in the testicular cell cultures from all 6 men and could be subcultured and propagated up to 28 weeks. Expression of spermatogonial markers on both the RNA and protein level was maintained throughout the entire culture period. In 4 of 6 men, xenotransplantation to mice demonstrated the presence of functional spermatogonial stem cells, even after prolonged in vitro culture. Spermatogonial stem cell numbers increased 53-fold within 19 days in the testicular cell culture and increased 18,450-fold within 64 days in the germline stem cell subculture. CONCLUSION: Long-term culture and propagation of human spermatogonial stem cells in vitro is achievable.","['Sadri-Ardekani, Hooman', 'Mizrak, Sefika C', 'van Daalen, Saskia K M', 'Korver, Cindy M', 'Roepers-Gajadien, Hermien L', 'Koruji, Morteza', 'Hovingh, Suzanne', 'de Reijke, Theo M', 'de la Rosette, Jean J M C H', 'van der Veen, Fulco', 'de Rooij, Dirk G', 'Repping, Sjoerd', 'van Pelt, Ans M M']","['Sadri-Ardekani H', 'Mizrak SC', 'van Daalen SK', 'Korver CM', 'Roepers-Gajadien HL', 'Koruji M', 'Hovingh S', 'de Reijke TM', 'de la Rosette JJ', 'van der Veen F', 'de Rooij DG', 'Repping S', 'van Pelt AM']","['Center for Reproductive Medicine, Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, University of Amsterdam, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,JAMA,JAMA,7501160,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (Culture Media)', '0 (ITGB1BP1 protein, human)', '0 (Integrin alpha6)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Zinc Finger Protein)', '147855-37-6 (ZBTB16 protein, human)']",IM,"['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing', 'Adult', 'Animals', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cryopreservation', 'Culture Media', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Gene Expression', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Integrin alpha6/genetics', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/genetics', 'Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors/genetics', 'Male', 'Membrane Proteins/genetics', 'Mice', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Zinc Finger Protein', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Spermatogonia/*cytology/physiology/*transplantation', '*Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Stem Cells/*cytology/physiology', 'Testis/cytology', 'Transplantation, Heterologous']",2009/11/19 06:00,2009/12/16 06:00,['2009/11/19 06:00'],"['2009/11/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/11/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2009/12/16 06:00 [medline]']","['302/19/2127 [pii]', '10.1001/jama.2009.1689 [doi]']",ppublish,JAMA. 2009 Nov 18;302(19):2127-34. doi: 10.1001/jama.2009.1689.,302,,,,,,['JAMA. 2010 Feb 3;303(5):422'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we provide first evidence that small-molecule X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis (XIAP) inhibitors in combination with the death receptor ligand tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) present a novel approach to trigger apoptosis in CLL, including subgroups with resistant disease or unfavorable prognosis. XIAP, cellular IAP (cIAP) 1, and cIAP2 are expressed at high levels in primary CLL samples. Proof-of-concept studies in CLL cell lines show that subtoxic concentrations of XIAP inhibitors significantly enhance TRAIL-induced apoptosis and also sensitize for CD95-mediated apoptosis. Importantly also in primary CLL samples, XIAP inhibitor acts in concert with TRAIL to trigger apoptosis in 18 of 27 (67%) cases. This XIAP inhibitor-induced and TRAIL-induced apoptosis involves caspase-3 activation and is blocked by the caspase inhibitor zVAD.fmk. The cooperative interaction of XIAP inhibitor and TRAIL is even evident in distinct subgroups of patients with poor prognostic features (i.e., with 17p deletion, TP53 mutation, chemotherapy-refractory disease, or unmutated V(H) genes). Interestingly, cases with unmutated V(H) genes were significantly more sensitive to XIAP inhibitor-induced and TRAIL-induced apoptosis compared with V(H) gene-mutated samples, pointing to a role of B-cell receptor signaling in apoptosis regulation. By showing that XIAP inhibitors in combination with TRAIL present a new strategy to trigger apoptosis even in resistant forms and poor prognostic subgroups of CLL, our findings have important implications for the development of apoptosis-based therapies in CLL.","['Loeder, Sandra', 'Zenz, Thorsten', 'Schnaiter, Andrea', 'Mertens, Daniel', 'Winkler, Dirk', 'Dohner, Hartmut', 'Debatin, Klaus-Michael', 'Stilgenbauer, Stephan', 'Fulda, Simone']","['Loeder S', 'Zenz T', 'Schnaiter A', 'Mertens D', 'Winkler D', 'Dohner H', 'Debatin KM', 'Stilgenbauer S', 'Fulda S']","[""University Children's Hospital, Ulm, Germany.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20091117,United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand)', '0 (X-Linked Inhibitor of Apoptosis Protein)', '0 (XIAP protein, human)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects/physiology', 'B-Lymphocytes/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Drug Synergism', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand/*pharmacology', 'X-Linked Inhibitor of Apoptosis Protein/*antagonists & inhibitors']",2009/11/19 06:00,2009/12/22 06:00,['2009/11/19 06:00'],"['2009/11/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/11/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2009/12/22 06:00 [medline]']","['0008-5472.CAN-09-2604 [pii]', '10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-09-2604 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 2009 Dec 1;69(23):8977-86. doi: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-09-2604.

The 10 human rDNA clusters represent <0.5% of the diploid human genome but are critically important for cellular viability. Individual genes within rDNA clusters possess very high levels of sequence identity with respect to each other and are present in high local concentration, making them ideal substrates for genomic rearrangement driven by dysregulated homologous recombination. We recently developed a sensitive physical assay capable of detecting recombination-mediated genomic restructuring in the rDNA by monitoring changes in lengths of the individual clusters. To prove that this dysregulated recombination is a potential driving force of genomic instability in human cancer, we assayed the rDNA for structural rearrangements in prospectively recruited adult patients with either lung or colorectal cancer, and pediatric patients with leukemia. We find that over half of the adult solid tumors show detectable rDNA rearrangements relative to either surrounding nontumor tissue or normal peripheral blood. In contrast, we find a greatly reduced frequency of rDNA alterations in pediatric leukemia. This finding makes rDNA restructuring one of the most common chromosomal alterations in adult solid tumors, illustrates the dynamic plasticity of the human genome, and may prove to have either prognostic or predictive value in disease progression.","['Stults, Dawn M', 'Killen, Michael W', 'Williamson, Erica P', 'Hourigan, Jon S', 'Vargas, H David', 'Arnold, Susanne M', 'Moscow, Jeffrey A', 'Pierce, Andrew J']","['Stults DM', 'Killen MW', 'Williamson EP', 'Hourigan JS', 'Vargas HD', 'Arnold SM', 'Moscow JA', 'Pierce AJ']","['Graduate Center for Toxicology, University of Kentucky, Lexington, Kentucky 40536-0096, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20091117,United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (DNA, Ribosomal)']",IM,"['Adenocarcinoma/genetics', 'Adult', 'Carcinoma, Squamous Cell/genetics', 'Child', 'Colorectal Neoplasms/*genetics', 'DNA, Ribosomal/*genetics', 'Genes, rRNA/*genetics', 'Genomic Instability', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*genetics', 'Lung Neoplasms/*genetics', 'Multigene Family', 'Recombination, Genetic']",2009/11/19 06:00,2009/12/22 06:00,['2009/11/19 06:00'],"['2009/11/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/11/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2009/12/22 06:00 [medline]']","['0008-5472.CAN-09-2680 [pii]', '10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-09-2680 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 2009 Dec 1;69(23):9096-104. doi: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-09-2680.

P2X family receptors are ATP-gated plasma membrane ion channels with diverse biological functions. Their distribution patterns and significance in pediatric leukemias have not been established. Here we investigated the expression of P2X receptors in BMMC samples from Chinese pediatric acute leukemias. Real-time PCR and Western blot results showed that P2X1, P2X4, P2X5 and P2X7 receptors were simultaneously over expressed in leukemias compared with controls, whereas P2X2, P2X3 and P2X6 were absent or marginally expressed in both groups. It was worth noting that the co-expression feature of them, especially between P2X4 and P2X7, could be observed and the highest expression of P2X7 was detected in relapsed patients. Moreover, concomitant decrease of P2X4, P2X5 and P2X7 expressions was observed at CR stage in a follow-up study. Functional P2X7 was also verified. These results suggested that P2X1, P2X4, P2X5 and P2X7 were hematopoiesis-related P2X receptors, and their signaling, especially for P2X7, might play important roles in pediatric leukemias. P2X receptors might co-operatively contribute to the malignant phenotype in human pediatric leukemias.","['Chong, Jing-Hui', 'Zheng, Guo-Guang', 'Zhu, Xiao-Fan', 'Guo, Ye', 'Wang, Lin', 'Ma, Cui-Hua', 'Liu, Shu-Yan', 'Xu, Lin-Lin', 'Lin, Yong-Min', 'Wu, Ke-Fu']","['Chong JH', 'Zheng GG', 'Zhu XF', 'Guo Y', 'Wang L', 'Ma CH', 'Liu SY', 'Xu LL', 'Lin YM', 'Wu KF']","['State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin 300020, PR China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20091115,United States,Biochem Biophys Res Commun,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,0372516,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Receptors, Purinergic P2)', '0 (Receptors, Purinergic P2X)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Asians', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*metabolism', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Purinergic P2/*biosynthesis', 'Receptors, Purinergic P2X']",2009/11/19 06:00,2010/03/17 06:00,['2009/11/19 06:00'],"['2009/11/11 00:00 [received]', '2009/11/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/11/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/11/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/03/17 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-291X(09)02264-5 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bbrc.2009.11.087 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Biophys Res Commun. 2010 Jan 1;391(1):498-504. doi: 10.1016/j.bbrc.2009.11.087.

It is known that human MCL-1 gene undergoes differential splicing and yields three mRNAs encoding antiapoptotic MCL-1L and proapoptotic MCL-1S and MCL-1ES. However, no MCL-1 variants have been reported in mouse cells. We report here a new splicing variant of mouse Mcl-1, Mcl-1V, that is expressed in a variety of mouse normal and tumor cell lines and tissues. Comparative sequence analysis of the full-length Mcl-1 and Mcl-1V cDNAs suggested that Mcl-1V mRNA results from splicing within the first coding exon of Mcl-1 gene at a non-canonical donor-acceptor pair. MCL-1V lacks 46 amino acid residues within the N-terminal region of MCL-1. It localizes in mitochondria and inhibits anoxia- and anticancer drug-induced apoptosis as potent as MCL-1, and decayed less rapidly than MCL-1 in the cells undergoing apoptosis.

Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDSs) are a group of chronic conditions that involve dysplastic hematopoiesis, peripheral blood cytopenias, and a high incidence of progression into leukemia. METHODS: We describe the intriguing association of these two premalignant conditions (EV and MDS) in one patient. These diagnoses were confirmed by histopathologic examination and cytogenetic abnormalities of bone marrow cells. RESULTS: The patient presented initially with clinical features typical of EV and impairment of cell-mediated immunity. In the skin lesions, HPVs 23 and 25 were identified by nested polymerase chain reaction. Six years later, he had recurrent episodes of mucosal bleeding with fever, weakness, and fatigue. At this time, severe refractory anemia and neutropenia were observed, and bone marrow smears showed hypercellularity with abnormal dysplastic megakaryocytes. The cytogenetic pattern showed abnormalities involving trisomy of chromosomes 8 and 21. The patient received a diagnosis of the indolent subtype of MDS.

In addition to the structural and enzymatic viral gene products, HTLV-1 encodes the positive regulatory proteins Tax and Rex along with viral accessory proteins. Tax and Rex proteins orchestrate the timely expression of viral genes important in viral replication and cellular transformation. Rex is a nucleolar-localizing shuttling protein that acts post-transcriptionally by binding and facilitating the export of the unspliced and incompletely spliced viral mRNAs from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. HTLV-1 Rex (Rex-1) is a phosphoprotein and general protein kinase inhibition correlates with reduced function. Therefore, it has been proposed that Rex-1 function may be regulated through site-specific phosphorylation. RESULTS: We conducted a phosphoryl mapping of Rex-1 over-expressed in transfected 293 T cells using a combination of affinity purification and liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry. We achieved 100% physical coverage of the Rex-1 polypeptide and identified five novel phosphorylation sites at Thr-22, Ser-36, Thr-37, Ser-97, and Ser-106. We also confirmed evidence of two previously identified residues, Ser-70 and Thr-174, but found no evidence of phosphorylation at Ser-177. The functional significance of these phosphorylation events was evaluated using a Rex reporter assay and site-directed mutational analysis. Our results indicate that phosphorylation at Ser-97 and Thr-174 is critical for Rex-1 function. CONCLUSION: We have mapped completely the site-specific phosphorylation of Rex-1 identifying a total of seven residues; Thr-22, Ser-36, Thr-37, Ser-70, Ser-97, Ser-106, and Thr-174. Overall, this work is the first to completely map the phosphorylation sites in Rex-1 and provides important insight into the regulation of Rex-1 function.","['Kesic, Matthew', 'Doueiri, Rami', 'Ward, Michael', 'Semmes, O John', 'Green, Patrick L']","['Kesic M', 'Doueiri R', 'Ward M', 'Semmes OJ', 'Green PL']","['Center for Retrovirus Research, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH 43210, USA. kesic.1@osu.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20091117,England,Retrovirology,Retrovirology,101216893,"['0 (Gene Products, rex)', '0 (rex Protein, Human T-lymphotropic virus 1)', '1114-81-4 (Phosphothreonine)', '17885-08-4 (Phosphoserine)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Cell Line', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Viral', 'Gene Products, rex/chemistry/genetics/isolation & purification/*metabolism', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutation/genetics', 'Phosphorylation', 'Phosphoserine/metabolism', 'Phosphothreonine/metabolism']",2009/11/19 06:00,2010/01/09 06:00,['2009/11/19 06:00'],"['2009/06/22 00:00 [received]', '2009/11/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/11/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/11/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/01/09 06:00 [medline]']","['1742-4690-6-105 [pii]', '10.1186/1742-4690-6-105 [doi]']",epublish,Retrovirology. 2009 Nov 17;6:105. doi: 10.1186/1742-4690-6-105.,6,"['R01 CA076595/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA100730/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,PMC2780990,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We thus explored the relationship between physical activity (PA) and HRQOL among survivors of childhood cancer. METHODS: A total of 215 survivors of childhood lymphoma, leukemia, and central nervous system cancers completed mailed surveys that elicited information regarding leisure-time PA (LTPA) measured in metabolic equivalents, HRQOL, and diagnostic and demographic factors. Correlations and adjusted regression models were used to explore the relationship between LTPA and HRQOL. RESULTS: In the total sample, modest, yet significant linear associations were observed between LTPA and overall HRQOL (beta=0.17, p<0.01), as well as each of the respective subscales (beta=0.11-0.23 and p's<0.05 to <0.001). Among adolescent survivors of childhood cancer, LTPA was significantly associated with overall HRQOL (beta=0.27), cancer worry (beta=0.36), cognitive function (beta=0.32), body appearance (beta=0.29), and social function (beta=0.27) (all p's<0.05). Among adult survivors of childhood cancer, LTPA was only significantly associated with physical function (beta=0.28, p<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Significant associations exist between LTPA and HRQOL; however, the association was stronger and observed in more domains for adolescent survivors of childhood cancer.

It is defined as air filled cysts within the wall of the gastrointestinal tract. The purpose of this paper is the development of an algorithm for the surgical therapy of PCI based one two case reports. CASE PRESENTATIONS: A 17-year-old girl with Down syndrome and leucopenia due to chemotherapy for acute lymphatic leukemia was admitted with acute septic conditions and PCI. Explorative laparotomy revealed acute ischemia of the right colon and resection of the affected intestine was performed. After a short interval in the intensive care unit the patient was referred to the pediatric department. The second patient, a 79 year old man, with urothelial carcinoma and carcinoma of the prostate presented a distended abdomen. CT-scan revealed PCI and adhesive strangulation of intestines. Therefore only adhesiolysis was performed and PCI was treated conservatively. CONCLUSION: Only patients with increased inflammatory parameters in laboratory findings or signs of sepsis, peritonitis or bowel perforation in combination with PCI should receive an explorative laparotomy.","['Schropfer, Engelbert', 'Meyer, Thomas']","['Schropfer E', 'Meyer T']","['Department of General, Visceral, Vascular and Transplant-Surgery, Julius-Maximilians-University of Wurzburg Wurzburg Germany.

Bone marrow and peripheral blood are frequently involved, with central nervous system involvement less common. We describe a case of a 31-year old man diagnosed with a gammadelta HSTCL in 2003, successfully treated with chemotherapy and allogeneic stem cell transplantation, and followed from 2003 to present. Four-color flow cytometry (FC) was performed on a BD FACSCalibur and data analyzed with CellQuest Pro and FCS Express software. For cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), all cells were acquired due to limited material. Cytological correlation was available on all specimens. Molecular studies for T-cell gene rearrangement were non-contributory. By FC, the diagnostic HSTCL immunophenotype was CD3 (+), CD7 (+), CD2 (+), CD5 (-), CD4 (-), CD8 (-), TCR gammadelta (+). Subsequent CSF FC analysis revealed a distinct population of gammadelta T-cells in all specimens, ranging from <1% to 13% of lymphocytes. Consistently, the gammadelta T-cells exhibited a different immunophenotypic profile from the reported diagnostic immunophenotype; they expressed CD5, and exhibited a heterogeneous pattern of CD8 expression. Comparison to in-house cases from patients with hairy cell leukemia and concomitant increases in non-neoplastic gammadelta T-cells was performed. The persistent gammadelta T-cells from the CSF of the patient with HSTCL were immunophenotypically consistent with non-neoplastic gammadelta T-cells. We describe an unusual case of persistent gammadelta T-cells in the CSF of a patient during 6 years of flow cytometric follow-up after treatment for gammadelta HSTCL. By cytology, non-neoplastic and malignant gammadelta T-cells are often difficult to distinguish. FC analysis helps to make this distinction, even with a limited panel. By FC, the gammadelta-T cells in the CSF of this patient are immunophenotypically consistent with non-neoplastic gammadelta T-cells. Remarkably, this finding is underscored by the patient's unusual clinical picture; he remains well and disease free.","['Jiang, Liuyan', 'Abati, Andrea D', 'Wilson, Wyndham', 'Stetler-Stevenson, Maryalice', 'Yuan, Constance']","['Jiang L', 'Abati AD', 'Wilson W', 'Stetler-Stevenson M', 'Yuan C']","['Laboratory of Pathology, Hematopathology Section, Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",20091015,United States,Int J Clin Exp Pathol,International journal of clinical and experimental pathology,101480565,"['0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, gamma-delta)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Biopsy', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Flow Cytometry/*methods', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Liver Neoplasms/immunology/*pathology', 'Lymphoma, T-Cell/cerebrospinal fluid/immunology/*pathology/therapy', 'Male', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, gamma-delta/*analysis', 'Splenic Neoplasms/immunology/*pathology', 'Stem Cell Transplantation', 'T-Lymphocytes/*pathology']",2009/11/18 06:00,2010/03/03 06:00,['2009/11/18 06:00'],"['2009/04/12 00:00 [received]', '2009/07/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/11/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/11/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/03/03 06:00 [medline]']",,epublish,Int J Clin Exp Pathol. 2009 Oct 15;3(1):110-6.,3,,,PMC2776263,,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Gamma-delta T cells', 'T-cell gene rearrangement', 'cerebrospinal fluid', 'flow cytometry', 'hepatosplenic T cell lymphoma']",,,,,,,,,,,

However, increasing evidence suggests that this system has limitations, as acknowledged by the 2008 World Health Organization (WHO) Classification of Tumors of Hematopoietic and Lymphoid Tissues. Although substantially improved in relation to the EGIL, the new WHO Classification is still not optimal for guiding the clinical management of patients with BAL.

Imatinib mesylate is an inhibitor of c-kit and is indicated in the treatment of chronic myeloid leukemia and GISTs. Reported adverse effects of imatinib include hypopigmentation, depigmentation, and hyperpigmentation. Although the exact mechanism by which these occur is unclear, it is likely that inhibition of c-kit leads to downstream inhibition of the tyrosinase gene promoter and thus to inhibition of pigment production. OBSERVATIONS: A 45-year-old woman with a history of multiple dysplastic nevi and lentigines was diagnosed as having familial GIST syndrome. Treatment with imatinib mesylate was started in an attempt to decrease the tumor load. Three months after treatment initiation, the patient noted a decrease in the number of pigmented lesions, lightening of the skin in her genital area, and graying of her terminal hair. CONCLUSIONS: The potential association between a specific genetic mutation and pigmentation changes secondary to imatinib therapy may account for the variety in presentation of this potential side effect. Further genetic studies paired with melanocyte-specific or c-kit-specific stains of affected tissue are warranted to better understand the relationship between the genetic mutation and the effect of imatinib on pigmentation.","['Campbell, Tracy', 'Felsten, Lesley', 'Moore, Julie']","['Campbell T', 'Felsten L', 'Moore J']","['Department of Dermatology, UC Davis Medical Center, 3301 C St, Ste 1300, Sacramento, CA 95816, USA. tmac.2010@yahoo.com']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",,United States,Arch Dermatol,Archives of dermatology,0372433,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*administration & dosage', 'Benzamides', 'Chemotherapy, Adjuvant', 'Colectomy/methods', 'Dysplastic Nevus Syndrome/complications/drug therapy/genetics', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumors/*complications/*drug therapy/genetics/surgery', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Lentigo/*complications/drug therapy/genetics', 'Middle Aged', 'Piperazines/*therapeutic use', 'Pyrimidines/*therapeutic use', 'Risk Assessment', 'Treatment Outcome']",2009/11/18 06:00,2009/12/16 06:00,['2009/11/18 06:00'],"['2009/11/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/11/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2009/12/16 06:00 [medline]']","['145/11/1313 [pii]', '10.1001/archdermatol.2009.263 [doi]']",ppublish,Arch Dermatol. 2009 Nov;145(11):1313-6. doi: 10.1001/archdermatol.2009.263.,145,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We explored the feasibility, safety, and effectiveness of an aggressive immunochemotherapy treatment program that included autologous stem-cell transplantation (ASCT) for patients up to age 69 years with newly diagnosed MCL. PATIENTS AND METHODS The primary end point was 2-year progression-free survival (PFS). A successful trial would yield a 2-year PFS of at least 50% and an event rate (early progression plus nonrelapse mortality) less than 20% at day +100 following ASCT. Seventy-eight patients were treated with two or three cycles of rituximab combined with methotrexate and augmented CHOP (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone). This treatment was followed by intensification with high doses of cytarabine and etoposide combined with rituximab and filgrastim to mobilize autologous peripheral-blood stem cells. Patients then received high doses of carmustine, etoposide, and cyclophosphamide followed by ASCT and two doses of rituximab. Results There were two nonrelapse mortalities, neither during ASCT. With a median follow-up of 4.7 years, the 2-year PFS was 76% (95% CI, 64% to 85%), and the 5-year PFS was 56% (95% CI, 43% to 68%). The 5-year overall survival was 64% (95% CI, 50% to 75%). The event rate by day +100 of ASCT was 5.1%. CONCLUSION The Cancer and Leukemia Group B 59909 regimen is feasible, safe, and effective in patients with newly diagnosed MCL. The incorporation of rituximab with aggressive chemotherapy and ASCT may be responsible for the encouraging outcomes demonstrated in this study, which produced results comparable to similar treatment regimens.","['Damon, Lloyd E', 'Johnson, Jeffrey L', 'Niedzwiecki, Donna', 'Cheson, Bruce D', 'Hurd, David D', 'Bartlett, Nancy L', 'Lacasce, Ann S', 'Blum, Kristie A', 'Byrd, John C', 'Kelly, Michael', 'Stock, Wendy', 'Linker, Charles A', 'Canellos, George P']","['Damon LE', 'Johnson JL', 'Niedzwiecki D', 'Cheson BD', 'Hurd DD', 'Bartlett NL', 'Lacasce AS', 'Blum KA', 'Byrd JC', 'Kelly M', 'Stock W', 'Linker CA', 'Canellos GP']","['University of California Medical Center, The Helen Diller Comprehensive Cancer Center, 400 Parnassus Ave, San Francisco, CA 94143-0324, USA. damonl@medicine.ucsf.edu']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20091116,United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived)', '0 (Immunologic Factors)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '4F4X42SYQ6 (Rituximab)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'PVI5M0M1GW (Filgrastim)', 'VB0R961HZT (Prednisone)', 'CHOP protocol']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/*therapeutic use', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Cyclophosphamide/administration & dosage', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Doxorubicin/administration & dosage', 'Etoposide/administration & dosage', 'Female', 'Filgrastim', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/administration & dosage', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Immunologic Factors/*therapeutic use', 'Immunotherapy/methods', 'Lymphoma, Mantle-Cell/drug therapy/genetics/surgery/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prednisone/administration & dosage', 'Recombinant Proteins', 'Rituximab', 'Survival Rate', 'Transplantation Conditioning', 'Vincristine/administration & dosage']",2009/11/18 06:00,2010/01/22 06:00,['2009/11/18 06:00'],"['2009/11/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/11/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/01/22 06:00 [medline]']","['JCO.2009.22.2554 [pii]', '10.1200/JCO.2009.22.2554 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2009 Dec 20;27(36):6101-8. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2009.22.2554.

Little is known about the incidence and severity of late-occurring neurologic sequelae in ALL survivors. Data were analyzed to determine the incidence of adverse long-term neurologic outcomes and treatment-related risk factors. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We analyzed adverse neurologic outcomes that occurred after diagnosis in 4,151 adult survivors of childhood ALL who participated in the Childhood Cancer Survivor Study (CCSS), a retrospective cohort of 5-year survivors of childhood cancer diagnosed between 1970 and 1986. A randomly selected cohort of the survivors' siblings served as a comparison group. Self-reported auditory-vestibular-visual sensory deficits, focal neurologic dysfunction, seizures, and serious headaches were assessed. RESULTS: The median age at outcome assessment was 20.2 years for survivors. The median follow-up time to death or last survey since ALL diagnosis was 14.1 years. Of the survivors, 64.5% received cranial radiation and 94% received intrathecal chemotherapy. Compared with the sibling cohort, survivors were at elevated risk for late-onset auditory-vestibular-visual sensory deficits (rate ratio [RR], 1.8; 95% CI, 1.5 to 2.2), coordination problems (RR, 4.1; 95% CI, 3.1 to 5.3), motor problems (RR, 5.0; 95% CI, 3.8 to 6.7), seizures (RR, 4.6; 95% CI, 3.4 to 6.2), and headaches (RR, 1.6; 95% CI, 1.4 to 1.7). In multivariable analysis, relapse was the most influential factor that increased risk of late neurologic complications. CONCLUSION: Children treated with regimens that include cranial radiation for ALL and those who suffer a relapse are at increased risk for late-onset neurologic sequelae.","['Goldsby, Robert E', 'Liu, Qi', 'Nathan, Paul C', 'Bowers, Daniel C', 'Yeaton-Massey, Amanda', 'Raber, Shannon H', 'Hill, Daniel', 'Armstrong, Gregory T', 'Yasui, Yutaka', 'Zeltzer, Lonnie', 'Robison, Leslie L', 'Packer, Roger J']","['Goldsby RE', 'Liu Q', 'Nathan PC', 'Bowers DC', 'Yeaton-Massey A', 'Raber SH', 'Hill D', 'Armstrong GT', 'Yasui Y', 'Zeltzer L', 'Robison LL', 'Packer RJ']","['UCSF Pediatric Oncology, 505 Parnassus Ave, Box 0106, San Francisco, CA 94143-0106, USA. goldsbyr@peds.ucsf.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20091116,United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,,IM,"['Adult', 'Ataxia/epidemiology', 'Child', 'Cranial Irradiation/*adverse effects', 'Female', 'Hearing Disorders/epidemiology', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Nervous System Diseases/*epidemiology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*therapy', 'Risk Assessment', 'Siblings', '*Survivors', 'Vision Disorders/epidemiology']",2009/11/18 06:00,2010/01/22 06:00,['2009/11/18 06:00'],"['2009/11/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/11/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/01/22 06:00 [medline]']","['JCO.2009.22.5060 [pii]', '10.1200/JCO.2009.22.5060 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2010 Jan 10;28(2):324-31. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2009.22.5060.

Retinoic acid receptor alpha (RARalpha) is a transcription factor activated by RA, and its serine 77 (RARalphaS77) is the main residue phosphorylated by the cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK)-activating kinase (CAK) complex. We report here that in both human myeloid leukemia and mouse embryonic teratocarcinoma stem cells, either RA-suppressed CAK phosphorylation of RARalpha or mutation of RARalphaS77 to alanine (RARalphaS77A) coordinates CAK-dependent G(1) arrest with cancer cell differentiation by transactivating RA-target genes. Both hypophosphorylated RARalpha and RARalphaS77A reduce binding to retinoic acid-responsive elements (RARE) in the promoters of RA-target genes while stimulating gene transcription. The enhanced transactivation and reduced RARalpha-chromatin interaction are accompanied by RARalpha dissociation from the transcriptional repressor N-CoR and are association with the coactivator NCoA-3. Such effects of decreased CAK phosphorylation of RARalphaS77 on mediating RA-dependent transcriptional control of cancer cell differentiation are examined correspondingly in both RA-resistant myeloid leukemia and embryonic teratocarcinoma stem RARalpha(-/-) cells. These studies demonstrate, for the first time, that RA couples G(1) arrest to transcriptional control of cancer cell differentiation by suppressing CAK phosphorylation of RARalpha to release transcriptional repression.-Wang, A., Alimova, I.

Antibodies specific for CD3, CD20, and CD45/LCA were negative; CD30 or ALK were not assessed. Electron microscopy showed cytoplasmic structures thought to be neurosecretory granules. The neoplasm was interpreted initially as a neuroblastoma. At the time of our review, we considered the possibility of ALCL. Immunohistochemical analysis for CD30 showed bright, uniform expression and ALK was positive in a nuclear and cytoplasmic pattern, confirming the diagnosis of ALK+ ALCL.

A total of 55 adult patients with AML in first complete remission receiving autologous bone marrow-derived stem cell (BMSC) transplantation (BMSCT) were analyzed to determine factors affecting the rate of neutrophil recovery. All patients were treated with standard induction and three to four courses of consolidation chemotherapy and, after collection of BMSC, conditioned with BuCy2. The median time to neutrophil reconstitution was 30 (10-62) days and was delayed in 24 patients. Neutrophil recovery was faster in patients who had received granulocyte-macrophage progenitors (CFU-GM) dose >23.5 x 10(4)/kg, CD34(+) cells >3.2 x 10(6)/kg, and mononuclear cells (MNCs) >3 x 10(8)/kg. The speed of neutrophil recovery correlated with the number of transplanted CFU-GM progenitors (P = .0077) and MNCs (P = .0015). CFU-GM progenitors dose was the only factor close to significance in univariate analysis of neutrophil engraftment. Probability for neutrophil recovery was higher in patients transplanted with a higher dose of MNCs. These data suggested that the content of CFU-GM progenitors and MNCs within the bone marrow graft was the most important factor for the quality of neutrophil recovery after autologous BMSCT in AML patients.","['Kozlowska-Skrzypczak, M', 'Gil, L', 'Komarnicki, M']","['Kozlowska-Skrzypczak M', 'Gil L', 'Komarnicki M']","['Department of Hematology, Poznan University of Medical Sciences, Poznan, Poland.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Transplant Proc,Transplantation proceedings,0243532,['0 (HLA Antigens)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/adverse effects', 'Female', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Progenitor Cells/*transplantation', 'HLA Antigens/immunology', 'Histocompatibility Testing', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/blood/*surgery', 'Macrophages/physiology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neutropenia/*etiology/physiopathology', 'Neutrophils/*physiology', 'Shock, Septic/etiology/mortality', 'Stem Cell Transplantation/*adverse effects', 'Transplantation, Autologous/adverse effects', 'Young Adult']",2009/11/18 06:00,2010/02/25 06:00,['2009/11/18 06:00'],"['2009/05/10 00:00 [received]', '2009/06/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/11/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/11/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/02/25 06:00 [medline]']","['S0041-1345(09)01324-4 [pii]', '10.1016/j.transproceed.2009.06.191 [doi]']",ppublish,Transplant Proc. 2009 Nov;41(9):3868-72. doi: 10.1016/j.transproceed.2009.06.191.,41,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To elucidate these functions, we investigated the influence of a deficiency of LECT2 on the morphology of cultured hippocampal neurons during neuronal development, and examined the expression of neurotrophins (NGF, BDNF, and NT-3) and their receptors (TrkA, TrkB, TrkC, and p75NTR) in these neurons. The extension of axons and dendrites in neurons from LECT2-knockout (LECT2-KO) mice was shorter than that in neurons from wild-type mice during culture and significantly less than that in wild-type mice after 4 days in culture. Moreover, neurons from LECT2-KO mice showed different expression of NGF, BDNF and NT-3 during culture compared to wild-type mice. Our results show that LECT2 regulates the extension of axons and dendrites and the expressions of NGF, BDNF and NT-3 during neuronal development.","['Koshimizu, Yohei', 'Ohtomi, Michiko']","['Koshimizu Y', 'Ohtomi M']","['Department of Biomolecular Science, Graduate School of Science, Toho University, 2-2-1 Miyama, Funabashi, Chiba 274-8510, Japan. y.koshimizu@aist.go.jp']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20091114,Netherlands,Brain Res,Brain research,0045503,"['0 (Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor)', '0 (Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Lect2 protein, mouse)', '0 (Nerve Growth Factors)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Nerve Growth Factor)', '0 (TNFRSF16 protein, mouse)', '0 (neurotropin 3, mouse)', '9061-61-4 (Nerve Growth Factor)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor, trkA)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor, trkB)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor, trkC)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Axons/physiology', 'Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor/*metabolism', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Dendrites/physiology', 'Hippocampus/cytology/physiology', 'Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/deficiency/genetics/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Nerve Growth Factor/*metabolism', 'Nerve Growth Factors/*metabolism', 'Neurites/*physiology', 'Neurons/cytology/*physiology', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Receptor, trkA/metabolism', 'Receptor, trkB/metabolism', 'Receptor, trkC/metabolism', 'Receptors, Nerve Growth Factor/metabolism', 'Time Factors']",2009/11/18 06:00,2010/04/09 06:00,['2009/11/18 06:00'],"['2009/07/14 00:00 [received]', '2009/10/04 00:00 [revised]', '2009/11/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/11/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/11/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/04/09 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-8993(09)02402-0 [pii]', '10.1016/j.brainres.2009.11.010 [doi]']",ppublish,Brain Res. 2010 Jan 22;1311:1-11. doi: 10.1016/j.brainres.2009.11.010.

However, little is known about the expression of miRNAs in microvessels in vivo. Here, we identified candidate microvascular-selective miRNAs by screening public miRNA expression datasets. METHODS: Bioinformatics predictions of microvascular-selective expression were validated with real-time quantitative reverse transcription PCR on purified microvascular fragments from mouse. Pericyte expression was shown with in situ hybridization on tissue sections. Target sites were identified with 3' UTR luciferase assays, and migration was tested in a microfluid chemotaxis chamber. RESULTS: miR-145, miR-126, miR-24, and miR-23a were selectively expressed in microvascular fragments isolated from a range of tissues. In situ hybridization and analysis of Pdgfb retention motif mutant mice demonstrated predominant expression of miR-145 in pericytes. We identified the Ets transcription factor Friend leukemia virus integration 1 (Fli1) as a miR-145 target, and showed that elevated levels of miR-145 reduced migration of microvascular cells in response to growth factor gradients in vitro. CONCLUSIONS: miR-126, miR-24 and miR-23a are selectively expressed in microvascular endothelial cells in vivo, whereas miR-145 is expressed in pericytes. miR-145 targets the hematopoietic transcription factor Fli1 and blocks migration in response to growth factor gradients. Our findings have implications for vascular disease and provide necessary information for future drug design against miRNAs with selective expression in the microvasculature.","['Larsson, Erik', 'Fredlund Fuchs, Peder', 'Heldin, Johan', 'Barkefors, Irmeli', 'Bondjers, Cecilia', 'Genove, Guillem', 'Arrondel, Christelle', 'Gerwins, Par', 'Kurschat, Christine', 'Schermer, Bernhard', 'Benzing, Thomas', 'Harvey, Scott J', 'Kreuger, Johan', 'Lindahl, Per']","['Larsson E', 'Fredlund Fuchs P', 'Heldin J', 'Barkefors I', 'Bondjers C', 'Genove G', 'Arrondel C', 'Gerwins P', 'Kurschat C', 'Schermer B', 'Benzing T', 'Harvey SJ', 'Kreuger J', 'Lindahl P']","['Wallenberg Laboratory for Cardiovascular Research, Bruna Straket 16, Sahlgrenska University Hospital, SE-413 45 Gothenburg, Sweden.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20091116,England,Genome Med,Genome medicine,101475844,,,,2009/11/18 06:00,2009/11/18 06:01,['2009/11/18 06:00'],"['2009/07/03 00:00 [received]', '2009/10/14 00:00 [revised]', '2009/11/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/11/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/11/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2009/11/18 06:01 [medline]']","['gm108 [pii]', '10.1186/gm108 [doi]']",epublish,Genome Med. 2009 Nov 16;1(11):108. doi: 10.1186/gm108.,1,,,PMC2808743,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

MCTx-1 from Millepora, a homolog of DPT, is identified as a cytotoxin towards leukemia cells. The aim of this study was to analyze DPT expression in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) based on the analysis for DPT gene in normal tissues in order to estimate its function in the progression of HCC. DPT mRNA expression was analyzed in normal tissues and HCC cell lines by RT-PCR, and in HCC tissue by RT-PCR and real-time PCR. Its protein was examined in HCC tissues by Western blot and immunohistochemistry assays. Meanwhile, transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1) that is closely associated with HCC and DPT was observed by immunohistochemistry in HCC tissues. The results showed that DPT mRNA was strongly expressed in human fetal and adult liver, kidney, and spleen, weakly in ovary and heart, and absent in other tissues and HCC cell lines examined. Its mRNA was significantly downregulated in HCC tissues, while its protein was weakly expressed in tumor compared with non-tumor. DPT is located mainly in the cytoplasm of several cell types in the liver; it has been identified also in the extracellular matrix of the skin. TGF-beta1 was observed in extensive tumor tissue of HCC. This fact suggests that DPT can play various roles in different tissues and might be a molecule related to carcinogenesis and the progression of HCC via possible interaction with TGF-beta1 and other potential mechanisms.","['Li, Xirong', 'Feng, Ping', 'Ou, Jianfeng', 'Luo, Zhijuan', 'Dai, Ping', 'Wei, Dapeng', 'Zhang, Chongjie']","['Li X', 'Feng P', 'Ou J', 'Luo Z', 'Dai P', 'Wei D', 'Zhang C']","['Department of Immunology, Sichuan University, Chengdu, Sichuan, 610041, China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Biochemistry (Mosc),Biochemistry.

Since oncostatin M (OSM), a member of the IL-6 family, plays an important role in immune and inflammatory responses, we assessed the effect of OSM on hepcidin expression, as well as that of leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), another member of the IL-6 family. We found that hepcidin expression was markedly induced by OSM and LIF in a time- and dose-dependent manner in hepatoma cell lines, and this expression was induced independent of IL-6/IL-6 receptor signaling. Luciferase assay revealed that OSM and LIF stimulated a -1.3-kb hepcidin promoter. This effect was markedly reduced when the signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) site of the promoter was mutated, and was almost completely abolished in the presence of AG-490, a Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitor. Hence, the JAK/STAT pathway plays a major role in OSM- and LIF-induced activation of the hepcidin promoter. In conclusion, we demonstrated that OSM and LIF can induce hepcidin expression mainly through the JAK/STAT pathways. Further studies are warranted to evaluate the clinical significance of OSM and LIF in the development of anemia in various inflammatory diseases.","['Kanda, Junya', 'Uchiyama, Tatsuki', 'Tomosugi, Naohisa', 'Higuchi, Masato', 'Uchiyama, Takashi', 'Kawabata, Hiroshi']","['Kanda J', 'Uchiyama T', 'Tomosugi N', 'Higuchi M', 'Uchiyama T', 'Kawabata H']","['Department of Hematology and Oncology, Graduate School of Medicine, Kyoto University, 54 Shogoin Kawahara-cho, Sakyo-ku, Kyoto, 606-8507, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Graduate School of Medicine, Kyoto University, 54 Shogoin Kawahara-cho, Sakyo-ku, Kyoto, 606-8507, Japan.', 'Proteomics Research Unit, Division of Advanced Medicine, Medical Research Institute, Kanazawa Medical University, Ishikawa, Japan.', 'Proteomics Research Unit, Division of Advanced Medicine, Medical Research Institute, Kanazawa Medical University, Ishikawa, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Graduate School of Medicine, Kyoto University, 54 Shogoin Kawahara-cho, Sakyo-ku, Kyoto, 606-8507, Japan.', 'Kitano Hospital, The Tazuke Kofukai Medical Research Institute, Osaka, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Graduate School of Medicine, Kyoto University, 54 Shogoin Kawahara-cho, Sakyo-ku, Kyoto, 606-8507, Japan. hkawabat@kuhp.kyoto-u.ac.jp.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20091114,Japan,Int J Hematol,International journal of hematology,9111627,"['0 (Antimicrobial Cationic Peptides)', '0 (HAMP protein, human)', '0 (Hepcidins)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '106956-32-5 (Oncostatin M)']",IM,"['Antimicrobial Cationic Peptides/*biosynthesis', 'Carcinoma, Hepatocellular/*pathology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Hepcidins', 'Humans', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/*pharmacology', 'Oncostatin M/*pharmacology']",2009/11/17 06:00,2010/03/20 06:00,['2009/11/17 06:00'],"['2009/09/02 00:00 [received]', '2009/10/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/10/19 00:00 [revised]', '2009/11/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/11/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/03/20 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1007/s12185-009-0443-x [doi]', '10.1007/s12185-009-0443-x [pii]']",ppublish,Int J Hematol. 2009 Dec;90(5):545-552. doi: 10.1007/s12185-009-0443-x.

It has always been a reliable and specific cytochemical marker for hairy cell leukemia and for differentiated cells of monocytic lineage. Only recently has the test for serum TRAP activity been accepted as sensitive and specific enough for clinical use as a marker of osteoclasts and bone resorption. This has come about through steady advances in knowledge about TRAP enzymology, structure, function, and molecular regulation and a consequent appreciation that TRAP isoforms 5a and 5b have very different clinical significance. As a measure of osteoclast number and bone resorption, TRAP 5b has diagnostic and prognostic applications in osteoporosis, cancers with bone metastasis, chronic renal failure, and perhaps other metabolic and pathologic bone diseases. Serum TRAP 5a, on the other hand, has no relationship to bone metabolism but seems instead to be a measure of activated macrophages and chronic inflammation. Exploration of the real clinical usefulness of serum TRAP 5a for diagnosis and disease management in a wide variety of chronic inflammatory diseases is only now beginning. This perspective traces the important basic scientific developments that have led up to the refinement of serum TRAP isoform immunoassays and their validation as biomarkers of disease.

The role of miRNAs in pediatric leukemia still needs to be established. The purpose of this study was to investigate the aberrantly expressed miRNAs in pediatric acute leukemia and demonstrate miRNA patterns that are pediatric-specific and prognostic parameter-associated. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: A total of 111 pediatric bone marrow samples, including 99 patients and 12 normal donors, were enrolled in this study. Of those samples, 36 patients and 7 normal samples were used as a test cohort for the evaluation of miRNA profiling; 63 pediatric patients and 5 normal donors were used as a validation cohort to confirm the miRNA differential expression. Pediatric ALL- and AML-specific microRNA expression patterns were identified in this study. The most highly expressed miRNAs in pediatric ALL were miR-34a, miR-128a, miR-128b, and miR-146a, while the highly expressed miRNAs in pediatric AML were miR-100, miR-125b, miR-335, miR-146a, and miR-99a, which are significantly different from those reported for adult CLL and AML. miR-125b and miR-126 may serve as favorable prognosticators for M3 and M2 patients, respectively. Importantly, we identified a ""miRNA cascade"" associated with central nervous system (CNS) relapse in ALL. Additionally, miRNA patterns associated with prednisone response, specific risk group, and relapse of ALL were also identified. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: There are existing pediatric-associated and prognostic parameter-associated miRNAs that are independent of cell lineage and could provide therapeutic direction for individual risk-adapted therapy for pediatric leukemia patients.","['Zhang, Hua', 'Luo, Xue-Qun', 'Zhang, Peng', 'Huang, Li-Bin', 'Zheng, Yu-Sheng', 'Wu, Jun', 'Zhou, Hui', 'Qu, Liang-Hu', 'Xu, Ling', 'Chen, Yue-Qin']","['Zhang H', 'Luo XQ', 'Zhang P', 'Huang LB', 'Zheng YS', 'Wu J', 'Zhou H', 'Qu LH', 'Xu L', 'Chen YQ']","['Key Laboratory of Gene Engineering of the Ministry of Education, State Key Laboratory for Biocontrol, Sun Yat-Sen University, Guangzhou, PR China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20091113,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,['0 (MicroRNAs)'],IM,"['Central Nervous System Neoplasms/*diagnosis/etiology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cohort Studies', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia/*diagnosis/*pathology', 'Male', '*MicroRNAs', 'Prognosis', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Risk']",2009/11/17 06:00,2010/04/27 06:00,['2009/11/17 06:00'],"['2009/06/30 00:00 [received]', '2009/10/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/11/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/11/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/04/27 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1371/journal.pone.0007826 [doi]'],epublish,PLoS One. 2009 Nov 13;4(11):e7826. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0007826.,4,,,PMC2773830,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We evaluated the permeability of porcine endogenous retroviruses (PERVs) through membrane filters using a pseudotype virus (LacZ(PERV-A)) containing a viral core derived from murine leukemia virus and an envelope (Env) from PERV subgroup A. Contrary to our expectations, LacZ(PERV-A) lost its infectivity by filtration through a 200 nm membrane filter. This unusual phenotype was not observed in pseudotype viruses harboring Envs from other gammaretroviruses. The infectivity of LacZ(PERV-A) was significantly decreased by repeated freeze/thaw treatment, indicating that LacZ(PERV-A) was physically labile. In addition, LacZ(PERV-A) may be agglutinated because copy numbers of viral RNA after filtration were significantly reduced by filtration through the 200 nm membrane.

However, the molecular mechanisms underlying these effects remain poorly characterized. We show here that dexamethasone (Dex)-induced apoptosis in MM.1S and OPM-2 cells is characterized by Bax and Bak conformational changes, DeltaPsi(m) loss, cytochrome c release and caspase-3 activation. Rapamycin, which had minimal cytotoxic effect by itself, strongly potentiated Dex-induced apoptosis. Apoptotic gene expression profiling showed an increase in mRNA levels of Bim in MM.1S cells after Dex treatment and further increases in both cell lines when co-treated with rapamycin. Western blot analysis revealed a moderate increase in Bim protein levels in both MM.1S and OPM-2 cells. Immunoprecipitation experiments revealed that most Bim was complexed to Mcl-1 in untreated cells. Upon treatment with Dex, and specially Dex plus rapamycin, Bim-Mcl-1 complex was disrupted and Bim was found associated to a CHAPS-insoluble fraction. Overexpression of Mcl-1 stabilized Bim-Mcl-1 complexes upon treatment with Dex or Dex+rapamycin and fully prevented apoptosis. Gene silencing of Bim inhibited for the most part Dex-induced apoptosis and, to a large extent, apoptosis induced by Dex plus rapamycin. These results, taken together, indicate that Bim protein is the key mediator of apoptosis induced by Dex and also responsible for the potentiating effect of rapamycin, providing molecular criteria for the use of glucocorticoids combined with mTOR inhibitors in myeloma therapy.","['Lopez-Royuela, Nuria', 'Balsas, Patricia', 'Galan-Malo, Patricia', 'Anel, Alberto', 'Marzo, Isabel', 'Naval, Javier']","['Lopez-Royuela N', 'Balsas P', 'Galan-Malo P', 'Anel A', 'Marzo I', 'Naval J']","['Department Bioquimica y Biologia Molecular y Celular, Universidad de Zaragoza, 50009 Zaragoza, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20091113,Netherlands,Biochim Biophys Acta,Biochimica et biophysica acta,0217513,"['0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (BBC3 protein, human)', '0 (BCL2L11 protein, human)', '0 (Bcl-2-Like Protein 11)', '0 (Glucocorticoids)', '0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', 'EC 2.7.1.1 (MTOR protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'W36ZG6FT64 (Sirolimus)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Bcl-2-Like Protein 11', 'Cell Line, Tumor/*drug effects', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Glucocorticoids/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Membrane Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Multiple Myeloma/drug therapy/*metabolism', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/genetics/metabolism', 'RNA Interference', 'Sirolimus/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases']",2009/11/17 06:00,2010/05/18 06:00,['2009/11/17 06:00'],"['2009/07/31 00:00 [received]', '2009/10/20 00:00 [revised]', '2009/11/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/11/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/11/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/05/18 06:00 [medline]']","['S0167-4889(09)00271-7 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bbamcr.2009.11.004 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochim Biophys Acta. 2010 Feb;1803(2):311-22. doi: 10.1016/j.bbamcr.2009.11.004.

These studies have each been updated and the cases will be pooled to derive a more powerful study. The benzene exposure of new leukemia cases and controls was estimated in accordance with each respective study's original methods. An essential component of the process of pooling the data was comparison and rationalisation of the exposure estimates to ensure accuracy and consistency of approach. This paper describes this process and presents comparative estimates before and after appropriate revision took place. The original petroleum industry studies, in Canada, the UK and Australia, were conducted at different points in time by different study teams, but the industry used similar technology in similar eras in each of these countries. METHODS: A job history for each subject giving job title, dates of starting and leaving the job and location of work, was assembled. For each job or task, the average benzene exposure (Base Estimate (BE) in ppm) was derived from measurements collected at applicable worksites. Estimates of exposure intensity (workplace exposure estimates (WE)) were then calculated for each line of work history by adjusting the BEs for site- and era-specific exposure-related variables such as loading technology and percentage benzene in the product. To ensure that the exposure estimates were comparable among the studies, the WEs were allocated to generic Job Categories, e.g. Tanker Driver (by technology used e.g. bottom loading), Motor Mechanic. The WEs were stratified into eras, reflecting technological changes in the industry. The arithmetic mean (AM), geometric mean (GM) and range of the stratified WEs were calculated, by study, for each generic Job Category. These were then compared. The AMs of the WEs were regarded as substantially similar if they were within 20% in all three studies in one era or for at least two studies in two eras. If the AM of the WE group differed by more than 20%, the data were examined to see whether the difference was justified by differences in local exposure conditions, such as an enclosure versus open work area. Estimates were adjusted in the absence of justification for the difference. RESULTS: Reconciliation of differences resulted in changes to a small number of underlying BEs, particularly the background values, also the BEs attributed to some individuals and changes to the allocation of jobs between Job Categories. Although the studies covered some differing sectors of the industry and different time periods, for 22 Job Categories there was sufficient overlap, particularly in the downstream distribution sector, to make comparisons possible. After adjustment 12 Job Categories were judged to be similar and 10 were judged to be justifiably different. Job-based peak and skin exposure estimates were applied in a uniform way across the studies and a single approach to scoring the certainty of the exposure estimates was identified. CONCLUSIONS: The revised exposure estimates will be used in the pooled analysis to examine the risk of haematopoietic cancers and benzene exposure. This exercise provided an important quality control check on the exposure estimates and identified similarly exposed Job Categories that could be grouped for risk assessment analyses.","['Glass, D C', 'Armstrong, T W', 'Pearlman, E D', 'Verma, D K', 'Schnatter, A R', 'Rushton, L']","['Glass DC', 'Armstrong TW', 'Pearlman ED', 'Verma DK', 'Schnatter AR', 'Rushton L']","['Department of Epidemiology & Preventive Medicine, School of Public Health and Preventive Medicine, Monash University, The Alfred Hospital, Melbourne, Monash Centre for Occupational and Environmental Health, VIC 3004, Australia. deborah.glass@med.monash.edu.au']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20091113,Ireland,Chem Biol Interact,Chemico-biological interactions,0227276,"['0 (Petroleum)', 'J64922108F (Benzene)']",IM,"['Benzene/adverse effects/*analysis', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cohort Studies', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/chemically induced/*epidemiology', 'Occupational Exposure/adverse effects/*analysis', 'Petroleum/adverse effects', 'Risk Assessment']",2009/11/17 06:00,2010/04/24 06:00,['2009/11/17 06:00'],"['2009/09/16 00:00 [received]', '2009/10/30 00:00 [revised]', '2009/11/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/11/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/11/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/04/24 06:00 [medline]']","['S0009-2797(09)00474-8 [pii]', '10.1016/j.cbi.2009.11.003 [doi]']",ppublish,Chem Biol Interact. 2010 Mar 19;184(1-2):101-11. doi: 10.1016/j.cbi.2009.11.003.

In order to clarify their role in retroviral replication, we analyzed the effect of pharmacological inhibitors and of a dominant-negative version of ATR on the replication of retroviruses in cell lines relevant to HIV-1 infection.

SiRNA-mediated inhibition of NP-1 expression correlated with significant reduction of HTLV-1 Env-mediated fusion. The vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF(165)) caused downmodulation of surface NP-1 and inhibited HTLV-1 infection of U87 cells. In contrast, VEGF(165) partially inhibited infection of primary astrocytes and had no significant effect on infection of HeLa cells. VEGF(165) and antibodies to the glucose transporter protein 1 (anti-GLUT-1) were both needed to block infection of primary astrocytes, however, only anti-GLUT-1 antibodies were sufficient to block infection of HeLa cells.

Previously we had reported antiproliferative activity of the venom of Indian black scorpion, Heterometrus bengalensis Koch. Here we have isolated and purified a novel protein named Bengalin (72kDa) from the venom, responsible for antiproliferative and apoptogenic activities against human leukemic cells U937 (histiocytic lymphoma) and K562 (chronic myelogenous leukemia). N-terminal sequence of first 20 amino acids of Bengalin was G-P-L-T-I-L-H-I-N-D-V-H-A-A/R-F-E-Q/G-F/G-N-T. Bengalin induced cell growth inhibition at IC(50) values of 3.7 and 4.1 microg/ml for U937 and K562 cells respectively did not significantly affect normal human lymphocytes. Inhibition of U937 and K562 cell proliferation occurred by apoptosis as evidenced from damaged nuclei, cell cycle arrest at sub G1 phase, increase of early apoptotic cells, augmentation of DNA fragmentation and also a reduction of telomerase activity. Further insights revealed that Bax:Bcl2 ratio was elevated after Bengalin treatment. Moreover Bengalin elicited loss of mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) which commenced cytochrome c release in cytosol, decreased heat shock protein (HSP) 70 and 90 expression, activated caspase-9, caspase-3 and induced poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) cleavage. We have also determined that HSP70 and 90 inhibitions correlated with Bengalin induced antiproliferation, caspase-3 upregulation, apoptogenesis and increased DNA fragmentation. These results hypothesize that Bengalin might provide a putative molecular mechanism for their anticancer effect on human leukemic cells which might be mediated by mitochondrial death cascade. Inhibition of HSPs might also play a crucial role in induction of apoptosis.","['Gupta, Shubho Das', 'Gomes, Antony', 'Debnath, Anindita', 'Saha, Archita', 'Gomes, Aparna']","['Gupta SD', 'Gomes A', 'Debnath A', 'Saha A', 'Gomes A']","['Drug Development Division, Indian Institute of Chemical Biology, 4, Raja S.C.

Symptoms are often vague or insidious; they may suggest a more common alternative diagnosis, and they are quite different from those associated with adult malignancy. The skilled office practitioner must consider cancer as a diagnosis when symptoms/signs persist or when multiple symptoms point toward a possible diagnosis of malignancy. Early diagnosis is critical, as survival rates have increased dramatically over the past decades. Prolonged delay in diagnosis is common, especially for brain tumors and certain lymphomas (Hodgkin disease). When one encounters symptoms suspicious for a childhood malignancy, it is imperative that the child be referred to a pediatric cancer center. These centers possess not only the ability to further evaluate and manage children with malignancy, but also are able to provide support for patients and their families. This evaluation may include further imaging, but often involves obtaining tissue for histologic review. This will require appropriate tumor or bone marrow biopsy, preferably before the start of treatment. Depending upon the type of suspected malignancy, direct tumor biopsy can be facilitated by imaging-guided biopsy (ultrasound, CT, or MRI), which spares the patient additional surgery. This optimally is performed by a skilled team: hematologist/oncologist, surgeon, radiologist, and pathologist. Best results depend upon early referral by the thoughtful practitioner.","['Raab, Christopher P', 'Gartner, J Carlton Jr']","['Raab CP', 'Gartner JC Jr']","['Department of Pediatrics, Thomas Jefferson University, Philadelphia, PA, USA. craab@nemours.org']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,Prim Care,Primary care,0430463,,IM,"['Bone Neoplasms/diagnosis', 'Central Nervous System Neoplasms/diagnosis', 'Child', 'Child Welfare', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice', 'Humans', 'Kidney Neoplasms/diagnosis', 'Leukemia/diagnosis', 'Lymphoma/diagnosis', 'Neoplasms/*diagnosis/therapy', 'Neoplasms, Muscle Tissue/diagnosis', 'Neuroblastoma/diagnosis', 'Physical Examination/*methods', ""Practice Patterns, Physicians'/*organization & administration"", 'Primary Health Care/*organization & administration', 'United States', 'Wilms Tumor/diagnosis']",2009/11/17 06:00,2010/02/02 06:00,['2009/11/17 06:00'],"['2009/11/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/11/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/02/02 06:00 [medline]']","['S0095-4543(09)00068-2 [pii]', '10.1016/j.pop.2009.07.002 [doi]']",ppublish,Prim Care. 2009 Dec;36(4):671-84. doi: 10.1016/j.pop.2009.07.002.,36,,,,,33,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Tight regulation of cell survival in neuronal precursor is essential during neurogenesis in both developing and adult brain. Increasing data show that diverse external factors including LPA play roles in controlling cell survival and apoptosis in early developing neurons. However, the underlying control mechanism remains unclear. To explore how LPA regulates cell survival or apoptosis in a developing neuron, mechanisms for cell survival and signaling cascades by LPA were investigated in H19-7 hippocampal progenitor cells. Here, we showed that LPA promotes cell survival by protection from apoptosis. Mcl-1 was demonstrated to be crucial in LPA-induced cell survival by transfection of the siRNA specific for Mcl-1 and overexpression of Mcl-1. LPA-induced cell survival was critically mediated by the upregulation of Mcl-1 which was regulated not only through a post-translational control but a transcriptional control. Mcl-1 stabilization by LPA-induced inhibitory phosphorylation of GSK-3 contributed predominantly to the Mcl-1 upregulation. Both LPA-induced cell survival and the GSK-3 phosphorylation were attenuated by PTX and by siRNA specific for LPA1 or LPA2 receptor. Taken together, these results showed that Mcl-1 stabilization by inhibitory phosphorylation of GSK-3 through Gi/o coupling of the LPA1 and LPA2 receptors following Mcl-1 upregulation plays a critical role in LPA-induced survival of H19-7 cells. In developing neurons, modulation of Mcl-1 levels may constitute a crucial mechanism for controlling their fates.","['Sun, Yuanjie', 'Nam, Ju-Suk', 'Han, Dong-Hoon', 'Kim, Nam-Ho', 'Choi, Ho-Kyew', 'Lee, Jeong Kug', 'Rhee, Hae Jin', 'Huh, Sung-Oh']","['Sun Y', 'Nam JS', 'Han DH', 'Kim NH', 'Choi HK', 'Lee JK', 'Rhee HJ', 'Huh SO']","['Institute of Natural Medicine, Department of Pharmacology, College of Medicine, Hallym University, Chunchon, Kangwon-do 200-702, South Korea.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Cell Signal,Cellular signalling,8904683,"['0 (Lysophospholipids)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (RNA, Small Cytoplasmic)', '0 (Receptors, Lysophosphatidic Acid)', 'EC 2.4.2.31 (Pertussis Toxin)', 'EC 2.7.11.26 (Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3)', 'PG6M3969SG (lysophosphatidic acid)']",IM,"['Animals', '*Apoptosis', 'Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3/metabolism', 'Lysophospholipids/*pharmacology', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Neurons/*metabolism', 'Pertussis Toxin/*pharmacology', 'Phosphorylation', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*metabolism/physiology', 'RNA, Small Cytoplasmic/metabolism', 'Rats', 'Receptors, Lysophosphatidic Acid/genetics/metabolism', 'Stem Cells/*metabolism', 'Up-Regulation']",2009/11/17 06:00,2010/03/10 06:00,['2009/11/17 06:00'],"['2009/09/25 00:00 [received]', '2009/10/29 00:00 [revised]', '2009/11/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/11/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/11/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/03/10 06:00 [medline]']","['S0898-6568(09)00337-4 [pii]', '10.1016/j.cellsig.2009.11.002 [doi]']",ppublish,Cell Signal. 2010 Mar;22(3):484-94. doi: 10.1016/j.cellsig.2009.11.002.,22,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This has established the molecular foundation of ATO plus ATRA therapy. Currently, ATO plus ATRA has also been widely used in clinical practice. OBJECTIVE: To assess the efficacy and safety of ATO in combination with ATRA for APL. SEARCH STRATEGY: The Cochrane Library (Issue 1, 2009), Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (from 1970 to January 2009), MEDLINE (from 1978 to October 2008), EMBASE (from 1950 to March 2009), Chinese Biological Medical Literature Database (from 1978 to December 2008), CNKI (from 1994 to December 2008), China Medical Academic Conference Database (from 1994 to December 2008) were electronically searched. We also searched the Meta-Register of Controlled Trials, Conference Proceedings of American Society of Hematology (from 1946 to December 2008) and Conference Proceedings of American Society of Clinical Oncology (from 1946 to December 2008) on the internet for grey literature. The authors also hand-searched Chinese periodicals potentially related to the question including Chinese Journal of Hematology, Journal of Experimental Hematology and Journal of Clinical Hematology. INCLUSION CRITERIA: All randomized controlled trials comparing ATO plus ATRA with other regimens for the treatment of APL were included. Intervention and comparison regimens include: 1) ATO plus ATRA vs ATO monotherapy; 2) ATO plus ATRA vs ATRA monotherapy; 3) ATO plus ATRA vs ATRA plus chemotherapy; 4) ATO plus ATRA vs ATO+ATRA+chemotherapy. DATA EXTRACTION AND ANALYSIS: Related data concerning complete remission rate, overall survival rate, and disease free survival rate, time to complete remission, relapse rate, mortality and adverse reactions were extracted independently by two reviewers. The different statistical methods were applied according to different data type with RevMan 5.0 software. RESULTS: After merging of the included trials, seven eligible randomized controlled trials with 392 cases were analyzed, among which 6 RCTs were methodologically graded as middle and one as of high risk of bias. The control therapies included ATO monotherapy, ATRA monotherapy and chemotherapy with ATO plus ATRA. Compared with ATO monotherapy, ATO plus ATRA could improve time to complete remission and relapse rate of newly diagnosed APL, but could not improve the complete remission rate, disease free survival rate, mortality and liver dysfunction of relapsed APL patients based on meta-analysis and sensitivity analysis. Compared with ATRA monotherapy, ATO plus ATRA shortened the time to complete remission, improved the disease free survival rate and relapse rate, but increased the incidence of edema during the treatment. Compared with chemotherapy with ATO plus ATRA, ATO plus ATRA could improve the complete remission rate, relapse rate, mortality and adverse reactions. CONCLUSION: For newly diagnosed APL, ATO plus ATRA is superior to ATO monotherapy, ATRA monotherapy and chemotherapy with ATO plus ATRA, but due to the lack of data about comparison with the current standard treatment regimen (ATRA plus chemotherapy), it is not enough to recommend ATO plus ATRA as a frontline therapy. For relapsed APL, ATO plus ATRA is not superior to ATO monotherapy, and ATRA plus ATO is not a supportive therapy. Due to limitation of sample size and risk of bias from the included trials, the effects of ATO plus ATRA need to be confirmed by large and high-quality randomized controlled trials.","['Xu, Shuang-nian', 'Chen, Jie-ping', 'Liu, Jian-ping', 'Xia, Yun']","['Xu SN', 'Chen JP', 'Liu JP', 'Xia Y']","['Center for Hematology, Southwest Hospital, Third Military Medical University, Chongqing 400038, China.']",['chi'],"['Journal Article', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Review', 'Systematic Review']",,China,Zhong Xi Yi Jie He Xue Bao,Zhong xi yi jie he xue bao = Journal of Chinese integrative medicine,101199657,"['0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (Oxides)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*drug therapy', 'Oxides/*therapeutic use', 'Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic', 'Survival Analysis', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Tretinoin/*therapeutic use']",2009/11/17 06:00,2013/01/15 06:00,['2009/11/17 06:00'],"['2009/11/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/11/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/01/15 06:00 [medline]']","['jcim20091102 [pii]', '10.3736/jcim20091102 [doi]']",ppublish,Zhong Xi Yi Jie He Xue Bao. 2009 Nov;7(11):1024-34. doi: 10.3736/jcim20091102.,7,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The chemotherapeutics camptothecin, a plant alkaloid topoisomerase I inhibitor, was tested side-by-side with khat in a panel of acute myeloid leukemia cell lines to elucidate mechanisms of toxicity. RESULTS: Khat had a profound effect on MOLM-13 cells inducing mitochondrial damage, chromatin margination and morphological features of autophagy. The effects of khat on mitochondrial ultrastructure in MOLM-13 correlated with strongly impaired routine respiration, an effect neither found in the khat-resistant MV-4-11 cells nor in camptothecin treated cells. Enforced expression of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 protein provided protection against camptothecin-induced cell death and partly against khat toxicity. Khat-induced cell death in MOLM-13 cells included reduced levels of anti-apoptotic Mcl-1 protein, while both khat and camptothecin induced c-FLIPL cleavage and procaspase-8 activation. CONCLUSION: Khat activated a distinct cell death pathway in sensitive leukemic cells as compared to camptothecin, involving mitochondrial damage and morphological features of autophagy.

Here, we present unprecedented experimental evidence that polo-like kinase 1 (PLK1) is the upstream regulator of SYK in B-lineage acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) cells. Selective inhibition of PLK-1 with the leflunomide metabolite analogue alpha-cyano-beta-hydroxy-beta-methyl-N-[4-(trifluoromethoxy) phenyl]-propenamide/LFM-A12 abolished the resistance of B-lineage ALL cells to OS by preventing the activation of the anti-apoptotic SYK signal transduction pathway. Notably, LFM-A12 treatments at non-cytotoxic concentrations resulted in marked augmentation of clonogenic death in resistant human B-lineage ALL cell lines challenged with OS. Further, LFM-A12 augmented OS-induced apoptosis of chemotherapy-resistant primary leukaemic cells from relapsed B-lineage ALL patients in vitro and markedly potentiated the in vivo anti-leukaemic activity of total body irradiation (TBI) against leukaemia-initiating cells in severe combined immunodeficient mouse xenograft models of B-lineage ALL.

The GIT-PIX protein complexes are involved in the regulation of cell motility and adhesion and in the endocytic traffic of members of the family of G-protein-coupled receptors. We have investigated the function of the endogenous GIT complexes in the regulation of cell motility stimulated by fMLP (formyl-Met-Leu-Phe) peptide, in a rat basophilic leukaemia RBL-2H3 cell line stably expressing an HA (haemagglutinin)-tagged receptor for the fMLP peptide. RESULTS: Our analysis shows that RBL cells stably transfected with the chemoattractant receptor expressed both GIT1-PIX and GIT2-PIX endogenous complexes. We have used silencing of the different members of the complex by small interfering RNAs to study the effects on a number of events linked to agonist-induced cell migration. We found that cell adhesion was not affected by depletion of any of the proteins of the GIT complex, whereas agonist-enhanced cell spreading was inhibited. Analysis of agonist-stimulated haptotactic cell migration indicated a specific positive effect of GIT1 depletion on trans-well migration. The internalization of the formyl-peptide receptor was also inhibited by depletion of GIT1 and GIT2. The effects of the GIT complexes on trafficking of the receptors was confirmed by an antibody-enhanced agonist-induced internalization assay, showing that depletion of PIX, GIT1 or GIT2 protein caused decreased perinuclear accumulation of internalized receptors. CONCLUSIONS: Our results show that endogenous GIT complexes are involved in the regulation of chemoattractant-induced cell motility and receptor trafficking, and support previous findings indicating an important function of the GIT complexes in the regulation of different G-protein-coupled receptors. Our results also indicate that endogenous GIT1 and GIT2 regulate distinct subsets of agonist-induced responses and suggest a possible functional link between the control of receptor trafficking and the regulation of cell motility by GIT proteins.","['Gavina, Manuela', 'Za, Lorena', 'Molteni, Raffaella', 'Pardi, Ruggero', 'de Curtis, Ivan']","['Gavina M', 'Za L', 'Molteni R', 'Pardi R', 'de Curtis I']","['Unit of Cell Adhesion, Division of Neuroscience, San Raffaele University and San Raffaele Scientific Institute, 20132 Milano, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20100114,England,Biol Cell,Biology of the cell,8108529,"['0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (GTPase-Activating Proteins)', '0 (Git1 protein, rat)', '0 (Git2 protein, rat)', '0 (Phosphoproteins)', '59880-97-6 (N-Formylmethionine Leucyl-Phenylalanine)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (p21-Activated Kinases)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Basophils/cytology', 'Calcium/metabolism', 'Cell Adhesion', 'Cell Cycle Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', '*Cell Movement', 'Chemotaxis', 'Down-Regulation', 'GTPase-Activating Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'N-Formylmethionine Leucyl-Phenylalanine/*metabolism', 'Phosphoproteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Rats', 'p21-Activated Kinases/genetics/*metabolism']",2009/11/17 06:00,2010/05/11 06:00,['2009/11/17 06:00'],"['2009/11/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/11/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/05/11 06:00 [medline]']","['BC20090074 [pii]', '10.1042/BC20090074 [doi]']",epublish,Biol Cell. 2010 Jan 14;102(4):231-44. doi: 10.1042/BC20090074.,102,,,PMC2825732,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The disease is characterized by proliferation and accumulation of small CD5+ B cells in blood, lymph nodes, spleen, liver and bone marrow. The natural clinical course of CLL is highly variable, and chemotherapy is usually not indicated in early and stable disease. However, patients with progressive and more advanced CLL require treatment. For many years, chlorambucil with or without corticosteroids was used in previously untreated patients with CLL. More recently, purine nucleoside analogues (PNAs) [fludarabine, cladribine and pentostatin] have been included in treatment approaches for this disease, and chlorambucil is no longer the leading standard everywhere. Currently, this drug is rather recommended for the treatment of older, unfit patients with co-morbidities, especially in European countries. Significantly higher overall response (OR) and complete response (CR) rates in patients treated initially with PNAs than in those treated with chlorambucil or cyclophosphamide-based combination regimens have been confirmed in randomized, prospective, multicentre trials. Moreover, PNAs administered in combination with cyclophosphamide produce higher response rates, including CR and molecular CR, compared with PNA as monotherapy. Recent reports suggest that the administration of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) can significantly improve the course of CLL. At present, two mAbs have the most important clinical value in patients with CLL. The first is rituximab, a human mouse antibody that targets CD20 antigens, and the second is alemtuzumab, a humanized form of a rat antibody active against CD52. Several recent reports suggest that in patients with CLL, rituximab combined with a PNA can increase the OR and CR rates compared with PNA or rituximab alone, with acceptable toxicity. In randomized trials, the combination of rituximab with fludarabine and cyclophosphamide (FC-R regimen) demonstrated higher rates of OR, CR and progression-free survival in patients with previously untreated and relapsed or refractory CLL than fludarabine plus cyclophosphamide (FC regimen). Several reports have confirmed significant activity with alemtuzumab in relapsed or refractory CLL, as well as in previously untreated patients. Recently, several new agents have been investigated and have shown promise in treating patients with CLL. These treatments include new mAbs, agents targeting the antiapoptotic bcl-2 family of proteins and receptors involved in mediating survival signals from the microenvironment, antisense oligonucleotides and other agents. The most promising are new mAbs directed against the CD20 molecule, lumiliximab and anti-CD40 mAbs. Oblimersen, alvocidib (flavopiridol) and lenalidomide are also being evaluated both in preclinical studies and in early clinical trials. In recent years, a significant improvement in haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) procedures in patients with high-risk CLL has been observed. However, the exact role of HSCT, autologous or allogeneic, in the standard management of CLL patients is still undefined.","['Robak, Tadeusz', 'Jamroziak, Krzysztof', 'Robak, Pawel']","['Robak T', 'Jamroziak K', 'Robak P']","['Department of Hematology, Medical University of Lode, Copernicus Memorial Hospital, Lodz, Poland. robaktad@csk.umed.lodz.pl']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,New Zealand,Drugs,Drugs,7600076,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized)', '0 (Antibodies, Neoplasm)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '3A189DH42V (Alemtuzumab)', '8Z13S29R5A (lumiliximab)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Alemtuzumab', 'Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/*immunology/*therapeutic use', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized', 'Antibodies, Neoplasm/*immunology/therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Agents/immunology/*therapeutic use', 'Disease Models, Animal', '*Disease-Free Survival', 'Europe', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell', 'Male', 'Mice', 'North America', 'Rats']",2009/11/17 06:00,2010/04/28 06:00,['2009/11/17 06:00'],"['2009/11/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/11/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/04/28 06:00 [medline]']","['4 [pii]', '10.2165/11319270-000000000-00000 [doi]']",ppublish,Drugs. 2009;69(17):2415-49. doi: 10.2165/11319270-000000000-00000.,69,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Reverse genetics strategies based on the targeted disruption of miRNAs offer a powerful tool to study miRNA functions in mammalian hematopoiesis. The miR-144/451 cluster comprises two miRNAs coexpressed from a common precursor transcript in an erythroid-specific manner. To decipher the contribution of each miRNA of the cluster in mammalian erythropoiesis, we developed a strategy for stable in vivo individual and combinatorial miRNA inhibition. We developed decoy target sequences for each miRNA expressed by lentiviral vectors marked with distinct fluorescent proteins and used them to probe the functions of miR-144 and miR-451 in the murine hematopoietic system in a competitive repopulation setting. Murine hematopoietic chimeras expressing lentiviral-encoded inhibitory sequences specific for miR-144 or miR-451 exhibited markedly reduced Ter119(+) erythroblast counts, with the combined knockdown showing additive effect. These chimeras showed abnormal patterns of erythroid differentiation primarily affecting the proerythroblast to basophilic erythroblast transition, coinciding with the stage where expression of the miRNA cluster is dramatically induced and posttranscriptional gene regulation becomes prominent. These results reveal a role for the miR-144/451 locus in mammalian erythropoiesis and provide the first evidence of functional cooperativity between clustered miRNAs in the hematopoietic system.

Populations of CLL cells are heterogeneous and consist primarily of quiescent cells with a minor subset of dividing cells. In this study the efficacy of a first-line in vivo therapy was compared with treatment by R-roscovitine (ROSC) alone or by purine analogues (cladribine and fludarabine) combined with maphosphamide for 14 CLL patients under ex vivo conditions. ROSC induced the highest reduction in numbers of living B-cells, coinciding with an increased rate of apoptosis. After 24 h the percentage of apoptotic cells in ROSC-treated cultures was markedly higher than in untreated controls. ROSC also induced strong activation of the apoptosome and effector caspases in CLL cells. During progression of apoptosis the plasma membrane became permeable, resulting in the release of activated caspases into the culture medium. Leukemic cells were more sensitive to ROSC than normal mononuclear cells. Treatment with ROSC did not affect the activating phosphorylation of CDK2 or CDK1. However, ROSC decreased phosphorylation of survivin, CDK7, and RNA-Pol II, resulting in inhibition of transcription elongation and subsequent down-regulation of levels of anti-apoptotic factors, thereby facilitating apoptosis. Unlike ROSC, two other purine analogues barely affected the cellular levels of anti-apoptotic proteins and more weakly activated effector caspases. In addition, the efficacies of in vivo and ex vivo therapies were found to be correlated. Marked between-patient differences in expression patterns of apoptosis-regulating factors in CLL cells were observed, explaining the variations in patients' sensitivity to therapy.","['Rogalinska, Malgorzata', 'Blonski, Jerzy Z', 'Komina, Oxana', 'Goralski, Pawel', 'Zolnierczyk, Jolanta D', 'Piekarski, Henryk', 'Robak, Tadeusz', 'Kilianska, Zofia M', 'Wesierska-Gadek, Jozefa']","['Rogalinska M', 'Blonski JZ', 'Komina O', 'Goralski P', 'Zolnierczyk JD', 'Piekarski H', 'Robak T', 'Kilianska ZM', 'Wesierska-Gadek J']","['Department of Cytobiochemisty, University of Lodz, Lodz, Poland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,J Cell Biochem,Journal of cellular biochemistry,8205768,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Purines)', '0ES1C2KQ94 (Roscovitine)', '47M74X9YT5 (Cladribine)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (cyclin-dependent kinase-activating kinase)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'P2K93U8740 (fludarabine)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects/physiology', 'Caspases/drug effects/metabolism', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cladribine/administration & dosage', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinases/*metabolism', 'Cyclophosphamide/administration & dosage', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunoblotting', '*Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Purines/*pharmacology', 'Roscovitine', 'Vidarabine/administration & dosage/analogs & derivatives']",2009/11/17 06:00,2010/03/03 06:00,['2009/11/14 06:00'],"['2009/11/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/11/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/03/03 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/jcb.22400 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cell Biochem. 2010 Jan 1;109(1):217-35. doi: 10.1002/jcb.22400.,109,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

SAHA induced dose-dependent and cell type-dependent cell death which displayed apoptotic features (caspase-3 activation and apoptotic DNA fragmentation) in most cell types including the normal lymphocytes. At subtoxic concentrations (0.5-1 microM), SAHA increased the cell adhesivity to fibronectin (FN) in all leukemia/lymphoma-derived cell lines but not in normal lymphocytes. This increase was accompanied by an enhanced expression of integrin beta1 and paxillin, an essential constituent of focal adhesion complexes, both at the protein and mRNA level. On the other hand, the inhibition of ROCK protein, an important regulator of cytoskeleton structure, had no consistent effect on SAHA-induced increase in the cell adhesivity.

However, there has been no evaluation of whether GJIC in BMSCs in complete remission (CR) post-chemotherapy is different from GJIC pre-chemotherapy. We studied Cx43 expression and tested GJIC function in human bone marrow cultures under different physiological and pathological conditions. To assay Cx43 expression we used immunocytochemistry, laser scan confocal microscopy (LSCM), flow cytometry and RT-PCR. The results showed that the expression level of Cx43 and its mRNA in acute leukemia BMSCs post-chemotherapy was significantly higher and similar to normal levels than in primary acute leukemia BMSCs (p<0.01). Functional tests in cultures using dye transfer and fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) assays showed that the function of GJIC in acute leukemia BMSCs was significantly improved following effective chemotherapy. Our findings suggest Cx43 and GJIC might be involved in the courses of occurrence, development and termination of acute leukemia, and effective chemotherapy could improve Cx43 expression and GJIC function that were dysfunctional prior to treatment.","['Liu, Yao', 'Zhang, Xi', 'Li, Zhong-jun', 'Chen, Xing-hua']","['Liu Y', 'Zhang X', 'Li ZJ', 'Chen XH']","['Department of Hematology, Xinqiao Hospital, The Third Military Medical University, Shapingba District, Xinqiao Street, Chongqing 400037, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20091112,England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Connexin 43)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Bone Marrow Cells/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Cell Communication/drug effects/physiology', 'Cell Separation', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Connexin 43/*biosynthesis/drug effects', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Gap Junctions/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Male', 'Microscopy, Confocal', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/*metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Stromal Cells/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Up-Regulation']",2009/11/17 06:00,2010/04/24 06:00,['2009/11/14 06:00'],"['2009/06/26 00:00 [received]', '2009/09/10 00:00 [revised]', '2009/10/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/11/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/11/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/04/24 06:00 [medline]']","['S0145-2126(09)00506-2 [pii]', '10.1016/j.leukres.2009.10.013 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 2010 May;34(5):631-40. doi: 10.1016/j.leukres.2009.10.013.

Altering the dasatinib regimen from 70 mg twice daily to 100 mg daily reduces the risk of pleural effusion for patients taking dasatinib. Should pleural effusion develop, dasatinib should be interrupted until the condition resolves. Patients with a history of pleural effusion risk factors should be monitored closely while taking dasatinib. Patients receiving imatinib and nilotinib are not without risk of fluid retention.

We studied genetic changes occurring over time in cancers presenting with a relatively simple karyotype, namely two related core-binding factor (CBF) acute myeloid leukemias (AMLs), to assess how specific chromosomal changes are selected based on tumor subtype and acquired somatic mutations. Expression profiles for DNA replication/repair genes and the mutation status of KRAS, NRAS, FLT3, and KIT were compared with the karyotypic changes at diagnosis and relapse(s) in 94 cases of inv(16)(p13.1q22)-AML and 82 cases of t(8;21)(q22;q22)-AML. The majority of both AML types demonstrated a simple aneuploid pattern of cytogenetic progression, with highly distinctive patterns of chromosome copy number changes, such as +22 and +13 exclusively in inv(16)-AML and -Y and -X in t(8;21)-AML. Selection of certain cytogenetic changes correlated with particular somatic mutations, such as +8 with RAS mutation, and absence of kinase pathway mutations in t(8;21)-AML with localized deletions at chromosome band 9q22. Alterations in transcript levels of mitotic spindle kinases such as CHEK1, AURKA, and AURKB were associated with the aneuploid progression pattern, particularly in t(8;21) cases. Despite the similarity in the initiating genetics of the two CBF AML types, highly tumor-specific patterns of limited aneuploidy are noted that persist and continue to accumulate at relapse. Thus, activation of genetic instability, possibly through mitotic spindle dysregulation, leads rapidly to the selection of advantageous single chromosome aneuploidy.","['Jones, Dan', 'Yao, Hui', 'Romans, Angela', 'Dando, Caroline', 'Pierce, Sherry', 'Borthakur, Gautam', 'Hamilton, Amy', 'Bueso-Ramos, Carlos', 'Ravandi, Farhad', 'Garcia-Manero, Guillermo', 'Kantarjian, Hagop']","['Jones D', 'Yao H', 'Romans A', 'Dando C', 'Pierce S', 'Borthakur G', 'Hamilton A', 'Bueso-Ramos C', 'Ravandi F', 'Garcia-Manero G', 'Kantarjian H']","['Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas M.

These tumors rarely lose TP53, which is the most commonly mutated gene in cancer. Recent work has shown that the basal level of p53 plays an important role in maternal reproduction by maintaining the expression of LIF in the uterus. Since LIF can maintain the undifferentiated state of stem cells we set out to ask if p53 regulates LIF in the human medulloblastoma cell lines DAOY and D283MED. We also used p53-/- and p53+/+ isogenic HCT116 colorectal carcinoma cell lines, already reported to exhibit p53-dependent expression of the LIF D transcript, to establish the extent of p53-dependency for LIF M and T alternative transcripts. Whilst all three known, full-length alternative transcripts are more abundant in p53+/+ cells, the alternative LIF M and T transcripts appear particularly sensitive to p53. In the p53 wild-type medulloblastoma cell line D283MED chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments showed p53 binding to the LIF gene. The mutant p53 expressed in line DAOY did not bind to this region or to the p21(WAF1) p53 binding site. RNA interference against either WIP1 or SIRT1 stabilized p53 and enhanced the transcription of LIF in D283MED cells. Interestingly, siRNA against WIP1 or SIRT1 also induced increased apoptosis in the medulloblastoma line D283MED and, over a longer time period, in DAOY cells. We speculate that suppression of p53 function by combined WIP1-mediated dephosphorylation and SIRT1 deacetylation enables medulloblastoma cell survival but p53-dependent and independent apoptotic pathways remain intact. Thus small molecule inhibitors of SIRT1 may be useful in treatment of medulloblastoma.","['Baxter, Euan W', 'Milner, Jo']","['Baxter EW', 'Milner J']","['Department of Biology, Yorkshire Cancer Research p53 Research Unit, University of York, Heslington YO10 5DD, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20091112,United States,J Neurooncol,Journal of neuro-oncology,8309335,"['0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', 'EC 3.1.3.16 (PPM1D protein, human)', 'EC 3.1.3.16 (Phosphoprotein Phosphatases)', 'EC 3.1.3.16 (Protein Phosphatase 2C)', 'EC 3.5.1.- (SIRT1 protein, human)', 'EC 3.5.1.- (Sirtuin 1)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/genetics/*physiology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Chromatin Immunoprecipitation/methods', 'Flow Cytometry/methods', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects/genetics/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/*metabolism', 'Medulloblastoma/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Phosphoprotein Phosphatases/metabolism', 'Protein Binding/genetics', 'Protein Phosphatase 2C', 'RNA, Small Interfering/genetics/metabolism', 'Sirtuin 1/genetics/metabolism', 'Transfection/methods', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/deficiency/genetics/*physiology']",2009/11/13 06:00,2010/07/14 06:00,['2009/11/13 06:00'],"['2009/06/27 00:00 [received]', '2009/10/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/11/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/11/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/07/14 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s11060-009-0043-x [doi]'],ppublish,J Neurooncol. 2010 May;97(3):373-82. doi: 10.1007/s11060-009-0043-x.

We demonstrate that direct, high-affinity binding of the hydrocarbon-stapled peptide SAHM1 prevents assembly of the active transcriptional complex. Inappropriate NOTCH activation is directly implicated in the pathogenesis of several disease states, including T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (T-ALL). The treatment of leukaemic cells with SAHM1 results in genome-wide suppression of NOTCH-activated genes.

It couples the antigen-activated T-cell receptor to downstream signaling pathways. Its expression in leukemic B-cells derived from a subgroup of patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is associated with an aggressive course of the disease. However, its implication for the pathogenesis of aggressive CLL is still unclear. In this study, we show that the expression of ZAP-70 enhances the signals associated with the B-cell receptor, recruiting protein kinase C-betaII (PKC-betaII) into lipid raft domains. Subsequently, PKC-betaII is activated and shuttles from the plasma membrane to the mitochondria. We unravel that the antiapoptotic protein Bcl-2 and its antagonistic BH3-protein Bim(EL) are putative substrates for PKC-betaII. PKC-betaII-mediated phosphorylation of Bcl-2 augments its antiapoptotic function by increasing its ability to sequester more pro-apoptotic Bim(EL.) In addition, the phosphorylation of Bim(EL) by PKC-betaII leads to its proteasomal degradation. These changes confer leukemic cells to a more antiapoptotic state with aggressiveness of the disease. Most importantly, these molecular changes can be therapeutically targeted with the small molecule inhibitor Enzastaurin. We provide evidence that this compound is highly active in leukemic cells and augments the cytotoxic effects of standard chemotherapeutic drugs.","['zum Buschenfelde, C Meyer', 'Wagner, M', 'Lutzny, G', 'Oelsner, M', 'Feuerstacke, Y', 'Decker, T', 'Bogner, C', 'Peschel, C', 'Ringshausen, I']","['zum Buschenfelde CM', 'Wagner M', 'Lutzny G', 'Oelsner M', 'Feuerstacke Y', 'Decker T', 'Bogner C', 'Peschel C', 'Ringshausen I']","['3rd Department of Medicine, Hematology and Oncology, Technical University, Munich 81675, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20091112,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Indoles)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (ZAP-70 Protein-Tyrosine Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (ZAP70 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C beta)', 'EC 3.4.25.1 (Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex)', 'UC96G28EQF (enzastaurin)']",IM,"['*Apoptosis', 'Humans', 'Indoles/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Membrane Microdomains/*metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex/metabolism', 'Protein Kinase C/*physiology', 'Protein Kinase C beta', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell/physiology', 'Signal Transduction', 'ZAP-70 Protein-Tyrosine Kinase/*physiology']",2009/11/13 06:00,2010/01/28 06:00,['2009/11/13 06:00'],"['2009/11/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/11/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/01/28 06:00 [medline]']","['leu2009216 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2009.216 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2010 Jan;24(1):141-52. doi: 10.1038/leu.2009.216.

Short latency to leukemia and very high concordance rate for ALL in Mixed-Lineage Leukemia (MLL)-positive infant twins suggest that the MLL rearrangement itself could be sufficient for overt leukemia. Attempts to generate a suitable mouse model for MLL-AF4-positive ALL did not thoroughly resolve the issue of whether cooperating mutations are required to reduce latency and to generate overt leukemia in vivo. In this study, we applied single-nucleotide polymorphism array technology to perform genomic profiling of 28 infant ALL cases carrying t(4;11) to detect MLL-cooperating aberrations hidden to conventional techniques and to gain new insights into infant ALL pathogenesis. In contrast to pediatric, adolescent and adult ALL cases, the MLL rearrangement in infant ALL is associated with an exceptionally low frequency of copy-number abnormalities, thus confirming the unique nature of this disease. By contrast, additional genetic aberrations are acquired at disease relapse. Small-segmental uniparental disomy traits were frequently detected, mostly constitutional, and widely distributed throughout the genome. It can be argued that the MLL rearrangement as a first hit, rather than inducing the acquisition of additional genetic lesions, has a major role to drive and hasten the onset of leukemia.","['Bardini, M', 'Spinelli, R', 'Bungaro, S', 'Mangano, E', 'Corral, L', 'Cifola, I', 'Fazio, G', 'Giordan, M', 'Basso, G', 'De Rossi, G', 'Biondi, A', 'Battaglia, C', 'Cazzaniga, G']","['Bardini M', 'Spinelli R', 'Bungaro S', 'Mangano E', 'Corral L', 'Cifola I', 'Fazio G', 'Giordan M', 'Basso G', 'De Rossi G', 'Biondi A', 'Battaglia C', 'Cazzaniga G']","['Centro Ricerca Tettamanti, Clinica Pediatrica Univ.

Despite the diverse effects of IMiDs in vitro, the relative contribution of each effect towards their ultimate anti-MM activity is still unclear. Based on in vitro data, it appears that anti-proliferative effects and downregulation of crucial cytokines are their most important anti-MM attributes. Although the co-stimulatory effects on T and NK cells have been heralded as a unique and important property of IMiDs towards enhancing anti-MM immune activity, these in vitro effects have yet to be firmly corroborated in vivo. Much is yet to be elucidated regarding the complex interplay of immunomodulatory cytokines that occurs in vivo, which ultimately dictates the net effects of IMiDs in MM-the understanding of which is necessary to facilitate optimal manipulation of these drugs in future MM management.","['Quach, H', 'Ritchie, D', 'Stewart, A K', 'Neeson, P', 'Harrison, S', 'Smyth, M J', 'Prince, H M']","['Quach H', 'Ritchie D', 'Stewart AK', 'Neeson P', 'Harrison S', 'Smyth MJ', 'Prince HM']","['Department of Haematology and Medical Oncology, Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre, St Andrews Place, East Melbourne, Victoria 3053, Australia. hang.quach@petermac.org']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20091112,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Angiogenesis Inhibitors)', '0 (Anti-Inflammatory Agents)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (FOXP3 protein, human)', '0 (Forkhead Transcription Factors)', '0 (Immunologic Factors)', '4Z8R6ORS6L (Thalidomide)']",IM,"['Angiogenesis Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Anti-Inflammatory Agents/pharmacology', 'Antibody-Dependent Cell Cytotoxicity', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Forkhead Transcription Factors/analysis', 'Humans', 'Immunologic Factors/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Killer Cells, Natural/drug effects/immunology', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Multiple Myeloma/*drug therapy/immunology', 'Osteoclasts/drug effects', 'T-Lymphocytes, Regulatory/drug effects/immunology', 'Thalidomide/*analogs & derivatives']",2009/11/13 06:00,2010/01/28 06:00,['2009/11/13 06:00'],"['2009/11/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/11/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/01/28 06:00 [medline]']","['leu2009236 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2009.236 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2010 Jan;24(1):22-32. doi: 10.1038/leu.2009.236.

Pharmacokinetic studies showed that the antitumor activity of cladribine by 2-hour infusion should be comparable to that given by continuous infusion. The safety and anti-tumor activity of short infusion of cladribine was shown in hairy cell leukemia, chronic lymphocytic leukemia and low-grade non-Hodgkin's lymphoma in Europe. We therefore underwent a pilot study to confirm the safety and efficacy of cladribine given by 2-hour infusion for Japanese patients with relapsed or refractory indolent B-cell lymphoma. Cladribine at a dose of 0.09 mg/kg was administered in 2-hour intravenous infusion for 5 consecutive days. The treatment was repeated at a 28-day interval for at least 2 cycles, and its efficacy and toxicity were investigated. Fourteen patients were entered into this study. Eight patients (57%) responded to cladribine, including 2 (14%) complete response (CR) and 6 (43%) partial response (PR). The median duration of response was 20+ and 21+ months for CR, and 12 months ranging from 3 to 34 months for PR, respectively. Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia and lymphocytopenia occurred in 43% and 71% of patients, respectively, but there was no febrile neutropenia or opportunistic infection associated with cladribine treatment. No other adverse events greater than grade 3 were encountered. The tumor response and degree of toxicity were comparable with those observed in cladribine treatment given by continuous infusion at a same dose. Cladribine can be administered in 2-hour infusion in an outpatient clinic and is therefore quite convenient for patients.","['Takamatsu, Yasushi', 'Suzumiya, Junji', 'Ogata, Kentaro', 'Katayose, Keiko', 'Sasaki, Hidenori', 'Ishitsuka, Kenji', 'Kimura, Nobuhiro', 'Tamura, Kazuo']","['Takamatsu Y', 'Suzumiya J', 'Ogata K', 'Katayose K', 'Sasaki H', 'Ishitsuka K', 'Kimura N', 'Tamura K']","['Division of Medical Oncology, Hematology and Infectious Disease, Department of Medicine, Fukuoka University Hospital, Jonan-ku, Fukuoka, Japan. yasushi@fukuoka-u.ac.jp']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Japan,J Clin Exp Hematop,Journal of clinical and experimental hematopathology : JCEH,101141257,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '47M74X9YT5 (Cladribine)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Ambulatory Care/methods', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Asians', 'Cladribine/*administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infusions, Intravenous', 'Japan', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Pilot Projects', 'Recurrence', 'Retrospective Studies']",2009/11/13 06:00,2010/01/23 06:00,['2009/11/13 06:00'],"['2009/11/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/11/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/01/23 06:00 [medline]']","['JST.JSTAGE/jslrt/49.69 [pii]', '10.3960/jslrt.49.69 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Exp Hematop. 2009 Nov;49(2):69-75. doi: 10.3960/jslrt.49.69.,49,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Many molecular studies have tried to establish a pathogenic role for HHV-6 in lymphoid malignancies. However, whether HHV-6 plays a role in these pathologies remains unclear, as positive polymerase chain reaction results for HHV-6 in those studies may reflect latent infection or reactivation rather than presence of HHV-6 in neoplastic cells. A small number of studies have investigated HHV-6 antigen expression in pathologic specimens. As a result, the lack of HHV-6 antigen expression on neoplastic cells argues against any major pathogenic role of HHV-6. The role of HHV-6 in childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) has also been of interest but remains controversial, with 2 studies documenting higher levels of HHV-6 antibody in ALL patients, and another 2 large-scale studies finding no significant differences in HHV-6 seroprevalences between ALL patients and controls. Alternatively, HHV-6 is increasingly recognized as an important opportunistic pathogen. HHV-6 reactivation is common among recipients of allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT), and is linked to various clinical manifestations. In particular, HHV-6 encephalitis appears to be significant, life-threatening complication. Most HHV-6 encephalitis develops in patients receiving transplant from an unrelated donor, particularly cord blood, typically around the time of engraftment. Symptoms are characterized by short-term memory loss and seizures. Magnetic resonance imaging typically shows limbic encephalitis. Prognosis for HHV-6 encephalitis is poor, but appropriate prophylactic measures have not been established. Establishment of preventive strategies against HHV-6 encephalitis represents an important challenge for physicians involved with SCT.","['Ogata, Masao']",['Ogata M'],"['Department of Hematology, Oita University Faculty of Medicine, Yufu-city, Oita, Japan. mogata@med.oita-u.ac.jp']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,Japan,J Clin Exp Hematop,Journal of clinical and experimental hematopathology : JCEH,101141257,"['0 (Antigens, Viral)']",IM,"['Antigens, Viral/biosynthesis', 'Encephalitis, Viral/prevention & control/transmission/*virology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Viral/physiology', 'Herpesvirus 6, Human/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Opportunistic Infections/prevention & control/*virology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/therapy/*virology', 'Roseolovirus Infections/prevention & control/transmission/*virology', 'Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Virus Activation/physiology', 'Virus Latency/physiology']",2009/11/13 06:00,2010/01/23 06:00,['2009/11/13 06:00'],"['2009/11/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/11/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/01/23 06:00 [medline]']","['JST.JSTAGE/jslrt/49.57 [pii]', '10.3960/jslrt.49.57 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Exp Hematop. 2009 Nov;49(2):57-67. doi: 10.3960/jslrt.49.57.,49,,,,,67,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), which is initiated by alloreactive donor T cells that recognize mismatched major and/or minor histocompatibility antigens and cause severe damage to hematopoietic and epithelial tissues, is a potentially lethal complication of allogeneic BMT. To enhance the therapeutic potential of BMT, we sought to find therapeutic targets that could inhibit GVHD while preserving GVL and immune responses to infectious agents. We show here that T cell responses triggered in mice by either Listeria monocytogenes or administration of antigen and adjuvant were relatively well preserved in the absence of PKC isoform theta (PKCtheta), a key regulator of TCR signaling. In contrast, PKCtheta was required for alloreactivity and GVHD induction. Furthermore, absence of PKCtheta raised the threshold for T cell activation, which selectively affected alloresponses. Most importantly, PKCtheta-deficient T cells retained the ability to respond to virus infection and to induce GVL effect after BMT. These findings suggest PKCtheta is a potentially unique therapeutic target required for GVHD induction but not for GVL or protective responses to infectious agents.","['Valenzuela, Javier O', 'Iclozan, Cristina', 'Hossain, Mohammad S', 'Prlic, Martin', 'Hopewell, Emily', 'Bronk, Crystina C', 'Wang, Junmei', 'Celis, Esteban', 'Engelman, Robert W', 'Blazar, Bruce R', 'Bevan, Michael J', 'Waller, Edmund K', 'Yu, Xue-Zhong', 'Beg, Amer A']","['Valenzuela JO', 'Iclozan C', 'Hossain MS', 'Prlic M', 'Hopewell E', 'Bronk CC', 'Wang J', 'Celis E', 'Engelman RW', 'Blazar BR', 'Bevan MJ', 'Waller EK', 'Yu XZ', 'Beg AA']","['H.

However, lens injury (LI) or intravitreal application of zymosan switch RGCs into an active regenerative state, enabling these neurons to survive axotomy and to regenerate axons into the injured optic nerve. Several factors have been proposed to mediate the beneficial effects of LI. Here, we investigated the contribution of glial-derived ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF) to LI-mediated regeneration and neuroprotection using wild-type and CNTF-deficient mice. In wild-type mice, CNTF expression was strongly upregulated in retinal astrocytes, the JAK/STAT3 pathway was activated in RGCs, and RGCs were transformed into an active regenerative state after LI. Interestingly, retinal LIF expression was correlated with CNTF expression after LI. In CNTF-deficient mice, the neuroprotective and axon growth-promoting effects of LI were significantly reduced compared with wild-type animals, despite an observed compensatory upregulation of LIF expression in CNTF-deficient mice. The positive effects of LI and also zymosan were completely abolished in CNTF/LIF double knock-out mice, whereas LI-induced glial and macrophage activation was not compromised. In culture CNTF and LIF markedly stimulated neurite outgrowth of mature RGCs. These data confirm a key role for CNTF in directly mediating the neuroprotective and axon regenerative effects of inflammatory stimulation in the eye and identify LIF as an additional contributing factor.","['Leibinger, Marco', 'Muller, Adrienne', 'Andreadaki, Anastasia', 'Hauk, Thomas G', 'Kirsch, Matthias', 'Fischer, Dietmar']","['Leibinger M', 'Muller A', 'Andreadaki A', 'Hauk TG', 'Kirsch M', 'Fischer D']","['Department of Experimental Neurology, University of Ulm, 89081 Ulm, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,J Neurosci,The Journal of neuroscience : the official journal of the Society for Neuroscience,8102140,"['0 (Central Nervous System Agents)', '0 (Ciliary Neurotrophic Factor)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Stat3 protein, mouse)', '9010-72-4 (Zymosan)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Axons/drug effects/*immunology/*physiology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Central Nervous System Agents/toxicity', 'Ciliary Neurotrophic Factor/genetics/*metabolism', 'Janus Kinases/metabolism', 'Lens, Crystalline/injuries', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/genetics/*metabolism', 'Macrophages/drug effects/immunology/physiology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Nerve Regeneration/drug effects/immunology/physiology', 'Neurites/immunology/physiology', 'Neuroglia/drug effects/immunology/physiology', 'Optic Nerve Injuries/immunology/physiopathology', 'Retina/drug effects/immunology/physiopathology', 'Retinal Ganglion Cells/drug effects/*immunology/*physiology', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Zymosan/toxicity']",2009/11/13 06:00,2009/12/16 06:00,['2009/11/13 06:00'],"['2009/11/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/11/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2009/12/16 06:00 [medline]']","['29/45/14334 [pii]', '10.1523/JNEUROSCI.2770-09.2009 [doi]']",ppublish,J Neurosci. 2009 Nov 11;29(45):14334-41. doi: 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.2770-09.2009.,29,,,PMC6665071,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Enrolled patients were followed until rhGH discontinuation. Investigators submitted adverse event reports for targeted events or those potentially rhGH-related. RESULTS: Early concerns about de novo leukemia in patients without risk factors have not been substantiated--three observed vs. 5.6 expected in age-matched general population based on years at risk [standard incidence ratio (SIR), 0.54; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.11-1.58]. De novo malignancies (intracranial and extracranial) were not significantly increased in patients without risk factors (29 confirmed vs. 26 expected; SIR, 1.12; 95% CI, 0.75-1.61). Second neoplasms occurred in 49 patients, of whom 37 had irradiation for their initial tumors (including five of 16 retinoblastoma patients, three of whom had bilateral retinoblastoma) consistent with an increased risk with rhGH. Thirty-three patients developed type 1 diabetes mellitus (DM) (37 expected; SIR, 0.90; 95% CI, 0.62-1.26). Type 2 DM and nonspecified DM were reported in 20 and eight patients, respectively. Two deaths were reported in patients with Prader-Willi syndrome and five deaths from aortic dissection in patients with Turner syndrome. In patients with organic GH deficiency and idiopathic panhypopituitarism, 11 events of acute adrenal insufficiency occurred, including four deaths, consistent with a reported increased risk for adrenal insufficiency in hypopituitary patients with or without rhGH treatment. CONCLUSION: After more than 20 yr, leukemia, a major safety issue initially believed associated with GH, has not been confirmed, but other signals, including risk of second malignancies in patients previously treated with irradiation, have been detected or confirmed through the NCGS.

The NEUT-X and NEUT-Y values in MDS patients with optical hypogranulation were significantly lower than for MDS patients without optical hypogranulation. NEUT-X and NEUT-Y values lower than 1298 and 398, respectively, would have a specificity for detecting MDS of 94% and 91% and would detect 60% and 56% of cases, respectively, whereas they would detect 75% and 74%, respectively, of MDS cases with optical hypogranulation.

OBJECTIVE: To examine the association between adherence with imatinib and direct healthcare costs and resource utilization in a large group of privately insured CML patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: CML patients under age 65 were identified with ICD-9 code 205.1X using MarketScan Commercial Claims data between 1/1/02 and 7/31/08. Patients were required to be continuously enrolled in a private insurance plan during the baseline and study periods, defined respectively as the 4 months prior to and the 12 months following imatinib initiation. Non-adherence was evaluated by the medication possession ratio (MPR), defined as the fraction of days during the study period that patients had filled prescriptions for imatinib, and stratified into two groups (low MPR: <85%, high MPR: > or =85%). Costs, inpatient admissions, and hospital days were compared between high and low adherence groups using Wilcoxon tests. Regression models compared utilization and costs controlling for age, sex, CML severity, Charlson comorbidity index, baseline costs, and other factors. RESULTS: The study sample consisted of 592 patients, where 242 (40.9%) patients were classified with a low MPR, while 350 (59.1%) had a high MPR. Mean MPR was 79% (95% confidence interval 76-81%). Patients with a low MPR incurred more all-cause inpatient visits (4.1 vs. 0.4; p < 0.001) and all-cause inpatient days (14.8 vs. 1.8; p < 0.001). Regression models demonstrated a 283% increase (US$56 324; p < 0.001) in non-imatinib costs within the low- vs. high-MPR group. The generalizability of this study is limited by the use of a privately insured population under 65 years of age as well as by the limitations common to claims data analyses. CONCLUSIONS: Imatinib adherence is an important issue for patients and physicians. Better imatinib adherence was associated with significantly lower resource utilization and costs in CML patients, as lower imatinib costs in low MPR patients were more than offset by higher non-imatinib costs mostly driven by inpatient services.","['Wu, Eric Q', 'Johnson, Scott', 'Beaulieu, Nicolas', 'Arana, Mateo', 'Bollu, Vamsi', 'Guo, Amy', 'Coombs, John', 'Feng, Weiwei', 'Cortes, Jorge']","['Wu EQ', 'Johnson S', 'Beaulieu N', 'Arana M', 'Bollu V', 'Guo A', 'Coombs J', 'Feng W', 'Cortes J']","['Analysis Group Inc., Boston, MA 02199, USA.

First, silver-embedded magnetic NPs are prepared, composed of an 18-nm magnetic core and a 16-nm-thick silica shell with silver NPs formed on the surface. After simple aromatic compounds are adsorbed on the silver-embedded magnetic NPs, they are coated with silica to provide them with chemical and physical stability. The resulting silica-encapsulated magnetic NPs (M-SERS dots) produce strong SERS signals and have magnetic properties. In a model application as a tagging material, the M-SERS dots are successfully utilized for targeting breast-cancer cells (SKBR3) and floating leukemia cells (SP2/O). The targeted cancer cells can be easily separated from the untargeted cells using an external magnetic field. The separated targeted cancer cells exhibit a Raman signal originating from the M-SERS dots. This system proves to be an efficient tool for separating targeted cells. Additionally, the magnetic-field-induced hot spots, which can provide a 1000-times-stronger SERS intensity due to aggregation of the NPs, are studied.","['Jun, Bong-Hyun', 'Noh, Mi Suk', 'Kim, Jaeyun', 'Kim, Gunsung', 'Kang, Homan', 'Kim, Min-Soo', 'Seo, Young-Tae', 'Baek, Jongho', 'Kim, Jong-Ho', 'Park, Juyoung', 'Kim, Seongyong', 'Kim, Yong-Kweon', 'Hyeon, Taeghwan', 'Cho, Myung-Haing', 'Jeong, Dae Hong', 'Lee, Yoon-Sik']","['Jun BH', 'Noh MS', 'Kim J', 'Kim G', 'Kang H', 'Kim MS', 'Seo YT', 'Baek J', 'Kim JH', 'Park J', 'Kim S', 'Kim YK', 'Hyeon T', 'Cho MH', 'Jeong DH', 'Lee YS']","['School of Chemical and Biological Engineering, Seoul National University, Seoul 151-747, Republic of Korea.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Germany,Small,"Small (Weinheim an der Bergstrasse, Germany)",101235338,"['0 (Macromolecular Substances)', '3M4G523W1G (Silver)']",IM,"['Crystallization/*methods', 'Macromolecular Substances/chemistry', 'Magnetics', 'Materials Testing', 'Molecular Conformation', '*Molecular Probe Techniques', 'Nanostructures/*chemistry/*ultrastructure', 'Nanotechnology/*methods', 'Particle Size', 'Silver/*chemistry', 'Spectrum Analysis, Raman/*methods', 'Surface Properties']",2009/11/12 06:00,2010/03/11 06:00,['2009/11/12 06:00'],"['2009/11/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/11/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/03/11 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/smll.200901459 [doi]'],ppublish,Small. 2010 Jan;6(1):119-25. doi: 10.1002/smll.200901459.,6,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recent insights point toward a significant role of aberrant DNA methylation in leukemogenesis. Therefore, we investigated the prognostic impact of DNA methylation in AML. To screen for promoter methylation in AML we applied a combination of base-specific cleavage biochemistry and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS), a powerful methodology allowing for quantitatively investigating DNA methylation status in a large series of both promoter regions and leukemia samples. We analyzed 92 genomic regions in 182 patient samples, correlated findings with clinical and molecular data, and validated the results in an independent cohort of 74 AML samples. Using this approach, we were able to identify novel leukemia subgroups based on distinct DNA methylation patterns. Furthermore, we defined a methylation-based outcome predictor for patient survival (P < .01) that in multivariable analysis provided independent prognostic information (hazard ratio, 1.52; 95% CI, 1.06-2.16). Here, we report the first large-scale methylation-based outcome predictor in AML, and thereby our findings support the use of genomic methylation markers for improved molecular classification and prognostication in adult AML.","['Bullinger, Lars', 'Ehrich, Mathias', 'Dohner, Konstanze', 'Schlenk, Richard F', 'Dohner, Hartmut', 'Nelson, Matthew R', 'van den Boom, Dirk']","['Bullinger L', 'Ehrich M', 'Dohner K', 'Schlenk RF', 'Dohner H', 'Nelson MR', 'van den Boom D']","['Department of Internal Medicine III, University of Ulm, Ulm, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Validation Study']",20091110,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 17', 'CpG Islands/genetics', 'Cytogenetic Analysis/methods', '*DNA Methylation/physiology', 'DNA, Neoplasm/analysis', 'Gene Expression Profiling/methods', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*diagnosis/genetics/*mortality', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis/methods', 'Prognosis', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/genetics', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA/*methods', 'Survival Analysis']",2009/11/12 06:00,2010/02/24 06:00,['2009/11/12 06:00'],"['2009/11/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/11/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/02/24 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)49323-1 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2009-03-211003 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2010 Jan 21;115(3):636-42. doi: 10.1182/blood-2009-03-211003.

Nicotine, a major component in tobacco smoke, functions as a survival agonist that inhibits apoptosis following various stresses. However, the mechanism of action remains elusive. Mcl-1, a major antiapoptotic protein of the Bcl2 family, is extensively expressed in both small cell and non-small cell lung cancer cells, suggesting that Mcl-1 may be a therapeutic target of patients with lung cancer. Here, we found that nicotine induces Mcl-1 phosphorylation through activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 in association with increased chemoresistance of human lung cancer cells. Since nicotine stimulates Mcl-1 phosphorylation and survival in cells expressing wild-type but has no such effects in cells expressing T163A Mcl-1 mutant, this indicates that nicotine induces Mcl-1 phosphorylation exclusively at the T163 site and that phosphorylation of Mcl-1 at T163 is required for nicotine-induced survival. Mechanistically, nicotine-induced Mcl-1 phosphorylation significantly enhances the half-life of Mcl-1, which renders Mcl-1 a long-term survival activity. Specific depletion of Mcl-1 by RNA interference blocks nicotine-stimulated survival and enhances apoptotic cell death. Thus, nicotine-enhanced survival of lung cancer cells may occur through activation of Mcl-1 by phosphorylation at T163 site, which may contribute to development of human lung cancer and/or chemoresistance.","['Zhao, Jinfeng', 'Xin, Meiguo', 'Wang, Ton', 'Zhang, Yangde', 'Deng, Xingming']","['Zhao J', 'Xin M', 'Wang T', 'Zhang Y', 'Deng X']","['National Hepatobiliary and Enteric Surgery Research Center, Department of Surgery, Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, Changsha, Hunan, PR China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20091110,United States,Mol Cancer Res,Molecular cancer research : MCR,101150042,"['0 (Flavonoids)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Receptors, Adrenergic, beta)', '1114-81-4 (Phosphothreonine)', '6M3C89ZY6R (Nicotine)', '9Y8NXQ24VQ (Propranolol)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 3)', 'SJE1IO5E3I (2-(2-amino-3-methoxyphenyl)-4H-1-benzopyran-4-one)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/drug effects', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Flavonoids/pharmacology', 'Half-Life', 'Humans', 'Lung Neoplasms/enzymology/pathology', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 3/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Nicotine/*pharmacology', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Phosphothreonine/metabolism', 'Propranolol/pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Adrenergic, beta/metabolism']",2009/11/12 06:00,2010/02/20 06:00,['2009/11/12 06:00'],"['2009/11/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/11/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/02/20 06:00 [medline]']","['1541-7786.MCR-09-0304 [pii]', '10.1158/1541-7786.MCR-09-0304 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Cancer Res. 2009 Dec;7(12):1954-61. doi: 10.1158/1541-7786.MCR-09-0304.

The current study investigates the role of aberrant HLA class II antigen presentation on leukemic blasts by determining both the clinical and functional impact of the class II-associated invariant chain peptide (CLIP). DESIGN AND METHODS: The levels of expression of CLIP and HLA-DR on blood and bone marrow samples from 207 patients with acute myeloid leukemia were correlated with clinical outcome. Irradiated CLIP(-) and CLIP(+) leukemic blasts were compared for their ability to induce CD4(+) T cells during mixed leukocyte reactions. To discriminate between these blasts, we down-modulated CLIP expression on myeloid leukemic cell lines by RNA interference of the invariant chain, a chaperone protein critically involved in HLA-DR processing, and performed flow cytometric sorting for their isolation from primary acute myeloid leukemia samples. RESULTS: We found that patients with leukemic blasts characterized by a high amount of HLA-DR occupied by CLIP (relative amount of CLIP) had a significantly shortened disease-free survival. The clear reductions in amount of HLA-DR occupied by CLIP on blasts of the THP-1 and Kasumi-1 myeloid leukemic cell lines after treatment with invariant chain short interfering RNA resulted in enhanced rates of allogeneic CD4(+) T-cell proliferation. Similar findings were obtained in an autologous setting, in which there were strong increases in proliferation of remission CD4(+) T cells stimulated with CLIP(-)-sorted leukemic blasts from HLA-DR(+) acute myeloid leukemia patients, in contrast to CLIP(+)-sorted leukemic blasts from the same patients. CONCLUSIONS: These data highlight the relevance of CLIP expression on leukemic blasts and the potential of CLIP as a target for immunomodulatory strategies to enhance HLA class II antigen presentation and CD4(+) T-cell reactivity in acute myeloid leukemia.","['van Luijn, Marvin M', 'Chamuleau, Martine E D', 'Thompson, James A', 'Ostrand-Rosenberg, Suzanne', 'Westers, Theresia M', 'Souwer, Yuri', 'Ossenkoppele, Gert J', 'van Ham, S Marieke', 'van de Loosdrecht, Arjan A']","['van Luijn MM', 'Chamuleau ME', 'Thompson JA', 'Ostrand-Rosenberg S', 'Westers TM', 'Souwer Y', 'Ossenkoppele GJ', 'van Ham SM', 'van de Loosdrecht AA']","['Department of Hematology, VU Institute for Cancer and Immunology, Cancer Center Amsterdam, VU University Medical Center, De Boelelaan 1117, 1081 HV Amsterdam, The Netherlands. m.luijn@vumc.nl']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20091110,Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,"['0 (Antigens, Differentiation, B-Lymphocyte)', '0 (HLA-DR Antigens)', '0 (Histocompatibility Antigens Class II)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (invariant chain)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antigen Presentation', 'Antigens, Differentiation, B-Lymphocyte/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Blast Crisis', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Female', 'HLA-DR Antigens/*immunology', 'Histocompatibility Antigens Class II/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*immunology/pathology', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', 'RNA, Small Interfering/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Young Adult']",2009/11/12 06:00,2010/07/09 06:00,['2009/11/12 06:00'],"['2009/11/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/11/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/07/09 06:00 [medline]']","['haematol.2009.010595 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.2009.010595 [doi]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2010 Mar;95(3):485-93. doi: 10.3324/haematol.2009.010595.

The incidence and prognostic significance of additional chromosomal abnormalities in acute promyelocytic leukemia is still a controversial matter. DESIGN AND METHODS: Based on cytogenetic data available for 495 patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia enrolled in two consecutive PETHEMA trials (LPA96 and LPA99), we analyzed the incidence, characteristics, and outcome of patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia with and without additional chromosomal abnormalities who had been treated with all-trans retinoic acid plus anthracycline monochemotherapy for induction and consolidation. RESULTS: Additional chromosomal abnormalities were observed in 140 patients (28%). Trisomy 8 was the most frequent abnormality (36%), followed by abn(7q) (5%). Patients with additional chromosomal abnormalities more frequently had coagulopathy (P=0.03), lower platelet counts (P=0.02), and higher relapse-risk scores (P=0.02) than their counterparts without additional abnormalities. No significant association with FLT3/ITD or other clinicopathological characteristics was demonstrated. Patients with and without additional chromosomal abnormalities had similar complete remission rates (90% and 91%, respectively). Univariate analysis showed that additional chromosomal abnormalities were associated with a lower relapse-free survival in the LPA99 trial (P=0.04), but not in the LPA96 trial. However, neither additional chromosomal abnormalities overall nor any specific abnormality was identified as an independent risk factor for relapse in multivariate analysis. CONCLUSIONS: The lack of independent prognostic value of additional chromosomal abnormalities in acute promyelocytic leukemia does not support the use of alternative therapeutic strategies when such abnormalities are found.","['Cervera, Jose', 'Montesinos, Pau', 'Hernandez-Rivas, Jesus M', 'Calasanz, Maria J', 'Aventin, Anna', 'Ferro, Maria T', 'Luno, Elisa', 'Sanchez, Javier', 'Vellenga, Edo', 'Rayon, Chelo', 'Milone, Gustavo', 'de la Serna, Javier', 'Rivas, Concha', 'Gonzalez, Jose D', 'Tormo, Mar', 'Amutio, Elena', 'Gonzalez, Marcos', 'Brunet, Salut', 'Lowenberg, Bob', 'Sanz, Miguel A']","['Cervera J', 'Montesinos P', 'Hernandez-Rivas JM', 'Calasanz MJ', 'Aventin A', 'Ferro MT', 'Luno E', 'Sanchez J', 'Vellenga E', 'Rayon C', 'Milone G', 'de la Serna J', 'Rivas C', 'Gonzalez JD', 'Tormo M', 'Amutio E', 'Gonzalez M', 'Brunet S', 'Lowenberg B', 'Sanz MA']","['Hospital Universitario La Fe, Avenida Campanar, 21, 46009 Valencia, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20091110,Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', '*Chromosome Aberrations', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 15/genetics', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 17/genetics', 'Cohort Studies', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*drug therapy/*genetics/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local/drug therapy/genetics/pathology', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'Remission Induction', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Survival Rate', 'Translocation, Genetic', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Tretinoin/*therapeutic use', 'Young Adult']",2009/11/12 06:00,2010/07/09 06:00,['2009/11/12 06:00'],"['2009/11/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/11/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/07/09 06:00 [medline]']","['haematol.2009.013243 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.2009.013243 [doi]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2010 Mar;95(3):424-31. doi: 10.3324/haematol.2009.013243.

We assessed the utility of this index for predicting time to first treatment in early chronic lymphocytic leukemia. DESIGN AND METHODS: An observational database of the GIMEMA (Gruppo Italiano Malattie EMatologiche dell'Adulto), which included 310 patients with newly diagnosed Binet stage A chronic lymphocytic leukemia who were observed at different primary hematology centers during the period 1991 - 2000, was used for the purpose of this study. RESULTS: The new prognostic index enabled Binet stage A patients to be divided into two subgroups that differed with respect to time to first treatment (P=0.003). The original prognostic index was derived from a database that included cases observed at a reference academic center; these patients were younger (P<0.0001) and had more advanced disease (P<0.0001) than those in the current investigation, which studied community-based patients whose data were recorded at presentation. With this in mind, we used an optimal cut-off search to determine how best to split patients with Binet stage A disease into different prognostic groups. According to the recursive partitioning (RPART) model, a classification tree was built that identified three subsets of patients who scores were 0-2 (low risk), 3-4 (intermediate risk) and 5-7 (high risk). The probability of remaining free from therapy at 5 years was 100% in the low risk group, 81.2% in the intermediate risk group and 61.3% in the high risk group (P<0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study confirm the utility of a new prognostic index for predicting time to first treatment in a large sample series of community-based patients with early stage chronic lymphocytic leukemia at presentation. Our effort to develop a revised scoring method meets the need to separate Binet stage A patients into different prognostic groups in order to devise individualized and tailored follow-up during the treatment-free period.","['Molica, Stefano', 'Mauro, Francesca R', 'Callea, Vincenzo', 'Giannarelli, Diana', 'Lauria, Francesco', 'Rotoli, Bruno', 'Cortelezzi, Agostino', 'Liso, Vincenzo', 'Foa, Robin']","['Molica S', 'Mauro FR', 'Callea V', 'Giannarelli D', 'Lauria F', 'Rotoli B', 'Cortelezzi A', 'Liso V', 'Foa R']","['Department of Hematology/Oncology, Azienda Ospedaliera Pugliese-Ciaccio, Viale Pio X 88100 Catanzaro, Italy. smolica@libero.it']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20091110,Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,,IM,"['Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*pathology/*therapy', 'Lymph Nodes/*pathology', 'Lymphocytosis/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Nomograms', 'Prognosis', 'Sex Factors', 'Time Factors']",2009/11/12 06:00,2010/07/09 06:00,['2009/11/12 06:00'],"['2009/11/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/11/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/07/09 06:00 [medline]']","['haematol.2009.011767 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.2009.011767 [doi]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2010 Mar;95(3):464-9. doi: 10.3324/haematol.2009.011767.

We hypothesized that protecting these immune cells from drug induced toxicities may allow for the combined administration of immunotherapy and chemotherapy. Using a SIV-based lentiviral gene transfer system we delivered the drug-resistant variant P140KMGMT into the immunocompetent cell lines NK-92 and TALL-104, and the myelogenous leukemia cell line, K562, which is a target for both NK-92 and TALL-104 cells. Genetically engineered immunocompetent cells developed significant resistance to temozolomide compared to non-modified cells, and genetic modification of these cells did not affect their ability to kill K562 cells. We then evaluated the effectiveness of drug-resistant immunocompetent cell mediated killing of tumor cells in the presence and absence of chemotherapy. During a chemotherapy challenge the cytotoxic activity of non-modified immunocompetent cells was dramatically impaired. However, when combined with chemotherapy, genetically-modified immune cells retained their cytotoxic activities and efficiently killed non-modified target cells. These results show that engineering immunocompetent cells to withstand chemotherapy challenges can enhance tumor cell killing when chemotherapy is applied in conjunction with cell-based immunotherapy.","['Dasgupta, Anindya', 'McCarty, David', 'Spencer, H Trent']","['Dasgupta A', 'McCarty D', 'Spencer HT']","['Department of Pediatrics, Aflac Cancer Center and Blood Disorders Service, Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, GA 30322, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20091110,United States,Biochem Biophys Res Commun,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,0372516,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '7GR28W0FJI (Dacarbazine)', 'EC 2.1.1.- (DNA Modification Methylases)', 'EC 2.1.1.63 (MGMT protein, human)', 'EC 6.5.1.- (DNA Repair Enzymes)', 'YF1K15M17Y (Temozolomide)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Cell Line, Tumor', '*Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'DNA Modification Methylases/*genetics', 'DNA Repair Enzymes/*genetics', 'Dacarbazine/adverse effects/analogs & derivatives/therapeutic use', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*genetics', '*Genetic Engineering', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy, Adoptive/*methods', 'Killer Cells, Natural/drug effects/*immunology/transplantation', 'Mice', 'Neoplasms/drug therapy/*therapy', 'Simian Immunodeficiency Virus/genetics', 'T-Lymphocytes/drug effects/*immunology/transplantation', 'Temozolomide', 'Transduction, Genetic', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/*genetics']",2009/11/12 06:00,2010/03/17 06:00,['2009/11/12 06:00'],"['2009/10/22 00:00 [received]', '2009/11/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/11/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/11/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/03/17 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-291X(09)02186-X [pii]', '10.1016/j.bbrc.2009.11.026 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Biophys Res Commun. 2010 Jan 1;391(1):170-5. doi: 10.1016/j.bbrc.2009.11.026.

RESULTS: We demonstrate that (i) the levels of ROS and a major product of oxidative stress (8-OHdG) are reduced, while the thioredoxin antioxidant protein is highly expressed in BLV-infected B lymphocytes, (ii) induction of ROS by valproate (VPA) is pro-apoptotic, (iii) inversely, the scavenging of ROS with N-acetylcysteine inhibits apoptosis, and finally (iv) the levels of ROS inversely correlate with the proviral loads. CONCLUSION: Together, these observations underline the importance of ROS in the mechanisms of inhibition of apoptosis linked to BLV infection.","['Bouzar, Amel Baya', 'Boxus, Mathieu', 'Florins, Arnaud', 'Francois, Carole', 'Reichert, Michal', 'Willems, Luc']","['Bouzar AB', 'Boxus M', 'Florins A', 'Francois C', 'Reichert M', 'Willems L']","['Universite de Liege (ULg), Gembloux Agro-Bio Tech, Molecular and Cellular Biology, Gembloux, Belgium. bouzar.a@fsagx.ac.be']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20091110,England,Retrovirology,Retrovirology,101216893,"['0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '52500-60-4 (Thioredoxins)']",IM,"['Animals', '*Apoptosis', 'B-Lymphocytes/*virology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Leukemia Virus, Bovine/growth & development/*immunology', 'Proviruses/growth & development/*immunology', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/*immunology', 'Sheep', 'Thioredoxins/*biosynthesis']",2009/11/12 06:00,2010/01/14 06:00,['2009/11/12 06:00'],"['2009/05/28 00:00 [received]', '2009/11/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/11/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/11/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/01/14 06:00 [medline]']","['1742-4690-6-102 [pii]', '10.1186/1742-4690-6-102 [doi]']",epublish,Retrovirology. 2009 Nov 10;6:102. doi: 10.1186/1742-4690-6-102.,6,,,PMC2779800,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In recent years, narrowband ultraviolet B (NB-UVB, 311-313 nm) has been found to be a beneficial adjuvant treatment in patients refractory to first-line immunosuppressive drugs. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study is to analyse retrospectively the clinical outcome of 10 GVHD paediatric patients treated with NB-UVB therapy. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Ten paediatric patients (six girls and four boys: median age 12.5 years, range 4-20) with cutaneous GVHD were enrolled in the study: five patients with chronic GVHD and five patients with an overlap syndrome GVHD. All patients had already been shown to be resistant to first-choice immunosuppressive protocols, and were treated with NB-UVB phototherapy until a clinical remission of skin lesions occurred. RESULTS: A complete response (absence of lesions) was achieved in 80% of the cases (eight patients) after a median number of 29 treatments, corresponding to a median of 7.5 weeks (52 days) of treatment (range 3-13 weeks), with an average cumulative dose of 28.71 J cm(-2) (range 1.02-70.38 J cm(-2)). Only two patients reported a partial remission (< 18% of body surface area involved). During the follow-up period, a complete remission after 1 year was observed in 75% of patients and after 2 years in 71% of the evaluable patients. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides evidence that NB-UVB phototherapy represents a valid second-line treatment in paediatric patients affected by GVHD and refractory to immunosuppressive first-line treatment.","['Brazzelli, V', 'Grasso, V', 'Muzio, F', 'Moggio, E', 'Zecca, M', 'Locatelli, F', 'Borroni, G']","['Brazzelli V', 'Grasso V', 'Muzio F', 'Moggio E', 'Zecca M', 'Locatelli F', 'Borroni G']","['Department of Human and Hereditary Pathology, Institute of Dermatology, University of Pavia and Foundation IRCCS Policlinico San Matteo, Piazzale Golgi 2, 27100 Pavia, Italy. vbrazzelli@libero.it']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20091109,England,Br J Dermatol,The British journal of dermatology,0004041,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Anemia, Aplastic/therapy', 'Anemia, Dyserythropoietic, Congenital/therapy', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/*adverse effects', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Radiation', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease/pathology/*radiotherapy', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/therapy', 'Male', 'Remission Induction/methods', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Severity of Illness Index', 'Skin Diseases/pathology/*radiotherapy', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Ultraviolet Therapy/*methods', 'Young Adult']",2009/11/12 06:00,2010/05/27 06:00,['2009/11/12 06:00'],"['2009/11/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/11/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/05/27 06:00 [medline]']","['BJD9503 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1365-2133.2009.09503.x [doi]']",ppublish,Br J Dermatol. 2010 Feb 1;162(2):404-9. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2133.2009.09503.x.

In order to determine such early events of leukemogenesis, we have used a well established mouse model for CLL. Over-expression of human TCL1, a known CLL oncogene in murine B-cells leads to the development of mature CD19+/CD5+/IgM+ clonal leukemia with a disease phenotype similar to that seen in human CLL. Herein, we review our recent study using this TCL1-driven mouse model for CLL and corresponding human CLL samples in a cross-species epigenomics approach to address the timing and relevance of epigenetic events occurring during leukemogenesis. We demonstrated that the mouse model recapitulates the epigenetic events that have been reported for human CLL, affirming the power and validity of this mouse model to study early epigenetic events in cancer progression. Epigenetic alterations are detected as early as three months after birth, far before disease manifests at about 11 months of age. These mice undergo NFkappaB repressor complex mediated inactivation of the transcription factor Foxd3, whose targets become aberrantly methylated and silenced in mouse and human CLL. Overall, our data suggest the accumulated epigenetic alterations during CLL pathogenesis as a consequence of gene silencing through TCL1 and NFkappaB repressor complex, suggesting the relevance for NFkappaB as a therapeutic target in CLL.","['Chen, Shih-Shih', 'Sherman, Mara H', 'Hertlein, Erin', 'Johnson, Amy J', 'Teitell, Michael A', 'Byrd, John C', 'Plass, Christoph']","['Chen SS', 'Sherman MH', 'Hertlein E', 'Johnson AJ', 'Teitell MA', 'Byrd JC', 'Plass C']","['Laboratory of Experimental Immunology, Feinstein Institute for Medical Research, Manhasset, NY, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",,United States,Cell Cycle,"Cell cycle (Georgetown, Tex.)",101137841,"['0 (Forkhead Transcription Factors)', '0 (Foxd3 protein, mouse)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (TCL1A protein, human)']",IM,"['Animals', 'B-Lymphocytes/*metabolism', '*Disease Models, Animal', 'Epigenesis, Genetic/genetics/*physiology', 'Forkhead Transcription Factors/metabolism', 'Gene Silencing', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*genetics/metabolism', 'Mice', 'NF-kappa B/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*metabolism', 'Repressor Proteins/metabolism']",2009/11/11 06:00,2010/03/02 06:00,['2009/11/11 06:00'],"['2009/11/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/11/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/03/02 06:00 [medline]']","['9957 [pii]', '10.4161/cc.8.22.9957 [doi]']",ppublish,Cell Cycle. 2009 Nov 15;8(22):3663-7. doi: 10.4161/cc.8.22.9957.,8,"['P30 CA016058-34S39030/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA90571/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA016058-349030/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA101956/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA101956-040002/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA016058-319030/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA101956-020002/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'A101956/PHS HHS/United States', 'P01 CA081534/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA016058-339030/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 CA009338/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA101956-01A20002/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA101956-030002/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA81534/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA016058-329030/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA16058/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA016058-309030/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R21 CA110496/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA016058-34S29030/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA016058/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA110496/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,PMC2871675,['NIHMS194417'],34,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The molecules most likely causing such alterations are neurotrophins (NTs) and/or related neurokines. In several species, including humans, lower airway parasympathetic postganglionic neurons that project axons to airway smooth muscle are either cholinergic or nonadrenergic noncholinergic (NANC), the latter synthesizing vasoactive intestinal peptide and nitric oxide, but not acetylcholine. In guinea pig trachealis smooth muscle, cholinergic nerve terminals arise from ganglionic neurons located near the tracheal smooth muscle, whereas the source of NANC nerve fibers is from neurons in ganglia located in the adjacent myenteric plexus of the esophagus, making this an ideal species to study regulation of parasympathetic neurotransmitter phenotypes. In the present study, we determined that, 48 hours after repeated allergen challenge, the NANC phenotype of airway parasympathetic ganglionic neurons changed to a cholinergic phenotype, and NT-3 mimicked this change. Nerve growth factor, brain-derived neurotrophic factor, leukemia inhibitory factor, or IL-1beta had no effect on either phenotype, and they did not induce these neurons to synthesize substance P or tyrosine hydroxylase. These results indicate a role for inflammation and NT-3 in regulating biochemical and anatomical characteristics of principal neurons in adult airway parasympathetic ganglia.","['Pan, Jenny', 'Rhode, Holly K', 'Undem, Bradley J', 'Myers, Allen C']","['Pan J', 'Rhode HK', 'Undem BJ', 'Myers AC']","['Division of Allergy and Clinical Immunology, the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD 21224, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20091109,United States,Am J Respir Cell Mol Biol,American journal of respiratory cell and molecular biology,8917225,"['0 (Allergens)', '0 (Neurotransmitter Agents)', '0 (Neurotrophin 3)']",IM,"['Allergens/*immunology', 'Animals', 'Esophagus/innervation/pathology', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Frozen Sections', 'Guinea Pigs', 'Lung/*immunology/*innervation', 'Male', 'Neurons/immunology/*metabolism/pathology', 'Neurotransmitter Agents/*metabolism', 'Neurotrophin 3/*metabolism', 'Parasympathetic Nervous System/immunology/*metabolism/pathology', 'Pneumonia/immunology/pathology']",2009/11/11 06:00,2010/10/20 06:00,['2009/11/11 06:00'],"['2009/11/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/11/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/10/20 06:00 [medline]']","['2009-0130OC [pii]', '10.1165/rcmb.2009-0130OC [doi]']",ppublish,Am J Respir Cell Mol Biol. 2010 Oct;43(4):452-7. doi: 10.1165/rcmb.2009-0130OC.

A strong antiviral response to the viral surface glycoprotein (SU) was noted in both natural and experimental infections. In addition, 143 of 226 FIV-infected animals (63%) also expressed antibodies to the primary binding receptor, CD134, whereas cats infected with other feline RNA viruses, including calicivirus, coronavirus, herpesvirus, and feline leukemia virus, did not. Both affinity-purified anti-CD134 and anti-SU antibodies blocked FIV infection ex vivo. FACS analyses revealed that the anti-CD134 antibodies bound to a cryptic epitope on the receptor that was only exposed when SU bound to CD134. Anti-CD134 binding caused displacement of SU from the surface of the cell and inhibition of infection. The presence of antibodies to CD134 correlated with lower virus loads and a better overall health status in FIV(+) cats, whereas anti-SU antibodies were present independent of health status. The findings are consistent with a role for antireceptor antibodies in protection from virus spread and disease progression.","['Grant, Chris K', 'Fink, Elizabeth A', 'Sundstrom, Magnus', 'Torbett, Bruce E', 'Elder, John H']","['Grant CK', 'Fink EA', 'Sundstrom M', 'Torbett BE', 'Elder JH']","['Custom Monoclonals International, West Sacramento, CA 95691, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",20091109,United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (Autoantibodies)', '0 (Receptors, OX40)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Autoantibodies/*immunology', 'Cats', 'Cell Line', '*Feline Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome/blood/immunology/physiopathology', 'Humans', 'Immunodeficiency Virus, Feline/*immunology/physiology', 'Receptors, OX40/*immunology', 'Survival Rate', 'T-Lymphocytes/cytology/immunology', 'Viral Load', '*Virus Internalization']",2009/11/11 06:00,2010/01/15 06:00,['2009/11/11 06:00'],"['2009/11/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/11/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/01/15 06:00 [medline]']","['0911307106 [pii]', '10.1073/pnas.0911307106 [doi]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2009 Nov 24;106(47):19980-5. doi: 10.1073/pnas.0911307106.

Infection has been associated with immunosuppression and decreased productivity. Cases of tuberculosis in cows due to infection with Mycobacterium bovis reemerged in Michigan in 1998, and despite intensive eradication attempts, new cases of bovine tuberculosis are sporadically identified. The present report details a coinfection with BLV and M. bovis in a Holstein cow from Michigan that presented as part of a bovine tuberculosis screening program. Peripheral and visceral lymph nodes of this animal were markedly enlarged, homogeneously pale white, and bulged on the cut surface. The submandibular, mesenteric, and caudal mediastinal lymph nodes contained multifocal to coalescing caseogranulomas that ranged from 1 to 5 cm in diameter. Histologically, dense sheets of monomorphic populations of neoplastic lymphocytes obliterated the normal architecture of all lymph nodes. Caseogranulomas were characterized by central pools of amorphous degenerate eosinophilic and occasionally mineralized granular debris surrounded by thick rims of epithelioid macrophages, occasional Langhan's type giant cells, and fibrosis. Polymerase chain reaction assay was positive for BLV. Cultures of affected lymph nodes yielded growth of M. bovis.","['Fitzgerald, Scott D', 'Sledge, Dodd G', 'Maes, Roger', 'Wise, Annabel', 'Kiupel, Matti']","['Fitzgerald SD', 'Sledge DG', 'Maes R', 'Wise A', 'Kiupel M']","['Michigan State University, Diagnostic Center for Population and Animal Health, Lansing, MI 48910-8107, USA.

Using the axotrophin/MARCH-7 null mouse, we discovered profound effects on T lymphocyte responses, including 8-fold hyperproliferation and 5-fold excess release of the stem cell cytokine leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF). Our further discovery that axotrophin/MARCH-7 is required for targeted degradation of the LIF receptor subunit gp190 implies a direct role in the regulation of LIF signaling. Bioinformatics studies revealed a highly conserved RING-CH domain in common with the MARCH family of E3-ubiquitin ligases, and accordingly, axotrophin was renamed ""MARCH-7."" To probe protein expression of human axotrophin/MARCH-7, we prepared antibodies against different domains of the protein. Each antibody bound its specific target epitope with high affinity, and immunohistochemistry cross-validated target specificity. Forty-eight human tissue types were screened. Epithelial cells stained strongly, with trophoblasts having the greatest staining. In certain tissues, specific cell types were selectively positive, including neurons and neuronal progenitor cells in the hippocampus and cerebellum, endothelial sinusoids of the spleen, megakaryocytes in the bone marrow, crypt stem cells of the small intestine, and alveolar macrophages in the lung. Approximately 20% of central nervous system neuropils were positive. Notably, axotrophin/MARCH-7 has an expression profile that is distinct from that of other MARCH family members.

However, optimal sampling intervals have not been defined and are likely to vary according to the underlying molecular lesion. In 74 patients experiencing hematologic relapse and harboring aberrations amenable to RQ-PCR (mutated NPM1 [designated NPM1c], PML-RARA, RUNX1-RUNX1T1, and CBFB-MYH11), we observed strikingly different relapse kinetics. The median doubling time of the CBFB-MYH11 leukemic clone was significantly longer (36 days) than that of clones harboring other markers (RUNX1-RUNX1T1, 14 days; PML-RARA, 12 days; and NPM1c, 11 days; P < .001). Furthermore, we used a mathematical model to determine frequency of relapse detection and median time from detection of minimal residual disease to hematologic relapse as a function of sampling interval length. For example, to obtain a relapse detection fraction of 90% and a median time of 60 days, blood sampling every sixth month should be performed for CBFB-MYH11 leukemias. By contrast, in NPM1c(+)/FLT3-ITD(-), NPM1c(+)/FLT3-ITD(+), RUNX1-RUNX1T1, and PML-RARA leukemias, bone marrow sampling is necessary every sixth, fourth, and fourth and second month, respectively. These data carry important implications for the development of optimal RQ-PCR monitoring schedules suitable for evaluation of minimal residual disease-directed therapies in future clinical trials.","['Ommen, Hans Beier', 'Schnittger, Susanne', 'Jovanovic, Jelena V', 'Ommen, Ingrid Beier', 'Hasle, Henrik', 'Ostergaard, Mette', 'Grimwade, David', 'Hokland, Peter']","['Ommen HB', 'Schnittger S', 'Jovanovic JV', 'Ommen IB', 'Hasle H', 'Ostergaard M', 'Grimwade D', 'Hokland P']","['Laboratory of Immunohematology, Department of Hematology, Aarhus University Hospital, Aarhus, Denmark.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20091109,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (AML1-ETO fusion protein, human)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (CBFB protein, human)', '0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (Core Binding Factor beta Subunit)', '0 (MYH11 protein, human)', '0 (NPM1 protein, human)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (RUNX1 Translocation Partner 1 Protein)', '0 (promyelocytic leukemia-retinoic acid receptor alpha fusion oncoprotein)', '117896-08-9 (Nucleophosmin)', 'EC 3.6.4.1 (Myosin Heavy Chains)']",IM,"['Biomarkers, Tumor/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Bone Marrow/metabolism', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Core Binding Factor beta Subunit/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Female', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/*metabolism/therapy', 'Male', 'Monitoring, Physiologic/methods', 'Myosin Heavy Chains/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Neoplasm, Residual', 'Nuclear Proteins/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Nucleophosmin', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'RUNX1 Translocation Partner 1 Protein', 'Recurrence', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Time Factors']",2009/11/11 06:00,2010/01/29 06:00,['2009/11/11 06:00'],"['2009/11/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/11/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/01/29 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)49350-4 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2009-04-212530 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2010 Jan 14;115(2):198-205. doi: 10.1182/blood-2009-04-212530.

Our aim was to identify the genetic basis of interindividual variability in methotrexate pharmacokinetics in children with newly diagnosed acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). PATIENTS AND METHODS: We performed a genome-wide analysis of 500,568 germline single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) to identify how inheritance affects methotrexate plasma disposition among 434 children with ALL who received 3,014 courses of methotrexate at 2 to 5 g/m(2). SNPs were validated in an independent cohort of 206 patients. RESULTS: Adjusting for age, race, sex, and methotrexate regimen, the most significant associations were with SNPs in the organic anion transporter polypeptide, SLCO1B1. Two SNPs in SLCO1B1, rs11045879 (P = 1.7 x 10(-10)) and rs4149081 (P = 1.7 x 10(-9)), were in linkage disequilibrium (LD) with each other (r(2) = 1) and with a functional polymorphism in SLCO1B1, T521C (rs4149056; r(2) > 0.84). rs11045879 and rs4149081 were validated in an independent cohort of 206 patients (P = .018 and P = .017), as were other SLCO1B1 SNPs residing in different LD blocks. SNPs in SLCO1B1 were also associated with GI toxicity (odds ratio, 15.3 to 16.4; P = .03 to .004). CONCLUSION: A genome-wide interrogation identified inherited variations in a plausible, yet heretofore low-priority candidate gene, SLCO1B1, as important determinants of methotrexate's pharmacokinetics and clinical effects.","['Trevino, Lisa R', 'Shimasaki, Noriko', 'Yang, Wenjian', 'Panetta, John C', 'Cheng, Cheng', 'Pei, Deqing', 'Chan, Diana', 'Sparreboom, Alex', 'Giacomini, Kathleen M', 'Pui, Ching-Hon', 'Evans, William E', 'Relling, Mary V']","['Trevino LR', 'Shimasaki N', 'Yang W', 'Panetta JC', 'Cheng C', 'Pei D', 'Chan D', 'Sparreboom A', 'Giacomini KM', 'Pui CH', 'Evans WE', 'Relling MV']","[""St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN 38105-2794, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20091109,United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Liver-Specific Organic Anion Transporter 1)', '0 (Organic Anion Transporters)', '0 (SLCO1B1 protein, human)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/adverse effects/blood/*pharmacokinetics', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Gastrointestinal Diseases/chemically induced/genetics', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genome-Wide Association Study', '*Germ-Line Mutation', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Linear Models', 'Linkage Disequilibrium', 'Liver-Specific Organic Anion Transporter 1', 'Logistic Models', 'Male', 'Methotrexate/adverse effects/blood/*pharmacokinetics', 'Organic Anion Transporters/*genetics/metabolism', 'Phenotype', '*Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/genetics/metabolism', 'Prospective Studies', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Treatment Outcome']",2009/11/11 06:00,2009/12/25 06:00,['2009/11/11 06:00'],"['2009/11/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/11/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2009/12/25 06:00 [medline]']","['JCO.2008.20.4156 [pii]', '10.1200/JCO.2008.20.4156 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2009 Dec 10;27(35):5972-8. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2008.20.4156.

Recurrent UPD11q led to identification of homozygous mutations in c-Cbl, an E3 ubiquitin ligase involved in attenuation of proliferative signals transduced by activated receptor tyrosine kinases. We examined the role and frequency of Cbl gene family mutations in MPN and related conditions. METHODS: We applied high-density SNP-A karyotyping to identify loss of heterozygosity of 11q in 442 patients with MDS, MDS/MPN, MPN, sAML evolved from these conditions, and primary AML. We sequenced c-Cbl, Cbl-b, and Cbl-c in patients with or without corresponding UPD or deletions and correlated mutational status with clinical features and outcomes. RESULTS: We identified c-Cbl mutations in 5% and 9% of patients with chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) and sAML, and also in CML blast crisis and juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia (JMML). Most mutations were homozygous and affected c-Cbl; mutations in Cbl-b were also found in patients with similar clinical features. Patients with Cbl family mutations showed poor prognosis, with a median survival of 5 months. Pathomorphologic features included monocytosis, monocytoid blasts, aberrant expression of phosphoSTAT5, and c-kit overexpression. Serial studies showed acquisition of c-Cbl mutations during malignant evolution. CONCLUSION: Mutations in the Cbl family RING finger domain or linker sequence constitute important pathogenic lesions associated with not only preleukemic CMML, JMML, and other MPN, but also progression to AML, suggesting that impairment of degradation of activated tyrosine kinases constitutes an important cancer mechanism.","['Makishima, Hideki', 'Cazzolli, Heather', 'Szpurka, Hadrian', 'Dunbar, Andrew', 'Tiu, Ramon', 'Huh, Jungwon', 'Muramatsu, Hideki', ""O'Keefe, Christine"", 'Hsi, Eric', 'Paquette, Ronald L', 'Kojima, Seiji', 'List, Alan F', 'Sekeres, Mikkael A', 'McDevitt, Michael A', 'Maciejewski, Jaroslaw P']","['Makishima H', 'Cazzolli H', 'Szpurka H', 'Dunbar A', 'Tiu R', 'Huh J', 'Muramatsu H', ""O'Keefe C"", 'Hsi E', 'Paquette RL', 'Kojima S', 'List AF', 'Sekeres MA', 'McDevitt MA', 'Maciejewski JP']","['Taussig Cancer Institute/R40, 9500 Euclid Ave, Cleveland OH 44195, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20091109,United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,['EC 2.3.2.27 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-cbl)'],IM,"['Chromosomes, Human, Pair 11', 'Frameshift Mutation', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Karyotyping', 'Multivariate Analysis', '*Mutation', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/*enzymology/*genetics/pathology', 'Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-cbl/*genetics/metabolism', 'Uniparental Disomy/genetics']",2009/11/11 06:00,2010/01/22 06:00,['2009/11/11 06:00'],"['2009/11/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/11/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/01/22 06:00 [medline]']","['JCO.2009.23.7503 [pii]', '10.1200/JCO.2009.23.7503 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2009 Dec 20;27(36):6109-16. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2009.23.7503.

We hypothesized that anthracycline use may increase aortic stiffness, a known predictor of CV events. PATIENTS AND METHODS We performed a prospective, case-control study involving 53 patients: 40 individuals who received an anthracycline for the treatment of breast cancer, lymphoma, or leukemia (cases), and 13 age- and sex-matched controls. Each participant underwent phase-contrast cardiovascular magnetic resonance measures of pulse wave velocity (PWV) and aortic distensibility (AoD) in the thoracic aorta at baseline, and 4 months after initiation of chemotherapy. Four one-way analyses of covariance models were fit in which factors known to influence thoracic aortic stiffness were included as covariates in the models. Results At the 4-month follow-up visit, aortic stiffness remained similar to baseline in the control participants. However, in the participants receiving anthracyclines, aortic stiffness increased markedly (relative to baseline), as evidenced by a decrease in AoD (P < .0001) and an increase in PWV (P < .0001). These changes in aortic stiffness persisted after accounting for age, sex, cardiac output, administered cardioactive medications, and underlying clinical conditions known to influence aortic stiffness, such as hypertension or diabetes (P < .0001). CONCLUSION A significant increase in aortic stiffness occurs within 4 months of exposure to an anthracycline which was not seen in an untreated control group. These results indicate that previously regarded cardiotoxic cancer therapy adversely increases thoracic aortic stiffness, a known independent predictor of adverse cardiovascular events.","['Chaosuwannakit, Narumol', ""D'Agostino, Ralph Jr"", 'Hamilton, Craig A', 'Lane, Kimberly S', 'Ntim, William O', 'Lawrence, Julia', 'Melin, Susan A', 'Ellis, Leslie R', 'Torti, Frank M', 'Little, William C', 'Hundley, W Gregory']","['Chaosuwannakit N', ""D'Agostino R Jr"", 'Hamilton CA', 'Lane KS', 'Ntim WO', 'Lawrence J', 'Melin SA', 'Ellis LR', 'Torti FM', 'Little WC', 'Hundley WG']","['Wake Forest University Health Sciences, Bowman Gray Campus, Medical Center Blvd, Winston-Salem, North Carolina 27157-1045, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20091109,United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,['0 (Anthracyclines)'],IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Anthracyclines/*adverse effects', 'Aorta/*drug effects/physiology', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prospective Studies']",2009/11/11 06:00,2010/01/08 06:00,['2009/11/11 06:00'],"['2009/11/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/11/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/01/08 06:00 [medline]']","['JCO.2009.23.8527 [pii]', '10.1200/JCO.2009.23.8527 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2010 Jan 1;28(1):166-72. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2009.23.8527.

A hallmark of ALT cells is the recruitment of telomeres to promyelocytic leukemia (PML) bodies and formation of ALT-associated PML bodies (APBs). Although the exact molecular mechanism of APBs assembly remains unclear, APBs assembly requires telomere and PML body-associated proteins, including TRF1 and PML. Here, we report that PML3, one of PML isoforms, is involved in APBs formation. As a new binding protein of TRF1 (telomeric repeat binding factor 1), PML3 directly interacts with TRF1 and recruits TRF1 to PML bodies in U2OS cells. More notably, depletion of PML3 by small interfering RNA does not affect PML bodies formation, but inhibits the recruitment of both TRF1 and TRF2 to APBs. Further study shows that the recruitment of TRF1 to APBs depends on its interaction with a specific PML3 isoform. Thus, the interaction of PML3 with TRF1 is isoform specific and likely to be essential for APBs assembly in U2OS cells.","['Yu, Jian', 'Lan, Jianping', 'Wang, Chong', 'Wu, Quan', 'Zhu, Yuanyuan', 'Lai, Xiaoyu', 'Sun, Jie', 'Jin, Changjiang', 'Huang, He']","['Yu J', 'Lan J', 'Wang C', 'Wu Q', 'Zhu Y', 'Lai X', 'Sun J', 'Jin C', 'Huang H']","['The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University Medical School, Hangzhou 310003, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20091108,Ireland,Cancer Lett,Cancer letters,7600053,"['0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Telomeric Repeat Binding Protein 1)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)', 'EC 2.5.1.18 (Glutathione Transferase)']",IM,"['Cell Cycle', 'DNA, Complementary/genetics', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Glutathione Transferase/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Microsatellite Repeats', 'Nuclear Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Palatine Tonsil/metabolism', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'Protein Binding', 'RNA, Small Interfering/genetics', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/metabolism', 'Recombinant Proteins/metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Telomeric Repeat Binding Protein 1/*genetics/metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/genetics/*metabolism']",2009/11/11 06:00,2010/04/24 06:00,['2009/11/11 06:00'],"['2009/05/17 00:00 [received]', '2009/10/11 00:00 [revised]', '2009/10/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/11/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/11/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/04/24 06:00 [medline]']","['S0304-3835(09)00631-4 [pii]', '10.1016/j.canlet.2009.10.009 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Lett. 2010 May 28;291(2):177-86. doi: 10.1016/j.canlet.2009.10.009.

The investigation was a hospital-based case-control study consisting of 722 newly diagnosed AML cases (August 2003 through June 2007) and 1444 individually gender-age-matched patient controls at 29 hospitals in Shanghai. A 17-page questionnaire was used to obtain information on demographics, medical history, family history, lifestyle risk factors, employment history, residential history, and occupational and non-occupational exposures. Certain occupations of interest triggered a second questionnaire, which was occupation-specific and asked for more details about jobs, tasks, materials used and work environment. Exposure assessments were based on the questionnaires, on-site workplace investigations, data published in the Chinese literature, historical exposure measurements maintained by government health agencies, and expert opinions of a panel of local scientists who were familiar with workplaces in Shanghai. Risk estimates (odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals) of individual risk factors were calculated using conditional logistic regression models. A number of potential environmental and occupational risk factors were associated with an increased risk of AML (all subtypes combined) and/or individual subtypes; including home or workplace renovation, living on a farm, planting crops, raising livestock or animals, farm workers, metal workers, rubber and plastic workers, wood and furniture workers, printers, loading and unloading workers, automobile manufacturing, general construction, and food and beverage industry (restaurants and other eateries). Exposures associated with an increased risk of AML (all subtypes combined) and/or individual subtypes included benzene, diesel fuel, metals, insecticides, fertilizers, glues and adhesives, paints and other coatings, and inks and pigments. Multivariate models were used to adjust for potential confounding exposures, and several potential risk factors were subsequently eliminated. The results of the investigation indicated that some risk factors applied to all or most subtypes (e.g., living on a farm and overall AML and several subtypes), while others to specific subtypes only (e.g., raising livestock and AML with multilineage dysplasia). Thus, some risk factors were subtype-specific. The difference in risk by subtype underscores the importance of the etiologic commonality and heterogeneity of AML subtypes.","['Wong, Otto', 'Harris, Fran', 'Armstrong, Thomas W', 'Hua, Fu']","['Wong O', 'Harris F', 'Armstrong TW', 'Hua F']","['Applied Health Sciences, San Mateo, CA 94401, USA. ottowong@aol.com']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20091110,Ireland,Chem Biol Interact,Chemico-biological interactions,0227276,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Case-Control Studies', 'China/epidemiology', 'Environmental Exposure/adverse effects/*analysis', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*epidemiology/etiology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Occupational Exposure/adverse effects/*analysis', 'Risk Factors', 'World Health Organization']",2009/11/11 06:00,2010/04/24 06:00,['2009/11/11 06:00'],"['2009/09/22 00:00 [received]', '2009/10/26 00:00 [revised]', '2009/10/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2009/11/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/11/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2010/04/24 06:00 [medline]']","['S0009-2797(09)00468-2 [pii]', '10.1016/j.cbi.2009.10.017 [doi]']",ppublish,Chem Biol Interact. 2010 Mar 19;184(1-2):112-28. doi: 10.1016/j.cbi.2009.10.017.
