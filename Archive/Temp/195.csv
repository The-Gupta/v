It can follow inflammatory skin diseases of several types, and occasionally is present in the skin around neoplasms. There are a few reports of anetoderma in the lesional skin of cutaneous lymphoma. We report on two patients who presented with multiple lesions of anetoderma and who later proved to have low-grade cutaneous B-cell lymphomas. One patient (Patient 1) is a 39-year-old man and the other patient is a 26-year-old woman who is a renal transplant recipient (Patient 2). Some biopsy specimens from the anetodermic skin of Patient 1 appeared to show an urticarial reaction, although plasma cells were present. A large nodule showed lymphoid follicles surrounded by plasmacytoid lymphocytes, with loss of elastic tissue in the adjacent dermis. The plasmacytoid cells stained overwhelmingly for lambda light chain, and staining of the urticarial lesions from this patient also showed a marked majority of lambda positive cells. Immunoglobulin heavy chain gene (IgH) rearrangements showed a dominant clonal pattern in the nodular lesion. We classified the disease in Patient 1 as marginal zone lymphoma and the disease in Patient 2 as a post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder. Because of the intimate association of anetoderma and cutaneous B-cell lymphoproliferative disorders in these two patients, it seems possible that anetoderma could result from either a local effect of the neoplastic cells or associated inflammatory cells, especially neutrophils as in Case 1. The infiltrates of Case 1 had many interstitial neutrophils and only a few clonal plasmacytoid lymphocytes, indicating that this presentation of B-cell lymphoma can be a diagnostic pitfall. Given these two cases and similar ones in the literature, biopsy of lesional skin in anetoderma should be performed to ensure that lymphomatous infiltrates are not present. Even if plasma cells are sparse, studies to detect clonality are appropriate. Cutaneous B-cell lymphoma can be added to the list of associations of elastolysis and cutaneous lymphoma, which includes granulomatous slack skin (T-cell lymphoma) and cutis laxa (myeloma).","['Kasper, R C', 'Wood, G S', 'Nihal, M', 'LeBoit, P E']","['Kasper RC', 'Wood GS', 'Nihal M', 'LeBoit PE']","['Department of Pathology, University of California, San Francisco 94115, USA.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",United States,Am J Dermatopathol,The American Journal of dermatopathology,7911005,"['0 (Epstein-Barr virus encoded RNA 1)', '0 (RNA, Viral)', '83HN0GTJ6D (Cyclosporine)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'I223NX31W9 (Fluorescein-5-isothiocyanate)', 'WM0HAQ4WNM (Tacrolimus)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Atrophy/pathology', 'Cutis Laxa/etiology/genetics/metabolism/*pathology', 'Cyclosporine/adverse effects', 'DNA/analysis', 'Elastic Tissue/pathology', 'Female', 'Fluorescein-5-isothiocyanate', 'Gene Rearrangement, B-Lymphocyte, Heavy Chain', 'Herpesvirus 4, Human/genetics/isolation & purification', 'Humans', 'Immunocompromised Host', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'In Situ Hybridization', 'Kidney Transplantation/adverse effects', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/chemistry/complications/genetics/*pathology', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/chemistry/complications/genetics/*pathology', 'Lymphoproliferative Disorders/complications/*pathology/virology', 'Male', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'RNA, Viral/analysis', 'Skin Neoplasms/chemistry/complications/genetics/*pathology', 'Tacrolimus/adverse effects']",,2001/04/04 10:00,2001/06/22 10:01,['2001/04/04 10:00'],"['2001/04/04 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/06/22 10:01 [medline]', '2001/04/04 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Am J Dermatopathol. 2001 Apr;23(2):124-32. doi: 10.1097/00000372-200104000-00007.,,,['10.1097/00000372-200104000-00007 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

CNTF functional responses are mediated through a tripartite membrane receptor composed of two signalling receptor chains, gp130 and the leukaemia inhibitory factor receptor (LIFR), associated with a non-signalling CNTF binding receptor alpha component (CNTFR). CNTFR-deficient mice show profound neuronal deficits at birth, leading to a lethal phenotype. In contrast, inactivation of the CNTF gene leads only to a slight muscle weakness, mainly during adulthood, suggesting that CNTFR binds to a second ligand that is important for development. Modelling studies of the interleukin-6 family member cardiotrophin-like cytokine (CLC) revealed structural similarities with CNTF, including the conservation of a site I domain involved in binding to CNTFR. Co-expression of CLC and CNTFR in mammalian cells generates a secreted composite cytokine, displaying activities on cells expressing the gp130-LIFR complex on their surface. Correspondingly, CLC-CNTFR activates gp130, LIFR and STAT3 signalling components, and enhances motor neuron survival. Together, these observations demonstrate that CNTFR induces the secretion of CLC, as well as mediating the functional responses of CLC.","['Plun-Favreau, H', 'Elson, G', 'Chabbert, M', 'Froger, J', 'deLapeyriere, O', 'Lelievre, E', 'Guillet, C', 'Hermann, J', 'Gauchat, J F', 'Gascan, H', 'Chevalier, S']","['Plun-Favreau H', 'Elson G', 'Chabbert M', 'Froger J', 'deLapeyriere O', 'Lelievre E', 'Guillet C', 'Hermann J', 'Gauchat JF', 'Gascan H', 'Chevalier S']","[""INSERM EMI 9928, CHU d'Angers, 4 Rue Larrey, 49033 Angers Cedex, France.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,EMBO J,The EMBO journal,8208664,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (IL6ST protein, human)', '0 (Il6st protein, mouse)', '0 (LIFR protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor Receptor alpha Subunit)', '0 (Lifr protein, mouse)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Receptor, Ciliary Neurotrophic Factor)', '0 (Receptors, Cytokine)', '0 (Receptors, OSM-LIF)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT3 protein, human)', '0 (Stat3 protein, mouse)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (cardiotrophin-like cytokine)', '133483-10-0 (Cytokine Receptor gp130)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Antigens, CD/metabolism', 'Binding Sites', 'COS Cells', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Membrane/metabolism', 'Cell Survival', 'Chlorocebus aethiops', 'Cytokine Receptor gp130', 'Cytokines/chemistry/genetics/metabolism/*physiology', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/metabolism', 'Dimerization', 'Humans', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor Receptor alpha Subunit', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Models, Molecular', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Motor Neurons', 'Protein Structure, Secondary', 'Receptor, Ciliary Neurotrophic Factor/*metabolism/physiology', 'Receptors, Cytokine/metabolism', 'Receptors, OSM-LIF', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/chemistry/genetics/metabolism/physiology', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor', 'Signal Transduction/physiology', 'Trans-Activators/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,2001/04/04 10:00,2001/06/19 10:01,['2001/04/04 10:00'],"['2001/04/04 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/06/19 10:01 [medline]', '2001/04/04 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,EMBO J. 2001 Apr 2;20(7):1692-703. doi: 10.1093/emboj/20.7.1692.,,,['10.1093/emboj/20.7.1692 [doi]'],PMC145510,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These arrests are required for efficient repair of DNA lesions, and employ several factors, including the product of the tumor suppressor gene p53 that plays a central role in the cellular response to DNA damage. p53 protein has a major function in the gamma-ray-induced cell cycle delay in G(1) phase. However, it remains uncertain as to whether p53 is also involved in the UV-mediated G(1) delay. This report provides evidence that p53 is not involved in UV-induced cellular growth arrest in late G(1) phase. This has been demonstrated in HeLa cells synchronized at the G(1)/S border by aphidicolin, followed by UV exposure. Interestingly, the length of this p53-independent G(1) arrest has been shown to be UV dose-dependent. Similar results were also obtained with other p53-deficient cell lines, including human promyelocytic leukemia HL-60 and mouse p53 knock-out cells. As expected, all of these cell lines were defective in gamma-ray-induced cell growth arrest at late G(1). Moreover, it is shown that in addition to cell cycle arrest, HL-60 cells undergo apoptosis in G(1) phase in response to UV light but not to gamma-rays. Together, these findings indicate that p53- compromised cells have a differential response following exposure to ionizing radiation or UV light.","['Al-Mohanna, M A', 'Al-Khodairy, F M', 'Krezolek, Z', 'Bertilsson, P A', 'Al-Houssein, K A', 'Aboussekhra, A']","['Al-Mohanna MA', 'Al-Khodairy FM', 'Krezolek Z', 'Bertilsson PA', 'Al-Houssein KA', 'Aboussekhra A']","['King Faisal Specialist Hospital and Research Center, Biological and Medical Research Department, MBC No. 03, PO Box 3354, Riyadh 11211, Saudi Arabia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Carcinogenesis,Carcinogenesis,8008055,['0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/radiation effects', 'Cell Cycle/*radiation effects', 'Cell Line', 'DNA Fragmentation', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Radiation', 'Flow Cytometry', 'G1 Phase/*radiation effects', 'Gamma Rays', 'HL-60 Cells', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Light', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Time Factors', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/*physiology', 'Ultraviolet Rays']",,2001/04/04 10:00,2001/05/22 10:01,['2001/04/04 10:00'],"['2001/04/04 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/05/22 10:01 [medline]', '2001/04/04 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Carcinogenesis. 2001 Apr;22(4):573-8. doi: 10.1093/carcin/22.4.573.,,,['10.1093/carcin/22.4.573 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In our study, we found that Se-methylselenocysteine (MSC) induced apoptosis through caspase activation in human promyelocytic leukemia (HL-60) cells. Measurements of cytotoxicity, DNA fragmentation and apoptotic morphology revealed that MSC was more efficient at inducing apoptosis than selenite, but was less toxic. Moreover, MSC increased both the apoptotic cleavage of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) and caspase-3 activity, whereas selenite did not. We next examined whether caspases and serine proteases are required for the apoptotic induction by MSC. A general caspase inhibitor, z-VAD-fmk, dramatically decreased cytotoxicity in MSC-treated HL-60 cells and several other apoptotic features, such as, caspase-3 activation, the apoptotic DNA ladder, TUNEL-positive staining and the DNA double-strand break. Interestingly, a general serine protease inhibitor, AAPV-cmk, also effectively inhibited MSC-mediated cytotoxicity and apoptosis. These results demonstrate that MSC is a selenocompound that efficiently induces apoptosis in leukemia cells and that proteolytic machinery, in particular caspase-3, is necessary for MSC-induced apoptosis. On the other hand, selenite-induced cell death could be derived from necrosis rather than apoptosis, since selenite did not significantly induce several apoptotic phenomena, including the activation of caspase-3.","['Kim, T', 'Jung, U', 'Cho, D Y', 'Chung, A S']","['Kim T', 'Jung U', 'Cho DY', 'Chung AS']","['Department of Biological Sciences, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Taejon 305-701, Korea.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Carcinogenesis,Carcinogenesis,8008055,"['0 (Amino Acid Chloromethyl Ketones)', '0 (Anticarcinogenic Agents)', '0 (Organoselenium Compounds)', '0 (benzyloxycarbonylvalyl-alanyl-aspartyl fluoromethyl ketone)', '0CH9049VIS (Selenocysteine)', 'EC 2.4.2.30 (Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'HIW548RQ3W (Sodium Selenite)', 'K848JZ4886 (Cysteine)', 'TWK220499Z (selenomethylselenocysteine)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Chloromethyl Ketones/metabolism', 'Anticarcinogenic Agents/*pharmacology', '*Apoptosis', 'Caspase 3', 'Caspases/*metabolism', 'Cysteine/*analogs & derivatives/*pharmacology', 'DNA Damage', 'DNA Fragmentation', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Enzyme Activation', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Immunoblotting', 'In Situ Nick-End Labeling', 'Organoselenium Compounds/*pharmacology', 'Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases/metabolism', 'Selenocysteine/analogs & derivatives', 'Sodium Selenite/pharmacology', 'Time Factors']",,2001/04/04 10:00,2001/05/22 10:01,['2001/04/04 10:00'],"['2001/04/04 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/05/22 10:01 [medline]', '2001/04/04 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Carcinogenesis. 2001 Apr;22(4):559-65. doi: 10.1093/carcin/22.4.559.,,,['10.1093/carcin/22.4.559 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The expression of LIF by these cells caused resistance to this cytokine due to loss of the LIF receptor (LIFR), from the cell surface, suggesting its retention. In contrast, cells expressing OSM were stimulated by this cytokine, utilizing an autocrine mechanism, and possessed receptors for OSM, but not LIF, on the cell surface. In these cells the continuous up-regulation of OSM-induced gene expression was found even though the Janus kinase-signal transducer and activator of transcription ('JAK/STAT') pathway was almost exhausted due to long-term autocrine stimulation of the cells by OSM. The amount of LIFR was down-regulated in both LIF- and OSM-producing cells and this effect was not found in wild-type U373-MG cells treated with externally added cytokines. To investigate the mechanism of autocrine stimulation by OSM we constructed a stable cell line expressing a form of OSM that is retained in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). This biologically active cytokine was not secreted, but was localized in the ER. In addition, it did not stimulate the astrocytoma cells in an autocrine manner. We conclude that expression of LIF causes resistance of astrocytoma cells to this cytokine, whereas expression of OSM leads to autocrine stimulation.","['Kasza, A', 'Rogowski, K', 'Kilarski, W', 'Sobota, R', 'Bernas, T', 'Dobrucki, J', 'Travis, J', 'Koj, A', 'Bugno, M', 'Kordula, T']","['Kasza A', 'Rogowski K', 'Kilarski W', 'Sobota R', 'Bernas T', 'Dobrucki J', 'Travis J', 'Koj A', 'Bugno M', 'Kordula T']","['Department of Animal Biochemistry, Institute of Molecular Biology, Jagiellonian University, 31-120 Krakow, Poland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Biochem J,The Biochemical journal,2984726R,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (IL6ST protein, human)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (LIFR protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor Receptor alpha Subunit)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (OSM protein, human)', '0 (Peptides)', '0 (Receptors, Cytokine)', '0 (Receptors, OSM-LIF)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '106956-32-5 (Oncostatin M)', '133483-10-0 (Cytokine Receptor gp130)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (JAK1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 1)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD/metabolism', 'Astrocytoma/*metabolism/pathology', 'Base Sequence', 'Cytokine Receptor gp130', 'DNA Primers', 'Endoplasmic Reticulum/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/physiology', 'Growth Inhibitors/*metabolism/physiology', 'Humans', '*Interleukin-6', 'Janus Kinase 1', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor Receptor alpha Subunit', 'Lymphokines/*metabolism/physiology', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/metabolism', 'Oncostatin M', 'Peptides/*metabolism/physiology', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/metabolism', 'Receptors, Cytokine/metabolism', 'Receptors, OSM-LIF', 'Transcription Factors/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,2001/04/04 10:00,2001/06/02 10:01,['2001/04/04 10:00'],"['2001/04/04 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/06/02 10:01 [medline]', '2001/04/04 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Biochem J. 2001 Apr 15;355(Pt 2):307-14. doi: 10.1042/0264-6021:3550307.,,,['10.1042/0264-6021:3550307 [doi]'],PMC1221740,['HL37090/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,

Although the relative importance of immunological factors in human reproduction remains controversial, substantial evidence suggests that human leukocyte antigens (HLA), antisperm antibodies, integrins, the leukaemia inhibitory factor (LIF), cytokines, antiphospholipid antibodies, endometrial adhesion factors, mucins (MUC1) and uterine natural killer cells contribute to reproductive failure. In contrast, fewer data support the roles of anti-trophoblast antibodies, anti-endometrial antibodies, T-cells, peripheral natural killer cells, anti-HLA antibodies, blocking antibodies and suppressor cells in reproductive failure. Although immunological factors involved in reproductive failure have been studied traditionally using assays for antibodies and/or antigens, detailed research on these factors demonstrates conflicting results in humans. Maternal and fetal immunology is also difficult to investigate in humans. For these reasons, molecular assays may serve as a valuable alternative to investigate how the immune system affects reproductive outcome. In Part I of this review, immunological factors involved in human reproductive failure are summarized and critically evaluated. Immunogenetic and interacting factors in human reproductive failure will be summarized and evaluated in Part II.","['Choudhury, S R', 'Knapp, L A']","['Choudhury SR', 'Knapp LA']","['Department of Biological Anthropology, University of Cambridge, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",England,Hum Reprod Update,Human reproduction update,9507614,,IM,"['Abortion, Spontaneous/*immunology', 'Embryo Implantation/immunology', 'Embryonic and Fetal Development/*immunology', 'Female', 'Fetal Death/*immunology', 'Germ Cells/immunology', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Pregnancy', 'Reproduction/*immunology']",272,2001/04/04 10:00,2001/07/27 10:01,['2001/04/04 10:00'],"['2001/04/04 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/07/27 10:01 [medline]', '2001/04/04 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Hum Reprod Update. 2001 Mar-Apr;7(2):113-34. doi: 10.1093/humupd/7.2.113.,,,['10.1093/humupd/7.2.113 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, clinical trial evidence of benefit is still awaited. The position is clearer in the case of neoadjuvant therapy because long-term follow up of two trials now shows that patients randomized to chemotherapy before surgery were significantly more likely to survive to 5 years than patients treated with surgery alone. Early data suggest that neoadjuvant chemotherapy based on docetaxel (Taxotere; Aventis, Antony, France) (possibly used sequentially with other agents) may be as effective as older regimens and better tolerated. Because p53 status influences the expression of microtubule-associated proteins and hence the sensitivity of a tumor to taxanes, it is possible that molecular markers could be used to customize chemotherapy to individual patients. Generally, it is becoming clearer that molecular staging is a more sensitive means of demonstrating tumor dissemination than light microscopy. The Cancer and Leukemia Group B is undertaking a prospective study using reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction to detect MUC-1 RNA in bone marrow and hilar and mediastinal lymph nodes removed at resection with the aim of distinguishing between stage I patients likely to remain disease-free for long periods and those at high risk of relapse. A study of small cell lung cancer is using automated fluorescence microscopy to detect keratin-positive cells in the marrow and blood of patients who have a complete response to initial therapy but are nevertheless at high overall risk of relapse. The identification of genetic lesions in a high proportion of patients with non-small cell lung cancer may guide the development of new therapies aimed at increasing rates of apoptosis among tumor cells.","['Rosell, R', 'Green, M', 'Gumerlock, P']","['Rosell R', 'Green M', 'Gumerlock P']","['Medical Oncology Service, Hospital Germans Trias i Pujol, Badalona, Barcelona, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Semin Oncol,Seminars in oncology,0420432,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Taxoids)', '15H5577CQD (Docetaxel)', 'P88XT4IS4D (Paclitaxel)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*metabolism', 'Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung/*metabolism/pathology/*therapy', 'Cell Cycle Proteins/metabolism', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Docetaxel', 'Humans', 'Lung Neoplasms/*metabolism/pathology/*therapy', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*metabolism', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Nuclear Proteins/metabolism', 'Paclitaxel/*analogs & derivatives/therapeutic use', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/metabolism', '*Taxoids']",34,2001/04/04 10:00,2001/04/17 10:01,['2001/04/04 10:00'],"['2001/04/04 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/04/17 10:01 [medline]', '2001/04/04 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Semin Oncol. 2001 Feb;28(1 Suppl 2):28-34.,,,['S0093-7754(01)90301-X [pii]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The dominant toxicity was esophagitis. Preliminary survival data are encouraging. Other trials in progress or planned will elucidate the relative contributions of induction and concurrent therapy to outcome. A phase I study has shown that it is feasible to combine docetaxel (Taxotere: Aventis, Antony, France) with concomitant radiotherapy in patients with advanced non-small cell lung or esophageal cancer. Giving the drug once every 3 weeks during standard radiotherapy, the maximum tolerated dose is 40 mg/m2 per cycle. The dose-limiting toxicities are neutropenia and esophagitis. However, it is possible to escalate the total docetaxel dose to 60 mg/m2 per cycle by weekly administration of 20 mg/m2. Beyond this point, esophagitis is dose limiting. In the palliative-intent treatment setting, the weekly administration of docetaxel is also likely to be a helpful new approach to administering the drug in subgroups of patients such as the elderly and those with concomitant disease. Weekly docetaxel (36 mg/m2/wk) was administered to patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer who were elderly (median age, 71 years) or had poor performance status. In this unfavorable group, weekly docetaxel produced a 19% objective response rate and with further follow-up, 1-year survival is 28%. This level of activity is similar to other single agents recently evaluated in more favorable patient groups. The lack of myelosuppression seen with weekly administration suggests that the dose intensity of docetaxel could be maintained in combination regimens.","['Hainsworth, J D', 'Vokes, E E']","['Hainsworth JD', 'Vokes EE']","['Sarah Cannon Cancer Center, Nashville, TN, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,Semin Oncol,Seminars in oncology,0420432,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Radiation-Sensitizing Agents)', '0 (Taxoids)', '15H5577CQD (Docetaxel)', 'P88XT4IS4D (Paclitaxel)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung/*drug therapy/radiotherapy', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Docetaxel', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Humans', 'Lung Neoplasms/*drug therapy/radiotherapy', 'Middle Aged', 'Paclitaxel/administration & dosage/*analogs & derivatives/*therapeutic use', 'Radiation-Sensitizing Agents/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', '*Taxoids']",25,2001/04/04 10:00,2001/04/17 10:01,['2001/04/04 10:00'],"['2001/04/04 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/04/17 10:01 [medline]', '2001/04/04 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Semin Oncol. 2001 Feb;28(1 Suppl 2):22-7.,,,['S0093-7754(01)90300-8 [pii]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This unusual sensitivity is the result of a deficiency in the mdr1a P-glycoprotein that normally contributes to a functional blood-brain barrier. Previous studies demonstrated a correlation between P-glycoprotein levels in the brain, intestine, testis, and placenta with an restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) pattern from DNA isolated from the animals. We have demonstrated that only P-glycoprotein derived from the mdr1a gene is deficient in these mice. In this article, we describe the genetic defect in the subpopulation of CF-1 mice resulting in an absence of P-glycoprotein. The data presented describes a reverse transcription--polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) protocol that specifically amplifies mdr1a mRNA from tissue and confirms that the P-glycoprotein defect results from a truncated mRNA with a deleted exon 23. Genomic amplification and sequencing of the intron between exon 22 and 23 in Pgp-deficient animals reveals an insertion of approximately 8.35 kb of DNA at the exon 23 intron--exon junction corresponding to a murine leukemia virus. This insertion results in the aberrant splicing of the mRNA and the loss of exon 23 during RNA processing.","['Pippert, T R', 'Umbenhauer, D R']","['Pippert TR', 'Umbenhauer DR']","['Department of Safety Assessment, Merck & Co., West Point, PA 19446, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Biochem Mol Toxicol,Journal of biochemical and molecular toxicology,9717231,"['0 (DNA Transposable Elements)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', '*DNA Transposable Elements', 'Exons', 'Gene Deletion', '*Genes, MDR', 'Mice/*genetics', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'RNA Splicing', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Retroviridae/*genetics', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Sequence Homology, Nucleic Acid']",,2001/04/03 10:00,2001/07/11 10:01,['2001/04/03 10:00'],"['2001/04/03 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/07/11 10:01 [medline]', '2001/04/03 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Biochem Mol Toxicol. 2001;15(2):83-9. doi: 10.1002/jbt.3.,,"['Copyright 2001 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

We detected duplication or amplification of chromosome band 11q23 with 3-7 copies of the MLL gene by fluorescence in situ hybridization in 12 out of 70 unselected patients with therapy-related myelodysplasia or acute myeloid leukemia (17%). In all but one case, the supernumerary copies of MLL were located to previously unidentified marker chromosomes or unbalanced translocations. In 4 of the 12 patients, 2-6 copies were located together on the same chromosome arm representing amplification, 7 patients had single, extra duplicated copies of MLL, whereas both amplification and duplication were observed in the same cell in 1 patient. Comparative genomic hybridization demonstrated gain of varying, often large parts of 11q in five patients. The MLL gene was shown to be unrearranged in all 12 patients. Seven out of eight patients with duplication or amplification of MLL had mutations of TP53. Patients with supernumerary copies of MLL were in general older (P = 0.007) and had a shorter survival (P < 0.001) compared to other patients. Duplication or amplification of MLL was significantly associated with a complex karyotype (P = 0.002), with deletion or loss of 5q (P = 0.001), and with prior therapy with alkylating agents.

The authors hypothesized that Florida's Hispanic children would have higher risks of lymphoma and lymphoid leukemia compared with non-Hispanic white children. METHODS: All cases of lymphoid leukemia, Hodgkin, non-Hodgkin, and Burkitt lymphoma (SEER International Classification of Diseases for Oncology codes) in children (< 15 years) in the Florida Cancer Data System (FCDS) from 1985 to 1997 were studied. Cases were classified as: 1) white, 2) Hispanic, or 3) black, and stratified by age. Age-adjusted rates for the three race-ethnic groups were calculated. Rates for Hispanics and blacks were compared with whites as standardized rate ratios (SRR) with 95% confidence intervals. RESULTS: Seven hundred thirty-one incident cases of pediatric lymphoma and 1231 cases of lymphoid leukemia were identified during the study period. For children with lymphoma, the SRR for Hispanics was 1.32 (95% CI, 1.20-1.44), and for blacks, the SRR was 0.68 (95% CI, 0.63-0.72. For lymphoid leukemia, the SRR for Hispanics was 1.29 (95% CI, 1.28-1.30), and for blacks, the SRR was 0.55 (95% CI, 0.54-0.56). Similar rates were found for the Hodgkin and non-Hodgkin subgroups. CONCLUSIONS: Incidences of Hodgkin and non-Hodgkin lymphoma were significantly higher in Florida's Hispanic children, with 30% increased relative risks, compared with whites. Black children had significantly decreased incidences and risk. Results for lymphoid leukemia were similar.

Eniluracil is a potent inactivator of DPD which results in 100% oral bioavailability of 5-FU. Leucovorin (LV) is another biochemical modulator of 5-FU that potentiates inhibition of thymidylate synthase, the primary target of 5-FU. The goal of this study was to determine the antitumor activity and toxicity of an oral regimen containing eniluracil, 5-FU, and LV in patients with colorectal carcinoma. METHODS: Sixty eligible patients who had previously untreated, measurable, metastatic colorectal carcinoma were treated with oral eniluracil 50 mg on Days 1-7, 5-FU 20 mg/m(2) on Days 2-6, and LV 50 mg on Days 2-6. Cycles were repeated at 28-day intervals. RESULTS: The overall response rate was 13% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 6, 25%), with 1 complete response and 7 partial responses. Three additional patients had partial responses that were not confirmed at subsequent evaluations. The median time to progression of disease was 4.4 months (95% CI = 3.45, 7.69) and the median survival time was 12.6 months (95% CI = 9.1, 14.75). Grade 3-5 toxicity (1 toxic death) occurred in 51 patients (85%). Grade 4 neutropenia occurred in 25 patients (42%), and 18 patients (30%) had Grade 3-4 diarrhea. Twenty-one patients (35%) were hospitalized for toxicity, and 12 (20%) had febrile neutropenia. Baseline creatinine clearance was associated inversely with severe toxicity (P = 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Although antitumor activity was observed, the frequent occurrence of severe toxicity with this regimen limited its clinical utility. Alternate schedules with a more favorable therapeutic index are undergoing clinical testing and should be pursued. The high level of toxicity observed with orally administered low dose 5-FU underscored the potency of eniluracil as a biochemical modulator.","['Meropol, N J', 'Niedzwiecki, D', 'Hollis, D', 'Schilsky, R L', 'Mayer, R J']","['Meropol NJ', 'Niedzwiecki D', 'Hollis D', 'Schilsky RL', 'Mayer RJ']","['Divisions of Medical Science and Population Science, Fox Chase Cancer Center, Philadelphia, Pennslyvania, USA. nj_meropol@fccc.edu']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Clinical Trial, Phase II', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '2E2W0W5XIU (eniluracil)', '56HH86ZVCT (Uracil)', 'EC 1.- (Oxidoreductases)', 'EC 1.3.- (Oxidoreductases Acting on CH-CH Group Donors)', 'EC 1.3.1.1 (Dihydrouracil Dehydrogenase (NAD+))', 'EC 2.1.1.45 (Thymidylate Synthase)', 'Q573I9DVLP (Leucovorin)', 'U3P01618RT (Fluorouracil)']",IM,"['Administration, Oral', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Carcinoma/*drug therapy/mortality/pathology', 'Colorectal Neoplasms/*drug therapy/mortality/pathology', 'Dihydrouracil Dehydrogenase (NAD+)', 'Disease Progression', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Female', 'Fluorouracil/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Humans', 'Leucovorin/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Oxidoreductases/antagonists & inhibitors', '*Oxidoreductases Acting on CH-CH Group Donors', 'Thymidylate Synthase/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Uracil/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology']",,2001/04/03 10:00,2001/05/22 10:01,['2001/04/03 10:00'],"['2001/04/03 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/05/22 10:01 [medline]', '2001/04/03 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer. 2001 Apr 1;91(7):1256-63. doi: 10.1002/1097-0142(20010401)91:7<1256::aid-cncr1126>3.0.co;2-v.,,['Copyright 2001 American Cancer Society.'],"['10.1002/1097-0142(20010401)91:7<1256::AID-CNCR1126>3.0.CO;2-V [pii]', '10.1002/1097-0142(20010401)91:7<1256::aid-cncr1126>3.0.co;2-v [doi]']",,['CA31946-19/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],['Cancer and Leukemia Group B'],,,,,,,,,,,

Conditional expression of C/EBPalpha triggers neutrophilic differentiation, and Cebpa knockout mice exhibit an early block in maturation. Dominant-negative mutations of CEBPA have been found in some patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML), but not in AML with the t(8;21) translocation which gives rise to the fusion gene RUNX1-CBF2T1 (also known as AML1-ETO) encoding the AML1-ETO fusion protein. RUNX1-CBF2T1 positive-AML blasts had eight-fold lower CEBPA RNA levels and undetectable C/EBPalpha protein levels compared with other subgroups of AML patients. Conditional expression of RUNX1-CBF2T1 in U937 cells downregulated CEBPA mRNA, protein and DNA binding activity. AML1-ETO appears to suppress C/EBPalpha expression indirectly by inhibiting positive autoregulation of the CEBPA promoter. Conditional expression of C/EBPalpha in AML1-ETO-positive Kasumi-1 cells results in neutrophilic differentiation. We suggest that restoring C/EBPalpha expression will have therapeutic implications in RUNX1-CBF2T1-positive leukemias.","['Pabst, T', 'Mueller, B U', 'Harakawa, N', 'Schoch, C', 'Haferlach, T', 'Behre, G', 'Hiddemann, W', 'Zhang, D E', 'Tenen, D G']","['Pabst T', 'Mueller BU', 'Harakawa N', 'Schoch C', 'Haferlach T', 'Behre G', 'Hiddemann W', 'Zhang DE', 'Tenen DG']","['Hematology/Oncology Division, Harvard Institutes of Medicine, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Nat Med,Nature medicine,9502015,"['0 (AML1-ETO fusion protein, human)', '0 (CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Protein-alpha)', '0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (RUNX1 Translocation Partner 1 Protein)', '0 (RUNX1 protein, human)', '0 (Runx1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Protein-alpha/*genetics', 'Cell Differentiation/genetics', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 21/genetics', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 8/genetics', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit', 'DNA Primers/genetics', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics', 'Down-Regulation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/pathology', 'Mice', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/genetics/*physiology', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', '*Proto-Oncogene Proteins', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'RNA, Neoplasm/genetics/metabolism', 'RUNX1 Translocation Partner 1 Protein', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/*physiology', 'Translocation, Genetic']",,2001/04/03 10:00,2001/05/01 10:01,['2001/04/03 10:00'],"['2001/04/03 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/05/01 10:01 [medline]', '2001/04/03 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Nat Med. 2001 Apr;7(4):444-51. doi: 10.1038/86515.,,,"['10.1038/86515 [doi]', '86515 [pii]']",,"['CA72009/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL56745/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",,['Nat Med. 2001 Apr;7(4):407-8.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Bone marrow DNA obtained from 26 patients with APL at diagnosis and during follow-up was studied with the methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction (MS-PCR). Serial marrow DNA was studied by MS-PCR for MRD, and disease-free and overall survival were correlated with p15 methylation status at diagnosis. RESULTS: MS-PCR for p16 and p15 gene methylation has a maximum sensitivity of 10(-4) and 10(-5). At diagnosis, 19 patients (73.1%) exhibited p15 methylation, whereas only three patients (11.5%) exhibited p16 methylation, all of whom had concomitant p15 methylation. During follow-up, p16 methylation was acquired in two patients, one during the third hematologic relapse, and the other during transformation into therapy-related myelodysplastic syndrome. Six patients were evaluated serially with MS-PCR for p15 methylation at diagnosis and at follow-up examinations. Persistent p15 methylation preceded subsequent hematologic relapses in two patients, and conversion to negative MS-PCR for p15 methylation correlated with prolonged survival in another four patients. The 5-year disease-free survival of patients with p15 methylation was significantly inferior to that of patients without p15 methylation (15% v 62.5%; P =.02), and this remained significant in multivariate analysis. CONCLUSION: In APL, p15 but not p16 gene methylation is frequent. It is possible that p16 methylation is acquired during clonal evolution. p15 methylation is a potential marker of MRD and might be of prognostic significance.","['Chim, C S', 'Liang, R', 'Tam, C Y', 'Kwong, Y L']","['Chim CS', 'Liang R', 'Tam CY', 'Kwong YL']","['University Department of Medicine, Queen Mary Hospital, University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong. jcschin@hkucc.hku.hk']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (DNA Primers)']",IM,"['Actuarial Analysis', 'Adult', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*genetics', '*DNA Methylation', 'DNA Primers', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', '*Genes, Tumor Suppressor', '*Genes, p16', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*diagnosis/*genetics', 'Logistic Models', 'Male', 'Neoplasm, Residual', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction/methods', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Survival Rate']",,2001/04/03 10:00,2001/05/22 10:01,['2001/04/03 10:00'],"['2001/04/03 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/05/22 10:01 [medline]', '2001/04/03 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2001 Apr 1;19(7):2033-40. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2001.19.7.2033.,,,['10.1200/JCO.2001.19.7.2033 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: After completion of induction-consolidation phase, children with increased-risk (risk factor > 0.8 or T-lineage) ALL or stage III and IV lymphoblastic lymphoma were randomized to receive four courses of HD MTX (5 g/m(2) over 24 hours every 2 weeks) and four intrathecal administrations of MTX (Arm A) or the same treatment schedule with additional HD IV Ara-C (1 g/m(2) in bolus injection 12 and 24 hours after the start of each MTX infusion) (Arm B). RESULTS: Between January 1990 and January 1996, 653 patients with ALL (593 patients) or lymphoblastic lymphoma (60 patients) were randomized: 323 were assigned to Arm A (without Ara-C) and 330 to Arm B (with Ara-C). A total of 190 events (177 relapses and 13 deaths without relapse) were reported, and the median follow up was 6.5 years (range, 2 to 10 years). The incidence rates of CNS relapse were similar in both arms whether isolated (5.6% and 3.3%, respectively) or combined (5.3% and 4.6%, respectively). The estimated 6-year disease-free survival (DFS) rate was similar (log-rank P =.67) in the two treatment groups: 70.4% (SE = 2.6%) in Arm A and 71.0% (SE = 2.5%) in Arm B. The 6-year DFS rate was similar for ALL and LL patients: 70.2% (SE = 1.9%) versus 76.3% (SE = 5.6%). CONCLUSION: Prevention of CNS relapse was satisfactorily achieved with HD IV MTX and intrathecal injections of MTX in children with increased-risk ALL or stage III and IV lymphoblastic lymphoma treated with our BFM-based treatment protocol in which cranial irradiation was omitted. Disappointingly, with the dose schedule used in this protocol, HD Ara-C added to HD MTX, although well tolerated, failed to further decrease the incidence of CNS relapse or to improve the overall DFS.","['Millot, F', 'Suciu, S', 'Philippe, N', 'Benoit, Y', 'Mazingue, F', 'Uyttebroeck, A', 'Lutz, P', 'Mechinaud, F', 'Robert, A', 'Boutard, P', 'Marguerite, G', 'Ferster, A', 'Plouvier, E', 'Rialland, X', 'Behard, C', 'Plantaz, D', 'Dresse, M F', 'Philippet, P', 'Norton, L', 'Thyss, A', 'Dastugue, N', 'Waterkeyn, C', 'Vilmer, E', 'Otten, J']","['Millot F', 'Suciu S', 'Philippe N', 'Benoit Y', 'Mazingue F', 'Uyttebroeck A', 'Lutz P', 'Mechinaud F', 'Robert A', 'Boutard P', 'Marguerite G', 'Ferster A', 'Plouvier E', 'Rialland X', 'Behard C', 'Plantaz D', 'Dresse MF', 'Philippet P', 'Norton L', 'Thyss A', 'Dastugue N', 'Waterkeyn C', 'Vilmer E', 'Otten J']","['Department of Pediatrics, University Hospital of Poitiers, France. f.millot@chu-poitiers.fr']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Clinical Trial, Phase III', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,"['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', 'EC 3.5.1.1 (Asparaginase)', 'VB0R961HZT (Prednisone)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)', 'PVDA protocol']",IM,"['Actuarial Analysis', 'Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*administration & dosage/therapeutic use', 'Asparaginase/administration & dosage', 'Central Nervous System/pathology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cytarabine/*administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Daunorubicin/administration & dosage', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Drug Synergism', 'Europe/epidemiology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Infusions, Intravenous', 'Injections, Spinal', 'Leukemic Infiltration/epidemiology/prevention & control', 'Male', 'Methotrexate/administration & dosage', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/mortality', 'Prednisone/administration & dosage', 'Regression Analysis', 'Risk', 'Vincristine/administration & dosage']",,2001/04/03 10:00,2001/05/05 10:01,['2001/04/03 10:00'],"['2001/04/03 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/05/05 10:01 [medline]', '2001/04/03 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2001 Apr 1;19(7):1935-42. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2001.19.7.1935.,,,['10.1200/JCO.2001.19.7.1935 [doi]'],,"['5U10-CA11488-20/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', '5U10-CA11488-29/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","[""Children's Leukemia Cooperative Group of the European Organiztaion for Research"", 'and Treatment of Cancer']",,,,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: The analyses included 4,986 children (2 to 21 years of age) with newly diagnosed acute lymphoblastic leukemia enrolled onto risk-adjusted protocols between 1988 and 1995. Analyses were based on a model of 100 patients. The marginal cost-effectiveness ratio (hospital days per additional patient surviving event-free) was the difference in total duration of hospitalization divided by the difference in number of event-free survivors at 5 years for two regimens. Relapse-adjusted marginal cost of frontline therapy was the difference in total duration of hospitalization for frontline therapy plus relapse therapy divided by the difference in number of event-free survivors at 5 years on the frontline therapy for two regimens. RESULTS: One or two delayed intensification (DI) phases, augmented therapy, and dexamethasone all improved outcome. Marginal cost-effectiveness of these regimens compared with the control regimens was 133 days per patient for DI, 117 days per patient for double DI, and 41 days per patient for augmented therapy. Dexamethasone resulted in 17 fewer days per patient. Relapse-adjusted marginal costs were 68 days per patient for DI and 52 days for double DI. Augmented therapy and dexamethasone-based therapy resulted in 16 and 82 fewer hospital days, respectively. The estimated cost-effectiveness for treating any first relapse was 250 days per patient.

Flow cytometric analysis showed that the hypodiploid nuclei of HL-60 cells were increased to 40.93% after a 36-h treatment with esculetin (100 microM). Further investigation showed that esculetin induced the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria into cytosol in a time-dependent and concentration-dependent manner. Moreover, esculetin application reduced Bcl-2 protein expression to 58% after 9 h as compared with that time at 0. Cysteine protease 32 kDa proenzyme (CPP32), a caspase 3, was activated and its substrate, poly (adenosine diphosphate-ribose) polymerase, was cleaved after a 24-h treatment of HL-60 cells with esculetin.

In monocytes and monocytic leukemia cells, beta1 integrin-mediated adhesion results in a strong induction of immediate-early genes that are important in inflammation. To investigate the signaling pathways from integrins in monocytic cells, THP-1 cells were stimulated via beta1 integrins by binding to fibronectin and by crosslinking the integrins with specific monoclonal antibodies. The involvement of MAPK and PI 3-K on nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB) activation was then analyzed. We found that integrins activated both NF-kappaB and MAPK in a PI 3-K-dependent manner, as wortmannin and LY294002 blocked these responses. However, the specific MEK inhibitor PD98059 did not prevent integrin-mediated NF-kappaB activation. In contrast, a dominant negative mutant of Rac completely prevented NF-kappaB activation, but it did not affect MAPK activation. These results indicate that integrin signaling to NF-kappaB is not mediated by the MAPK pathway, but rather by the small GTPase Rac. In addition, a dominant negative form of Rho augmented NF-kappaB activation and blocked MAPK activation, implying that these two pathways are in competition with each other. These data suggest that integrins activate different signaling pathways in monocytic cells. One uses PI 3-K and Rac to activate NF-kappaB, while the other uses PI 3-K, MEK, and MAPK to activate other nuclear factors, such as Elk-1.","['Reyes-Reyes, M', 'Mora, N', 'Zentella, A', 'Rosales, C']","['Reyes-Reyes M', 'Mora N', 'Zentella A', 'Rosales C']","['Immunology Department at Instituto de Investigaciones Biomedicas, Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico, Mexico City, Mexico.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,J Cell Sci,Journal of cell science,0052457,"['0 (Integrins)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (GTP Phosphohydrolases)']",IM,"['Cytoskeleton/diagnostic imaging/metabolism', 'GTP Phosphohydrolases/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Integrins/*agonists/metabolism', 'Leukemia/metabolism/pathology', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/*metabolism', 'NF-kappa B/*metabolism', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/*physiology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Ultrasonography']",,2001/04/03 10:00,2001/07/04 10:01,['2001/04/03 10:00'],"['2001/04/03 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/07/04 10:01 [medline]', '2001/04/03 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Cell Sci. 2001 Apr;114(Pt 8):1579-89.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Jaymee's case was widely reported at the time and came to epitomize the dilemmas of rationing in the United Kingdom's National Health Service. In reality, the paediatricians who had cared for Jaymee based their decision on clinical rather than financial considerations, and the media reporting of the case failed to reflect the complexities of the issues involved. The case also demonstrated the difficulties of determining the best interests of children and of obtaining their consent to treatment. There were disagreements between Jaymee's father and the paediatricians who had treated her about how her best interests could be served and this led to a breakdown of trust and the search for further opinions. This highlighted the rise of consumerism in health care and the challenge to doctors and managers to justify their decisions and to give reasons for these decisions. The common theme in Jaymee's story is the need for greater openness in decisions on priority setting and stronger safeguards for patients.","['Ham, Chris']",['Ham C'],"['Health Services Management Centre, University of Birmingham, Birmingham, UK.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Health Expect,Health expectations : an international journal of public participation in health care and health policy,9815926,,,,,2001/04/03 10:00,2001/04/03 10:01,['2001/04/03 10:00'],"['2001/04/03 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/04/03 10:01 [medline]', '2001/04/03 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Health Expect. 1999 Mar;2(1):61-68. doi: 10.1046/j.1369-6513.1999.00036.x.,,,"['hex036 [pii]', '10.1046/j.1369-6513.1999.00036.x [doi]']",PMC5061402,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Resolution of an immediate C5-CO2Me-CBI precursor and its incorporation into both enantiomers of 16 and 17, analogues of the duocarmycins, are also detailed. A study of the solvolysis reactivity and regioselectivity of N-BOC-C5-CO2Me-CBI (12) revealed that the introduction of a C5 methyl ester modestly slowed the rate of solvolysis (1.8x, pH 3) without altering the inherent reaction regioselectivity (>20:1). The comparison of the X-ray structures of the N-CO2Me derivatives of C5-CO2Me-CBI and CBI revealed correlations with the reaction regioselectivity and the relative reactivity of the compounds. The latter correlated well with the less reactive C5-CO2Me-CBI exhibiting a shortened N2-C2a bond length (1.386 vs 1.390 A) and smaller chi1 dihedral angle (8.1 degrees vs 21.2 degrees ) indicative of greater vinylogous amide conjugation and was accompanied by a diminished (cross-conjugated) cyclopropane conjugation (shorter bond lengths). Establishment of the DNA alkyation properties revealed that C5-CO2Me-CBI-based agents retained the identical alkylation selectivity of the natural products. More importantly, the C5 methyl ester was found to decrease the rate (0.77x) of DNA alkylation relative to CBI, consistent with its inherent lower reactivity. These results indicate that the previously observed increase in the rate of DNA alkylation for C7-substituted CBI analogues including CCBI (7-cyano-CBI) is contrary to expectations based on their inherent reactivities. Unlike 17, in which the C5 methyl ester does not bind in the minor groove, the C7 substituent lies in the minor groove extending the rigid length of the agents, further enhancing the DNA binding-induced conformational change responsible for activation toward nucleophilic attack and catalysis of the DNA alkylation reaction.","['Boger, D L', 'Hughes, T V', 'Hedrick, M P']","['Boger DL', 'Hughes TV', 'Hedrick MP']","['Department of Chemistry and The Skaggs Institute for Chemical Biology, The Scripps Research Institute, 10550 North Torrey Pines Road, La Jolla, California 92037, USA. boger@scripps.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Org Chem,The Journal of organic chemistry,2985193R,"['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating)', '0 (Duocarmycins)', '0 (Indoles)', '0 (Leucomycins)', '0 (Pyrroles)', '0 (Pyrrolidinones)', '130288-24-3 (duocarmycin SA)', '69866-21-3 (CC 1065)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'PJV9990868 (duocarmycin A)']",IM,"['Alkylation', 'Animals', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/*chemical synthesis/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating/*chemical synthesis/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Crystallography, X-Ray', 'DNA/drug effects/metabolism', 'Duocarmycins', '*Indoles', 'Inhibitory Concentration 50', 'Kinetics', 'Leucomycins/*chemical synthesis/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia L1210/drug therapy', 'Mice', 'Pyrroles/chemical synthesis/chemistry/pharmacology', 'Pyrrolidinones/*chemical synthesis/chemistry/*pharmacology']",,2001/04/03 10:00,2001/06/15 10:01,['2001/04/03 10:00'],"['2001/04/03 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/06/15 10:01 [medline]', '2001/04/03 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Org Chem. 2001 Apr 6;66(7):2207-16. doi: 10.1021/jo001772g.,,,"['jo001772g [pii]', '10.1021/jo001772g [doi]']",,['CA 41986/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,

However, T cells were less activated after BCT than after BMT, as demonstrated by a lower expression level of CD25 and a lower percentage of HLA-DR+ and CD95+ T cells. Furthermore, CD4+, CD8+ and CD45RA+ post-BCT T cell counts correlated with the number of cells infused with the PBSC graft, while such a correlation was not observed between post-BMT counts and BM graft cell numbers, suggesting that the intensity of post-transplant peripheral lymphoid expansion and/or deletion differed between BCT and BMT. A comparison of the input of T cells expressing different CD45 isoforms with the post-transplant cell recovery further confirmed that, within the CD4+ T cell subset, post-transplant expansions occurred at a higher level after BMT than after BCT, affecting mainly the CD4+ CD45RO+ subset.

Glycoprotein IIb (GPIIb) is the alpha-subunit of the platelet membrane protein GPIIb/IIIa, which functions as a specific receptor for platelet aggregation. Human erythroleukemia (HEL) cells are megakaryocytelike and express the megakaryocyte-specific GPIIb gene. To understand the molecular mechanism of alpha-tocopherol on antiaggregation, we analyzed the effect of physiologically relevant concentrations of alpha-tocopherol on the expression of human GPIIb promoter in HEL cells. The enhancement of tetradecanoylphoerbol-12,13-acetate (TPA)-mediated transient and optimal expression of plasmids was achieved by adding 10(-7)-M TPA in the medium 24 h before lipofection. Transient expression of GPIIb promoter was determined in transfected cells pretreated with various concentrations of alpha-tocopherol. Our data shows that the GPIIb promoter activity was downregulated to 55, 23, 27, 20, and 15% in the presence of 10, 20, 40, 80, and 120 microg/ml of alpha-tocopherol, respectively, as compared with that in the absence of alpha-tocopherol. The downregulation of alpha-tocopherol on the TPA-mediated GPIIb promoter activity may result in a reduction of GPIIb protein expression and thus contribute to antiplatelet aggregation.","['Chang, S J', 'Lin, J S', 'Chen, H H']","['Chang SJ', 'Lin JS', 'Chen HH']","['Department of Biology, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan, ROC. sjchang@mail.ncku.edu.tw']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Free Radic Biol Med,Free radical biology & medicine,8709159,"['0 (Platelet Glycoprotein GPIb-IX Complex)', '0 (Platelet Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (glycoprotein receptor GPIb-IX)', '1406-18-4 (Vitamin E)', 'EC 2.3.1.28 (Chloramphenicol O-Acetyltransferase)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Chloramphenicol O-Acetyltransferase/genetics', 'Down-Regulation/*drug effects', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/*drug effects', 'Genes, Reporter', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute', 'Megakaryocytes/cytology/drug effects/*physiology', 'Platelet Aggregation/drug effects', 'Platelet Glycoprotein GPIb-IX Complex/*genetics', '*Platelet Membrane Glycoproteins', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', '*Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Restriction Mapping', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Vitamin E/*pharmacology']",,2001/04/03 10:00,2001/06/29 10:01,['2001/04/03 10:00'],"['2001/04/03 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/06/29 10:01 [medline]', '2001/04/03 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Free Radic Biol Med. 2000 Jan 15;28(2):202-7. doi: 10.1016/s0891-5849(99)00219-1.,,,"['S0891-5849(99)00219-1 [pii]', '10.1016/s0891-5849(99)00219-1 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We report here that Purpurin-18 (Pu18) in combination with light induces rapid apoptotic cell death in the human leukemia cell line (HL60) at low doses and necrosis at higher concentrations. Cells treated with Pu18 and light under apoptotic conditions exhibited DNA laddering and an increase in both cellular content of subdiploid DNA and externalization of phosphatidylserine (PS), indicating DNA fragmentation and loss of membrane phospholipid asymmetry. In the absence of light activation, Pu18 at nanomolar concentrations had no detectable cytotoxic effect. Caspase-3 activity was increased even after 1 h from treatment with low doses of Pu18 and light. The PS exposure and nuclear features of apoptosis were prevented by treatment of cells before illumination with caspase inhibitors benzyloxycarbonyl-Val-Ala-Asp-fluoromethylketone (Z-VAD-FMK) and benzyloxycarbonyl-Asp-Glu-Val-Asp-fluoromethylketone (Z-DEVD-FMK). Conversely, the caspase-1 inhibitor, acetyl-Tyr-Val-Ala-Asp-aldehyde (Ac-YVAD-CHO) failed to suppress the apoptosis. No protective effect of the three caspase inhibitors was observed when the cells were exposed to necrotic concentrations of Pu18 and light. Our results show that caspase-3, but not caspase-1, is involved in the signaling of apoptotic events in PDT with Pu18-induced apoptosis of HL60 cells. Moreover, both the time course of PS exposure and the effect of caspase inhibitors on it indicate that it is regulated in the same manner as DNA fragmentation.","['Di Stefano, A', 'Ettorre, A', 'Sbrana, S', 'Giovani, C', 'Neri, P']","['Di Stefano A', 'Ettorre A', 'Sbrana S', 'Giovani C', 'Neri P']","['Department of Molecular Biology, University of Siena, Via Fiorentina 1, 53100 Siena, Italy. distefano@unisi.it']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Photochem Photobiol,Photochemistry and photobiology,0376425,"['0 (Porphyrins)', '25465-77-4 (purpurin 18)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Necrosis', '*Photochemotherapy', 'Porphyrins/*pharmacology']",,2001/04/03 10:00,2001/05/05 10:01,['2001/04/03 10:00'],"['2001/04/03 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/05/05 10:01 [medline]', '2001/04/03 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Photochem Photobiol. 2001 Mar;73(3):290-6. doi: 10.1562/0031-8655(2001)073<0290:picwll>2.0.co;2.,,,['10.1562/0031-8655(2001)073<0290:picwll>2.0.co;2 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Mean survival age of experimental AKR/J mice treated with the E. purpurea preparation was significantly prolonged and enlargement of thymic lymphoma in experimental mice was significantly suppressed compared with controls. In normal 3-week-old female AKR/J mice, mortality from thymic lymphoma was delayed markedly after injection into the thymus of cell-free extract of thymus from the experimental 28-week-old female AKR/J mice that received the oral E. purpurea preparation was injected directly into the thymus. Proliferation of endogenous recombinant murine leukemia viruses (MuLV) in the thymus was markedly inhibited after the first oral administration of the E. purpurea preparation as compared with untreated controls (final age, 28 weeks). Production of endogenous interferon (IFN)-gamma in AKR/J mice was also effectively augmented by the oral treatment with the E. purpurea preparation, however, the production of other cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha and interleukin (IL)-12 was minimal. These results suggest that this suppressive effects on spontaneously occurring leukemia caused by endogenous recombinant MuLV in female AKR/J mice may depend on enhancement of nonspecific immune or cellular immune systems (or of both) by the E. purpurea preparation.","['Hayashi, I', 'Ohotsuki, M', 'Suzuki, I', 'Watanabe, T']","['Hayashi I', 'Ohotsuki M', 'Suzuki I', 'Watanabe T']","['Department of Clinical Nutrition, Suzuka University of Medical Science.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Japan,Nihon Rinsho Meneki Gakkai Kaishi,Nihon Rinsho Men'eki Gakkai kaishi = Japanese journal of clinical immunology,9505992,['0 (Plant Extracts)'],IM,"['Animals', '*Echinacea', 'Female', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*drug therapy', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred AKR', 'Plant Extracts/administration & dosage/pharmacology', '*Plants, Medicinal']",,2001/04/03 10:00,2001/06/08 10:01,['2001/04/03 10:00'],"['2001/04/03 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/06/08 10:01 [medline]', '2001/04/03 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Nihon Rinsho Meneki Gakkai Kaishi. 2001 Feb;24(1):10-20. doi: 10.2177/jsci.24.10.,,,['10.2177/jsci.24.10 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this work, a prostate carcinoma spheroid model was used to evaluate the feasibility of targeting micrometastatic clusters of tumor cells using 213Bi-labeled anti-prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) antibody, J591. In prostate cancer, vascular dissemination of tumor cells or tumor cell clusters to the marrow constitutes an important step in the progression of this disease to widespread skeletal involvement, an incurable state. Such prevascularized clusters are ideal targets for radiolabeled antibodies because the barriers to antibody penetration that are associated with the capillary basal lamina have not yet formed. Beta- and gamma-emitting radionuclides such as 131I, which are widely used in radioimmunotherapy, are not expected to be effective when targeting single cells or small cell clusters. This is because the range of the emissions is one to two orders of magnitude greater than the target size, and the energy deposited per traversal is insufficient to produce any significant radiobiological effect. Spheroids of the prostate cancer cell line, LNCaP-LN3, were used as a model of prevascularized micrometastases; their response to an anti-PSMA antibody, J591, radiolabeled with the alpha-particle emitter 213Bi (T(1/2), 45.6 min.) has been measured. The time course of spheroid volume reductions was found to be sensitive to the initial spheroid volume. J591 labeled with 0.9 MBq/ml 213Bi resulted in a 3-log reduction in spheroid volume on day 33, relative to control, for spheroids with an initial diameter of 130 microm; 1.8 MBq/ml were required to achieve a similar response for spheroids with an initial diameter of 180 microm. Equivalent spheroid responses were observed after 12 Gy of acute external beam photon irradiation. Monte Carlo-based microdosimetric analyses of the 213Bi decay distribution in individual spheroids of 130-microm diameter yielded an average alpha-particle dose of 3.7 Gy to the spheroids, resulting in a relative biological effectiveness factor of 3.2 over photon irradiation. The activity concentrations used in the experiments were clinically relevant, and this work supports the possibility of using 213Bi-labeled antibodies not only for disseminated single tumor cells, as found in patients with leukemia, but also for micrometastatic tumor deposits up to 180 microm in diameter (1200 cells).","['Ballangrud, A M', 'Yang, W H', 'Charlton, D E', 'McDevitt, M R', 'Hamacher, K A', 'Panageas, K S', 'Ma, D', 'Bander, N H', 'Scheinberg, D A', 'Sgouros, G']","['Ballangrud AM', 'Yang WH', 'Charlton DE', 'McDevitt MR', 'Hamacher KA', 'Panageas KS', 'Ma D', 'Bander NH', 'Scheinberg DA', 'Sgouros G']","['Department of Medical Physics, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York 10021, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, Surface)', '0 (Immunotoxins)', '0 (Radioisotopes)', 'EC 3.4.- (Carboxypeptidases)', 'EC 3.4.17.21 (FOLH1 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.17.21 (Glutamate Carboxypeptidase II)', 'U015TT5I8H (Bismuth)']",IM,"['Alpha Particles/therapeutic use', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/immunology/metabolism/pharmacology', '*Antigens, Surface', 'Bismuth/*pharmacology', 'Carboxypeptidases/*immunology', 'Cell Division/radiation effects', 'Glutamate Carboxypeptidase II', 'Humans', 'Immunotoxins/immunology/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Male', 'Microscopy, Confocal', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Prostatic Neoplasms/immunology/*radiotherapy', 'Radioimmunotherapy', 'Radioisotopes/*pharmacology', 'Spheroids, Cellular/immunology/radiation effects', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,2001/03/31 10:00,2001/04/21 10:01,['2001/03/31 10:00'],"['2001/03/31 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/04/21 10:01 [medline]', '2001/03/31 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 2001 Mar 1;61(5):2008-14.,,,,,"['P01 CA-33049/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA-55349/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA-72683/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Both in vitro and in vivo, PNU-159548 did retain its activity in cells expressing the multidrug resistance (MDR) phenotype, associated to MIDR-1 gene overexpression or with an alteration in the topoisomerase II gene (altered MDR), independently on the drug used for the selection of the resistant cell line. According to these data, the intracellular uptake of PNU-159548 is not influenced by the presence of MDR-1. PNU-159548 was also active, both in vitro and in vivo, against cells showing resistance to various alkylating agents iincluding cisplatin, cyclophosphamide, and melphalan) and topoisomerase I-inhibitors. Cells defective in nucleotide excision repair, which did show hypersensitivity to treatment with UV irradiation and alkylating agents, showed only a marginally increased sensitivity to PNU-159548. Similarly, the activity of the drug was not influenced by the mismatch repair system, as assessed in two different cellular systems deficient in hMLH1 expression and in which hMLH1 activity was restored by chromosome 3 transfer. The results obtained clearly indicate that the new anticancer agent PNU-159548 is able to overcome the classical mechanisms of resistance emerging after treatment with the most clinically used anticancer agents, and it could represent an alternate choice in the treatment of those tumors refractory to conventional therapy.","['Marchini, S', 'Damia, G', 'Broggini, M', 'Pennella, G', 'Ripamonti, M', 'Marsiglio, A', 'Geroni, C']","['Marchini S', 'Damia G', 'Broggini M', 'Pennella G', 'Ripamonti M', 'Marsiglio A', 'Geroni C']","['Laboratory of Molecular Pharmacology, Istituto di Ricerche Farmacologiche Mario Negri, Milan, Italy. marchini@marionegri.it']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"[""0 (4-demethoxy-3'-deamino-3'-aziridinyl-4'-methylsulfonyldaunorubicin)"", '0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/*pharmacology', 'CHO Cells', 'Cricetinae', 'Daunorubicin/analogs & derivatives/*pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Inhibitory Concentration 50', 'Leukemia L1210/drug therapy', 'Leukemia P388/drug therapy', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Inbred DBA', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/*drug effects']",,2001/03/31 10:00,2001/04/21 10:01,['2001/03/31 10:00'],"['2001/03/31 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/04/21 10:01 [medline]', '2001/03/31 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 2001 Mar 1;61(5):1991-5.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Using Western immunoblotting to examine the cytosolic and membrane fractions of the human CCRF-CEM T-cell lymphoblastic leukemia cell line, polyclonal antihuman RFC antiserum recognized two bands in the cytosolic fraction (approximately 60 kDa and approximately 70 kDa) on 10% polyacrylamide gels. In the membrane fraction, an approximately 60-kDa protein was identified. Comparative studies of a panel of human tumor cell lines including the HT1080 fibrosarcoma, 8805 malignant fibrous histiocytoma, and the MCF breast cancer cell lines revealed similar findings. Likewise, a recombinant approximately 60-kDa membrane protein was identified after expression of baculovirus-infected Sf9 insect cells containing cDNA of the human RFC. In the CEM-7A cell line, a variant of the CCRF-CEM cell line that overexpresses the RFC, 21-fold overexpression of the approximately 60-kDa membrane protein (RFC) was shown by Western analysis. To characterize further the cellular distribution of the human RFC, immunohistochemical analyses were performed in CCRF-CEM T-cell lymphoblastic leukemia cells. Predominantly membrane localization of the antibody reacting sites was detected; however, a cytoplasmic component was noted as well. By confocal microscopy and by immunogold electron microscopy, the cytoplasmic expression was found to be largely of mitochondrial origin. These findings were corroborated by Western immunoblotting of mitochondrial membrane isolates from the CCRF-CEM cell line, which demonstrate an approximately 60-kDa protein. The localization of the human RFC to the mitochondrial membrane is a novel finding, and it suggests a role for the mitochondrial membrane in the transport of folates.","['Trippett, T M', 'Garcia, S', 'Manova, K', 'Mody, R', 'Cohen-Gould, L', 'Flintoff, W', 'Bertino, J R']","['Trippett TM', 'Garcia S', 'Manova K', 'Mody R', 'Cohen-Gould L', 'Flintoff W', 'Bertino JR']","['Department of Pediatrics, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York 10021, USA.

Hepatic dysfunction is often present but the nature of the hepatic lesions and related manifestations have not been fully characterized. The aim of this study was to ascertain the features of hepatic involvement in hemophagocytic syndrome. METHODS: Thirty patients with hemophagocytic syndrome were retrospectively studied. Inclusion criteria included: 1) bone marrow with hemophagocytic histiocytosis, 2) clinical or biological signs of hepatic involvement, and 3) available liver specimen. RESULTS: The association of fever, jaundice, and hepatomegaly or splenomegaly was present in 50% of the patients. Median value for serum alanine transaminase activity was five times the upper limit of normal values (range, 0.3-125), for serum alkaline phosphatase activity 2.7 upper limit of normal values (range, 0.2-47.7), for total bilirubin 136 micromol/L (range, 4-681 micromol/L), and for factor V 70% (range, 19-145%). Sinusoidal dilatation with hemophagocytic histiocytosis were found in the biopsy specimen in all patients. An underlying condition potentially responsible for altered immune function (lymphoma, leukemia, liver transplantation) was identified in 29 patients. Liver biopsy was diagnostic for the underlying condition in 15 patients (including eight cases with nonspecific bone marrow biopsy findings). High serum bilirubin, elevated serum alkaline phosphatase activity, low factor V level, and lack of treatment for the underlying disease were associated with a poor prognosis. CONCLUSIONS: Hemophagocytic syndrome should be suspected in immunodeficient patients with fever, jaundice, and hepatosplenomegaly. Hepatic lesions are characterized by nonspecific sinusoidal dilatation with hemophagocytic histiocytosis and in 50% of the patients by alterations specific to the underlying condition. Liver biopsy is a useful diagnostic procedure in patients with this clinical presentation.","['de Kerguenec, C', 'Hillaire, S', 'Molinie, V', 'Gardin, C', 'Degott, C', 'Erlinger, S', 'Valla, D']","['de Kerguenec C', 'Hillaire S', 'Molinie V', 'Gardin C', 'Degott C', 'Erlinger S', 'Valla D']","[""Service d'Hepatologie, H pital Beaujon, Clichy, France.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Am J Gastroenterol,The American journal of gastroenterology,0421030,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Female', 'Histiocytosis, Non-Langerhans-Cell/*complications', 'Humans', 'Liver/pathology/physiopathology', 'Liver Diseases/*etiology/pathology/physiopathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Analysis']",,2001/03/31 10:00,2001/05/01 10:01,['2001/03/31 10:00'],"['2001/03/31 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/05/01 10:01 [medline]', '2001/03/31 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Am J Gastroenterol. 2001 Mar;96(3):852-7. doi: 10.1111/j.1572-0241.2001.03632.x.,,,"['S0002-9270(00)02425-4 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1572-0241.2001.03632.x [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The therapeutic effects were nearly equal for liposomal and free bleomycin in the B16 melanoma. The partial replacement of phosphatidylcholine by alkylphospholipids and the inclusion of polyethylene glycol modified lipids for sterical stabilization did not further improve the therapeutic efficacy but increased, in some cases, the toxicity of liposomes. Bleomycin-induced lung injury was not observed if liposomal bleomycin was administered.","['Arndt, D', 'Zeisig, R', 'Bechtel, D', 'Fichtner, I']","['Arndt D', 'Zeisig R', 'Bechtel D', 'Fichtner I']","['Max Delbruck Center for Medicine for Molecular Medicine, Berlin, Germany. arndt@mdc-berlin.de']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",England,Drug Deliv,Drug delivery,9417471,"['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Liposomes)', '11056-06-7 (Bleomycin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/*administration & dosage/toxicity', 'Bleomycin/*administration & dosage/toxicity', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', '*Drug Delivery Systems', 'Female', 'Liposomes', 'Lung/*drug effects', 'Lung Diseases/*prevention & control', 'Mice', 'Neoplasms, Experimental/*drug therapy']",,2001/03/31 10:00,2001/06/08 10:01,['2001/03/31 10:00'],"['2001/03/31 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/06/08 10:01 [medline]', '2001/03/31 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Drug Deliv. 2001 Jan-Mar;8(1):1-7. doi: 10.1080/107175401300002685.,,,['10.1080/107175401300002685 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: The accumulation and washout of 99mTc-TF were observed in both cell lines at 37 degrees C. The effect of verapamil on the kinetics was also assessed. RESULTS: 99mTc-TF net accumulation was significantly lower in HL60/DOX (1.35 +/- 0.23%) than in HL60/WT (12.79 +/- 0.47%) at 60 min (P < 0.001). Three minutes after exchanging the incubation solution to the tracer-free medium, only 18.20 +/- 0.34% of 99mTc-TF remained in HL60/DOX, whereas 84.74 +/- 0.65% did in HL60/WT (P < 0.001). In the presence of 10 microM verapamil, 99mTc-TF net accumulation in HL60/DOX was 302% of the control and the washout was significantly delayed. CONCLUSION: 99mTc-TF would be a substrate for MRP and 99mTc-TF may be used as a functional imaging agent of MRP in vivo.","['Li, X F', 'Kinuya, S', 'Yokoyama, K', 'Konishi, S', 'Ma, Y Y', 'Watanabe, N', 'Shuke, N', 'Bunko, H', 'Michigishi, T', 'Tonami, N']","['Li XF', 'Kinuya S', 'Yokoyama K', 'Konishi S', 'Ma YY', 'Watanabe N', 'Shuke N', 'Bunko H', 'Michigishi T', 'Tonami N']","['Department of Nuclear Medicine, Kanazawa University School of Medicine, Kanazawa, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,Cancer Biother Radiopharm,Cancer biotherapy & radiopharmaceuticals,9605408,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Calcium Channel Blockers)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Organophosphorus Compounds)', '0 (Organotechnetium Compounds)', '0 (Radiopharmaceuticals)', '42FOP1YX93 (technetium tc-99m tetrofosmin)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', '971Z4W1S09 (Technetium Tc 99m Sestamibi)', 'CJ0O37KU29 (Verapamil)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/genetics/*metabolism', 'Biological Transport/drug effects', 'Calcium Channel Blockers/pharmacology', 'Doxorubicin/pharmacology', '*Drug Resistance, Multiple', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'HL-60 Cells/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Organophosphorus Compounds/*metabolism', 'Organotechnetium Compounds/*metabolism', 'Radiopharmaceuticals/*metabolism', 'Substrate Specificity', 'Technetium Tc 99m Sestamibi/metabolism', 'Tomography, Emission-Computed', 'Verapamil/pharmacology']",,2001/03/31 10:00,2001/09/14 10:01,['2001/03/31 10:00'],"['2001/03/31 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/09/14 10:01 [medline]', '2001/03/31 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Biother Radiopharm. 2001 Feb;16(1):17-23. doi: 10.1089/108497801750095961.,,,['10.1089/108497801750095961 [doi]'],,,,['Cancer Biother Radiopharm. 2001 Feb;16(1):1-7.

Current therapy includes chemotherapy used in combination with all-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA). Although the differentiating effects of ATRA on promyelocytes have been well established, in vitro studies have shown that less-differentiated APL blasts (CD34(+)) demonstrate a variable responsiveness to ATRA. To assess the clinical relevance of this finding, we analyzed a cohort of 38 patients with t(15;17) and/or PML-RARalpha APL to determine the incidence and laboratory features of CD34(+) APL. Thirty-two percent (12/38) of cases were CD34(+). There was a difference in WBC at presentation between CD34(+) and CD34(-) cases (34.6 +/- 9.2, mean +/- standard error vs. 5.4 +/- 2.0, P = 0.009). Patients with CD34(+) APL demonstrated a micro/hypogranular phenotype (75%) (P = 0.001), co-expression of CD2(+) (83%) (P = 0.001), and the bcr3 isoform (100%) (P = 0.017). In contrast, CD34(-) cases demonstrated hypergranular morphology (65%), CD2(+) (15%), and the bcr1 isoform (50%). A high presenting WBC count (\G10 x 10(9)/L) was associated with an inferior overall survival (Log rank = 0.0047). Patients with CD34(+) APL demonstrated an incidence of early mortality of 50%. Despite a marked correlation between CD34 positivity and increased WBC count, overall survival of CD34(+) and CD34(-) cases did not differ significantly in our small cohort. Immunophenotypic analysis for CD34 expression should be included in future large APL trials to determine if detection of CD34(+) blasts represents an independent adverse prognostic factor.","['Foley, R', 'Soamboonsrup, P', 'Carter, R F', 'Benger, A', 'Meyer, R', 'Walker, I', 'Wan, Y', 'Patterson, W', 'Orzel, A', 'Sunisloe, L', 'Leber, B', 'Neame, P B']","['Foley R', 'Soamboonsrup P', 'Carter RF', 'Benger A', 'Meyer R', 'Walker I', 'Wan Y', 'Patterson W', 'Orzel A', 'Sunisloe L', 'Leber B', 'Neame PB']","['Department of Laboratory Medicine, Hamilton Health Sciences Corporation, Hamilton, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Am J Hematol,American journal of hematology,7610369,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (CD2 Antigens)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Protein Isoforms)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (promyelocytic leukemia-retinoic acid receptor alpha fusion oncoprotein)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (BCR protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcr)']",IM,"['Actuarial Analysis', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antigens, CD34/*analysis', 'CD2 Antigens/biosynthesis', 'Cohort Studies', 'Female', 'Granulocytes/pathology', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/diagnosis/*immunology/*pathology', 'Leukocytosis/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Proteins', 'Oncogene Proteins/biosynthesis', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion', 'Prognosis', 'Protein Isoforms/biosynthesis', '*Protein-Tyrosine Kinases', '*Proto-Oncogene Proteins', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcr', 'Survival Rate', 'Translocation, Genetic']",,2001/04/03 10:00,2001/05/01 10:01,['2001/04/03 10:00'],"['2001/04/03 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/05/01 10:01 [medline]', '2001/04/03 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Am J Hematol. 2001 May;67(1):34-41. doi: 10.1002/ajh.1073.,,"['Copyright 2001 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",['10.1002/ajh.1073 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This promptly resolved upon cessation of thalidomide alone. Thalidomide has recently enjoyed renewed interest as a treatment in many disorders, including plasma cell leukemia. To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of thalidomide-associated hepatotoxicity. Although the mechanism of its actions on the liver are uncertain, it is possible that thalidomide acts as a direct hepatotoxin or as an immuno-modulator, altering the activity of chronic viral hepatitis.

The anthracycline idarubicin is highly active alone or in combination chemotherapy for the treatment of APL. To minimize arsenic exposure and based on the high sensitivity of APL cells to anthracyclines, we conducted a prospective study to evaluate induction with As2O3 followed by consolidation with idarubicin in the treatment of APL in relapse. Eight patients were treated with As2O3 at a daily dose of 10 mg until remission, followed by three monthly courses of idarubicin, at 6 mg/m(2)/day for 5 days in the first course and 6 mg/m(2)/day for 2 days in the subsequent two courses. All patients achieved morphological but not molecular remission after As2O3 treatment. During As2O3 therapy, an increase in white cell count peaking at a median of 17 days occurred in all the cases. Serial flow cytometric analysis of apoptosis, with mitochondrial APO2.7 antigen expression and the sub-G1 cell fraction on DNA histogram as markers, showed induction of apoptosis of APL cells in vivo. With both qualitative and real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction, all patients were shown to attain molecular remission after subsequent idarubicin treatment. With a median follow up of 13 months, seven of eight patients have remained in complete clinical remission, with six patients in molecular remission as well. One patient who was in third remission became PCR-positive after being transiently negative. One patient died from an intracranial extramedullary relapse after achieving marrow molecular remission. We conclude that As2O3 induction followed by idarubicin consolidation is an effective therapy for APL in relapse. This regimen avoids the possible long-term toxicities of As2O3 and mutagenicity of combination chemotherapy, a strategy that might be suitable for this potentially curable leukaemia.","['Kwong, Y L', 'Au, W Y', 'Chim, C S', 'Pang, A', 'Suen, C', 'Liang, R']","['Kwong YL', 'Au WY', 'Chim CS', 'Pang A', 'Suen C', 'Liang R']","['University Department of Medicine, Queen Mary Hospital, Hong Kong. ylkwong@hkucc.hku.hk']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Am J Hematol,American journal of hematology,7610369,"['0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Oxides)', '0 (promyelocytic leukemia-retinoic acid receptor alpha fusion oncoprotein)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)', 'ZRP63D75JW (Idarubicin)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals/administration & dosage/pharmacology', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/blood', 'Drug Evaluation', 'Drug Synergism', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Idarubicin/administration & dosage/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/blood/*drug therapy/genetics/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Proteins/blood', 'Neoplasm, Residual', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/blood', 'Oxides/administration & dosage/pharmacology', 'Pilot Projects', 'Prospective Studies', 'Recurrence', 'Remission Induction', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Salvage Therapy', 'Treatment Outcome']",,2001/04/03 10:00,2001/04/21 10:01,['2001/04/03 10:00'],"['2001/04/03 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/04/21 10:01 [medline]', '2001/04/03 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Am J Hematol. 2001 Apr;66(4):274-9. doi: 10.1002/ajh.1057.,,"['Copyright 2001 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",['10.1002/ajh.1057 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The observed infection rate was 50%. Chemoprophylaxis with intravenous continuous low-dose amphotericin B was then instituted as a preventive measure. During the next 18 months invasive pulmonary aspergillosis developed in 43% of acute leukemia patients. After that period a new hematology ward was opened with an air filtration system through high-efficiency particulate air filtration (HEPA) filters, and a bone marrow transplantation program was started on the hematology service. During the following three years, none of the acute leukemia or bone marrow transplantation patients who were hospitalized exclusively in the hematology ward developed invasive pulmonary aspergillosis, although 29% of acute leukemia patients who were housed in a regular ward, because of shortage of space in the new facility, still contracted invasive pulmonary aspergillosis. Overall, 31 patients were diagnosed with invasive pulmonary aspergillosis during almost five years: 74% of patients recovered from invasive pulmonary aspergillosis, and 42% are long-term survivors; 26% of patients died of resistant leukemia with aspergillosis, but no one died of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis alone. In conclusion, during an on-going construction period, an extremely high incidence rate of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis in acute leukemia patients undergoing intensive chemotherapy was observed. Institution of low-dose intravenous amphotericin B prophylaxis marginally reduced the incidence rate of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis.

Conditioning consisted of FLU/busulphan/cyclophosphamide/cyclosporin-A (CyA)/methotrexate, or FLU/melphalan/CyA/methotrexate. The median granulocyte recovery time to 0.5 x 10(9)/l was 11 days, whereas the median platelet recovery time to 20 x 10(9)/l was 12 days. Twelve patients did not need red blood cell transfusions, and 8 did not need platelet transfusions. In 21 individuals (81%), the procedure could be completed fully on an outpatient basis. Follow-up times range between 30 and 600 days: one patient failed to engraft and recovered endogenous hemopoiesis; six out of 26 patients developed acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) whereas 7/22 developed chronic GVHD. Twelve patients (46%) have died, nine of them with a relapsing disease and three with GVHD; median post-transplant survival (SV) was 300 days, whereas the 12-month SV was 42%. The 100-day mortality was 3.8% and the transplant-related mortality was 11.5%. This procedure is substantially less costly than its counterpart, using in-hospital myeloablative conditioning regimens, and it may represent another approach in the management of patients requiring an allogeneic stem cell transplant.","['Ruiz-Arguelles, G J', 'Gomez-Almaguer, D', 'Ruiz-Arguelles, A', 'Gonzalez-Llano, O', 'Cantu, O G', 'Jaime-Perez, J C']","['Ruiz-Arguelles GJ', 'Gomez-Almaguer D', 'Ruiz-Arguelles A', 'Gonzalez-Llano O', 'Cantu OG', 'Jaime-Perez JC']","['Centro de Hematologia y Medicina Interna de Puebla, Puebla, Mexico. gruiz1@prodigy.net.mx']",['eng'],"['Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,Am J Hematol,American journal of hematology,7610369,"['0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '83HN0GTJ6D (Cyclosporine)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'G1LN9045DK (Busulfan)', 'P2K93U8740 (fludarabine)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Ambulatory Care/economics/*statistics & numerical data', 'Busulfan/therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Cyclophosphamide/therapeutic use', 'Cyclosporine/therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Graft Survival', 'Graft vs Host Disease/epidemiology/etiology/prevention & control', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/administration & dosage', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Mobilization/methods', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/economics/methods/*statistics & numerical data', 'Humans', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Leukemia/mortality/therapy', 'Male', 'Methotrexate/therapeutic use', 'Middle Aged', 'Neural Tube Defects/therapy', 'Program Evaluation', 'Recurrence', 'Survival Analysis', 'Thalassemia/therapy', 'Transplantation Conditioning/adverse effects/economics/*methods', 'Transplantation, Homologous/economics/methods/mortality/*statistics & numerical data', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Vidarabine/*analogs & derivatives/*therapeutic use']",,2001/04/03 10:00,2001/04/21 10:01,['2001/04/03 10:00'],"['2001/04/03 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/04/21 10:01 [medline]', '2001/04/03 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Am J Hematol. 2001 Apr;66(4):241-4. doi: 10.1002/ajh.1051.,,"['Copyright 2001 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",['10.1002/ajh.1051 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The Swedish Family-Cancer Database was used to systematically estimate the effects of parental and sibling cancers on the cancer risks in the individuals born after 1934 (offspring). The study population included 5,520,756 offspring and their parents from 2,112,616 nuclear families. Standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) were calculated to analyze the risks for cancers in offspring by parental cancers (offspring risk) and by sibling cancers (sibling risk). For 20 concordant sites, all offspring and sibling risks were significantly increased except for sibling risks for squamous cell carcinoma of the skin and myeloma. Apart from breast cancer, the SIRs were more than 10 when offspring had both an affected parent and an affected sib at the concordant site. The ratio for the sibling to offspring risk was around 2.0 or more for gastric, renal, non-thyroid endocrine, urinary bladder, colon, testicular and prostate cancers and leukemia. For discordant sites, many reported across-site associations were confirmed and several consistent novel associations (rectum-skin, breast-endocrine and lung-endocrine) were found only among sibs. Our findings suggested that low-penetrance polygenic dominant effects or dominant genes of high penetrance but low mutant allele frequency in the population may be involved in the observed familial cancers at many sites. Recessive or X-linked effects may contribute particularly to gastric, renal, non-thyroid endocrine, bladder, colon, testicular and prostate cancers and leukemia. The search for pleiotropic recessive/X-linked susceptibility genes should be well motivated based on our results.","['Dong, C', 'Hemminki, K']","['Dong C', 'Hemminki K']","['Department of Biosciences at Novum, Karolinska Institute, Huddinge, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Breast Neoplasms/genetics', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Colonic Neoplasms/genetics', 'Databases as Topic', 'Female', '*Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/genetics', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Kidney Neoplasms/genetics', 'Lung Neoplasms/genetics', 'Male', 'Melanoma/genetics', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms/*genetics', 'Nervous System Neoplasms/genetics', '*Nuclear Family', '*Parents', 'Prostatic Neoplasms/genetics', 'Rectal Neoplasms/genetics', 'Risk Factors', 'Skin Neoplasms/genetics', 'Stomach Neoplasms/genetics', 'Testicular Neoplasms/genetics', 'Thyroid Neoplasms/genetics', 'Urinary Bladder Neoplasms/genetics', 'Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/genetics']",,2001/04/03 10:00,2001/04/17 10:01,['2001/04/03 10:00'],"['2001/04/03 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/04/17 10:01 [medline]', '2001/04/03 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Int J Cancer. 2001 Apr 1;92(1):144-50.,,"['Copyright 2001 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",['10.1002/1097-0215(20010401)92:1<144::AID-IJC1147>3.0.CO;2-S [pii]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here we present data supporting the notion that granzyme B-mediated cell death is largely dependent on a pathway that is inhibitable by Bcl-2 or its viral analog BHRF1. We used a panel of stably transfected FDC-P1 mouse myeloid cell lines to show that overexpression of functional, wild-type Bcl-2 or BHRF1 rescued cells from granzyme B-mediated apoptosis, whereas mutated (Gly145-->Glu) Bcl-2, or wild-type Bcl-2 directed to the plasma membrane conferred no protection. Overexpression of Bcl-2 resulted in inhibition of multiple parameters of apoptosis in response to purified perforin and granzyme B, including DNA fragmentation, changes in light scatter profile indicating cell shrinkage and increased refractivity, loss of mitochondrial membrane potential and inhibited colony formation in clonogenic assays. Nevertheless, when exposed to cytotoxic lymphocytes, FDC-P1 and YAC-1 cells overexpressing Bcl-2 remained susceptible to death imparted by cytolytic granules, irrespective of whether the granules contained granzyme B. Thus, alternative granzyme B-independent pathways can be activated by intact lymphocytes to overcome Bcl-2-like inhibitors of apoptosis, enabling CTLs to overcome potential viral blocks to granzyme B-mediated cell death.","['Davis, J E', 'Sutton, V R', 'Smyth, M J', 'Trapani, J A']","['Davis JE', 'Sutton VR', 'Smyth MJ', 'Trapani JA']","['John Connell Laboratory, The Austin Research Institute, Studley Road, Heidelberg, 3084, Australia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Cell Death Differ,Cell death and differentiation,9437445,"['0 (BHRF1 protein, Human herpesvirus 4)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Viral Proteins)', 'EC 3.4.21.- (GZMB protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.21.- (Granzymes)', 'EC 3.4.21.- (Gzmb protein, mouse)', 'EC 3.4.21.- (Serine Endopeptidases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/*immunology', 'Gene Expression/physiology', 'Granzymes', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Leukemia, Myeloid', 'Lymphoma', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mitochondria/enzymology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/genetics/*metabolism', 'Serine Endopeptidases/*metabolism', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/*cytology/metabolism', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Viral Proteins/*metabolism']",,2001/03/30 10:00,2001/05/26 10:01,['2001/03/30 10:00'],"['2001/03/30 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/05/26 10:01 [medline]', '2001/03/30 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cell Death Differ. 2000 Oct;7(10):973-83. doi: 10.1038/sj.cdd.4400725.,,,['10.1038/sj.cdd.4400725 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Differentiated HL-60 cells become resistant to some apoptotic stimuli including anticancer drugs or irradiation though undifferentiated cells significantly respond to these stimuli. TRAIL (TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand) which is also known as Apo2 ligand (Apo2L), a new member of TNF family, can induce apoptosis in some tumor cells but not in many normal cells. We show here that apoptosis is well induced in HL-60 cells by TRAIL, but susceptibility to TRAIL is reduced during granulocytic differentiation by DMSO. We also suggest some possible mechanisms by which granulocytic differentiated cells become resistant to TRAIL-induced apoptosis. First, in granulocytic differentiated cells, expression of antagonistic decoy receptors for TRAIL (TRAIL-R3/TRID/DcR1/LIT and TRAIL-R4/TRUNDD/DcR2) were enhanced. In addition, expression of Toso, a cell surface apoptosis regulator, seemed to block activation of caspase-8 by TRAIL via enhanced expression of FLIPL in granulocytic differentiated cells. These findings suggest that differentiated cells are resistant using plural mechanisms against various apoptosis-inducing stimuli rather than undifferentiated cells.","['Shiiki, K', 'Yoshikawa, H', 'Kinoshita, H', 'Takeda, M', 'Ueno, A', 'Nakajima, Y', 'Tasaka, K']","['Shiiki K', 'Yoshikawa H', 'Kinoshita H', 'Takeda M', 'Ueno A', 'Nakajima Y', 'Tasaka K']","['Department of Urology, Yamanashi Medical University, 1110 Shimokato, Tamaho-cho, Yamanashi 409-3898, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Cell Death Differ,Cell death and differentiation,9437445,"['0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (CASP8 and FADD-Like Apoptosis Regulating Protein)', '0 (CFLAR protein, human)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (FCMR protein, human)', '0 (GPI-Linked Proteins)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor)', '0 (Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor, Member 10c)', '0 (TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand)', '0 (TNFRSF10C protein, human)', '0 (TNFSF10 protein, human)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor Decoy Receptors)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP8 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP9 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 8)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 9)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*immunology', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins', 'CASP8 and FADD-Like Apoptosis Regulating Protein', 'Carrier Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Caspase 3', 'Caspase 8', 'Caspase 9', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation/immunology', 'GPI-Linked Proteins', 'Gene Expression/physiology', 'Granulocytes/*cytology/enzymology', 'HL-60 Cells/*cytology/enzymology', 'Humans', '*Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Membrane Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor/genetics/metabolism', 'Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor, Member 10c', 'TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor Decoy Receptors', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/genetics/*metabolism']",,2001/03/30 10:00,2001/05/26 10:01,['2001/03/30 10:00'],"['2001/03/30 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/05/26 10:01 [medline]', '2001/03/30 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cell Death Differ. 2000 Oct;7(10):939-46. doi: 10.1038/sj.cdd.4400727.,,,['10.1038/sj.cdd.4400727 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Between March 1983 and August 1999, 20 of 788 (2.5%) patients receiving allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (BMT) were treated with an additional boost dose of donor cells. The reasons for the use of the boost treatment were primary graft failure (early rejection; n = 7), secondary graft failure including late rejection (n = 10), refractory pure red cell aplasia caused by the remaining recipient cells producing anti-erythrocyte antibodies (n = 2), and donor lymphocyte infusion induced pancytopenia (n = 1). The patients were aged from 17 to 48 years (median age 31 years). The underlying diseases of the patients were severe aplastic anemia in 12 patients, acute myelogenous leukemia in 3, acute lymphocytic leukemia in 3, and chronic myelogenous leukemia in 2. The donors were human leukocyte antigen-identical siblings in 18 cases, 1 mismatched related donor, and 1 unrelated donor. The cell source was bone marrow in 6 cases and peripheral blood progenitor cells in 14. The median interval between BMT and the boost treatment was 7 weeks (range 1-124). No conditioning regimen was given prior to the boost treatment for 11 patients, while 4 received total nodal irradiation (TNI) plus antithymocyte globulin (ATG), 3 ATG alone, and 2 TNI plus steroid. The median infused booster mononuclear cell dose was 2.55 x 10(8)/kg (range 0.28-37.0). Fifteen (75%) patients achieved a hematological recovery. After the boost treatment, 6 of 20 (30%) patients developed acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) > or = grade II, 3 of whom had had prior GVHD. Five (31.3%) of the evaluable 16 patients developed chronic GVHD. The GVHDs were easily controlled using immunosuppressive agents except in the case of 1 patient. Five patients died after the boost treatment; 2 within 30 days, 2 within 60 days, and 1 after 32 months. The causes of death were: 3 engraftment failures, 1 late rejection, and 1 infection following GVHD. With a median follow-up of 31.5 months (range 6-92), the Kaplan-Meier method estimated that the overall survival rate 1 and 3 years after the boost treatment was 80 and 71%, respectively. The survival of patients with primary graft failure was determined to be significantly lower compared to that of patients with secondary graft failure, using the log rank test (p = 0.0176). Disease category, stem cell source, conditioning prior to a boost treatment, and year of boost treatment did not have an influence on survival. We conclude that the reinfusion of donor stem cells is frequently successful in achieving engraftment with rare occurrence of fatal GVHD. Furthermore, relatively good long-term survival was demonstrated.","['Min, C K', 'Kim, D W', 'Lee, J W', 'Min, W S', 'Kim, C C']","['Min CK', 'Kim DW', 'Lee JW', 'Min WS', 'Kim CC']","['Catholic Hemopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation Center, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Switzerland,Acta Haematol,Acta haematologica,0141053,,IM,"['Actuarial Analysis', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Anemia, Aplastic/complications/therapy', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/*adverse effects/mortality', 'Cause of Death', 'Female', 'Graft Rejection/mortality/therapy', 'Graft vs Host Disease/mortality', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*mortality', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/complications/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Pancytopenia/etiology/therapy', 'Red-Cell Aplasia, Pure/etiology/therapy', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Rate', 'Transplantation, Homologous/adverse effects/mortality', 'Treatment Failure']",,2001/03/30 10:00,2001/05/22 10:01,['2001/03/30 10:00'],"['2001/03/30 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/05/22 10:01 [medline]', '2001/03/30 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Acta Haematol. 2000;104(4):185-92. doi: 10.1159/000046513.,,"['Copyright 2001 S.

The percentage of the granulocyte-macrophage-CSFr expression was high in M4 and M5, and granulocyte-CSFr-positive ANLL showed less extramedullary infiltration (p = 0.007) and more PGP expression. Ki-67 was expressed significantly less in refractory ANLL than initial ANLL and DNA topisomerase IIalpha was expressed significantly more in the surviving patients group.

The glutathione S-transferases (GST) detoxify various agents, including those implicated in MDS. Both GSTM(1) and GSTT(1) genes have ""null"" alleles and are polymorphic. We studied the impact of GTM(1) and GSTT(1) null genotypes on the MDS susceptibility, disease severity and laboratory indices with prognostic value for the syndrome. MATERIAL AND METHODS: In a hospital-based case-control study we analyzed lymphocyte DNA samples from 54 patients with MDS and 60 cancer-free controls matched for age, sex, smoking habits and origin. A multiplex polymerase chain reaction was used to genotype both GSTM(1) and GSTT(1) simultaneously. The chi(2) test was used for statistical evaluation of the data and the odds ratios and attributable risk and population attributable risk were also calculated. RESULTS: A significantly increased frequency of GSTM(1) null genotype was found among MDS patients (57.4%) compared to controls (33.3%) (p < 0.01), while the frequency of GSTT(1) null genotype was not significantly higher in MDS patients (11.1% vs. 6.66%). Neither GSTM(1) and GSTT(1) null genotype was associated with a particular category of the French-American-British (FAB) classification in the patients studied. Additionally, GSTM(1) null genotype was associated with a significant decrease in the absolute number of neutrophils among the MDS patients. CONCLUSIONS: Individuals with GSTM(1) null genotype may have increased susceptibility to MDS. Null genotypes do not seem to have be associated with FAB classification while they may be associated with putative prognostic factors.","['Tsabouri, S E', 'Georgiou, I', 'Alamanos, I', 'Bourantas, K L']","['Tsabouri SE', 'Georgiou I', 'Alamanos I', 'Bourantas KL']","['Hematology Unit, Department of Internal Medicine, Ioannina Medical School, University of Ioannina, GR-45002 Ioannina, Greece.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Switzerland,Acta Haematol,Acta haematologica,0141053,"['EC 2.5.1.- (glutathione S-transferase T1)', 'EC 2.5.1.18 (Glutathione Transferase)', 'EC 2.5.1.18 (glutathione S-transferase M1)']",IM,"['Age Factors', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Chi-Square Distribution', '*Gene Deletion', 'Genotype', 'Glutathione Transferase/*genetics', 'Matched-Pair Analysis', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/classification/epidemiology/*genetics', 'Odds Ratio', 'Prevalence', 'Sex Factors', 'Smoking']",,2001/03/30 10:00,2001/05/22 10:01,['2001/03/30 10:00'],"['2001/03/30 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/05/22 10:01 [medline]', '2001/03/30 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Acta Haematol. 2000;104(4):169-73. doi: 10.1159/000046510.,,"['Copyright 2001 S.

The cardiotoxicity of conventional anthracycline therapy highlights a need to search for methods that are highly sensitive and capable of predicting cardiac dysfunction. We measured the plasma level of brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) to determine whether BNP might serve as a simple diagnostic indicator of anthracycline-induced cardiotoxicity in patients with acute leukemia treated with a daunorubicin (DNR)-containing regimen. Thirteen patients with acute leukemia were treated with a DNR-containing regimen. Cardiac functions were evaluated with radionuclide angiography before chemotherapies. The plasma levels of atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) and BNP were measured at the time of radionuclide angiography. Three patients developed congestive heart failure after the completion of chemotherapy. Five patients were diagnosed as having subclinical heart failure after the completion of chemotherapy. The plasma levels of BNP in all the patients with clinical and subclinical heart failure increased above the normal limit (40 pg/ml) before the detection of clinical or subclinical heart failure by radionuclide angiography. On the other hand, BNP did not increase in the patients without heart failure given DNR, even at more than 700 mg/m(2). The plasma level of ANP did not always increase in all the patients with clinical and subclinical heart failure. These preliminary results suggest that BNP may be useful as an early and sensitive indicator of anthracycline-induced cardiotoxicity.","['Okumura, H', 'Iuchi, K', 'Yoshida, T', 'Nakamura, S', 'Takeshima, M', 'Takamatsu, H', 'Ikeno, A', 'Usuda, K', 'Ishikawa, T', 'Ohtake, S', 'Matsuda, T']","['Okumura H', 'Iuchi K', 'Yoshida T', 'Nakamura S', 'Takeshima M', 'Takamatsu H', 'Ikeno A', 'Usuda K', 'Ishikawa T', 'Ohtake S', 'Matsuda T']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Toyama Prefectural Central Hospital, Toyama, Japan. holumura@med.kanazawa-u.ac.jp']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Switzerland,Acta Haematol,Acta haematologica,0141053,"['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Biomarkers)', '114471-18-0 (Natriuretic Peptide, Brain)', '85637-73-6 (Atrial Natriuretic Factor)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/*toxicity', 'Atrial Natriuretic Factor/blood', 'Biomarkers/blood', 'Cardiac Output, Low/chemically induced/diagnosis', 'Daunorubicin/therapeutic use/toxicity', 'Female', 'Heart Diseases/*chemically induced/*diagnosis', 'Heart Failure/chemically induced/diagnosis', 'Heart Function Tests', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/complications/drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Natriuretic Peptide, Brain/*blood', 'Statistics, Nonparametric']",,2001/03/30 10:00,2001/05/22 10:01,['2001/03/30 10:00'],"['2001/03/30 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/05/22 10:01 [medline]', '2001/03/30 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Acta Haematol. 2000;104(4):158-63. doi: 10.1159/000046508.,,"['Copyright 2001 S.

Protein synthesis inhibition is required to sensitize the endothelium to lipopolysaccharide-induced apoptosis, suggesting that a constitutive or inducible cytoprotective protein(s) is required for endothelial survival. We have identified two known endothelial anti-apoptotic proteins, c-FLIP and Mcl-1, the expression of which is decreased markedly in the presence of cycloheximide. Decreased expression of both proteins preceded apoptosis evoked by lipopolysaccharide + cycloheximide. Caspase inhibition protected against apoptosis, but not the decreased expression of c-FLIP and Mcl-1, suggesting that they exert protection upstream of caspase activation. Inhibition of the degradation of these two proteins with the proteasome inhibitor, lactacystin, prevented lipopolysaccharide + cycloheximide-induced apoptosis. Similarly, lactacystin protected against endothelial apoptosis induced by either tumor necrosis factor-alpha or interleukin-1beta in the presence of cycloheximide. That apoptosis could be blocked in the absence of new protein synthesis by inhibition of the proteasome degradative pathway implicates the requisite involvement of a constitutively expressed protein(s) in the endothelial cytoprotective pathway. Finally, reduction of FLIP expression with antisense oligonucleotides sensitized endothelial cells to LPS killing, demonstrating a definitive role for FLIP in the protection of endothelial cells from LPS-induced apoptosis.","['Bannerman, D D', 'Tupper, J C', 'Ricketts, W A', 'Bennett, C F', 'Winn, R K', 'Harlan, J M']","['Bannerman DD', 'Tupper JC', 'Ricketts WA', 'Bennett CF', 'Winn RK', 'Harlan JM']","['Department of Medicine, University of Washington School of Medicine, Seattle, Washington 98104, USA. dbannerm@u.washington.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (CASP8 and FADD-Like Apoptosis Regulating Protein)', '0 (CFLAR protein, human)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (Interleukin-1)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Lipopolysaccharides)', '0 (Multienzyme Complexes)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Oligonucleotides, Antisense)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '98600C0908 (Cycloheximide)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Cysteine Endopeptidases)', 'EC 3.4.25.1 (Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Base Sequence', 'CASP8 and FADD-Like Apoptosis Regulating Protein', 'Carrier Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Cell Survival/physiology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cycloheximide/pharmacology', 'Cysteine Endopeptidases/drug effects', 'DNA Primers', 'Endothelium, Vascular/cytology/*drug effects/enzymology', 'Humans', 'Hydrolysis', 'Interleukin-1/pharmacology', '*Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins', 'Lipopolysaccharides/*pharmacology', 'Multienzyme Complexes/drug effects', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'NF-kappa B/physiology', 'Neoplasm Proteins/metabolism', 'Oligonucleotides, Antisense/pharmacology', 'Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex', '*Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/pharmacology']",,2001/03/30 10:00,2001/06/29 10:01,['2001/03/30 10:00'],"['2001/03/30 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/06/29 10:01 [medline]', '2001/03/30 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2001 May 4;276(18):14924-32. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M100819200.

Incubation of U937 cells with IFN-gamma sensitized these cells to apoptosis induced by tumor necrosis factor-alpha, agonistic CD95 antibody, and tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand. Other human myeloid leukemic cells were also sensitized by IFN-gamma to death receptor-mediated apoptosis. Treatment of U937 cells with IFN-gamma up-regulated the expression of caspase-8 and potently synergized with death receptor ligation in the processing of caspase-8 and BID cleavage. Concomitantly, a marked down-regulation of BCL-2 protein was also observed in cells incubated with IFN-gamma. Furthermore, the caspase-dependent generation of a 23-kDa fragment of BCL-2 protein, the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria and the activation of caspase-9 were also enhanced upon death receptor ligation in IFN-gamma-treated cells. Ectopically expressed Bcl-2 protein inhibited IFN-gamma-induced sensitization to apoptosis.

We show in this study that preimplantation embryo development became asynchronous in mice that are deficient in brain-type (CB1) and/or spleen-type (CB2) cannabinoid receptor genes. Furthermore, whereas the levels of uterine anandamide (endocannabinoid) and blastocyst CB1 are coordinately down-regulated with the onset of uterine receptivity and blastocyst activation prior to implantation, these levels remained high in the nonreceptive uterus and in dormant blastocysts during delayed implantation and in pregnant, leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF)-deficient mice with implantation failure. These results suggest that a tight regulation of endocannabinoid signaling is important for synchronizing embryo development with uterine receptivity for implantation. Indeed this is consistent with our finding that while an experimentally induced, sustained level of an exogenously administered, natural cannabinoid inhibited implantation in wild-type mice, it failed to do so in CB1(-/-)/CB2(-/-) double mutant mice. The present study is clinically important because of the widely debated medicinal use of cannabinoids and their reported adverse effects on pregnancy.","['Paria, B C', 'Song, H', 'Wang, X', 'Schmid, P C', 'Krebsbach, R J', 'Schmid, H H', 'Bonner, T I', 'Zimmer, A', 'Dey, S K']","['Paria BC', 'Song H', 'Wang X', 'Schmid PC', 'Krebsbach RJ', 'Schmid HH', 'Bonner TI', 'Zimmer A', 'Dey SK']","['Department of Pediatrics, Ralph L.

Although the precise mechanism of malignant transformation by Tax is unclear, it is well established that Tax represses the transcription function of the tumor suppressor p53, possibly accelerating the accumulation of genetic mutations that are critical in HTLV-I-mediated malignant transformation. Tax repression of p53 transcription function appears to occur, at least in part, through competition for the cellular coactivator CBP/p300. In this study, we characterize the effect of Tax on the p53 family member, p73. We demonstrate that Tax also represses the transcription function of p73beta and that the repression is reciprocal in vivo, consistent with the idea that both transcription factors may compete for CBP/p300 in vivo. We provide evidence showing that both Tax and p73 interact strongly with the C/H1 domain of CBP and that their binding to this region is mutually exclusive in vitro. This finding provides evidence supporting the idea that reciprocal transcriptional repression between Tax and p73 is mediated through coactivator competition.","['Lemasson, I', 'Nyborg, J K']","['Lemasson I', 'Nyborg JK']","['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Colorado State University, Fort Collins, Colorado 80523-1870, USA. il@lamar.colostate.edu']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (TP73 protein, human)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (Tumor Protein p73)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '98600C0908 (Cycloheximide)', 'EC 2.3.1.48 (CREB-Binding Protein)', 'EC 2.3.1.48 (CREBBP protein, human)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Binding Sites', 'Binding, Competitive', 'CREB-Binding Protein', 'Cycloheximide/pharmacology', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*metabolism', 'Gene Products, tax/*metabolism', 'Genes, Tumor Suppressor', 'Half-Life', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Kinetics', 'Nuclear Proteins/*metabolism', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/metabolism', 'Recombinant Proteins/metabolism', 'T-Lymphocytes/cytology/physiology', 'Trans-Activators/*metabolism', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Protein p73', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins']",,2001/03/30 10:00,2001/06/15 10:01,['2001/03/30 10:00'],"['2001/03/30 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/06/15 10:01 [medline]', '2001/03/30 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2001 May 11;276(19):15720-7. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M100131200.

Inhibition of phospholipase C with blocked calcium entry and I(crac) activation whether in response to a phospholipase C-coupled agonist or to calcium store depletion with thapsigargin. Run-down of cellular polyphosphoinositides by concentrations of wortmannin that block phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase completely blocked calcium entry and I(crac). The membrane-permeant IP(3) receptor inhibitor, 2-aminoethoxydiphenyl borane, blocked both capacitative calcium entry and I(crac). However, it is likely that 2-aminoethoxydiphenyl borane does not inhibit through an action on the IP(3) receptor because the drug was equally effective in wild-type DT40 B-cells and in DT40 B-cells whose genes for all three IP(3) receptors had been disrupted. Intracellular application of another potent IP(3) receptor antagonist, heparin, failed to inhibit activation of I(crac). Finally, the inhibition of I(crac) activation by or wortmannin was not reversed or prevented by direct intracellular application of IP(3). These findings indicate a requirement for phospholipase C and for polyphosphoinositides for activation of capacitative calcium entry. However, the results call into question the previously suggested roles of IP(3) and IP(3) receptor in this mechanism, at least in these particular cell types.","['Broad, L M', 'Braun, F J', 'Lievremont, J P', 'Bird, G S', 'Kurosaki, T', 'Putney, J W Jr']","['Broad LM', 'Braun FJ', 'Lievremont JP', 'Bird GS', 'Kurosaki T', 'Putney JW Jr']","['Laboratory of Signal Transduction, NIEHS, National Institutes of Health, Research Triangle Park, North Carolina 27709, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Androstadienes)', '0 (Boron Compounds)', '0 (Calcium Channels)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Estrenes)', '0 (Inositol 1,4,5-Trisphosphate Receptors)', '0 (Phosphatidylinositol Phosphates)', '0 (Pyrrolidinones)', '0 (Receptors, Cytoplasmic and Nuclear)', '112648-68-7', '(1-(6-((3-methoxyestra-1,3,5(10)-trien-17-yl)amino)hexyl)-1H-pyrrole-2,5-dione)', '67526-95-8 (Thapsigargin)', '85166-31-0 (Inositol 1,4,5-Trisphosphate)', '9005-49-6 (Heparin)', 'E4ES684O93 (2-aminoethoxydiphenyl borate)', 'EC 3.1.4.- (Type C Phospholipases)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)', 'XVA4O219QW (Wortmannin)']",IM,"['Androstadienes/pharmacology', 'Animals', 'B-Lymphocytes', 'Boron Compounds/pharmacology', 'Calcium/metabolism/*physiology', 'Calcium Channels/drug effects/genetics/physiology', 'Cell Line, Transformed', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chickens', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Estrenes/pharmacology', 'Heparin/pharmacology', 'Inositol 1,4,5-Trisphosphate/*metabolism', 'Inositol 1,4,5-Trisphosphate Receptors', 'Kinetics', 'Lacrimal Apparatus/cytology/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Basophilic, Acute', 'Mice', 'Phosphatidylinositol Phosphates/*metabolism', 'Pyrrolidinones/pharmacology', 'Rats', 'Receptors, Cytoplasmic and Nuclear/drug effects/genetics/physiology', 'Thapsigargin/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Type C Phospholipases/*metabolism', 'Wortmannin']",,2001/03/30 10:00,2001/06/15 10:01,['2001/03/30 10:00'],"['2001/03/30 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/06/15 10:01 [medline]', '2001/03/30 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2001 May 11;276(19):15945-52. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M011571200.

We therefore hypothesized that P-gp may have additional functions in addition to its role in effluxing xenotoxins that could provide protection to tumor cells against a host response. There have been a number of contradictory reports concerning the role of P-gp in regulating complement activation. Given the disparate results obtained by different laboratories and our published results demonstrating that P-gp does not affect cell death induced by another membranolytic protein, perforin, we decided to assess the role of P-gp in regulating cell lysis induced by a number of different pore-forming proteins. Testing a variety of different P-gp-expressing MDR cell lines produced following exposure of cells to chemotherapeutic agents or by retroviral gene transduction in the complete absence of any drug selection, we found no difference in sensitivity of P-gp(+ve) or P-gp(-ve) cells to the pore-forming proteins complement, perforin, or pneumolysin.

We recently determined that the majority of cases result from de novo or autosomal dominantly inherited heterozygous mutations in ELA2, encoding neutrophil elastase. Neutrophil elastase is a chymotryptic serine protease localized in granules of neutrophils and monocytes and is the major target of inhibition of the serpin alpha(1)-antitrypsin. The mutations causing severe congenital neutropenia consist of amino acid missense substitutions, in-frame deletion, splice donor mutation producing a deletion, splice acceptor mutation causing insertion of novel residues, and protein truncating mutations of the carboxyl terminus resulting from nonsense substitutions and deletions leading to frameshifts. We have expressed 14 mutant forms of neutrophil elastase in vitro and have characterized their biochemical properties. The mutations have variable effects on proteolytic activity, eliminating the possibility that the disease results from haploinsufficiency. There is no evidence that the mutant enzymes are cytotoxic. The mutant enzymes retain vulnerability to inhibition by alpha(1)-antitrypsin, but demonstrate variable avidity for interaction with this serpin. Somewhat surprisingly, the mutant enzymes inhibit the wild type enzyme when both are coexpressed within the same cell, suggesting the potential to interfere with normal subcellular trafficking or post-translational processing.","['Li, F Q', 'Horwitz, M']","['Li FQ', 'Horwitz M']","['Markey Molecular Medicine Center, Division of Medical Genetics, Department of Medicine, University of Washington School of Medicine, Seattle 98195, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Codon, Nonsense)', '0 (DNA, Complementary)', 'EC 3.4.21.37 (Leukocyte Elastase)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis', 'Blotting, Western', 'Codon, Nonsense', 'DNA, Complementary/metabolism', 'Exons', 'Frameshift Mutation', 'Gene Deletion', 'Genes, Dominant', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Heterozygote', 'Humans', 'Leukocyte Elastase/*chemistry/*genetics', 'Microscopy, Fluorescence', 'Models, Molecular', 'Monocytes/metabolism', '*Mutation', 'Mutation, Missense', 'Neutropenia/*congenital/*genetics', 'Precipitin Tests', 'Protein Conformation', 'Protein Processing, Post-Translational', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Rats', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,2001/03/30 10:00,2001/06/15 10:01,['2001/03/30 10:00'],"['2001/03/30 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/06/15 10:01 [medline]', '2001/03/30 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2001 Apr 27;276(17):14230-41. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M010279200.

TEL-mediated oligomerization of JAK2 results in constitutive activation of the tyrosine kinase (JH1) domain and confers cytokine-independent proliferation on interleukin-3-dependent Ba/F3 cells. Forced expression of the JAK inhibitor gene SOCS1/JAB/SSI-1 induced apoptosis of TEL-JAK2-transformed Ba/F3 cells. This suppression of TEL-JAK2 activity was dependent on SOCS box-mediated proteasomal degradation of TEL-JAK2 rather than on kinase inhibition. Degradation of JAK2 depended on its phosphorylation and its high affinity binding with SOCS1 through the kinase inhibitory region and the SH2 domain. It has been demonstrated that von Hippel-Lindau disease (VHL) tumor-suppressor gene product possesses the SOCS box that forms a complex with Elongin B and C and Cullin-2, and it functions as a ubiquitin ligase. The SOCS box of SOCS1/JAB has also been shown to interact with Elongins; however, ubiquitin ligase activity has not been demonstrated. We found that the SOCS box interacted with Cullin-2 and promoted ubiquitination of TEL-JAK2. Furthermore, overexpression of dominant negative Cullin-2 suppressed SOCS1-dependent TEL-JAK2 degradation. Our study demonstrates the substrate-specific E3 ubiquitin-ligase-like activity of SOCS1 for activated JAK2 and may provide a novel strategy for the suppression of oncogenic tyrosine kinases.","['Kamizono, S', 'Hanada, T', 'Yasukawa, H', 'Minoguchi, S', 'Kato, R', 'Minoguchi, M', 'Hattori, K', 'Hatakeyama, S', 'Yada, M', 'Morita, S', 'Kitamura, T', 'Kato, H', 'Nakayama Ki', 'Yoshimura, A']","['Kamizono S', 'Hanada T', 'Yasukawa H', 'Minoguchi S', 'Kato R', 'Minoguchi M', 'Hattori K', 'Hatakeyama S', 'Yada M', 'Morita S', 'Kitamura T', 'Kato H', 'Nakayama Ki', 'Yoshimura A']","['Institute of Life Science, Kurume University, Aikawa-machi 2432-3, Kurume 839-0861, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (CUL2 protein, human)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (Cullin Proteins)', '0 (ELOB protein, human)', '0 (Elob protein, mouse)', '0 (Elongin)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (SOCS1 protein, human)', '0 (Socs1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling 1 Protein)', '0 (Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling Proteins)', '0 (TEL-JAK2 fusion protein, human)', '0 (TEL-JAK2 fusion protein, mouse)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Ubiquitins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Binding Sites', 'Carrier Proteins/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Cell Cycle Proteins/metabolism', 'Cell Division', 'Cell Line', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 12', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 9', '*Cullin Proteins', 'Elongin', 'Humans', '*Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia/genetics', 'Mice', 'Mutagenesis', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/metabolism', 'Recombinant Proteins/metabolism', 'Repressor Proteins/metabolism', 'Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling 1 Protein', 'Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling Proteins', 'Transcription Factors/metabolism', 'Transfection', 'Ubiquitins/*metabolism', 'src Homology Domains']",,2001/03/30 10:00,2001/06/02 10:01,['2001/03/30 10:00'],"['2001/03/30 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/06/02 10:01 [medline]', '2001/03/30 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2001 Apr 20;276(16):12530-8. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M010074200.

We also show that CalDAG-GEF I encodes two protein isoforms, a full-length isoform (CalDAG-GEF Ia) and a C-terminally truncated isoform (CalDAG-GEF Ib). Expression of the full-length CalDAG-GEF Ia isoform in Rat2 fibroblasts enhances growth in low serum, whereas expression in Swiss 3T3 cells causes morphological transformation and increased saturation density. In FDCP1 myeloid cells, CalDAG-GEF Ia expression increases growth and saturation density in the presence of the diacylglycerol analogs phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), which activates CalDAG-GEF Ia exchange activity. Likewise, in 32Dcl3 myeloblast cells, CalDAG-GEF Ia expression increases cell adherence to fibronectin in response to PMA and calcium ionophore and allows higher saturation densities and prolonged growth on fibronectin-coated plates. These effects were correlated with increased Rap1, but not Ras, protein activation following PMA and calcium ionophore treatment. Our results suggest that Rap1-GTP delivers signals that favor progression through the cell cycle and morphological transformation. The identification of CalDAG-GEF I as a proto-oncogene in BXH-2 acute myeloid leukemia is the first evidence implicating Rap1 signaling in myeloid leukemia.","['Dupuy, A J', 'Morgan, K', 'von Lintig, F C', 'Shen, H', 'Acar, H', 'Hasz, D E', 'Jenkins, N A', 'Copeland, N G', 'Boss, G R', 'Largaespada, D A']","['Dupuy AJ', 'Morgan K', 'von Lintig FC', 'Shen H', 'Acar H', 'Hasz DE', 'Jenkins NA', 'Copeland NG', 'Boss GR', 'Largaespada DA']","['University of Minnesota Cancer Center, Institute of Human Genetics, and Department of Genetics, Cell Biology, and Development, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota 55455, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Guanine Nucleotide Exchange Factors)', '0 (MAS1 protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Mas)', '0 (RASGRP2 protein, human)', '0 (Rasgrp2 protein, mouse)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'DNA', 'Fibroblasts/metabolism', 'Guanine Nucleotide Exchange Factors/*genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*genetics/pathology', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Proto-Oncogene Mas', 'Rats', 'Signal Transduction', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,2001/03/30 10:00,2001/05/26 10:01,['2001/03/30 10:00'],"['2001/03/30 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/05/26 10:01 [medline]', '2001/03/30 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2001 Apr 13;276(15):11804-11. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M008970200.

To investigate possible consequences of this genetic alteration for tumor development, we conditionally expressed p16(INK4A) in the T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia line CCRF-CEM, which carries a homozygous deletion of this gene. In agreement with its reported function, p16(INK4A) expression was associated with hypophosphorylation of the retinoblastoma protein pRB and stable cell cycle arrest in G(0)/G(1), documenting that the pRB/E2F pathway is functional in these cells. Unexpectedly, p16(INK4A) expression increased the sensitivity threshold for glucocorticoid (GC)-induced apoptosis from therapeutic to physiologic levels. As a possible explanation for this phenomenon, we found that p16(INK4A)-arrested cells had elevated GC receptor expression associated with enhanced GC-mediated transcriptional activity and increased responsiveness of the GC-regulated cyclin D3 gene. These data are supported by our previous findings that GC receptor levels critically influence GC sensitivity and imply that p16(INK4A) inactivation, in addition to allowing unrestricted proliferation, represents a mechanism by which lymphoid tumor cells might escape cell death triggered by endogenous GC.","['Ausserlechner, M J', 'Obexer, P', 'Wiegers, G J', 'Hartmann, B L', 'Geley, S', 'Kofler, R']","['Ausserlechner MJ', 'Obexer P', 'Wiegers GJ', 'Hartmann BL', 'Geley S', 'Kofler R']","['Institute for General and Experimental Pathology, Division of Molecular Pathophysiology, University of Innsbruck Medical School and the Tyrolean Cancer Research Institute, A-6020 Innsbruck, Austria.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p16)', '0 (Glucocorticoids)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects/*genetics', 'Cell Cycle/*genetics', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p16/*genetics', 'Gene Deletion', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'Glucocorticoids/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Signal Transduction/genetics', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,2001/03/30 10:00,2001/06/02 10:01,['2001/03/30 10:00'],"['2001/03/30 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/06/02 10:01 [medline]', '2001/03/30 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2001 Apr 6;276(14):10984-9. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M008188200.

Here, we show that the human T cell leukemia Jurkat cells express an alternatively spliced form of PKR with a deletion of exon 7 (PKRDeltaE7), resulting in a truncated protein that retains the two dsRNA-binding motifs. PKRDeltaE7 exhibits a dominant negative function by inhibiting both PKR autophosphorylation and eukaryotic initiation factor 2 alpha-subunit phosphorylation in vitro and in vivo. Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction assays showed that PKRDeltaE7 is expressed in a broad range of human tissues at variable levels. Interestingly, expression of PKRDeltaE7 is higher in Jurkat cells than in normal peripheral blood mononuclear cells, raising the possibility of a role in cell proliferation and/or transformation. Thus, expression of alternatively spliced forms of PKR may represent a novel mechanism of PKR autoregulation with important implications in the control of cell proliferation.","['Li, S', 'Koromilas, A E']","['Li S', 'Koromilas AE']","['Lady Davis Institute for Medical Research, Sir Mortimer B.

To clarify the functional role of FKHRL1 in TPO signaling, we established a tetracycline-inducible system in the human TPO-dependent leukemia cell line UT-7/TPO. Induced expression of active FKHRL1 led to cell cycle arrest at G0/G1 phase in this cell line.

For most integrases, modifications of critical moieties in the major and minor grooves of these sequences decrease 3'-processing. However, for human immunodeficiency virus type-2 (HTLV-2) IN, the replacement of the guanine with 6-methylguanine or hypoxanthine not only reduced 3'-processing, but also promoted cleavage at a second site. This novel cleavage activity required an upstream ACA, unique to the HTLV-2 U5 end. 3'-Processing assays with additional isosteric modifications at Gua and filter binding experiments revealed that the mechanism of the second site cleavage differed among the major groove, minor groove, and mismatch modifications. Importantly, the decrease in 3'-processing activity noted with the minor groove and mismatch modifications were attributed to a decrease in binding. Major groove modifications, however, decreased the level of 3'-processing, but did not affect binding. This suggests that integrase binds the viral end through the minor groove, but relies on major groove contacts for 3'-processing. Several modifications were also examined in strand transfer and disintegration substrates. HTLV-2 IN showed reduced activity with strand transfer and disintegration substrates containing major groove, but not minor groove modifications. This suggests major groove interactions at guanine also provide an important role in these reactions.","['Wang, T', 'Piefer, A J', 'Jonsson, C B']","['Wang T', 'Piefer AJ', 'Jonsson CB']","['Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, New Mexico State University, Las Cruces, New Mexico 88003, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.7.- (Integrases)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'DNA, Viral/genetics/*metabolism', 'Escherichia coli/genetics', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 2/genetics/*metabolism', 'Integrases/genetics/*metabolism', 'Protein Binding', 'Recombinant Proteins/genetics/metabolism', '*Repetitive Sequences, Nucleic Acid']",,2001/03/30 10:00,2001/06/29 10:01,['2001/03/30 10:00'],"['2001/03/30 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/06/29 10:01 [medline]', '2001/03/30 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2001 May 4;276(18):14710-7. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M007754200.

Derivatives which bear a 2-(dimethylamino)ethylamino substituent, known to confer high DNA affinity, demonstrated cytotoxicity but not redox activity (beside the anthraquinone reduction). Conversely, derivatives which showed redox activity were not cytotoxic toward the P388 cell line. The results suggest that bioreduction is not the main mode of action in the cytotoxicity of anthraquinones.","['Barasch, D', 'Zipori, O', 'Ringel, I', 'Ginsburg, I', 'Samuni, A', 'Katzhendler, J']","['Barasch D', 'Zipori O', 'Ringel I', 'Ginsburg I', 'Samuni A', 'Katzhendler J']","['Department of Pharmaceutical Chemistry, The Hebrew University of Jerusalem, 91120, Jerusalem, Israel.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",France,Eur J Med Chem,European journal of medicinal chemistry,0420510,"['0 (Anthraquinones)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Free Radicals)', '0 (Intercalating Agents)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Anthraquinones/*chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Cell Line', 'Chemical Phenomena', 'Chemistry, Physical', 'DNA, Neoplasm/chemistry/drug effects', 'Free Radicals/*metabolism', 'Intercalating Agents/pharmacology', 'Leukemia P388/drug therapy/pathology', 'Macrophages/drug effects', 'Mice', 'Oxidation-Reduction']",,2001/03/30 10:00,2001/10/19 10:01,['2001/03/30 10:00'],"['2001/03/30 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/10/19 10:01 [medline]', '2001/03/30 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Eur J Med Chem. 1999 Jul-Aug;34(7-8):597-615. doi: 10.1016/s0223-5234(00)80029-x.,,,"['S0223-5234(99)00233-0 [pii]', '10.1016/s0223-5234(00)80029-x [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

OBJECTIVE: This study was undertaken to analyse the incidence of cutaneous lymphomas in Tokyo. METHODS: The clinical records and histologic material from 50 patients with lymphomas of the skin and 12 patients with lymphomatoid papulosis seen during the last 10 years at the Department of Dermatology, The Jikei University School of Medicine, Tokyo, have been reviewed. RESULTS: T-cell lymphomas including mycosis fungoides (MF)-Sezary's syndrome (SS) complex and adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATL) were more frequent than B-cell lymphomas. The incidence of ATL is associated with the number of human T-cell lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-1) carriers in the general population. Cutaneous B-cell lymphoma (CBCL) is not as rare as previously thought in Japan. CONCLUSIONS: Although the frequency of these cases depends on many unrelated factors, these values can provide a rough indication of the incidence of cutaneous lymphomas in Tokyo. The incidence of cutaneous lymphomas may be influenced by changes in environmental factors including viral infections.","['Ishiji, T', 'Takagi, Y', 'Niimura, M']","['Ishiji T', 'Takagi Y', 'Niimura M']","['Department of Dermatology, The Jikei University School of Medicine, Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Int J Dermatol,International journal of dermatology,0243704,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/pathology', 'Lymphoma/*pathology', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/pathology', 'Lymphoma, T-Cell, Cutaneous/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Outpatient Clinics, Hospital', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Sex Factors', 'Skin Neoplasms/*pathology', 'Tokyo']",,2001/03/30 10:00,2001/05/22 10:01,['2001/03/30 10:00'],"['2001/03/30 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/05/22 10:01 [medline]', '2001/03/30 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Int J Dermatol. 2001 Jan;40(1):37-40. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-4362.2001.00160.x.,,,"['ijd160 [pii]', '10.1046/j.1365-4362.2001.00160.x [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recently, p53 was shown to have an intrinsic 3'-->5' exonuclease activity. The current study has extended the characterization of purified wild-type recombinant p53-associated 3'-->5' exonuclease function to demonstrate proofreading activity. p53-associated 3'-->5' exonuclease shows clear preference for degradation of ssDNA over dsDNA substrate. On partial duplex structures, this exonucleolytic activity displays a marked preference for excision of a mismatched vs. a correctly paired 3' terminus which enables the p53 protein to act as a proofreader. However, p53 displays variation in excision of mismatched base pairs. The results demonstrate that p53 exhibits mispair excision with a specificity of A:A > A:G > A:C opposite the template adenine residue and with a specificity of G:A > G:G > G:T opposite the template guanine residue. Hence, the observed specificity of mismatch excision shows that p53 exonucleolytic proofreading preferentially repairs transversion mutations. As part of an investigation of the functional interaction between p53 and DNA polymerase, the influence of p53 on the accuracy of DNA synthesis was determined with exonuclease-deficient murine leukemia virus (MLV) reverse transcriptase (RT), representing a relatively low fidelity enzyme. Using an in vitro biochemical assay with 3'-terminal mismatch-containing DNA template primers, it was shown that wild-type recombinant p53 protein enhanced the DNA replication fidelity of MLV RT. A functional interaction between the exonuclease (p53) and polymerase (MLV RT) activities was observed; excision of mispairs by p53 was followed by further elongation onto correctly base-paired 3'-termini by MLV RT. Furthermore, the formation of 3'-mispair and subsequent mispair extension by the enzyme were decreased substantially in the presence of p53. The fact that the exonuclease-deficient MLV RT is more accurate in the presence of p53, suggests that p53 protein may function as an external proofreading exonuclease for viral enzyme. The observed decrease in initial nucleotide misincorporation and 3'-terminal mispair extension by MLV RT in the presence of p53, indicates the mechanism by which p53 affects the DNA replication fidelity of exonuclease-deficient DNA polymerase.","['Bakhanashvili, M']",['Bakhanashvili M'],"['Infectious Diseases Unit, Chaim Sheba Medical Center, Israel. unit@netvision.net.il']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Eur J Biochem,European journal of biochemistry,0107600,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase)', 'EC 2.7.7.7 (DNA-Directed DNA Polymerase)', 'EC 3.1.- (Exodeoxyribonucleases)', 'EC 3.1.11.5 (Exodeoxyribonuclease V)']",IM,"['Baculoviridae', 'Base Pair Mismatch', 'DNA Primers/metabolism', 'DNA Repair', 'DNA Replication', 'DNA-Directed DNA Polymerase/metabolism', 'Escherichia coli', 'Exodeoxyribonuclease V', 'Exodeoxyribonucleases/*physiology', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*enzymology', 'RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase/metabolism', 'Substrate Specificity', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/*physiology']",,2001/03/30 10:00,2001/05/18 10:01,['2001/03/30 10:00'],"['2001/03/30 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/05/18 10:01 [medline]', '2001/03/30 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Eur J Biochem. 2001 Apr;268(7):2047-54. doi: 10.1046/j.1432-1327.2001.02075.x.,,,"['ejb2075 [pii]', '10.1046/j.1432-1327.2001.02075.x [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The over-expression of this gene inhibits differentiation and induces the apoptosis of myeloid precursor cell lines. We overproduced in bacteria a truncated form of the encoded protein lacking the first 17 N-terminal amino acids. This truncated protein was called nucleoside diphosphate (NDP) kinase CDelta. NDP kinase CDelta had similar kinetic properties to the major human NDP kinases A and B, but was significantly more stable to denaturation by urea and heat. Analysis of denaturation by urea, using size exclusion chromatography, indicated unfolding without the dissociation of subunits, whereas renaturation occurred via a folded monomer. The stability of the protein depended primarily on subunit interactions. Homology modelling of the structure of NDP kinase CDelta, based on the crystal structure of NDP kinase B, indicated that NDP kinase CDelta had several additional stabilizing interactions. The overall structure of the two enzymes appears to be identical because NDP kinase CDelta readily formed mixed hexamers with NDP kinase A. It is possible that mixed hexamers can be observed in vivo.","['Erent, M', 'Gonin, P', 'Cherfils, J', 'Tissier, P', 'Raschella, G', 'Giartosio, A', 'Agou, F', 'Sarger, C', 'Lacombe, M L', 'Konrad, M', 'Lascu, I']","['Erent M', 'Gonin P', 'Cherfils J', 'Tissier P', 'Raschella G', 'Giartosio A', 'Agou F', 'Sarger C', 'Lacombe ML', 'Konrad M', 'Lascu I']","['Institut de Biochimie et Genetique Cellulaires (UMR 5095), Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique et Universite de Bordeaux-2, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Eur J Biochem,European journal of biochemistry,0107600,"['0 (Isoenzymes)', '0 (NM23 Nucleoside Diphosphate Kinases)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '8W8T17847W (Urea)', 'EC 2.7.4.6 (NME3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.4.6 (Nucleoside-Diphosphate Kinase)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (Monomeric GTP-Binding Proteins)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Blotting, Western', 'Catalysis', 'Enzyme Stability', 'Hot Temperature', 'Humans', 'Isoenzymes/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Models, Molecular', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Monomeric GTP-Binding Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'NM23 Nucleoside Diphosphate Kinases', 'Neuroblastoma/enzymology', 'Nucleoside-Diphosphate Kinase/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Protein Denaturation', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Urea/pharmacology']",,2001/03/30 10:00,2001/05/18 10:01,['2001/03/30 10:00'],"['2001/03/30 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/05/18 10:01 [medline]', '2001/03/30 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Eur J Biochem. 2001 Apr;268(7):1972-81. doi: 10.1046/j.1432-1327.2001.2076.doc.x.,,,"['ejb2076 [pii]', '10.1046/j.1432-1327.2001.2076.doc.x [doi]']",,,,,,"['GENBANK/AF153191', 'GENBANK/Q13232']",,,,,,,,

SAMPLE POPULATION: Tumor specimens from 15 dogs with various tumors, including malignant lymphoma (7 dogs), monocytic leukemia (1), mammary gland adenoma (1), mammary gland benign mixed tumor (1), rhabdomyosarcoma (1), colon cancer (1), and osteosarcoma (3). PROCEDURE: Aberrations of the p53 gene in these tumor tissues were examined by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction and single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis, using 3 fragments that covered the entire open reading frame of the canine p53 gene, followed by nucleotide sequencing of the abnormal bands. RESULTS: Point mutations, deletions, and insertions resulting in a number of amino acid substitutions of wild-type p53 were detected in 7 of the 15 tumor specimens from dogs with malignant lymphoma, monocytic leukemia, rhabdomyosarcoma, colon cancer, and osteosarcoma. Of these 7 dogs, 2 had aberrations of the p53 gene on both alleles, whereas 5 had aberrations of the p53 gene on 1 allele and concurrently lacked the wild-type p53 transcript. Many of the aberrations of the p53 gene detected in these tumors were located in the transactivation, DNA binding, and oligomerization domains. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Various naturally developing tumors in dogs often have inactivation of the p53 tumor suppressor gene, which may be 1 of the multiple step-wise genetic changes during tumorigenesis. This study indicates that p53 gene can be a target for gene therapy for tumors in dogs.","['Setoguchi, A', 'Sakai, T', 'Okuda, M', 'Minehata, K', 'Yazawa, M', 'Ishizaka, T', 'Watari, T', 'Nishimura, R', 'Sasaki, N', 'Hasegawa, A', 'Tsujimoto, H']","['Setoguchi A', 'Sakai T', 'Okuda M', 'Minehata K', 'Yazawa M', 'Ishizaka T', 'Watari T', 'Nishimura R', 'Sasaki N', 'Hasegawa A', 'Tsujimoto H']","['Department of Veterinary Internal Medicine, Graduate School of Agricultural and Life Sciences, University of Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Am J Vet Res,American journal of veterinary research,0375011,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Blotting, Southern', 'DNA, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Dog Diseases/*genetics', 'Dogs', 'Gene Deletion', 'Genes, p53/*genetics', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Neoplasms/genetics/*veterinary', 'Point Mutation', 'Polymorphism, Single-Stranded Conformational', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction/veterinary', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA']",,2001/03/30 10:00,2001/08/03 10:01,['2001/03/30 10:00'],"['2001/03/30 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/08/03 10:01 [medline]', '2001/03/30 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Am J Vet Res. 2001 Mar;62(3):433-9. doi: 10.2460/ajvr.2001.62.433.,,,['10.2460/ajvr.2001.62.433 [doi]'],,,,,,['GENBANK/AB020761'],,,,,,,,

The reasons for the accelerated neutrophil engraftment are not clear, but would be explained by increased self-replication of myeloid progenitor cells (CFU-GM). We have used a CFU-GM replating assay to investigate myeloid progenitor self-replication, and quantification of subcolony formation during erythroid burst formation to quantify erythroid progenitor self-renewal. Secondary colony formation by CFU-GM, grown from PBPC and then replated was increased compared with secondary colony formation by BM CFU-GM (P = 0.0001); erythroid subcolony formation was not altered. There was no difference between the replating abilities of PBPC CFU-GM derived from allogeneic donors (normal individuals) and autologous donors (patients with malignant disease) although differences were found between subgroups of autologous donors. The increased replication of PBPC could not be accounted for by a reduction in progenitor cell apoptosis; PBPC CFU-GM contained slightly fewer apoptotic CD34+ cells than BM CFU-GM. The increased replication by PBPC CFU-GM was reversible because it declined when CFU-GM colonies were passaged through three sequential CFU-GM replating cycles. This decline in self-replication was more rapid than the decline seen in replated BM CFU-GM. The self-replication of PBPC CFU-GM, and subcolony formation by BFU-E could be further enhanced by exposure to cytokines in vitro. We conclude that mobilisation alters the replication kinetics of myeloid, but not of erythroid, progenitor cells, that mobilisation-induced events are of limited duration and that in vitro exposure to cytokines may modify PBPC progenitor cell kinetics.","['Marley, S B', 'Lewis, J L', 'Zheng, B', 'Davidson, R J', 'Davis, J G', 'McDonald, C', 'Alenzi, F Q', 'Goldman, J M', 'Gordon, M Y']","['Marley SB', 'Lewis JL', 'Zheng B', 'Davidson RJ', 'Davis JG', 'McDonald C', 'Alenzi FQ', 'Goldman JM', 'Gordon MY']","['Leukaemia Research Fund Centre for Adult Leukaemia , Department of Hematology, Imperial College School of Medicine, London, UK.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Bone Marrow Transplant,Bone marrow transplantation,8702459,"['0 (Cytokines)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",IM,"['Blood Cells/cytology', 'Bone Marrow Cells/cytology', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'Cytokines/administration & dosage/pharmacology', 'Erythroid Precursor Cells/cytology/*drug effects', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/administration & dosage/pharmacology', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*therapy', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Mobilization', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Myeloid Progenitor Cells/cytology/*drug effects']",,2001/03/30 10:00,2001/06/29 10:01,['2001/03/30 10:00'],"['2001/03/30 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/06/29 10:01 [medline]', '2001/03/30 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Bone Marrow Transplant. 2001 Feb;27(3):241-8. doi: 10.1038/sj.bmt.1702777.,,,['10.1038/sj.bmt.1702777 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The cytokines produced by these cells were analyzed using immunohistochemical techniques, ribonuclease protection assays (RPA) and RT-PCR. We examined the capacity of these cloned cell lines to replace primary bone marrow-derived stromal cells in long-term bone marrow cultures (LT-BMC) and sought correlations between the capacity to support hematopoiesis in culture with the production of known cytokines. These immortalized lines replicate many of the functions of the hematopoietic microenvironment. They express cytokines known to play a role in hematopoiesis. All of the lines constitutively express mRNA for PBSF (SDF-1), macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF), stem cell factor (SCF), FLT-3, thrombopoietin (TPO), interleukin 7 (IL-7), leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), tumor necrosis factor-beta (TNF-beta), and interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma). Most lines also express granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) and G-CSF. They vary in their expression of IL-6, tumor growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1), TGF-beta2, and TNF-alpha. Growing these lines in the presence of cytokines that influence hematopoiesis alters the levels of cytokine message. The most striking effects were produced by TNF-alpha. In addition to the cytokine mRNAs, the cell lines express factors associated with bone formation such as osteoblast-specific factor-2 (OSF-2) and bone morphogenetic protein-1 (BMP-1). They also express the neural cell-adhesion molecule neuropilin and neurotrophic factors including nerve growth factor (NGF) and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). Several of the lines can maintain hematopoiesis in culture, as measured by the continuous production of myeloid colony-forming cells (CFU-c), for months. This capacity to support hematopoiesis does not correlate with any pattern of cytokine expression. Several of these lines also support the growth of human hematopoietic cells, and human CFU-c can be detected in the cultures in which CD34(+) bone marrow cells (BMC) are cultured on murine stromal cells. No correlation between the production of any of the known cytokines and the ability to support murine hematopoiesis was detected. In addition, there was no correlation between the capacity to support murine hematopoiesis and the capacity to maintain human HSC. Despite repeated cloning, the lines remain heterogeneous and are capable of producing cells with the properties of fibroblasts, osteoblasts, adipocytes, and myoblasts.

An immunotoxin (MDX-44) was constructed by coupling humanized anti-CD64 monoclonal antibody (mAb) H22 via a bivalent linker to deglycosylated ricin A-chain (RA). Human leukemia cell lines were incubated with MDX-44 or H22/free RA. The effect of MDX-44 on the proliferation of leukemia cells was assessed by [(3)H]thymidine incorporation. In the presence of interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma), MDX-44 significantly inhibited the proliferation of CD64(+) HL-60, NB4, and U937 cells in 72-h cultures in a dose-dependent manner. The mechanism of action appeared to be the induction of apoptosis, as measured by propidium iodide staining and flow cytometry analysis. However, CD64(-) KG-1a and Daudi cells were not affected by MDX-44/IFN-gamma. Incubating HL-60 cells with MDX-44/IFN-gamma resulted in a 99% decrease in colony-forming units, whereas colony-forming cells in normal bone marrow were not significantly suppressed by such treatment. Cells from 60% of AML patients (6/10) were inhibited by MDX-44/IFN-gamma, and the inhibition was correlated with CD64 expression on these cells (r = 0.65). In a human AML model in NOD/SCID mice, MDX-44/IFN-gamma inhibited 95-98% of peritoneal exudate AML cell proliferation and 85-90% of solid leukemia masses. The effect of MDX-44 on AML cells was dependent on activation of cells by IFN-gamma. MDX-44/IFN-gamma may have value in the therapy of AML cells expressing cell-surface CD64.","['Zhong, R K', 'van de Winkel, J G', 'Thepen, T', 'Schultz, L D', 'Ball, E D']","['Zhong RK', 'van de Winkel JG', 'Thepen T', 'Schultz LD', 'Ball ED']","['Department of Medicine, and the Cancer Center, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, CA 92093, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Hematother Stem Cell Res,Journal of hematotherapy & stem cell research,100892915,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Immunotoxins)', '0 (Receptors, IgG)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)', '9009-86-3 (Ricin)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/therapeutic use', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Interactions', 'Female', 'HL-60 Cells/transplantation', 'Humans', 'Immunotoxins/*therapeutic use', 'Interferon-gamma/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, SCID', 'Receptors, IgG/*immunology', 'Ricin/*therapeutic use', 'Stem Cells/drug effects', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects']",,2001/03/29 10:00,2001/09/08 10:01,['2001/03/29 10:00'],"['2001/03/29 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/09/08 10:01 [medline]', '2001/03/29 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Hematother Stem Cell Res. 2001 Feb;10(1):95-105. doi: 10.1089/152581601750098318.,,,['10.1089/152581601750098318 [doi]'],,['AI30389/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study we performed a detailed characterization of VEGF effects on native human AML blasts derived from a large group of consecutive AML patients with high blast counts in peripheral blood. Exogenous VEGF had divergent effects on spontaneous proliferation and cytokine-dependent (GM-CSF, G-CSF, IL-3) proliferation. Increased, decreased, or unaltered proliferation was observed in the presence of VEGF for various patients, and the VEGF effect differed even in the same patient depending on which exogenous cytokine being present together with VEGF. Similarly, increased, decreased or unaltered interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta) and IL-6 secretion was detected when VEGF was added, and for certain patients the effect of VEGF differed between IL-1beta and IL-6. Exogenous VEGF could also modulate proliferation and differentiation of clonogenic AML progenitors. Constitutive AML blast secretion of VEGF was detected for 40% of patients. Leptin, Flt3-L, IL-4, IL-10, and IL-13 had divergent effects on VEGF release by AML blasts. These results suggest that VEGF can modulate AML blast functions in vivo for a subset of patients. Furthermore, the detection of VEGF in peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC) autografts suggests that VEGF may influence the proliferation and possibly also the survival of contaminating AML cells in PBSC autografts. We conclude that VEGF may influence the functional characteristics of AML cells. Our results suggest that VEGF is important in leukemic hematopoiesis, and the detection of VEGF in PBSC autografts indicates that VEGF may influence the functional phenotype of contaminating AML cells in these grafts.","['Foss, B', 'Mentzoni, L', 'Bruserud , O']","['Foss B', 'Mentzoni L', 'Bruserud O']","['Institute of Medicine, The University of Bergen and Haukeland University Hospital, N-5021 Bergen, Norway.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Hematother Stem Cell Res,Journal of hematotherapy & stem cell research,100892915,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Endothelial Growth Factors)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A)', '0 (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factors)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Blood Component Removal', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cell Culture Techniques/methods', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cytokines/metabolism', 'Endothelial Growth Factors/*blood/*pharmacology', 'Female', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/blood/*pathology', 'Lymphokines/*blood/*pharmacology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Transplantation, Autologous', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factors']",,2001/03/29 10:00,2001/09/08 10:01,['2001/03/29 10:00'],"['2001/03/29 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/09/08 10:01 [medline]', '2001/03/29 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Hematother Stem Cell Res. 2001 Feb;10(1):81-93. doi: 10.1089/152581601750098291.,,,['10.1089/152581601750098291 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Two receptors, TGFbetaRI and TGFbetaRII, govern the interaction between the cell and the TGF-beta ligand. Primary binding of the ligand occurs with the RII receptor, promoting formation of a heterodimer with RI and activation of signaling. This induces transient association of Smad proteins with the receptors. Smad 3 and 4 may be involved in the TGF-beta-induced G(1) arrest. TGF-beta(1) down-regulates G(1) and G(2) cyclin-dependent kinases (cdks) and cyclins in terms of both kinase activity and protein amount. TGF- beta (1) also inhibits phosphorylation of the product of the retinoblastoma tumor suppressor gene (pRb) at multiple serine and threonine residues in human myeloid leukemia cells. The underphosphorylated pRb associates with transcription factor E2F-4 in G(1) phase, whereas the phosphorylated pRb mainly binds to E2F-1 and E2F-3. Because TGF-beta(1) up-regulates p130(pRb family member)/E2F-4 complex formation and down-regulates p107(pRb family member)/E2F-4 complex formation, with E2F-4 levels remaining constant, these results suggest that E2F-4 is switched from p107 to pRb and p130 when cells exit from the cell cycle and arrest in G(1) by the action of TGF-beta(1). The ""cdk inhibitor"" p27 is both a positive and a negative regulator of TGF-beta(1)-mediated cell cycle control. Although TGF-beta(1) has been reported to be a selected inhibitor of normal primitive hematopoietic stem cells, TGF-beta inhibits both primitive and more differentiated myeloid leukemia cell lines.","['Hu, X', 'Zuckerman, K S']","['Hu X', 'Zuckerman KS']","['Interdisciplinary Oncology Program, University of South Florida, and H.

This resulted in a spectrum of increases in the ic50 values of antifolates upon continuous exposure to drugs [Lometrexol (DDATHF) (70x) > trimetrexate (TMQ) (30x), multitargeted antifolate, LY231514 (ALIMTA) (30x) > Raltitrexed, Tomudex (ZD1694) (10x), 6R-2',5'-thienyl-5,10-dideazatetrahydrofolic acid (LY309887) (10x) > methotrexate (MTX) (6x) > (2S)-2-[o-fluoro-p-[N-(2,7-dimethyl-4-oxo-3,4-dihydroquinazolin-6-ylmethyl)-N-(pr op-2-ynyl)amino]benzamido]-4-(tetrazol-5-yl) butyric acid (ZD9331) (3x), N(alpha)-(4-amino-4-deoxypteroyl)-N(delta)-hemiphthaloyl-l-ornithine (PT523) (3x)]. Upon a 4-hr pulse exposure to drug, the ic50 values for DDATHF and ALIMTA were increased > 180- and 5-fold, respectively, with only a 2.5-fold increase in the extracellular 5-CHO-THF level within the physiological range. The reductions in drug sensitivities could be attributed to decreases in accumulation of polyglutamate derivatives of ALIMTA and DDATHF. Hence, in these studies, natural folates diminished the activity of agents that undergo polyglutamation by suppression of the formation of these active congeners at the level of folylpolyglutamate synthetase. For inhibitors of dihydrofolate reductase, the suppressive effect of endogenous folates appears to be due to competition between the antifolate and dihydrofolate at the level of the target enzyme. These data should be carefully considered in the design of regimens with antifolates, which incorporate co-administration of folates.","['Zhao, R', 'Gao, F', 'Goldman, I D']","['Zhao R', 'Gao F', 'Goldman ID']","['Department of Medicine, and The Albert Einstein Comprehensive Cancer Center, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Chanin 2, 1300 Morris Park Ave., Bronx, NY10461, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Biochem Pharmacol,Biochemical pharmacology,0101032,"['0 (Folic Acid Antagonists)', '25513-46-6 (Polyglutamic Acid)', '935E97BOY8 (Folic Acid)', 'Q573I9DVLP (Leucovorin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Biological Transport/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Folic Acid/*metabolism', 'Folic Acid Antagonists/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Leucovorin/*metabolism', 'Leukemia L1210', 'Mice', 'Polyglutamic Acid/chemistry', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,2001/03/29 10:00,2001/04/21 10:01,['2001/03/29 10:00'],"['2001/03/29 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/04/21 10:01 [medline]', '2001/03/29 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Biochem Pharmacol. 2001 Apr 1;61(7):857-65. doi: 10.1016/s0006-2952(01)00532-9.,,,"['S0006-2952(01)00532-9 [pii]', '10.1016/s0006-2952(01)00532-9 [doi]']",,"['CA-39807/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-82621/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,

The aim of this study was to investigate the feasibility of low-intensity conditioning for BMT from matched unrelated donors. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Sixteen patients with hematologic malignancies underwent non-T-cell-depleted BMT following a low-intensity conditioning regimen consisting of fludarabine monophosphate 30 mg/m(2)/day for 6 days, busulfan 4 mg/kg/day for 2 days, anti-T lymphocyte globulin 10 mg/kg/day for 4 days. Seven of the patients suffered from chronic myelogenous leukemia, four from acute lymphoblastic leukemia, four from acute myelogenous leukemia, and one from Ki-1 non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Three of the patients had secondary leukemia and two were post-autologous BMT (ABMT). All patients were transplanted from fully matched unrelated donors. RESULTS: Fifteen of the 16 patients had 100% donor chimerism; no graft rejection was observed. None of the patients developed >Grade II veno-occlusive disease, sepsis, multiorgan failure, or renal or pulmonary toxicity. Four patients died posttransplant; one of thrombocytopenia and severe hemorrhagic cystitis, one of central nervous system toxicity, one of Grade IV graft-vs-host disease, and one following relapse (9 months post-BMT). Survival and disease-free survival at 36 months are 75% (95% confidence interval 46-90%) and 60% (95% confidence interval 30-80%), respectively. CONCLUSION: These results indicate that low-intensity conditioning is sufficient to ensure stable engraftment of bone marrow grafts in a matched unrelated setting.","['Nagler, A', 'Aker, M', 'Or, R', 'Naparstek, E', 'Varadi, G', 'Brautbar, C', 'Slavin, S']","['Nagler A', 'Aker M', 'Or R', 'Naparstek E', 'Varadi G', 'Brautbar C', 'Slavin S']","['Department of Bone Marrow Transplantation, Hadassah University Hospital, The Hebrew University-Hadassah School of Medicine, Jerusalem, Israel. nagler@hadassah.org.il']",['eng'],"['Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,"['0 (Antilymphocyte Serum)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'G1LN9045DK (Busulfan)', 'P2K93U8740 (fludarabine)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antilymphocyte Serum/*administration & dosage', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/adverse effects/*methods/mortality', 'Busulfan/*administration & dosage', 'Cell Count', 'Child', 'Cohort Studies', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Graft Survival', 'Histocompatibility', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/mortality/therapy', 'Life Tables', 'Lymphoma, Large-Cell, Anaplastic/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Recurrence', 'Survival Analysis', 'T-Lymphocytes', 'Transplantation Conditioning/adverse effects/*methods', 'Transplantation, Homologous/adverse effects/*methods/mortality', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Vidarabine/*administration & dosage/*analogs & derivatives']",,2001/03/29 10:00,2001/05/01 10:01,['2001/03/29 10:00'],"['2001/03/29 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/05/01 10:01 [medline]', '2001/03/29 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Exp Hematol. 2001 Mar;29(3):362-70. doi: 10.1016/s0301-472x(00)00655-x.,,,"['S0301-472X(00)00655-X [pii]', '10.1016/s0301-472x(00)00655-x [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A general understanding of BCR/ABL signaling events is emerging, but little is known about the endogenous inhibitors of p210 BCR/ABL. The present study focused attention on CIS1, a cytokine-inducible SH2 protein, as a potential physiologic antagonist for BCR/ABL. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The murine hematopoietic cell line NSF/N1.H7 stably transfected with BCR/ABL was compared to the parental counterparts for induction of CIS1 by immunoblotting and immunoprecipitation. Cells were treated with a proteasome inhibitor to examine the effect of a proteasome inhibitor on CIS1 protein expression. To determine the effect of CIS1 on BCR/ABL-mediated transformation, we generated Rat-1 fibroblasts transfected with either a control vector, CIS1, BCR/ABL p210, or CIS1 plus BCR/ABL p210. RESULTS: Three forms of CIS1 with molecular masses of 32, 37, and 47 kDa were detected in BCR/ABL-transformed cells. The 47-kDa protein was a ubiquitinated protein. The proteasome inhibitor increased the formation of complexes between CIS1 and BCR/ABL. Transformation of p210 BCR/ABL was significantly suppressed in cells overexpressing CIS1. CONCLUSION: The results suggest that CIS1 is an endogenous inhibitor of p210 BCR/ABL and is likely to be important in the pathogenesis of Ph-positive leukemia.","['Tauchi, T', 'Yoshimura, A', 'Ohyashiki, K']","['Tauchi T', 'Yoshimura A', 'Ohyashiki K']","['First Department of Internal Medicine, Tokyo Medical University, Tokyo, Japan. tauchi@tokyo-med.ac.jp']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Immediate-Early Proteins)', '0 (Milk Proteins)', '0 (Multienzyme Complexes)', '0 (Protein Isoforms)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (STAT5 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling Proteins)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (Ubiquitins)', '0 (cytokine inducible SH2-containing protein)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Cysteine Endopeptidases)', 'EC 3.4.25.1 (Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex)']",IM,"['3T3 Cells/pathology', 'Animals', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/*drug effects', 'Cysteine Endopeptidases/*physiology', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/metabolism', 'Fibroblasts/pathology', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/physiology', 'Humans', 'Immediate-Early Proteins/biosynthesis/chemistry/isolation & purification/*physiology', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*metabolism', 'Mice', '*Milk Proteins', 'Molecular Weight', 'Multienzyme Complexes/*physiology', 'Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Isoforms/chemistry/isolation & purification/*physiology', '*Protein Processing, Post-Translational', 'Rats', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/physiology', 'STAT5 Transcription Factor', 'Signal Transduction', 'Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling Proteins', 'Trans-Activators/metabolism', 'Transfection', 'Ubiquitins/*metabolism', 'src Homology Domains']",,2001/03/29 10:00,2001/05/01 10:01,['2001/03/29 10:00'],"['2001/03/29 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/05/01 10:01 [medline]', '2001/03/29 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Exp Hematol. 2001 Mar;29(3):356-61. doi: 10.1016/s0301-472x(00)00673-1.,,,"['S0301-472X(00)00673-1 [pii]', '10.1016/s0301-472x(00)00673-1 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The integrin VLA-4 mediates HPC adhesion to BM stroma by interacting with CS-1/fibronectin and VCAM-1. It is required during hematopoiesis and homing of HPC to the BM. As HPC migration in response to SDF-1alpha might require dynamic regulation of integrin function, we investigated if SDF-1alpha could modulate VLA-4 function on BM CD34(hi) cells.CD34(hi) BM cells and hematopoietic cell lines were tested for the effect of SDF-1alpha on VLA-4-dependent adhesion to CS-1/fibronectin and VCAM-1, as well as to BM stroma. CD34(hi) BM cells that adhered to VLA-4 ligands after SDF-1alpha treatment were characterized in colony-forming and long-term culture-initiating cell (LTC-IC) assays.SDF-1alpha rapidly (1 minute) and transiently upregulated the adhesion of CD34(hi) BM cells and hematopoietic cell lines to both CS-1/fibronectin and VCAM-1, and to BM stromal cells. The upregulation of VLA-4-dependent cell adhesion by SDF-1alpha targeted primitive LTC-IC as well as committed CD34(hi) cells. SDF-1alpha-triggered enhancement in VLA-4 function was inhibited by pertussis toxin (PTx) and cytochalasin D, indicating the involvement of G(i) protein downstream signaling and an intact cytoskeleton. Instead, activation of p44/42 MAP kinases by SDF-1alpha did not functionally correlate with enhancement of VLA-4-dependent cell adhesion. Modulation of VLA-4-mediated CD34(hi) BM cell adhesion by SDF-1alpha could play a key role in their migration within and to the BM and therefore influence their proliferation and differentiation.","['Hidalgo, A', 'Sanz-Rodriguez, F', 'Rodriguez-Fernandez, J L', 'Albella, B', 'Blaya, C', 'Wright, N', 'Cabanas, C', 'Prosper, F', 'Gutierrez-Ramos, J C', 'Teixido, J']","['Hidalgo A', 'Sanz-Rodriguez F', 'Rodriguez-Fernandez JL', 'Albella B', 'Blaya C', 'Wright N', 'Cabanas C', 'Prosper F', 'Gutierrez-Ramos JC', 'Teixido J']","['Centro de Investigaciones Biologicas, Department of Immunology, Madrid, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (CXCL12 protein, human)', '0 (Chemokine CXCL12)', '0 (Chemokines, CXC)', '0 (Cxcl12 protein, mouse)', '0 (FN-H89 fibronectin fragment)', '0 (Fibronectins)', '0 (Hematopoietic Cell Growth Factors)', '0 (Integrin alpha4beta1)', '0 (Integrins)', '0 (Peptide Fragments)', '0 (Receptors, CXCR4)', '0 (Receptors, Lymphocyte Homing)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Vascular Cell Adhesion Molecule-1)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/pharmacology', 'Bone Marrow Cells/drug effects/metabolism', 'Cell Adhesion/*drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Chemokine CXCL12', 'Chemokines, CXC/pharmacology/*physiology', 'Chemotaxis/drug effects', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'Fibronectins/*metabolism', 'Hematopoietic Cell Growth Factors/pharmacology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Integrin alpha4beta1', 'Integrins/*physiology', 'Leukemia, Megakaryoblastic, Acute/pathology', 'Liver/cytology/embryology', 'Mice', 'Peptide Fragments/*metabolism', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/pathology', 'Receptors, CXCR4/metabolism', 'Receptors, Lymphocyte Homing/*physiology', 'Recombinant Proteins/pharmacology', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Stromal Cells/physiology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects/metabolism', 'Vascular Cell Adhesion Molecule-1/*metabolism']",,2001/03/29 10:00,2001/05/01 10:01,['2001/03/29 10:00'],"['2001/03/29 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/05/01 10:01 [medline]', '2001/03/29 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Exp Hematol. 2001 Mar;29(3):345-55. doi: 10.1016/s0301-472x(00)00668-8.,,,"['S0301-472X(00)00668-8 [pii]', '10.1016/s0301-472x(00)00668-8 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

MATERIALS AND METHODS: NOD/SCID mice were inoculated intravenously with primary ALL. Progression of leukemia was monitored throughout the development of disease by determination of absolute leukemic cell counts (LCC) in peripheral blood. RESULTS: LCC as low as 10(4) leukemic cells/mL blood could be detected. ALL cells from 5 of 5 patients engrafted, and after identification of the first leukemic cells in peripheral blood, LCC increased exponentially. Leukemic cells showed specificity of homing to spleen and bone marrow, and LCC strongly correlated with the level of leukemic engraftment in these organs throughout disease progression, demonstrating that LCC are representative for overall leukemic burden. Cytogenetic analysis of leukemic cells recovered after six successive in vivo transfers revealed no major karyotypic changes as compared to primary cells, and selection of the dominant clones was observed. This selection process was reflected by an increase in the rate of leukemic progression as compared to the first inoculation, demonstrating the accuracy with which kinetics of leukemic progression can be studied by determination of LCC.

Activin A is a TGF-beta family member involved in the regulation of growth and differentiation of various types of cells, such as those of the hematopoietic system. Its biological activity is antagonized by binding with follistatin. We investigated the binding of FLRG to activin A and the expression pattern of FLRG, follistatin, and activin A during hematopoiesis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The binding of FLRG with activin A was investigated by immunoprecipitation and Far-Western blot analysis. Gene expression was analyzed by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and Northern Blot in purified hematopoietic populations. RESULTS: We demonstrate that FLRG, like follistatin, is able to bind to activin A. In bone marrow stromal cells, both mRNA and protein FLRG levels were found to be dramatically increased by TGF-beta. FLRG and activin A are expressed in the same cells, with a higher level of expression in the myeloid cells compared with the erythroid and megakaryocytic cells. FLRG and follistatin expression were different in the hematopoietic subpopulations tested. Moreover, we observed that FLRG and activin A expression was up-regulated during hematopoiesis. CONCLUSION: FLRG and activin A are expressed in the same hematopoietic cells and regulated by TGF-beta. Moreover, FLRG interacts with activin A, suggesting that FLRG, like follistatin, participates in the diverse regulatory functions of activin A, such as those in hematopoiesis.","['Maguer-Satta, V', 'Bartholin, L', 'Jeanpierre, S', 'Gadoux, M', 'Bertrand, S', 'Martel, S', 'Magaud, J P', 'Rimokh, R']","['Maguer-Satta V', 'Bartholin L', 'Jeanpierre S', 'Gadoux M', 'Bertrand S', 'Martel S', 'Magaud JP', 'Rimokh R']","[""Unite INSERM U453, Departement d'Oncologie Fondamentale et Appliquee, Centre Leon Berard, 69373, Lyon, France. maguer@lyon.fnclcc.fr""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,"['0 (Follistatin)', '0 (Follistatin-Related Proteins)', '0 (Glycoproteins)', '0 (Ligands)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Transforming Growth Factor beta)', '104625-48-1 (Activins)', '57285-09-3 (Inhibins)']",IM,"['Activins', 'Animals', 'Blotting, Northern', 'Blotting, Western', 'Bone Marrow Cells/drug effects/metabolism', 'COS Cells', 'Chlorocebus aethiops', 'Follistatin', 'Follistatin-Related Proteins', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental/*physiology', 'Glycoproteins/*biosynthesis/genetics/metabolism', 'Hematopoiesis/*physiology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Inhibins/*metabolism', 'Ligands', 'Megakaryocytes/drug effects/metabolism', 'Myeloid Cells/metabolism', 'Precipitin Tests', 'Protein Binding', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/physiology', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Stromal Cells/metabolism', 'Transfection', 'Transforming Growth Factor beta/*physiology', 'U937 Cells']",,2001/03/29 10:00,2001/05/01 10:01,['2001/03/29 10:00'],"['2001/03/29 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/05/01 10:01 [medline]', '2001/03/29 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Exp Hematol. 2001 Mar;29(3):301-8. doi: 10.1016/s0301-472x(00)00675-5.,,,"['S0301472X00006755 [pii]', '10.1016/s0301-472x(00)00675-5 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,['Exp Hematol 2001 Jul;29(7):922'],,,,,

The modular organization of the envelope protein of C type retroviruses has been exploited to investigate how binding of the surface subunit (SU) to receptor triggers fusion mediated by the transmembrane (TM) subunit. We show that deletion of the receptor-binding domain (RBD) from SU of Friend murine leukemia virus (Fr-MLV) abolishes infection that is restored by supplying RBD as a soluble protein. Infection by this mechanism remains dependent on receptor expression. When membrane attachment of the virus lacking RBD is reestablished by inserting the hormone erythropoietin, infection remains dependent on the RBD/receptor complex. However, infection increases 50-fold to 5 x 10(5) units/ml on cells that also express the erythropoietin receptor. Soluble RBD from Fr-MLV also restores infection by amphotropic and xenotropic MLVs in which RBD is deleted. These experiments demonstrate that RBD has two functions: mediating virus attachment and activating the fusion mechanism. In addition, they indicate that receptor engagement triggers fusion by promoting a subgroup-independent functional interaction between RBD and the remainder of SU and/or TM.","['Barnett, A L', 'Davey, R A', 'Cunningham, J M']","['Barnett AL', 'Davey RA', 'Cunningham JM']","[""Department of Medicine and Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, MA 02115, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,['0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)'],IM,"['Cell Line, Transformed', 'Humans', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*chemistry', 'Models, Molecular', 'Plasmids/genetics', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Viral Envelope Proteins/*chemistry']",,2001/03/29 10:00,2001/05/05 10:01,['2001/03/29 10:00'],"['2001/03/29 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/05/05 10:01 [medline]', '2001/03/29 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2001 Mar 27;98(7):4113-8. doi: 10.1073/pnas.071432398.,,,"['10.1073/pnas.071432398 [doi]', '98/7/4113 [pii]']",PMC31188,"['U01 AI061246/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', '2RO1CA/AI61246-06/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Pediatric leukemia patients (n = 253 total) and healthy newborn controls (n = 200) were genotyped for MTHFR polymorphisms at nucleotides 677 (C-->T) and 1,298 (A-->C). A significant association for carriers of C677T was demonstrated for leukemias with MLL translocations (MLL+, n = 37) when compared with controls [adjusted odd ratios (OR) = 0.36 with a 95% confidence interval (CI) of 0.15-0.85; P = 0.017]. This protective effect was not evident for A1298C alleles (OR = 1.14). In contrast, associations for A1298C homozygotes (CC; OR = 0.26 with a 95% CI of 0.07--0.81) and C677T homozygotes (TT; OR = 0.49 with a 95% CI of 0.20--1.17) were observed for hyperdiploid leukemias (n = 138). No significant associations were evident for either polymorphism with TEL-AML1+ leukemias (n = 78). These differences in allelic associations may point to discrete attributes of the two alleles in their ability to alter folate and one-carbon metabolite pools and impact after DNA synthesis and methylation pathways, but should be viewed cautiously pending larger follow-up studies. The data provide evidence that molecularly defined subgroups of pediatric leukemias have different etiologies and also suggest a role of folate in the development of childhood leukemia.","['Wiemels, J L', 'Smith, R N', 'Taylor, G M', 'Eden, O B', 'Alexander, F E', 'Greaves, M F']","['Wiemels JL', 'Smith RN', 'Taylor GM', 'Eden OB', 'Alexander FE', 'Greaves MF']","['Leukaemia Research Fund Centre, Institute of Cancer Research, London SW3 6JB, United Kingdom. jwiemels@epi.ucsf.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['EC 1.5.- (Oxidoreductases Acting on CH-NH Group Donors)', 'EC 1.5.1.20 (Methylenetetrahydrofolate Reductase (NADPH2))']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Humans', 'Methylenetetrahydrofolate Reductase (NADPH2)', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Oxidoreductases Acting on CH-NH Group Donors/*genetics', 'Polymorphism, Genetic', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/classification/epidemiology/*genetics', 'Risk Factors']",,2001/03/29 10:00,2001/05/22 10:01,['2001/03/29 10:00'],"['2001/03/29 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/05/22 10:01 [medline]', '2001/03/29 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2001 Mar 27;98(7):4004-9. doi: 10.1073/pnas.061408298.

We recently reported that human immune cells express SP and its receptor. We have now investigated the possible role that SP and its receptor plays in HIV infection of human mononuclear phagocytes. SP enhanced HIV replication in human blood-isolated mononuclear phagocytes, whereas the nonpeptide SP antagonist (CP-96,345) potently inhibited HIV infectivity of these cells in a concentration-dependent fashion. CP-96,345 prevented the formation of typical giant syncytia induced by HIV Bal strain replication in these cells. This inhibitory effect of CP-96,345 was because of the antagonism of neurokinin-1 receptor, a primary SP receptor. Both CP-96,345 and anti-SP antibody inhibited SP-enhanced HIV replication in monocyte-derived macrophages (MDM). Among HIV strains tested (both prototype and primary isolates), only the R5 strains (Bal, ADA, BL-6, and CSF-6) that use the CCR5 coreceptor for entry into MDM were significantly inhibited by CP-96,345; in contrast, the X4 strain (UG024), which uses CXCR4 as its coreceptor, was not inhibited. In addition, the M-tropic ADA (CCR5-dependent)-pseudotyped HIV infection of MDM was markedly inhibited by CP-96,345, whereas murine leukemia virus-pseudotyped HIV was not affected, indicating that the major effect of CP-96,345 is regulated by Env-determined early events in HIV infection of MDM. CP-96,345 significantly down-regulated CCR5 expression in MDM at both protein and mRNA levels. Thus, SP-neurokinin-1 receptor interaction may play an important role in the regulation of CCR5 expression in MDM, affecting the R5 HIV strain infection of MDM.","['Lai, J P', 'Ho, W Z', 'Zhan, G X', 'Yi, Y', 'Collman, R G', 'Douglas, S D']","['Lai JP', 'Ho WZ', 'Zhan GX', 'Yi Y', 'Collman RG', 'Douglas SD']","[""Division of Immunologic and Infectious Diseases, Joseph Stokes, Jr., Research Institute, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, PA 19104-4399, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (Anti-HIV Agents)', '0 (Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal)', '0 (Biphenyl Compounds)', '0 (Neurokinin-1 Receptor Antagonists)', '0 (Receptors, Neurokinin-1)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '33507-63-0 (Substance P)', 'W22ILA2I52 (CP 96345)']",IM,"['Anti-HIV Agents/*pharmacology', 'Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal/pharmacology', 'Biphenyl Compounds/*pharmacology', 'Drug Interactions', 'Genes, Reporter', 'HIV Long Terminal Repeat/drug effects', 'HIV-1/*drug effects/physiology', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Neuroimmunomodulation', 'Neurokinin-1 Receptor Antagonists', 'Phagocytes/*drug effects/virology', 'Receptors, Neurokinin-1/metabolism', 'Substance P/*antagonists & inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/biosynthesis/drug effects', 'Virus Replication/drug effects']",,2001/03/29 10:00,2001/05/22 10:01,['2001/03/29 10:00'],"['2001/03/29 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/05/22 10:01 [medline]', '2001/03/29 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2001 Mar 27;98(7):3970-5. doi: 10.1073/pnas.071052298.,,,"['10.1073/pnas.071052298 [doi]', '98/7/3970 [pii]']",PMC31163,"['MH 49981/MH/NIMH NIH HHS/United States', 'DA12815/DA/NIDA NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 AI45008/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 AI045008/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 DA012815/DA/NIDA NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 MH049981/MH/NIMH NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,

In these tissues MRP2 specifically localizes to the apical membrane. The construction of MRP2 fused to the green fluorescent protein, and subsequent site-directed mutagenesis enabled the identification of a targeting signal in MRP2 that is responsible for its apical localization in polarized cells. The specific apical localization of MRP2 is due to a C-terminal tail that is not present in the basolaterally targeted MRP1. Deletion of three amino acids from the C-terminal of MRP2 (DeltaMRP2) causes the protein to be localized predominantly in the basolateral membrane in polarized Madin-Darby canine kidney cells. Interestingly, MRP2 expressed in a mouse leukemia cell line (L1210 cells) predominantly accumulates intracellularly with minimal cell membrane localization. In contrast, DeltaMRP2 was shown to predominantly localize in the cell membrane in L1210 cells. Increased transport of 2,4-dinitrophenyl glutathione from L1210 cells expressing DeltaMRP2 showed that the re-targeted protein retains its normal function.","['Harris, M J', 'Kuwano, M', 'Webb, M', 'Board, P G']","['Harris MJ', 'Kuwano M', 'Webb M', 'Board PG']","['Molecular Genetics Group, Division of Molecular Medicine, John Curtin School of Medical Research, Australian National University, Canberra ACT 0200, Australia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (ABCC2 protein, human)', '0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B)', '0 (Anion Transport Proteins)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Luminescent Proteins)', '0 (Membrane Transport Proteins)', '0 (Multidrug Resistance-Associated Protein 2)', '0 (Multidrug Resistance-Associated Proteins)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '147336-22-9 (Green Fluorescent Proteins)', '26289-39-4 (S-(2,4-dinitrophenyl)glutathione)', 'GAN16C9B8O (Glutathione)', 'Y49M64GZ4Q (multidrug resistance-associated protein 1)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Anion Transport Proteins', 'Carrier Proteins/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Membrane/metabolism', 'Cell Polarity', 'Dogs', '*Drug Resistance, Multiple', 'Genes, MDR', 'Glutathione/analogs & derivatives/pharmacokinetics', 'Green Fluorescent Proteins', 'Humans', 'Kidney', 'Kidney Tubules, Proximal/metabolism', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia L1210/pathology', 'Liver/metabolism', 'Luminescent Proteins/analysis/genetics', '*Membrane Transport Proteins', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Multidrug Resistance-Associated Protein 2', '*Multidrug Resistance-Associated Proteins', 'Mutagenesis, Site-Directed', 'Protein Conformation', 'Rats', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/chemistry/metabolism', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Sequence Deletion', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid', 'Signal Transduction', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,2001/03/29 10:00,2001/07/20 10:01,['2001/03/29 10:00'],"['2001/03/29 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/07/20 10:01 [medline]', '2001/03/29 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2001 Jun 15;276(24):20876-81. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M010566200.

Dominant negative versions of Vav1 and PKCtheta inhibited CD3/CD28-induced activation of JNK, revealing their relative importance for this activation pathway. Gel filtration experiments revealed the existence of constitutively associated Vav1/PKCtheta heterodimers in extracts from unstimulated T-cells, whereas T-cell costimulation induced the recruitment of Vav1 into high molecular weight complexes. Several experimental approaches showed that Vav1 is located upstream from PKCtheta in the control of the pathway leading to synergistic JNK activation. Vav1-derived signals lead to the activation of JNK by at least two different pathways. The major contribution of Vav1 for the activation of JNK relies on the PKCtheta-mediated Ca(2+)-independent synergistic activation pathway, whereas JNK is also activated by a separate Ca(2+)-dependent signaling route.","['Moller, A', 'Dienz, O', 'Hehner, S P', 'Droge, W', 'Schmitz, M L']","['Moller A', 'Dienz O', 'Hehner SP', 'Droge W', 'Schmitz ML']","['German Cancer Research Center, Division of Immunochemistry (G0200), Im Neuenheimer Feld 280, 69120 Heidelberg, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (Isoenzymes)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-vav)', '0 (Transcription Factor AP-1)', '0 (VAV1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (PRKCQ protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C-theta)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', '*Cell Cycle Proteins', 'DNA Primers', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Enzyme Induction', 'Gene Expression Regulation/physiology', 'Humans', 'Isoenzymes/*metabolism', 'JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/*biosynthesis', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Kinase C/*metabolism', 'Protein Kinase C-theta', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-vav', 'T-Lymphocytes/*enzymology', 'Transcription Factor AP-1/physiology']",,2001/03/29 10:00,2001/07/13 10:01,['2001/03/29 10:00'],"['2001/03/29 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/07/13 10:01 [medline]', '2001/03/29 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2001 Jun 8;276(23):20022-8. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M011139200.

Here we report a novel strategy to overcome the fusion and stability defects of modified retroviral envelope proteins. We inserted a prototypic ligand, the receptor binding domain of amphotropic murine leukemia virus, into an ecotropic murine leukemia virus envelope protein mutant containing glutamine 227-to-arginine plus aspartate 243-to-tyrosine substitutions. This modified protein increased transduction redirected to human cells expressing the amphotropic receptor to a level within 10-fold that of wild-type amphotropic virus, an increase of as great as 2000-fold over transduction by modified protein lacking the mutations. In addition to suppressing the fusion defect, these mutations unexpectedly stabilized the association of the modified protein with vector particles. Insertion of clinically relevant ligands into this envelope mutant should improve the efficiency and reliability of retroviral transduction of specific cell types for gene therapy applications.","['Zavorotinskaya, T', 'Albritton, L M']","['Zavorotinskaya T', 'Albritton LM']","['Department of Microbiology & Immunology, University of Tennessee Health Sciences Center, Memphis, Tennessee 38163, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Mol Ther,Molecular therapy : the journal of the American Society of Gene Therapy,100890581,"['0 (Ligands)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Retroviridae Proteins, Oncogenic)', '0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)']",IM,"['Cells, Cultured', '*Gene Transfer Techniques', 'Genetic Therapy', 'Genetic Vectors', 'Humans', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*genetics', 'Ligands', 'Models, Molecular', 'Mutagenesis, Insertional', '*Point Mutation', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/administration & dosage/genetics/metabolism', 'Retroviridae Proteins, Oncogenic/genetics', '*Transduction, Genetic', 'Viral Envelope Proteins/*genetics']",,2001/03/29 10:00,2001/08/03 10:01,['2001/03/29 10:00'],"['2001/03/29 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/08/03 10:01 [medline]', '2001/03/29 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Mol Ther. 2001 Mar;3(3):323-8. doi: 10.1006/mthe.2001.0262.,,,"['10.1006/mthe.2001.0262 [doi]', 'S1525-0016(01)90262-X [pii]']",,['AI33410/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,

Obstruction of inferior vena cava (IVC) is reportedly the most frequent cause of BCS in Afro-Asian variety. AIM: An attempt was made to classify BCS (in an eastern Indian population) etiopathologically. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Thirty consecutive cases of BCS presenting over a period of five years were included. Following a thorough physical examination, necessary investigations (including coagulation profile, ultrasonography (with Doppler study) of hepatobiliary tract, hepatic vein and IVC angiography (n = 22) and liver biopsy (n = 26, including autopsy in two cases) were performed. RESULTS: Mean age at presentation was 32.7 +/- 10.36 years (range 12-60 years) with M:F = 21:9. Clinical presentations included, hepatomegaly in 28 (93.3%), ascites in 27 (90%), splenomegaly in 15 (50%), pain in abdomen in 26 (86.6%), jaundice in 10 (33.3%), back veins in 20 (66.6%) and gastrointestinal bleeding in three (10%) cases. Amongst the total of 30 patients, four, six and 20 cases presented as fulminant, acute and chronic BCS respectively. Twenty four cases of BCS could be diagnosed by ultrasonography alone, while the remainder required angiography for diagnosis. IVC and hepatic vein angiography revealed membranous obstruction in nine, partial stricture of IVC in six, and IVC and/or hepatic vein block in others. The etiopathological nature in 30 cases were as follows: idiopathic membranous obstruction in nine (30%), hepatocellular carcinoma in six (20%), idiopathic stricture in six (20%) cases and one case (3.3%) each of the following: cholangiocarcinoma, renal cell carcinoma, chronic pancreatitis, hydatid cyst in liver, protein S deficiency, oral contraceptive use, nephrotic syndrome (with antithrombin III deficiency), polycythemia rubra vera and chronic lymphatic leukemia. CONCLUSION: Idiopathic membranous obstruction and stricture of IVC are the commonest cause of BCS in the eastern part of India. Hepatocellular carcinoma is also a common cause, presenting in the fulminant form. Ultrasonography may be a helpful screening test for BCS, but IVC and hepatic vein catheterisation is essential for a complete work up of these patients.","['De, B K', 'De, K K', 'Sen, S', 'Biswas, P K', 'Das, T K', 'Das, S', 'Hazra, B']","['De BK', 'De KK', 'Sen S', 'Biswas PK', 'Das TK', 'Das S', 'Hazra B']","['Department of Medicine and Cardiology, Institute of Post Graduate Medical Education and Research, 244, Acharya JC Bose Road, Calcutta 700 020.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],India,J Assoc Physicians India,The Journal of the Association of Physicians of India,7505585,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Budd-Chiari Syndrome/epidemiology/*etiology', 'Child', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', '*Developing Countries', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'India/epidemiology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged']",,2001/03/29 10:00,2001/04/06 10:01,['2001/03/29 10:00'],"['2001/03/29 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/04/06 10:01 [medline]', '2001/03/29 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Assoc Physicians India. 2000 Aug;48(8):800-3.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the clinical experience with high-dose chemotherapy and autologous bone marrow transplantation in lung cancer has been disappointing, with most trials showing little or no improvement in long-term survival. Unfortunately, lung cancer has a tendency to metastasize to the bone marrow, and lung cancer cells are known to circulate in the peripheral blood. Therefore, there is concern that autologous stem cell grafts from lung cancer patients may reinoculate recipients with live tumor cells. Photochemical purging of stem cell grafts with Merocyanine 540 (MC540) is highly effective against a wide range of leukemia and lymphoma cells and is well tolerated by normal hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells. Most solid tumor cells (including lung cancer cells), however, are only moderately sensitive or refractory to MC540-mediated photodynamic therapy (PDT). We report here that postirradiation hyperthermia (< or = 42 degrees C, 3 h) potentiates the MC540-mediated photoinactivation of both wild-type (H69) and cisplatin-resistant mutant (H69/CDDP) small cell lung cancer cells by several orders of magnitude, while only minimally enhancing the depletion of normal human granulocyte/macrophage progenitor cells. Our data suggest that postirradiation hyperthermia provides a simple and effective means of extending the utility of MC540-PDT to the purging of stem cell grafts contaminated with lung cancer and possibly other solid tumor cells.","['Tsujino, I', 'Anderson, G S', 'Sieber, F']","['Tsujino I', 'Anderson GS', 'Sieber F']","['Department of Pediatrics, Medical College of Wisconsin, 8701 Watertown Plank Road, Milwaukee, WI 53226, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Photochem Photobiol,Photochemistry and photobiology,0376425,"['0 (Photosensitizing Agents)', '0 (Pyrimidinones)', '58823-12-4 (merocyanine dye)']",IM,"['Bone Marrow Purging/*methods', 'Carcinoma, Small Cell/*therapy', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Hyperthermia, Induced', 'Lung Neoplasms/*therapy', 'Photosensitizing Agents/pharmacology', 'Pyrimidinones/pharmacology', 'Transplantation, Autologous', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,2001/03/29 10:00,2001/04/06 10:01,['2001/03/29 10:00'],"['2001/03/29 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/04/06 10:01 [medline]', '2001/03/29 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Photochem Photobiol. 2001 Feb;73(2):191-8. doi: 10.1562/0031-8655(2001)073<0191:phsptm>2.0.co;2.,,,['10.1562/0031-8655(2001)073<0191:phsptm>2.0.co;2 [doi]'],,['CA77387/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,

This risk, however, is significantly elevated in patients receiving human leukocyte antigen (HLA) mis-matched or T-cell-depleted grafts, or after treatment for severe graft-versus-host disease (GvHD). An 18-yr-old patient with positive Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) serology received a fully matched, unmanipulated bone marrow graft from an unrelated EBV-positive donor for treatment of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in second complete remission. GvHD prophylaxis was performed with cyclosporin A (CsA) and a short course of methotrexate. Four months after Tx, the patient developed ulcerative tonsillitis that was unresponsive to antibiotic treatment. Diarrhea appearing simultaneously was interpreted as gastrointestinal GvHD and steroids were added to CsA. A few days later the patient was admitted to hospital because of generalized seizure and pneumonia. Despite reduction of immunosuppression, intensification of anti-viral treatment, and subsequent mechanical ventilation, the patient died of acute respiratory distress 6 days later. Autopsy demonstrated disseminated EBV-induced, multi-nodular lymphoma infiltration of the entire colon but no signs of GvHD. Moreover, both lungs, paratracheal lymph nodes, kidneys, thyroid gland, and liver were infiltrated with large B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphomas. This case underlines the rapid and aggressive course of EBV-induced disseminated PTLD after HSCT, initially mimicking intestinal GvHD because of massive colonic lymphoma infiltration. Tissue biopsies should be performed early for establishing correct diagnosis, thus enabling specific therapy, e.g. infusion of donor leukocytes with cytotoxic T-lymphocytes.","['Claviez, A', 'Tiemann, M', 'Wagner, H J', 'Dreger, P', 'Suttorp, M']","['Claviez A', 'Tiemann M', 'Wagner HJ', 'Dreger P', 'Suttorp M']","['Department of Pediatrics, University of Kiel, Germany. a.claviez@pediatrics.uni-kiel.de']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",Denmark,Pediatr Transplant,Pediatric transplantation,9802574,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Epstein-Barr Virus Infections/*diagnosis', 'Fatal Outcome', 'Graft vs Host Disease/diagnosis/prevention & control', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*therapy', 'Lymphoproliferative Disorders/diagnosis/*virology', 'Male']",,2001/03/29 10:00,2001/04/06 10:01,['2001/03/29 10:00'],"['2001/03/29 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/04/06 10:01 [medline]', '2001/03/29 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Pediatr Transplant. 2000 May;4(2):151-5. doi: 10.1034/j.1399-3046.2000.00108.x.,,,['10.1034/j.1399-3046.2000.00108.x [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is of importance that anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA) in patients with Wegener's granulomatosis (WG) are mainly directed against PR3 only. Furthermore, PR3 is overexpressed in a variety of acute and chronic myeloid leukemia cells. Cytotoxic T lymphocytes specific for a PR3-derived peptide have been shown to specifically lyse leukemia cells that overexpress PR3. This review will focus on PR3 and the characteristics of PR3 that might implicate this particular antigen in the pathogenesis of WG and as target for immunotherapy in myeloid leukemias. We will discuss the genetic localization and gene regulation of PR3, the processing, storage, and expression of the PR3 protein, and the physiological functions of PR3, and compare this with the three other neutrophil-derived serine proteases: human leukocyte elastase, cathepsin G, and azurocidin. Three main differences are described between PR3 and the other serine proteases. This makes PR3 a very intriguing protein with a large array of physiological functions, some of which may play a role in ANCA-associated vasculitidis and myeloid leukemia.","['van der Geld, Y M', 'Limburg, P C', 'Kallenberg, C G']","['van der Geld YM', 'Limburg PC', 'Kallenberg CG']","['Department of Internal Medicine, University Hospital Groningen, The Netherlands.

Tumors were induced in NMRI-mice using a single intravaginal application of the carcinogen 7,12-dimethylbenz[a]anthracene (DMBA) (initiator) followed by intravaginal treatment with 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) (promotor) as a cocarcinogen over a period of 52 weeks. The substances were applied using small tampons. Development of preneoplastic lesions or neoplasias was not found in the group of untreated control animals (n = 50) and in TPA treated animals (n = 50). However, mice which had been treated with TPA alone showed pronounced hyperplasia. When DMBA was applied without subsequent treatment with TPA (n = 100), formation of preneoplastic lesions was frequently observed. Fibroepitheliomas (papillomas), carcinomas and sarcomas, typically located intravaginally and at the external region of the vagina, were observed after the combined treatment with DMBA and TPA (n = 100). In addition, benign as well as malignant tumors were found, mainly in the forestomach, in DMBA treated animals and more frequently after application of DMBA and TPA. Tumors of the lung and leukemias were identified more frequently in comparison to the normal spontaneous tumor rate in NMRI mice, and were probably in part caused by the promoting substance TPA. On the other hand, no significant tumor formation in the mammary gland and in the ovaries was observed after DMBA/TPA application. The tumors observed in these organs were, however, caused by treatment with the carcinogen DMBA only. This new modification of the 2-stage experiment, i.e. the direct intravaginal application of initiating and promoting substances, has special relevance for the elucidation of the mechanisms involved in the development of carcinomas located at the portio vaginalis uteri in humans.","['Goerttler, K', 'Lohrke, H', 'Hesse, B']","['Goerttler K', 'Lohrke H', 'Hesse B']","['Institute of Experimental Pathology, German Cancer Research Center, Heidelberg, GFR.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",England,Carcinogenesis,Carcinogenesis,8008055,"['0 (Carcinogens)', '57-97-6 (9,10-Dimethyl-1,2-benzanthracene)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['9,10-Dimethyl-1,2-benzanthracene/administration & dosage/*toxicity', 'Adenocarcinoma/chemically induced/pathology', 'Adenoma/chemically induced/pathology', 'Administration, Intravaginal', 'Animals', 'Carcinogens/administration & dosage/*toxicity', 'Carcinoma/chemically induced/pathology', '*Cocarcinogenesis', 'Drug Synergism', 'Female', 'Hyperplasia', 'Leukemia, Experimental/chemically induced/pathology', 'Lung Neoplasms/chemically induced/pathology', 'Mammary Neoplasms, Experimental/chemically induced/pathology', 'Mice', 'Models, Animal', 'Neoplasms, Experimental/*chemically induced/pathology', 'Organ Specificity', 'Ovarian Neoplasms/chemically induced/pathology', 'Papilloma/chemically induced/pathology', 'Precancerous Conditions/chemically induced/pathology', 'Sarcoma, Experimental/chemically induced/pathology', 'Specific Pathogen-Free Organisms', 'Stomach Neoplasms/chemically induced/pathology', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/administration & dosage/*toxicity', 'Vagina/drug effects/pathology', 'Vaginal Neoplasms/*chemically induced/pathology']",,1980/08/01 00:00,2001/04/03 10:01,['1980/08/01 00:00'],"['1980/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2001/04/03 10:01 [medline]', '1980/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Carcinogenesis. 1980 Aug;1(8):707-13. doi: 10.1093/carcin/1.8.707.,,,['10.1093/carcin/1.8.707 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It has been suggested that there may be a relation between topoisomerase expression and response to topoisomerase poisons, based mainly on results from in vitro studies. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate this relation in a clinical setting and determine whether topoisomerase II alpha and II beta might be of predictive value in ALL. METHODS: Cellular expression of topoisomerases II alpha and II beta was assessed in 177 cases of ALL by immunohistochemistry using monoclonal antibodies to the two enzymes. The percentages of cell nuclei showing positive staining for topoisomerase II alpha and II beta expression were assessed. RESULTS: Taking the series as a whole, a clear separation of survival curves was seen with the established prognostic markers white blood cell (WBC) count, CD10 status, and sex. However, topoisomerase II alpha and II beta expression showed no relation to survival. No association was found between the topoisomerases and the prognostic markers CD10 and WBC count; however, topoisomerase II alpha expression was found to be related to sex, with expression being lower in girls (p = 0.002). CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that the response to topoisomerase poisons cannot be predicted by the assessment of topoisomerase II alpha and II beta expression as defined by immunohistochemistry.","['Lodge, A J', 'Hall, A G', 'Reid, M M', 'McIntosh, G G', 'Steward, M', 'Anderson, J J', 'Horne, C H', 'Angus, B']","['Lodge AJ', 'Hall AG', 'Reid MM', 'McIntosh GG', 'Steward M', 'Anderson JJ', 'Horne CH', 'Angus B']","['Department of Pathology, University of Newcastle, Queen Victoria Road, Newcastle upon Tyne, NE2 4HH, UK. ajlodge@yahoo.co.uk']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial']",England,J Clin Pathol,Journal of clinical pathology,0376601,"['0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Isoenzymes)', '0 (Topoisomerase II Inhibitors)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', 'EC 5.99.1.3 (DNA Topoisomerases, Type II)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antigens, Neoplasm', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*metabolism', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', '*DNA Topoisomerases, Type II/*metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins', 'Daunorubicin/administration & dosage', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/administration & dosage', 'Etoposide/administration & dosage', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Immunoenzyme Techniques', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Isoenzymes/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/*enzymology', 'Prognosis', 'Survival Rate', 'Topoisomerase II Inhibitors', 'Treatment Outcome']",,2001/03/29 10:00,2001/04/03 10:01,['2001/03/29 10:00'],"['2001/03/29 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/04/03 10:01 [medline]', '2001/03/29 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Clin Pathol. 2001 Jan;54(1):31-6. doi: 10.1136/jcp.54.1.31.,,,['10.1136/jcp.54.1.31 [doi]'],PMC1731267,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Cell classification, reflecting protein patterns, clearly distinguished two main groups: one group consists of 9, 12 and 24 h treated BOH cells while the second is represented by the 0 and 24 h control untreated cells and the 6 h BOH-exposed CEM lymphoblasts. Discriminant protein spots differentially expressed in the BOH-treated CEM cells were selected for identification by matrix assisted laser desorption/ionization-mass spectrometry (MALDI-MS) or electrospray ionization-tandem MS (ESI-MS/MS). Five of the selected protein spots were unequivocally identified as alpha-enolase, triosephosphate isomerase, eukaryotic initiation factor 5A, and alpha- and beta-subunits of Rho GDP-dissociation inhibitor 1. These proteins, all significantly downregulated in CEM T-lymphoblast leukemia in the course of BOH treatment, are known to play an important role in cellular functions such as glycolysis, protein biosynthesis, and cytoskeleton rearrangement. These results indicate that the cellular effects of olomoucine-derived CDKIs are not dependent on their ability to inhibit CDKs and could be mediated by several factors such as a decrease in protein synthesis and/or glycolysis which in turn diminishes the ability of cancer cells to function.","['Kovarova, H', 'Hajduch, M', 'Korinkova, G', 'Halada, P', 'Krupickova, S', 'Gouldsworthy, A', 'Zhelev, N', 'Strnad, M']","['Kovarova H', 'Hajduch M', 'Korinkova G', 'Halada P', 'Krupickova S', 'Gouldsworthy A', 'Zhelev N', 'Strnad M']","['Institute of Radiobiology and Immunology, Purkyne Medical Academy, Hradec Kralove, Czech Republic. kovarova@pmfhk.cz']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Electrophoresis,Electrophoresis,8204476,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proteome)', '0 (Purines)', '0 (bohemine)', '6A839B2HYS (olomoucine)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinases)', 'P39Y9652YJ (Kinetin)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/chemical synthesis/*pharmacology', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Electrophoresis, Gel, Two-Dimensional/methods', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/chemical synthesis/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Kinetin', 'Neoplasm Proteins/analysis/*classification', 'Proteome', '*Purines/chemical synthesis/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,2001/03/29 10:00,2001/06/15 10:01,['2001/03/29 10:00'],"['2001/03/29 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/06/15 10:01 [medline]', '2001/03/29 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Electrophoresis. 2000 Nov;21(17):3757-64. doi: 10.1002/1522-2683(200011)21:17<3757::AID-ELPS3757>3.0.CO;2-X.,,,"['10.1002/1522-2683(200011)21:17<3757::AID-ELPS3757>3.0.CO;2-X [pii]', '10.1002/1522-2683(200011)21:17<3757::AID-ELPS3757>3.0.CO;2-X [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In protocols C and D, CC-5 at a dose of 400 mg/kg b.w. produced significant tumor inhibition rate (TIR) values of 60% (P < 0.001) and 70% (P < 0.001) respectively. Alpha-hederin, a triterpene saponin isolated from CC-5, when given i.p. for 7 days at doses of 5 and 10 mg/kg b.w. to mice with formed tumors, produced significant dose-dependent TIR values of 48% (P < 0.05) and 65% (p < 0.01) respectively on day 8 and 50% (P < 0.01) and 71% (P < 0.001), respectively, on day 15, compared to 81% (P < 0.01) on day 8 and 42% (P < 0.01) on day 15 in the cyclophosphamide (CP)-treated group.

The cytokine tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) also stimulates NK cells directly through receptor-ligand mechanisms. We have combined in the present study the NK-enhancing properties of IFN (Poly I:C-induced) and TNF-alpha by giving Poly I:C to leukemic mice for 8 days after irradiation and SBMT, concomitant with TNF-alpha during the first 4 days immediately after SBMT. All mice were sampled at day 9 following irradiation, transplant, and treatment. METHODS: NK cells were identified and quantified by immunoperosidase labeling methods combined with a hematologic staining technique. RESULTS: The data reveal that TNF-alpha, added to the Poly I:C administration protocol, significantly boosted NK cell numbers 2.4-fold over that achieved by Poly I:C alone. CONCLUSIONS: Since the role of NK cells in the immediate post-transplant period is (a) to destroy residual tumor cells, and (b) to produce hemopoiesis-driving cytokines, it appears that two NK cell stimulants are better than one, at least in the crucial, early post-transplant period.","['Currier, N L', 'Miller, S C']","['Currier NL', 'Miller SC']","['Department of Anatomy & Cell Biology, McGill University, Montreal, QC, Canada.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Germany,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol,Cancer chemotherapy and pharmacology,7806519,"['0 (Interferon Inducers)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', 'O84C90HH2L (Poly I-C)']",IM,"['Animals', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Interferon Inducers/*pharmacology', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*drug effects/immunology', 'Leukemia, Experimental/immunology/*therapy', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred DBA', 'Poly I-C/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/administration & dosage/*pharmacology']",,2001/03/28 10:00,2001/04/06 10:01,['2001/03/28 10:00'],"['2001/03/28 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/04/06 10:01 [medline]', '2001/03/28 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol. 2001;47(2):185-6. doi: 10.1007/s002800000222.,,,['10.1007/s002800000222 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The purpose is to investigate which subunit for activating MAPK p42/44 in leukemia cell while the cytoplasmic region homodimerization (190cyt-190cyt, 130cyt-130cyt) was induced by LIF. The results showed that MAPK p42/44 expression level after LIF stimulation 5 h was lower in the transformants with pED 130/190 (190cyt- 190cyt) (p < 0.01) and higher in the transformants with pED 190/130 (130cyt- 130cyt) (p < 0.05) than those in the parent cells. Meanwhile, MAPK p42/44 phosphorylation (Thr202/Tyr204) was ascended and the highest at 10 min in the 190/130 and descended in the 130/190. It suggests that gp130 activate MAPK p42/44 and gp190 indirectly regulate its expression and function. In order to analyses the relation of the subunit oligomerization and MAPK p42/44 we also prepared the recombination of the extracellular and transmembrane region of Fas and the cytoplasmic region of each LIFR subunit (Fas/190, Fas/130). After transduction into HL-60 with lipofection and induction by anti-Fas IgG, we found that MAPK p42/44 expression levels were lower in the Fas/190 than in the Fas/130 and parent cells (p < 0.01) and no difference between the Fas/130 and the wild type receptor. However, phospho-MAPK p42/44 were increased in the Fas/130 than the parent cells. It suggests that the oligomerization of the cytoplasmic regions of gp130 be potential to normally initiate MAPK p42/44 for the signal of HL-60 proliferation. We also determine that the separated oligomerization FasDD (no dimerization) can initiate the corresponding signal molecules, then regulate MAPK p42/44 expression and phosphorylation in leukemia cells.","['Liu, H', 'Dan, J', 'Tang, S', 'Wu, S']","['Liu H', 'Dan J', 'Tang S', 'Wu S']","['Department of Histology and Embryology, Second Military Medical University, Shanghai, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Mol Cell Biochem,Molecular and cellular biochemistry,0364456,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (IL6ST protein, human)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (LIFR protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor Receptor alpha Subunit)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Protein Subunits)', '0 (Receptors, Cytokine)', '0 (Receptors, OSM-LIF)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (fas Receptor)', '133483-10-0 (Cytokine Receptor gp130)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 3)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Cell Division', 'Cytokine Receptor gp130', 'Cytoplasm/chemistry', 'Dimerization', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Growth Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', '*Interleukin-6', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor Receptor alpha Subunit', 'Lymphokines/*pharmacology', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1/*metabolism', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 3', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/*metabolism', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Protein Subunits', 'Receptors, Cytokine/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Receptors, OSM-LIF', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/metabolism', 'Transfection', 'fas Receptor/chemistry/genetics/immunology/*physiology']",,2001/03/28 10:00,2001/08/03 10:01,['2001/03/28 10:00'],"['2001/03/28 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/08/03 10:01 [medline]', '2001/03/28 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Mol Cell Biochem. 2001 Jan;217(1-2):113-20. doi: 10.1023/a:1007220627845.,,,['10.1023/a:1007220627845 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Consequently, fundamental understanding of the oncogenic process is likely to be beneficially addressed by genetic methodology. Current methods have largely focused on single-gene defects, like chimeric genes, which are present in many sarcomas and leukemias. Real understanding is more likely to derive from a genome-wide analysis of these malignancies. Recent technologic advances have made it possible to simultaneously assess the entire expressed gene profile, or transcriptome, of a given cancer. Foremost among these methods is gene expression profiling using DNA microarrays. Two basic approaches predominate: spotted arrays and photolithography arrays. Regardless of the method, the resulting information can be used to create disease profiles, but only if appropriate bioinformatic solutions are employed. Common analytic approaches include two-way expression comparisons, or scatter analyses; outlier gene analysis, to identify significantly dysregulated genes; dendrogram analyses, as pioneered by Eisen; cluster analyses to identify diagnostic or biologic groups; and various forms of functional analyses to identify relevant genes and biologic pathways. Studies of both adult and pediatric cancer have demonstrated the feasibility of such analyses to identify both diagnostic and prognostic groups of tumors. Acute childhood leukemias have been grouped into myelogenous and lymphoid, and even B- and T-cell subsets. Breast cancer prognostic groups have been identified on the basis of a small subset of expressed genes. In addition, preliminary data on childhood sarcomas appear to identify both diagnostic and prognostic subsets. Specifically, embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma could be distinguished from alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma, and even morphologically mixed embryonal and alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma showed similar gene expression profiles in both histologies. Further, collaborative studies using clustering analyses appear to identify prognostic groups of diverse sarcomas. Larger institutional and cooperative group studies are currently underway to validate these preliminary findings.","['Triche, T J', 'Schofield, D', 'Buckley, J']","['Triche TJ', 'Schofield D', 'Buckley J']","[""Department of Pathology, Children's Hospital Los Angeles, California 90027, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Cancer J,"Cancer journal (Sudbury, Mass.)",100931981,,IM,"['Animals', 'Bone Neoplasms/diagnosis/genetics', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Computational Biology', 'Gene Expression Profiling/*methods', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*diagnosis/genetics', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis/*methods', 'Osteosarcoma/diagnosis/genetics', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/diagnosis/genetics', 'Prognosis', 'Rhabdomyosarcoma, Alveolar/diagnosis/genetics', 'Rhabdomyosarcoma, Embryonal/diagnosis/genetics', 'Sarcoma/*diagnosis/genetics', 'Statistics as Topic']",68,2001/03/28 10:00,2001/05/26 10:01,['2001/03/28 10:00'],"['2001/03/28 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/05/26 10:01 [medline]', '2001/03/28 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer J. 2001 Jan-Feb;7(1):2-15.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The present work explored its effects in long-term culture of bone marrow cells, harvested from a patient with acute lymphoid leukemia (ALL-L3) in the second complete remission. Nine cultivation flasks were established and maintained for five weeks, with medium renewal once a week. At each re-feeding, methionine-enkephalin was added to the cultures in final concentrations 10(-8), 10(-10) or 10(-12) M, and granulocyte-macrophage progenitor cells (GM-CFU) were determined among the harvested, nonadherent cell populations. The total number of nonadherent cells was 8% to 42% higher in the treated cultures than in the control, nontreated cultures, and the GM-CFU counts were three to four times higher. Those changes, although evident, did not reach statistical significance because of the small group sizes. In 1 of 9 cultures the adherent cell layer was atypical, the cell population consisted of small cells resembling the lymphoblasts, and the cell count was 2-8 times higher than in the controls. That aberrant culture has presumably arisen from residual leukemic cells remaining in the bone marrow after chemotherapy. The findings support the idea that opioid peptides, including methionine-enkephalin, participate in regulation of hematopoiesis. Two mechanisms may have accounted for the observed effects of enkephalin on cultured bone marrow cells: an indirect action, via interleukins secreted from the stromal cells upon stimulation of the opioid receptors, or a direct action on hematopoietic precursors.","['Janda, S S', 'Boranic, M', 'Skodlar, J', 'Petrovecki, M', 'Nemet, D', 'Labar, B']","['Janda SS', 'Boranic M', 'Skodlar J', 'Petrovecki M', 'Nemet D', 'Labar B']","['Department of Molecular Medicine, Ruder Boskovic Institute, POB 180, Bijenicka 54 10002 Zagreb, Croatia. boranic@rudjer.irb.hr']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Croatia,Acta Med Croatica,Acta medica Croatica : casopis Hravatske akademije medicinskih znanosti,9208249,"['58569-55-4 (Enkephalin, Methionine)']",IM,"['Bone Marrow Cells/cytology/*drug effects', 'Cell Adhesion/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'Enkephalin, Methionine/*pharmacology/physiology', 'Hematopoiesis/physiology', 'Humans']",,2001/03/28 10:00,2001/05/22 10:01,['2001/03/28 10:00'],"['2001/03/28 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/05/22 10:01 [medline]', '2001/03/28 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Acta Med Croatica. 2000;54(3):99-105.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Psychosocial care for families with a chronically ill child should improve open communication and social orientation in an early stage of the disease and should try to change maladaptive cognitive reactions.","['Goldbeck, L', 'Braun, J', 'Storck, M', 'Tonnessen, D', 'Weyhreter, H', 'Debatin, K M']","['Goldbeck L', 'Braun J', 'Storck M', 'Tonnessen D', 'Weyhreter H', 'Debatin KM']",['Universitats-Kinderklinik Ulm. lutz.goldbeck@medizin.uni-ulm.de'],['ger'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Germany,Psychother Psychosom Med Psychol,"Psychotherapie, Psychosomatik, medizinische Psychologie",8002823,,IM,"['*Adaptation, Psychological', 'Adult', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', '*Chronic Disease', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Parents/*psychology', 'Quality of Life', 'Stress, Psychological/*psychology', 'Surveys and Questionnaires', 'Time Factors']",,2001/03/28 10:00,2001/05/18 10:01,['2001/03/28 10:00'],"['2001/03/28 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/05/18 10:01 [medline]', '2001/03/28 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Psychother Psychosom Med Psychol. 2001 Feb;51(2):62-7. doi: 10.1055/s-2001-10753.,Adaptation von Eltern an eine chronische Erkrankung ihres Kindes nach der Diagnosestellung.,,['10.1055/s-2001-10753 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

While uniform chemotherapy adopted in multicenter studies provided a constant improvement in cure rates for standard risk patients, the results reached in very high risk patients have been disappointing. The objective of this review is to point out the role of allogenic bone marrow transplantation (alloBMT) in very high risk childhood ALL on the basis of results from the current clinical trials. EVIDENCE AND INFORMATION SOURCE: Data covered by Medline and produced by the authors involved in ongoing international studies cover a vast ""scenario"" of children with very high risk ALL who underwent allogeneic BMT. STATE OF ART: The author outlines the crucial point of very high risk factors in childhood ALL in order to identify those children who are at risk of early relapse. The main reasons for pursuing alloBMT in this particular category of patients concern poor prognostic factors such as molecular biology markers, structural chromosomal abnormalities and biological factors (poor prednisone response) including resistance to initial induction chemotherapy. AlloBMT in childhood ALL in first complete remission seemed to lead to a promising disease-free survival in this patient population when compared with chemotherapy. The principal biases of the retrospective studies were the variable very high risk eligibility criteria, the different first-line therapies adopted before alloBMT and above all the waiting time to transplant which could have accounted for some advantage to alloBMT patients versus chemotherapy patients. PERSPECTIVES: The author touches upon the preliminary results of an ongoing international prospective study as an example of reaching a consensus in the controversial treatment of childhood very high risk ALL. This attempt should provide more information regarding the role of alloBMT in this setting and should cover an area of particular interest.","['Uderzo, C']",['Uderzo C'],"['BMT Unit, Pediatric Hematologic Department, S.

Conventional intensive chemotherapy (CHEMO) can cure up to 30% of children who have relapsed after ALL: similar results have been obtained with autologous bone marrow transplantation (ABMT), but allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (AlloBMT) seems to be the best therapeutic option. In this review the authors point out the contribution of current strategy in the setting of children with ALL who experience a first relapse and should be offered optimal treatment in order to obtain the best disease-free survival (DFS). The principal objective of this issue is to reach a possible consensus on the more controversial points regarding factors considered strong predictors of the outcome of the relapsed patients, second-line chemotherapy, optimal timing and type of transplantation. EVIDENCE AND INFORMATION SOURCE: Data published in the literature over the last decade concerning early and late relapse in childhood ALL suggest that improvements in cure rates may be achieved by intensification of the relapse treatment both with chemotherapy and with different types of transplantation. An accurate search for Medline data has been performed in order to understand the risk-benefit ratio of aggressive therapy adopted in this setting. STATE OF ART: Modern first-line treatment protocols for childhood ALL have contributed to curing an ever larger number of patients but this strategy could be responsible for creating a more resistant leukemic clone at the time of systemic or extramedullary relapse. This hypothesis emerges from a number of single or multicenter experiences; thus clinical and biological features in relapsed patients are being studied carefully in order to understand which risk-directed second-line therapy should be best adopted. The BFM group classified ALL relapses as ""very early"", ""early"", or ""late"" according to the time from diagnosis to first relapse (i.e. < 18, > 18 and < 30 or more than 30 months) and has shown that about 2/3 of the small fraction of children with late extramedullary relapses or late non T-marrow relapses or early combined non T-relapses can be rescued by chemotherapy; in contrast ALL early relapses or T-immunophenotype ALL relapses can be rescue only by AlloBMT. Since 1990 the AIEOP group adopted BFM-like first-line treatment and experienced similar situations for relapsed patients so that, even in absence of a real common relapse protocol, they went in the same direction as the BFM group as far as hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) procedures and decision were concerned. A recent AIEOP study on the destiny of 192 consecutive patients with ALL in 2nd complete remission and not having an HLA suitable sibling donor is presented in this issue. The value of different HSCT procedures is addressed and the protection against a new relapse seems to be real, although, of course, the risk-benefit ratio should always be evaluated. PERSPECTIVES: Very few prospective studies on the treatment of childhood ALL relapse have been set up in the last decade because of many difficulties regarding common second-line therapies, some reluctance versus HSCT in consideration of the transplant-related mortality and the so-called late effects. Additional modifications of allogeneic family and unrelated donor HSCT strategies and the promising results both of cord HSCT and auto-grafting methods including in vitro purging or post-transplant immunotherapy, are making transplantation procedures for ALL relapsed patients more appropriate and increasing confidence in their use. The possibility of performing common prospective international studies should be encouraged over the next years in order to elucidate an area of great research as is that of the treatment of childhood ALL relapse.","['Uderzo, C', 'Dini, G', 'Locatelli, F', 'Miniero, R', 'Tamaro, P']","['Uderzo C', 'Dini G', 'Locatelli F', 'Miniero R', 'Tamaro P']","['Centro TMO, Clinica Pediatrica, Ospedale S.

A population-based case-control study was used, covering the whole of the former West Germany. Residential magnetic fields were measured over 24 hr for 514 children with acute leukaemia identified by the German Childhood Cancer Registry and 1,301 control children taken from population registration files. Magnetic fields above 0.2 microT were relatively rare in Germany (only 1.5% of the study population). Childhood leukaemia and 24 hr median magnetic fields were only weakly related (OR = 1.55, 95% CI 0.65-3.67). A significant association was seen between childhood leukaemia and magnetic field exposure during the night (OR = 3.21, 95% CI 1.33-7.80). A dose-response-relationship was observed after combining the data of all German studies on magnetic fields and childhood leukaemia. The evidence for an association between childhood leukaemia and magnetic field exposure in our study comes from a measure of exposure during the night. Despite the large size of our study, the results are based on small numbers of exposed children. If the observed association stands, the effect on a population level in Germany would be small.","['Schuz, J', 'Grigat, J P', 'Brinkmann, K', 'Michaelis, J']","['Schuz J', 'Grigat JP', 'Brinkmann K', 'Michaelis J']","['Institute for Medical Statistics and Documentation, University of Mainz, Mainz, Germany. schuez@imsd.uni-mainz.de']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Radiation', 'Electromagnetic Fields/*adverse effects', 'Female', 'Germany', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Leukemia/*epidemiology/*etiology', 'Leukemia, Radiation-Induced/epidemiology/etiology', 'Male', 'Odds Ratio', 'Risk Factors', 'Time Factors']",,2001/03/27 10:00,2001/04/21 10:01,['2001/03/27 10:00'],"['2001/03/27 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/04/21 10:01 [medline]', '2001/03/27 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Int J Cancer. 2001 Mar 1;91(5):728-35. doi: 10.1002/1097-0215(200002)9999:9999<::aid-ijc1097>3.0.co;2-d.,,"['Copyright 2001 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']","['10.1002/1097-0215(200002)9999:9999<::AID-IJC1097>3.0.CO;2-D [pii]', '10.1002/1097-0215(200002)9999:9999<::aid-ijc1097>3.0.co;2-d [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the functional role of overexpressed PDPK F(A) in cancer remains to be established. In this report, we explore the potential role of PDPK F(A) in leukemia cell growth by investigating the effects of partial inhibition of this kinase on human acute promyelocytic leukemia (HL-60) and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (Jurkat) cells. Cloning of PDPK F(A) cDNA and its recombinant antisense expression vector and antibody were successfully developed. Several stable antisense clones of HL-60 and Jurkat cells were subcloned, which expressed a low level of PDPK F(A) when compared with the control-transfected clone in immunoblot analysis. Moreover, these antisense clones potently inhibited cell growth, clonogenic growth in soft agar and serum-independent growth. The results taken together demonstrate that suppression of PDPK F(A) is able to interfere with the growth of HL-60 and Jurkat cells, suggesting an essential role of this PDPK in human acute leukemia cell growth.","['Hsu, C P', 'Yang, C C', 'Yang, S D']","['Hsu CP', 'Yang CC', 'Yang SD']","['Department of Life Science, National Tsing Hua University, Hsinchu, Taiwan, R.O.C.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,"['0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (Oligonucleotides, Antisense)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.11.- (Proline-Directed Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)']",IM,"['Cell Division', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'DNA, Complementary/metabolism', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Immunoblotting', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*drug therapy/*enzymology', 'Oligonucleotides, Antisense/metabolism', 'Proline-Directed Protein Kinases', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/*metabolism', 'Recombinant Proteins/metabolism', 'Time Factors', 'Transfection']",,2001/03/27 10:00,2001/04/21 10:01,['2001/03/27 10:00'],"['2001/03/27 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/04/21 10:01 [medline]', '2001/03/27 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Int J Cancer. 2001 Mar 1;91(5):650-53. doi: 10.1002/1097-0215(200002)9999:9999<::aid-ijc1100>3.0.co;2-3.,,"['Copyright 2001 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']","['10.1002/1097-0215(200002)9999:9999<::AID-IJC1100>3.0.CO;2-3 [pii]', '10.1002/1097-0215(200002)9999:9999<::aid-ijc1100>3.0.co;2-3 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, a small study suggested that acute monocytic leukemia (AML-M5) is sensitive to MTX. We measured MTX accumulation/polyglutamylation in 20 AML-nonM5, 37 AML-M5 and 83 common/preB-acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (c/preB-ALL) samples. Membrane transport was determined in 11 childhood AMLs (including 3 AML-M5) and in 25 c/preB-ALL samples. MTX sensitivity was determined in 23 AML-nonM5, 15 AML-M5 and 63 common/preB-ALL samples using the thymidylate synthase (TS) inhibition assay. MTX transport was higher in AML samples compared with c/preB-ALL precluding a transport defect in AML. Accumulation of long-chain polyglutamates MTX-Glu(4-6) was 3-fold lower for AML-nonM5 compared with c/preB-ALL cells (median 268 versus 889 pmol MTX-Glu(4-6)/10(9) cells; P < or = 0.001); for AML-M5 samples, median accumulation of MTX-Glu(4-6) was 0 pmol/10(9) cells (P < or = 0.001). After short-term MTX exposure, AML-nonM5 was 6-fold more resistant to MTX compared with c/preB-ALL cells (2.16 versus 0.39 microM; P < 0.001), while AML-M5 was 2-fold more resistant (P = 0.02). In both AML-nonM5 and AML-M5 cells, MTX resistance was circumvented by continuous MTX exposure (median TSI(50) values: 0.052 and 0.041 microM, respectively) compared with a c/preB-ALL value of 0.066 microM. In conclusion, AML-M5 is relatively sensitive to MTX compared with other AML-subtypes even though polyglutamylation of MTX is poor. Using continuous exposure, AML-nonM5 and AML-M5 cells were at least as sensitive to MTX as c/preB-ALL cells. This report suggests that MTX might be an overlooked drug in the treatment of childhood AML.","['Rots, M G', 'Pieters, R', 'Jansen, G', 'Kaspers, G J', 'Van Zantwijk, C H', 'Noordhuis, P', 'Voorn, D A', 'Van Wering, E R', 'Creutzig, U', 'Veerman, A J', 'Peters, G J']","['Rots MG', 'Pieters R', 'Jansen G', 'Kaspers GJ', 'Van Zantwijk CH', 'Noordhuis P', 'Voorn DA', 'Van Wering ER', 'Creutzig U', 'Veerman AJ', 'Peters GJ']","['Department of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, University Hospital Vrije Universiteit, 1007 MB, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Eur J Cancer,"European journal of cancer (Oxford, England : 1990)",9005373,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', 'EC 2.1.1.45 (Thymidylate Synthase)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use', 'Biological Transport', 'Child', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Monocytic, Acute/*drug therapy/enzymology', 'Methotrexate/pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use', 'Thymidylate Synthase/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,2001/03/27 10:00,2001/04/17 10:01,['2001/03/27 10:00'],"['2001/03/27 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/04/17 10:01 [medline]', '2001/03/27 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Eur J Cancer. 2001 Mar;37(4):492-8. doi: 10.1016/s0959-8049(00)00433-0.,,,"['S0959804900004330 [pii]', '10.1016/s0959-8049(00)00433-0 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have shown that H. pylori-mediated iNOS induction in J774A.1 is independent of established virulence factors but dependent on direct interaction between bacteria and cells. In J774A.1, iNOS was equally upregulated by the wild-type strains J99, 26695, P12, and P1 as well as by mutants lacking the cag pathogenicity island, vacA, katA, alpAB genes and the hp0043 gene taking part in lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis when direct cell contact was allowed but not when bacteria and cells were separated by protein-permeable filter membranes. In contrast, iNOS was not induced in THP-1. This indicates that H. pylori-mediated iNOS induction in J774A.1 is independent of important virulence factors whereas cell contact is crucial which suggests a role of adhesion or phagocytosis.","['Assmann, I A', 'Enders, G A', 'Puls, J', 'Rieder, G', 'Haas, R', 'Hatz, R A']","['Assmann IA', 'Enders GA', 'Puls J', 'Rieder G', 'Haas R', 'Hatz RA']","['Department of Surgery, Klinikum Grosshadern, Ludwig-Maximilians-University Munich, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,FEMS Immunol Med Microbiol,FEMS immunology and medical microbiology,9315554,"['0 (Bacterial Proteins)', '0 (Lipoproteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Virulence Factors)', 'EC 1.14.13.39 (NOS2 protein, human)', 'EC 1.14.13.39 (Nitric Oxide Synthase)', 'EC 1.14.13.39 (Nitric Oxide Synthase Type II)', 'EC 1.14.13.39 (Nos2 protein, mouse)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Bacterial Adhesion/physiology', 'Bacterial Proteins/*pharmacology', 'Enzyme Induction', 'Helicobacter pylori/*pathogenicity', 'Humans', 'Lipoproteins/*pharmacology', 'Macrophages/drug effects/*enzymology/microbiology', 'Mice', 'Nitric Oxide Synthase/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Nitric Oxide Synthase Type II', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', '*Virulence Factors']",,2001/03/27 10:00,2001/05/26 10:01,['2001/03/27 10:00'],"['2001/03/27 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/05/26 10:01 [medline]', '2001/03/27 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,FEMS Immunol Med Microbiol. 2001 Mar;30(2):133-8. doi: 10.1111/j.1574-695X.2001.tb01561.x.,,,"['S0928-8244(00)00247-9 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1574-695X.2001.tb01561.x [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have investigated the PBX1 genomic sequence to identify polymorphisms that may contribute to diabetes susceptibility in the Pimas. PBX1 is composed of nine exons spanning approx. 117 kb and is located within 300 kb of microsatellite D1S1677, which marks the peak of linkage to diabetes susceptibility in the Pima Indians. We detected 16 single nucleotide polymorphisms in PBX1 including one causing a glycine to serine substitution at residue 21. Comparison of the frequencies of the polymorphisms between affected and unaffected Pima Indians did not detect any significant differences, indicating that mutations in PBX1 do not explain the linkage of 1q with type 2 diabetes in this population. The genomic structure of PBX1 provides a basis for similar systematic examinations of this candidate locus in other populations in relation to both type 2 diabetes and other metabolic disorders.","['Thameem, F', 'Wolford, J K', 'Bogardus, C', 'Prochazka, M']","['Thameem F', 'Wolford JK', 'Bogardus C', 'Prochazka M']","['Clinical Diabetes and Nutrition Section, Phoenix Epidemiology and Clinical Research Branch, National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, National Institutes of Health, 4212, North 16th Street, 85016, Phoenix, AZ, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Netherlands,Biochim Biophys Acta,Biochimica et biophysica acta,0217513,"[""0 (3' Untranslated Regions)"", '0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (MAS1 protein, human)', '0 (Pre-B-Cell Leukemia Transcription Factor 1)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Mas)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (pbx1 protein, human)']",IM,"[""3' Untranslated Regions"", 'Base Sequence', 'DNA, Complementary', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics', 'Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2/*genetics', 'Exons', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease/genetics', 'Genetic Variation', 'Humans', 'Indians, North American/*genetics', 'Introns', 'Molecular Sequence Data', '*Polymorphism, Genetic', 'Pre-B-Cell Leukemia Transcription Factor 1', 'Proto-Oncogene Mas', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*genetics', 'Tissue Distribution', 'United States']",,2001/03/27 10:00,2001/06/29 10:01,['2001/03/27 10:00'],"['2001/03/27 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/06/29 10:01 [medline]', '2001/03/27 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Biochim Biophys Acta. 2001 Mar 19;1518(1-2):215-20. doi: 10.1016/s0167-4781(01)00189-0.,,,"['S0167-4781(01)00189-0 [pii]', '10.1016/s0167-4781(01)00189-0 [doi]']",,,,,,"['GENBANK/AB313396', 'GENBANK/AB313397', 'GENBANK/AB313398', 'GENBANK/AB313399', 'GENBANK/AB313400', 'GENBANK/AB313401', 'GENBANK/AB313402', 'GENBANK/AB313403', 'GENBANK/AB313404']",,,,,,,,

As determined by 5'-rapid amplification of cDNA ends (5'-RACE), approximately 93% of the RFC transcripts in wild-type cells contained the KS43 5'-untranslated region transcribed from the RFC-B promoter. KS43 transcripts decreased > 90% in K500E cells. The basal and full-length RFC-B promoters were more active (3- and 2-fold, respectively) in directing transcription of a luciferase reporter gene in K500E than in wild-type cells. Treatment with a demethylating agent, 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine, or with a histone deacetylase inhibitor, trichostatin A, did not increase the levels of RFC transcripts in K500E cells. No differences in RFC gene structure were detected between the lines on Southern blots; however, the RFC signals were decreased approximately 60% in K500E cells. DNA sequences were identical between the lines for the RFC coding region and the two 5'-non-coding exons and their respective promoters. Spectral karyotype analysis and fluorescence in situ hybridization in wild-type cells showed two normal chromosome 21 copies and one or two marker chromosomes, each with an RFC signal. In K500E cells, the RFC gene locus was no longer localized to a normal chromosome 21 (at 21q22.2), and a single RFC signal was associated with a small metacentric chromosome, characterized by a 21/22 translocation. Our results suggest that loss of RFC transcripts in K500E cells is unrelated to changes in the levels of critical transcription factors, or to differences in the extent of RFC promoter methylation or core histone deacetylation. Rather, this phenotype is due to the loss of one or more RFC alleles, and to a translocation of the remaining RFC allele with the formation of a 21/22 fusion chromosome.","['Ding, B C', 'Witt, T L', 'Hukku, B', 'Heng, H', 'Zhang, L', 'Matherly, L H']","['Ding BC', 'Witt TL', 'Hukku B', 'Heng H', 'Zhang L', 'Matherly LH']","['Department of Pharmacology, Wayne State University School of Medicine, Detroit, MI 48201, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Biochem Pharmacol,Biochemical pharmacology,0101032,"[""0 (5' Untranslated Regions)"", '0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Histones)', '0 (Hydroxamic Acids)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Membrane Transport Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Reduced Folate Carrier Protein)', '0 (SLC19A1 protein, human)', '0 (SLC19A2 protein, human)', '3X2S926L3Z (trichostatin A)', '776B62CQ27 (Decitabine)', 'M801H13NRU (Azacitidine)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"[""5' Untranslated Regions/genetics"", 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology', 'Azacitidine/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Biological Transport', 'Carrier Proteins/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'DNA Methylation', 'Decitabine', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/genetics', '*Gene Deletion', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Genes, Reporter', 'Histones/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Hydroxamic Acids/pharmacology', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'K562 Cells', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*genetics', '*Membrane Proteins', '*Membrane Transport Proteins', 'Methotrexate/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/physiology', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis', 'Reduced Folate Carrier Protein', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', '*Translocation, Genetic']",,2001/03/27 10:00,2001/04/21 10:01,['2001/03/27 10:00'],"['2001/03/27 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/04/21 10:01 [medline]', '2001/03/27 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Biochem Pharmacol. 2001 Mar 15;61(6):665-75. doi: 10.1016/s0006-2952(01)00535-4.,,,"['S0006295201005354 [pii]', '10.1016/s0006-2952(01)00535-4 [doi]']",,['CA53535/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,

Green fluorescent protein (GFP) fusions were made to full-length GRIP1, and a series of GRIP1 mutants lacking the defined regulatory regions and the intracellular distribution of these proteins was studied in HeLa cells. The distribution of GRIP1 was complex, ranging from diffuse nucleoplasmic to discrete intranuclear foci. Formation of these foci was dependent on the C-terminal region of GRIP1, which contains the two characterized transcriptional activation domains, AD1 and AD2. A subpopulation of GRIP1 foci associate with ND10s, small nuclear bodies that contain several proteins including PML, SP100, DAXX, and CREB-binding protein (CBP). Association with the ND10s is dependent on the AD1 of GRIP1, a region of the protein previously described as a CBP-interacting domain. The GRIP1 foci are enriched in components of the 26S proteasome, including the core 20S proteasome, PA28alpha, and ubiquitin. In addition, the irreversible proteasome inhibitor lactacystin induced an increase in the total fluorescence intensity of the GFP-GRIP1 expressing cells, demonstrating that GRIP1 is degraded by the proteasome. These findings suggest the intriguing possibility that degradation of GRIP1 by the 26S proteasome may be a key component of its regulation.","['Baumann, C T', 'Ma, H', 'Wolford, R', 'Reyes, J C', 'Maruvada, P', 'Lim, C', 'Yen, P M', 'Stallcup, M R', 'Hager, G L']","['Baumann CT', 'Ma H', 'Wolford R', 'Reyes JC', 'Maruvada P', 'Lim C', 'Yen PM', 'Stallcup MR', 'Hager GL']","['Laboratory of Receptor Biology and Gene Expression, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health Bethesda, Maryland 20892-5055, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Mol Endocrinol,"Molecular endocrinology (Baltimore, Md.)",8801431,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (Antigens, Nuclear)', '0 (Autoantigens)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Co-Repressor Proteins)', '0 (DAXX protein, human)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Luminescent Proteins)', '0 (Molecular Chaperones)', '0 (NCOA2 protein, human)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Receptor Coactivator 2)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (Protease Inhibitors)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '0 (Ubiquitins)', '133343-34-7 (lactacystin)', '135844-47-2 (Sp100 protein, human)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)', '147336-22-9 (Green Fluorescent Proteins)', 'EC 2.3.1.48 (CREB-Binding Protein)', 'EC 2.3.1.48 (CREBBP protein, human)', 'EC 2.3.1.48 (Nuclear Receptor Coactivator 3)', 'EC 3.4.- (Peptide Hydrolases)', 'EC 3.4.25.1 (Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex)', 'EC 3.4.99.- (ATP dependent 26S protease)', 'WYQ7N0BPYC (Acetylcysteine)']",IM,"['Acetylcysteine/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing', 'Amino Acid Sequence', '*Antigens, Nuclear', 'Autoantigens/metabolism', 'Base Sequence', 'Binding Sites', 'CREB-Binding Protein', 'Carrier Proteins/metabolism', 'Cell Nucleus Structures/*metabolism', 'Co-Repressor Proteins', 'Green Fluorescent Proteins', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', '*Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins', 'Luminescent Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Molecular Chaperones', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Neoplasm Proteins/metabolism', 'Nuclear Proteins/metabolism', 'Nuclear Receptor Coactivator 2', 'Nuclear Receptor Coactivator 3', 'Peptide Hydrolases/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'Protease Inhibitors/pharmacology', '*Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Sequence Deletion', 'Trans-Activators/metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins', 'Ubiquitins/metabolism']",,2001/03/27 10:00,2001/09/21 10:01,['2001/03/27 10:00'],"['2001/03/27 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/09/21 10:01 [medline]', '2001/03/27 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Mol Endocrinol. 2001 Apr;15(4):485-500. doi: 10.1210/mend.15.4.0618.,,,['10.1210/mend.15.4.0618 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We conducted a cohort study based on a population of 235,635 children born shortly after two different censuses in Sweden. The children were followed from birth to 14 years, and cases of cancer were identified in the Swedish Cancer Registry. Occupational hygienists assessed the probability of exposure to different agents in each combination of the father's industry and occupation as reported in the censuses. We also analyzed individual job titles. We compared the cancer incidence among children of exposed fathers to that among children of unexposed fathers using Cox proportional hazards modeling. The main findings were an increased risk of nervous system tumors related to paternal occupational exposure to pesticides [relative risk (RR) = 2.36; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.27-4.39] and work as a painter (RR = 3.65; 95% CI, 1.71-7.80), and an increased risk of leukemia related to wood work by fathers (RR = 2.18; 95% CI, 1.26-3.78). We found no associations between childhood leukemia and paternal exposure to pesticides or paint. Our results support previous findings of an increased risk of childhood brain tumors and leukemia associated with certain paternal occupational exposures.

Blood cells of ALL patients produced significantly less IL-1alpha, IL-1beta, IL-10 and TNF-alpha than control cells and not significanly lower levels of IL-6, but comparable with control levels of IL-2, IL-4. rHuGM-CSF added to cell cultures 24 h before induction significantly enhanced the production of IL-1alpha, IL-1beta and TNF-alpha in controls, but only IL-1alpha and IL-1beta in the blood cell cultures of patients with ALL. GM-CSF did not significantly influence the production of IFN-alpha, IFN-gamma, IL-2, IL-4 and IL-10 in the control cells and the cells of ALL patients. The patients examined differed not only in the expression of CD10 and CD34 antigens on blast cells, but also in the reaction to GM-CSF treatment, which was found as very high standard deviation values.

As in the human tumors, the murine translocation fuses the genes AML1 and ETO. We used homologous recombination to place loxP sites at loci that were syntenic with the break points for the human translocation. Cre activity was provided in mice by a transgene under the control of the Nestin promoter, or in cultured B cells by infecting with a retroviral vector encoding Cre. In both instances, Cre activity mediated interchromosomal translocations that fused the AML1 and ETO genes.

The study of the biological outcome of such events ideally requires recapitulation of the tissue specificity and timing of the chromosomal translocation itself. We have used the Cre-loxP system of phage P1 to induce de novo Mll-Af9 chromosomal recombination during mouse development. loxP sites were introduced into the Mll and Af9 genes on chromosomes 9 and 4, respectively, and mice carrying these alleles were crossed with mice expressing Cre recombinase. A resulting Mll-Af9 fusion gene was detected whose transcription and splicing were verified. Thus, programmed interchromosomal recombination can be achieved in mice. This approach should allow the design of mouse models of tumorigenesis with greater biological relevance than those available at present.","['Collins, E C', 'Pannell, R', 'Simpson, E M', 'Forster, A', 'Rabbitts, T H']","['Collins EC', 'Pannell R', 'Simpson EM', 'Forster A', 'Rabbitts TH']","['MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology, Cambridge, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,EMBO Rep,EMBO reports,100963049,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (KMT2A protein, human)', '0 (MLLT3 protein, human)', '0 (Mllt3 protein, mouse)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Viral Proteins)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', '63231-63-0 (RNA)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Kmt2a protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.7.- (Cre recombinase)', 'EC 2.7.7.- (Integrases)']",IM,"['Animals', '*Artificial Gene Fusion', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Embryo, Mammalian/physiology', 'Genetic Vectors', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase', 'Humans', 'Integrases/genetics/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein', 'Neoplasms/genetics', 'Nuclear Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', '*Proto-Oncogenes', 'RNA/metabolism', '*Recombination, Genetic', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', '*Transcription Factors', '*Translocation, Genetic', '*Viral Proteins']",,2001/03/27 10:00,2001/06/22 10:01,['2001/03/27 10:00'],"['2000/03/23 00:00 [received]', '2000/05/04 00:00 [revised]', '2000/05/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2001/03/27 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/06/22 10:01 [medline]', '2001/03/27 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,EMBO Rep. 2000 Aug;1(2):127-32. doi: 10.1093/embo-reports/kvd021.,,,"['10.1093/embo-reports/kvd021 [doi]', 'embor616 [pii]']",PMC1084253,['1R01MH/HD57465/MH/NIMH NIH HHS/United States'],,['EMBO Rep. 2000 Aug;1(2):120-1.

In this study, using two specific monoclonal antibodies [(mAb) MA152 and LAP171], we identified a triggering NK receptor expressed at the cell surface as a dimer of approximately 80 kDa (NKp80). NKp80 is expressed by virtually all fresh or activated NK cells and by a minor subset of T cells characterized by the CD56 surface antigen. NKp80 surface expression was also detected in all CD3- and in 6 / 10 CD3+ large granular lymphocyte expansions derived from patients with lymphoproliferative disease of granular lymphocytes. In polyclonal NK cells, mAb-mediated cross-linking of NKp80 resulted in induction of cytolytic activity and Ca2+ mobilization. A marked heterogeneity existed in the magnitude of the cytolytic responses of different NK cell clones to anti-NKp80 mAb. This heterogeneity correlated with the surface density of NKp46 molecules expressed by different NK clones. The mAb-mediated masking of NKp80 led to a partial inhibition of the NK-mediated lysis of appropriate allogeneic phytohemagglutinin-induced T cell blasts, while it had no effect on the lysis of different tumor target cells, including T cell leukemia cells. These data suggest that NKp80 recognizes a ligand on normal T cells that may be down-regulated during tumor transformation. Molecular cloning of the cDNA coding for NKp80 revealed a type II transmembrane molecule of 231 amino acids identical to the putative protein encoded by a recently identified cDNA termed KLRF1.","['Vitale, M', 'Falco, M', 'Castriconi, R', 'Parolini, S', 'Zambello, R', 'Semenzato, G', 'Biassoni, R', 'Bottino, C', 'Moretta, L', 'Moretta, A']","['Vitale M', 'Falco M', 'Castriconi R', 'Parolini S', 'Zambello R', 'Semenzato G', 'Biassoni R', 'Bottino C', 'Moretta L', 'Moretta A']","['Istituto Nazionale per la Ricerca sul Cancro, Genova, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Eur J Immunol,European journal of immunology,1273201,"['0 (Antigens, Surface)', '0 (Receptors, Immunologic)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Antigens, Surface/analysis', 'Calcium/metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*chemistry', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Middle Aged', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Receptors, Immunologic/*analysis/genetics/physiology']",,2001/03/27 10:00,2001/04/03 10:01,['2001/03/27 10:00'],"['2001/03/27 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/04/03 10:01 [medline]', '2001/03/27 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Eur J Immunol. 2001 Jan;31(1):233-42. doi: 10.1002/1521-4141(200101)31:1<233::AID-IMMU233>3.0.CO;2-4.,,,['10.1002/1521-4141(200101)31:1<233::AID-IMMU233>3.0.CO;2-4 [doi]'],,['E.0892/Telethon/Italy'],,,,,,,,,,,,

For example, the increased deposition of extracellular matrix (ECM) at focal sites in the airway wall is seen in asthma and all interstitial lung diseases that involve fibrosis.

These two steps are mediated by the surface (SU) and transmembrane (TM) subunits of the retroviral envelope glycoprotein (Env), respectively. Determinants regulating membrane fusion have been described throughout SU and TM, but the processes coupling receptor recognition to fusion are still elusive. Here we establish that a critical interaction is formed between the receptor-binding domain (RBD) and the major disulfide loop of the carboxy-terminal domain (C domain) of the murine leukemia virus SU. Receptor binding causes an alteration of this interaction and, in turn, promotes further events of Env fusion activation. We characterize mutations which, by lowering this interaction and reducing the compatibility between the RBD and C domains of Env glycoprotein chimeras, affect both Env fusogenicity and sensitivity to receptor interference. Additionally, we demonstrate that suboptimal interactions in such mutant Env proteins can be compensated in trans by soluble RBDs in a manner that depends on their compatibility with the C domain. Our results therefore indicate that RBD/C domain interactions may occur in cis, via the proper RBD of the viral Env itself, or in trans, via a distinct RBD expressed by virion-free Env glycoproteins expressed endogenously by the infected cells or provided by neighboring Env trimers.","['Lavillette, D', 'Boson, B', 'Russell, S J', 'Cosset, F L']","['Lavillette D', 'Boson B', 'Russell SJ', 'Cosset FL']","['Laboratoire de Vectorologie Retrovirale et Therapie Genique, INSERM U412, Ecole Normale Superieure de Lyon and IFR 74, Lyon, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Disulfides)', '0 (Gene Products, env)', '0 (Glycoproteins)', '0 (Peptide Fragments)', '0 (Receptors, Virus)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Disulfides/*metabolism', 'Gene Products, env/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Glycoproteins/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/genetics/*metabolism/physiology', '*Membrane Fusion', 'Models, Biological', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutation', 'Peptide Fragments/chemistry/genetics/metabolism', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Receptors, Virus/*metabolism', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/chemistry/metabolism', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Solubility', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,2001/03/27 10:00,2001/04/17 10:01,['2001/03/27 10:00'],"['2001/03/27 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/04/17 10:01 [medline]', '2001/03/27 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Virol. 2001 Apr;75(8):3685-95. doi: 10.1128/JVI.75.8.3685-3695.2001.,,,['10.1128/JVI.75.8.3685-3695.2001 [doi]'],PMC114860,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The use of HIV-1-based vectors to express TdRev would have the advantage of allowing access to nondividing hematopoietic cells. It would also provide additional levels of protection by sequestering the viral regulatory proteins Tat and Rev, competing for encapsidation into wild-type virions, and inhibiting reverse transcription. Here we describe HIV-1-based vectors that express TdRev. These vectors contain mutations in the splicing signals or replacement of the Rev-responsive element by the simian retrovirus type 1 constitutive transport element, making them less sensitive to the inhibitory effects of TdRev. In addition, overexpression of Rev and the use of an HIV-1 helper plasmid that drives high levels of Gag-Pol synthesis were used to transiently overcome the inhibition by TdRev of the synthesis of Gag-Pol during vector production. SupT1 cells transduced with these vectors were more resistant to HIV-1 replication than cells transduced with Moloney murine leukemia virus-based vectors expressing TdRev. Furthermore, we show that these vectors can be mobilized by the wild-type virus, reducing the infectivity of virions escaping inhibition and conferring protection against HIV-1 replication to previously untransduced cells.","['Mautino, M R', 'Keiser, N', 'Morgan, R A']","['Mautino MR', 'Keiser N', 'Morgan RA']","['Clinical Gene Therapy Branch, National Human Genome Research Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland 20892-1851, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Fusion Proteins, gag-pol)', '0 (Gene Products, rev)', '0 (HIV Core Protein p24)', '0 (rev Gene Products, Human Immunodeficiency Virus)']",IM,"['Blotting, Southern', 'Cell Line', 'Fusion Proteins, gag-pol/biosynthesis', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Products, rev/genetics/*physiology', 'Genetic Therapy', 'Genetic Vectors/*genetics', 'HIV Core Protein p24/biosynthesis', 'HIV-1/*genetics/growth & development/metabolism/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/genetics', 'Proviruses/genetics', 'T-Lymphocytes/metabolism/virology', 'Transduction, Genetic', 'Virus Assembly', '*Virus Replication', 'rev Gene Products, Human Immunodeficiency Virus']",,2001/03/27 10:00,2001/04/17 10:01,['2001/03/27 10:00'],"['2001/03/27 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/04/17 10:01 [medline]', '2001/03/27 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Virol. 2001 Apr;75(8):3590-9. doi: 10.1128/JVI.75.8.3590-3599.2001.,,,['10.1128/JVI.75.8.3590-3599.2001 [doi]'],PMC114850,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Previously, HTLV-I- infected T-cell clones were found to be resistant to growth inhibition by transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta. Here it is shown that Tax can perturb Smad-dependent TGF-beta signaling even though no direct interaction of Tax and Smad proteins could be detected. Importantly, a mutant Tax of CREB-binding protein (CBP)/p300 binding site, could not repress the Smad transactivation function, suggesting that the CBP/p300 binding domain of Tax is essential for the suppression of Smad function. Because both Tax and Smad are known to interact with CBP/p300 for the potentiation of their transcriptional activities, the effect of CBP/p300 on suppression of Smad-mediated transactivation by Tax was examined. Overexpression of CBP/p300 reversed Tax-mediated inhibition of Smad transactivation. Furthermore, Smad could repress Tax transcriptional activation, indicating reciprocal repression between Tax and Smad. These results suggest that Tax interferes with the recruitment of CBP/p300 into transcription initiation complexes on TGF-beta-responsive elements through its binding to CBP/p300. The novel function of Tax as a repressor of TGF-beta signaling may contribute to HTLV-I leukemogenesis.

This study has tested the hypothesis that adhesion receptors and cytokines secreted by blast cells play central roles in these reactions. Immunophenotypic studies showed that acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells (n = 78) of the M0 to M5 subtypes of the French-American-British Cooperative Group expressed various amounts of adhesion receptors, including CD11a, b, c/CD18, CD49d, e, f/CD29, CD54, sCD15, and L-selectin. The presence of functional adhesion receptors was evaluated using a nonstatic adhesion assay. The number of blast cells attached to unactivated endothelium increased by 7 to 31 times after a 6-hour exposure of endothelium to tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha. Inhibition studies showed that multiple adhesion receptors--including L-selectin, E-selectin, VCAM-1, and CD11/CD18--were involved in blast cell adhesion to TNF-alpha-activated endothelium. Leukemic cells were then cocultured at 37 degrees C on unactivated endothelial cell monolayers for time periods up to 24 hours. A time-dependent increase in the number of blasts attached to the endothelium and a concomitant induction of ICAM-1, VCAM-1, and E-selectin were observed. Additional experiments revealed that endothelial cell activation by leukemic myeloblasts was caused by cytokine secretion by blast cells, in particular TNF-alpha and IL-1 beta, and direct contacts between adhesion receptors expressed by blast cells and endothelial cells. Thus, leukemic cells have the ability to generate conditions that promote their own adhesion to vascular endothelium, a property that may have important implications for the pathophysiology of leukostasis and tissue infiltration by leukemic blast cells.

By cDNA array analysis, 334 of 4132 genes studied were expressed 1.5- to 5.8-fold higher in leukemic cells relative to both normal samples; 238 of these genes were also overexpressed in the leukemic cell line RS4;11. Nine genes were selected among the 274 overexpressed in at least 2 leukemic samples, and expression of the encoded proteins was measured by flow cytometry. Two proteins (caldesmon and myeloid nuclear differentiation antigen) were only weakly expressed in leukemic cells despite strong hybridization signals in the array. By contrast, 7 proteins (CD58, creatine kinase B, ninjurin1, Ref1, calpastatin, HDJ-2, and annexin VI) were expressed in B-lineage ALL cells at higher levels than in normal CD19(+)CD10(+) B-cell progenitors (P <.05 in all comparisons). CD58 was chosen for further analysis because of its abundant and prevalent overexpression. An anti-CD58 antibody identified residual leukemic cells (0.01% to 1.13%; median, 0.03%) in 9 of 104 bone marrow samples from children with ALL in clinical remission. MRD estimates by CD58 staining correlated well with those of polymerase chain reaction amplification of immunoglobulin genes. These results indicate that studies of gene expression with cDNA arrays can aid the discovery of leukemia markers.

This effect was blocked by cycloheximide, but not by alpha-amanitin or actinomycin D. Qualitatively similar interactions were observed with other PKC activators (eg, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate and mezerein), but not phospholipase C, which does not down-regulate the enzyme. These events were examined in relationship to functional alterations in stress (eg, SAPK, JNK) and survival (eg, MAPK, ERK) signaling pathways. The observations that LC/BRY treatment failed to trigger JNK activation and that cell death was unaffected by a dominant-interfering form of c-JUN (TAM67) or by pretreatment with either curcumin or the p38/RK inhibitor, SB203580, suggested that the SAPK pathway was not involved in potentiation of apoptosis. In marked contrast, perturbations in the PKC/Raf/MAPK pathway played an integral role in LC/BRY-mediated cell death based on evidence that pretreatment of cells with bisindolylmaleimide I, a selective PKC inhibitor, or geldanamycin, a benzoquinone ansamycin, which destabilizes and depletes Raf-1, markedly suppressed apoptosis. Furthermore, ERK phosphorylation was substantially prolonged in LC/BRY-treated cells compared to those exposed to BRY alone, and pretreatment with the highly specific MEK inhibitors, PD98059, U0126, and SL327, opposed ERK activation while protecting cells from LC/BRY-induced lethality. Together, these findings suggest a role for activation and/or dysregulation of the PKC/MAPK cascade in modulation of leukemic cell apoptosis following exposure to the proteasome inhibitor LC.

In previous studies the minimal region of deletion (MDR) was mapped to a less than 300-kilobase (kb) interval bordered by the markers 173a12-82 and 138G4/1.3R. For the identification of the putative tumor suppressor gene, the entire MDR (approximately 347 kb) has been sequenced, and transcribed regions have been identified by exon trapping, EST-based full-length complementary DNA cloning, database homology searches, and computer-assisted gene prediction analyses. The MDR contains 2 pseudogenes and 3 transcribed genes: CAR, encoding a putative RING-finger containing protein; 1B4/Leu2, generating noncoding transcripts; and EST70/Leu1, probably representing another noncoding gene (longest open reading frame of 78 codons). These genes have been sequenced in 20 B-CLL cases with 13q14 hemizygous deletion, and no mutations were found. Moreover, no somatic variants were found in the entire MDR analyzed for nucleotide substitutions by a combination of direct sequencing and fluorescence-assisted mismatch analysis in 5 B-CLL cases displaying 13q14-monoallelic deletion. The nondeleted allele of the CAR and EST70/Leu1 genes was expressed in B-CLL specimens, including those with monoallelic loss, whereas no expression of 1B4/Leu2 was detectable in B-CLL, regardless of the 13q14 status.

Its pathogenetic role in AML and in the cell cycle of leukemic blasts is unknown. B-myb is essential for G1/S transition and has been shown to be phosphorylated by the cyclin A2/cdk2 complex. Here it is demonstrated that cyclin A1 interacts with the C-terminal portion of B-myb as shown by glutathione S-transferase (GST) precipitation. This interaction is confined to cyclin A1 because binding could not be detected between cyclin A2 and B-myb. Also, cdk2 was not pulled down by GST-B-myb from U937 lysates. In addition, co-immunoprecipitation of cyclin A1 and B-myb in leukemic cells evidenced protein interaction in vivo. Baculovirus-expressed cyclin A1/cdk2 complexes were able to phosphorylate human as well as murine B-myb in vitro. Tryptic phosphopeptide mapping revealed that cyclin A1/cdk2 complexes phosphorylated the C-terminal part of B-myb at several sites including threonine 447, 490, and 497 and serine 581. These phosphorylation sites have been demonstrated to be important for the enhancement of B-myb transcriptional activity. Further studies showed that cyclin A1 cooperated with B-myb to transactivate myb binding site containing promoters including the promoter of the human cyclin A1 gene. Taken together, the data suggest that cyclin A1 is a tissue-specific regulator of B-myb function and activates B-myb in leukemic blasts.

DNA-PKcs down-regulation is a proteasome-dependent degradation that requires tyrosine kinase activity and is associated with a marked DNA repair deficiency along with increased sensitivity to ionizing radiation. The conjunction of a major DNA repair deficiency and a resistance to apoptosis, both induced by BCR-ABL, provides a new mechanism to explain how secondary genetic alterations can accumulate in CML, eventually leading to blast crisis. The down-regulation of DNA-PKcs was reversible in CD34(+) CML cells suggesting that this approach might offer a novel and powerful therapeutic strategy in this disease, especially to delay the blast crisis.

Here, we demonstrate that CD4(+)V alpha 24NKT cells derived from a patient with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) M4 are phenotypically similar to those of healthy donors and, in common with those derived from healthy donors, express tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) when the cells are activated by alpha-GalCer-pulsed dendritic cells but not prior to activation. We also show that myeloid leukemia cells from patients with AML M4, but not from patients with AML M0 or M1, undergo apoptosis following culture with TRAIL-expressing autologous or allogeneic healthy donor V alpha 24NKT cells. Apoptosis of AML M4 leukemia cells from patient peripheral blood was almost completely blocked by a neutralizing monoclonal antibody against TRAIL, indicating that TRAIL on V alpha 24NKT cells is essential for the induction of apoptosis in AML M4 leukemia cells. A nonobese diabetic-severe combined immunodeficient human leukemia (AML M4) model showed that human activated CD4(+)V alpha 24NKT cells induced apoptosis of human leukemia cells in vivo. This is the first evidence that activated V alpha 24NKT cells express TRAIL and that TRAIL causes apoptosis of monocytic leukemia cells from patients with AML M4 in vitro and in vivo.

AG490 is an inhibitor of the PTK Janus kinase 2 (JAK2). No direct comparison of these inhibitors has previously been reported, so this study compared their effects on factor-dependent FDC-P1, 32D, and MO7e cells and their p210(bcr-abl)-expressing factor-independent derivatives. STI571 was a more potent inhibitor of (3)H-thymidine incorporation in p210(bcr-abl)-expressing cells than was AG957, and it showed superior discrimination between inhibitory effects on parental cell lines and effects on their p210(bcr-abl)-expressing derivatives. Assays performed with and without growth factor demonstrated that STI571 but not AG957 reversed the p210(bcr-abl)-driven factor independence of cell lines. p210(bcr-abl)-expressing cells were less sensitive to AG490 than to AG957 or STI571. However, for p210(bcr-abl)-expressing clones from all 3 cell lines, synergistic inhibition was demonstrated between STI571 and concentrations of AG490 with no independent inhibitory effect. Inhibition of nucleic acid synthesis with AG957 treatment was associated with reduced cell numbers, reduced viability, and small pyknotic apoptotic cells. At concentrations of STI571 that reversed the p210(bcr-abl) factor-independent phenotype, STI571 treatment and growth factor deprivation together were sufficient to induce apoptosis. This study concludes that, for the cell lines studied, (1) STI571 is a more potent and more selective inhibitor of a p210(bcr-abl)-dependent phenotype than AG957; (2) AG490 synergizes with STI571 to enhance its inhibitory effect on p210(bcr-abl)-driven proliferation; and (3) the combination of p210(bcr-abl)-tyrosine kinase inhibition and growth factor signal withdrawal can be sufficient to induce apoptotic death of transformed cells.

STI571 is a novel anticancer agent that selectively inhibits the BCR/ABL tyrosine kinase. The cytotoxic effects of STI571 were studied in combination with antileukemic agents against Ph(+) leukemia cell lines, KU812, K-562, TCC-S, and TCC-Y. The cells were exposed to STI571 and to other agents simultaneously for 5 or 7 days. Cell growth inhibition was determined by MTT assay. The cytotoxic effects in combinations at the inhibitory concentration of 80% level were evaluated by the isobologram. STI571 produced synergistic effects with recombinant and natural alpha-interferons in 2 of 3 and 3 of 3 cell lines, respectively. STI571 produced additive effects with hydroxyurea, cytarabine, homoharringtonine, doxorubicin, and etoposide in all 4 cell lines. STI571 with 4-hydroperoxy-cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, or vincristine produced additive, antagonistic, and synergistic effects in 3 of 4 cell lines, respectively. These findings suggest that the simultaneous administration of STI571 with other agents except methotrexate would be advantageous for cytotoxic effects against Ph(+) leukemias. Among them, the simultaneous administration of STI571 and alpha-interferons or vincristine would be highly effective against Ph(+) leukemias and these combinations would be worthy of clinical trials. In contrast, the simultaneous administration of STI571 with methotrexate would have little therapeutic efficacy. Although there are gaps between in vitro studies and clinical trials, the present findings provide useful information for the establishment of clinical protocols involving STI571.

The eGFP-specific CTL responses were MHC-restricted, mediated by CD8(+) lymphocytes, and directed against multiple epitopes. eGFP-specific CTLs were able to efficiently lyse autologous CD34(+) cells expressing eGFP. Antibody responses to eGFP were detected in 3 of 6 animals. These data document the potential for foreign proteins expressed in CD34(+) hematopoietic cells and their progeny to induce antibody and CTL responses in the setting of a clinically applicable transplantation protocol.

The clone-specific region of highest diversity, CDR-III, was PCR amplified and sequenced. Nested CDR-III clonotypic primers were used in a semi-nested cPCR with a sensitivity of at least 1 in 10(5) cells. Patients with protocol-eligible Rai intermediate or high-risk chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) received induction with fludarabine 25 mg/m(2) per day for 5 days every 4 weeks for 6 cycles, followed by consolidative high-dose cyclophosphamide (1.5, 2.25, or 3g/m(2)). cPCR was performed on peripheral blood and bone marrow mononuclear cells. All 5 patients achieving a clinical partial remission (PR) studied by cPCR were positive. Five patients achieved nodular PR (nPR) (residual nodules or suspicious lymphocytic infiltrates in a bone marrow biopsy as the sole suggestion of residual disease). Five of 5 patients with nPR were cPCR positive. In contrast, flow cytometry for CD5-CD19 dual staining and kappa--lambda clonal excess detected MRD in only 3 of the same 5 nPR patients, all of whom were cPCR positive, and immunohistochemistry detected MRD in only 1 of 4 assessable patients. Three of 7 CR patients evaluable by cPCR had MRD. Only 1 CR patient had MRD by flow cytometry; that patient was also cPCR positive. These data support the conclusions that nodular PR in CLL represents MRD and that clonotypic PCR detects MRD in CLL more frequently than flow cytometry or immunohistochemistry.

Such peculiar HLA class I expression would allow tumor cells to escape not only from CD8+T but also from NK-cell cytotoxicity. We studied the cell surface expression of HLA-G using flow cytometry with two HLA-G specific monoclonal antibodies (87G, 01G). The JEG-3 choriocarcinoma cell line, which constitutively expresses HLA-G antigens was used as a positive control. We did not detect the cell-surface HLA-G antigens in the following 75 tumor cell lines: melanoma (22), neuroblastoma (7), retinoblastoma (1), glioma (2), breast carcinoma (3), ovarian carcinoma (3), cervical carcinoma (1), colon carcinoma (3), bladder carcinoma (2), hepatocarcinoma (1), sarcoma (2) and leukemia cell lines: T-lymphocytes (6), B-lymphocytes (13) and myelo-monocytes (9). We found that some myelomonocytic cell lines express on their surface high affinity FcgammaRI (CD64) that may result in the binding of HLA-G specific mabs to their cell surface even in the absence of HLA-G molecules. Our panel of HLA-G negative tumor cell lines accommodated 62 cell lines for which similar analysis have not been reported and also contained 13 cell lines with total or partial loss of HLA class Ia molecules.

The purpose of this review is to consider the present possibilities and limitations of enzyme cytochemistry and to emphasize how cytochemistry may contribute to the final classification and differential diagnosis of acute myeloid leukemia. The role of conventional enzyme cytochemistry, either dominant or subsidiary, in the discrimination of acute myeloid leukemia subgroups is discussed. The survey confirms the necessity of immunological marker analysis in the accurate diagnosis of minimally differentiated myeloid leukemias and acute leukemia of megakaryocytic lineage. In these cases, the cytochemical evaluation provides insufficiently relevant information regarding blast cell origin. On the other hand, cytochemical investigation is appreciated to be dominant over immunophenotyping in characterizing majority of acute myeloid leukemia subgroups, because of the availability of standardized and sufficiently specific cytochemical reactions and, because of the lack of specificity of the many of immunological markers against myeloid antigens. The immunocytochemical, cytogenetic, molecular biology and electron microscopic studies shortly mentioned in this review supplement the information for correct diagnosis of acute myeloid leukemia.","['Klobusicka, M']",['Klobusicka M'],"['Cancer Research Institute, Slovak Academy of Sciences, Bratislava, Slovak Republic. exonklo@savba.sk']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",Slovakia,Neoplasma,Neoplasma,0377266,"['0 (Enzymes)', 'EC 1.11.1.7 (Peroxidase)', 'EC 3.1.1.- (Carboxylic Ester Hydrolases)', 'EC 3.1.1.- (chloroacetate esterase)', 'EC 3.1.1.- (naphthylbutyrate esterase)']",IM,"['Carboxylic Ester Hydrolases/biosynthesis', 'Enzymes/*analysis', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry/*methods', 'Immunophenotyping/methods', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*diagnosis/*metabolism', 'Peroxidase/biosynthesis']",65,2001/03/27 10:00,2001/04/17 10:01,['2001/03/27 10:00'],"['2001/03/27 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/04/17 10:01 [medline]', '2001/03/27 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Neoplasma. 2000;47(6):329-34.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHOD: As2O3 was administered intravenously at the dose of 10 mg per day for the treatment of 8 relapsed acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) patients. The arsenic content was measured by Gas-phase chromatography. RESULTS: The plasma maximal concentration (Cpmax) was 0.94 +/- 0.37 mg/L (x +/- s), time to peak concentration (Tp) was 4 hours, plasma distribution half-time (t1/2 alpha) and elimination half-time (t1/2 beta) were 0.89 +/- 0.29 hours and 12.13 +/- 3.31 hours, respectively. Apparent distribution volume (Vc) was 3.83 +/- 0.45 L, system clearance (CLs) was 1.43 +/- 0.17 L/h, and area under curve (AUC) was 7.25 +/- 0.97 mg.h/L. The continuous administration of As2O3 did not alter its pharmacokinetic behaviors. During As2O3 treatment, 24-hour arsenic content in urine accounted for 1%-8% of the daily dose (10 mg). When arsenic accumulation in hair and nail increased continuously, the peak concentration could be five to seven-fold higher than that of pre-treatment.

METHODS: RT-PCR was used to detect gene expression of cytokines including IL-1, IL-3, IL-6, TGF beta 1 and their receptors (R) in leukemic and normal cells. Leukemic colony assay was carried out to determine the effect of TGF beta 1 on the growth of leukemic cells and the serum TGF beta 1 level in 33 AL patients were measured by ELISA. RESULTS: TGF beta 1 was found to significantly inhibit the proliferation of leukemia cells of HL-60, K562 and DAMI cell lines. Furthermore, a variety of leukemia cell lines including HEL, HL-60, K562, U937, DAMI, MEG-01, HUT78 and CA were found to express mRNAs for TGF beta 1 and its receptor. In addition, TGF beta 1 was found to be able to evidently down-regulate the expression of mRNAs for IL-6, IL-6R, IL-3, GM-CSFR in DAMI cells and, interestingly, up-regulate TGF beta 1 gene expression in the cells per se before the cells showed DNA fragmentation, a molecular hallmark for cell apoptosis. It was shown that serum TGF beta 1 levels were significantly decreased in leukemic patients, restored to normal in the patients achieved complete remission, and tended to decrease again in the recurrent patients. CONCLUSION: 1. TGF beta 1 may act as an inhibitory autocrine factor in the proliferation of leukemia cells; 2. the mechanism by which TGF beta 1 inhibits the growth of leukemia cells involves its down-regulating expression of positive cytokines and receptors and up-regulating TGF beta 1 expression in leukemia cells per se; 3. serum TGF beta 1 is a valuable parameter in monitoring the prognosis of leukemia and weakened control of TGF beta 1 on leukemia cells may play an important role in the pathogenesis of AL.","['Chen, Y', 'Lu, L', 'Wang, L']","['Chen Y', 'Lu L', 'Wang L']","['Fujian Institute of Hematology, Fujian Medical University, Fuzhou 350001.']",['chi'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",China,Zhonghua Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi,Zhonghua xue ye xue za zhi = Zhonghua xueyexue zazhi,8212398,"['0 (Receptors, Transforming Growth Factor beta)', '0 (TGFB1 protein, human)', '0 (Transforming Growth Factor beta)', '0 (Transforming Growth Factor beta1)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Apoptosis', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*blood/genetics', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/blood/genetics', 'Receptors, Transforming Growth Factor beta/*genetics', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Transforming Growth Factor beta/*blood/genetics', 'Transforming Growth Factor beta1']",,2001/03/27 10:00,2001/04/17 10:01,['2001/03/27 10:00'],"['2001/03/27 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/04/17 10:01 [medline]', '2001/03/27 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Zhonghua Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi. 1998 Nov;19(11):576-80.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS AND RESULTS: The original erythroblastic leukemia (EL) mouse was obtained by 7,12-DMBA induction. The spleen cell suspension from the original EL mouse was injected into the same inbred BALB/c strain mice. After successive transplantation for 20 generations, the incidence of EL was 100% without spontaneous remission. There was a linear relationship between the survival time of the EL mice and the number of leukemic cells inoculated. When 10(6) leukemic cells were inoculated intravenously, the EL mice survived 10.2 +/- 1.3 days. Invasion of leukemic cells involved mainly in the bone marrow, the spleen and the liver. There was no obvious infiltration of leukemic cells in lymph-nodes and thymus. In peripheral blood, there were a large number of leukemic cells and most of them were basophilic or polychromatophilic erythroblasts. At the advanced stage, the mice developed anemia and thrombocytopenia. The reaction of the leukemic cells for hemoglobin staining was positive or weakly positive. While the peroxydase reaction was negative, Thy-1 antigen and Fc-recepter were not presented. No virus-like particles was found in the cells under electron microscope. EL9611 leukemia model was sensitive to some antitumor drugs used in clinical therapy. CONCLUSION: The establishment of EL9611 leukemia model offered a useful tool for studying proliferation and differentiation of erythroid cells, as well as pathogenesis and experimental treatment of non-virus erythroid malignancy.","['Ding, S', 'Chu, J', 'Zhao, J']","['Ding S', 'Chu J', 'Zhao J']","['State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology, CAMS and PUMC, Tianjin 300020.']",['chi'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",China,Zhonghua Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi,Zhonghua xue ye xue za zhi = Zhonghua xueyexue zazhi,8212398,"['57-97-6 (9,10-Dimethyl-1,2-benzanthracene)']",IM,"['9,10-Dimethyl-1,2-benzanthracene', 'Animals', '*Disease Models, Animal', 'Female', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/chemically induced/*pathology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Neoplasm Transplantation']",,2001/03/27 10:00,2001/05/01 10:01,['2001/03/27 10:00'],"['2001/03/27 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/05/01 10:01 [medline]', '2001/03/27 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Zhonghua Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi. 1998 Dec;19(12):638-41.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The gender ratio (female/male ratio) of the HU patients was 2.0 and the initial complications were foggy vision in 34.5%, ocular floaters in 33.3%, and blurred vision in 15.5%. As for the ocular symptoms, the majority (78.6%) of patients were classified as intermediate uveitis with vitreous inflammation. Recurrence of uveitis episodes was seen in one half of the patients (51.8%); 12 patients had more than six uveitis episodes. The interval of uveitis episodes varied from two weeks to 10 years. Nearly one half of the patients (43.8%) had ocular complications: e.g., cataract in 22 patients, persistent vitreous opacities in 17 patients, and glaucoma in 16 patients. Although the visual prognosis was essentially good, 11 patients had poor visual prognosis (<0.1). The causes of poor vision in these patients were cataract, cystoid macular edema, epiretinal membrane, and optic nerve atrophy. Of the 112 HU patients, two developed HTLV-I-associated myelopathy (TSP/HAM) after the onset of HU, while none developed adult T-cell leukemia. Sixteen HU patients had a previous history of Graves' disease and a past history of methimazole therapy, while Graves' disease was found in another HU patient only after HU onset and methimazole was not administered before the onset of HU. The present data of long-term follow-up indicate that (1) HU causes various ocular complications and its visual prognosis can be poor, (2) TSP/HAM can be induced even after the onset of HU, and (3) methimazole is not a risk factor of HU after Graves' disease.","['Takahashi, T', 'Takase, H', 'Urano, T', 'Sugita, S', 'Miyata, K', 'Miyata, N', 'Mochizuki, M']","['Takahashi T', 'Takase H', 'Urano T', 'Sugita S', 'Miyata K', 'Miyata N', 'Mochizuki M']","['Department of Ophthalmology & Visual Science, Tokyo Medical and Dental University Graduate School, Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",England,Ocul Immunol Inflamm,Ocular immunology and inflammation,9312169,['0 (HTLV-I Antibodies)'],IM,"['Adult', 'Age Distribution', 'Age of Onset', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Anterior Chamber/pathology/virology', 'Deltaretrovirus Infections/*diagnosis/drug therapy/virology', 'Eye Infections, Viral/*diagnosis/drug therapy/virology', 'Female', 'Fluorescein Angiography', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Fundus Oculi', 'HTLV-I Antibodies/analysis', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Sex Distribution', 'Uveitis/*diagnosis/drug therapy/virology', 'Visual Acuity', 'Vitreous Body/pathology/virology']",,2001/03/23 10:00,2001/06/08 10:01,['2001/03/23 10:00'],"['2001/03/23 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/06/08 10:01 [medline]', '2001/03/23 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Ocul Immunol Inflamm. 2000 Dec;8(4):235-41. doi: 10.1076/ocii.8.4.235.6454.,,,['10.1076/ocii.8.4.235.6454 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To understand the precise role of the Prn-p gene in cell growth and differentiation we investigated the expression pattern of the Prn-p gene in proliferating cells and in cells arrested in growth either by confluency or by induction of terminal differentiation. Viral-transformed mouse spleen hematopoietic cells named murine erythroleukemia (MEL) and other types of inducible cells (human neuroectodermal RD/TE-671, myoid RD cells) were employed. Cells grown exponentially, at confluency, or irreversibly arrested in growth at terminal differentiation state were analyzed by fluorescence cell sorting and Northern blot hybridization to estimate the steady-state level of PrP mRNA at different phases of the cell cycle. MEL cells that failed to differentiate from treatment with N(6)-methyladenosine (N(6)mAdo), an inhibitor of differentiation, were also analyzed for PrP mRNA level. Our results indicate the following: (a) growth arrest of cells at G(1) phase by confluency or by induction of terminal differentiation led to increased accumulation of PrP mRNA transcripts, an event observed also in differentiated MEL, RD/TE-671, and RD cells independent of the inducer used; (b) treatment of MEL cells with N(6)mAdo prevented early activation of the Prn-p gene in cells treated with the inducer; and (c) cell-free nuclear run-off studies showed enhanced expression of the Prn-p gene due to transcriptional activation. These findings indicate, for the first time, that the Prn-p gene, which is thought to be a housekeeping gene, is transcriptionally activated in G(1) phase in confluent and terminally differentiated cells. This information may be valuable in understanding the overaccumulation of PrP in some differentiated tissues and may let us repress Prn-p gene activation by novel agents.","['Gougoumas, D D', 'Vizirianakis, I S', 'Tsiftsoglou, A S']","['Gougoumas DD', 'Vizirianakis IS', 'Tsiftsoglou AS']","['Laboratory of Pharmacology, Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, Thessaloniki, GR-54006, Greece.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Exp Cell Res,Experimental cell research,0373226,"['0 (PrPC Proteins)', '0 (Pyridines)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Sialoglycoproteins)', '141766-10-1 (2-(3-ethylureido)-6-methylpyridine)', '8W8T17847W (Urea)', 'CLE6G00625 (N-methyladenosine)', 'K72T3FS567 (Adenosine)', 'YOW8V9698H (Dimethyl Sulfoxide)']",IM,"['Adenosine/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Division', 'Dimethyl Sulfoxide/pharmacology', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute', 'Mice', 'PrPC Proteins/*genetics', 'Pyridines/pharmacology', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Sialoglycoproteins/*genetics', '*Transcriptional Activation', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Urea/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology']",,2001/03/23 10:00,2001/06/08 10:01,['2001/03/23 10:00'],"['2001/03/23 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/06/08 10:01 [medline]', '2001/03/23 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Exp Cell Res. 2001 Apr 1;264(2):408-17. doi: 10.1006/excr.2001.5151.,,['Copyright 2001 Academic Press.'],"['10.1006/excr.2001.5151 [doi]', 'S0014-4827(01)95151-1 [pii]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Using a recently developed flow cytometry technique to assess respiratory chain function, we have investigated the mechanism of reactive oxygen generation in OCI/AML-2 leukemic blasts following treatment with cytosine arabinoside, etoposide, and gamma-irradiation. Increases in mitochondrially generated reactive oxygen were seen using all three agents, in association with hyperpolarization of the mitochondrial inner membrane. Increased reactive oxygen occurred when mitochondria were energized using substrates for either complex I or complex II, indicating that the likely source is complex III (cytochrome c reductase). These findings are consistent with impaired adenine nucleotide exchange across the mitochondrial membrane, recently proposed to be an important event during the early stages of apoptosis induction (M. G. Vander Heiden et al., 1999, Mol. Cell 3, 159-167). Elevations of the antioxidants glutathione and thioredoxin occurred in association with this oxidative stress, likely the result of feedback mechanisms based on redox-sensitive transcription factors. Since glutathione and thioredoxin can protect from drug-induced apoptosis, their upregulation in response to respiratory chain-generated reactive oxygen might represent a cellular adaptation to DNA damage that promotes cell survival.","['Pham, N A', 'Hedley, D W']","['Pham NA', 'Hedley DW']","['Division of Experimental Therapeutics, Department of Medical Oncology and Hematology, Ontario Cancer Institute/ Princess Margaret Hospital, 610 University Avenue, Toronto, Ontario, M5G 2M9, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Exp Cell Res,Experimental cell research,0373226,"['0 (Ceramides)', '0 (Nucleic Acid Synthesis Inhibitors)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '52500-60-4 (Thioredoxins)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', 'EC 7.1.1.8 (Electron Transport Complex III)', 'KOO5CM684H (Digitonin)']",IM,"['*Apoptosis', 'Ceramides/pharmacology', 'Cytarabine/pharmacology', 'DNA Damage', 'Digitonin/metabolism', 'Electron Transport/physiology', 'Electron Transport Complex III/*metabolism/physiology', 'Etoposide/pharmacology', 'Gamma Rays', 'Leukemia', 'Mitochondria/drug effects/*metabolism/physiology', 'Nucleic Acid Synthesis Inhibitors/pharmacology', '*Oxidative Stress', 'Permeability', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/*metabolism', 'Thioredoxins/biosynthesis', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,2001/03/23 10:00,2001/06/08 10:01,['2001/03/23 10:00'],"['2001/03/23 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/06/08 10:01 [medline]', '2001/03/23 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Exp Cell Res. 2001 Apr 1;264(2):345-52. doi: 10.1006/excr.2000.5148.,,['Copyright 2001 Academic Press.'],"['10.1006/excr.2000.5148 [doi]', 'S0014-4827(00)95148-6 [pii]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The response of B-1 cells to mitogen after undergoing malignant transformation is still unclear. Using our established malignant B-1 cell lines derived from the NZB murine model of human CLL, we investigated the response of malignant B-1 cells to the mitogen LPS. Interestingly, these malignant B-1 cells proliferated initially, but the proliferation rate decreased after a 48-h transition. Prolonged LPS treatment induced apoptosis and pathological differentiation. We studied possible underlying molecular mechanisms and found that the level of the DNA binding protein BSAP (B-cell-specific activator protein) was upregulated by LPS at the initial activation stage, followed by an increase in the apoptotic factor caspase-3 (CPP32) at 48 h and a subsequent decrease of BSAP at 72 h. The pathological differentiation induced by LPS was partially prevented by treatment with antisense BSAP. This study indicates that malignant B-1 cells could be driven to apoptosis and pathological differentiation when activated by the mitogen LPS, and BSAP may be an important factor in regulating these responses.","['Zhang, M', 'Chong, S Y', 'Raveche, E S']","['Zhang M', 'Chong SY', 'Raveche ES']","['Department of Pathology, University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey, Newark, New Jersey 07103, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Exp Cell Res,Experimental cell research,0373226,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Lipopolysaccharides)', '0 (Mitogens)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Oligonucleotides, Antisense)', '0 (PAX5 Transcription Factor)', '0 (PAX5 protein, human)', '0 (Pax5 protein, mouse)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",IM,"['Animals', '*Apoptosis', 'B-Lymphocytes/cytology/drug effects/metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'DNA/metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/metabolism/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Lipopolysaccharides/pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Mitogens/pharmacology', 'Nuclear Proteins/genetics/metabolism/*physiology', 'Oligonucleotides, Antisense', 'PAX5 Transcription Factor', '*Transcription Factors']",,2001/03/23 10:00,2001/06/08 10:01,['2001/03/23 10:00'],"['2001/03/23 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/06/08 10:01 [medline]', '2001/03/23 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Exp Cell Res. 2001 Apr 1;264(2):233-43. doi: 10.1006/excr.2000.5122.,,['Copyright 2001 Academic Press.'],"['10.1006/excr.2000.5122 [doi]', 'S0014-4827(00)95122-X [pii]']",,['CA71478-10/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, the nuclear localization pattern and the putative association with cellular proteins have been determined during virus infection to shed light on the functional significance of the nuclear domains. IE2 was always localized to distinct nuclear structures while PE38 was partly present in nuclear dots. Confocal imaging indicated colocalization of PE38 and IE2 to common domains, prominently at 2 h p.i. The nuclear dot localization of PE38 in infected cells was different from that in transfected cells. Hence, we have performed cotransfection experiments that suggested that a viral factor influences the nuclear distribution. Since the promyelocytic leukemia protein (PML) that localizes to distinct nuclear multiprotein complexes termed ND10/PODs in mammalian cells functions as a target for some immediate early viral proteins, we have investigated whether baculovirus proteins act similarly. Transiently expressed IE2 and PE38 were found to be associated with endogenous PML in the mammalian cell line BHK21. Infection with a recombinant virus that expresses the human pml gene in insect cells reveals IE2 and PML to be colocalized during the early phase of infection followed by a redistribution of both proteins. Taken together our results provide first evidence that the early baculovirus protein IE2 associates at least with one component of mammalian PODs during virus infection, suggesting that POD-like structures can be formed in insect cells.","['Murges, D', 'Quadt, I', 'Schroer, J', 'Knebel-Morsdorf, D']","['Murges D', 'Quadt I', 'Schroer J', 'Knebel-Morsdorf D']","['Max-Planck-Institute for Neurological Research, University of Cologne, Cologne, D-50931, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Exp Cell Res,Experimental cell research,0373226,"['0 (Ac-PE38 protein, Autographa californica nucleopolyhedrovirus)', '0 (Immediate-Early Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '0 (Viral Proteins)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)', '146810-60-8 (IE2 protein, polyhedrosis virus)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Nucleus/*metabolism', 'Cricetinae', 'Gene Expression', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Immediate-Early Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Nuclear Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Nucleopolyhedroviruses/*metabolism/physiology', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'Recombination, Genetic', 'Trans-Activators/genetics/*metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins', '*Viral Proteins']",,2001/03/23 10:00,2001/06/08 10:01,['2001/03/23 10:00'],"['2001/03/23 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/06/08 10:01 [medline]', '2001/03/23 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Exp Cell Res. 2001 Apr 1;264(2):219-32. doi: 10.1006/excr.2000.5081.,,['Copyright 2001 Academic Press.'],"['10.1006/excr.2000.5081 [doi]', 'S0014-4827(00)95081-X [pii]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

CASE SUMMARY: A 72-year-old woman with acute myelomonocytic leukemia was treated with amphotericin B deoxycholate for suspected pulmonary aspergillosis; the drug was well tolerated but resulted in renal failure. Antifungal therapy was then changed to liposomal amphotericin B. Within 10 minutes of liposomal amphotericin B infusion, the patient developed severe dyspnea, chest pain, and a feeling of imminent death. On the following day, liposomal amphotericin B was switched to amphotericin B colloidal dispersion. Again, within 10 minutes of this infusion, the patient developed fever, chills, hypotension, severe chest pain, dsypnea, and a feeling of imminent death. The patient refused any further treatment with these drugs and insisted on switching back to amphotericin B deoxycholate, which was then administered for 10 days and was well tolerated. DISCUSSION: Severe adverse reactions, such as anaphylaxis, cardiac toxicity, and respiratory failure, following administration of all three lipid formulations of amphotericin B have been reported. In most reported cases, switching to a different lipid formulation of amphotericin B was well tolerated. This is in contrast to our case, where a severe reaction was repeated when another lipid preparation was given, necessitating switching back to amphotericin B deoxycholate despite its nephrotoxicity. CONCLUSIONS: In some patients, paradoxically, lipid formulations of amphotericin B may be less tolerable than conventional amphotericin B.","['Bishara, J', 'Weinberger, M', 'Lin, A Y', 'Pitlik, S']","['Bishara J', 'Weinberger M', 'Lin AY', 'Pitlik S']","['Department of Internal Medicine C, Rabin Medical Center, Sackler School of Medicine, Tel Aviv University, Petach Tikva, Israel.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",United States,Ann Pharmacother,The Annals of pharmacotherapy,9203131,"['0 (Antifungal Agents)', '0 (Colloids)', '0 (Liposomes)', '7XU7A7DROE (Amphotericin B)']",IM,"['Acute Kidney Injury/chemically induced', 'Aged', 'Amphotericin B/administration & dosage/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Antifungal Agents/administration & dosage/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Aspergillosis/complications/drug therapy', 'Colloids', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/complications', 'Liposomes']",,2001/03/23 10:00,2001/06/22 10:01,['2001/03/23 10:00'],"['2001/03/23 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/06/22 10:01 [medline]', '2001/03/23 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Ann Pharmacother. 2001 Mar;35(3):308-10. doi: 10.1345/aph.10240.,,,['10.1345/aph.10240 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

On the other hand, the specific underlying molecular lesions in myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) or leukemias with aberrations of chromosomes 5q or 7, respectively, are largely unknown. Despite extraordinary scientific effort no specific genes on chromosome 5q or 7, which act as tumor suppressors, have definitely been identified. Therefore, it has recently been speculated that the AML-1 gene, even if distantly located on chromosome 21q22, may be involved in leukemogenesis in patients with aberrations at chromosome 5q or monosomy 7 [2]. Therefore, we sequenced all exons of the AML-1 gene in 15 patients with MDS/AML and deleted chromosome 5q or 7q, respectively. None of the patients analyzed had any AML-1 mutation.","['Ferrari, T', 'Weber, B', 'Pils, S', 'Harbott, J', 'Borkhardt, A']","['Ferrari T', 'Weber B', 'Pils S', 'Harbott J', 'Borkhardt A']","[""Hematology and Oncology, Children's University Hospital Giessen, Giessen, Germany.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Ann Hematol,Annals of hematology,9107334,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 5/*genetics', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 7/*genetics', 'DNA, Neoplasm/isolation & purification', 'Female', 'Gene Deletion', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes, Tumor Suppressor/genetics', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*genetics', 'Point Mutation']",,2001/03/23 10:00,2001/05/01 10:01,['2001/03/23 10:00'],"['2001/03/23 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/05/01 10:01 [medline]', '2001/03/23 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Ann Hematol. 2001 Feb;80(2):72-3. doi: 10.1007/s002770000238.,,,['10.1007/s002770000238 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In acute leukaemia, ASTx is usually offered to patients in complete remission who lack an HLA-identical donor. The chances and risks must be weighed against a transplant from a matched, unrelated donor. ASTx are routinely performed in aggressive lymphoma. Indications for ASTx in intermediate and low grade lymphoma await results of clinical trials. In Hodgkin's disease and myeloma, ASTx are routinely performed in first or subsequent remission, and in early stages, respectively. Among solid cancers, ASTx is an established part of the therapeutic measures in germ cell tumours. Patients with breast cancer may undergo ASTx in an adjuvant setting after complete tumour resection or in a palliative setting after progression. Initial enthusiasm has switched to a more awaiting view of this indication. Severe autoimmune disorders may undergo haemolymphatic ablation from conditioning and a stem cell transplant. The scientific evaluation of this approach should employ three sequential steps: The first step should employ vigorous immunosuppression followed by ASTx; the second step should employ stem cell autografts depleted from autoreactive immune cells; the third step should employ allogeneic stem cells from normal donors.

Data were obtained from 71 randomly selected mothers and fathers of children diagnosed with leukaemia at least 3 months prior to the study. The content analysis revealed a wide diversity of parental responses including many of the defensive mechanisms described in the literature such as shock, denial, anxiety and guilt. The most difficult factors for the parents to deal with during the initial period were the psychological upset and the financial burden. Problems associated with relating to others and to the health care system were also identified. Hope, social support and the marital relationship were the most helpful resources in managing the multifaceted problems caused by the diagnosis. Forty-five per cent of the participants felt that the quality of their marital relationship was improved, whereas fewer reported that the diagnosis seriously disturbed their marriage. Spouses were found to adopt symmetrical rather than complementary ways of responding to and coping with the event.

Large cell variants of B-cell lymphoma/leukemia with a mantle cell immunophenotype (CD5+, CD23-), including but not limited to blastic MCL, prolymphocytoid MCL, blastic mantle cell leukemia, and prolymphocytic mantle cell leukemia, are not as well characterized. Although blastic MCL is known to be associated with a shorter overall survival than conventional MCL, the large cell variants of B-cell lymphoma/leukemia with a mantle cell immunophenotype have not been described as fully as conventional MCL. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of the present study was to describe the large cell variants of B-cell lymphoma/leukemia with a mantle cell immunophenotype. DESIGN: Nineteen cases of large cell variants of CD5+, CD23- B-cell lymphoma/leukemia are reviewed and described in regard to morphology, bone marrow morphological findings, Cyclin D1 immunostaining, and bcl-1 analysis. Clinical data were not available owing to the varied clinical sources of the specimens. SETTING: Tertiary-care academic institution. RESULTS: Lymph node involvement in blastic CD5+, CD23- B-cell lymphoma was diffuse (100%) with a nodular component (33%) or focal mantle zone pattern (10%). Bone marrow involvement in blastic CD5+, CD23- B-cell lymphoma was seen in only 27% of cases and was composed predominantly of small, slightly irregular lymphocytes. Cyclin D1 was demonstrated in 60% of the 15 cases analyzed and more sensitive in B5-fixed tissue. Bcl-1 (performed in 5 cases) was not detected in the 4 cases of blastic CD5+, CD23- B-cell lymphoma analyzed and was detected in the case of the prolymphocytoid MCL. Cyclin D1 was demonstrated in all 4 bcl-1 negative cases and was negative in the bcl-1 positive prolymphocytoid MCL. CONCLUSION: Careful analysis of clinical data, morphology, immunophenotype, Cyclin D1 expression, and molecular analysis are required to differentiate the unusual large cell variants of MCL from other processes.","['Dunphy, C H', 'Perkins, S L']","['Dunphy CH', 'Perkins SL']","['Department of Pathology, St Louis University School of Medicine, 1402 S.

It is population based and covers the Piedmont Region (population 4,500,000; NW Italy). This article reports on time trends in survival after a childhood cancer diagnosed during 1970-1994. PROCEDURE: During 1970-1994, 2,329 incident cases were registered at CCRP on the basis of histological and/or clinical information, excluding 30 cases reported only by death certificate. Histological or hematological diagnosis was available for 2,067 cases. Vital status was assessed through the offices of the town of residence. At the end of follow-up, 1,202 cases were alive, 1,084 dead and 43 were not traceable. Survival was measured for the major diagnostic groups using both univariate and multivariate statistics. RESULTS: The 5-yr survival rate for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) improved regularly from 24.7% in 1970-1974 to 81.1% in 1990-1994, for acute nonlymphoblastic leukemia (ANLL) from 0% to 38.1%, for non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) from 25.2% to 67.7%, for tumors of the central nervous system (CNS) (all types) from 33.4% to 75.9% and for Ewing tumor from 0% to 90%. Focusing on survival by period of diagnosis, the highest 5-year survival rate was observed for children diagnosed during 1985-1989 for medulloblastoma, neuroblastoma (NB), retinoblastoma, Wilms tumor, osteosarcoma, and rhabdomyosarcoma and for children diagnosed in 1990-1994 for the remaining sites. The trend over time was statistically significant for ALL, ANLL, NHL, CNS tumors, NB, and osteosarcoma as well as for all malignancies together. CONCLUSIONS: Population-based survival studies are useful complements to clinical studies. Survival results in the present study are similar to those presented for other European countries and the United States. For most types of neoplasm (except CNS) survival probability appears to stabilize 5-10 years after diagnosis.","['Pastore, G', 'Mosso, M L', 'Carnevale, F', 'di Montezemolo, L C', 'Forni, M', 'Madon, E', 'Ricardi, U', 'Terracini, B', 'Magnani, C']","['Pastore G', 'Mosso ML', 'Carnevale F', 'di Montezemolo LC', 'Forni M', 'Madon E', 'Ricardi U', 'Terracini B', 'Magnani C']","['Childhood Cancer Registry of Piedmont, Cancer Epidemiology Unit of the Centre for Cancer Epidemiology and Prevention-CPO Piemonte, S.

To overcome pain, certain units offer total anesthesia; others offer generic support; others offer no preparation at all. Since September, 1997, we have provided leukemic children with art therapy (AT), a nonverbal and creative modality that develops coping skills. Our goal is to prevent anxiety and fear during painful interventions as well as prolonged emotional distress. PROCEDURE: We treated 32 children aged 2-14 years. The modes of AT before, during, and after the punctures were as follows: clinical dialogue to calm children and help them cope with painful procedures; visual imagination to activate alternative thought processes and decrease the attention towards overwhelming reality and raise the peripheral sensitivity gate; medical play to clarify illness, eliminate doubts, and offer control over threatening reality; structured drawing to contain anxiety by offering a structured, predictable reality (the drawing) that was controllable by children; free drawing to allow children to externalize confusion and fears; and dramatization to help children accept and reconcile themselves to body changes. RESULTS: Children hospitalized before September, 1997, exhibited resistance and anxiety during and after painful procedures. By contrast, children provided with AT from the first hospitalization exhibited collaborative behavior. They or their parents asked for AT when the intervention had to be repeated. Parents declared themselves better able to manage the painful procedures when AT was offered. CONCLUSION: AT was shown to be a useful intervention that can prevent permanent trauma and support children and parents during intrusive interventions.","['Favara-Scacco, C', 'Smirne, G', 'Schiliro, G', 'Di Cataldo, A']","['Favara-Scacco C', 'Smirne G', 'Schiliro G', 'Di Cataldo A']","['Centro di Riferimento, Regionale di Ematologia ed Oncologia Pediatrica, University of Catania, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Controlled Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Med Pediatr Oncol,Medical and pediatric oncology,7506654,,IM,"['Adaptation, Psychological', 'Adolescent', 'Age Factors', 'Art Therapy/*methods', 'Bone Marrow Purging/adverse effects/*psychology', 'Child', 'Child, Hospitalized/psychology', 'Child, Preschool', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia/*psychology/therapy', 'Pain/etiology/*psychology', 'Pilot Projects', 'Spinal Puncture/adverse effects/*psychology']",,2001/03/22 10:00,2001/04/21 10:01,['2001/03/22 10:00'],"['2001/03/22 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/04/21 10:01 [medline]', '2001/03/22 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Med Pediatr Oncol. 2001 Apr;36(4):474-80. doi: 10.1002/mpo.1112.,,"['Copyright 2001 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",['10.1002/mpo.1112 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The aims of the current study were (1) to explore the incidence of hepatic dysfunction in a group of children (Egyptian and Saudi) with ALL under maintenance therapy, (2) to study the prevalence of hepatitis B (HBV) and/or C (HCV) infection and their contributions to chronic liver disease that might be induced by maintenance therapy. PROCEDURE: The current study included 105 children with ALL (54 Egyptian and 51 Saudi). All eligible patients had been on maintenance therapy for at least 12 months and all had serial assessments of liver function. These included determination of total bilirubin, AST, ALT, and alkaline phosphatase. Markers for HBV and HCV including HBsAg, anti-HBC, and anti-HCV and for some patients HCV RNA by PCR were studied. Percutaneous liver biopsy was performed for a group of children. RESULTS: The prevalence of hepatitis infection (HBV and/or HCV) among Egyptian children was found to be high (43/54-80%). Only five Saudi children had evidence of exposure to HBV (5/51-9.8%), P<0.0001. During the period of study, 22 Egyptian patients vs. four Saudi patients (41 vs. 7.8%, P<0.0001) experienced at least one episode of elevation of liver enzymes, three times the upper limit of normal or more. Twenty-six of the 48 patients (54%) with HBV and/or HCV infection had episodes of elevated liver enzymes, while there was no occurrence among the patients negative for HBV and HCV. In patients with HBV infection, the presence of HBsAg was strongly associated (100%) with elevated liver enzymes. Histopathologic examination of liver biopsies obtained from 35 patients revealed that all five patients negative for HBV and HCV had normal liver biopsies in spite of being under maintenance therapy. CONCLUSION: In children undergoing treatment for ALL, elevations in liver enzymes may be primarily due to hepatitis viruses. However, maintenance therapy using known hepatotoxic drugs, may have additive deleterious effects. Liver enzymes are normalized in affected patients when maintenance therapy is temporarily suspended.","['Meir, H', 'Balawi, I', 'Nayel, H', 'El Karaksy, H', 'El Haddad, A']","['Meir H', 'Balawi I', 'Nayel H', 'El Karaksy H', 'El Haddad A']","['King Abdul Aziz Hospital and Oncology Center, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",United States,Med Pediatr Oncol,Medical and pediatric oncology,7506654,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', 'E7WED276I5 (Mercaptopurine)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/adverse effects', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Chemical and Drug Induced Liver Injury', 'Child', 'Egypt/epidemiology', 'Hepatitis B, Chronic/*epidemiology', 'Hepatitis C, Chronic/*epidemiology', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Mercaptopurine/adverse effects', 'Methotrexate/adverse effects', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/*virology', 'Prospective Studies', 'Saudi Arabia/epidemiology']",,2001/03/22 10:00,2001/04/21 10:01,['2001/03/22 10:00'],"['2001/03/22 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/04/21 10:01 [medline]', '2001/03/22 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Med Pediatr Oncol. 2001 Apr;36(4):469-73. doi: 10.1002/mpo.1111.,,"['Copyright 2001 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",['10.1002/mpo.1111 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We analyzed auditory event-related potentials (ERPs)-P300 and MMN/P3a complex-to find out whether there was impaired attention orientation in asymptomatic cancer survivors, and whether these ERP methods could be used as more objective tools in detecting those survivors who might need academic testing. Previous clinical studies of P300 have focused on leukemia survivors. MMN for cancer survivors has not been reported. PROCEDURE: The subjects were survivors of childhood leukemia (n=11) and solid tumors (n=8), as well as healthy controls (n=10). The mean age was 15.5 years for survivors and 15.9 years for controls. Pure sine-wave tones (500 and 553 Hz, 100 ms) were used as stimuli in an oddball paradigm. The ERPs to frequency change were measured. MMN recordings were performed in a passive non-attended situation where the subject was watching a voiceless video cartoon. P300 was produced thereafter, but in an active attend situation, by the same auditory oddball paradigm as MMN. RESULTS: A significant difference was detected between the groups for the latency of P300 at electrodes Cz (P = 0.03) and C4 (P = 0.05). The cancer survivors had prolonged P300 latencies as an indication of prolonged short-term memory processing. The area and latency parameters of MMN did not differ significantly between the study groups, but in cancer survivors, the area and the mean amplitude of the subsequent P3a wave were diminished. The results indicate that the discrimination process was not as easy for the survivors as for the controls. However, it seems that in cancer survivors the basic mechanism starting attention shift to novel stimuli is not impaired. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that it is important to carefully evaluate the proper methods for the teaching of children who are survivors of malignancies. The auditory information may not always lead to the best possible learning results.","['Lahteenmaki, P M', 'Holopainen, I', 'Krause, C M', 'Helenius, H', 'Salmi, T T', 'Heikki, L A']","['Lahteenmaki PM', 'Holopainen I', 'Krause CM', 'Helenius H', 'Salmi TT', 'Heikki LA']","['Department of Pediatrics, University of Turku, Turku, Finland. paivi.lahteenmaki@utu.fi']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Med Pediatr Oncol,Medical and pediatric oncology,7506654,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],IM,"['Achievement', 'Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Agents/adverse effects', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cognition Disorders/diagnosis/*epidemiology/etiology', '*Event-Related Potentials, P300', '*Evoked Potentials, Auditory', 'Female', 'Finland/epidemiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/complications/therapy', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/*complications/therapy', 'Pilot Projects', 'Radiotherapy/adverse effects', 'Statistics, Nonparametric', 'Survivors/psychology/*statistics & numerical data']",,2001/03/22 10:00,2001/04/21 10:01,['2001/03/22 10:00'],"['2001/03/22 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/04/21 10:01 [medline]', '2001/03/22 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Med Pediatr Oncol. 2001 Apr;36(4):442-50. doi: 10.1002/mpo.1108.,,"['Copyright 2001 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",['10.1002/mpo.1108 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These are well-known with the use of certain drugs. This study was planned to investigate whether there was any effect of high-dose methotrexate on the hemostatic system in childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia. PROCEDURE: To evaluate the hemostatic system, we investigated coagulation screening tests (prothrombin time, activated partial thromboplastin time, and fibrinogen), coagulation inhibitors (protein C, protein S, and antithrombin III), and fibrinolytic system (fibrin degradation products and tissue plasminogen activator). These parameters were measured in 35 cycles of high dose-methotrexate (3 g/m(2)) of 20 childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia cases at baseline and on days 1 and 7 after the therapy. RESULTS: We found that high-dose methotrexate administration adversely affected both the coagulation system (prolonged prothrombin time and activated partial thromboplastin time and decreased fibrinogen levels) and coagulation inhibitors (decreased protein C, protein S, antithrombin III) on day 1 after chemotherapy compared to the baseline values. The hemostatic parameters began to improve on day 7 after chemotherapy, except for fibrin degradation products. Tissue plasminogen activator levels were not changed with the therapy. CONCLUSIONS: Coagulation cascade (prolonged prothrombin time and activated partial thromboplastin time and decreased fibrinogen) and coagulation inhibitors (decreased protein C, protein S, and antithrombin III levels) have been found to be affected by high-dose methotrexate therapy, but these transient changes did not cause clinical thromboembolic or hemorrhagic complications.","['Totan, M', 'Dagdemir, A', 'Ak, A R', 'Albayrak, D', 'Kucukoduk, S']","['Totan M', 'Dagdemir A', 'Ak AR', 'Albayrak D', 'Kucukoduk S']","['Department of Pediatric Hematology, Medical Faculty of Ondokuz, Mayis University, Samsun, Turkey.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article']",United States,Med Pediatr Oncol,Medical and pediatric oncology,7506654,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Blood Coagulation Factor Inhibitors)', '0 (Blood Coagulation Factors)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Blood Coagulation Disorders/*chemically induced', 'Blood Coagulation Factor Inhibitors/blood', 'Blood Coagulation Factors/drug effects/metabolism', 'Blood Coagulation Tests', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Hemostasis/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Methotrexate/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy']",,2001/03/22 10:00,2001/04/21 10:01,['2001/03/22 10:00'],"['2001/03/22 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/04/21 10:01 [medline]', '2001/03/22 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Med Pediatr Oncol. 2001 Apr;36(4):429-33. doi: 10.1002/mpo.1106.,,"['Copyright 2001 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",['10.1002/mpo.1106 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The workshop focused on unusual subtypes of these rare malignancies, allowing evaluation of the recently published WHO classification of neoplastic diseases of the lymphoid tissues. METHODS AND RESULTS: One-hundred and three cases were centrally immunophenotyped and hybridized for EBER1/2 of Epstein--Barr virus. All cases were reviewed by a panel of experienced haematopathologists and classified according to the new WHO classification for lymphoid neoplasms. Three cases were considered as precursor T-cell and 95 cases as peripheral T/NK-cell lymphoma/leukaemia. Although the cases represented a selected series of unusual cases, the following conclusions could be made: (i) Most lymphomas except the hepatosplenic gamma/delta T-cell lymphomas showed a rather broad morphological spectrum, with differences both between and within individual tumours. (ii) This heterogeneity was also reflected by the immunophenotype, for instance a variable expression of CD30 was found in many enteropathy type T-cell lymphomas. (iii) Exceptions in phenotype were regularly found in almost all categories, indicating that phenotype should not be the final determining factor in classification. (iv) The great majority of T-cell lymphomas expressed the alpha/beta T-cell receptor, with the exception of all but one hepatosplenic T-cell lymphomas and a few other extranodal peripheral T cell lymphomas. (v) Malignancies of precursor cells, blastic NK-cell lymphoma/leukaemia, adult T-cell lymphoma/leukaemia and most AIL-type T-cell lymphomas did not express cytotoxic molecules such as TIA1 and granzyme-B. In contrast, all five aggressive NK/T-cell lymphomas/leukaemias, a single case of large granular lymphocyte leukaemia and 40 of 47 primary extranodal lymphoma/leukaemias expressed these molecules. In hepatosplenic gamma/delta T-cell lymphoma, five of six cases showed expression of TIA1 but not of granzyme-B. (vi) Seven tumours developed after organ-transplant, four cases being EBV-positive. No distinct phenotype could be attributed to these cases. CONCLUSIONS: Most peripheral T/NK cell lymphomas could be categorized as distinct entities as described in the recently proposed WHO classification for lymphoid neoplasms.","['Kluin, P M', 'Feller, A', 'Gaulard, P', 'Jaffe, E S', 'Meijer, C J', 'Muller-Hermelink, H K', 'Pileri, S']","['Kluin PM', 'Feller A', 'Gaulard P', 'Jaffe ES', 'Meijer CJ', 'Muller-Hermelink HK', 'Pileri S']","['Department of Pathology, Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden, The Netherlands. p.m.kluin@path.azg.nl']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Congress']",England,Histopathology,Histopathology,7704136,"['0 (Epstein-Barr virus encoded RNA 1)', '0 (Epstein-Barr virus encoded RNA 2)', '0 (RNA, Viral)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunoblastic Lymphadenopathy/genetics/immunology/pathology', 'Immunochemistry', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Intestinal Neoplasms/genetics/immunology/pathology', 'Killer Cells, Natural/immunology', 'Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse/genetics/immunology/pathology', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/*classification/genetics/immunology/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'RNA, Viral/genetics', 'Skin Neoplasms/genetics/immunology/pathology', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology']",,2001/03/22 10:00,2001/06/29 10:01,['2001/03/22 10:00'],"['2001/03/22 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/06/29 10:01 [medline]', '2001/03/22 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Histopathology. 2001 Mar;38(3):250-70. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2559.2001.01058.x.,,,"['his1058 [pii]', '10.1046/j.1365-2559.2001.01058.x [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

LIF can stimulate proliferation of some tumour cell lines and IL-8 is angiogenic. Using semiquantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), we measured the expression of LIF and IL-8 mRNA in cultured normal keratinocytes (NKC) and the malignant carcinoma cells lines A431, SiHa, HeLa, and in biopsies of basal cell carcinoma (BCC), squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) and normal skin. Protein expression for LIF was assessed by immunohistochemistry in the biopsies. LIF mRNA expression was increased significantly (P < 0.01) in all carcinoma lines, except SiHa, compared with NKC but the IL-8 mRNA expression in carcinoma cell lines was similar to that in NKC. Expression of LIF mRNA was elevated in BCC and SCC compared with normal skin, but a significant difference was observed only between SCC and normal skin (P < 0.01). Both BCC and SCC showed significantly greater expression of IL-8 compared with normal skin (P < 0.01). There was no correlation between LIF and IL-8 mRNA expression either in BCCs or in SCCs. Immunoreactivity for LIF was absent throughout BCC and SCC, however, normal epidermis surrounding the tumour stained positive, as in normal skin. These data may suggest a role for LIF and IL-8 in the development of skin carcinomas, but without co-ordinate regulation of these two cytokines in this process.","['Szepietowski, J C', 'Walker, C', 'McKenna, D B', 'Hunter, J A', 'McKenzie, R C']","['Szepietowski JC', 'Walker C', 'McKenna DB', 'Hunter JA', 'McKenzie RC']","['Department of Dermatology, University of Medicine, Wroclaw, Poland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Clin Exp Dermatol,Clinical and experimental dermatology,7606847,"['0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Interleukin-8)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Female', 'Growth Inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', '*Interleukin-6', 'Interleukin-8/*metabolism', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Lymphokines/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Skin Neoplasms/*diagnosis', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,2001/03/22 10:00,2001/05/26 10:01,['2001/03/22 10:00'],"['2001/03/22 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/05/26 10:01 [medline]', '2001/03/22 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Clin Exp Dermatol. 2001 Jan;26(1):72-8. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2230.2001.00765.x.,,,"['ced765 [pii]', '10.1046/j.1365-2230.2001.00765.x [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Non-ablative conditioning had been given in 9 of these 10 cases, including two with haemolysis. Cyclosporin alone was used as prophylaxis against graft-vs.-host disease (GVHD). Catastrophic haemolysis of 78% of the circulating red cell mass led to anoxic death in the first case seen, but severe consequences were avoided by early, vigorous donor-compatible red cell transfusions in the subsequent two cases. Haemolysis began 7-11 d after PBSC infusion and all patients with haemolysis had a positive direct antiglobulin test (DAT), with eluate reactivity against the relevant recipient antigen. However, neither the intensity of the DAT, the donor isohaemagglutinin titre, nor other factors could reliably be used to predict the occurrence of haemolysis.

We investigated single H & RS cells from five different HD patients for point mutations at the genomic level using multiplex polymerase chain reaction amplification and subsequent sequencing. No point mutations were detected in 50 single H & RS cells analysed. Hence, accumulation of p53 protein cannot be explained by mutations within the gene. A genome-wide screening for genomic imbalances using comparative genomic hybridization revealed gain on chromosome 12q14, i.e. the mapping position of the MDM2 gene in several HD cases. Therefore, we assessed the copy number of the MDM2 gene using fluorescence in situ hybridization. In four out of six HD cases analysed, the copy number of the MDM2 gene was found to be increased. As gene amplification is frequently associated with protein overexpression, the observed accumulation of p53 in the nuclei of H & RS cells could be as a result of elevated MDM2 protein levels resulting in stabilization of p53 protein.","['Kupper, M', 'Joos, S', 'von Bonin, F', 'Daus, H', 'Pfreundschuh, M', 'Lichter, P', 'Trumper, L']","['Kupper M', 'Joos S', 'von Bonin F', 'Daus H', 'Pfreundschuh M', 'Lichter P', 'Trumper L']","['Department of Internal Medicine I, University of Saarland, D-66421 Homburg/Saar, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (MDM2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-mdm2)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Cytogenetic Analysis', 'Female', '*Gene Amplification', '*Genes, p53', 'Hodgkin Disease/*genetics', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Nuclear Proteins', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-mdm2', 'Reed-Sternberg Cells/*metabolism']",,2001/03/22 10:00,2001/04/17 10:01,['2001/03/22 10:00'],"['2001/03/22 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/04/17 10:01 [medline]', '2001/03/22 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2001 Mar;112(3):768-75. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2141.2001.02566.x.,,,"['bjh2566 [pii]', '10.1046/j.1365-2141.2001.02566.x [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

After hybridizing a fluorochrome-labelled probe to the cell-bound RT-PCR product, bcr-abl mRNA-positive cells were determined using image analysis. A dilution series of bcr-abl-positive BV173 into normal cells showed a good correlation between expected and actual values. In 25 CML samples, the percentage of in situ PCR-positive cells showed an excellent correlation with cytogenetic results (r = 0.94, P < 0.0001), interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) (r = 0.95, P = 0.001) and hypermetaphase FISH (r = 0.81, P < 0.001). The fluorescence intensity was higher in residual CML cells after interferon (IFN) treatment than in newly diagnosed patients (P = 0.004), and was highest in late-stage CML resistant to IFN therapy and lowest in CML blast crisis (P = 0.001). Mean fluorescence values correlated with bcr-abl protein levels, as determined by Western blot analysis (r = 0.62). Laser scanning cytometry allowing automated analysis of large numbers of cells confirmed the results. Thus, fluorescence in situ PCR provides a novel and quantitative approach for monitoring tumour load and bcr-abl transcript levels in CML.","['Pachmann, K', 'Zhao, S', 'Schenk, T', 'Kantarjian, H', 'El-Naggar, A K', 'Siciliano, M J', 'Guo, J Q', 'Arlinghaus, R B', 'Andreeff, M']","['Pachmann K', 'Zhao S', 'Schenk T', 'Kantarjian H', 'El-Naggar AK', 'Siciliano MJ', 'Guo JQ', 'Arlinghaus RB', 'Andreeff M']","['The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Department of Molecular Haematology and Therapy, 1515 Holcombe Boulevard, Houston, TX 77030, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (RNA, Messenger)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Analysis of Variance', 'Blotting, Western', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/analysis/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Image Processing, Computer-Assisted', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*genetics/therapy', 'Metaphase', 'RNA, Messenger/*analysis', 'Remission Induction', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,2001/03/22 10:00,2001/04/17 10:01,['2001/03/22 10:00'],"['2001/03/22 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/04/17 10:01 [medline]', '2001/03/22 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2001 Mar;112(3):749-59. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.2001.02510.x.,,,"['bjh2610 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1365-2141.2001.02510.x [doi]']",,"['CA16672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA4963/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA55164/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,

However, using dendritic cells (DCs) to promote T-cell immunity in vitro may nonetheless elicit potent specific anti-tumour responses for use in immunotherapy. Here, we show that DCs generated from CML patients had a typical dendritic phenotype and were able to stimulate autologous T cells. Three primed T-cell lines were studied in more detail in one patient. They were stimulated by autologous CML cells, but not by normal non-leukaemic cells from the patient's HLA-identical sibling. This was blocked by HLA-DR-specific, but not HLA-DQ- or HLA-DP-specific antibodies. CML-stimulated cytokine secretion, including interferon-gamma and granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating factor, suggested a Th1-type phenotype for these sensitized anti-leukaemic T cells. This study therefore shows that cells with a functional dendritic phenotype can be generated from the blood of CML patients and are potent inducers of T-cell responses to tumour cells. This approach allows sensitization of patients' T cells by their own particular tumour without the need to identify the exact leukaemia antigens involved, and may find application in immunotherapy of CML.","['Muller, L', 'Provenzani, C', 'Faul, C', 'Pawelec, G']","['Muller L', 'Provenzani C', 'Faul C', 'Pawelec G']","['Tubingen Ageing and Tumour Immunology Group (TATI), Section for Transplantation Immunology, University of Tubingen, Otfried-Muller Str. 10, D-72076 Tubingen, Germany. ludmilla.mueller@med.uni-tuebingen.de']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '207137-56-2 (Interleukin-4)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",IM,"['Cell Division', 'Cell Line', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Clone Cells', 'Dendritic Cells/*immunology', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy, Adoptive/*methods', 'Interferon-gamma/metabolism', 'Interleukin-4/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*immunology/therapy', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/pharmacology']",,2001/03/22 10:00,2001/04/17 10:01,['2001/03/22 10:00'],"['2001/03/22 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/04/17 10:01 [medline]', '2001/03/22 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2001 Mar;112(3):740-8. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2141.2001.02596.x.,,,"['bjh2596 [pii]', '10.1046/j.1365-2141.2001.02596.x [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Immunohistochemical and morphometric techniques were applied to identify nucleated erythroid precursor cells in the bone marrow and to quantify argyrophilic fibre density. Application of the Sokal index and another recently proposed CML score failed to distinguish three clearly defined risk groups. A borderline increase in fibre content (i.e. doubling of the normal density) and a relevant reduction of medullary erythropoiesis proved to be important predictors for survival, even in low-risk classified patients, according to both clinical scores. With regard to optimal treatment strategies, patients with manifest myelofibrosis showed no significant difference in survival rates under interferon or hydroxyurea treatment. Multivariate analysis confirmed the prognostic value of histological features. A risk model based on three variables (fibre density, erythropoietic precursors and spleen size) was constructed that enabled a distinct discrimination of risk profiles. In conclusion, the presented data provide compelling evidence that bone marrow features at diagnosis exert a significant impact on prognosis in CML. In this context, the generally clinical-based multivariate risk classification can be improved by consideration of morphological variables that are acting independently of treatment modalities.","['Kvasnicka, H M', 'Thiele, J', 'Schmitt-Graeff, A', 'Diehl, V', 'Zankovich, R', 'Niederle, N', 'Leder, L D', 'Schaefer, H E']","['Kvasnicka HM', 'Thiele J', 'Schmitt-Graeff A', 'Diehl V', 'Zankovich R', 'Niederle N', 'Leder LD', 'Schaefer HE']","['Institute of Pathology, University of Cologne, Joseph-Stelzmann-Str. 9, D-50924 Cologne, Germany. hm.kvasnicka@uni-koeln.de']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)', '0 (Interferon alpha-2)', '0 (Interferon-alpha)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', 'G1LN9045DK (Busulfan)', 'X6Q56QN5QC (Hydroxyurea)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Busulfan/therapeutic use', 'Erythroid Precursor Cells/*pathology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Hydroxyurea/therapeutic use', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/therapeutic use', 'Interferon alpha-2', 'Interferon-alpha/therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/drug therapy/mortality/*pathology', 'Male', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Primary Myelofibrosis/*pathology', 'Prognosis', 'Recombinant Proteins', 'Survival Analysis']",,2001/03/22 10:00,2001/04/17 10:01,['2001/03/22 10:00'],"['2001/03/22 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/04/17 10:01 [medline]', '2001/03/22 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2001 Mar;112(3):727-39. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2141.2001.02555.x.,,,"['bjh2555 [pii]', '10.1046/j.1365-2141.2001.02555.x [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have tested the hypothesis that the susceptibility of Bcl-XL-expressing leukaemic cells to apoptosis induced by VP16 (etoposide) can be enhanced by pharmacological downregulation of Bcl-XL in vivo. Two subcutaneous xenograft models of B-cell leukaemia-employing SEMK-2 and BV173 cell lines were established in severe combined immunodeficient/non-obese diabetic mice followed by 14 d of continuous subcutaneous administration of Bcl-XL-specific second generation oligonucleotides ISIS 16009 or ISIS 15999. Tumours were disaggregated, enabling investigation of Bcl-XL expression and apoptosis susceptibility at single-cell resolution using cytofluorimetry. Marked sequence-specific reduction of Bcl-XL was associated with sequence-specific enhancement of VP16-induced mitochondrial permeability transition, caspase-3 activation and loss of membrane asymmetry. A negative correlation between Bcl-XL expression and apoptosis susceptibility was observed, together with a positive correlation with respect to a reduced redox state. Bcl-XL downregulation reduces the threshold for VP16-induced apoptosis by potentiating mitochondrial dysfunction and its sequelae, and therefore presents a novel therapeutic strategy for reversing chemoresistance.","['Fennell, D A', 'Corbo, M V', 'Dean, N M', 'Monia, B P', 'Cotter, F E']","['Fennell DA', 'Corbo MV', 'Dean NM', 'Monia BP', 'Cotter FE']","[""Department of Experimental Haematology, St Bartholomew's and The Royal London School of Medicine & Dentistry, Turner Street, London E1 2AD, UK.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (BCL2L1 protein, human)', '0 (Bcl2l1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Oligonucleotides, Antisense)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (bcl-X Protein)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Casp3 protein, mouse)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Caspase 3', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*genetics', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Etoposide/pharmacology', 'Flow Cytometry/methods', 'Genetic Therapy/*methods', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Oligonucleotides, Antisense/*administration & dosage', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*genetics', 'Severe Combined Immunodeficiency/*drug therapy/genetics/metabolism', 'Transplantation, Heterologous', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'bcl-X Protein']",,2001/03/22 10:00,2001/04/17 10:01,['2001/03/22 10:00'],"['2001/03/22 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/04/17 10:01 [medline]', '2001/03/22 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2001 Mar;112(3):706-13. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2141.2001.02603.x.,,,"['bjh2603 [pii]', '10.1046/j.1365-2141.2001.02603.x [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Cotylenin A-induced differentiation was not affected by several inhibitors of signal transduction, suggesting that this inducer exhibits a unique mode of action.","['Yamamoto-Yamaguchi, Y', 'Yamada, K', 'Ishii, Y', 'Asahi, K I', 'Tomoyasu, S', 'Honma, Y']","['Yamamoto-Yamaguchi Y', 'Yamada K', 'Ishii Y', 'Asahi KI', 'Tomoyasu S', 'Honma Y']","['Saitama Cancer Centre Research Institute, Ina, Kita-adachi, Saitama 362-0806, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (Androstadienes)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (Diterpenes)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Flavonoids)', '0 (Indoles)', '0 (Lipopolysaccharide Receptors)', '0 (Maleimides)', '0 (Naphthalenes)', '0 (Plant Growth Regulators)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '0 (Virulence Factors, Bordetella)', '0 (cotylenin A)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)', 'I271P23G24 (calphostin C)', 'L79H6N0V6C (bisindolylmaleimide I)', 'SJE1IO5E3I (2-(2-amino-3-methoxyphenyl)-4H-1-benzopyran-4-one)', 'XVA4O219QW (Wortmannin)']",IM,"['Androstadienes/pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Biomarkers/analysis', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Diterpenes/*pharmacology', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Flavonoids/pharmacology', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Indoles/pharmacology', 'Interferon-gamma/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*immunology', 'Lipopolysaccharide Receptors/analysis', 'Maleimides/pharmacology', 'Monocytes/*drug effects/immunology', 'Naphthalenes/pharmacology', 'Plant Growth Regulators/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Tretinoin/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/pharmacology', 'U937 Cells', 'Virulence Factors, Bordetella/pharmacology', 'Wortmannin']",,2001/03/22 10:00,2001/04/17 10:01,['2001/03/22 10:00'],"['2001/03/22 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/04/17 10:01 [medline]', '2001/03/22 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2001 Mar;112(3):697-705. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2141.2001.02601.x.,,,"['bjh2601 [pii]', '10.1046/j.1365-2141.2001.02601.x [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

CD13 is expressed on the majority of leukaemic myeloblasts in acute myeloid leukaemia (AML), and on leukaemic lymphoblasts in a small percentage of acute lymphoid leukaemia cases. Thus, anti-CD13 monoclonal antibodies are used as diagnostic markers in leukaemia typing. By systematically amplifying overlapping reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) amplicons throughout the CD13 mRNA, we identified two splice variants in which exon 3 and exon 14 were lost. Fourteen healthy individuals and 34 patients with AML were screened for these splice variants. All healthy individuals, and the majority of AML patients, had both splice variants but they represented less than 10% of the total RT-PCR-amplified CD13 product. Increased expression of both truncated CD13 mRNA forms were observed in 6% of AML patients, whereas no detectable exon 3 or exon 14 splice variants could be generated in 26% and 9% of AML patients respectively. The different splicing frequencies may reflect altered processing of pre-mRNA or expansion of certain cell types for some AML patients, even though no correlation existed to blast percentage, FAB classification, surface antigens or cytogenetic characteristics. In addition, we identified an intron of 506 bp between exon 1 and exon 2 as well as two sites of single nucleotide polymorphism with a heterozygosity index of about 0.5, making them useful as genetic markers.","['Dybkaer, K', 'Kristensen, J S', 'Pedersen, F S']","['Dybkaer K', 'Kristensen JS', 'Pedersen FS']","['Department of Haematology, Aarhus University Hospital, Tage-Hansens Gade 2, DK-8000 Aarhus C, Denmark.

We studied the relationship between p16/p19ARF deletions, using fluorescence in situ hybridization, and in vitro drug resistance and prognosis in childhood T-ALL at diagnosis. The cellular drug resistance was measured with the methyl thiazol tetrazoliumbromide assay using a panel of drugs and the thymidylate synthase inhibition assay for methotrexate. There was a complete overlap of individual LC50 values of p16 gene homozygously deleted and p16 germ-line cases for most of the nine classes of drugs tested. The only difference was for dexamethasone: the p16-deleted group was more sensitive than the germ-line p16 group (P = 0.030). The homozygously deleted p16 T-ALL patients (n = 34) treated with the modern multiagent chemotherapy schemes of the Dutch Childhood Leukaemia Study Group ALL-VII/-VIII or Co-operative ALL-92/-97 protocols have a significantly lower 5-year disease-free survival (DFS) than germ-line p16 T-ALL (n = 25) (65.1 +/- 9.1% vs. 95.5 +/- 4.4%, Plog rank = 0.021). Hence, this study identifies a subpopulation of primary childhood T-ALL that appears to have an extremely high DFS.

Constitutive tyrosine phosphorylation of CrkL has previously been reported in platelets from chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) patients. This was confirmed in the present study, and shown to result in a weak constitutive association of CrkL with Cbl and a number of other unidentified tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins. There was no further increase in phosphorylation of CrkL in CML platelets in response to GPVI activation, whereas phosphorylation of Cbl and its association with CrkL were potentiated. In addition, this was accompanied by a small increase in p42/ 44 mapkinase (MAPK) activity in CML platelets. The functional consequence of the presence of constitutively phosphorylated proteins in CML platelets was investigated by measurement of aminophospholipid exposure and alpha-granule secretion. This revealed little alteration in the concentration-response curves for either in CML platelets stimulated via GPVI, although maximal levels of P-selectin were depressed. Despite the minimal effect on platelet activation in CML patients, we cannot exclude a role for CrkL or Cbl in signal transduction pathways stimulated via GPVI.","['Best, D', 'Pasquet, S', 'Littlewood, T J', 'Brunskill, S J', 'Pallister, C J', 'Watson, S P']","['Best D', 'Pasquet S', 'Littlewood TJ', 'Brunskill SJ', 'Pallister CJ', 'Watson SP']","['Department of Pharmacology, University of Oxford, Mansfield, Oxford OX1 3QT, UK. denise.best@pharm.ox.ac.uk']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (CRKL protein)', '0 (Crotalid Venoms)', '0 (Lectins, C-Type)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Protein v-cbl)', '0 (Platelet Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Retroviridae Proteins, Oncogenic)', '0 (platelet membrane glycoprotein VI)', '37206-04-5 (convulxin)', '9007-34-5 (Collagen)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1)']",IM,"['*Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing', 'Blood Platelets/drug effects/metabolism', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Collagen/*metabolism', 'Crotalid Venoms/*pharmacology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Humans', '*Lectins, C-Type', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*blood', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1/metabolism', 'Nuclear Proteins/metabolism', 'Oncogene Protein v-cbl', 'Phosphorylation', '*Platelet Activation', 'Platelet Membrane Glycoproteins/*agonists', 'Retroviridae Proteins, Oncogenic/metabolism', 'Stimulation, Chemical']",,2001/03/22 10:00,2001/04/17 10:01,['2001/03/22 10:00'],"['2001/03/22 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/04/17 10:01 [medline]', '2001/03/22 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2001 Mar;112(3):609-15. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2141.2001.02624.x.,,,"['bjh2624 [pii]', '10.1046/j.1365-2141.2001.02624.x [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

FB(1) perturbs sphingolipid synthesis by inhibiting the activity of ceramide synthase. Depending on the host, ingestion of FB(1) causes equine leukoencephalomalacia or porcine pulmonary edema. It is also carcinogenic to rats and may play a role in certain human cancers. Previous studies showed that FB(1) repressed specific isoforms of protein kinase C and cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (CDK2) activity. Conversely, FB(1) induced expression of CDK inhibitors, p21(Waf1/Cip1), p27(Kip1), and p57(Kip2) in monkey kidney cells (CV-1). Consequently, FB(1) treatment of CV-1 cells leads to cell-cycle arrest and apoptosis. The baculovirus IAP gene (inhibitor of apoptosis), which blocks tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-induced apoptosis, protects several fibroblast cell types from apoptosis, suggesting the TNF pathway is important for FB(1)-induced apoptosis. To identify genes that are induced by FB(1), we used a PCR-based subtraction approach. Eight genes that showed high similarity (> 90%) to known mammalian genes were identified. These genes included: tumor necrosis factor type 1 receptor associated protein 2 (TRAP2), human leukemia virus receptor (GLVR1), human Scaffold attachment factor A (SAF-A) also called heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein U (hnRNP-U), human protein kinase C-binding protein (RACK7), human oligosaccharyl transferase STT3 subunit, mouse WW-domain binding protein 2 (WBP2), human fibronectin, and an unknown human clone. The ability of FB(1) to alter gene expression and signal transduction pathways may be necessary for its carcinogenic and toxic effects.","['Zhang, Y', 'Jones, C', 'Dickman, M B']","['Zhang Y', 'Jones C', 'Dickman MB']","['Dept. of Plant Pathology, University of Nebraska, 68503, Lincoln, NE, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Food Chem Toxicol,Food and chemical toxicology : an international journal published for the British Industrial Biological Research Association,8207483,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Carboxylic Acids)', '0 (Carcinogens, Environmental)', '0 (Cysteine Proteinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Fumonisins)', '0 (Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins)', '0 (Mycotoxins)', '0 (Sphingolipids)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '0 (Viral Proteins)', '0 (inhibitor of apoptosis, Nucleopolyhedrovirus)', '3ZZM97XZ32 (fumonisin B1)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, CD/genetics', 'Apoptosis/drug effects/genetics', 'Base Sequence', 'Blotting, Northern', 'Carboxylic Acids/*toxicity', 'Carcinogens, Environmental/*toxicity', 'Chlorocebus aethiops', 'Cysteine Proteinase Inhibitors', '*Fumonisins', 'Gene Expression Regulation/*drug effects/genetics', 'Immunoblotting', 'Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins', 'Kidney/cytology/drug effects', 'Mycotoxins/*toxicity', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Signal Transduction/genetics', 'Sphingolipids/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/genetics/metabolism', 'Viral Proteins/drug effects/genetics']",,2001/03/22 10:00,2001/05/25 10:01,['2001/03/22 10:00'],"['2001/03/22 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/05/25 10:01 [medline]', '2001/03/22 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Food Chem Toxicol. 2001 Jan;39(1):45-53. doi: 10.1016/s0278-6915(00)00114-9.,,,"['S0278-6915(00)00114-9 [pii]', '10.1016/s0278-6915(00)00114-9 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It was used in the Gulf and Balkan wars as an armor-penetrating ammunition. In the operation Desert Storm, over 350 metric tons of DU was used, with an estimate of 3-6 million grams released in the atmosphere. Internal contamination with inhaled DU has been demonstrated by the elevated excretion of uranium isotopes in the urine of the exposed veterans 10 years after the Gulf war and causes concern because of its chemical and radiological toxicity and mutagenic and carcinogenic properties.

This has led to the pursuit of DNA methyltransferase inhibition as a drug target. 5-Aza-2'-deoxycytidine [5-aza-CdR (decitabine)], a potent inhibitor of DNA methyltransferase, is a drug currently in clinical trials for the treatment of solid tumors and leukemia. The efficacy of 5-aza-CdR may be related to the induction of methylation-silenced tumor suppressor genes, genomic hypomethylation, and/or enzyme-DNA adduct formation. Here, we test the hypothesis that 5-aza-CdR treatment is perceived as DNA damage, as assessed by the activation of the tumor suppressor p53. We show that 1) colon tumor cell lines expressing wild-type p53 are more sensitive to 5-aza-CdR mediated growth arrest and cytotoxicity; 2) the response to 5-aza-CdR treatment includes the induction and activation of wild-type but not mutant p53 protein; and 3) the induction of the downstream p53 target gene p21 is partially p53-dependent. The induction of p53 protein after 5-aza-CdR treatment did not correlate with an increase in p53 transcripts, indicating that hypomethylation at the p53 promoter does not account for the p53 response. It is relevant that 5-aza-CdR has shown the greatest promise in clinical trials for the treatment of chronic myelogenous leukemia, a malignancy in which functional p53 is often retained. Our data raise the hypothesis that p53 activation may contribute to the clinical efficacy and/or toxicity of 5-aza-CdR.","['Karpf, A R', 'Moore, B C', 'Ririe, T O', 'Jones, D A']","['Karpf AR', 'Moore BC', 'Ririe TO', 'Jones DA']","['Division of Molecular Pharmacology, Huntsman Cancer Institute, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, Utah 84112, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Mol Pharmacol,Molecular pharmacology,0035623,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (CDKN1A protein, human)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21)', '0 (Cyclins)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '776B62CQ27 (Decitabine)', 'EC 2.1.1.- (DNA Modification Methylases)', 'M801H13NRU (Azacitidine)']",IM,"['Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/pharmacology', 'Azacitidine/*analogs & derivatives/*pharmacology', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Colonic Neoplasms/*metabolism', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21', 'Cyclins/deficiency/genetics/metabolism', '*DNA Damage', 'DNA Methylation/drug effects', 'DNA Modification Methylases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Decitabine', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'G1 Phase/drug effects', 'Gene Expression Regulation/drug effects', 'HT29 Cells', 'Humans', 'Mutation', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/genetics/*metabolism']",,2001/03/22 10:00,2001/04/21 10:01,['2001/03/22 10:00'],"['2001/03/22 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/04/21 10:01 [medline]', '2001/03/22 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Mol Pharmacol. 2001 Apr;59(4):751-7.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

CNDAC was metabolized to its 5'-triphosphate and incorporated into DNA, which was associated with inhibition of DNA synthesis. After incubation of cells with [(3)H]CNDAC, metabolites were detected in 3'-->5' phosphodiester linkage and at the 3' terminus of cellular DNA. Specific enzymatic hydrolysis of DNA demonstrated that the parent nucleoside and its 2'-epimer 2'-C-cyano-2'-deoxy-2-ribo-pentofuranosylcytosine accounted for approximately 65% of the total analogs incorporated into DNA and essentially all of the drug in the 3'-->5' phosphodiester linkage. In contrast, all detectable radioactivity at 3' termini was associated with 2'-C-cyano-2',3'-didehydro-2',3'-dideoxycytidine. This de facto DNA chain-terminating nucleotide arises from an electronic characteristic and cleavage of the 3'-phosphodiester bond subsequent to the addition of a nucleotide to the incorporated CNDAC moiety by beta-elimination, a process that generates a single strand break in DNA. Investigation of the biological consequences of these actions indicated that, after incubation with cytostatic concentrations of CNDAC, cell cycle progression was delayed during S phase, but that cells arrested predominantly in the G(2) phase. This differed from the S phase-arresting actions of ara-C and gemcitabine, other deoxycytidine analogs that inhibit DNA replication but do not cause strand breaks. Thus, once incorporated into DNA, the CNDAC molecule appears to act by a dual mechanism that 1) delays the progress of further DNA replication, but 2) upon addition of a deoxynucleotide results in the conversion of the incorporated analog to a de facto DNA chain terminator at the 3' terminus of a single strand break. It is likely that DNA strand breaks trigger cell cycle arrest in G(2).","['Azuma, A', 'Huang, P', 'Matsuda, A', 'Plunkett, W']","['Azuma A', 'Huang P', 'Matsuda A', 'Plunkett W']","['Department of Experimental Therapeutics, The University of Texas M.

Because the final step of apoptosis is characterized by morphological changes in the nucleus, the death signals of the execution phase must be transmitted from the cytoplasm to the nucleus. Thus, the recognition and processing of cisplatin-induced DNA damage through""classic"" apoptosis, requires that a nuclear signal, generated at the initiation phase, be transmitted to the cytoplasm to be processed through the effector and execution phases. At the end of the execution phase, the apoptotic signal must come back to the nucleus to produce internucleosomal DNA degradation. Therefore, the induction of apoptosis from detection and subsequent processing of cisplatin-induced DNA damage seems to be a long and complex process of cell death. However, because cisplatin is a nonspecific drug and reacts not only with DNA but also with proteins,we cannot rule out the possibility that in some cases of cisplatin-induced apoptosis, an easier process of initiation, such as damage to cytoplasmic proteins, may take place (Perez, 1998). Thus, damage to proteins is worth considering as a factor contributing to cisplatin-induced apoptosis. Moreover, it is possible that cisplatin damage to proteins could induce apoptosis at the execution phase level. In fact, initiation of apoptosis at the execution phase (activation of caspases) has been previously reported for the cell killing produced by cytotoxic T lymphocytes (Golstein et al., 1991). Although apoptosis and necrosis are conceptually distinct forms of cell death with very different morphological and biochemical characteristics, these two types of demise may occur simultaneously in tissues or cell cultures exposed to the same insult (Eguchi et al., 1997, Zhan et al., 1999). In fact, both types of cell death have been found in the same population of cisplatin-treated cells (Pestell et al., 2000). Moreover, it has been hypothesized that in a tissue or cell population,apoptosis and necrosis might be two extremes of a continuum of possible types of cell demise. Individual cell death would be decided by factors such as the availability of energy and the metabolic condition of the cell (Leist et al., 1997). Thus, some cells might die as a result of an unfinished apoptotic program. In fact, in L1210 leukemic cells, cisplatin-induced cell death seems to be the result of a defective apoptotic program that lacks some morphological and biochemical characteristics attributed to apoptosis (Segal-Bendirdjian and Jacquemin-Sablon, 1995). In addition, at high doses, cisplatin could damage molecules involved in cellular energy supply (i.e., ATP) and also proteins directly or indirectly involved in the apoptotic process (i.e., p53, Bax, Bcl-2, and caspases), leading to necrotic cell death. In fact, in cisplatin-resistant keratinocytes transformed by H-ras oncogene, a high dose of cisplatin (312 microM) induces characteristic features of necrotic cell death(Perez et al., 1999). Thus, depending on the level of cellular damage induced by cisplatin, necrosis could take place either directly or as a consequence of an unfinished apoptotic program. In summary, a growing body of evidence suggests that cisplatin-induced cell death does not always come from ""classic""apoptosis. Depending on both cisplatin dose and cellular status, cisplatin may also induced cell death by a defective apoptotic program or even by necrosis. Elucidation of the conditions under which the apoptotic program induced by cisplatin as well as other antitumor drugs is totally or partially executed may have important implications for the outcome of cancer chemotherapy.","['Gonzalez, V M', 'Fuertes, M A', 'Alonso, C', 'Perez, J M']","['Gonzalez VM', 'Fuertes MA', 'Alonso C', 'Perez JM']","['Departamento de Bioquimica y Biologia Molecular, Facultad de Medicina, Universidad de Alcala, Alcala de Henares, Madrid, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,Mol Pharmacol,Molecular pharmacology,0035623,"['0 (Growth Substances)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 3.1.- (Endonucleases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'Q20Q21Q62J (Cisplatin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/drug effects/physiology', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Death/*drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Cisplatin/metabolism/*toxicity', 'DNA/drug effects/genetics/metabolism', 'DNA Damage/genetics', 'DNA Repair/drug effects', 'Endonucleases/metabolism', 'Female', 'Genes, Tumor Suppressor/genetics', 'Growth Substances/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia L1210/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Oncogenes/genetics', 'Ovarian Neoplasms/metabolism']",55,2001/03/22 10:00,2001/04/21 10:01,['2001/03/22 10:00'],"['2001/03/22 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/04/21 10:01 [medline]', '2001/03/22 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Mol Pharmacol. 2001 Apr;59(4):657-63. doi: 10.1124/mol.59.4.657.,,,['10.1124/mol.59.4.657 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PML plays a key role in multiple pathways of apoptosis and regulates cell cycle progression. The present study demonstrates that PML represses transcription by functionally and physically interacting with histone deacetylase (HDAC). Transcriptional repression mediated by PML can be inhibited by trichostatin A, a specific inhibitor of HDAC. PML coimmunoprecipitates a significant level of HDAC activity in several cell lines. PML is associated with HDAC in vivo and directly interacts with HDAC in vitro. The fusion protein PML-RARalpha encoded by the t(15;17) breakpoint interacts with HDAC poorly. PML interacts with all three isoforms of HDAC through specific domains, and its expression deacetylates histone H3 in vivo. Together, the results of our study show that PML modulates histone deacetylation and that loss of this function in APL alters chromatin remodeling and gene expression.

When tested for binding to CREB or CBP individually, this MLL fragment interacted directly with CBP, but not with CREB. In vitro binding experiments refined the minimal region of interaction to amino acids 2829 to 2883 of MLL, a potent transcriptional activation domain, and amino acids 581 to 687 of CBP (the CREB-binding or KIX domain). The transactivation activity of MLL was dependent on CBP, as either adenovirus E1A expression, which inhibits CBP activity, or alteration of MLL residues important for CBP interaction proved effective at inhibiting MLL-mediated transactivation. Single amino acid substitutions within the MLL activation domain revealed that five hydrophobic residues, potentially forming a hydrophobic face of an amphipathic helix, were critical for the interaction of MLL with CBP. Using purified components, we found that the MLL activation domain facilitated the binding of CBP to phosphorylated CREB. In contrast with paradigms in which factors compete for limiting quantities of CBP, these results reveal that two distinct transcription factor activation domains can cooperatively target the same motif on CBP.","['Ernst, P', 'Wang, J', 'Huang, M', 'Goodman, R H', 'Korsmeyer, S J']","['Ernst P', 'Wang J', 'Huang M', 'Goodman RH', 'Korsmeyer SJ']","['Department of Pathology, Harvard Medical School, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Boston, Massachusetts 02115, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,"['0 (Cyclic AMP Response Element-Binding Protein)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (KMT2A protein, human)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)', 'EC 2.3.1.48 (CREB-Binding Protein)', 'EC 2.3.1.48 (CREBBP protein, human)']",IM,"['Binding Sites/genetics', 'CREB-Binding Protein', 'Cell Nucleus/genetics/metabolism', 'Cyclic AMP Response Element-Binding Protein/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase', 'Humans', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein', 'Nuclear Proteins/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Plasmids', 'Protein Binding', '*Proto-Oncogenes', 'Saccharomyces cerevisiae', 'Trans-Activators/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', '*Transcription Factors', 'Transcriptional Activation']",,2001/03/22 10:00,2001/04/17 10:01,['2001/03/22 10:00'],"['2001/03/22 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/04/17 10:01 [medline]', '2001/03/22 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 2001 Apr;21(7):2249-58. doi: 10.1128/MCB.21.7.2249-2258.2001.,,,['10.1128/MCB.21.7.2249-2258.2001 [doi]'],PMC86859,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In certain lymphocytes and lymphocyte-related malignancies, GC inhibit proliferation and induce apoptotic cell death, which has led to their extensive use in the therapy of malignant lymphoproliferative disorders (2). Most of these effects result from regulation of gene expression via the GC receptor (GR), a ligand-activated transcription factor (3). Although hundreds of genes are regulated by GC (1), how certain biological GC effects relate to individual gene regulation remains enigmatic. To address this question with respect to GC-induced cell cycle arrest and apoptosis, we applied DNA chip technology (4, 5) to determine gene expression profiles in proliferating and G1/G0-arrested (by conditional expression of the CDK inhibitor p16/INK4a) acute lymphoblastic T cells undergoing GC-induced apoptosis. Of 7074 genes tested, 163 were found to be regulated by dexamethasone in the first 8 h in proliferating cells and 66 genes in G1/G0-arrested cells.

These agents are metabolized, in part, by S-methylation catalyzed by thiopurine methyltransferase (TPMT). The discovery nearly two decades ago that levels of TPMT activity in human tissues are controlled by a common genetic polymorphism led to one of the best examples of the potential importance of pharmacogenetics for clinical medicine. Specifically, it is now known that patients with inherited very low levels of TPMT activity are at greatly increased risk for thiopurine-induced toxicity such as myelosuppression when treated with standard doses of these drugs, while subjects with very high activity may be undertreated. Furthermore, recent reports indicate that TPMT may be the target for clinically significant drug interactions and that this common genetic polymorphism might be a risk factor for the occurrence of therapy-dependent secondary leukemia. In parallel with these clinical reports, the molecular basis for the TPMT polymorphism has been determined as a result of cloning and characterization of the human TPMT cDNA and gene. Those advances led to the description and characterization of a series of single nucleotide polymorphisms that result in low levels of enzyme activity as well as a polymorphic variable number tandem repeat within the 5'-flanking region of the TPMT gene that may ""modulate"" level of enzyme activity. As a result of these observations, the TPMT genetic polymorphism represents a model system for the way in which basic pharmacogenetic information is developed and applied to clinical medicine.","['Weinshilboum, R']",['Weinshilboum R'],"['Department of Pharmacology, Mayo Medical School/Mayo Graduate School/Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota 55905, USA. weinshilboum.richard@mayo.edu']",['eng'],"['Congress', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Drug Metab Dispos,Drug metabolism and disposition: the biological fate of chemicals,9421550,"['0 (Purines)', 'EC 2.1.1.- (Methyltransferases)', 'EC 2.1.1.67 (thiopurine methyltransferase)']",IM,"['Humans', 'Methyltransferases/*genetics', '*Pharmacogenetics', 'Polymorphism, Genetic', 'Purines/*therapeutic use']",,2001/03/22 10:00,2001/06/23 10:01,['2001/03/22 10:00'],"['2001/03/22 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/06/23 10:01 [medline]', '2001/03/22 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Drug Metab Dispos. 2001 Apr;29(4 Pt 2):601-5.,,,,,"['R01 GM 28157/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 GM 35720/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,

A few studies suggest that members of the B-cell lymphoma/leukemia-2 (bcl-2) family of protooncogenes may be important determinants. Thus, the purpose of this study was to test whether bcl-2 regulates the size of the primordial follicle pool at birth. To test this hypothesis, three lines of transgenic mice (c-kit/bcl-2 mice) were generated that overexpress human bcl-2 in an effort to reduce prenatal oocyte loss. The overexpression was targeted to the ovary and appropriate embryonic time period with the use of a 4.8-kilobase c-kit promoter. This promoter provided two to three times more expression of bcl-2 in the ovaries with minimal or no overexpression in most nongonadal tissues. On Postnatal Days 8-60, ovaries were collected from homozygous c-kit/bcl-2 and nontransgenic littermates (controls) and processed for histological evaluation of follicle numbers. All lines of c-kit/bcl-2 mice were born with significantly more primordial follicles than control mice (P < or = 0.05). By Postnatal Days 30-60, however, there were no significant differences in follicle numbers between c-kit/bcl-2 and control mice. These results indicate that bcl-2 overexpression increases the number of primordial follicles at birth, but that the surfeit of primordial follicles is not maintained in postnatal life. These data suggest that it is possible that the ovary may contain a census mechanism by which excess numbers of primordial follicles at birth are detected and removed from the ovary by adulthood.","['Flaws, J A', 'Hirshfield, A N', 'Hewitt, J A', 'Babus, J K', 'Furth, P A']","['Flaws JA', 'Hirshfield AN', 'Hewitt JA', 'Babus JK', 'Furth PA']","['Departments of Epidemiology/Preventive Medicine, University of Maryland School of Medicine, Baltimore, Maryland 21201, USA. jflaws@epi.umaryland.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Biol Reprod,Biology of reproduction,0207224,"['0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Animals, Newborn', 'Female', 'Gene Expression', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Oocytes/physiology', 'Ovarian Follicle/*physiology', 'Ovary/*physiology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/genetics/*physiology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit/genetics']",,2001/03/22 10:00,2001/05/25 10:01,['2001/03/22 10:00'],"['2001/03/22 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/05/25 10:01 [medline]', '2001/03/22 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Biol Reprod. 2001 Apr;64(4):1153-9. doi: 10.1095/biolreprod64.4.1153.,,,['10.1095/biolreprod64.4.1153 [doi]'],,"['AG13844/AG/NIA NIH HHS/United States', 'CA68033/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'HD38955/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Our recent focus has been the determination of genes regulated by this transcription factor that may be involved in transformation. Data presented here, using conditional expression of Myb in myeloid cells, show that c-Myb directly transactivates the endogenous c-myc and Bcl-2 genes, which explains at least in part how c-Myb regulates proliferation and survival. In addition, c-Myb prevents expression at the RNA level of the tumor suppressor INK4b gene. This gene encodes a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor, p15INK4b, that is normally upregulated at the mRNA level during myeloid differentiation and promotes growth arrest. The MMLs are generally characterized as differentiated monocytic tumors and possess the phenotype that is normally associated with p15INK4b expression. c-Myb inhibits expression of this gene, however, and therefore acts to promote a pathway which is abnormal in mature cells. This activity of c-Myb collaborates with its maintenance of c-myc expression to promote growth.","['Wolff, L', 'Schmidt, M', 'Koller, R', 'Haviernik, P', 'Watson, R', 'Bies, J', 'Maciag, K']","['Wolff L', 'Schmidt M', 'Koller R', 'Haviernik P', 'Watson R', 'Bies J', 'Maciag K']","['Laboratory of Cellular Oncology, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, Maryland 20892-4255, USA. lwolff@helix.nih.gov']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Blood Cells Mol Dis,"Blood cells, molecules & diseases",9509932,"['0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p15)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p16)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Cycle Proteins/genetics', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/*genetics', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p15', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p16/genetics', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Genes, bcl-2', '*Genes, myb', 'Genes, myc', 'Leukocytes/pathology', '*Tumor Suppressor Proteins']",,2001/03/22 10:00,2002/01/05 10:01,['2001/03/22 10:00'],"['2001/03/22 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/05 10:01 [medline]', '2001/03/22 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood Cells Mol Dis. 2001 Mar-Apr;27(2):483-8. doi: 10.1006/bcmd.2001.0409.,,['Copyright 2001 Academic Press.'],"['10.1006/bcmd.2001.0409 [doi]', 'S1079-9796(01)90409-7 [pii]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We analyzed the activity of the evolutionarily conserved PEST-like domain (P1 domain) for biochemical and biological activities of v-Myb in ex vivo cultures and in vivo. Deletion of the P1 domain did not affect v-Myb transcriptional activity, intracellular stability, or subcellular localization. However, it resulted in subtle yet important changes in biological activities. Although the mutant DeltaP1 v-Myb protein blocked the terminal differentiation of the monocyte/macrophage lineage as efficiently as the wild type (wt) in ex vivo cultures, it failed to induce the acute phase of monoblastic leukemia, with its fatal consequences, in vivo. Interestingly, in DeltaP1 v-myb-infected animals large numbers of monoblasts, comparable to those induced by wt v-myb, were present in the bone marrow but very few were found in the peripheral blood. The comparison of ex vivo wt- and DeltaP v-Myb bone marrow cells revealed several important features of v-Myb transformation: (i) the proliferation of transformed monoblasts is not an apparent consequence of the differentiation block with these processes being at least in part independent; (ii) the P1 domain is required for proliferation of v-Myb-mediated transformed monoblasts; (iii) the mechanism which renders transformed cells growth factor independent does not involve activation of an autocrine growth factor loop; and (iv) deletion of the P1 domain affects self-adhesion properties of v-myb-transformed monoblasts as well as their interaction with bone marrow stromal cells. These data indicate that the DeltaP1 v-myb mutant and ex vivo bone marrow cell cultures represent a valuable tool for studies on the mechanisms of leukemia formation.","['Dvorakova, M', 'Kralova, J', 'Karafiat, V', 'Bartunek, P', 'Dvorak, M']","['Dvorakova M', 'Kralova J', 'Karafiat V', 'Bartunek P', 'Dvorak M']","['Institute of Molecular Genetics, Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic, Flemingovon. 2, Prague 6, 166 37, Czech Republic.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood Cells Mol Dis,"Blood cells, molecules & diseases",9509932,,IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/*genetics', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Disease Models, Animal', '*Genes, myb', 'Leukemia/etiology/*genetics/pathology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Monocytes/pathology']",,2001/03/22 10:00,2002/01/05 10:01,['2001/03/22 10:00'],"['2001/03/22 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/05 10:01 [medline]', '2001/03/22 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood Cells Mol Dis. 2001 Mar-Apr;27(2):437-45. doi: 10.1006/bcmd.2001.0402.,,['Copyright 2001 Academic Press.'],"['10.1006/bcmd.2001.0402 [doi]', 'S1079-9796(01)90402-4 [pii]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

MATERIALS AND METHODS: The cell lines examined were: Epstein Barr virus transformed lymphoid ataxia-telangiectasia (AT) cell lines, GM00717C, homozygous, and GM00736A, heterozygous, for ATM; human pro-B lymphoblastic leukaemia, Reh; murine L5178Y lymphoma sublines, LY-R and LY-S. Assays performed following X-irradiation with doses from 0.1 to 2 Gy were: terminal deoxyribonucleotidyl transferase (TdT) assay to measure apoptotic fraction, DNA content analysis by flow cytometry to assess cell cycle distribution, trypan blue exclusion test to determine cell viability, cytochalasin block micronucleus assay to assess cytogenetic damage, and Western blotting to detect proteins from the Bcl-2 family. RESULTS: The cell lines in the study were of different but rather high radiation sensitivity, which was unrelated to their propensity to undergo apoptosis or micronucleus frequency. The expression of apoptotic regulatory proteins from the Bcl-2 family (constitutive and expressed 4 or 24 h after irradiation) was not related to radiation sensitivity. CONCLUSION: None of the simple predictive tests used in the study, alone or evaluated together was suitable for detection of radiation hypersensitivity although cells known to be hypersensitive (LY-S and GM00717C) were included in the analysis.","['Jaworska, A', 'Szumiel, I', 'De Angelis, P', 'Olsen, G', 'Reitan, J']","['Jaworska A', 'Szumiel I', 'De Angelis P', 'Olsen G', 'Reitan J']","['Department of Radiation Medicine, Norwegian Radiation Protection Authority, Oesteraas, Norway.']",['eng'],"['Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Int J Radiat Biol,International journal of radiation biology,8809243,"['0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis', 'Biomarkers', 'Cell Count', 'Cell Cycle/radiation effects', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Survival/radiation effects', 'DNA/analysis/radiation effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Radiation', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'In Situ Nick-End Labeling', 'Lymphocytes/metabolism/pathology/*radiation effects', 'Mice', 'Micronucleus Tests', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', '*Radiation Tolerance']",,2001/03/22 10:00,2001/04/06 10:01,['2001/03/22 10:00'],"['2001/03/22 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/04/06 10:01 [medline]', '2001/03/22 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Int J Radiat Biol. 2001 Mar;77(3):269-80. doi: 10.1080/09553000010019638.,,,['10.1080/09553000010019638 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In ex vivo bone marrow purging models, electroporation of ODN into cells has been associated with selective killing of human neoplastic cells while sparing hematopoietic stem cells. Prior studies used conventional electroporation methods (i.e., exponential decay) to introduce ODN into cells. Square wave electroporation allows the delivery of a more defined and regulated electrical pulse and is associated with high transfection efficiencies in a variety of systems. The current study was undertaken to determine whether square wave electroporation was more effective than exponential decay electroporation for the delivery of ODN into hematopoietic cells. Using fluorescein-tagged ODN and K562, chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) cells, higher transfection rates were observed after square wave electroporation. In addition, c-myc antisense ODN were more effective in reducing c-myc protein when introduced by square wave electroporation, as compared with introduction by exponential decay electroporation. Square wave electroporation is thus identified as the optimal method for delivering ODN into hematopoietic cells.","['Liu, Y', 'Bergan, R']","['Liu Y', 'Bergan R']","['Department of Medicine, Northwestern University Medical School, and the Lurie Cancer Center of Northwestern University, Chicago, IL 60611-3008, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Antisense Nucleic Acid Drug Dev,Antisense & nucleic acid drug development,9606142,"['0 (Fluorescent Dyes)', '0 (Oligodeoxyribonucleotides, Antisense)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc)', 'I223NX31W9 (Fluorescein-5-isothiocyanate)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Bone Marrow Cells/metabolism', 'Cell Survival', 'Electroporation/*methods', 'Fluorescein-5-isothiocyanate', 'Fluorescent Dyes', 'Genes, myc', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Oligodeoxyribonucleotides, Antisense/*administration & dosage/genetics/pharmacokinetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'Subcellular Fractions/metabolism', 'Transfection']",,2001/03/22 10:00,2001/06/29 10:01,['2001/03/22 10:00'],"['2001/03/22 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/06/29 10:01 [medline]', '2001/03/22 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Antisense Nucleic Acid Drug Dev. 2001 Feb;11(1):7-14. doi: 10.1089/108729001750072083.,,,['10.1089/108729001750072083 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The probability of remaining in CR at 3 years was 82% in CML patients in the chronic phase, but 0% in those with CML in the acute phase, 7% in those with AML, 0% with ALL, and 33% with MDS. Acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) (> or = 2) developed in 31 of 89 (34%) patients with human leukocyte antigen identical related donors and was fatal for 7 (7%). A leukocyte dose of 1 x 10(7)/kg of recipient body weight with CML in the chronic phase, 3 x 10(7)/kg of recipient body weight with MDS, and 1 x 10(8)/kg of recipient body weight with acute leukemia appeared to be optimal as an initial dose of DLI. However, the minimal dose of leukocyte developing fatal GVHD was 7 x 10(7)/kg of recipient body weight. These suggest that a relatively small dose of DLI ranging from 1 x 10(7)/kg to 5 x 10(7)/kg of recipient body weight should be administered initially then the infused escalating dose 2 or 3 months later in patients with CML in the chronic phase and MDS.

We report here our experience with this procedure and demonstrate rapid engraftment to reduce procedure-related complications and enhanced allogeneic immune reaction to reduce leukemic relapse. METHODS: The feasibility of PBSCT was reviewed retrospectively. Four patients (2 AML and 2 ALL, aged 8-18 years) underwent allogeneic PBSCT for relapsed leukemia after primary allogeneic BMT (n = 2), for active hepatosplenic fungal abscess (n = 1) or for refractory relapse with conventional chemotherapy (n = 1). Four healthy donors (aged 10-49 years) received granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) 10 microg/kg/day by subcutaneous injection for 5 days. An individualized cytoreductive regimen was used before transplantation. RESULTS: No significant toxicities were observed in normal donors on G-CSF treatment or at collection of PBSC. After PBSCT, no significant acute toxicities were observed and the median duration to an absolute granulocyte count of 0.5 x 10(9)/l and a platelet count of 20 x 10(9)/l was 16 and 21 days, respectively. Although none of our patients developed acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), two developed chronic GVHD involving the liver and skin. Among those who developed chronic GVHD, one died of recurrent disease and another died of pneumonia 235 days after PBSCT. The two remaining patients have been alive without evidence of disease with follow-ups of 193 and 123 days, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Allogeneic PBSCT can be a safe procedure in a pediatric population with fewer acute complications, although the potential risk of G-CSF treatment in normal donors should be seriously weighed against the existing risks of marrow aspiration under general anesthesia. The risk of chronic GVHD may need to be balanced against a possible graft-versus-leukemia benefit in patients at higher risk of leukemic relapse.","['Matsubara, H', 'Makimoto, A', 'Takayama, J', 'Higa, T', 'Saito, T', 'Kanda, Y', 'Tanosaki, R', 'Mineishi, S', 'Ohira, M', 'Takaue, Y']","['Matsubara H', 'Makimoto A', 'Takayama J', 'Higa T', 'Saito T', 'Kanda Y', 'Tanosaki R', 'Mineishi S', 'Ohira M', 'Takaue Y']","['Pediatric Oncology Division, National Cancer Center Hospital, Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",England,Jpn J Clin Oncol,Japanese journal of clinical oncology,0313225,['0 (HLA Antigens)'],IM,"['Adolescent', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation/immunology', 'Child', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Female', 'Graft Survival', 'Graft vs Host Disease', 'Graft vs Leukemia Effect/immunology', 'HLA Antigens/immunology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Mobilization', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/immunology/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/immunology/*therapy', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Treatment Outcome']",,2001/03/21 10:00,2001/03/27 10:01,['2001/03/21 10:00'],"['2001/03/21 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/27 10:01 [medline]', '2001/03/21 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Jpn J Clin Oncol. 2001 Jan;31(1):30-4. doi: 10.1093/jjco/hye001.,,,['10.1093/jjco/hye001 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Nevertheless, the pharmacological pathways of costunolide are still unknown. In this study, we investigate the effects of costunolide on the induction of apoptosis in HL-60 human leukemia cells and its putative pathways of action. Using apoptosis analysis, measurement of reactive oxygen species (ROS), and assessment of mitochondrial membrane potentials, we show that costunolide is a potent inducer of apoptosis, and facilitates its activity via ROS generation, thereby inducing mitochondrial permeability transition (MPT) and cytochrome c release to the cytosol. ROS production, mitochondrial alteration, and subsequent apoptotic cell death in costunolide-treated cells were blocked by the antioxidant N-acetylcystein (NAC). Cyclosporin A, a permeability transition inhibitor, also inhibited mitochondrial permeability transition and apoptosis. Our data indicate that costunolide induces the ROS-mediated mitochondrial permeability transition and resultant cytochrome c release.

This indicates that mast cell-nerve communication is bi-directional. Confocal fluorescence microscopic images indicated that [Ca2+]i in neurites increased after an increase of [Ca2+]i in mast cells. The lag-time of neurite activation was several times longer than that of mast cell activation. The correlation coefficient between the lag-times for mast cell and nerve activation was calculated to be 0.81. In addition, the fluorescence images showed that calcium signals in SCG neurites were able to extend to a long distance (100-200 microm) from the site where mast cells (RBL) attached to neurites.","['Suzuki, R', 'Furuno, T', 'Teshima, R', 'Nakanishi, M']","['Suzuki R', 'Furuno T', 'Teshima R', 'Nakanishi M']","['Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Nagoya City University, Nagoya, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Japan,Biol Pharm Bull,Biological & pharmaceutical bulletin,9311984,"['0 (Receptors, IgE)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Animals, Newborn', 'Calcium/metabolism', 'Cell Communication/*physiology', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Mast Cells/metabolism/*physiology/ultrastructure', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred CBA', 'Microscopy, Confocal', 'Neurites/physiology', 'Neurons/metabolism/*physiology/ultrastructure', 'Receptors, IgE/physiology', 'Superior Cervical Ganglion/cytology']",,2001/03/21 10:00,2001/06/29 10:01,['2001/03/21 10:00'],"['2001/03/21 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/06/29 10:01 [medline]', '2001/03/21 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Biol Pharm Bull. 2001 Mar;24(3):291-4. doi: 10.1248/bpb.24.291.,,,['10.1248/bpb.24.291 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Bone marrow slides from 26 children with leukemia (18 acute lymphoblastic leukemia [ALL] and 8 acute myeloid leukemia [AML]) and 4 children with neuroblastoma were studied. Exons 20, 21, and 22 were amplified using the polymerase chain reaction technique. Single strand conformational polymorphism (SSCP) and heterodoublex analysis were performed to detect mutations. In ALL cases, two samples in exon 20 (11.11%), one in exon 21 (5.56%), and four in exon 22 (22.22%) had altered conformation. All but one of these cases were classified as high-risk leukemia patients who either relapsed or never achieved remission. Two of the AML cases who did not achieve remission and one of the neuroblastoma cases with concomitant bone marrow infiltration had altered conformation as well. The SSCP and heterodoublex analysis showed that all but one who did not belong to the high-risk group had the same altered conformation. These data suggest that Rb-1 gene could possibly be used as an independent prognostic factor for the acute leukemia of childhood and result in the intensification of chemotherapy. In solid tumors with bone marrow involvement it could play a role as a marker of aggressive disease.","['Markaki, E A', 'Tsopanomichalou, M', 'Dimitriou, H', 'Stiakaki, E', 'Perdikoyanni, C', 'Spandidos, D', 'Kalmanti, M']","['Markaki EA', 'Tsopanomichalou M', 'Dimitriou H', 'Stiakaki E', 'Perdikoyanni C', 'Spandidos D', 'Kalmanti M']","['Department of Pediatric Hematology-Oncology, and Laboratory of Clinical Virology, University Hospital of Heraklion, University of Crete, Medical School, Heraklion, Crete, Greece.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Pediatr Hematol Oncol,Pediatric hematology and oncology,8700164,['0 (Retinoblastoma Protein)'],IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Bone Marrow', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', 'Disease Progression', 'Female', 'Genes, Tumor Suppressor/genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/diagnosis/*genetics', 'Male', '*Mutation', 'Neuroblastoma/diagnosis/*genetics', 'Prognosis', 'Retinoblastoma Protein/*genetics']",,2001/03/21 10:00,2001/07/28 10:01,['2001/03/21 10:00'],"['2001/03/21 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/07/28 10:01 [medline]', '2001/03/21 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Pediatr Hematol Oncol. 2001 Mar;18(2):101-10. doi: 10.1080/088800101300002928.,,,"['10.1080/088800101300002928 [doi]', 'FEAL1F7MHRLH6KVJ [pii]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Further approaches, such as the transfer of rat/hamster/rabbit germ cells into mouse testes or cryopreservation or culture of spermatogonia, have widened the spectrum of applications associated with germ cell transplantation. Since the devastating effects of chemo- or radiotherapy on spermatogonia are the cause of infertility in oncological patients, germ cell transplantation might become an alternative approach for gonadal protection in prepubertal and postpubertal male tumour patients.

We set up and evaluated a rapid and reliable real-time reverse-transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) approach using TaqMan technology for detection and quantification of bcr-abl transcripts in CML patients at diagnosis and during therapy. DESIGN AND METHODS: A pair of primers and probe complementary to ABL exon 2 were designed, enabling detection of the most frequent bcr-abl transcripts, and also of the normal ABL-Ia transcript as an internal control. Conditions were established to amplify less than 1(-10) target molecules/reaction and detect one CML cell in 10(6) cells from healthy donors. To determine the utility of the assay, we quantified the bcr-abl/ABL-Ia ratio in 59 bone marrow samples (45 samples with evidence of different Ph+ chromosome percentages and 14 samples in complete cytogenetic remission) from 48 CML patients, 34 of them at diagnosis and 14 in clinical remission (CR). In 14 cases, this ratio was compared with results obtained by a competitive-quantitative RT-PCR/capillary electrophoresis method from contemporary specimens. RESULTS: By real-time RT-PCR, the median value of bcr-abl/ABL-Ia ratio at diagnosis was 15.334 (range 3.3-28.81) and fell to 0.9 (range 0.003-26.1) in CR. The median value of bcr-abl/ABL-Ia ratio at cytogenetic remission was 0.7 (range 0.003-2.83).

The expression of bcl-2 and Fas was then compared with that of other markers usually associated with immaturity; functional tests using the agonistic antibody anti- Fas CH11 were also carried out. DESIGN AND METHODS: The analysis was performed by flow cytometry on purified CD34+ cells in a three (CD95 PE, CD34 APC and CD71 FITC) and in a four (CD38 PE, HLA-DR PerCP, CD34 APC and bcl-2 FITC) fluorescence assay. RESULTS: The results were expressed as mean fluorescence index (MFI); bcl-2 expression was significantly higher (p < 0.001) in BM (3.73 +/- 0.63) than in MPB (2.47 +/- 0.39) and UCB (2.38 +/- 0.58); Fas was significantly less expressed (p < 0.001) in UCB (1.27 +/- 0.78) than in MBP (3.63 +/- 2.19) and BM (4.56 +/- 1.69). CD34 expression was significantly (p < 0.001) brighter in UCB compared to in MBP and BM, while CD38 and CD71 were significantly (p = 0.005 and p < 0.001, respectively) more expressed in BM than in MPB and UCB. Fas values were directly correlated to CD38; both Fas and bcl-2 were directly related to CD71 and inversely to CD34. Culture assays showed that hematopoietic precursor cells from BM, MPB and UCB had a low susceptibility to undergo Fas-mediated apoptosis. INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, bcl-2 and Fas are less expressed in UCB than in MPB and BM; early hematopoietic precursor cells are relatively resistant to CD95-triggered apoptosis; the observed correlation between Fas/bcl-2 and markers of immaturity suggests that they may be determinants of commitment in early hematopoietic precursors.","['Maurillo, L', 'Del Poeta, G', 'Venditti, A', 'Buccisano, F', 'Battaglia, A', 'Santinelli, S', 'Caravita, T', 'Epiceno, A M', 'Del Moro, B', 'Tamburini, A', 'Picardi, A', 'Suppo, G', 'Catalano, G', 'Bruno, A', 'Amadori, S']","['Maurillo L', 'Del Poeta G', 'Venditti A', 'Buccisano F', 'Battaglia A', 'Santinelli S', 'Caravita T', 'Epiceno AM', 'Del Moro B', 'Tamburini A', 'Picardi A', 'Suppo G', 'Catalano G', 'Bruno A', 'Amadori S']","['Cattedra di Ematologia, Universita Tor Vergata, Divisione di Ematologia, Ospedale S.

We studied the fate of inner-nuclear structures, splicing factor-rich foci and Cajal (coiled) bodies in differentiating hemopoietic, testis and skin tissues. Using antibodies to the splicing factors PSF, U2AF(65) and snRNPs we find that these proteins localize in foci throughout the nuclei of immature bone marrow cells. Yet, when granulocytic cells differentiate and their nuclei condense and become segmented, the staining localizes in a unique compact and thread-like structure. The splicing factor-rich foci concentrate in the interior of these nuclei while the nuclear periphery and areas of highly compact chromatin remain devoid of these molecules. Differentiated myeloid cells do not stain for p80 coilin, the marker for Cajal bodies. Immature myeloid cells contain Cajal bodies although these usually do not coloclaize with PSF-rich foci. Following complete inhibition of transcription in myeloid cells, the threaded PSF pattern becomes localized in several foci in the different lobes of mature granulocytes while in human HL-60 immature myeloid leukemia cells PSF is found in the perinucleolar compartment. Studies of other differentiating stem cell systems show that PSF staining disappears completely in differentiated, transcriptionally inactive sperm cells, is scarce as cells migrate from the inner skin layers outward and is lost as cells of the hair follicle mature. We conclude that the formation and distribution of splicing factor-rich foci in the nucleus during differentiation of various cell lineages is dependent on the levels of chromatin condensation and the differentiation status of the cell.","['Shav-Tal, Y', 'Lee, B C', 'Bar-Haim, S', 'Schori, H', 'Zipori, D']","['Shav-Tal Y', 'Lee BC', 'Bar-Haim S', 'Schori H', 'Zipori D']","['Department of Molecular Cell Biology, The Weizmann Institute of Science, Rehovot, Israel.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Cell Biochem,Journal of cellular biochemistry,8205768,"['0 (PTB-Associated Splicing Factor)', '0 (RNA-Binding Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', '*Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Nucleus/metabolism', 'Coiled Bodies/ultrastructure', 'Female', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*cytology/ultrastructure', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'PTB-Associated Splicing Factor', 'RNA Splicing', 'RNA-Binding Proteins/*metabolism', 'Transcription, Genetic']",,2001/03/20 10:00,2001/07/13 10:01,['2001/03/20 10:00'],"['2001/03/20 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/07/13 10:01 [medline]', '2001/03/20 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Cell Biochem. 2001;81(3):379-92. doi: 10.1002/1097-4644(20010601)81:3<379::aid-jcb1052>3.0.co;2-8.,,"['Copyright 2001 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']","['10.1002/1097-4644(20010601)81:3<379::AID-JCB1052>3.0.CO;2-8 [pii]', '10.1002/1097-4644(20010601)81:3<379::aid-jcb1052>3.0.co;2-8 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We previously reported that exposure to continuous 60 Hz, 1 mT magnetic fields did not significantly alter the clinical progression of LGL leukemia in young male rats following injection of spleen cells from donor leukemic rats. Results presented here extend those studies with the following objectives: (a) to replicate the previous study of continuous 60 Hz magnetic field exposures, but using fewer LGL cells in the inoculum, and (b) to determine if intermittent 60 Hz magnetic fields can alter the clinical progression of leukemia. Rats were randomly assigned to four treatment groups (18/group) as follows: (1) 1 mT (10 G) continuous field, (2) 1 mT intermittent field (off/on at 3 min intervals), (3) ambient controls ( < 0.1 microT), and (4) positive control (5 Gy whole body irradiation from cobalt-60 four days prior to initiation of exposure). All rats were injected intraperitoneally with 2.2 x 10(6) fresh, viable LGL leukemic spleen cells at the beginning of the study. The fields were activated for 20 h per day, 7 days per week, and all exposure conditions were superimposed over the natural ambient magnetic field. The rats were weighed and palpated for splenomegaly weekly. Splenomegaly developed 9-11 weeks after transplantation of the leukemia cells. Hematological evaluations were performed at 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, and 16 weeks of exposure. Peripheral blood hemoglobin concentration, red blood cells, and packed cell volume declined, and total white blood cells and LGL cells increased dramatically in all treatment groups after onset of leukemia. Although the positive control group showed different body weight curves and developed signs of leukemia earlier than other groups, differences were not detected between exposure groups and ambient controls. Furthermore, there were no overall effects of magnetic fields on splenomegaly or survival in exposed animals. In addition, no significant and/or consistent differences were detected in hematological parameters between the magnetic field exposed and the ambient control groups.","['Anderson, L E', 'Morris, J E', 'Miller, D L', 'Rafferty, C N', 'Ebi, K L', 'Sasser, L B']","['Anderson LE', 'Morris JE', 'Miller DL', 'Rafferty CN', 'Ebi KL', 'Sasser LB']","['Battelle Memorial Institute, Richland, Washington, USA. larry.anderson@pnl.gov']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Bioelectromagnetics,Bioelectromagnetics,8008281,,IM,"['Animals', 'Body Weight/radiation effects', 'Disease Progression', '*Electromagnetic Fields', 'Erythrocyte Count', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/blood/*physiopathology', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Male', 'Platelet Count', 'Rats', 'Rats, Inbred F344', 'Spleen/radiation effects', 'Splenomegaly/physiopathology', 'Time Factors']",,2001/03/20 10:00,2001/05/25 10:01,['2001/03/20 10:00'],"['2001/03/20 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/05/25 10:01 [medline]', '2001/03/20 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Bioelectromagnetics. 2001 Apr;22(3):185-93. doi: 10.1002/bem.37.,,"['Copyright 2001 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']","['10.1002/bem.37 [pii]', '10.1002/bem.37 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study identified determinants of children's exposure to magnetic fields and constructed a prediction model for them. For 632 children participating in a case-control study of childhood leukemia, we made direct measures of exposure over 48 h using a portable device, together with observations on candidate determinants. A child's age and sex, the proportion of time spent in the home, and their parents' education or income were very weak predictors of (logged) mean 48 h magnetic field (R(2) < 1%). More important were province (R(2) = 8.0%) and type of residence (R(2) = 11.3%). Low temperatures at the time of measurement were associated with high fields (about 20% increase for each 10 degrees C below 14, R(2) = 4.9%). Several visible attributes of wiring around residences predicted exposure, mostly captured in the Wertheimer-Leeper wire code (R(2) = 13.5%). Stationary 24 h measurement in the bedroom (R(2) = 63.3%) and spot measurements outside the house (R(2) = 40.7%) predicted personal exposures best. Adding other minor predictors increased only slightly variance explained by 24 h stationary (R(2) = 66.2%) and spot (R(2) = 46.8%) measurements. Without spot or stationary measurements, the best model was much less powerful (R(2) = 29.0%). We conclude that spot measurements outside the residence provide a moderately effective basis for estimating exposure for children living there, but do not perform as well as 24 h stationary measurements in the child's bedroom.

An early study showed that treatment with iodine-131 (131I)-labeled anti-CD33 mAb M195 had antileukemic effects when given as postremission therapy to patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) in second remission. This treatment, however, was limited by significant myelosuppression and by the development of neutralizing human antimouse antibodies. Treatment with native HuM195, a humanized version of murine M195, eliminated minimal residual disease detectable by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) in 50% of patients. Patients with newly diagnosed APL treated with all-trans retinoic acid followed by HuM195 and consolidation chemotherapy had an 87% 3-year disease-free survival. Radioimmunotherapy with short-ranged, high-energy alpha particle-emitting isotopes may increase the potency of native mAbs while avoiding the nonspecific cytotoxicity of beta-emitting constructs. Targeted alpha particle therapy with bismuth-213-HuM195 showed significant antileukemic activity in patients with relapsed or refractory acute myelogenous leukemia.

In the present study, we investigated the induction of AM expression due to interactions between THP-1 cells (human monocytic cell line) and human umbilical cord vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). AM levels in the culture medium were measured by radioimmunoassay. The luciferase vector containing the 5'-flanking region of the human AM gene was transfected into either HUVECs or THP-1 cells.

Luciferase vectors containing the 5'-flanking region of human AM gene (pLCF-1534) were transferred into THP-1 cells or HUVECs. Addition of THP-1 cells to pLCF-1534-transfected HUVECs induced an increase in luciferase activity in cell lysates, which was 5-fold higher than that of the transfected HUVECs alone. In contrast, the luciferase activity of lysates from pLCF-1534-transfected THP-1 cells was not affected by coculture with HUVECs. A separate coculture experiment revealed that direct contact of THP-1 cells and HUVECs contributed to enhanced AM production in the cocoulture. Co-incubation of the cell membrane fraction from THP-1 cells augmented AM production by HUVECs. Both anti-interleukin (IL)-1alpha antibody and IL-1 receptor antagonist significantly inhibited AM production in the cocultures.

The Bcr moiety in Bcr/Abl activates the Abl tyrosine kinase, an ingredient essential for the transforming capability of Bcr/Abl. Residues 1-63 of Bcr form an N-terminal oligomerization domain and are key to Abl activation in vitro. Mice transgenic for P190 BCR/ABL reproducibly develop an aggressive B-lineage lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma. Here we test the hypothesis that residues 1-63 of Bcr have a major in vivo contribution to the oncogenicity of Bcr/Abl P190 by the generation of mice transgenic for an N-terminal deleted form of P190. We find that although the transgene is expressed in the bone marrow of mice at an early age, the incidence of leukemogenesis is greatly diminished as compared to mice transgenic for non-mutated P190 Bcr/Abl.

These results demonstrate that the Bcr oligomerization domain contributes to the oncogenicity of Bcr/Abl in vivo.","['Heisterkamp, N', 'Voncken, J W', 'Senadheera, D', 'Hemmeryckx, B', 'Gonzalez-Gomez, I', 'Reichert, A', 'Pattengale, P K', 'Groffen, J']","['Heisterkamp N', 'Voncken JW', 'Senadheera D', 'Hemmeryckx B', 'Gonzalez-Gomez I', 'Reichert A', 'Pattengale PK', 'Groffen J']","['Division of Hematology/Oncology, Ms#54, Section of Molecular Carcinogenesis, Childrens Hospital of Los Angeles Research Institute, Los Angeles, CA 90027, USA. heisterk@hsc.usc.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Greece,Int J Mol Med,International journal of molecular medicine,9810955,"['0 (Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Peptide Fragments)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Bcr protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcr)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/genetics/*physiology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*genetics', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Oncogene Proteins/genetics/*physiology', 'Peptide Fragments/genetics/*physiology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary/genetics', '*Protein-Tyrosine Kinases', '*Proto-Oncogene Proteins', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcr', 'Sequence Deletion']",,2001/03/20 10:00,2001/06/23 10:01,['2001/03/20 10:00'],"['2001/03/20 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/06/23 10:01 [medline]', '2001/03/20 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Int J Mol Med. 2001 Apr;7(4):351-7. doi: 10.3892/ijmm.7.4.351.,,,['10.3892/ijmm.7.4.351 [doi]'],,['CA 50248/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the mechanisms for activation of ERK2 have not been defined yet in cells. Here, we used fluorescent protein-tagged ERK2 and MEK to examine the localization of ERK2 and MEK in living rat basophilic leukemia (RBL-2H3) cells. ERK2 was mainly in the cytoplasm in resting cells but translocated into the nucleus after the ligation of IgE receptors. The import of ERK2 reached the maximum at 6--7 min, and then the imported ERK2 was exported from the nucleus. MEK mainly resided in the cytoplasm, and no significant MEK translocation was detected statically after ligation of IgE receptors. However, analysis of the dynamics of ERK2 and MEK suggested that both of them rapidly shuttle between the cytoplasm and the nucleus and that MEK regulates the nuclear shuttling of ERK2, whereas MEK remains mainly in the cytoplasm. In addition, the data suggested that the sustained calcium increase was required for the optimal translocation of ERK2 into the nucleus in RBL-2H3 cells. These results gave a new insight of the dynamics of ERK2 and MEK in the nuclear shuttling of RBL-2H3 cells after the ligation of IgE receptors.","['Furuno, T', 'Hirashima, N', 'Onizawa, S', 'Sagiya, N', 'Nakanishi, M']","['Furuno T', 'Hirashima N', 'Onizawa S', 'Sagiya N', 'Nakanishi M']","['Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Nagoya City University, Nagoya, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Antigens)', '0 (Bacterial Proteins)', '0 (Cations, Divalent)', '0 (Dinitrophenols)', '0 (Luminescent Proteins)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (dinitrophenyl-bovine serum albumin)', '0 (yellow fluorescent protein, Bacteria)', '147336-22-9 (Green Fluorescent Proteins)', '27432CM55Q (Serum Albumin, Bovine)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1)', 'EC 2.7.12.2 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinases)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Active Transport, Cell Nucleus/genetics/immunology', 'Animals', 'Antigens/*immunology', 'Bacterial Proteins/genetics', 'Calcium/physiology', 'Cations, Divalent/pharmacology', 'Cell Nucleus/*enzymology/genetics/metabolism', 'Dinitrophenols/immunology', 'Enzyme Activation/genetics', 'Green Fluorescent Proteins', 'Luminescent Proteins/genetics', 'Microscopy, Confocal', 'Microscopy, Fluorescence', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1/genetics/*metabolism', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinases/genetics/metabolism/*physiology', 'Rats', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/chemistry/metabolism', 'Serum Albumin, Bovine/immunology', 'Subcellular Fractions/enzymology', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/*enzymology/metabolism']",,2001/03/20 10:00,2001/06/22 10:01,['2001/03/20 10:00'],"['2001/03/20 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/06/22 10:01 [medline]', '2001/03/20 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 2001 Apr 1;166(7):4416-21. doi: 10.4049/jimmunol.166.7.4416.,,,['10.4049/jimmunol.166.7.4416 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We examined LP-BM5 murine leukemia virus-infected mice, which manifest excitotoxic brain lesions and hypergammaglobulinemia, for the presence of AMPA-receptor Ab's. Endogenous IgG accumulated upon neurons in the neocortex and caudate/putamen of infected mice and interacted with native and recombinant AMPA-receptor subunits with the following relative abundance: GluR3 > or = GluR1 > GluR2 = GluR4, as determined by immunoprecipitation. In a radioligand assay, IgG preparations from infected mice specifically inhibited [(3)H]AMPA binding to receptors in brain homogenates, an activity that was lost after preadsorbing the IgG preparation to immobilized LP-BM5 virus. These IgGs also evoked currents when applied to hippocampal pyramidal neurons or to damaged cerebellar granule neurons. These currents could be blocked using any of several AMPA receptor antagonists. Thus, anti-AMPA-receptor Ab's can be produced as the result of a virus infection, in part through molecular mimicry. These Ab's may alter neuronal signaling and contribute to the neurodegeneration observed in these mice, actions that may be curtailed by the use of AMPA-receptor antagonists.","['Koustova, E', 'Sei, Y', 'Fossom, L', 'Wei, M L', 'Usherwood, P N', 'Keele, N B', 'Rogawski, M A', 'Basile, A S']","['Koustova E', 'Sei Y', 'Fossom L', 'Wei ML', 'Usherwood PN', 'Keele NB', 'Rogawski MA', 'Basile AS']","['Laboratory of Bioorganic Chemistry, National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases/NIH, Bethesda, Maryland 20892-0008, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Clin Invest,The Journal of clinical investigation,7802877,"['0 (Autoantibodies)', '0 (Immunoglobulin G)', '0 (Receptors, AMPA)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Autoantibodies/*biosynthesis/metabolism', 'Immunoglobulin G/metabolism', '*Leukemia Virus, Murine', 'Leukemia, Experimental/complications/*immunology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Inbred DBA', 'Nerve Degeneration/etiology/immunology/prevention & control', 'Radioligand Assay', 'Receptors, AMPA/antagonists & inhibitors/*immunology', 'Retroviridae Infections/complications/*immunology', 'Signal Transduction', 'Tumor Virus Infections/complications/*immunology']",,2001/03/20 10:00,2001/04/21 10:01,['2001/03/20 10:00'],"['2001/03/20 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/04/21 10:01 [medline]', '2001/03/20 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Clin Invest. 2001 Mar;107(6):737-44. doi: 10.1172/JCI11500.,,,['10.1172/JCI11500 [doi]'],PMC208947,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To investigate the interaction of Vpr and Vpx with respect to the effects of reverse transcriptase (RT) activity, viral particle information and Vpx expression site directed mutagenesis was carried out to construct Vpr, Vpx and double Vpr/Vpx HIV-2 mutants. These mutants were used for infection of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBM), human acute lymphoblastomic leukaemia cells (CEM-CM3) and HeLa CD4+ cells. Visualization of Vpx expression was carried out using FITC and gold labelling by means of laser scanning confocal microscopy and semi quantitative immunoelectron microscopy. Intracellular and extracellular localizations of Vpx were determined by means of fine structural analysis. Up to 80-90% reduction in the RT activity, total number of viral particles, and average Vpx expression was observed after infection of target cells with the Vpr mutant strains. In addition, intracellular Vpx expression was reduced to 51.2% with the Vpr mutant. Only 0.02% Vpx expression was detected after mutation at amino acid 62.

Leukaemia variants in which the primitive blast cells are demonstrably erythroid are extremely rare and poorly characterised. Variably referred to as ""true erythroleukaemia"" or ""acute erythremic myelosis"", they are often included within the M6 AML category even though they do not meet strict criteria for this type of AML. METHODS: Two cases of acute erythroid neoplasia are presented with clinical, morphological, immunophenotypic, and cytogenetic analysis. RESULTS: Both patients presented with profound anaemia, one in a setting of long standing myelodysplasia. Bone marrow examination revealed a predominant population of highly dysplastic erythroid cells in both cases. In one case, the liver was infiltrated by neoplastic erythroid cells. Both patients died within four months of diagnosis. CONCLUSIONS: This report illustrates that cases of acute leukaemia occur in which the dominant neoplastic cell is a primitive erythroid cell without an accompanying increase in myeloblasts. This does not preclude the neoplastic clone originating in a multipotent haemopoietic stem cell, as suggested by cases arising in patients with myelodysplasia. Acute erythremic myelosis should be recognised as a distinct variant of M6 AML.","['Hasserjian, R P', 'Howard, J', 'Wood, A', 'Henry, K', 'Bain, B']","['Hasserjian RP', 'Howard J', 'Wood A', 'Henry K', 'Bain B']","['Department of Histopathology, Hammersmith Hospitals NHS Trust, London, UK. r.hasserjian@ic.ac.uk']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",England,J Clin Pathol,Journal of clinical pathology,0376601,,IM,"['Adult', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Erythroid Precursor Cells/pathology', 'Fatal Outcome', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/classification/*diagnosis/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged']",22,2001/03/17 10:00,2001/04/03 10:01,['2001/03/17 10:00'],"['2001/03/17 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/04/03 10:01 [medline]', '2001/03/17 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Clin Pathol. 2001 Mar;54(3):205-9. doi: 10.1136/jcp.54.3.205.,,,['10.1136/jcp.54.3.205 [doi]'],PMC1731380,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although the extra nucleotides could be dA, dC, dG, or dT residues, the extra nucleotides on the cDNAs usually consisted of a single dT residue. Experiments performed with DNA/RNA duplexes indicated that reverse transcriptase has an associated terminal nucleotidyl transferase (TdT)-like activity, which can add nontemplated nucleotides to the 3' ends of DNA, and that reverse transcriptase was responsible for the presence of the extra nucleotides detected on the 5'-RACE cDNAs. The TdT-like activity of reverse transcription was specific for double-stranded substrates (i.e., DNA/DNA or DNA/RNA duplexes) and was active over a wide range of temperatures and enzyme concentrations. Both commercially available Moloney murine leukemia virus and avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptases contained the TdT-like activity. This work implies that 5'-RACE and primer extension assays must be used carefully in determining the terminal sequences of nucleic acids because, under standard reaction conditions, reverse transcriptase can add nontemplated nucleotides to the 3' ends of cDNAs following template-directed synthesis.","['Chen, D', 'Patton, J T']","['Chen D', 'Patton JT']","['National Institutes of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Biotechniques,BioTechniques,8306785,"['0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (RNA, Viral)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'DNA, Complementary/*biosynthesis', 'RNA, Viral/*chemistry', 'RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase/*metabolism', 'Rotavirus/*genetics', 'Temperature']",,2001/03/17 10:00,2001/06/19 10:01,['2001/03/17 10:00'],"['2001/03/17 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/06/19 10:01 [medline]', '2001/03/17 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,"Biotechniques. 2001 Mar;30(3):574-80, 582. doi: 10.2144/01303rr02.",,,['10.2144/01303rr02 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We conclude that a single injection of CD3xCD19 bispecific antibodies is capable to induce an activation of autologous T lymphocytes if simultaneous costimulatory signaling by CD28 antibodies is provided. Furthermore, our data suggest that at least in some patients lymphoma-specific T cells can be recruited by this immunotherapeutic approach toward B-cell lymphoma.","['Manzke, O', 'Tesch, H', 'Lorenzen, J', 'Diehl, V', 'Bohlen, H']","['Manzke O', 'Tesch H', 'Lorenzen J', 'Diehl V', 'Bohlen H']","['University of Cologne, Department of Internal Medicine I, Joseph-Stelzmann-Str.9, D-50925 Cologne, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Clinical Trial, Phase I', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,"['0 (Antibodies, Bispecific)', '0 (Antigens, CD19)', '0 (CD28 Antigens)', '0 (CD3 Complex)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (HLA-DR Antigens)', '0 (Immunoglobulins)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Animals', 'Antibodies, Bispecific/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Antigens, CD19/*therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis', 'CD28 Antigens/*therapeutic use', 'CD3 Complex/*therapeutic use', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Cytokines/biosynthesis', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'HLA-DR Antigens/biosynthesis', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulins/metabolism', '*Immunotherapy', 'In Situ Nick-End Labeling', 'Killer Cells, Natural/metabolism', 'Leukemia, B-Cell/therapy', 'Lymph Nodes/cytology/metabolism', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/*immunology/*therapy', 'Lymphoma, Follicular/therapy', 'Lymphoma, Mantle-Cell/therapy', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Middle Aged', 'Models, Biological', 'Phenotype', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology/metabolism', 'Time Factors', 'Tomography, X-Ray Computed', 'Up-Regulation']",,2001/03/17 10:00,2001/04/17 10:01,['2001/03/17 10:00'],"['2001/03/17 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/04/17 10:01 [medline]', '2001/03/17 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Int J Cancer. 2001 Feb 15;91(4):516-22. doi: 10.1002/1097-0215(200002)9999:9999<::aid-ijc1069>3.0.co;2-a.,,"['Copyright 2001 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']","['10.1002/1097-0215(200002)9999:9999<::AID-IJC1069>3.0.CO;2-A [pii]', '10.1002/1097-0215(200002)9999:9999<::aid-ijc1069>3.0.co;2-a [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I. Clinical phase I evaluation.,508-15,"We describe the first clinical application of T-cell-recruiting bispecific antibodies directly into the tumor without the need to preactivate the effector cells. In a Phase I clinical trial, 10 patients with low-grade B-cell lymphoma were treated by a single locoregional injection of CD3xCD19 bispecific antibodies. Costimulatory signaling, which is required for the optimal activation of resting T cells, was provided by the simultaneous administration of CD28 antibodies. Equal amounts of both antibodies were injected together at 4 different dose levels (30 microg: 3 patients; 270 microg: 3 patients; 810 microg: 3 patients; 1,600 microg: 1 patient). The injection was well tolerated with mild to moderate adverse effects (2/10 patients) consisting of erythema and fever at the third dose level. The maximum tolerated dose was not reached at 810 microg of injected antibodies. Three patients showed a serum peak of TNFalpha on day 2 or 3 after the antibody application, reflecting rather an activation of CD4-positive T cells than an FcR-mediated effect. Five patients developed anti-mouse antibodies after injection of the murine immunoglobulins. Nine patients were evaluable for restaging examinations 6 weeks after the antibody application, with 2 of them (22%) showing a local clinical response. We found that a single locoregional injection of CD3xCD19+CD28 antibodies is feasible up to a dose of at least 1,600 microg of each antibody. However, the development of human anti-mouse antibodies points toward the requirement for new formats of bispecific proteins with reduced immunogenicity.","['Manzke, O', 'Tesch, H', 'Borchmann, P', 'Wolf, J', 'Lackner, K', 'Gossmann, A', 'Diehl, V', 'Bohlen, H']","['Manzke O', 'Tesch H', 'Borchmann P', 'Wolf J', 'Lackner K', 'Gossmann A', 'Diehl V', 'Bohlen H']","['University of Cologne, Department of Internal Medicine I, Joseph-Stelzmann-Str.9, D-50925 Cologne, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Clinical Trial, Phase I', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,"['0 (Antibodies, Bispecific)', '0 (Antigens, CD19)', '0 (CD28 Antigens)', '0 (CD3 Complex)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Immunoglobulins)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Animals', 'Antibodies, Bispecific/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Antigens, CD19/*therapeutic use', 'CD28 Antigens/*therapeutic use', 'CD3 Complex/*therapeutic use', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/metabolism', 'Cytokines/biosynthesis', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulins/metabolism', '*Immunotherapy', 'Leukemia, B-Cell/therapy', 'Lymph Nodes/metabolism', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/*therapy', 'Lymphoma, Follicular/therapy', 'Lymphoma, Mantle-Cell/therapy', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Middle Aged', 'Models, Biological', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology/metabolism', 'Time Factors', 'Tomography, X-Ray Computed', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/metabolism']",,2001/03/17 10:00,2001/04/17 10:01,['2001/03/17 10:00'],"['2001/03/17 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/04/17 10:01 [medline]', '2001/03/17 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Int J Cancer. 2001 Feb 15;91(4):508-15. doi: 10.1002/1097-0215(200002)9999:9999<::aid-ijc1068>3.0.co;2-d.,,"['Copyright 2001 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']","['10.1002/1097-0215(200002)9999:9999<::AID-IJC1068>3.0.CO;2-D [pii]', '10.1002/1097-0215(200002)9999:9999<::aid-ijc1068>3.0.co;2-d [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Incidence of ATL in Japan is generally higher in males compared with females, perhaps partly due to an earlier average age of infection among males. We estimated sex-specific ATL mortality among perinatally-infected HTLV-I carriers in the prospective Miyazaki Cohort Study in Japan. Based on the approximated proportion of perinatally-infected carriers, the relative risk (RR) of ATL for males compared with females was calculated. Six ATL deaths (4 males, 2 females) occurred among the 550 HTLV-I carriers in the cohort during 13 years of follow-up. The overall ATL mortality was 190.5 (95% CI 51.9-487.7) per 10(5) person-years for males and 51.7 (6.3-186.8) per 10(5) person-years for females (age-standardized RR = 3.9, p=0.02). By approximating the number of persons who acquired infection perinatally, the estimated mortality among those perinatally-infected HTLV-I carriers was 209.1 (57.0-535.2) per 10(5) person-years for males and 60.9 (7.4-219.9) per 10(5) person-years for females (age-standardized RR = 3.7, p=0.02). The adjusted RR changed minimally from the unadjusted RR, suggesting that earlier age of infection alone is unlikely the explanation for the male predominance in ATL. Based on the small number of cases available for analysis, aspects of gender itself appear to play a role in the development of this malignancy.","['Hisada, M', 'Okayama, A', 'Spiegelman, D', 'Mueller, N E', 'Stuver, S O']","['Hisada M', 'Okayama A', 'Spiegelman D', 'Mueller NE', 'Stuver SO']","['Viral Epidemiology Branch, Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics, National Cancer Institute, 6120 Executive Boulevard, EPS/8008, Rockville, MD 20852, USA. mh280i@nih.gov']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Cohort Studies', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*metabolism/*pathogenicity', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/epidemiology/*mortality/virology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Models, Statistical', 'Risk', '*Sex Factors']",,2001/03/17 10:00,2001/04/17 10:01,['2001/03/17 10:00'],"['2001/03/17 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/04/17 10:01 [medline]', '2001/03/17 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Int J Cancer. 2001 Feb 15;91(4):497-9. doi: 10.1002/1097-0215(20010215)91:4<497::aid-ijc1044>3.0.co;2-a.,,"['Copyright 2001 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']","['10.1002/1097-0215(20010215)91:4<497::AID-IJC1044>3.0.CO;2-A [pii]', '10.1002/1097-0215(20010215)91:4<497::aid-ijc1044>3.0.co;2-a [doi]']",,['5RO1-CA38450/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,

We performed a feasibility study systematically comparing large-scale gene expression profiles with clinical features in human B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL). cDNA microarrays were employed to determine the expression levels of 1,024 selected genes in 54 peripheral blood lymphocyte samples obtained from patients with B-CLL. Statistical analyses were applied to correlate the expression profiles with a number of clinical parameters including patient survival and disease staging. We were able to identify genes whose expression levels significantly correlated with patient survival and/or with clinical staging. Most of these genes code either for cell adhesion molecules (L-selectin, integrin-beta2) or for factors inducing cell adhesion molecules (IL-1beta, IL-8, EGR1), suggesting that prognosis of this disease may be related to a defect in lymphocyte trafficking.

ART reveals remarkable activity against otherwise multidrug-resistant Plasmodium falciparum and P. vivax malaria. ART has now been analyzed for its anti-cancer activity against 55 cell lines of the Developmental Therapeutics Program of the National Cancer Institute, USA. ART was most active against leukemia and colon cancer cell lines (mean GI50 values: 1.11+/-0.56 microM and 2.13+/-0.74 microM , respectively). Non-small cell lung cancer cell lines showed the highest mean GI50 value (25.62+/-14.95 microM) indicating the lowest sensitivity towards ART in this test panel. Intermediate GI50 values were obtained for melanomas, breast, ovarian, prostate, CNS, and renal cancer cell lines. Importantly, a comparison of ART's cytotoxicity with those of other standard cytostatic drugs showed that ART was active in molar ranges comparable to those of established anti-tumor drugs. Furthermore, we tested CEM leukemia sub-lines resistant to either doxorubicin, vincristine, methotrexate, or hydroxyurea which do not belong to the N.C.I. screening panel. None of these drug-resistant cell lines showed cross resistance to ART. To gain insight into the molecular mechanisms of ART's cytotoxicity, we used a panel of isogenic Saccaromyces cerevisiae strains with defined genetic mutations in DNA repair, DNA checkpoint and cell proliferation genes. A yeast strain with a defective mitosis regulating BUB3 gene showed increased ART sensitivity and another strain with a defective proliferation-regulating CLN2 gene showed increased ART resistance over the wild-type strain, wt644. None of the other DNA repair or DNA check-point deficient isogenic strains were different from the wild-type. These results and the known low toxicity of ART are clues that ART may be a promising novel candidate for cancer chemotherapy.","['Efferth, T', 'Dunstan, H', 'Sauerbrey, A', 'Miyachi, H', 'Chitambar, C R']","['Efferth T', 'Dunstan H', 'Sauerbrey A', 'Miyachi H', 'Chitambar CR']","['Virtual Campus Rhineland-Palatinate, P.O.

In recent years, evidence has emerged that the proteins encoded by these genes play pivotal roles in negative growth control, including growth suppression and apoptotic cell death. However, under what physiological condition these proteins mediate either cell cycle arrest or apoptosis, and the molecular nature of apoptotic pathways involved are currently unclear. Thus, to further explore the effects of these genes on cell growth and cell viability, either in the presence or absence of extrinsic stress, we have established M1 myeloblastic leukemia and H1299 lung carcinoma cell lines, where high level ectopic expression of MyD118, Gadd45, or CR6 can be induced by isopropyl beta-D-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG). By taking advantage of these cell lines, it was observed that in the absence of genotoxic stress, inducible expression of MyD118, Gadd45 and/or CR6 resulted in retardation of cellular proliferation and accumulation of cells in the G1 phase of the cell cycle. Ectopic expression of these proteins also was found to sensitize the cells to apoptosis induced by genotoxic agents such as UV, MMS, gamma-irradiation and VP16. Finally, evidence has been obtained that in the absence of stress, ectopic expression of MyD118/Gadd45/CR6 is insufficient to activate the MTKl/JNK/p38 stress cascade, and that enhancement of genotoxic stress induced apoptosis by these proteins may involve apoptotic pathways other than the JNK/p38 pathways.","['Zhang, W', 'Hoffman, B', 'Liebermann, D A']","['Zhang W', 'Hoffman B', 'Liebermann DA']","['Fels Institute For Cancer Research and Molecular Biology, and Department of Biochemistry, Temple University School of Medicine, Philadelphia, PA 19140, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Greece,Int J Oncol,International journal of oncology,9306042,"['0 (Antigens, Differentiation)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (GADD45 protein)', '0 (GADD45B protein, human)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Nucleic Acid Synthesis Inhibitors)', '0 (Proteins)', '367-93-1 (Isopropyl Thiogalactoside)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)']",IM,"['Antigens, Differentiation/*biosynthesis/genetics', '*Apoptosis', 'Blotting, Northern', 'Blotting, Western', 'Carrier Proteins/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Cell Cycle', 'DNA Damage', 'DNA Repair', 'Etoposide/pharmacology', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Gene Expression Regulation/drug effects', 'Genetic Vectors', 'Humans', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins', 'Isopropyl Thiogalactoside/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*metabolism/pathology', 'Lung Neoplasms/*metabolism/pathology', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/metabolism', 'Nucleic Acid Synthesis Inhibitors/pharmacology', '*Oxidative Stress', '*Protein Biosynthesis', 'Proteins/genetics', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects']",,2001/03/17 10:00,2001/06/02 10:01,['2001/03/17 10:00'],"['2001/03/17 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/06/02 10:01 [medline]', '2001/03/17 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Int J Oncol. 2001 Apr;18(4):749-57.,,,,,['1RO1CA43618/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,

We investigated the effects of UCN-01 and PMA on a panel of prostate cancer cell lines. While PMA induced p21WAF1/CIP1 and arrest growth of LNCaP cancer cells (IC50 = 0.5-1 nM), aggressive cancer cell lines (DU145, PC3, and PC3M) were resistant to PMA (IC50 >5000 nM). Low concentrations (25-50 nM) of UCN-01 abrogated PMA-induced p21 and growth arrest in LNCaP cells. These low doses of UCN-01 however did not inhibit proliferation of any prostate cancer cell line. PMA-sensitive LNCaP cells were resistant to clinically relevant concentrations of UCN-01 (IC50 = 1.2 microM), but UCN-01 inhibited growth of DU145 and PC3/3M with an IC50 of 200-400 nM. For comparison, PMA-sensitive HL60 leukemia cells were sensitive to UCN-01 due to rapid apoptosis caused by UCN-01. In PMA-resistant prostate cancer cells, UCN-01 downregulated cyclin D1, induced p21, caused morphological differentiation, and G1-phase arrest leading to slow cell death without caspase activation. Importantly, normal prostate epithelial cells (PrEC) were very sensitive to both PMA (IC50 = 0.2 nM) and UCN-01. In PrEC, UCN-01 downregulated cyclin D1 and arrest growth with an IC50 less than 100 nM. We conclude that loss of sensitivity to either UCN-01 or PMA accompanies progression of prostate cancer.","['Blagosklonny, M V', 'Dixon, S C', 'Robey, R', 'Figg, W D']","['Blagosklonny MV', 'Dixon SC', 'Robey R', 'Figg WD']","['Medicine Branch, Division of Clinical Sciences, National Cancer Institute, NIH, Bldg 10, 12N226, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA. mikhailb@box-m.nih.gov']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",Greece,Int J Oncol,International journal of oncology,9306042,"['0 (Alkaloids)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (CDKN1A protein, human)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21)', '0 (Cyclins)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Formazans)', '0 (Tetrazolium Salts)', '23305-68-2 (MTT formazan)', '7BU5H4V94A (7-hydroxystaurosporine)', 'H88EPA0A3N (Staurosporine)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Alkaloids/*pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21', 'Cyclins/*metabolism', 'DNA, Neoplasm/metabolism', 'Down-Regulation', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Formazans/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Immunoblotting', 'Male', 'Prostatic Neoplasms/*metabolism/pathology', 'Signal Transduction', 'Staurosporine/analogs & derivatives', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/*pharmacology', 'Tetrazolium Salts/metabolism', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/cytology/drug effects']",,2001/03/17 10:00,2001/06/02 10:01,['2001/03/17 10:00'],"['2001/03/17 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/06/02 10:01 [medline]', '2001/03/17 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Int J Oncol. 2001 Apr;18(4):697-704. doi: 10.3892/ijo.18.4.697.,,,['10.3892/ijo.18.4.697 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: From July 1, 1997 through December 31, 1998, 104 long-term survivors of childhood ALL or a malignant BT completed neurocognitive screening for learning impairments and concurrent problems with sustained attention. Eligibility criteria for the MPH trial included an estimated intelligence quotient greater than 50, academic achievement in the 16(th) percentile or lower for age in reading, math, or spelling, and an ability to sustain attention on a computerized version of the Conners' Continuous Performance Test (CPT) in the 16(th) percentile or lower for age and sex. Of the 104, 32 (BT, n = 25; ALL, n = 7) were eligible on the basis of these a priori criteria for a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial of MPH. The patients ingested a placebo (lactose) or MPH (0.6 mg/kg; 20 mg maximum) and repeated selected portions of the screening battery 90 minutes later. RESULTS: Compared to the 17 patients randomized to the placebo group, the 15 patients randomized to the MPH group had a significantly greater improvement on the CPT for sustained attention (errors of omission, P =.015) and overall index (P =.008) but not for errors of commission (indicative of impulsiveness) nor reaction times. A trend for greater improvement in the MPH group on a measure of verbal memory failed to reach statistical significance. No trend was observed for MPH effectiveness in improving learning of a word association task. No significant side effects from MPH were observed. CONCLUSION: MPH resulted in a statistically significant improvement on measures of attention abilities that cannot be explained by placebo or practice effects.","['Thompson, S J', 'Leigh, L', 'Christensen, R', 'Xiong, X', 'Kun, L E', 'Heideman, R L', 'Reddick, W E', 'Gajjar, A', 'Merchant, T', 'Pui, C H', 'Hudson, M M', 'Mulhern, R K']","['Thompson SJ', 'Leigh L', 'Christensen R', 'Xiong X', 'Kun LE', 'Heideman RL', 'Reddick WE', 'Gajjar A', 'Merchant T', 'Pui CH', 'Hudson MM', 'Mulhern RK']","[""Division of Neurology, Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee 38105, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,"['0 (Placebos)', '207ZZ9QZ49 (Methylphenidate)']",IM,"['Administration, Oral', 'Adolescent', 'Attention/*drug effects', 'Brain Neoplasms/complications/*psychology/therapy', 'Child', 'Cognition Disorders/*chemically induced/*drug therapy', 'Double-Blind Method', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Intelligence Tests', 'Learning Disabilities', 'Male', 'Memory/drug effects', 'Methylphenidate/*pharmacology', 'Placebos', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/complications/*psychology/therapy', 'Treatment Outcome']",,2001/03/17 10:00,2001/04/17 10:01,['2001/03/17 10:00'],"['2001/03/17 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/04/17 10:01 [medline]', '2001/03/17 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2001 Mar 15;19(6):1802-8. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2001.19.6.1802.,,,['10.1200/JCO.2001.19.6.1802 [doi]'],,"['CA20180/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA21765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients received ara-C 3 g/m(2)/d on 5 consecutive days, followed by an IV loading dose of PSC 833 (1.5 mg/kg) and an 84-hour continuous infusion escalating from 6, 9, or 10 mg/kg/d. Daunorubicin was administered as a 72-hour continuous infusion at 34 or 45 mg/m2/d [corrected]. Responding patients received consolidation chemotherapy with DNR pharmacokinetics performed without PSC-833 on day 1, and with PSC-833 on day 4. Response was correlated with expression of P-glycoprotein and lung resistance protein (LRP), and in vitro sensitization of leukemia progenitors to DNR cytotoxicity by PSC 833. RESULTS: All 43 patients are assessable for toxicity and response. Grade 3 or greater hyperbilirubinemia (70%) was the only dose-dependent toxicity. Four patients (9%) succumbed to treatment-related complications. Twenty-one patients (49%) achieved a complete remission or restored chronic phase, including 10 of 20 patients treated at the maximum-tolerated dose of 10 mg/kg/d of PSC-833 and 45 mg/m(2) of DNR. The 95% confidence interval for complete response was 33.9% to 63.7%. Administration of PSC 833 did not alter the mean area under the curve for DNR, although clearance decreased approximately two-fold (P =.04). Daunorubicinol clearance decreased 3.3-fold (P =.016). Remission rates were not effected by mdr-1 expression, but LRP overexpression was associated with chemotherapy resistance. CONCLUSION: Combined treatment with infused PSC 833 and DNR is well tolerated and has activity in patients with poor risk acute myeloid leukemia. Administration of PSC 833 delays elimination of daunorubicinol, but yields variable changes in DNR systemic exposure.","['Dorr, R', 'Karanes, C', 'Spier, C', 'Grogan, T', 'Greer, J', 'Moore, J', 'Weinberger, B', 'Schiller, G', 'Pearce, T', 'Litchman, M', 'Dalton, W', 'Roe, D', 'List, A F']","['Dorr R', 'Karanes C', 'Spier C', 'Grogan T', 'Greer J', 'Moore J', 'Weinberger B', 'Schiller G', 'Pearce T', 'Litchman M', 'Dalton W', 'Roe D', 'List AF']","['Section of Hematology/Oncology and Bone Marrow Transplantation Program, Arizona Cancer Center, Tucson 85724-5024, USA.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Clinical Trial, Phase I', 'Clinical Trial, Phase II', 'Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,"['0 (Cyclosporins)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', 'Q7ZP55KF3X (valspodar)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Area Under Curve', 'Cyclosporins/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology', 'Cytarabine/adverse effects/*pharmacokinetics/pharmacology', 'Daunorubicin/adverse effects/*pharmacokinetics/pharmacology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Interactions', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infusions, Intravenous', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Risk Factors', 'Treatment Outcome']",,2001/03/17 10:00,2001/04/17 10:01,['2001/03/17 10:00'],"['2001/03/17 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/04/17 10:01 [medline]', '2001/03/17 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2001 Mar 15;19(6):1589-99. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2001.19.6.1589.,,,['10.1200/JCO.2001.19.6.1589 [doi]'],,"['CA 17094/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 43043/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,['J Clin Oncol 2001 May 1;19(9):2583'],,,,,

Five 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors (statins), (e.g. atorvastatin, fluvastatin, lovastatin, pravastatin and simvastatin), were investigated for their ability to reverse P-glycoprotein (P-gp) mediated rhodamine 123 (R123) transport in a murine monocytic leukaemia cell line that over-expresses the multi-drug resistance protein 1a/b (mdr1a/1b). 2. P-gp modulation was studied by a fluorimetric assay and confocal microscopy by means of R123 efflux and uptake experiments, respectively. 3. Atorvastatin acid, methyl ester and lactone, lovastatin lactone and simvastatin lactone inhibited R123 transport in a concentration-dependent manner. Lovastatin acid, simvastatin acid, fluvastatin and pravastatin did not show a significant inhibition of the R123 transport in our cell system. Atorvastatin methyl ester and lactone showed the highest affinities for P-gp and results were comparable for both methods. 4. In conclusion, monitoring of R123 transport in living cells by confocal microscopy in addition to fluorimetric assay is a sensitive tool to study P-gp affinity in drug screening that is especially useful for early phases of drug development.","['Bogman, K', 'Peyer, A K', 'Torok, M', 'Kusters, E', 'Drewe, J']","['Bogman K', 'Peyer AK', 'Torok M', 'Kusters E', 'Drewe J']","['Department of Clinical Pharmacology and Toxicology, University Hospital/Kantonsspital, Basel, Switzerland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Pharmacol,British journal of pharmacology,7502536,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Heptanoic Acids)', '0 (Hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA Reductase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrroles)', 'A0JWA85V8F (Atorvastatin)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/*metabolism', 'Atorvastatin', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Interactions', 'Fluorometry', 'Heptanoic Acids/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA Reductase Inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Microscopy, Confocal', 'Pyrroles/*metabolism', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,2001/03/17 10:00,2001/07/20 10:01,['2001/03/17 10:00'],"['2001/03/17 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/07/20 10:01 [medline]', '2001/03/17 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Br J Pharmacol. 2001 Mar;132(6):1183-92. doi: 10.1038/sj.bjp.0703920.,,,['10.1038/sj.bjp.0703920 [doi]'],PMC1572659,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Clinical trials are expected to commence in early 1999 [296831]. The DISC technology utilizes a herpes virus that has had a gene removed to prevent it from replicating [250526]. Phase I trials in leukemia were scheduled to commence in 1998 [250526], however, it was decided that although DISC-Onc is capable of carrying genes into leukemic cells, the levels of immunomodulator genes did not meet the target initially set for the commencement of trials. Hence, Cantab turned its attention to other cancers, and hoped to identify an alternative target for phase I trials in the first half of 1998 [279798]. Additional preclinical work using a murine version of the lead construct produced a significant therapeutic effect in animal tumor models [289716]. DISC-Onc is envisaged to deliver immunogenic genes such as cytokine or stimulatory protein genes [275129]. Cantab, in collaboration with Nottingham Trent University and Birmingham University, has shown that the DISC-Onc has delivered genes effectively to human colorectal, gastric and ovarian cancer tumors. Transfection rates have been shown to be favorable and have been proven to be at least as good as, if not better than, other vectors [279798].

The company has reported that phase III trials will begin by the end of 2000. Preliminary studies involving 21 patients have been carried out and the results reported by the company. During these studies, seven patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia had a complete hematologic response and two patients had a partial response. Of the patients with a complete response, six had marrow and peripheral responses. Ribapharm, through a Russian subsidiary of ICN, is also planning to conduct phase II studies of tiazofurine involving patients suffering from advanced ovarian cancer or multiple myeloma which is resistant to conventional therapy.

Such novel agents may be found among chemical compounds directed against specific molecular targets (cytostatics) or within the biological substances selectively aimed at the malignant clone (immunotherapy). It is stated that the purposes of immunotherapy in general are to generate a T-lymphocytic response against the tumour cells, e.g., graft versus leukaemia (GvL) effect, natural killer T-cell cytolysis, antibody-dependent cytolysis etc.; or to reprogramme the immune system of the tumour-bearing host by DNA and/or RNA manipulation with subsequent interference with the signalling pathway in the tumour cells. Some immunotherapeutic modalities are shortly described: donor T-lymphocyte infusion and GvL effect, polyclonal antibodies, monoclonal antibodies, vaccines, gene replacement therapy, suicide gene therapy, antisense oligonucleotides, alterations of DNA-RNA transcript factors and malignant antigenic drive etc. Most likely, a sequence of different treatment modalities will be used in the future comprising an initial debulking by means of standard chemotherapy and/or irradiation followed by target unspecific immunotherapy (polyclonal immunoglobulins, GvL effect etc.) and finally target specific elimination of residual tumour, probably with repeated use of the minimum effective pharmacologic dose (MEPD) of the agents used. In contrast, the current use of high-dose myeloablative chemotherapy with the use of maximum tolerable dose (MTD) and associated severe organ toxicity, and high rates of secondary malignancies will probably be substituted in the future.

In the course of structure-activity relationship studies, we report the synthesis of two new derivatives containing an indolo[2,3-c]carbazole chromophore instead of the conventional indolo[2,3-a]carbazole unit found in the natural metabolites. The N-methylated compound 8 containing one glucose residue behaves as a typical DNA intercalating agent, as judged from circular and electric linear dichroism measurements with purified DNA. In contrast, the bis-glycosylated derivative 7 containing a glucose residue on each indole nitrogen has lost its capacity to form stable complexes with DNA. DNA relaxation experiments reveal that the two drugs 7 and 8 have weak effects on human DNA topoisomerase I. The modified conformation of the indolocarbazole chromophore is detrimental to the stabilization of topoisomerase I-DNA complexes. The lack of potent topoisomerase I inhibition leads to decreased cytotoxicity but, however, we observed that the DNA-intercalating mono-glycosyl derivative 8 is about 5 times more cytoxic than the bis-glycosyl analogue 7. The study suggests that the naturally-occurring indolo[2,3-a]carbazole skeleton should be preserved to maintain the topoisomerase I inhibitory and cytotoxic activities.","['Voldoire, A', 'Sancelme, M', 'Prudhomme, M', 'Colson, P', 'Houssier, C', 'Bailly, C', 'Leonce, S', 'Lambel, S']","['Voldoire A', 'Sancelme M', 'Prudhomme M', 'Colson P', 'Houssier C', 'Bailly C', 'Leonce S', 'Lambel S']","['Universite Blaise Pascal, Synthese, Electrosynthese et Etude de Systemes a Interet Biologique, UMR 6504, Aubiere, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Bioorg Med Chem,Bioorganic & medicinal chemistry,9413298,"['0 (Aminoglycosides)', '0 (Anti-Bacterial Agents)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Carbazoles)', '0 (Indoles)', '0 (Intercalating Agents)', '0 (Polydeoxyribonucleotides)', '0 (Topoisomerase I Inhibitors)', '0P2197HHHN (carbazole)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', '91080-16-9 (calf thymus DNA)', '93908-02-2 (rebeccamycin)', 'EC 5.99.1.2 (DNA Topoisomerases, Type I)']",IM,"['*Aminoglycosides', 'Animals', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents/chemical synthesis/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*chemical synthesis/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Carbazoles/chemistry', 'Cattle', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Circular Dichroism', 'DNA/metabolism', 'DNA Topoisomerases, Type I/metabolism', 'Glycosylation', 'Humans', '*Indoles', 'Intercalating Agents/chemical synthesis/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Leukemia/pathology', 'Mice', 'Polydeoxyribonucleotides/metabolism', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Topoisomerase I Inhibitors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects']",,2001/03/16 10:00,2001/08/10 10:01,['2001/03/16 10:00'],"['2001/03/16 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/08/10 10:01 [medline]', '2001/03/16 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Bioorg Med Chem. 2001 Feb;9(2):357-65. doi: 10.1016/s0968-0896(00)00251-0.,,,"['S0968089600002510 [pii]', '10.1016/s0968-0896(00)00251-0 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Bcl-2 analyses of bone marrow (BM) and peripheral blood (PB) samples at base-line and following therapy were performed using a PCR assay. RESULTS: In the single-agent trial, of 70 patients whose peripheral blood (PB) was bcl-2 positive at baseline, 36 became bcl-2-negative, 13 remained positive, and 21 varied between positive and negative. The overall response rates (ORRs) were 72%, 31%, and 57%, respectively. Twelve of twenty-two patients with repeat bone marrow (BM) samples were bcl-2-negative three months post-treatment.

Efforts to protect the bone marrow have been only variably successful, and no agreement exists on how to approach this problem. Melatonin, the major hormonal product of the pineal gland, is supposed to have both chemoprotective and myelostimulatory effects. This experimental study was carried out to test these two effects on the bone marrow of rats, daily intraperitoneally injected with 100 microg melatonin. Injection of 10 mg aracytin for 10 days produced a significant (P < 0.01) decrease in red blood cells count (RBCs), total leucocytic count, as well as platelets count. When melatonin was injected along with aracytin, it would significantly increase (P < 0.05) RBC count and (P < 0.01) blood platelet count. Injection of melatonin after aracytin treatment would significantly increase (P < 0.01) RBC, total leucocytic and platelet counts in comparison with rats treated with aracytin only. The effects of melatonin were more clear in rats treated with it after aracytin injection than those treated with melatonin and aracytin at the same time. Furthermore, it was found that aracytin produced a significant (P < 0.01) decrease in serum total proteins, albumin, and significantly increased the (P < 0.01) albumin/globulin ratio.

To clarify the importance of CPOX in the regulation of heme biosynthesis in erythroid cells, we established human erythroleukemia K562 cells stably expressing mouse CPOX. The CPOX cDNA-transfected cells had sevenfold higher CPOX activity than cells transfected with vector only. Expression of ferrochelatase and heme content in the transfected cells increased slightly compared with the control. When K562 cells overexpressing CPOX were treated with delta-aminolevulinic acid (ALA), most became benzidine-positive without induction of the expression of CPOX or ferrochelatase, and the heme content was about twofold higher than that in ALA-treated control cells. Increases in cellular heme concomitant with a marked induction of the expression of heme-biosynthetic enzymes, including CPOX, ferrochelatase and erythroid-specific delta-aminolevulinic acid synthase, as well as of alpha-globin synthesis, were observed when cells were treated with transforming growth factor (TGF)beta 1. These increases in the transfected cells were twice those in control cells, indicating that overexpression of CPOX enhanced induction of the differentiation of K562 cells mediated by TGF beta 1 or ALA. Conversely, the transfection of antisense oligonucleotide to human CPOX mRNA into untreated and TGF beta 1-treated K562 cells led to a decrease in heme production compared with sense oligonucleotide-transfected cells. These results suggest that CPOX plays an important role in the regulation of heme biosynthesis during erythroid differentiation.","['Taketani, S', 'Furukawa, T', 'Furuyama, K']","['Taketani S', 'Furukawa T', 'Furuyama K']","['Department of Biotechnology, Kyoto Institute of Technology, Japan. taketani@ipc.kit.ac.jp']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Eur J Biochem,European journal of biochemistry,0107600,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (Hemoglobins)', '0 (Oligonucleotides, Antisense)', '0 (Transforming Growth Factor beta)', '88755TAZ87 (Aminolevulinic Acid)', 'EC 1.3.3.3 (Coproporphyrinogen Oxidase)']",IM,"['Aminolevulinic Acid/pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Coproporphyrinogen Oxidase/genetics/*metabolism', 'DNA Primers', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'Hemoglobins/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*enzymology/metabolism/pathology', 'Mice', 'Oligonucleotides, Antisense/pharmacology', 'Transfection', 'Transforming Growth Factor beta/pharmacology']",,2001/03/15 10:00,2001/05/05 10:01,['2001/03/15 10:00'],"['2001/03/15 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/05/05 10:01 [medline]', '2001/03/15 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Eur J Biochem. 2001 Mar;268(6):1705-11.,,,['ejb2045 [pii]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, other biological activities are unknown. Herein, we have shown that WSCO is able to inhibit proliferation of human leukemia HL-60 cells and induce these cells to differentiate. Treatment with WSCO for 4 days resulted in a concentration-dependent reduction in HL-60 cell growth as measured by cell counting and MTT assay. This effect was accompanied by a marked increase in the proportion of G(0)/G(1) cells as measured by flow cytometry. WSCO also induced differentiation of the cells as measured by phorbol ester-dependent reduction of NBT, morphological changes as examined by Wright-Giemsa staining and expression of CD11b but not of CD14 as analysed by flow cytometry, indicating differentiation of HL-60 cells toward granulocyte-like cells. A combination of low dose of WSCO with all-trans retinoic acid, a differentiating agent toward granulocyte-like cells, exhibited a synergistic effect on the differentiation. In addition, treatment of HL-60 cells with WSCO for 6 or 8 days resulted in the induction of apoptosis as assayed qualitatively by agarose gel electrophoresis and quantitatively by Annexin V technique using flow cytometry. Collectively, there is a potential for WSCO in the treatment of myeloid leukemia.","['Pae, H O', 'Seo, W G', 'Kim, N Y', 'Oh, G S', 'Kim, G E', 'Kim, Y H', 'Kwak, H J', 'Yun, Y G', 'Jun, C D', 'Chung, H T']","['Pae HO', 'Seo WG', 'Kim NY', 'Oh GS', 'Kim GE', 'Kim YH', 'Kwak HJ', 'Yun YG', 'Jun CD', 'Chung HT']","['Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Wonkwang University School of Medicine, 570-749, Chonbuk, South Korea.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (water soluble chitin)', '1398-61-4 (Chitin)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', '9012-76-4 (Chitosan)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Differentiation/*drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Chitin/analogs & derivatives/*pharmacology', 'Chitosan', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Synergism', 'Granulocytes/*cytology', 'HL-60 Cells/drug effects/pathology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Tretinoin/pharmacology']",,2001/03/15 10:00,2001/05/01 10:01,['2001/03/15 10:00'],"['2001/03/15 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/05/01 10:01 [medline]', '2001/03/15 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 2001 Apr;25(4):339-46. doi: 10.1016/s0145-2126(00)00138-7.,,,"['S0145-2126(00)00138-7 [pii]', '10.1016/s0145-2126(00)00138-7 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

They play an important role in the control of the cell cycle. The human CHK2 is a homolog of the yeast G(2) checkpoint kinases known as CDS1 and RAD53. The CHK2 may be a tumor suppressor gene because it was found to be mutated in some individuals with the Li-Fraumeni syndrome. These cases had a normal, non-mutated p53 gene. We performed a mutational analysis of the CHK2 gene using polymerase chain reaction-single strand conformation polymorphism (PCR-SSCP) in 41 bone marrow samples from individuals with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and 41 samples of acute myeloid leukemias (AML). We found a novel G to C transversion resulting in a change from Ala to Gly at codon 507 of CHK2 in one MDS sample, but normal cells from this individual did not have the abnormality. In addition, we demonstrated a previously described polymorphism at codon 84 (A to G at nucleotide 252) of exon 1 of CHK2 in three of 41 MDS and three of 41 AML patients. The presence of a CHK2 mutation in MDS highlights the importance of alterations of cell cycle checkpoint genes in this disease.","['Hofmann, W K', 'Miller, C W', 'Tsukasaki, K', 'Tavor, S', 'Ikezoe, T', 'Hoelzer, D', 'Takeuchi, S', 'Koeffler, H P']","['Hofmann WK', 'Miller CW', 'Tsukasaki K', 'Tavor S', 'Ikezoe T', 'Hoelzer D', 'Takeuchi S', 'Koeffler HP']","['Division of Hematology/Oncology, Cedars-Sinai Research Institute, UCLA School of Medicine, 8700 Beverly Boulevard, Suite B213, Los Angeles, CA 90048, USA. w.k.hofmann@em.uni-frankfurt.de']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,"['EC 2.7.- (Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.1.11 (Checkpoint Kinase 2)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (CHEK2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Amino Acid Substitution', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Checkpoint Kinase 2', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', 'Female', 'Genes, cdc', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/etiology/*genetics', 'Male', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/etiology/*genetics', 'Point Mutation', 'Polymorphism, Genetic', 'Protein Kinases/*genetics', '*Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases']",,2001/03/15 10:00,2001/05/01 10:01,['2001/03/15 10:00'],"['2001/03/15 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/05/01 10:01 [medline]', '2001/03/15 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 2001 Apr;25(4):333-8. doi: 10.1016/s0145-2126(00)00130-2.,,,"['S0145-2126(00)00130-2 [pii]', '10.1016/s0145-2126(00)00130-2 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Thereafter, we transfected the tax gene in the expression vector (pCMV-Tax-neo) into the HTLV-I(-) T cell line Jurkat and examined the effects of ATRA on cell growth. The results showed that ATRA sensitivity was acquired by the Jurkat cells transfected with the tax gene expression vector, but not in those transfected with the control vector. We also observed NF-kappaB transcriptional activity on Jurkat cells transfected with the tax gene by CAT assay in the presence or absence of ATRA. NF-kappaB transcriptional activity was decreased significantly on Jurkat cells transfected with the tax gene after ATRA treatment.

To date, however, the biology of the hematopoietic system in this disorder is still not fully understood. In the present study, we have determined the progenitor cell content (including myeloid, erythroid and multipotent progenitors) in 14 children with ALL and followed the proliferation kinetics of these cells in Dexter-type long-term marrow cultures. We have also characterized some aspects related to the composition and function of the hematopoietic microenvironment developed in vitro. All patients included in this study showed extremely reduced levels of progenitor cells (median of 6.2% of the levels found in normal marrow). Proliferation of these cells in long-term cultures was markedly deficient, since they showed very low numbers - compared to normal cultures - and reached undetectable levels after only a few weeks. Regarding the microenvironment developed in vitro, whereas normal marrow samples contained a median of 8 fibroblastic progenitors/10(5) marrow cells and the stromal cell layers developed in culture contained a median of 341000 adherent cells per well, ALL marrow samples showed no fibroblastic progenitors and the numbers of adherent cells were 21% of those in normal cultures. Interestingly, the levels of TNFalpha and IL-6 in ALL culture supernatants were significantly increased, compared to normal cultures. Bone marrow samples from all 14 children were also analyzed once they reached a complete clinical and hematological remission. Myeloid, erythroid and multipotent progenitor cell levels were significantly increased, compared to patients at diagnosis, and proliferation of myeloid progenitors in long-term cultures was also improved. In contrast, proliferation of erythroid progenitors showed no difference to that in cultures from patients at diagnosis. The numbers of fibroblastic progenitors and adherent cells were significantly increased, compared to patients at diagnosis, and TNFalpha and IL-6 levels returned to normal. In summary, in the present study, we have demonstrated significant in vitro alterations of the hematopoietic system, both in terms of its composition and function, in pediatric patients with ALL. Importantly, most of these alterations are corrected, at least partially, after chemotherapy.","['Espinoza-Hernandez, L', 'Cruz-Rico, J', 'Benitez-Aranda, H', 'Martinez-Jaramillo, G', 'Rodriguez-Zepeda, M C', 'Velez-Ruelas, M A', 'Mayani, H']","['Espinoza-Hernandez L', 'Cruz-Rico J', 'Benitez-Aranda H', 'Martinez-Jaramillo G', 'Rodriguez-Zepeda MC', 'Velez-Ruelas MA', 'Mayani H']","['Oncological Research Unit, Oncology Hospital, National Medical Center, IMSS, Av.

In this study, the prognostic value of the LDH activity was examined in a cohort of 180 patients with de novo MDS (median age 71 years [27-93]; f/m-ratio 1:1.2; RA: n=53; RARS: n=37; RAEB: n=50; RAEBT: n=19; CMML: n=21).

An LDH level of >/=300 U/l was found to be associated with a significantly shorter median survival (10.3 months) when compared to <300 U/l (33.7 months; P<0.01). Moreover, an LDH activity of >/=300 U/l indicated a reduced AML-free survival in our MDS patients (P<0.01). As assessed by Cox regression, the inclusion of LDH as additional variable into the IPSS system resulted in an improved prediction concerning survival, but not with regard to AML evolution. Together, our data show that a serum LDH activity of >/=300 U/l in MDS is associated with a significantly shorter survival and higher risk to transform to AML.

The expression and production of VEGF and bFGF have been documented in numerous solid tumors and hematopoietic neoplasms. Having recently shown increased expression of cellular VEGF in the leukemic cells of patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) we decided to investigate the expression of angiogenic receptors Flt1 and Tie1. Levels of Tie1 and Flt1 proteins were measured in leukemic cells from 231 patients with B-cell CLL using Western blot analysis and solid-phase radioimmunoassay (RIA). A strong correlation was found between Flt1 and Tie1 levels and white blood cell count (WBC) and absolute lymphocyte counts. Levels of Flt1 but not Tie1 correlated with levels of cellular VEGF. Interestingly, Tie1 correlated well with Rai stage (P=0.04). Flt1 and Tie1 did not correlate with survival, although when we evaluated the patients with early disease (Rai stage 0-II), higher levels of Tie1 but not of Flt1 correlated with worse survival. These data suggest that Tie1 plays a role in the early stages of B-cell CLL and as the disease progresses, the tumor cells become independent from the effects of Tie1. Further studies are now needed to dissect the mechanisms responsible for this phenomenon.","['Aguayo, A', 'Manshouri, T', ""O'Brien, S"", 'Keating, M', 'Beran, M', 'Koller, C', 'Kantarjian, H', 'Rogers, A', 'Albitar, M']","['Aguayo A', 'Manshouri T', ""O'Brien S"", 'Keating M', 'Beran M', 'Koller C', 'Kantarjian H', 'Rogers A', 'Albitar M']","['Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas, M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, 1515 Holcombe Boulevard, Box 72, Houston, TX , 77030-4095, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,"['0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Cell Surface)', '0 (Receptors, Growth Factor)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor, TIE-1)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptors, TIE)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Receptor-1)']",IM,"['Actuarial Analysis', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Disease Progression', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*blood/diagnosis/pathology', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/metabolism/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neovascularization, Pathologic/blood', 'Prognosis', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*metabolism', 'Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*metabolism', 'Receptor, TIE-1', 'Receptors, Cell Surface/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Growth Factor/metabolism', 'Receptors, TIE', 'Statistics, Nonparametric', 'Survival Rate', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Receptor-1']",,2001/03/15 10:00,2001/05/01 10:01,['2001/03/15 10:00'],"['2001/03/15 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/05/01 10:01 [medline]', '2001/03/15 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 2001 Apr;25(4):279-85. doi: 10.1016/s0145-2126(00)00139-9.,,,"['S0145-2126(00)00139-9 [pii]', '10.1016/s0145-2126(00)00139-9 [doi]']",,,,['Leuk Res. 2001 Aug;25(8):709-10.

A study of an Italian family.,219-30,"Low levels of factor X (F.X) were detected in a 4-year-old boy who experienced acute lymphoblastic leukemia and bleeding manifestations. Laboratory data suggested the presence of a dysfunctional F.X molecule. Two novel F.X gene mutations were identified in the proband that was double heterozygous for both: a microdeletion (delC556) in exon VI resulting in a frameshift leading to a termination codon at position 226. This deletion was found in six family members with reduced F.X antigen and activity levels. A second mutation characterised by a G(1344)-->C transversion in exon VIII was detected in the proband resulting in a Lys(408)-->Asn substitution. This latter mutation was present in several asymptomatic family members from the paternal and the maternal side. The proband's sister was homozygous for the Lys(408)-->Asn substitution and exhibited low F.X activity with a normal antigen level. The naturally occurring F.X Lys(408)-->Asn (F.X(K408N)) variant was isolated from plasma of either homozygous or double heterozygous individuals. NH(2)-terminal sequencing of the heavy chain of F.X(K408N) failed to show any sequence abnormality in patients who were also carriers of the delC556, suggesting that this latter lesion accounted for the lack of F.X synthesis. Purified F.X Lys(408)-->Asn had an identical behaviour to normal F.X as judged by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. Clotting assay using purified F.X(K408N) and F.X-deficient plasma resulted in a laboratory phenotype similar to that observed in a homozygous subject for F.X Lys(408)-->Asn substitution. This is the first characterisation of a naturally occurring F.X variant with a mutation at the COOH-terminal end of the molecule.","['Simioni, P', 'Vianello, F', 'Kalafatis, M', 'Barzon, L', 'Ladogana, S', 'Paolucci, P', 'Carotenuto, M', 'Dal Bello, F', 'Palu, G', 'Girolami, A']","['Simioni P', 'Vianello F', 'Kalafatis M', 'Barzon L', 'Ladogana S', 'Paolucci P', 'Carotenuto M', 'Dal Bello F', 'Palu G', 'Girolami A']","['Department of Medical and Surgical Sciences, Second Chair of Medicine, University of Padua, Via Ospedale 105, 35100, Padua, Italy. simioni@ux1.unipd.it']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Thromb Res,Thrombosis research,0326377,"['0 (Codon, Terminator)', '9001-29-0 (Factor X)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Amino Acid Substitution', 'Base Sequence', 'Child, Preschool', 'Codon, Terminator/genetics', 'DNA/genetics', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', 'Factor X/*genetics', 'Factor X Deficiency/blood/complications/*genetics', 'Female', 'Frameshift Mutation', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genotype', 'Heterozygote', 'Homozygote', 'Humans', 'Italy', 'Male', '*Mutation', 'Mutation, Missense', 'Pedigree', 'Phenotype', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/complications', 'Sequence Deletion']",,2001/03/15 10:00,2001/06/19 10:01,['2001/03/15 10:00'],"['2001/03/15 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/06/19 10:01 [medline]', '2001/03/15 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Thromb Res. 2001 Feb 15;101(4):219-30. doi: 10.1016/s0049-3848(00)00406-0.,,,"['S0049-3848(00)00406-0 [pii]', '10.1016/s0049-3848(00)00406-0 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It affects middle aged adults presenting with splenomegaly, mild lymphocytosis and in 40% of cases with the presence of monoclonal paraprotein. Our material includes 10 patients (6 women + 4 men). In all patients bone marrow biopsy was the initial material for histopathological examination. With characteristic intertrabecular nodular interstitial infiltrates of CD20+ small lymphocytes and corresponding clinical data (splenomegaly, lymphocytosis in peripheral blood and sporadic elevation of IgM levels) it was very suggestive of SMZL diagnosis. Splenectomy was the treatment of choice. The spleen showed micronodular white foci in all cases. Morphologically the pattern of white pulp involvement was observed with lymphoma infiltrates as well as small foci in the red pulp. The white pulp showed follicles surrounded by a wide marginal zone, resembling reactive splenic follicles. A corona-like rim consisted of medium size cells with abundant clear cytoplasm, resembling monocytoid B cells, often with plasmacytoid differentiation, or centrocyte-like cells. Smaller aggregates of these cells were present in the red pulp. Lymphoma cells were CD20+, bcl-2 and IgM+. In all cases monoclonal kappa light chains were found. Although SMZL is a disseminated lymphoma at diagnosis, its course is indolent and splenectomy is the treatment of choice. Clinical and histopathological differential diagnoses include hairy cell leukemia and secondary involvement of the spleen by infiltrates of nodal B-cell lymphomas.","['Maryniak, R K', 'Prochorec-Sobieszek, M']","['Maryniak RK', 'Prochorec-Sobieszek M']","['Department of Pathomorphology, Institute of Haematology and Transfusiology, Warszawa.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Poland,Pol J Pathol,Polish journal of pathology : official journal of the Polish Society of Pathologists,9437432,,IM,"['Aged', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/*pathology/surgery', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Organ Size', 'Spleen/*pathology', 'Splenectomy', 'Splenomegaly/*pathology/surgery']",,2001/03/15 10:00,2001/04/17 10:01,['2001/03/15 10:00'],"['2001/03/15 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/04/17 10:01 [medline]', '2001/03/15 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Pol J Pathol. 2000;51(4):185-90.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The best characterised mechanism responsible for multidrug resistance involves the expression of the MDR-1 gene product, P-glycoprotein. However, the resistance process is multifactorial. Studies of multidrug resistance mechanisms have relied on the analysis of cancer cell lines that have been selected and present cross-reactivity to a broad range of anticancer agents. This work characterises a multidrug resistant cell line, originally selected for resistance to the Vinca alkaloid vincristine and derived from the human erythroleukaemia cell K562. This cell line, named Lucena 1, overexpresses P-glycoprotein and have its resistance reversed by the chemosensitisers verapamil, trifluoperazine and cyclosporins A, D and G. Furthermore, we demonstrated that methylene blue was capable of partially reversing the resistance in this cell line. On the contrary, the use of 5-fluorouracil increased the resistance of Lucena 1. In addition to chemotherapics, Lucena 1 cells were resistant to ultraviolet A radiation and hydrogen peroxide and failed to mobilise intracellular calcium when thapsigargin was used.

Truncated STAT isoforms (beta forms, rather than the normal alpha forms) have been described and found to block the normal signaling function of the alpha isoforms. We recently demonstrated STATbeta isoforms in bone marrow samples from 21 of 27 (78%) acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients. We sought to determine the mechanism by which the STATbeta forms were generated. Samples from eight newly diagnosed AML patients were studied; four expressed predominantly STATalpha, and four expressed predominantly STATbeta. The reverse transcription-PCR generated identical products in the two groups, suggesting that alternate mRNA splicing is not responsible for the genesis of STATbeta. Extracts from cells expressing predominantly STATbeta incubated with cell extracts from the MO7E cell line, which expresses predominantly STATa, caused a decrease of the alpha isoforms and an increase of the beta isoforms, suggesting the presence of proteolytic activity. This proteolytic activity was: (a) specific for STAT3 and STAT5, but not for STAT6; (b) serine dependent; (c) equally present in nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions of the leukemic blasts; and (d) different than the activity detected in a murine hematopoietic cell line. The cleaved beta isoforms retained their DNA-binding activity. Because expression of truncated STATs may be involved in blocking differentiation of AML blasts, elucidation of the regulation of the proteolytic activity may contribute to our understanding of leukemogenesis.","['Xia, Z', 'Salzler, R R', 'Kunz, D P', 'Baer, M R', 'Kazim, L', 'Baumann, H', 'Wetzler, M']","['Xia Z', 'Salzler RR', 'Kunz DP', 'Baer MR', 'Kazim L', 'Baumann H', 'Wetzler M']","['Department of Medicine, Biopolymer Facility, Roswell Park Cancer Institute, Buffalo, New York 14263, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Milk Proteins)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT3 protein, human)', '0 (STAT5 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', 'EC 3.4.21.- (Serine Endopeptidases)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Cytoplasm/enzymology', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*biosynthesis/metabolism', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/enzymology/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Milk Proteins', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor', 'STAT5 Transcription Factor', 'Serine Endopeptidases/*metabolism', 'Substrate Specificity', 'Trans-Activators/*biosynthesis/metabolism']",,2001/03/14 10:00,2001/04/03 10:01,['2001/03/14 10:00'],"['2001/03/14 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/04/03 10:01 [medline]', '2001/03/14 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 2001 Feb 15;61(4):1747-53.,,,,,"['CA16056/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA26122/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Here we test the hypothesis that DNA vaccination with the short peptide encompassing the complementary-determining region 3 hypervariable region of immunoglobulin heavy chain (VH-CDR3) may elicit a specific antibody immune response able to recognize the native antigens in the form required for therapy. As a test system, we used the VH-CDR3 sequences derived from two patients with non-Hodgkin's B lymphomas (PA, AS) and one patient with hairy cell leukemia (BA) to immunize outbred Swiss mice. This experimental model could mimic a clinical setting in which different patients present distinct HLA haplotypes. Individual tumor-specific VH-CDR3 sequences were amplified by a two-step procedure and directly cloned into multigenic plasmid vectors (pRC100 and derived) with and without mouse interleukin 2 (mIL-2). Each tumor-specific sequence was characterized by sequencing. Female Swiss mice were vaccinated i.m. with plasmids expressing the tumor-specific VH-CDR3 sequence alone (pRC101-PA), mIL-2 plus the VH-CDR3 sequence (pRC111-PA), or a different unrelated antigen (NS3 of hepatitis C virus; pRC112), the sole mIL-2 (pRC110), and the empty plasmid (pRC100). Boost injections were performed at 3 and 16 weeks from the first vaccination, and sera were drawn before each vaccination and at 6, 9, and 19 weeks. Induction of anti-VH-CDR3s antibodies in the sera and their ability to recognize native antigens on patients' tumor cells were evaluated by FACS analysis. Up to 56% (n = 25) of mice vaccinated with pRC111-PA plasmid and 20% (n = 15) of mice vaccinated with pRC101-PA developed a specific immune response that was maintained throughout 19 weeks of observation in 40% of pRC111-PA-vaccinated mice. No response was detected in sera obtained from mice vaccinated with the other plasmids (n = 45). pRC111-PA injection s.c. was less effective (13%, n = 15) than i.m. injection (53%, n = 15). Indeed, we demonstrated that antibodies elicited by naked DNA vaccination against three different patient-derived VH-CDR3 peptides (pRC111-PA or BA or AS) readily reacted with binding epitopes on the idiotypic proteins expressed on the surface of tumor cells derived from each patient; 60, 40, and 40% of, respectively, PA-, BA-, and AS-vaccinated mice developed specific antibodies. No cross-reactivity was detected among the three different CDR3s against tumor cells derived from the other two patients. The outbred mouse strategy confirmed the significant matching potential of three different VH-CDR3 peptides to be efficaciously presented through different MHCs. We conclude that individual VH-CDR3 DNA vaccination can result in a potentially effective specific immune response against non-Hodgkin's B lymphoma cells by a rapid and low-cost therapeutic approach.","['Rinaldi, M', 'Ria, F', 'Parrella, P', 'Signori, E', 'Serra, A', 'Ciafre, S A', 'Vespignani, I', 'Lazzari, M', 'Farace, M G', 'Saglio, G', 'Fazio, V M']","['Rinaldi M', 'Ria F', 'Parrella P', 'Signori E', 'Serra A', 'Ciafre SA', 'Vespignani I', 'Lazzari M', 'Farace MG', 'Saglio G', 'Fazio VM']","['Laboratory for Molecular and Biotechnology, Universita Campus Bio-Medico, Rome, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Antibodies, Anti-Idiotypic)', '0 (Antibodies, Neoplasm)', '0 (Cancer Vaccines)', '0 (Complementarity Determining Regions)', '0 (Epitopes)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Idiotypes)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Variable Region)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Vaccines, DNA)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Antibodies, Anti-Idiotypic/biosynthesis/immunology', 'Antibodies, Neoplasm/biosynthesis/blood/*immunology', 'Base Sequence', 'Cancer Vaccines/*immunology', 'Cell Line, Transformed', 'Complementarity Determining Regions/*immunology', 'Epitopes/immunology', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Genetic Vectors/administration & dosage/immunology', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/immunology', 'Immunoglobulin Idiotypes/immunology', 'Immunoglobulin Variable Region/immunology', 'Interleukin-2/biosynthesis', 'Leukemia, B-Cell/*immunology', 'Leukemia, Hairy Cell/immunology', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/*immunology', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Vaccines, DNA/*immunology']",,2001/03/14 10:00,2001/04/03 10:01,['2001/03/14 10:00'],"['2001/03/14 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/04/03 10:01 [medline]', '2001/03/14 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 2001 Feb 15;61(4):1555-62.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, the relationship between the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) response and apoptosis in ML-1 cells treated with vinblastine and paclitaxel was investigated. We show that these compounds elicit different effects on MAPKs with vinblastine, but not paclitaxel, increasing both c-Jun-NH2-terminal kinase (JNK) and p38 activity. However, vinblastine and paclitaxel both induced apoptosis with similar kinetics, suggesting that increased JNK and p38 activity is not required for apoptosis that is induced by microtubule interfering agents. Strikingly, the abrogation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)-signaling by the MAPK/ERK kinase (MEK)1/2 inhibitor PD098059 in combination with vinblastine robustly induced apoptosis in ML-1 cells at a rate much faster than treatment with vinblastine alone and occurred at all phases of the cell cycle. This apoptotic induction was attributed to JNK activation because: (a) non-JNK-activating concentrations of vinblastine failed to increase apoptosis in the presence of PD098059; (b) apoptosis induced by paclitaxel, which did not activate JNK, was not potentiated by PD098059; and (c) transduction of an inhibitor of JNK activity partially suppressed both JNK activity and apoptosis induced by vinblastine plus PD098059. Additionally, we found that the activation of JNK by vinblastine occurred upstream of effector caspase activation because treatment with a pan-specific caspase inhibitor (valine-alanine-aspartate-fluoromethylketone) resulted in complete abrogation of apoptosis with no effect on MAPK signaling. Taken together, these data suggest that inhibition of the MEK-->ERK signal transduction cascade alleviates cell cycle dependence for vinblastine-induced apoptosis by a mechanism that requires JNK activation.","['Stadheim, T A', 'Xiao, H', 'Eastman, A']","['Stadheim TA', 'Xiao H', 'Eastman A']","['Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, Dartmouth Medical School, Hanover, New Hampshire 03755, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Caspase Inhibitors)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Flavonoids)', '5V9KLZ54CY (Vinblastine)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.12.2 (MAP Kinase Kinase 4)', 'EC 2.7.12.2 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinases)', 'P88XT4IS4D (Paclitaxel)', 'SJE1IO5E3I (2-(2-amino-3-methoxyphenyl)-4H-1-benzopyran-4-one)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects/physiology', 'Caspase Inhibitors', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects/physiology', 'Drug Synergism', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Flavonoids/pharmacology', 'Humans', '*JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/drug therapy/enzymology/*pathology', 'MAP Kinase Kinase 4', 'MAP Kinase Signaling System/drug effects/physiology', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Paclitaxel/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Vinblastine/*pharmacology', 'p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases']",,2001/03/14 10:00,2001/04/03 10:01,['2001/03/14 10:00'],"['2001/03/14 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/04/03 10:01 [medline]', '2001/03/14 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 2001 Feb 15;61(4):1533-40.,,,,,"['CA50224/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'F32 CA86476/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 CA09658/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,

After screening more than 60,000 compounds, A-105972 was identified and selected for further testing. A-105972 is a small molecule that inhibits the growth of breast, central nervous system, colon, liver, lung, and prostate cancer cell lines, including multidrug-resistant cells. The cytotoxic IC50 values of A-105972 were between 20 and 200 nM, depending on the specific cell type. The potency of A-105972 is similar in cells expressing wild-type or mutant p53. A majority of cells treated with A-105972 were trapped in the G2-M phases, suggesting that A-105972 inhibits the progression of the cell cycle. Using [3H]A-105972, we found that A-105972 bound to purified tubulin. Unlabeled A-105972 competed with [3H]A-105972 binding with an IC50 value of 3.6 microL. Colchicine partially inhibited [3H]A-105972 binding with an IC50 value of approximately 90 microM, whereas paclitaxel and vinblastine had no significant effect. Tumor cells treated with A-105972 were observed to contain abnormal microtubule arrangement and apoptotic bodies. DNA ladder studies also indicated that A-105972 induced apoptosis. A-105972 caused a mobility shift of bcl-2 on SDS-PAGE, suggesting that A-105972 induced bcl-2 phosphorylation. A-105972 treatment increased the life span of mice inoculated with B16 melanoma, P388 leukemia, and Adriamycin-resistant P388. These results suggest that A-105972 is a small molecule that interacts with microtubules, arrests cells in G2-M phases, and induces apoptosis in both multidrug resistance-negative and multidrug resistance-positive cancer cells. A-105972 and its analogues may be useful for treating cell proliferative disorders such as cancer.","['Wu-Wong, J R', 'Alder, J D', 'Alder, L', 'Burns, D J', 'Han, E K', 'Credo, B', 'Tahir, S K', 'Dayton, B D', 'Ewing, P J', 'Chiou, W J']","['Wu-Wong JR', 'Alder JD', 'Alder L', 'Burns DJ', 'Han EK', 'Credo B', 'Tahir SK', 'Dayton BD', 'Ewing PJ', 'Chiou WJ']","['Pharmaceutical Products Division, Abbott Laboratories, Abbott Park, Illinois 60064, USA. ruth.r.wuwong@abbott.com']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (A 105972)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Oxadiazoles)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Tubulin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Inhibitory Concentration 50', 'Leukemia P388/drug therapy/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Inbred DBA', 'Microtubules/drug effects/metabolism', 'Oxadiazoles/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Protein Binding', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'Tubulin/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects']",,2001/03/14 10:00,2001/04/03 10:01,['2001/03/14 10:00'],"['2001/03/14 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/04/03 10:01 [medline]', '2001/03/14 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 2001 Feb 15;61(4):1486-92.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Western blot analysis showed a 4-6-fold overexpression of transgenic Crkl above endogenous crkl in two lines and increased constitutive complex formation between Crkl and C3G, an exchange factor for the small GTPase Rap1. This was associated with a significant increase in integrin-based motility of transgenic macrophages. Overexpression of Crkl was associated with increased incidence of tumor formation, and Rap1 was activated in a metastatic mammary carcinoma. The coexpression of Crkl and Bcr/Abl in mice transgenic for P190 BCR/ABL and CRKL markedly increased the rapidity of development of leukemia/lymphoma, decreasing the average survival by 3.8 months.

METHODS: On the basis of the materials collected from the member units around our country, various statistical methods, such as Kaplan-Meier and chi 2 tests, were used to estimate the probabilities of leukemia free survival (LFS). RESULTS: Up to July 31, 1996, a total of 1213 cases of stem cell transplantation (SCT) were performed in 61 medical units in the People's Republic of China, and 22 of the units are able to perform both allogeneic SCT (Allo-SCT) and autologous-SCT (ASCT). The remaining 41 units had the capacity only to perform autologous-SCT. There were 772 cases of autologous SCT performed. The three year probabilities of leukemia free survival for acute mylogeneous leukemia complete remission (AML-CR1) and acute lymphocyte leukemia complete remission (ALL-CR1) recipients were 56% and 42.8%, respectively. The three year probabilities of relapse were 44.8% and 47%, respectively. Among the patients with acute leukemia who attained CR1 within 40 days of diagnosis and who subsequently underwent autotransplantation within three to six months, the three year probabilities of LFS for acute mylogenous leukemia (AML) and acute lymphocyte leukemia (ALL) were 72% and 50%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Patients who attained complete remission (CR1) within 40 days after diagnosis and underwent subsequent autologous-SCT within three to six months of CR1 enjoyed a significantly increased LFS.","['Lu, D', 'Liu, D', 'Liu, K']","['Lu D', 'Liu D', 'Liu K']","[""Institute of Hematology, People's Hospital, Beijing Medical University, Beijing 100044, China.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],China,Chin Med J (Engl),Chinese medical journal,7513795,,IM,"['Adult', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation/methods', 'Female', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*therapy', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*therapy', '*Registries', 'Transplantation, Autologous/*statistics & numerical data']",,2001/03/14 10:00,2001/04/17 10:01,['2001/03/14 10:00'],"['2001/03/14 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/04/17 10:01 [medline]', '2001/03/14 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Chin Med J (Engl). 1998 Aug;111(8):675-7.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

TGF-beta is a multipotent cytokine that elicits many biological functions. In particular, TGF-beta exhibits effects on the cell cycle manifested by G1-phase arrest, differentiation, or apoptosis of several target cells, suggesting that disruption of TGF-beta signaling pathway could be involved in cancer formation. Here we show one missense mutation of the Smad4 gene in the MH1 domain (P102L) and one frame shift mutation resulting in termination in the MH2 domain (Delta(483 - 552)) in acute myelogeneous leukemia. Both of the mutated Smad4 proteins lack transcriptional activities. Concomitant expression of the P102L mutant with wild-type Smad4 inactivates wild-type Smad4 through inhibiting its DNA-binding ability. The Delta(483 - 552) mutant blocks nuclear translocation of wild-type Smad4 and thus disrupts TGF-beta signaling. This is the first report showing that mutations in the Smad4 gene are associated with the pathogenesis of acute myelogeneous leukemia and the obtained results should provide useful insights into the mechanism whereby disruption of TGF-beta signaling pathway could lead to acute myelogeneous leukemia.

Mutations in Pax3 lead to severe malformations as seen in human Waardenburg syndrome and in the Splotch mutant mice. The transcriptional activity of Pax3 was recently shown to be repressed by Daxx whereas the oncogenic fusion protein Pax3-FKHR is unresponsive to this repressive action. Here we demonstrate that Daxx-mediated repression of Pax3 can be inhibited by the nuclear body (NB)-associated protein PML. Interestingly, this suppression of Daxx properties correlates with its recruitment to the NBs. Factors such as arsenicals and interferons that enhance NB formation, trigger both the targeting of Daxx to these nuclear structures and the relief of the repressive activity of Daxx. Conversely, lack of structurally intact NBs profoundly impairs Pax3 transcriptional activity, likely by increasing the pool of available nucleoplasmic Daxx. Moreover, a PML mutant that can not be modified by the ubiquitin-related SUMO-1 modifier is no more able to interact with Daxx. Consistently, such a mutant fails both to inhibit the Daxx repressing effect on Pax3 and to induce its accumulation into the NBs. Taken together, these results argue that SUMO-1 modified PML can derepress Pax3 transcriptional activity through sequestration of the Daxx repressor into the NBs and suggest a role for these nuclear structures in the transcriptional control by Pax proteins.

In order to improve the outcome, we employed allogeneic stem cell transplantation (allo-SCT) for ATL in 10 patients, nine of whom were from HLA-identical siblings and one from an unrelated donor. Conditioning regimens varied among the patients except that all received total body irradiation. The patients tolerated the regimens well with mild, if any toxicity, and engraftment occurred in all cases. Median leukemia-free survival after allo-SCT was 17.5+ months (range 3.7-34.4+). Six of the 10 patients developed acute GVHD (one case each with grade I, III or IV, and three cases with grade II) and three patients developed extensive chronic GVHD. Four patients died after allo-SCT during the study period from either acute GVHD (grade IV), pneumonitis, gastrointestinal bleeding or renal insufficiency. Two of the 10 cases with no symptoms of GVHD relapsed with clinical ATL.

Adriamycin-containing chemotherapy regimens are considered as the standard therapy which induce long-term remission in about 60-70% of patients. The ABVD scheme, developed by Bonadonna and colleagues in Milan, has a favorable toxicity profile and causes less myelotoxicity, acute leukemia or sterility relative to many previous treatment programs containing alkylating agents. However, 20- 30 % of patients eventually relapse and are then frequently treated with high-dose programs including stem cell transplantation. There are two major goals in advanced Hodgkin's disease: (1) to improve the cure rate and (2) to reduce acute and long-term toxicities. The recent definition of prognostic factors identified patients who are at a high risk of treatment failure as well as those in whom less toxic approaches can be applied. The optimal approach or program has not yet been defined, although new chemotherapy regimens such as BEACOPP and Stanford V with increased tumor response rates have been identified. These new drug combinations are currently analyzed and compared with ABVD in several international trials. While the addition of radiotherapy improved disease control in some trials a survival benefit was not identified and the role of radiotherapy remains controversial. High dose programs remain experimental in advanced stage Hodgkin's disease and should be restricted to prospective clinical trials.","['Tesch, H', 'Sieber, M', 'Diehl, V']","['Tesch H', 'Sieber M', 'Diehl V']","['Klinikum der Stadt Villingen-Schwenningen GmbH, Deutschland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Switzerland,Oncology,Oncology,0135054,"['11056-06-7 (Bleomycin)', '35S93Y190K (Procarbazine)', '50D9XSG0VR (Mechlorethamine)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '5V9KLZ54CY (Vinblastine)', '7GR28W0FJI (Dacarbazine)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', 'VB0R961HZT (Prednisone)', 'ABVD protocol', 'MOPP protocol']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Bleomycin/administration & dosage', 'Chemotherapy, Adjuvant', 'Dacarbazine/administration & dosage', 'Doxorubicin/administration & dosage', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Hodgkin Disease/*drug therapy/pathology/*radiotherapy', 'Humans', 'Mechlorethamine/administration & dosage', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Prednisone/administration & dosage', 'Procarbazine/administration & dosage', 'Prognosis', 'Radiotherapy, Adjuvant/adverse effects', 'Vinblastine/administration & dosage', 'Vincristine/administration & dosage']",43,2001/03/13 10:00,2001/04/06 10:01,['2001/03/13 10:00'],"['2001/03/13 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/04/06 10:01 [medline]', '2001/03/13 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Oncology. 2001;60(2):101-9. doi: 10.1159/000055305.,,,"['55305 [pii]', '10.1159/000055305 [doi]']",,,['German Hodgkin Study Group'],,,,,,,,,,,

Semiquantitative RT-PCR assay on mouse embryonic stem cell clones during in vitro differentiation and Northern blot analysis of a mouse embryo revealed that AML1b is expressed in undifferentiated ES cells and upregulated in the early developmental stage, in contrast to the gradual upregulation and steady maintenance of AML1c expression during embryogenesis. In addition, maintenance of AML1c expression depended on the presence of active AML1 allele(s) while that of AML1b did not. Thus, these two AML1 isoforms driven by their respective promoters are differentially expressed and are likely to have distinct functions in early hematopoietic development.","['Fujita, Y', 'Nishimura, M', 'Taniwaki, M', 'Abe, T', 'Okuda, T']","['Fujita Y', 'Nishimura M', 'Taniwaki M', 'Abe T', 'Okuda T']","['Department of Hygiene, Kyoto Prefectural University of Medicine, Kawaramachi-Hirokoji, Kamigyo-ku, Kyoto, 602-8566, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Biochem Biophys Res Commun,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,0372516,"['0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Protein Isoforms)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RUNX1 protein, human)', '0 (Runx1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",IM,"['Alternative Splicing', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Blotting, Northern', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Clone Cells', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental', '*Hematopoiesis', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*metabolism/physiology', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Protein Isoforms/genetics/metabolism', '*Proto-Oncogene Proteins', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid', 'Sequence Homology, Nucleic Acid', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics/metabolism', 'Transcription, Genetic']",,2001/03/13 10:00,2001/05/01 10:01,['2001/03/13 10:00'],"['2001/03/13 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/05/01 10:01 [medline]', '2001/03/13 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Biochem Biophys Res Commun. 2001 Mar;281(5):1248-55. doi: 10.1006/bbrc.2001.4513.,,['Copyright 2001 Academic Press.'],"['10.1006/bbrc.2001.4513 [doi]', 'S0006-291X(01)94513-9 [pii]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Surprisingly, the three-dimensional structures of the CA from different genera exhibit alpha-helical structural features that are highly conserved. The N-terminal residues of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) and Rous sarcoma virus (RSV) capsid proteins form a beta-hairpin. To determine if this feature is conserved in the retroviral family, we cloned, expressed, purified, and solved the structure of a N-terminal 134 amino acid fragment (CA(134)) from the human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-I) using high resolution nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. The CA(134) fragment contains an N-terminal beta-hairpin and a central coiled-coil-like structure composed of six alpha-helices. The N-terminal Pro1 residue contacts Asp54 in the helical cluster through a salt bridge. Thus, the beta-hairpin is conserved and the helical cluster is structurally similar to other retroviral CA domains. However, although the same Asp residue defines the orientation of the hairpin in both the HTLV-1 and HIV-1 CA proteins, the HTLV-I hairpin is oriented away, rather than towards, the helical core. Significant differences were also detected in the spatial orientation and helical content of the long centrally located loop connecting the helices in the core. It has been proposed that the salt bridge allows the formation of a CA-CA interface that is important for the assembly of the conical cores that are characteristic of HIV-1. As HTLV-I forms spherical cores, the salt-bridge feature is apparently not conserved for this function although its role in determining the orientation of the beta-hairpin may be critical, along with the central loop. Comparison of three-dimensional structures is expected to elucidate the relationships between the retroviral capsid protein structure and its function.","['Cornilescu, C C', 'Bouamr, F', 'Yao, X', 'Carter, C', 'Tjandra, N']","['Cornilescu CC', 'Bouamr F', 'Yao X', 'Carter C', 'Tjandra N']","['Laboratory of Biophysical Chemistry, Bldg. 3, NHLBI, NIH, Bethesda, MD, 20892-0380, USA']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,J Mol Biol,Journal of molecular biology,2985088R,"['0 (HTLV-I Antigens)', '0 (Peptide Fragments)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', 'EC 5.2.1.- (Cyclophilin A)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Binding Sites', 'Capsid/*chemistry/metabolism', 'Conserved Sequence', 'Cyclophilin A/metabolism', 'HIV-1/chemistry', 'HTLV-I Antigens/chemistry/metabolism', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*chemistry', 'Humans', 'Models, Molecular', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Nuclear Magnetic Resonance, Biomolecular', 'Peptide Fragments/chemistry/metabolism', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Structure, Secondary', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Recombinant Proteins/chemistry/metabolism', 'Sequence Alignment']",,2001/03/13 10:00,2001/04/17 10:01,['2001/03/13 10:00'],"['2001/03/13 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/04/17 10:01 [medline]', '2001/03/13 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Mol Biol. 2001 Mar 2;306(4):783-97. doi: 10.1006/jmbi.2000.4395.,,['Copyright 2001 Academic Press.'],"['10.1006/jmbi.2000.4395 [doi]', 'S0022-2836(00)94395-X [pii]']",,['GM 48294/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States'],,,,['PDB/1G03'],,,,,,,,

A soluble form of IL-6R (sIL-6R), which lacks transmembrane and cytoplasmic regions, retains the ability to bind IL-6 and signal through gp130. We show here that a fusion protein of sIL-6R and IL-6 without a polypeptide linker, termed FP6, induces differentiation of astrocytes from fetal mouse neuroepithelial cells as potently as a representative IL-6 family cytokine, leukaemia inhibitory factor (LIF). FP6 has a potential to activate a transcription factor, signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3), and mitogen-activated protein kinases, ERK1 and ERK2, in these cells as does LIF. FP6 activates a promoter of the gene for an astrocytic marker, glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), in neuroepithelial cells. This activation is virtually abolished by ectopic expression of a dominant-negative form of STAT3, or by introducing a point mutation into the STAT3 response element located in the GFAP promoter. These results suggest that FP6 induces astrocyte differentiation from neuroepithelial cells through STAT3 activation and that FP6 could be of use as a substitute for natural IL-6 family cytokines.","['Takizawa, T', 'Yanagisawa, M', 'Ochiai, W', 'Yasukawa, K', 'Ishiguro, T', 'Nakashima, K', 'Taga, T']","['Takizawa T', 'Yanagisawa M', 'Ochiai W', 'Yasukawa K', 'Ishiguro T', 'Nakashima K', 'Taga T']","['Department of Cell Fate Modulation, Institute of Molecular Embryology and Genetics, Kumamoto University, Kumamoto, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Cytokine,Cytokine,9005353,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Glial Fibrillary Acidic Protein)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-6)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Stat3 protein, mouse)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 3)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Astrocytes/*cytology/metabolism/*physiology', 'Cell Differentiation', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*metabolism', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Epithelial Cells/*metabolism', 'Female', 'Genes, Dominant', 'Glial Fibrillary Acidic Protein/metabolism', 'Growth Inhibitors/metabolism', 'Immunoblotting', 'Interleukin-6/*metabolism', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Lymphokines/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred ICR', 'Microscopy, Fluorescence', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1/metabolism', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 3', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/metabolism', 'Neurons/*metabolism', 'Point Mutation', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Receptors, Interleukin-6/*metabolism', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/*metabolism', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor', 'Signal Transduction', 'Trans-Activators/*metabolism']",,2001/03/13 10:00,2001/06/02 10:01,['2001/03/13 10:00'],"['2001/03/13 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/06/02 10:01 [medline]', '2001/03/13 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cytokine. 2001 Mar 7;13(5):272-9. doi: 10.1006/cyto.2000.0831.,,,"['10.1006/cyto.2000.0831 [doi]', 'S1043-4666(00)90831-7 [pii]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The wild-type RARalpha readily forms heterodimers with the retinoid X receptors (RXRs), and these RAR/RXR heterodimers appear to be the principal mediators of retinoid signaling in normal cells. In contrast, PML-RARalpha and PLZF-RARa display an enhanced ability to form homodimers, and this enhanced homodimer formation is believed to contribute to the neoplastic properties of these chimeric oncoproteins. We report here that the DNA recognition specificity of the RXRalpha/RARa heterodimer, which is presumed to be the dominant receptor species in normal cells, differs from that of the PML-RARalpha and PLZF-RARalpha homodimers, which are thought to prevail in the oncogenic cell.

While E2A is fused to PBX1 in most ALLs with a t(1;19), 5-10% of cases have translocations that appear identical, but do not affect E2A or PBX1. Because more intensive therapy improves the outcome of patients with E2A-PBX1positive (1;19) translocations, it is critical to identify this subset of patients so that appropriate therapy can be administered. In addition, there are balanced and unbalanced variants of the t(1;19) and controversy exists regarding the clinical significance of this distinction. We have developed a two-color fluorescence in situ hybridization assay that accurately detects E2A translocations in metaphase and interphase cells, distinguishes between balanced and unbalanced variants and identifies patients with a t(1;19) who lack E2A-PBX1 fusion. We found that clonal microheterogeneity is common in patients with E2A translocations and most patients have mixtures of cells with balanced and unbalanced translocations, suggesting that this distinction represents two ends of a continuum rather than distinct biological entities. These reagents should have widespread clinical utility and be useful for translational and basic research studies involving E2A translocations and this region of chromosome 19p13.","['Boomer, T', 'Varella-Garcia, M', 'McGavran, L', 'Meltesen, L', 'Olsen, A S', 'Hunger, S P']","['Boomer T', 'Varella-Garcia M', 'McGavran L', 'Meltesen L', 'Olsen AS', 'Hunger SP']","['Department of Pediatrics, University of Colorado School of Medicine, Denver, CO, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (E2a-Hlf fusion protein, human)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (TCF3 protein, human)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '146150-85-8 (E2A-Pbx1 fusion protein)']",IM,"['Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 1', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 17', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 19', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics', 'Homeodomain Proteins/genetics', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Leukemia/*genetics', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/genetics', 'Transcription Factors/analysis/*genetics', '*Translocation, Genetic', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,2001/03/13 10:00,2001/04/03 10:01,['2001/03/13 10:00'],"['2001/03/13 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/04/03 10:01 [medline]', '2001/03/13 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2001 Jan;15(1):95-102. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2401988.,,,['10.1038/sj.leu.2401988 [doi]'],,['CA 46934/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,

Thus, coadministration of 6MP could increase myelotoxicity following HDM. Twenty-one children with standard risk (SR) and 25 with intermediate risk (IR) acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) were studied. During consolidation therapy they received either three courses of HDM at 2 week intervals without concurrent oral 6MP (SR-ALL) or four courses of HDM given at 2 week intervals with 25 mg/m2 of oral 6MP daily (IR-ALL). During the first year of maintenance with oral 6MP (75 mg/m2/day) and oral MTX (20 mg/m2/week) they all received five courses of HDM at 8 week intervals. In all cases, HDM consisted of 5,000 mg of MTX/m2 given over 24 h with intraspinal MTX and leucovorin rescue. Erythrocyte levels of 6TGN (E-6TGN) and methotrexate (E-MTX) were, on average, measured every second week during maintenance therapy. When SR consolidation (6MP: 0 mg), IR consolidation (6MP: 25 mg/m2), and SR/IR maintenance therapy (6MP: 75 mg/m2) were compared, white cell and absolute neutrophil count (ANC) nadir, lymphocyte count nadir, thrombocyte count nadir, and hemoglobin nadir after HDM decreased significantly with increasing doses of oral 6MP. Three percent of the HDM courses given without oral 6MP (SR consolidation) were followed by an ANC nadir <0.5 x 10(9)/l compared to 50% of the HDM courses given during SR/IR maintenance therapy. Similarly, only 13% of the HDM courses given as SR-ALL consolidation induced a thrombocyte count nadir <100 x 10(9)/l compared to 58% of the HDM courses given during maintenance therapy. The best-fit model to predict the ANC nadir following HDM during maintenance therapy included the dose of 6MP prior to HDM (beta = -0.017, P= 0.001), the average ANC level during maintenance therapy (beta = 0.82, P = 0.004), and E-6TGN (beta = -0.0029, P= 0.02). The best-fit model to predict the thrombocyte nadir following HDM during maintenance therapy included only mPLATE (beta = 0.0057, P = 0.046). In conclusion, the study indicates that reductions of the dose of concurrently given oral 6MP could be one way of reducing the risk of significant myelotoxicity following HDM during maintenance therapy of childhood ALL.","['Schmiegelow, K', 'Bretton-Meyer, U']","['Schmiegelow K', 'Bretton-Meyer U']","['The Laboratory for Pediatric Oncology, The Pediatric Clinic II, The Juliane Marie Centre, The National University Hospital, Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen, Denmark.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', 'E7WED276I5 (Mercaptopurine)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/administration & dosage', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*administration & dosage/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics', 'Bone Marrow/drug effects/pathology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Mercaptopurine/administration & dosage/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics', 'Methotrexate/administration & dosage/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/pathology']",,2001/03/13 10:00,2001/04/03 10:01,['2001/03/13 10:00'],"['2001/03/13 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/04/03 10:01 [medline]', '2001/03/13 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2001 Jan;15(1):74-9. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2401986.,,,['10.1038/sj.leu.2401986 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Incubation experiments carried out with cell lines showed F-ara-A and HU to be equipotent in increasing ara-CTP levels. The highest increase was observed in HL-60 cells whereas preincubation had no modulatory effect in MOLT-4 cells. Accordingly, modulation of intracellular ara-CTP levels differed between the subtypes of childhood acute leukemia: whereas in T-ALL (five) preincubation with F-ara-A and HU had no effect on intracellular ara-C metabolism, increased ara-CTP levels were seen in some cases of pre-B-ALL (seven). In myelogenous blasts (12) clinically relevant enhancement of ara-C toxification was regularly obtained with both, F-ara-A (1.9-fold) and HU (1.5-fold).

We found a high proportion of 12.51 +/- 1.19% of CD34+ peripheral blood progenitor cells (PBPC) in S/G2M phase. Comparison of PB and BM from 19 cases revealed similar proliferation rates (10.74 +/- 1.41% vs 15.97 +/- 1.95%). Furthermore, even primitive CD34+/CD38- PBPC displayed high proliferation rates (17.45 +/- 2.98%) in 10 cases examined. In contrast, PBPC from 11 patients with BCR/ABL-negative myeloproliferative disorders were almost noncycling (S/G2M 1.46 +/- 0.47%). When matched pairs of PB and BM from six patients with BCR/ABL-negative myeloproliferative disorders were examined, only 0.89 +/- 0.41% of the CD34+ PBPC, but 8.29 +/- 3.13% CD34+ cells from BM were in S/G2M phase. Consistently, as compared to 19 patients with newly diagnosed BCR/ABL-positive CML, a significantly lower PB/BM ratio of CD34+ cells in S/G2M phase was found in these six patients with BCR/ABL-negative myeloprolifrative disorders. Administration of the tyrosine kinase inhibitor STI571 to 13 patients with CML in chronic phase, accelerated phase, or blast crisis lead to an inhibition of PBPC proliferation within a few days. Interestingly, CD34+ hematopoietic progenitor cells from BM remained proliferating in five cases examined, indicating that CML PBPC are more easily inhibited by STI571 as compared to CD34+ CML hematopoietic progenitor cells from BM. These data suggest that BCR/ABL leads to an enhanced cell cycle activation of CD34+ cells, which seems to be, at least in part, independent of additional factors provided by the bone marrow microenvironment.","['Kramer, A', 'Loffler, H', 'Bergmann, J', 'Hochhaus, A', 'Hehlmann, R']","['Kramer A', 'Loffler H', 'Bergmann J', 'Hochhaus A', 'Hehlmann R']","['III Medizinische Klinik, Klinikum Mannheim, Universitat Heidelberg, Mannheim, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Cell Division/genetics', 'Female', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*genetics', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/genetics/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged']",,2001/03/13 10:00,2001/04/03 10:01,['2001/03/13 10:00'],"['2001/03/13 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/04/03 10:01 [medline]', '2001/03/13 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2001 Jan;15(1):62-8. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2402005.,,,['10.1038/sj.leu.2402005 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In an attempt to prevent relapses originating from graft leukemic contamination, the experimental protocol of in vitro purification of leukapheretic products with monoclonal antibodies (MoAbs), previously reported for adults, was adopted in 11 of 12 consecutive patients (median age, 9 years) with B cell precursor ALL in CR2 after late relapse (median, 37; range, 31-51 months after the onset) enrolled between July 1997 and July 1999 at a single pediatric center. At a median of 12 days after the mobilizing chemotherapy followed by G-CSF, a median of 13.9 (range, 5.9-18.7) x 10(6) CD34+ cells/kg were collected from each patient and a median of 7.5 (range, 4.1-12.6) x 10(6) CD34+ cells/kg underwent the purification procedure. The first step of immunorosetting allowed a one-log reduction of the total cell count, by eliminating more than 90% of the CD11b+ cells; the second step, performed after incubation with anti-CD19 MoAbs, allowed the depletion of 99% (range, 93-100) of the CD19+ cells, kept within the magnetic field of the immunodepletion column, with a median recovery of 73% (range, 55-87) of the collected CD34+ cells. Molecular analysis assessed the in vitro eradication of detectable leukemic cells. A median reinfusion of 5.2 (range, 3.2-9.1) x 10(6) CD34+ cells/kg for each patient (median viability, 90%), after conditioning with the 'TBI-VP16-CY' regimen, allowed prompt engraftment and immunological reconstitution; no patients experienced severe transplant-related toxicity or major infections. One patient relapsed 7 months after transplantation, while 10 patients are alive in clinical and molecular remission, at a median follow-up of 29 months (range, 15-40) (2-year EFS, 89%, s.e. 9). In conclusion, the procedure proved to be reproducible for pediatric purified autografting, highly efficient concerning stem cell recovery and depletion of leukemia-lineage specific cells, and promising in terms of final outcome.","['Balduzzi, A', 'Gaipa, G', 'Bonanomi, S', 'Dassi, M', 'Perseghin, P', 'Buscemi, F', ""D'Aniello, E"", 'Rovelli, A', 'Schiro, R', 'Longoni, D', 'Rambaldi, A', 'Uderzo, C', 'Biondi, A']","['Balduzzi A', 'Gaipa G', 'Bonanomi S', 'Dassi M', 'Perseghin P', 'Buscemi F', ""D'Aniello E"", 'Rovelli A', 'Schiro R', 'Longoni D', 'Rambaldi A', 'Uderzo C', 'Biondi A']","['Clinica Pediatrica Universita di Milano-Bicocca, Ospedale San Gerardo, Monza, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Female', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Mobilization', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics/pathology/*prevention & control', 'Secondary Prevention', 'Transplantation, Autologous', 'Treatment Outcome']",,2001/03/13 10:00,2001/04/03 10:01,['2001/03/13 10:00'],"['2001/03/13 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/04/03 10:01 [medline]', '2001/03/13 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2001 Jan;15(1):50-6. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2402004.,,,['10.1038/sj.leu.2402004 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The registration data and initial discharge summaries were reviewed for all children diagnosed with AML, and registered by the Dutch Childhood Leukaemia Study Group (DCLSG). Between 1972 and 1998, 477 children were diagnosed with AML. Of these patients, 120 (25.1%) had extramedullary leukaemia (EML) at diagnosis. Four categories of EML were found: skin, soft tissue or bone, gingival infiltration and central nervous system (CNS) involvement. Patients who presented with gingival infiltrates, were older than those without EML or those in the other EML subgroups, had a high initial WBC count and a high proportion of M4/M5 morphological variants. This type of presentation could indicate a special biological entity. Univariate analysis of prognostic factors in patients treated after 1985 with intensive protocols showed that initial WBC count and the presence of favourable cytogenetic findings were significant. The presence of EML at diagnosis had no significant effect on event-free survival. In a stepwise multiple regression analysis only favourable cytogenetic findings remained significant.","['Bisschop, M M', 'Revesz, T', 'Bierings, M', 'van Weerden, J F', 'van Wering, E R', 'Hahlen, K', 'van der Does-van den Berg, A']","['Bisschop MM', 'Revesz T', 'Bierings M', 'van Weerden JF', 'van Wering ER', 'Hahlen K', 'van der Does-van den Berg A']","['Department of Paediatric Haematology-Oncology, University Medical Centre, Utrecht, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*pathology/physiopathology', 'Leukemic Infiltration/*pathology', 'Male', 'Prognosis', 'Retrospective Studies']",,2001/03/13 10:00,2001/04/03 10:01,['2001/03/13 10:00'],"['2001/03/13 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/04/03 10:01 [medline]', '2001/03/13 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2001 Jan;15(1):46-9. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2401971.,,,['10.1038/sj.leu.2401971 [doi]'],,,,['Leukemia. 2002 May;16(5):962; author reply 963.

Five patients developed a second cancer (two carcinomas of the parotid gland, one non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, one supratentorial primitive neuroectodermal tumor, one acute lymphoblastic leukemia) as compared with 0.47 expected in the general population (standardized incidence ratio, 10.64; 95% confidence interval, 3.28 to 22.34). A third neoplasm (meningioma) developed in one patient. At 15 years after the diagnosis of AML, the estimated cumulative incidence of second malignancy was 1.34% +/- 0.61%, whereas the cumulative incidence of death due to any other cause was 72.96% +/- 2.14%. We concluded that although a more than 10-fold increased risk of development of cancer was found in survivors of childhood AML as compared to the general population, the risk of this late complication is small when compared to the much larger risk of death because of the primary leukemia or the early complications of its treatment. Future studies should focus on improving treatments for primary AML while preventing second malignancies.","['Leung, W', 'Ribeiro, R C', 'Hudson, M', 'Tong, X', 'Srivastava, D K', 'Rubnitz, J E', 'Sandlund, J T', 'Razzouk, B I', 'Evans, W E', 'Pui, C H']","['Leung W', 'Ribeiro RC', 'Hudson M', 'Tong X', 'Srivastava DK', 'Rubnitz JE', 'Sandlund JT', 'Razzouk BI', 'Evans WE', 'Pui CH']","[""Department of Hematology-Oncology, St Jude Children's Research Hospital, and University of Tennessee, College of Medicine, Memphis, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cohort Studies', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/drug therapy/*pathology', 'Male', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/etiology/*pathology', 'Risk']",,2001/03/13 10:00,2001/04/03 10:01,['2001/03/13 10:00'],"['2001/03/13 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/04/03 10:01 [medline]', '2001/03/13 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2001 Jan;15(1):41-5. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2401948.,,,['10.1038/sj.leu.2401948 [doi]'],,"['CA-20180/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-21765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,

No patient had the Philadelphia chromosome or the BCR/ABL fusion gene. None of the common cytogenetic abnormalities characteristic of myeloid disorders were detected. Two patients demonstrated clonal evolution during the course of the disease. All responded initially to therapy with hydroxyurea with control of leukocytosis and reduction in splenomegaly. Three patients eventually became refractory to hydroxyurea, manifesting progressive neutrophilia without blastic transformation. Aggressive chemotherapy to control progressive leukocytosis resulted in death due to cytopenias in two of these patients. The third patient received less intensive chemotherapy and died of progressive disease. One patient died after transformation of the disease into undifferentiated acute myeloid leukemia. Two patients remain alive with stable disease on hydroxyurea therapy, 12 and 54 months after initial diagnosis. Chronic neutrophilic leukemia is a rare clinicopathologic entity that can be distinguished from chronic myelogenous leukemia, the recently described neutrophilic-chronic myelogenous leukemia, and myelodysplastic syndrome. The clinical course is heterogeneous, with a definite risk of death from either blastic transformation or progressive neutrophilic leukocytosis. Continued study and reporting of these cases must be encouraged.","['Elliott, M A', 'Dewald, G W', 'Tefferi, A', 'Hanson, C A']","['Elliott MA', 'Dewald GW', 'Tefferi A', 'Hanson CA']","['Division of Hematology and Internal Medicine, Mayo Clinic and Mayo Foundation, Rochester, MN 55905, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,,IM,"['Humans', '*Leukemia, Neutrophilic, Chronic/genetics/pathology/physiopathology']",20,2001/03/13 10:00,2001/04/03 10:01,['2001/03/13 10:00'],"['2001/03/13 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/04/03 10:01 [medline]', '2001/03/13 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2001 Jan;15(1):35-40. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2401993.,,,['10.1038/sj.leu.2401993 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Despite correlations between drug export and drug resistance, it is increasingly apparent that such mechanisms cannot fully account for chemoresistance in neoplasia. It is now widely accepted that chemotherapeutic drugs kill tumour cells by inducing apoptosis, a genetically regulated cell death programme. Evidence is emerging that the exploitation of survival pathways, which may have contributed to disease development in the first instance, may also be important in the development of the chemoresistance.

In the present study, we aimed to determine the power of comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) as compared to standard chromosome analysis (CA) to detect such secondary aberrations. The same lymph node cell suspensions prepared from 30 patients with FCDL were analyzed in parallel by CGH and CA based on R banding. In all, 73 discrepancies were found. Sixty-two imbalances were detected only by CA and 11 only by CGH. In cases with completely resolved karyotypes (n= 17), the median number of discrepancies between CGH and CA was one. However, when the karyotype was partially resolved (n = 12), the median was four (P < 0.01). Discrepant results were further studied by fluorescence in situ hybridization using locus-specific probes. These data confirm, that not only for the detection of balanced aberrations, but also for the detection of unbalanced aberrations in FCDL, standard chromosome analysis is still the 'gold standard'.

In order to assess whether EC overgrowth in MM reflects a spontaneous in vitro angiogenesis, BM mononucleated cells from 13 untreated (UT) MM, 20 treated (11 with melphalan and nine with DAV schedule) MM, eight patients with monoclonal gammopathy of uncertain significance (MGUS) and eight controls were seeded in an unselective medium to assess EC proliferation. Furthermore, the influence of IL6 on the EC growth was investigated. Endothelial colonies (CFU-En) appeared as small clusters, formed by at least 100 slightly elongated and sometimes bi-nucleated cells expressing factor VIII, CD31 and CD105 (endoglin). The CFU-En mean number/10(6) BM mononucleated cells in untreated MM samples (2.07 s.d. +/- 1.3) was significantly higher than in normal BM (0.28 +/- 0.48), while no difference was seen between normal BM and MGUS (0.28 +/- 0.54). Interestingly, the mean number of CFU-En in the DAV group (1.88 +/- 1.6) did not differ from the UT, while it was found to be lower in the melphalan group (0.31 +/- 0.63). The addition of anti-IL6 monoclonal antibody induced a reduction of both the plasma cells in the supernatant and the CFU-En number.

Recent studies have shown that patients with increased risk of relapse can be identified by measuring residual leukemic cells, called minimal residual disease (MRD), during clinical remission. Current PCR methods, however, for measuring MRD are cumbersome and time-consuming. To improve and simplify MRD assessment, we developed a real-time quantitative PCR (RQ-PCR) assay for detection of leukemic cells that harbor the TAL-1 deletion. We studied serial dilutions of leukemic DNA and found the assay had a sensitivity of detection of one leukemic cell among 100,000 normal cells. We then investigated 23 samples from eight children with ALL in clinical remission. We quantified residual leukemic cells by using the TAL-1 RQ-PCR assay and by using limiting dilution analysis. In 17 samples, both methods detected MRD levels > or =0.001%. The percentages of leukemic cells measured by the two methods correlated well (r2 = 0.926). In the remaining six samples, both methods detected fewer than 0.001% leukemic cells. We conclude the TAL-1 RQ-PCR assay can be used for rapid, sensitive and accurate assessment of MRD in T-lineage ALL with the TAL-1 deletion.","['Chen, X', 'Pan, Q', 'Stow, P', 'Behm, F G', 'Goorha, R', 'Pui, C H', 'Neale, G A']","['Chen X', 'Pan Q', 'Stow P', 'Behm FG', 'Goorha R', 'Pui CH', 'Neale GA']","[""Department of Hematology/Oncology, St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN 38105, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '135471-20-4 (TAL1 protein, human)']",IM,"['Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors', 'Cell Lineage', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/analysis/*genetics', 'Gene Deletion', 'Humans', 'Neoplasm, Residual/genetics/*pathology', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction/methods', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics/*pathology', '*Proto-Oncogene Proteins', 'T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1', 'T-Lymphocytes/pathology', '*Transcription Factors']",,2001/03/13 10:00,2001/04/03 10:01,['2001/03/13 10:00'],"['2001/03/13 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/04/03 10:01 [medline]', '2001/03/13 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2001 Jan;15(1):166-70. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2402000.,,,['10.1038/sj.leu.2402000 [doi]'],,"['P30 CA21765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA43237/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA52259/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,

The genes encoding the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors p16INK4A and p15INK4B are potent TSGs, and correlations between their inactivation and disease progression have also been reported in various malignancies. In this study, we analyzed the methylation status of p16INK4A and p15INK4B gene promoters in plasma cell dyscrasias (PCDs) by methylation-specific PCR (MSP). In analyses using DNAs extracted from bone marrow mononuclear cells (BM-MNCs), patients with multiple myeloma (MM) showed frequent hypermethylation of the p16INK4A gene (15/37, 41%), whereas p15INK4B gene methylation was not so frequent (5/37, 14%). Many patients whose BM-MNC showed dense methylation of the p16INK4A gene had extramedullary plasmacytoma (extra-PC), and all available extra-PC samples showed alterations of the p16INK4A gene (4; dense methylation, 1; homozygous deletion). In contrast to MM, hypermethylation of the p16INK4A gene was significantly infrequent in indolent PCDs (2/22, 9%, P= 0.0055). The infrequency in indolent PCDs was also confirmed by analyses using DNAs extracted from BM smears (1/29, 3%). It is possible that hypermethylation of the p16INK4A gene promoter contributes to progression to aggressive MM from indolent PCD, especially to extra-PC development.","['Uchida, T', 'Kinoshita, T', 'Ohno, T', 'Ohashi, H', 'Nagai, H', 'Saito, H']","['Uchida T', 'Kinoshita T', 'Ohno T', 'Ohashi H', 'Nagai H', 'Saito H']","['First Department of Internal Medicine, Nagoya University School of Medicine, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p16)']",IM,"['Biomarkers', 'Carrier Proteins/*genetics', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p16', 'DNA Methylation', 'Humans', 'Paraproteinemias/*genetics/physiopathology', 'Prognosis', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic']",,2001/03/13 10:00,2001/04/03 10:01,['2001/03/13 10:00'],"['2001/03/13 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/04/03 10:01 [medline]', '2001/03/13 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2001 Jan;15(1):157-65. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2401991.,,,['10.1038/sj.leu.2401991 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Immunophenotypic analysis showed that FLK-1 expressed CD10, CD19, CD20, CD38, IgG and HLA-DR, which is a typical feature of germinal center B cells. Cytogenetic analysis of FLK-1 demonstrated t(14;18)(q32;q21) translocation involving BCL2 and immunoglobulin heavy chain genes. Especially noteworthy is that the growth of FLK-1 was found to be dependent on a FDC line, HK. When HK cells were removed from the culture, FLK-1 cells stopped growing and eventually died. An apoptotic mechanism appeared to be involved as indicated by the presence of chromosome condensation and DNA ladder formation. The culture experiment using micropore membranes showed that soluble factor(s) of HK cells supported the growth, while direct cell-to-cell contact appeared to be necessary for longterm cell proliferation. These findings suggest the importance of the micro-environment for follicular lymphoma cells to grow.

It is known that ongoing rearrangements result in subclone formation, and that the relapsing subclone(s) can contain antigen receptor rearrangement(s) that differ from the rearrangements found in the major clone(s) at diagnosis. However, the mechanism leading to this so-called clonal evolution is not known, particularly at which time point in the disease the relapsing subclone obtains its (relative) therapy resistance. To obtain insight in clonal evolution, we followed the kinetics of several subclones in three oligoclonal ALL patients during induction therapy. Clone-specific nested PCR for immunoglobulin heavy chain or T cell receptor delta gene rearrangements were performed in limiting dilution assays on bone marrow samples taken at diagnosis, at the end of induction therapy and at possible relapse in three children with oligoclonal B-precursor ALL. We demonstrated that in all three patients the subclones were behaving differently in response to therapy. Moreover, in the two patients who relapsed, the clones that grew out during relapse showed the slowest regression or even evoluated during induction therapy and the clones that were not present at relapse showed good response to induction therapy. These results support the hypothesis that at least in some patients already at diagnosis or in the very first weeks, subclones have important differences in respect to resistance. Hence, these data give experimental evidence for the need to develop, during the first months after diagnosis, quantitative PCR assays for at least two different Ig/TCR gene rearrangement targets for every ALL patient.","['de Haas, V', 'Verhagen, O J', 'von dem Borne, A E', 'Kroes, W', 'van den Berg, H', 'van der Schoot, C E']","['de Haas V', 'Verhagen OJ', 'von dem Borne AE', 'Kroes W', 'van den Berg H', 'van der Schoot CE']","['Emma Kinderziekenhuis AMC, University of Amsterdam, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,,IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'B-Lymphocytes/*pathology', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Division', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/pathology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/*pathology', 'Recurrence']",,2001/03/13 10:00,2001/04/03 10:01,['2001/03/13 10:00'],"['2001/03/13 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/04/03 10:01 [medline]', '2001/03/13 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2001 Jan;15(1):134-40. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2401970.,,,['10.1038/sj.leu.2401970 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We used isotype-specific DNA probes for detection of IGL gene rearrangements in 212 B cell malignancies: 76 precursor B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemias (precursor B-ALL), 74 Iglambda+ chronic B cell leukemias (CBL), 34 Iglambda+ non-Hodgkin lymphomas (B-NHL), and 28 Iglambda+ multiple myelomas (MM). The J-Clambda3 gene region was most frequently involved (50%), followed by J-Clambda2 (38%) and J-Clambda1 (9%). There was no involvement of the J-Clambda4 and J-Clambda5 gene regions. Rearrangements to J-Clambda6 (n= 4) were exclusively found in precursor B-ALL (19% of all IGL rearrangements in precursor B-ALL) and only a single J-Clambda7 recombination was detected in an Iglambda+ B-NHL. In the group of Iglambda+ malignancies, a significant shift was observed from predominant J-Clambda3 usage (54%) in mature surface Iglambda+ malignancies (CBL and B-NHL) to 60% J-Clambda2 usage in Iglambda+ secreting MM. The distribution of IGL isotype rearrangements found in MM resembled the Iglambda isotype protein expression reported in MM patients. Based on these extensive Southern blot data, we suggest that a rapid and efficient detection of clonal IGL gene rearrangements can be obtained when a single Bg/II digest is used in combination with the IGLJ2 probe, which detects clonality in >95% of cases with an Iglambda+ malignancy. Higher percentages (>98%) can be reached by including a second digest (HindIII) that reduces the chance of comigration of rearranged and germline bands. In case of precursor B-ALL we recommend including the IGLJ6 probe for the detection of rearrangements to J-Clambda6.","['Tumkaya, T', 'van der Burg, M', 'Garcia Sanz, R', 'Gonzalez Diaz, M', 'Langerak, A W', 'San Miguel, J F', 'van Dongen, J J']","['Tumkaya T', 'van der Burg M', 'Garcia Sanz R', 'Gonzalez Diaz M', 'Langerak AW', 'San Miguel JF', 'van Dongen JJ']","['Department of Immunology, Erasmus University Rotterdam/University Hospital Rotterdam, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,['0 (Immunoglobulin lambda-Chains)'],IM,"['*Gene Rearrangement, B-Lymphocyte, Light Chain', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin lambda-Chains/*genetics', 'Leukemia, B-Cell/*genetics/immunology', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/*genetics/immunology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,2001/03/13 10:00,2001/04/03 10:01,['2001/03/13 10:00'],"['2001/03/13 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/04/03 10:01 [medline]', '2001/03/13 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2001 Jan;15(1):121-7. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2401985.,,,['10.1038/sj.leu.2401985 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

SHIP is expressed as a 145 kDa full-length protein and an isoform of 135 kDa due to alternative splicing. Additional smaller forms of SHIP which are truncated at the carboxy terminus have been described in bone marrow and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). Our data demonstrate that human bone marrow cells and PBMC from healthy donors and patients with acute myeloid leukemia express the 145 kDa form of SHIP and low amounts of a 135 kDa form of SHIP in vivo whereas C-terminal-truncated SHIP proteins are generated by a PMSF-sensitive protease during the preparation of cell lysates in vitro. We have further characterized this protease and identified a proteolytic cleavage site in the human SHIP protein C-terminal to tryptophan residue 941.

Its expression begins at the transition between the proliferative and non-proliferative compartments of myelopoiesis. We studied the effect of targeted disruption of the C/EBPepsilon gene on murine myeloid proliferation and apoptosis. Bone marrow cellularity of C/EBPepsilon -/- and wild-type mice was 95% and 65%, respectively. The C/EBPepsilon -/- mice had an expansion in the number of their CFU-GM/femur. The number of myeloid committed progenitor cells in the peripheral blood and the spleen of these mice was also increased. Bromodeoxyuridine (BrDU) pulse labeling studies demonstrated that the fraction of actively proliferating cells was two-fold higher in the bone marrow of C/EBPepsilon -/- mice. However, the number of myeloid colonies arising from purified Sca-1+/lin- early hematopoietic progenitor cells and from bone marrow mononuclear cells grown in different cytokine combinations was not significantly different between wild-type and knock-out mice. Also, long-term marrow growth, and CFU were not different between the wild-type and C/EBPepsilon -/- mice. The sensitivity to induction of apoptosis in the committed progenitor cell compartment after either withdrawal of growth factor or brief exposure to etoposide was normal. However, Gr-1 antigen-positive C/EBPepsilon -/- granulocytic cells showed an increased rate of apoptosis in comparison to their wild-type counterparts. In summary, the myeloid compartment appears to be expanded in mice lacking C/EBPepsilon. However, this is not the consequence of an intrinsic myeloproliferation but due to an indirect, possibly cytokine-mediated stimulation of myelopoiesis in vivo. C/EBPepsilon may have a role in the inhibition of apoptosis in maturing granulocytic cells.","['Verbeek, W', 'Wachter, M', 'Lekstrom-Himes, J', 'Koeffler, H P']","['Verbeek W', 'Wachter M', 'Lekstrom-Himes J', 'Koeffler HP']","['Division of Hematology, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, Los Angeles, CA 90048, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Cebpe protein, mouse)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/*genetics', 'CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Proteins/*genetics', 'Gene Deletion', 'Homozygote', 'Leukopoiesis/*genetics', 'Mice']",,2001/03/13 10:00,2001/04/03 10:01,['2001/03/13 10:00'],"['2001/03/13 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/04/03 10:01 [medline]', '2001/03/13 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2001 Jan;15(1):103-11. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2401995.,,,['10.1038/sj.leu.2401995 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Phenol and hydroquinone have been strongly implicated in producing leukemia associated with benzene exposure, because they reproduce the hematotoxicity of benzene, cause DNA and chromosomal damage found in leukemia, inhibit topoisomerase II, and alter hematopoiesis and clonal selection. The widely varying background levels of phenol and hydroquinone in control individuals stem mainly from direct dietary ingestion, catabolism of tyrosine and other substrates by gut bacteria, ingestion of arbutin-containing foods, cigarette smoking, and the use of some over-the-counter medicines. We hypothesize that these background sources of phenol and hydroquinone and associated adducts play a causal role in producing some forms of de novo leukemia in the general population. This hypothesis is consistent with recent epidemiological findings associating leukemia with diets rich in meat and protein, the use of antibiotics (which change gastrointestinal flora make-up), lack of breastfeeding, and low activity of NAD(P)H quinone oxidoreductase which detoxifies quinones derived from phenol and hydroquinone and protects against benzene hematotoxicity. An attractive feature of our hypothesis is that it may explain why many people who have no known occupational exposures or significant smoking history develop leukemia. The hypothesis predicts that susceptibility to the disease would be related to diet, medicinal intake, genetics and gut-flora composition. The latter two of these are largely beyond our control, and thus dietary modification and reduced use of medicines that elevate phenol levels may be the best intervention strategies for lowering leukemia risk.","['McDonald, T A', 'Holland, N T', 'Skibola, C', 'Duramad, P', 'Smith, M T']","['McDonald TA', 'Holland NT', 'Skibola C', 'Duramad P', 'Smith MT']",,['eng'],"['Editorial', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Hydroquinones)', '0 (Mutagens)', '0 (Phenols)', 'XV74C1N1AE (hydroquinone)']",IM,"['Diet/adverse effects', 'Digestive System/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Hydroquinones/metabolism/*toxicity', 'Leukemia/*etiology/metabolism', 'Mutagens/metabolism/*toxicity', 'Phenols/metabolism/*toxicity']",108,2001/03/13 10:00,2001/04/03 10:01,['2001/03/13 10:00'],"['2001/03/13 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/04/03 10:01 [medline]', '2001/03/13 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2001 Jan;15(1):10-20. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2401981.,,,['10.1038/sj.leu.2401981 [doi]'],,"['P42 ES004705/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States', 'P42ES04705/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01ES06721/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Loss in Rb function is, in most cases, a result of the phosphorylation and inactivation of Rb by the cyclin-dependent kinases (cdks), main regulators of cell cycle progression. Flavopiridol, the first cdk modulator tested in clinical trials, is a flavonoid that inhibits several cdks with evidence of cell cycle block. Other interesting preclinical features are the induction of apoptosis, promotion of differentiation, inhibition of angiogenic processes and modulation of transcriptional events. Initial clinical trials with infusional flavopiridol demonstrated activity in some patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, renal, prostate, colon and gastric carcinomas. Main side-effects were secretory diarrhea and a pro-inflammatory syndrome associated with hypotension. Phase 2 trials with infusional flavopiridol in CLL and mantle cell lymphoma, other schedules and combination with standard chemotherapies are ongoing. The second cdk modulator tested in clinical trials, UCN-01, is a potent protein kinase C inhibitor that inhibits cdk activity in vitro as well. UCN-01 blocks cell cycle progression and promotes apoptosis in hematopoietic models. Moreover, UCN-01 is able to abrogate checkpoints induced by genotoxic stress due to modulation in chk1 kinase. The first clinical trial of UCN-01 demonstrated very prolonged half-life (approximately 600 h), 100 times longer than the half-life observed in preclinical models. This effect is due to high binding affinity of UCN-01 to the human plasma protein alpha-1-acid glycoprotein. Main side-effects in this trial were headaches, nausea/vomiting, hypoxemia and hyperglycemia. Clinical activity was observed in patients with melanoma, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and leiomyosarcoma. Of interest, a patient with anaplastic large cell lymphoma refractory to high-dose chemotherapy showed no evidence of disease after 3 years of UCN-01 therapy. Trials of infusional UCN-01 in combination with Ara-C or gemcitabine in patients with acute leukemia and CLL, respectively, have commenced. In conclusion, flavopiridol and UCN-01 are cdk modulators that reach biologically active concentrations effective in modulating CDK in vitro, and show encouraging results in early clinical trials in patients with refractory hematopoietic malignancies. Although important questions remain to be answered, these positive experiences will hopefully increase the therapeutic modalities in hematological malignancies.","['Senderowicz, A M']",['Senderowicz AM'],"['Oral and Pharyngeal Cancer Branch, National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892-4340, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Alkaloids)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Flavonoids)', '0 (Piperidines)', '0 (Retinoblastoma Protein)', '45AD6X575G (alvocidib)', '7BU5H4V94A (7-hydroxystaurosporine)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinases)', 'H88EPA0A3N (Staurosporine)']",IM,"['Alkaloids/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Flavonoids/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Humans', 'Piperidines/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Retinoblastoma Protein/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Staurosporine/analogs & derivatives']",100,2001/03/13 10:00,2001/04/03 10:01,['2001/03/13 10:00'],"['2001/03/13 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/04/03 10:01 [medline]', '2001/03/13 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2001 Jan;15(1):1-9. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2401994.,,,['10.1038/sj.leu.2401994 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The 174 late side-effects included endocrine disorders (19%), cognitive impairment (14%), orthopedic dysfunction (12%), alopecia (12%), dental damage (11%), psychological (8%) and neurological (8%) disturbances, and azoospermia or amenorrhea (5%). There was no cardiac or renal damage and no second malignancy. 29% of side-effects were severe. There was significant reduction in quality of life in 54 (49%), in 27 of whom it was severe enough to require psychological intervention. Treatment of brain tumor caused 98 late side-effects in 28 patients (sequelae-to-patient ratio [SPR] 3.3). Most cognitive, endocrine and neurological disorders, and most cases of alopecia, dental and psychological difficulties were in these patients. There were frequent late complications in those treated for retinoblastoma (SPR 1.8), and bone or soft tissue sarcomas (SPR 0.8). Those treated for Wilm's tumor had few side-effects (SPR 0.4). Late side effects were most frequent after radiation, reaching as high as SPR 2.4. It averaged only 0.5 in those treated with chemotherapy alone or in combination with surgery. Reduction of late side-effects in these patients requires using less toxic modalities, as long as cure rate is not compromised.

Although mixed chimerism(MC) is not necessarily a poor prognostic factor, several groups have suggested that MC is associated with an increased risk of disease relapse. There is evidence that patients with MC benefit from additional immunotherapy if the treatment is started in minimal residual disease status(mixed chimerism status), not in frank hematological relapse. The purposes of this study are to evaluate 1) the risk for relapse or graft rejection in correlation to persistent MC status after allo-BMT, and 2) the possibility of preventing relapse by immune modulation treatments (withdrawal or rapid taper-off of post-transplant immuno-suppression, additional interferon treatment, or the administration of donor lymphocytes) in hematologic malignancies. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Of 337 allogeneic donor-recipient pairs between March 1996 and August 1998, 12 patients who showed persistent or progressive MC and who received immune modulation treatments were evaluated. Twelve patients, median age 31 years(range 9 to 39 years), received an allo-BMT for: acute myelogenous leukemia(AML, n = 5), chronic myelogenous leukemia(CML, n = 4), acute lymphocytic leukemia(ALL, n = 3). Serial polymerase chain reaction(PCR) analysis of YNZ 22-, 33.6-minisatellites or Y chromosome-specific PCR analysis at short term intervals(pre- and post-transplant 1, 3, 6, 9, ... months) was performed. Once MC was detected, immune modulation treatments on the basis of increasing MC in an early phase of recurrence of underlying disease were started. RESULTS: Nine of 12 patients converted to complete chimerism(CC) (AML 5/5, CML 3/4, ALL 1/3). Four of 9 CC patients developed graft-versus-host disease(GVHD) grade < or = 2 during immune modulation. All were treated successfully with steroids. Three patients who were not converted to CC showed relapse of underlying diseases or graft failure. CONCLUSION: The results demonstrate that, in patients with hematologic malignancies after allo-BMT, persistent MC is associated with relapse of underlying diseases or graft failure. Furthermore, when patients receive early immune modulation treatment, MC can be changed to complete donor pattern chimerism and ultimately prevent relapse.","['Park, S J', 'Min, W S', 'Yang, I H', 'Kim, H J', 'Min, C K', 'Eom, H S', 'Kim, D W', 'Han, C W', 'Lee, J W', 'Kim, C C']","['Park SJ', 'Min WS', 'Yang IH', 'Kim HJ', 'Min CK', 'Eom HS', 'Kim DW', 'Han CW', 'Lee JW', 'Kim CC']","['Catholic Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation Center, College of Medicine, Catholic University, Seoul, Korea.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Korea (South),Korean J Intern Med,The Korean journal of internal medicine,8712418,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/*immunology', 'Child', 'Chimera', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease/*etiology', 'Histocompatibility Testing', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/mortality/*therapy', 'Male', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Polymorphism, Restriction Fragment Length', 'Recurrence', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",,2001/03/13 10:00,2001/03/27 10:01,['2001/03/13 10:00'],"['2001/03/13 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/27 10:01 [medline]', '2001/03/13 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Korean J Intern Med. 2000 Dec;15(3):224-31. doi: 10.3904/kjim.2000.15.3.224.,,,['10.3904/kjim.2000.15.3.224 [doi]'],PMC4531771,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The disease course and response to treatment were compatible with the type and stage of lymphoma. No unusually aggressive behavior was noted in any case. A control group of 59 cases of benign lymph nodes analyzed during the same period showed no aberrant expression of T-cell-associated antigens; thus, such expression is not a feature of benign lymphoid proliferations. Study of these B-cell lymphomas may prove invaluable to study aberrant activation of silent or repressed T-cell differentiation genes. CD2-expressing B-cell NHLs may represent clonal expansion of CD2+ B lymphocytes that normally constitute a small fraction of peripheral B lymphocytes and should not be confused with composite B- and T-cell lymphomas.

Identification of the latter has often failed, owing to the very selective demands for lymphoblast culture. Nevertheless, the risk-adapted and very intensive antileukaemic therapy has been a success, with cure rates as high as 75-80 per cent. However, a large fraction of these patients are overtreated. A more individualiZed tailoring of the therapy is expected to be available through: 1) A series of new and more direct techniques to reveal chromosomal aberrations; 2) exploration of the in vitro drug sensitivity of the malignant clone; 3) detailed monitoring of the minimal residual disease down to the level of one leukaemic cell in 10,000-100,000 normal bone marrow cells; 4) therapeutic drug monitoring and individual dose adjustments; and 5) mapping of the individual patient's risk of serious or even life-threatening side effects. It is likely that these approaches would allow a reduction in the treatment intensity for most patients, thereby reducing the risk of serious toxicity, and concomitantly improve identification of those patients for whom standard therapy is likely to fail and who are thus candidates for stem cell transplantion or experimental therapy in first remission.","['Schmiegelow, K']",['Schmiegelow K'],"['H:S Righospitalet, Juliane Marie Centret, paediatrisk klinik II. rh02133@rh.dk']",['dan'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",Denmark,Ugeskr Laeger,Ugeskrift for laeger,0141730,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Child', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Humans', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/genetics/immunology', 'Risk Factors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",41,2001/03/13 10:00,2001/04/21 10:01,['2001/03/13 10:00'],"['2001/03/13 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/04/21 10:01 [medline]', '2001/03/13 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Ugeskr Laeger. 2001 Feb 19;163(8):1062-6.,Individualiseret kraeftbehandling.

With regard to change in diagnostic criteria for ML, the geographical distribution of ML death rates by subtype shows variation over the last 20 years. In Japan, ML is more prevalent in southwestern districts, attributed to ATL caused by HTLV-I, and this high incidence of ATL should disappear with the HTLV-I eradication in the future.

CONCLUSIONS: It is therefore important to identify patients who are at a high risk of developing ATLS so that additional measures can be taken to prevent it from occurring.","['Chuah, C T', 'Lim, L C']","['Chuah CT', 'Lim LC']","['Department of Haematology, Singapore General Hospital, 1 Hospital Drive, Singapore 169608.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",Singapore,Ann Acad Med Singap,"Annals of the Academy of Medicine, Singapore",7503289,"['5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/administration & dosage/*adverse effects', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/*diagnosis/*drug therapy', 'Cyclophosphamide/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Fatal Outcome', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Tumor Lysis Syndrome/*etiology/therapy', 'Vincristine/administration & dosage/adverse effects']",,2001/03/13 10:00,2001/06/19 10:01,['2001/03/13 10:00'],"['2001/03/13 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/06/19 10:01 [medline]', '2001/03/13 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Ann Acad Med Singap. 2001 Jan;30(1):55-7.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The focus of this report is on PV, which is characterized by an increase in red blood cells, granulocytes, and platelets. Complications associated with PV are an increased risk of thrombosis and abnormal bleeding. Phlebotomy to a hematocrit less than 45% is the mainstay of treatment for erythrocythemia, but may further increase the platelet count, necessitating the use of a platelet-lowering agent in conjunction with phlebotomy. Other treatment strategies include low-dose aspirin or other antithrombotic therapy and cytoreduction. Mounting evidence of the leukemogenicity and mutagenicity of radioactive phosphorus and alkylating agents, as administered using ""conventional"" regimens, has restricted the liberal use of these treatments. Three drugs have emerged as useful because of their efficacy in reducing the elevated platelet count: anagrelide, hydroxyurea (HU), and interferon alfa (IFN). It is clear that no single agent satisfies all the needs for cytoreduction that arise during the course of PV. Future protocols should be designed that draw on the large body of experience already gained with these drugs to transcend the limitations of single-agent therapy and to improve quality of life as well as survival.

Given profiling data from two types of samples, genes that most distinguish the samples (marker genes) are good candidates for subsequent in-depth experimental studies and developing decision support systems for diagnosis, prognosis, and monitoring. This work proposes a mixture of feature relevance experts as a method for identifying marker genes and illustrates the idea using published data from samples labeled as acute lymphoblastic and myeloid leukemia (ALL, AML). A feature relevance expert implements an algorithm that calculates how well a gene distinguishes samples, reorders genes according to this relevance measure, and uses a supervised learning method [here, support vector machines (SVMs)] to determine the generalization performances of different nested gene subsets. The mixture of three feature relevance experts examined implement two existing and one novel feature relevance measures. For each expert, a gene subset consisting of the top 50 genes distinguished ALL from AML samples as completely as all 7,070 genes. The 125 genes at the union of the top 50s are plausible markers for a prototype decision support system. Chromosomal aberration and other data support the prediction that the three genes at the intersection of the top 50s, cystatin C, azurocidin, and adipsin, are good targets for investigating the basic biology of ALL/AML. The same data were employed to identify markers that distinguish samples based on their labels of T cell/B cell, peripheral blood/bone marrow, and male/female. Selenoprotein W may discriminate T cells from B cells. Results from analysis of transcription profiling data from tumor/nontumor colon adenocarcinoma samples support the general utility of the aforementioned approach. Theoretical issues such as choosing SVM kernels and their parameters, training and evaluating feature relevance experts, and the impact of potentially mislabeled samples on marker identification (feature selection) are discussed.","['Chow, M L', 'Moler, E J', 'Mian, I S']","['Chow ML', 'Moler EJ', 'Mian IS']","['Radiation Biology and Environmental Toxicology Group, Department of Cell Biology, Life Sciences Division, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, Berkeley, California 94720, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Physiol Genomics,Physiological genomics,9815683,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Genetic Markers)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adenocarcinoma/diagnosis/genetics', 'Algorithms', 'B-Lymphocytes/metabolism', 'Bayes Theorem', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*genetics', 'Bone Marrow Cells/metabolism', 'Child', 'Chromosome Aberrations/genetics', 'Computational Biology/methods', 'Data Interpretation, Statistical', 'Female', '*Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Genetic Markers/genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/diagnosis/*genetics', 'Male', 'Organ Specificity', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/diagnosis/*genetics', 'RNA, Neoplasm/analysis/genetics', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Sex Characteristics', 'T-Lymphocytes/metabolism', 'Transcription, Genetic/*genetics']",,2001/03/10 10:00,2001/06/23 10:01,['2001/03/10 10:00'],"['2001/03/10 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/06/23 10:01 [medline]', '2001/03/10 10:00 [entrez]']",epublish,Physiol Genomics. 2001 Mar 8;5(2):99-111. doi: 10.1152/physiolgenomics.2001.5.2.99.,,,"['5/2/99 [pii]', '10.1152/physiolgenomics.2001.5.2.99 [doi]']",,,,,,,20010308,,,,,,,

The current murine retrovirus-based gene transfer systems require dividing cells for efficient transduction, and therefore the target HSCs must be activated ex vivo by cytokines to cycle, which may limit their engrafting ability. Lentivirus-based gene transfer systems do not require cell division and, thus, may allow for efficient gene transfer to human HSCs in the absence of any ex vivo cytokine stimulation. We constructed human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-based vectors and compared them in vitro and in vivo with MuLV-based vectors in their ability to transduce unstimulated human CD34(+) HSCs isolated from mobilized peripheral blood. Both sets of vectors contained the marker gene that expresses the enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) for evaluating transduction efficiency and were pseudotyped with either vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein (VSV-G) or the amphotropic murine leukemia virus envelope (A-MULV Env). The VSV-G-pseudotyped HIV-based vectors containing an internal mouse phosphoglycerate kinase promoter (PGK) were able to transduce up to 48% of the unstimulated CD34(+) cells as measured by EGFP expression. When these cells were injected into the human fetal thymus implants of irradiated SCID-hu Thy/Liv mice, up to 18% expressed EGFP after 8 weeks in vivo. In contrast, the MULV-based vectors were effective at transducing HSCs only in the presence of cytokines. Our results demonstrate that the improved HIV-based gene transfer system can effectively transduce unstimulated human CD34(+) HSCs, which can then differentiate into thymocytes and provide long-term transgene expression in vivo.","['Douglas, J L', 'Lin, W Y', 'Panis, M L', 'Veres, G']","['Douglas JL', 'Lin WY', 'Panis ML', 'Veres G']","['SyStemix, Palo Alto, CA 94304, USA.

To examine the value of fetal CB for gene therapy of inborn immunohematopoietic disorders, we tested the feasibility of genetic modification of CD34(+) cells from CB at weeks 24 to 34 of pregnancy, using lentiviral vector-mediated transfer of the green fluorescent protein (GFP) gene. The transduction rate of CD34(+) cells was 42 +/- 9%, resulting in GFP expression in 23 +/- 4% of colonies derived from colony-forming units (CFUs) and 11 +/- 1% from primitive long-term culture-initiating cells (LTC-ICs). Cell cycle analysis demonstrated transduction and GFP expression in cells in the G(0) phase, which contains immature hematopoietic progenitors. Transduced fetal CD34(+) cells could be expanded 1000-fold in long-term cultures supplemented with megakaryocyte growth and development factor along with Flt-3 ligand. At week 10, expression of GFP was observed in 40.5 +/- 11.7% of CFU-derived colonies. While prestimulation of CD34(+) cells with cytokines prior to transduction increased the efficiency of GFP transfer 2- to 3-fold, long-term maintenance of GFP-expressing CFUs occurred only in the absence of prestimulation. The GFP gene was found integrated into the genomic DNA of 35% of LTC-IC-derived colonies initiated at week 10, but GFP expression was not detectable, suggesting downregulation of transgene activity during the extended culture period. These results indicate that human fetal CB progenitors are amenable to genetic modification by lentiviral vectors and may serve as a target for gene therapy of hematopoietic disorders by prenatal autologous transplantation.","['Luther-Wyrsch, A', 'Costello, E', 'Thali, M', 'Buetti, E', 'Nissen, C', 'Surbek, D', 'Holzgreve, W', 'Gratwohl, A', 'Tichelli, A', 'Wodnar-Filipowicz, A']","['Luther-Wyrsch A', 'Costello E', 'Thali M', 'Buetti E', 'Nissen C', 'Surbek D', 'Holzgreve W', 'Gratwohl A', 'Tichelli A', 'Wodnar-Filipowicz A']","['Department of Research, University Hospital Basel, CH-4031 Basel, Switzerland.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Hum Gene Ther,Human gene therapy,9008950,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (Growth Substances)', '0 (Luminescent Proteins)', '147336-22-9 (Green Fluorescent Proteins)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD34/genetics/metabolism', 'Cell Cycle/physiology', 'DNA Primers/chemistry', 'Female', 'Fetal Blood/*cytology', 'Gene Amplification', 'Genetic Vectors', 'Green Fluorescent Proteins', 'Growth Substances/metabolism', 'HIV-1/*genetics', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Infant, Premature/*blood', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/genetics', 'Luminescent Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Pregnancy', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Transduction, Genetic/*methods']",,2001/03/10 10:00,2001/05/05 10:01,['2001/03/10 10:00'],"['2001/03/10 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/05/05 10:01 [medline]', '2001/03/10 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Hum Gene Ther. 2001 Mar 1;12(4):377-89. doi: 10.1089/10430340150504000.,,,['10.1089/10430340150504000 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The host range of a vector is therefore determined largely by the receptor specificity of the fusion protein contained in the outer viral envelope. Previous attempts to generate targeted retroviral vectors have included the addition of targeting ligands to the murine leukemia virus envelope protein (MuLV Env). Although such proteins frequently display modified cell-binding characteristics, the interaction with the targeted receptors fails to trigger virus-cell fusion. Here, we report the use of a binding-defective but fusion-competent hemagglutinin (HA) protein to complement the fusion defect in a chimeric MuLV Env targeted to the Flt-3 receptor. Retroviral vectors containing both proteins showed enhanced transduction of cells expressing Flt-3, which was abrogated by preincubating the target cells with soluble Flt-3 ligand. Furthermore, the fusion function of HA was absolutely required. These data demonstrate that it is possible to separate the binding and fusion events of retroviral entry, using two separate proteins, and suggest that varying the binding protein component in this scheme may allow a general strategy for targeting retroviral vectors.","['Lin, A H', 'Kasahara, N', 'Wu, W', 'Stripecke, R', 'Empig, C L', 'Anderson, W F', 'Cannon, P M']","['Lin AH', 'Kasahara N', 'Wu W', 'Stripecke R', 'Empig CL', 'Anderson WF', 'Cannon PM']","['Gene Therapy Laboratories, Norris Cancer Center, University of Southern California Keck School of Medicine, Los Angeles, CA 90033, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Hum Gene Ther,Human gene therapy,9008950,"['0 (Gene Products, env)', '0 (Hemagglutinin Glycoproteins, Influenza Virus)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Virus)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Flt3 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)']",IM,"['3T3 Cells', 'Animals', 'Binding Sites/genetics', 'Cell Line', 'Gene Products, env/*genetics', 'Gene Targeting', 'Genetic Vectors', 'Hemagglutinin Glycoproteins, Influenza Virus/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*genetics', '*Membrane Fusion', 'Mice', 'Mutation', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/metabolism', 'Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/metabolism', 'Receptors, Virus/*physiology', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/genetics', 'Retroviridae/*genetics', 'Viral Envelope Proteins/*chemistry', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3']",,2001/03/10 10:00,2001/05/05 10:01,['2001/03/10 10:00'],"['2001/03/10 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/05/05 10:01 [medline]', '2001/03/10 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Hum Gene Ther. 2001 Mar 1;12(4):323-32. doi: 10.1089/10430340150503957.,,,['10.1089/10430340150503957 [doi]'],,['CA-59318/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,

Its protective role against HTLV-1 infection in animal models is well established, suggesting that recombinant envelope glycoproteins or synthetic peptides could be used as an effective vaccine. However, reports have indicated that some variations in envelope sequences may induce incomplete cross-neutralization between HTLV-1 strains. To identify amino acid changes that might be involved in induction of specific neutralizing antibodies, we studied sera from three patients (2085, 2555, and 2709) infected by HTLV-1 with surface glycoprotein gp46 harboring variations in amino acid sequence at positions 39, 72, 265, and 290. Inhibition of syncytia induced by parental, chimeric, or point-mutated envelope proteins indicated that sera 2555 and 2709 primarily recognized neutralizable epitopes located in N- and C-terminal parts of the gp46 glycoprotein. Amino acids changes at positions 39, 265, and 290 greatly impaired recognition of neutralizing epitopes recognized by these two sera. These results demonstrate that amino acid changes in envelope glycoprotein gp46 can induce strain-specific neutralizing antibodies in some patients. On the other hand, the neutralizing activity of serum 2085 was not affected by amino acid changes at positions 39, 265, and 290, suggesting that the neutralizing antibodies present in this serum were directed against epitopes located in other parts of the molecule, possibly those located in the central domain of the molecule, which has the same amino acid sequence in the three viruses.","['Tallet, B', 'Astier-Gin, T', 'Moynet, D', 'Londos-Gagliardi, D', 'Guillemain, B']","['Tallet B', 'Astier-Gin T', 'Moynet D', 'Londos-Gagliardi D', 'Guillemain B']","['Laboratoire de Virologie and CNRS-UMR5097, Universite Victor Segalen Bordeaux 2, 33076 Bordeaux cedex, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,AIDS Res Hum Retroviruses,AIDS research and human retroviruses,8709376,"['0 (Gene Products, env)', '0 (HTLV-I Antibodies)', '0 (HTLV-I Antigens)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Retroviridae Proteins, Oncogenic)', '0 (gp46 protein, Human T-cell leukemia virus type I)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Gene Products, env/*chemistry/genetics/*immunology', 'Genetic Variation/*genetics', 'Giant Cells/physiology', 'HTLV-I Antibodies/*blood/immunology', 'HTLV-I Antigens/immunology', 'HTLV-I Infections/immunology/virology', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutation', 'Neutralization Tests', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Retroviridae Proteins, Oncogenic/*chemistry/genetics/*immunology', 'Transfection']",,2001/03/10 10:00,2001/07/13 10:01,['2001/03/10 10:00'],"['2001/03/10 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/07/13 10:01 [medline]', '2001/03/10 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,AIDS Res Hum Retroviruses. 2001 Mar 1;17(4):337-48. doi: 10.1089/08892220150503708.,,,['10.1089/08892220150503708 [doi]'],,,,,,['GENBANK/AF250200'],,,,,,,,

METHOD: Retrospective analysis of serial chest radiographs was performed to see the frequency of the crescent sign in 21 consecutive patients with pathologically proved invasive pulmonary aspergillosis. The appearance of the crescent sign was correlated with the pattern of parenchymal lesions on initial CT scans, the presence and duration of neutropenia, and underlying diseases. RESULTS: The crescent sign was seen in 10 of 21 patients (48%) on follow-up radiographic examinations. It was seen in patients with initially large [consolidation or mass; 9/11 (82%) patients] rather than small [nodule(s); 1/10 (10%) patients] parenchymal lesions (p = 0.002) on CT. The sign appeared in 7 of 17 (41%) patients with neutropenia 1-10 days after recovery from neutropenia. It appeared in three of four patients (75%) without neutropenia 4--8 days after treatment with amphotericin B. The appearance was not related to the duration (32 days in patients with crescent sign and 17 days without sign) of the neutropenic period (p > 0.05). The sign was seen in 8 of 15 (53%) patients with acute myelogenous leukemia and 2 of 6 (33%) patients with other diseases (p > 0.05). CONCLUSION: The crescent sign appears in about half of patients with invasive pulmonary aspergillosis with recovery from neutropenia, especially when the initial lesion is a consolidation or mass on CT scans.","['Kim, M J', 'Lee, K S', 'Kim, J', 'Jung, K J', 'Lee, H G', 'Kim, T S']","['Kim MJ', 'Lee KS', 'Kim J', 'Jung KJ', 'Lee HG', 'Kim TS']","['Department of Radiology, Samsung Medical Center, Sungkyunkwan University School of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Comput Assist Tomogr,Journal of computer assisted tomography,7703942,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aspergillosis/blood/*diagnostic imaging', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunocompromised Host', 'Lung/*diagnostic imaging', 'Lung Diseases, Fungal/blood/*diagnostic imaging', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neutropenia/complications', 'Retrospective Studies', '*Tomography, X-Ray Computed']",,2001/03/10 10:00,2001/04/06 10:01,['2001/03/10 10:00'],"['2001/03/10 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/04/06 10:01 [medline]', '2001/03/10 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Comput Assist Tomogr. 2001 Mar-Apr;25(2):305-10. doi: 10.1097/00004728-200103000-00027.,,,"['00004728-200103000-00027 [pii]', '10.1097/00004728-200103000-00027 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In leukemia, where JTs have been predominantly observed, the donor segment (usually 1q) preferentially fuses to the telomere regions of recipient chromosomes. In this study, spectral karyotyping (SKY) and FISH analysis revealed 188 JTs and SJTs in 10 cell lines derived from carcinomas of the bladder, prostate, breast, cervix, and pancreas. Multiple JTs and SJTs were detected in each cell line and contributed to recurrent unbalanced whole-arm translocations involving chromosome arms 5p, 14q, 15q, 20q, and 21q. Sixty percent (113/188) of JT breakpoints occurred within centromere or pericentromeric regions of the recipient chromosomes, whereas only 12% of the breakpoints were located in the telomere regions. JT breakpoints of both donor and recipient chromosomes coincided with numerous fragile sites as well as viral integration sites for human DNA viruses. The JTs within each tumor cell line promoted clonal progression, leading to the acquisition of extra copies of the donated chromosome segments that often contained oncogenes (MYC, ABL, HER2/NEU, etc.), consequently resulting in tumor-specific genomic imbalances.

It acts to transport Akt1 to the nucleus and enhance Akt1's serine-threonine kinase activity. TCL1 is also expressed in the B-cell malignancy, Burkitt's lymphoma (BL). However, 14q32.1 breakpoints have not been detected in BL, and we therefore investigated in more detail how expression was activated. No evidence for rearrangement near TCL1 was found in BL. Instead, a NotI site adjacent to the TATA box in the TCL1 promoter was found to be unmethylated. By contrast, tumor cell lines not expressing TCL1 were fully methylated at this NotI site, while normal somatic cells were hemimethylated. We also found that TCL1 was expressed in B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and the related disorder splenic lymphoma with villous lymphocytes (unlike in normal mature B-cells), and that the NotI site was unmethylated on both alleles. This correlation of repression and methylation was tested in vitro. When cells with both alleles methylated at the NotI site were demethylated, TCL1 expression was induced. These data provide evidence that in mature B-cell malignancies there is an alternative mechanism of TCL1 activation that apparently involves loss of methylation of one promoter allele. We discuss the significance of this for CLL tumorigenesis and for genomewide hypomethylation in CLL.","['Yuille, M R', 'Condie, A', 'Stone, E M', 'Wilsher, J', 'Bradshaw, P S', 'Brooks, L', 'Catovsky, D']","['Yuille MR', 'Condie A', 'Stone EM', 'Wilsher J', 'Bradshaw PS', 'Brooks L', 'Catovsky D']","['Academic Department of Haematology and Cytogenetics, Institute of Cancer Research, Sutton Surrey SM2 5NG, UK. myuille@icr.ac.uk']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Genes Chromosomes Cancer,"Genes, chromosomes & cancer",9007329,"['0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (TCL1A protein, human)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 14/*genetics', '*DNA Methylation', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/*genetics', 'Gene Rearrangement/*genetics', '*Genes, Neoplasm', 'HT29 Cells', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/biosynthesis/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,2001/03/10 10:00,2001/05/22 10:01,['2001/03/10 10:00'],"['2001/03/10 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/05/22 10:01 [medline]', '2001/03/10 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Genes Chromosomes Cancer. 2001 Apr;30(4):336-41. doi: 10.1002/gcc.1099.,,"['Copyright 2001 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",['10.1002/gcc.1099 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Our recent work showed that chronic (>18 wk), low-level (125-500 nM) arsenite exposure induces malignant transformation in normal rat liver cell line TRL1215. In these arsenic-transformed cells, thecellular S-adenosylmethionine pool was depleted from arsenic metabolism, resulting in global DNA hypomethylation. DNA methylation status in turn may affect the expression of a variety of genes. This study examined the aberrant gene expression associated with arsenic-induced transformation with the use of Atlas Rat cDNA Expression microarrays. Poly(A(+)) RNA was prepared from arsenic-transformed cells and passage-matched control cells, and (32)P-labeled cDNA probes were synthesized with Clontech Rat cDNA Synthesis primers and moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase. The hybrid intensity was analyzed with AtlasImage software and normalized with the sum of the four housekeeping genes. Four hybridizations from separate cell preparations were performed, and mean and SEM for the expression of each gene were calculated for statistical analysis. Among the 588 genes, approximately 80 genes ( approximately 13%) were aberrantly expressed. These included genes involved in cell-cycle regulation, signal transduction, stress response, apoptosis, cytokine production and growth-factor and hormone-receptor production and various oncogenes. These initial gene expression analyses for the first time showed potentially important aberrant gene expression patterns associated with arsenic-induced malignant transformation and set the stage for numerous further studies.

Increased apoptosis has been noted in MDS as a possible explanation for ineffective hematopoiesis, with lower levels in progression to and in de novo acute leukemia. Apoptosis can be measured by binding of Annexin V to exposed membrane phosphatidylserine. We postulated that the apoptotic index would aid in the differential diagnosis of MDS versus other hematopoietic diseases. We examined 33 bone marrow aspirates suspected of hematopoietic malignancy for apoptotic index by Annexin V analysis using a Becton Dickinson FACStar+ flow cytometer. The apoptotic index was expressed as the percentage of Annexin V-positive cells divided by total mononuclear cells in the gate. By standard morphologic analysis, 16 cases were diagnosed as MDS (9 refractory anemia [RA], 2 refractory anemia with ringed sideroblasts [RARS], 1 refractory anemia with excess of blasts [RAEB], 3 chronic myelomonocytic leukemia [CMML], and 1 unclassified), 11 as acute leukemia (AL), 6 as myeloproliferative disorders (MPD). Eight cases (uninvolved marrow of five patients with lymphoproliferative disorders [LPD], one patient with multiple myeloma, and two patients with anemia of chronic disease) served as nonneoplastic controls. A higher degree of apoptosis was observed in MDS (mean = 44.7%; range = 29.5--60%) compared with MPD (mean = 8.2%; range = 2.3--15.4%), AL (mean = 16.1%; range = 5.1--29.4%), and control marrow samples (mean = 11.6%; range = 1.5--21%). Additionally, the apoptotic index was significantly higher in MDS compared with MPD (P < 0.0001). In conclusion, a high apoptotic index occurs in MDS, supporting previous reports and suggesting that Annexin V analysis can be used as an adjunct in the diagnosis of MDS versus MPD. This would be particularly useful for the often-difficult distinction between early MDS and early MPD cases with equivocal morphology.","['Merchant, S H', 'Gonchoroff, N J', 'Hutchison, R E']","['Merchant SH', 'Gonchoroff NJ', 'Hutchison RE']","['Department of Pathology, State University of New York, Upstate Medical University, Syracuse, New York 13210, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Cytometry,Cytometry,8102328,"['0 (Annexin A5)', '0 (Phosphatidylserines)']",IM,"['Annexin A5/chemistry', '*Apoptosis', 'Biopsy', 'Bone Marrow Cells/chemistry/*pathology', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Flow Cytometry/*methods', 'Humans', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*diagnosis/pathology', 'Phosphatidylserines/chemistry/metabolism']",,2001/03/10 10:00,2001/05/05 10:01,['2001/03/10 10:00'],"['2001/03/10 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/05/05 10:01 [medline]', '2001/03/10 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cytometry. 2001 Feb 15;46(1):28-32. doi: 10.1002/1097-0320(20010215)46:1<28::aid-cyto1034>3.0.co;2-h.,,"['Copyright 2001 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']","['10.1002/1097-0320(20010215)46:1<28::AID-CYTO1034>3.0.CO;2-H [pii]', '10.1002/1097-0320(20010215)46:1<28::aid-cyto1034>3.0.co;2-h [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A questionnaire was distributed prior to the meeting to numerous experts from US and European institutions and 13 responses were received. At the meeting, 25 individuals, including most of those who returned responses, participated in the discussions and voted on the issues presented. In chronic lymphoproliferative disorders (CLD), 9 antibodies (anti-CD5, CD19, kappa, lambda, CD3, CD20, CD23, CD10, and CD45) were deemed essential for initial evaluation by 75% of the participants. There was near unanimity that additional markers (selected from CD22, FMC7, CD11c, CD103, CD38, CD25, CD79b and heavy chains for B-cell disorders, and CD4, CD7, CD8, CD2, CD56, CD16, TCRa/b, and TCRg/d for T-cell disorders) would be needed to fully characterize CLD, although not every marker would be useful in all cases. Tissue lymphomas were believed to be similar to CLD, needing a minimum of 12--16 markers. However, for some cases, CD30, bcl-2, TdT, CD71, CD1a, and CD34 were cited as useful by the participants. Markers mentioned for plasma cell disorders included kappa, lambda, CD38, CD45, CD56, CD19, CD20, CD138, and heavy chains. Of 17 voting participants, 16 agreed that between 5 to 8 markers would be essential reagents for plasma cell disorders. For acute leukemia (AL), 10 markers (CD10, CD19, CD13, CD33, CD34, CD45, CD7, CD14, CD3, and HLADR) were considered essential by 75% of participants for initial characterization of the leukemia lineage. Most (>75%) agreed that at least one more B (CD20, CD22, CD79a, IgM), T (CD1a, CD2, CD4, CD5, CD8), myeloid (CD11b, CD15, CD64, CD117, myeloperoxidase), erythroid (CD36, CD71, glycophorin A), and megakaryocytic (CD41, CD61) reagents should be included in the essential panel. However, there was no agreement as to which was optimal. Thus, approximately 13--15 of those reagents would be considered essential in all cases of AL, whereas others (CD16, CD56, CDw65, TdT, and cytoplasmic CD3) were mentioned as useful in some cases. Almost all voting participants believed that the appropriate number of markers for complete characterization of AL would average 20--24. The majority of the responders (11 of 13) indicated that fewer reagents could be used in monitoring or staging patients with previously characterized disease, but not all ventured a specific number of reagents. From the above results, we conclude that the phenotypic analysis of hematologic and lymphoid neoplasia requires a rather extensive panel of reagents. Supplementary reagents might even be necessary if they prove to become relevant for diagnostic purposes. Reducing the number of antibodies could significantly compromise the diagnostic accuracy, appropriate monitoring, or therapy of these disorders.","['Braylan, R C', 'Orfao, A', 'Borowitz, M J', 'Davis, B H']","['Braylan RC', 'Orfao A', 'Borowitz MJ', 'Davis BH']","['Department of Pathology, University of Florida, Gainesville, Florida 32610, USA.

RESULTS: The two methods seemed to be equivalent concerning distress, discomfort, pain, well-being and security after the procedure, and procedure problems. Most children (80%), parents (66%), and nurses (58%) preferred LP in CS. However, the LP was not performed in CS in five cases because the child did not cooperate. Younger children less often preferred CS. CONCLUSIONS: Outcomes for CS and GA in LP were similar. Although there were failures with the CS model, most preferred it to GA. LP in CS also saved time and medical resources.

No population-based studies have been carried out. We studied all children with ALL presenting over 5 years within a defined population to determine its clinical importance. PROCEDURE: Patients were investigated for the presence of unique clonal rearrangements of IgH and T-cell receptor genes. Unique patient specific probes were used to detect, by polymerase chain reaction, the presence of clonal markers indicating MRD in mononuclear cells obtained from marrow samples at 1, 3, 5, and 24 months. The effect of MRD on event-free survival was determined. RESULTS: Seventy-seven of 120 children with ALL had informative markers and samples of remission marrow suitable for testing. Presence or absence of MRD did not significantly affect outcome. Gender (P < 0.04) and white cell count (P < 0.04) were independent prognostic factors. Analysis of only those cases with detectable MRD showed that cases with one blast per 100 mononuclear cells, or more, 28 days after starting treatment did worse than those with lower levels (hazard ratio 7.77, P < 0.02). CONCLUSIONS: Mere presence or absence of MRD is probably too crude a measure to be useful and worse than other standard prognostic indicators. A threshold of 10(-2) blasts at 28 days might be discriminatory, but should not be over-interpreted. The number of patients available for this analysis (31) was small, the threshold and sampling points were arbitrary and any effects could be treatment regimen-specific.

PROCEDURE: We present a pre-B-ALL patient in whom disease recurred 2 years after completion of treatment. Differences in cytomorphology and immunophenotyping raised a suspicion of secondary ALL. We performed detailed molecular studies of immunoglobulin and T-cell receptor genes for discrimination between relapsed and secondary ALL. RESULTS: Southern blot analysis showed an oligoclonal immunoglobulin heavy chain (IGH) gene configuration at diagnosis and a monoclonal configuration at relapse. The size of one of the rearranged bands at relapse was identical to one of the faint rearranged bands at diagnosis. However, heteroduplex PCR analysis demonstrated that none of the clonal IGH gene rearrangements at diagnosis and at relapse was fully identical. Sequencing of several clonal PCR products revealed an identical DH6-13<-->JH6b junction shared by two different rearrangements at diagnosis and one rearrangement at relapse, thereby proving the clonal relationship between diagnosis and late relapse in this patient. CONCLUSIONS: We propose a stepwise molecular approach for discrimination between relapsed and secondary ALL based on the rapid and cheap heteroduplex PCR technique, including mixing of clonal (homoduplex) PCR products identified at diagnosis and at relapse. Direct sequencing and comparative sequence analysis of IGH gene rearrangements at diagnosis and at relapse should be regarded as an ultimate standard, but can be limited to the rare cases, in which no identical clonal PCR products at diagnosis and at relapse were detected with the mixed heteroduplex PCR analyses.","['Szczepanski, T', 'Willemse, M J', 'Kamps, W A', 'van Wering, E R', 'Langerak, A W', 'van Dongen, J J']","['Szczepanski T', 'Willemse MJ', 'Kamps WA', 'van Wering ER', 'Langerak AW', 'van Dongen JJ']","['Department of Immunology, University Hospital Rotterdam/Erasmus University Rotterdam, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Med Pediatr Oncol,Medical and pediatric oncology,7506654,,IM,"['Blotting, Southern', 'Bone Marrow Cells/pathology', 'Child', 'Diagnosis, Differential', '*Gene Rearrangement', 'Genes, Immunoglobulin/*genetics', 'Genes, T-Cell Receptor/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/*diagnosis/pathology', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*diagnosis/pathology', 'Prognosis', 'Recurrence']",,2001/03/10 10:00,2001/04/21 10:01,['2001/03/10 10:00'],"['2001/03/10 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/04/21 10:01 [medline]', '2001/03/10 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Med Pediatr Oncol. 2001 Mar;36(3):352-8. doi: 10.1002/mpo.1085.,,"['Copyright 2001 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",['10.1002/mpo.1085 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PROCEDURE: Thirty-two children with ALL were studied at the end of treatment by means of motor evoked potentials (MEPs) elicited by magnetic stimulation (MS) transcranially and peripherally and underwent a detailed neurological examination. Thirty-two healthy children matched with them for age, sex, and height served as a control group. RESULTS: The latencies of the MEPs were significantly prolonged along the entire motor nervous pathway in the patients with ALL compared with the healthy controls, indicating demyelination in the thick motor fibres. The MEP amplitudes of the distal extremities elicited by stimulation at the brachial plexus and LV spinal level were significantly lowered in the patients treated for ALL, also indicating anatomical or functional loss of descending motor fibres and/or muscle fibres. The MEP amplitudes elicited by cortical MS showed wider variation and no clear abnormalities were found. Neurological signs and symptoms were common after treatment: 41% of the patients had depressed deep tendon reflexes, 31% had fine motor difficulties and 63% gross motor difficulties, and 34% had dysdiadochokinesia. The conduction delay within the peripheral nerve was related to the post-therapeutic interval after administration of vincristine and the lesions within the CNS to the number of injections of intrathecal methotrexate. CONCLUSIONS: The present results show adverse effects of the ALL treatment on the entire motor nervous pathways. In our experience, the measurement of MEPs by MS provides an objective, painless, and practical tool for assessing the treatment-related neurotoxicity in both the CNS and the peripheral nerves. These disturbances in the motor nervous pathways at the end of treatment raise the question of the long-term effects of ALL treatment on the motor nerve tracts, and have led us to employ MEPs to study these effects in long-term survivors of ALL.","['Harila-Saari, A H', 'Huuskonen, U E', 'Tolonen, U', 'Vainionpaa, L K', 'Lanning, B M']","['Harila-Saari AH', 'Huuskonen UE', 'Tolonen U', 'Vainionpaa LK', 'Lanning BM']","['Department of Pediatrics, Oulu University Central Hospital, Oulu, Finland.

Iron deprivation induced by desferrioxamine (DF) blocked PMA-induced differentiation and induced S-phase arrest and apoptosis in up to 60% of cells. Apoptosis was not related to a decrease of bcl-2 or to c-myc overexpression. In the presence of DF, PMA-induced upregulation of the cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor (CDKI), p21(WAF1/CIP1), was blocked and its expression could be restored in the presence of DF by supplementation with ferric citrate. Furthermore, ferrioxamine (iron saturated DF) did not block induction of p21(WAF1/CIP1) indicating that the changes were not due to a nonspecific toxic effect of DF. Similarly, hydroxyurea, an inhibitor of ribonucleotide reductase, did not block p21 expression. p21(WAF1/CIP1) antisense oligonucleotides caused cell cycle alterations similar to DF and p21 overexpression overcame effects of iron deprivation on both cell cycling and differentiation. Therefore, p21 is a key target for the effects of iron deprivation on HL-60 cell cycling and differentiation. Nuclear run-on transcription assays and p21 mRNA half-life studies indicated that iron was required to support transcriptional activation of p21(WAF1/CIP1) after a PMA stimulus. By contrast, iron deprivation did not inhibit expression of a second CDKI, p27(KIP1). These data demonstrate a new role for iron during monocyte/macrophage differentiation. A key role of iron is to allow induction of p21(WAF1/CIP1) in response to a differentiation stimulus subsequently blocking cells at the G(1)/S cell cycle interface and preventing premature apoptosis. This effect of iron is independent of its requirement in supporting the activity of the enzyme, ribonucleotide reductase. Because of the central role of p21(WAF1/CIP1) as regulator of the G(1)/S cell cycle checkpoint this requirement for iron to support p21 expression represents an important mechanism by which iron may modulate hematopoietic cell growth and differentiation.

In the current study, the authors report their experience with FNAB in patients with soft tissue ML and leukemia. METHODS: All cases of ML, leukemia, or atypical lymphoid cells from soft tissue aspirates were reviewed. Masses from lymph node-rich sites, those adjacent to enlarged lymph nodes, or those associated with cutaneous lesions were excluded. RESULTS: Twenty-one patients (male:female ratio of 1:1) who ranged in age from 10 months to 87 years (mean age, 51 years) were studied. Seven patients had superficial masses and 14 patients had deep soft tissue masses. Sites included the extremities (10 patients), trunk (8 patients), and head (3 patients). Cytologic diagnoses were ML (large cell [11 patients] and Hodgkin [1 patient]), acute leukemia (lymphoblastic [3 patients] and myelogenous [2 patients]), and atypical lymphoid cells (4 patients). Eight aspirates represented the initial diagnosis of ML, three were recurrent ML, four were recurrent leukemia, one was initial leukemia, and one ML aspirate was obtained concurrently with core needle biopsy. Four aspirates were diagnosed as atypical lymphoid cells. Three subsequently were diagnosed as ML and one aspirate was diagnosed as acute leukemia. All ML were of large B-cell type. One case of atypical lymphoid cells was found to be a mantle cell lymphoma. The leukemia cases were T-cell (two cases), pre-B-cell (two cases), and myelogenous (two cases). Immunophenotyping confirmed the cytology by flow cytometry (five cases), cytospin (three cases), and cell block (four cases). Immunophenotyping of eight cases was performed on tissue samples. In one case a cytopathologic diagnosis of ML reversed a prior tissue core biopsy diagnosis of liposarcoma. The specificity and sensitivity rates for a definitive diagnosis of ML or leukemia were 100% and 82%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: In the majority of cases, it is possible to determine a specific diagnosis and subtype of soft tissue ML or leukemia using FNAB.

Of the 31 patients, 16 (51.6%) had malignant teratomas, 8 (25.8%) had dysgerminomas, 6 (19%) endodermal sinus tumors and one (3.2%) mixed germ cell tumor. Twenty-four (77.4%) patients were at FIGO stage I (of which 18 were stage IA), 2 (6.5%) at stage II, 4 (12.9%) at stage III and 1 (3.2%) at stage IV. Twenty-five (80.6%) patients underwent conservative surgery, 1 (3.2%) underwent bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy and 4 (12.9%) had total hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy and omentectomy. One (3.2%) patient refused definitive treatment. Three patients with stage IA grade 1 immature teratomas were not treated with adjuvant chemotherapy and one patient with a stage IA dysgerminoma refused chemotherapy. Two patients with endodermal sinus tumor returned to their countries of origin after surgery. Twenty-five patients received bleomycin, etoposide, and cisplatin (BEP) regimen with etoposide dosage fixed at 120 mg/m2 on day 1 and day 2, bleomycin 15 mg intravenous bolus on days 1 and 2 and cisplatin 100 mg/m2 on day 1. Chemotherapy was administered at four weekly intervals for 4 cycles or until complete response was achieved. The median number of cycles of chemotherapy was four (range 3-6) for stage I, 6 (range 4-7) for stage II and 5 (range 5-6) for stage III tumors. Of the entire cohort of 29 patients analyzed, the median follow up period was 5 years. One patient died from stage IIIC endodermal sinus tumor and one patient had persistent teratoma in the lungs. The overall disease free survival control rate was 93.1%. There were three cases of the growing teratoma syndrome involving the liver, abdominal peritoneum, and the pelvis, respectively. No mortality resulted from the growing teratomas. No pulmonary complications, secondary primary tumor or leukemia was detected. Menstrual function returned in all patients with fertility-preserving surgery and one pregnancy occurred. This interesting data suggest that a medium dose 2-day BEP postsurgical adjuvant chemotherapy regimen is effective and superior to expectant treatment of malignant ovarian germ cell tumors.

Human T-cell lymphotrophic virus type 1 infection is the established cause of adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma, an aggressive malignancy of CD4+ T-cells, and two nonneoplastic conditions: human T-cell lymphotrophic virus type 1-associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis and human T-cell lymphotrophic virus type 1 uveitis. Other reported ophthalmic manifestations of human T-cell lymphotrophic virus type 1 infection include lymphomatous and leukemic infiltrates in the eye and ocular adnexa in patients with adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma, retinal pigmentary degeneration, and neuro-ophthalmic disorders in patients with human T-cell lymphotrophic virus type 1-associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis and keratoconjunctivitis sicca, episcleritis, and sclerouveitis in asymptomatic human T-cell lymphotrophic virus type 1 carriers. This report describes the ocular findings in three Jamaican patients with human T-cell lymphotrophic virus type 1 infection and adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma. METHODS: The clinical records of three patients with human T-cell lymphotrophic virus type 1 infection and adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma examined at the National Eye Institute were reviewed. Each patient had one or more complete ophthalmic evaluations. RESULTS: All three patients had corneal abnormalities, including corneal haze and central opacities with thinning; bilateral immunoprotein keratopathy; and peripheral corneal thinning, scarring, and neovascularization. All three patients had elevated serum immunoglobulin levels. CONCLUSIONS: We believe that the novel corneal findings in these patients are most likely a consequence of the hypergammaglobulinemia induced by the human T-cell lymphotrophic virus type 1 infection or the T-cell malignancy.","['Buggage, R R', 'Levy-Clarke, G A', 'Smith, J A']","['Buggage RR', 'Levy-Clarke GA', 'Smith JA']","['Laboratory of Immunology, National Eye Institute, National Institutes of Health, 10 Center Drive, Bldg. 10, Room 10 N112, Bethesda, MD 20892-1857, USA.

The K562 erythroleukemia cell line presented a strong GSTP1 promoter activity, as measured in transient transfection assays using a luciferase reporter plasmid, and correlated with a high mRNA whereas in Raji cells no mRNA was expressed. In order to establish a relationship between the expression and the methylation status, we used in vitro bisulfite sequencing which indicated that both methylated and unmethylated GSTP1 promoter alleles coexisted in K562 cells, whereas Raji lymphoma cells showed a nearly uniform hypermethylation of the promoter region. To determine the impact of methylation, we used in vitro SssI methylation of the minimal GSTP1 promoter, which led to the silencing of the promoter activity in transient transfection assays in expressing K562 as well as in non-expressing Raji cells. These data are in good agreement with previously obtained results and indicate that methylation of CpG sites of the basal promoter is an essential mechanism in the control of GSTP1 gene expression in human leukemia.","['Borde-Chiche, P', 'Diederich, M', 'Morceau, F', 'Puga, A', 'Wellman, M', 'Dicato, M']","['Borde-Chiche P', 'Diederich M', 'Morceau F', 'Puga A', 'Wellman M', 'Dicato M']","['Laboratoire de Recherche sur le Cancer et les Maladies du Sang (RCMS), Centre Universitaire de Luxembourg, 162A Avenue de la Faiencerie, L-1511, Luxembourg, Luxembourg.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Biochem Pharmacol,Biochemical pharmacology,0101032,"['0 (Isoenzymes)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 2.5.1.18 (GSTP1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.5.1.18 (Glutathione S-Transferase pi)', 'EC 2.5.1.18 (Glutathione Transferase)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'CpG Islands/physiology', 'DNA/analysis/metabolism', '*DNA Methylation', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic', 'Genome, Human', 'Glutathione S-Transferase pi', 'Glutathione Transferase/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Isoenzymes/*genetics', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/*physiology', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,2001/03/10 10:00,2001/04/06 10:01,['2001/03/10 10:00'],"['2001/03/10 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/04/06 10:01 [medline]', '2001/03/10 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Biochem Pharmacol. 2001 Mar 1;61(5):605-12. doi: 10.1016/s0006-2952(00)00581-5.,,,"['S0006295200005815 [pii]', '10.1016/s0006-2952(00)00581-5 [doi]']",,"['P30 ES06096/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 ES06273/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,

PBSCs are readily collected by continuous-flow apheresis from patients and healthy donors after the administration of s.c. recombinant colony-stimulating factors with only minimal morbidity and discomfort. Although the precise identification of PBSCs remains elusive, they can be phenotypically identified as a subset of all circulating CD34(+) cells. There are important phenotypic and biologic distinctions between PBSCs and bone marrow (BM)-derived progenitor cells. PBSCs express more lineage-specific antigens but are less metabolically active than their BM-derived counterparts. The use of PBSCs for allogeneic transplantation has been compared to BM in several randomized trials and cohort studies. The use of PBSCs in leukemia, myeloma, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, and myelodysplasia has resulted in shorter times to neutrophil and platelet engraftment at the expense of increased rates of chronic graft-versus-host disease. The increase in graft-versus-host disease is mainly due to a log-fold increase in donor T cells transferred with the graft. Relapse rates after transplantation may be lower after PBSC transplantation but a convincing survival advantage has not been demonstrated overall. It is possible that a stronger graft-versus-tumor effect may exist with PBSCs when compared with BM although the mechanisms leading to this effect are not clear.","['Cutler, C', 'Antin, J H']","['Cutler C', 'Antin JH']","[""Department of Adult Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts 02115, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Stem Cells,"Stem cells (Dayton, Ohio)",9304532,,IM,"['Animals', 'Graft vs Host Disease', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",84,2001/03/10 10:00,2001/06/29 10:01,['2001/03/10 10:00'],"['2001/03/10 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/06/29 10:01 [medline]', '2001/03/10 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Stem Cells. 2001;19(2):108-17. doi: 10.1634/stemcells.19-2-108.,,,['10.1634/stemcells.19-2-108 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we report that ELL can regulate cell proliferation and survival. In order to better understand the physiological role of the ELL protein, we have developed an ELL-inducible cell line. Cells expressing ELL were uniformly inhibited for growth by a loss of the G(1) population and an increase in the G(2)/M population. This decrease in cell growth is followed by the condensation of chromosomal DNA, activation of caspase 3, poly(ADP ribose) polymerase cleavage, and an increase in sub-G(1) population, which are all indicators of the process of programmed cell death. In support of the role of ELL in induction of cell death, expression of an ELL antisense RNA or addition of the caspase inhibitor ZVAD-fmk results in a reversal of ELL-mediated death. We have also demonstrated that the C-terminal domain of ELL, which is conserved among the ELL family of proteins that we have cloned (ELL, ELL2, and ELL3), is required for ELL's activity in the regulation of cell growth. These novel results indicate that ELL can regulate cell growth and survival and may explain how ELL translocations result in the development of human malignancies.","['Johnstone, R W', 'Gerber, M', 'Landewe, T', 'Tollefson, A', 'Wold, W S', 'Shilatifard, A']","['Johnstone RW', 'Gerber M', 'Landewe T', 'Tollefson A', 'Wold WS', 'Shilatifard A']","['The Peter MacCallum Cancer Institute, Gene Regulation Laboratory, Cancer Immunology Division, East Melbourne, 3002 Victoria, Australia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,"['0 (Amino Acid Chloromethyl Ketones)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation)', '0 (Caspase Inhibitors)', '0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (Cysteine Proteinase Inhibitors)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (ELL protein, human)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Oligonucleotides, Antisense)', '0 (Peptide Elongation Factors)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Transcriptional Elongation Factors)', '0 (benzyloxycarbonylvalyl-alanyl-aspartyl fluoromethyl ketone)', '36015-30-2 (Propidium)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 2.4.2.30 (Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases)', 'EC 3.1.3.16 (PPP1R15A protein, human)', 'EC 3.1.3.16 (Protein Phosphatase 1)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Chloromethyl Ketones/pharmacology', 'Antigens, Differentiation', 'Apoptosis', 'Blotting, Western', 'Caspase 3', 'Caspase Inhibitors', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Cell Cycle Proteins', 'Cell Death', 'Cell Division', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Survival', 'Cysteine Proteinase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'DNA/metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/*physiology', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Flow Cytometry', 'G1 Phase', 'G2 Phase', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/*metabolism', 'Microscopy, Fluorescence', 'Microscopy, Phase-Contrast', 'Mitosis', '*Neoplasm Proteins', 'Oligonucleotides, Antisense/metabolism', '*Peptide Elongation Factors', 'Plasmids/metabolism', 'Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases/metabolism', 'Propidium/pharmacology', 'Protein Phosphatase 1', 'Proteins/metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Time Factors', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/*physiology', 'Transcriptional Elongation Factors', 'Transfection', 'Translocation, Genetic', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,2001/03/10 10:00,2001/04/17 10:01,['2001/03/10 10:00'],"['2001/03/10 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/04/17 10:01 [medline]', '2001/03/10 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 2001 Mar;21(5):1672-81. doi: 10.1128/MCB.21.5.1672-1681.2001.,,,['10.1128/MCB.21.5.1672-1681.2001 [doi]'],PMC86713,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the expression of high levels of ICP0, as from ICP4(-) HSV type 1 (HSV-1) vectors, results in marked toxicity. We have analyzed the results of ICP0 expressed from an E1(-) E4(-) adenovirus vector (AdS.11E4ICP0) in which ICP0 expression is controlled from the endogenous adenoviral E4 promoter. In this system, the expression level of ICP0 was reduced more than 1,000-fold relative to the level of expression from HSV-1 vectors. This low level of ICP0 did not affect cellular division or greatly perturb cellular metabolism as assessed by gene expression array analysis comparing the effects of HSV and adenovirus vector strains. However, this amount of ICP0 was sufficient to quantitatively destroy ND10 structures as measured by promyelocytic leukemia immunofluorescence. The levels of adenovirus-expressed ICP0 were sufficient to activate quiescent viral genomes in trans and promote persistent transgene expression in cis. Moreover, infection of complementing cells with AdS.11E4ICP0 promoted viral growth and resulted in a 20-fold increase in the plaquing efficiency of d109, a virus defective for all five immediate-early genes. Thus, the low level expression of ICP0 from the E1(-) E4(-) adenovirus vector may increase the utility of adenovirus vectors and also provides a means to efficiently quantify and possibly propagate HSV vectors defective in ICP0. Importantly, the results demonstrate that the activation function of ICP0 may not result from changes in cellular gene expression, but possibly as a direct consequence of an enzymatic function inherent to the protein that may involve its action at ND10 resulting in the preferential activation of viral genomes.","['Hobbs, W E', 'Brough, D E', 'Kovesdi, I', 'DeLuca, N A']","['Hobbs WE', 'Brough DE', 'Kovesdi I', 'DeLuca NA']","['Department of Molecular Genetics and Biochemistry, University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania 15261, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Immediate-Early Proteins)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Vmw110 protein, Human herpesvirus 1)']",IM,"['Adenoviridae/genetics', 'Animals', 'Cell Division', 'Cell Survival', 'Cells, Cultured', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Viral', '*Genome, Viral', 'Herpesvirus 1, Human/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Immediate-Early Proteins/chemistry/*physiology', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Transgenes', 'Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases']",,2001/03/10 10:00,2001/04/06 10:01,['2001/03/10 10:00'],"['2001/03/10 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/04/06 10:01 [medline]', '2001/03/10 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Virol. 2001 Apr;75(7):3391-403. doi: 10.1128/JVI.75.7.3391-3403.2001.,,,['10.1128/JVI.75.7.3391-3403.2001 [doi]'],PMC114132,"['P01 DK044935/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AI044821/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'AI44812/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'DK44935/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Cells producing infectious Friend virus were rapidly eliminated from the spleens of mice that had been immunized with the single-epitope peptide. However, actual effector mechanisms induced through T-helper-cell responses after Friend virus inoculation were unknown. When cytotoxic effector cells detected in the early phase of Friend retrovirus infection were separated based on their expression of cell surface markers, those lacking CD4 and CD8 but expressing natural killer cell markers were found to constitute the majority of effector cells that lysed Friend virus-induced leukemia cells. Depletion of natural killer cells by injecting anti-asialo-ganglio-N-tetraosylceramide antibody did not affect the number of CD4(+) or CD8(+) T cells in the spleen, virus antigen-specific proliferative responses of CD4(+) T cells, or cytotoxic activity against Friend virus-induced leukemia cells exerted by CD8(+) effector cells. However, the same treatment markedly reduced the killing activity of CD4(-) CD8(-) effector cells and completely abolished the effect of peptide immunization. Although the above enhancement of natural killer cell activity in the early stage of Friend virus infection was also observed in mice given no peptide, these results have demonstrated the importance and requirement of natural killer cells in vaccine-induced resistance against the retroviral infection.","['Iwanami, N', 'Niwa, A', 'Yasutomi, Y', 'Tabata, N', 'Miyazawa, M']","['Iwanami N', 'Niwa A', 'Yasutomi Y', 'Tabata N', 'Miyazawa M']","['Department of Immunology, Kinki University School of Medicine, Osaka-Sayama, Osaka 589-8511, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Epitopes, T-Lymphocyte)', '0 (Viral Vaccines)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Epitopes, T-Lymphocyte', '*Friend murine leukemia virus', 'Immunization', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*immunology', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*immunology/prevention & control', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Retroviridae Infections/*immunology', 'Tumor Virus Infections/*immunology', 'Viral Vaccines/immunology']",,2001/03/10 10:00,2001/04/06 10:01,['2001/03/10 10:00'],"['2001/03/10 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/04/06 10:01 [medline]', '2001/03/10 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Virol. 2001 Apr;75(7):3152-63. doi: 10.1128/JVI.75.7.3152-3163.2001.,,,['10.1128/JVI.75.7.3152-3163.2001 [doi]'],PMC114109,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although HTLV-1 can replicate via the reverse transcription of virion RNA to a double-stranded DNA provirus (the conventional manner for retroviruses), its predominant mode of replication is via the clonal expansion (mitosis) of the infected cell. This expansion is achieved by the viral oncoprotein Tax, which keeps the infected CD4 T lymphocyte cycling. Because Tax also interferes with cellular DNA repair pathways, we investigated whether somatic mutations of the provirus that occur during the division of infected cells could account for HTLV-1 genetic variability. METHODS: An inverse polymerase chain reaction strategy was designed to distinguish somatic mutations from reverse transcription-associated substitutions. This strategy allows the proviral sequences to be isolated together with flanking cellular sequences. Using this method, we sequenced 208 HTLV-1 provirus 3' segments, together with their integration sites, belonging to 29 distinct circulating cellular clones from infected individuals. RESULTS: For 60% of the clones, 8%-80% of infected cells harbored a mutated HTLV-1 provirus, without evidence of reverse transcription-associated mutations. Mutations within flanking cellular sequences were also identified at a frequency of 2.8 x 10(-4) substitution per base pair. Some of these clones carried multiple discrete substitutions or deletions, indicating progressive accumulation of mutations during clonal expansion. The overall frequency of somatic mutations increased with the degree of proliferation of infected T cells. CONCLUSIONS: These data indicate that, in vivo, HTLV-1 variation results mainly from postintegration events that consist of somatic mutations of the proviral sequence occurring during clonal expansion. The finding of substitutions in flanking sequences suggests that somatic mutations occurring after integration, presumably coupled with selection, help move the cellular clones toward a transformed phenotype, of which adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma is the end point.","['Mortreux, F', 'Leclercq, I', 'Gabet, A S', 'Leroy, A', 'Westhof, E', 'Gessain, A', 'Wain-Hobson, S', 'Wattel, E']","['Mortreux F', 'Leclercq I', 'Gabet AS', 'Leroy A', 'Westhof E', 'Gessain A', 'Wain-Hobson S', 'Wattel E']","['Unite 524 Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale (INSERM), Lille, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Natl Cancer Inst,Journal of the National Cancer Institute,7503089,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (RNA, Viral)', 'EC 4.2.1.11 (Phosphopyruvate Hydratase)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Base Sequence', 'Blotting, Southern', '*Cloning, Molecular', 'DNA Primers', 'DNA, Viral/*genetics', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Molecular Sequence Data', '*Mutation', 'Phosphopyruvate Hydratase/genetics', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction/methods', 'Proviruses/*genetics', 'RNA, Viral/genetics', 'Terminal Repeat Sequences/*genetics', 'Transcription, Genetic/*genetics']",,2001/03/10 10:00,2001/04/06 10:01,['2001/03/10 10:00'],"['2001/03/10 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/04/06 10:01 [medline]', '2001/03/10 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Natl Cancer Inst. 2001 Mar 7;93(5):367-77. doi: 10.1093/jnci/93.5.367.,,,['10.1093/jnci/93.5.367 [doi]'],,,,['J Natl Cancer Inst. 2001 Mar 7;93(5):336-7.

Transient expression assays revealed that lactoferrin can transactivate HTLV-I long terminal repeat promoter.

Recent work suggested that this motif contributes to G protein-coupled receptor internalization and signal transduction; however, its role in FPR signaling remains unclear. In this study we replaced Asn(297) and Tyr(301) in the NPXXY motif of the human FPR with Ala (N297A) and Ala/Phe (Y301A/Y301F), respectively, and determined the effects of the substitutions on FPR functions in transfected rat basophilic leukemia cells. Whereas all the mutant receptors were expressed on the cell surface, the N297A receptor exhibited reduced binding affinity and was unable to mediate activation of phospholipase C-beta and the p42/44 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAP kinase). The Y301F receptor displayed significantly decreased ligand-stimulated internalization and MAP kinase activation, suggesting that the hydrogen bonding at Tyr(301) is critical for these functions. The Y301F receptor showed a chemotactic response similar to that of wild-type FPR, indicating that cell chemotaxis does not require receptor internalization and hydrogen bonding at the Tyr(301) position. In contrast, the Y301A receptor displayed a left-shifted, but overall reduced, chemotaxis response that peaked at 0.1-1 nM. Finally, using a specific MAP kinase kinase inhibitor, we found that activation of MAP kinase is required for efficient FPR internalization, but is not essential for chemotaxis. These findings demonstrate that residues within the NPXXY motif differentially regulate the functions of FPR.","['He, R', 'Browning, D D', 'Ye, R D']","['He R', 'Browning DD', 'Ye RD']","['Department of Pharmacology, University of Illinois College of Medicine, Chicago, IL 60612, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Butadienes)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Nitriles)', '0 (Peptide Fragments)', '0 (Receptors, Formyl Peptide)', '0 (Receptors, Immunologic)', '0 (Receptors, Peptide)', '0 (U 0126)', '59880-97-6 (N-Formylmethionine Leucyl-Phenylalanine)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Motifs/genetics/immunology', 'Animals', 'Butadienes/pharmacology', 'Calcium/metabolism', 'Chemotaxis, Leukocyte/drug effects/immunology', 'Conserved Sequence/genetics/immunology', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Mutagenesis, Site-Directed', 'N-Formylmethionine Leucyl-Phenylalanine/*metabolism', 'Nitriles/pharmacology', 'Peptide Fragments/biosynthesis/genetics/*immunology/metabolism', 'Protein Binding/genetics/immunology', 'Rats', 'Receptors, Formyl Peptide', 'Receptors, Immunologic/biosynthesis/genetics/metabolism/*physiology', 'Receptors, Peptide/biosynthesis/genetics/metabolism/*physiology', 'Signal Transduction/genetics/*immunology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,2001/03/10 10:00,2001/05/18 10:01,['2001/03/10 10:00'],"['2001/03/10 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/05/18 10:01 [medline]', '2001/03/10 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 2001 Mar 15;166(6):4099-105. doi: 10.4049/jimmunol.166.6.4099.,,,['10.4049/jimmunol.166.6.4099 [doi]'],,['AI33503/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,

To date, 10 mutant alleles are known that are associated with intermediate or low TPMT activity. To facilitate rapid screening of clinically relevant TPMT mutations, we developed a strategy of high-throughput genotyping by applying denaturing HPLC (DHPLC). METHODS: To test the specificity and efficiency of the DHPLC method, 98 DNA samples from a selected population of patients receiving thiopurine therapy or with previous thiopurine withdrawal were analyzed for the most frequent mutant TPMT alleles, *2 and *3A, which contain key mutations in exons 5, 7, and 10 to identify clearly different elution profiles. All fragments were examined by direct sequencing. Additionally, to test the sensitivity of DHPLC analysis, genotyping for the *2 and *3A alleles of all 98 DNA samples was performed by PCR-based methods (PCR-restriction fragment polymorphism analysis and allele-specific PCR). RESULTS: The presence of mutations discriminating for alleles *2, *3A, *3C, and *3D, as well as various silent and intron mutations, were correctly predicted by DHPLC in 100% of the samples as confirmed by direct sequencing. Comparison with PCR-based methods for alleles *2 and *3 produced an agreement of 100% with no false-negative signals. CONCLUSIONS: DHPLC offers a highly sensitive, rapid, and efficient method for genotyping of the relevant TPMT mutations, discriminating at least for alleles *2 and *3, in clinical and laboratory practice. Additionally, DHPLC allows a simultaneous screening for novel genetic variability in the TPMT gene.","['Schaeffeler, E', 'Lang, T', 'Zanger, U M', 'Eichelbaum, M', 'Schwab, M']","['Schaeffeler E', 'Lang T', 'Zanger UM', 'Eichelbaum M', 'Schwab M']","['Dr. Margarete Fischer-Bosch Institute of Clinical Pharmacology, Auerbachstrasse 112, D-70376 Stuttgart, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Clin Chem,Clinical chemistry,9421549,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', 'E7WED276I5 (Mercaptopurine)', 'EC 2.1.1.- (Methyltransferases)', 'EC 2.1.1.67 (thiopurine methyltransferase)']",IM,"['Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/adverse effects', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Genotype', 'Humans', 'Mercaptopurine/adverse effects', 'Methyltransferases/*genetics', 'Mutation', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Polymorphism, Restriction Fragment Length', 'Reproducibility of Results']",,2001/03/10 10:00,2001/03/27 10:01,['2001/03/10 10:00'],"['2001/03/10 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/27 10:01 [medline]', '2001/03/10 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Clin Chem. 2001 Mar;47(3):548-55.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We developed such an assay with an internal reference template. METHODS: For quantification of target and reference sequences, we used two fluorescent probes in one reaction vessel on an ABI PRISM 7700 SDS instrument. Fluorescent probes were labeled with either 6-carboxy-fluorescein or hexachloro-6-carboxy-fluorescein as reporter dye and 4-(4'-dimethylaminophenylazo)benzoic acid (DABCYL) as a dark quencher fluorophore. To test the sensitivity and specificity of this assay, serial dilutions of reference and target templates were analyzed in one PCR reaction. In the presence of 10 beta-actin molecules as control templates, 10(5) bcr/abl molecules were amplified, and 10(5) beta-actin molecules were amplified in the presence of 10 bcr/abl copies. We also performed single and duplex measurements on samples from five patients with documented Philadelphia chromosome-positive chronic myelogenous leukemia disease courses (72 samples) and three with minor bcr/abl+ acute myelogenous leukemias (26 samples). RESULTS: For M-bcr/abl duplex RT-PCR, the correlation coefficient (r) for starting template amounts and threshold cycle values was 0.99; for m-bcr/abl, r = 0.96, indicating a precise log-linear relation for 10-10(5) copies/100 ng of cDNA. In the same PCR reactions, r = 0.99 for beta-actin (coamplified with M-bcr/abl or m-bcr/abl) for 10(3)-10(7) copies/100 ng cDNA.

In the present study, we examined the mechanisms that govern LIF expression and functional effects in the adult heart. METHODS AND RESULTS: LIF mRNA and protein biosynthesis were examined in the adult feline heart after hemodynamic overloading ex vivo. Both LIF mRNA and protein expression were detected within 60 to 90 minutes after hemodynamic overloading. Studies in isolated adult cardiac myocytes showed that these cells synthesized both LIF mRNA and protein. The functional effects of LIF in the heart were demonstrated by studies that showed that LIF stimulation led to a significant increase in general protein synthesis and an increase in sarcomeric protein synthesis. Pretreatment with LIF also protected the cells against hypoxia/reoxygenation-induced cardiac myocyte apoptosis and cellular injury. Finally, LIF had no effect on isolated cardiac myocyte cell motion. CONCLUSIONS: Hemodynamic overload is a sufficient stimulus for LIF expression in the adult mammalian heart. Given that LIF confers both hypertrophic and cytoprotective responses in adult cardiac myocytes, this study suggests that the expression of LIF within the heart may play an important role in mediating homeostatic responses within the myocardium.","['Wang, F', 'Seta, Y', 'Baumgarten, G', 'Engel, D J', 'Sivasubramanian, N', 'Mann, D L']","['Wang F', 'Seta Y', 'Baumgarten G', 'Engel DJ', 'Sivasubramanian N', 'Mann DL']","['Winters Center for Heart Failure Research, Department of Medicine, Houston VA Medical Center,Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX 77030, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Circulation,Circulation,0147763,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Flavonoids)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', 'EC 1.1.1.27 (L-Lactate Dehydrogenase)', 'EC 2.7.12.2 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinases)', 'SJE1IO5E3I (2-(2-amino-3-methoxyphenyl)-4H-1-benzopyran-4-one)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Blotting, Northern', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cats', 'Cell Hypoxia', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/metabolism', 'Flavonoids/pharmacology', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Growth Inhibitors/*genetics/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Hemodynamics/physiology', 'In Vitro Techniques', '*Interleukin-6', 'L-Lactate Dehydrogenase/drug effects/metabolism', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Lymphokines/*genetics/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinases/metabolism', 'Myocardium/cytology/*metabolism', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Pressure', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor', 'Time Factors', 'Trans-Activators/metabolism']",,2001/03/10 10:00,2001/05/25 10:01,['2001/03/10 10:00'],"['2001/03/10 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/05/25 10:01 [medline]', '2001/03/10 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Circulation. 2001 Mar 6;103(9):1296-302. doi: 10.1161/01.cir.103.9.1296.,,,['10.1161/01.cir.103.9.1296 [doi]'],,"['HL-42250-10/10/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'P50-HL-O6H/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01-HL-58081-01/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01-HL-61543-01/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Signaling through Fas requires the formation of a death-inducing signaling complex (DISC) that involves the cytoplasmic domain of Fas, the adaptor molecule FADD/MORT-1, and procaspase-8. The present study investigated whether another caspase, known as procaspase-2L, played a role in Fas-mediated cell death. A series of human leukemic variant cells was derived by stable transfection with a CASP2L antisense construct (CASP2L/AS). Specific down-regulation of procaspase-2L decreased the sensitivity of these cells to apoptosis induced by an agonistic anti-Fas antibody (Ab, clone CH11), as determined by studying DNA fragmentation, chromatin condensation, and externalization of phosphatidylserine on the plasma membrane. In leukemic cells transfected with an empty vector, anti-Fas Ab treatment activated caspase-8, decreased the expression of the BH3 domain-only protein Bid, triggered the release of cytochrome c from the mitochondria to the cytosol, and activated caspase-3. All these events could not be observed when CASP2L/AS cells were similarly treated with anti-Fas Abs. CASP2L/AS transfection did not inhibit the formation of the DISC and no direct interaction between procaspase-2L and either Fas or FADD or procaspase-8 was identified. Down-regulation of procaspase-2L inhibited anti-Fas Ab-mediated cleavage of c-FLIP (FLICE-inhibitory protein), a protein that interferes with the formation of a functional DISC. These results suggest that the long isoform of caspase-2 plays a role in the Fas-mediated pathway to cell death by contributing to caspase-8 activation at the DISC level.","['Droin, N', 'Bichat, F', 'Rebe, C', 'Wotawa, A', 'Sordet, O', 'Hammann, A', 'Bertrand, R', 'Solary, E']","['Droin N', 'Bichat F', 'Rebe C', 'Wotawa A', 'Sordet O', 'Hammann A', 'Bertrand R', 'Solary E']","['INSERM U517, Faculties of Medicine and Pharmacy, Dijon, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (BH3 Interacting Domain Death Agonist Protein)', '0 (BID protein, human)', '0 (CASP8 and FADD-Like Apoptosis Regulating Protein)', '0 (CFLAR protein, human)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Cytochrome c Group)', '0 (DNA, Antisense)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Protein Isoforms)', '0 (fas Receptor)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP8 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP9 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 2)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 8)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 9)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'BH3 Interacting Domain Death Agonist Protein', 'CASP8 and FADD-Like Apoptosis Regulating Protein', 'Carrier Proteins/drug effects/metabolism', 'Caspase 2', 'Caspase 3', 'Caspase 8', 'Caspase 9', 'Caspases/drug effects/genetics/metabolism/pharmacology/*physiology', 'Cytochrome c Group/drug effects/metabolism', 'DNA, Antisense/pharmacology', 'Humans', '*Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Protein Isoforms/genetics/pharmacology/physiology', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'fas Receptor/*pharmacology']",,2001/03/10 10:00,2001/05/01 10:01,['2001/03/10 10:00'],"['2001/03/10 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/05/01 10:01 [medline]', '2001/03/10 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 2001 Mar 15;97(6):1835-44. doi: 10.1182/blood.v97.6.1835.,,,"['10.1182/blood.v97.6.1835 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)56204-6 [pii]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Constitutive activation of ERK-1/2 and MEK-1/2, which elicit oncogenic transformation in fibroblasts, has recently been observed in acute myeloid leukemias (AML). In this study, the activation of the RAS-to-MAPK cascade in 14 AML and 5 chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) cell lines is examined and correlated with the effects of a panel of 9 RAS signaling inhibitors on cell viability, colony formation, cell-cycle progression, and induction of apoptosis. Activation of MEK, ERK, and the transcription factors CREB-1, ATF-1, and c-Myc is demonstrated in the majority of the cell lines (9 of 14 AML and 2 of 5 CML cell lines). Although activation of the ERK cascade did not always correlate with the presence of activating RAS mutations or BCR-Abl, it is linked to the G0/G1 and the G2/M phase of the cell cycle. In contrast to most inhibitors (eg, B581, Cys-4-Abs-Met, FPT-2, FTI-276, and FTS), a significant growth inhibition was only observed for FTI-277 (19 of 19), FPT-3 (10 of 19), and the MEK inhibitors U0126 (19 of 19) and PD098059 (8 of 19). Treatment of NB-4 cells with FTI-277 primarily resulted in a G2/M block, whereas treatment with FPT-3 and U0126 led to induction of apoptosis. FTI-277 revealed strong toxicity toward normal purified CD34+ cells. The results suggest differences in the mechanisms of action and support a potential therapeutic usefulness of these inhibitors in the treatment of myeloid leukemias.","['Morgan, M A', 'Dolp, O', 'Reuter, C W']","['Morgan MA', 'Dolp O', 'Reuter CW']","['Department of Hematology and Oncology, Section Molecular Biology, University of Ulm, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (MAP2K2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1)', 'EC 2.7.12.2 (MAP Kinase Kinase 1)', 'EC 2.7.12.2 (MAP Kinase Kinase 2)', 'EC 2.7.12.2 (MAP2K1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.12.2 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinases)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (ras Proteins)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cell Cycle/*drug effects/physiology', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*drug therapy/enzymology/pathology', 'MAP Kinase Kinase 1', 'MAP Kinase Kinase 2', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1/metabolism', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism/physiology', 'Mutation', 'Neoplasm Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism/physiology', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism/physiology', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Stem Cells/drug effects', 'Transcription Factors/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'ras Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism']",,2001/03/10 10:00,2001/05/01 10:01,['2001/03/10 10:00'],"['2001/03/10 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/05/01 10:01 [medline]', '2001/03/10 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 2001 Mar 15;97(6):1823-34. doi: 10.1182/blood.v97.6.1823.,,,"['10.1182/blood.v97.6.1823 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)56203-4 [pii]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Two forms, alpha-1 and alpha-2, have intracytoplasmic sequences that are identical within a membrane-proximal domain but differ completely distally. Variant and mutated GM-CSF receptor alpha subunits, along with the beta subunit (beta(c) protein) were expressed in M1 murine leukemia cells. and the ability of the receptors to signal for differentiation events and to activate Jak/Stat signaling pathways was examined. All cell lines expressing both alpha and beta(c) proteins exhibited high-affinity binding of radiolabeled human GM-CSF. Receptor alpha subunits with intact membrane-proximal intracellular domains could induce expression of the macrophage antigen F4/80 and down-regulate the expression of CD11b. Addition of recombinant human GM-CSF to cells expressing alpha-1 subunits induced the expression of CD86 and tyrosine phosphorylation of Jak-2 and its putative substrates SHPTP-2, Stat-5, and the GM-CSF receptor beta(c) subunit. Cells containing alpha subunits that lacked a distal domain (term-3) or had the alternatively spliced alpha-2 distal domain showed markedly decreased ability to support tyrosine phosphorylation of Jak-2 and its substrates or to up-regulate CD86. Ligand binding induced stable association of the alpha-1 subunit and beta(c) protein. In contrast, the alpha-2 subunit did not stably associate with the beta(c) subunit. These data identify potential molecular mechanisms for differential signaling of the alpha-1 and alpha-2 proteins. The association of unique signaling events with the 2 active GM-CSF alpha subunit isoforms offers a model for variable response phenotypes to the same ligand.","['Lilly, M B', 'Zemskova, M', 'Frankel, A E', 'Salo, J', 'Kraft, A S']","['Lilly MB', 'Zemskova M', 'Frankel AE', 'Salo J', 'Kraft AS']","['Department of Medicine and the Center for Molecular Biology and Gene Therapy, Loma Linda University, Loma Linda, CA 92354, USA. mlilly@som.llu.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation)', '0 (B7-2 Antigen)', '0 (CD86 protein, human)', '0 (Cd86 protein, mouse)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Macrophage-1 Antigen)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Milk Proteins)', '0 (Protein Subunits)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '0 (STAT5 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (monocyte-macrophage differentiation antigen)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (JAK2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Jak2 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 2)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, CD/drug effects/metabolism', 'Antigens, Differentiation/*drug effects/metabolism', 'B7-2 Antigen', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*metabolism/physiology', 'Humans', 'Janus Kinase 2', 'Macrophage-1 Antigen/drug effects/metabolism', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/drug effects/metabolism', 'Mice', '*Milk Proteins', 'Mutation', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Protein Subunits', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*metabolism/physiology', '*Proto-Oncogene Proteins', 'Receptors, Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/*chemistry/genetics/*physiology', 'STAT5 Transcription Factor', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Trans-Activators/*metabolism/physiology', 'Transduction, Genetic', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,2001/03/10 10:00,2001/05/01 10:01,['2001/03/10 10:00'],"['2001/03/10 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/05/01 10:01 [medline]', '2001/03/10 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 2001 Mar 15;97(6):1662-70. doi: 10.1182/blood.v97.6.1662.,,,"['10.1182/blood.v97.6.1662 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)56182-X [pii]']",,"['CA45672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'DK44741/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Poor risk was defined by the presence of the translocations t(9;22) (n = 97), or t(4;11) (n = 25), or t(1;19) (n = 5). Sixty-four patients underwent transplantation in first remission (CR1), 16 in CR2 or CR3, and 47 patients had relapsed ALL or primary induction failure (PIF). Overall survival at 2 years from transplant was 40% for patients in CR1, 17% in CR2/3, and 5% in PIF or relapse. Treatment-related mortality (TRM) and relapse mortality, estimated as competing risk factors, were 54% and 6%, respectively, in CR1, 75% and 8% in CR2/3, and 64% and 31% in PIF or relapse. Currently 23 CR1 patients are alive and free of disease with a median follow-up of 24 months (range, 3-97). Multivariable analysis showed that CR1, shorter interval from diagnosis to transplantation, DRB1 match, negative cytomegalovirus (CMV) serology (patient and donor), and presence of the Philadelphia chromosome, t(9;22), were independently associated with better disease-free survival (DFS). Transplantation in CR and presence of t(9;22) were associated with lower risk of relapse. Shorter interval from diagnosis to transplantation, DRB1-match, negative CMV, higher marrow cell dose, and Karnofsky score of 90 or higher were associated with less TRM. These results indicate that, despite a relatively high TRM, the low relapse rate resulted in a 37% +/- 13% DFS for CR1 patients, comparing favorably to results obtained with chemotherapy alone and matching results following HLA-identical sibling transplantation.","['Cornelissen, J J', 'Carston, M', 'Kollman, C', 'King, R', 'Dekker, A W', 'Lowenberg, B', 'Anasetti, C']","['Cornelissen JJ', 'Carston M', 'Kollman C', 'King R', 'Dekker AW', 'Lowenberg B', 'Anasetti C']","['University Hospital Rotterdam/Daniel den Hoed Cancer Center, Rotterdam, The Netherlands. cornelissen@hemh.azr.nl']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,,IM,"['Actuarial Analysis', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/*standards', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease/mortality', 'Graft vs Leukemia Effect/immunology', '*Histocompatibility/immunology', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/complications/*therapy', 'Remission Induction', 'Risk Factors', 'Survival Rate', 'Treatment Outcome']",,2001/03/10 10:00,2001/05/01 10:01,['2001/03/10 10:00'],"['2001/03/10 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/05/01 10:01 [medline]', '2001/03/10 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 2001 Mar 15;97(6):1572-7. doi: 10.1182/blood.v97.6.1572.,,,"['10.1182/blood.v97.6.1572 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)56170-3 [pii]']",,['P01 CA1802/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,['Blood. 2002 Mar 15;99(6):2270-1.

However, most of these studies were performed using qualitative RT-PCR, and the interpretation of the results obtained has been conflicting. The correlation of a quantitative RT-PCR test performed early after SCT (at 3 to 5 months) and long-term outcome of CML patients surviving for more than 6 months was studied. Between January 1991 and June 1999, data from 138 CML patients who received allografts were evaluated. Early RT-PCR results were classified as (1) negative if there were no BCR-ABL transcripts detected (n = 61), (2) positive at low level if the total number of BCR-ABL transcripts was less than 100 per microg RNA and/or the BCR-ABL/ABL ratio was less than 0.02% (n = 14), or (3) positive at high level if transcript levels exceeded the thresholds defined above (n = 63). Three years after SCT the cumulative incidence of relapse was 16.7%, 42.9%, and 86.4%, respectively (P =.0001). The relationship between BCR-ABL transcript level and probability of relapse was apparent whether patients had received sibling or unrelated donor SCT and also whether or not the transplantation was T cell depleted. The results suggest that quantitative RT-PCR performed early after SCT is useful for predicting outcome and may help to define the need for further treatment.","['Olavarria, E', 'Kanfer, E', 'Szydlo, R', 'Kaeda, J', 'Rezvani, K', 'Cwynarski, K', 'Pocock, C', 'Dazzi, F', 'Craddock, C', 'Apperley, J F', 'Cross, N C', 'Goldman, J M']","['Olavarria E', 'Kanfer E', 'Szydlo R', 'Kaeda J', 'Rezvani K', 'Cwynarski K', 'Pocock C', 'Dazzi F', 'Craddock C', 'Apperley JF', 'Cross NC', 'Goldman JM']","['Department of Haematology, Hammersmith Hospital, Imperial College School of Medicine, London, England. e.olavarria@ic.ac.uk']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (RNA, Messenger)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Actuarial Analysis', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Child', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*genetics', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*methods/standards', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*diagnosis/genetics/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', 'RNA, Messenger/*blood', 'Recurrence', '*Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Survival Rate', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Treatment Outcome']",,2001/03/10 10:00,2001/05/01 10:01,['2001/03/10 10:00'],"['2001/03/10 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/05/01 10:01 [medline]', '2001/03/10 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 2001 Mar 15;97(6):1560-5. doi: 10.1182/blood.v97.6.1560.,,,"['10.1182/blood.v97.6.1560 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)56167-3 [pii]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we have cloned FRAT2 cDNAs, spanning the complete coding sequence, from a human fetal lung cDNA library. FRAT2 encoded 233 amino-acid protein, which showed 77.3% total amino-acid identity with FRAT1. FRAT2 and FRAT1 were more homologous in the acidic domain (96% identity), the proline-rich domain (92% identity), and the GSK-3beta binding domain (100% identity). The FRAT2 gene was mapped to human chromosome 10q24.1. The FRAT2 mRNA of 2.4-kb in size was relatively highly expressed in MKN45 (gastric cancer), HeLa S3 (cervical cancer), and K-562 (chronic myelogenous leukemia). Xenopus axis duplication assay revealed that the wild-type FRAT2 mRNA, but not the mutant FRAT2 mRNA lacking the acidic domain and the proline-rich domain, has the capacity to induce the secondary axis. These results indicate that FRAT2, just like FRAT1, functions as a positive regulator of the WNT signaling pathway. Thus, up-regulation of FRAT2 in human cancer might be implicated in carcinogenesis through activation of the WNT signaling pathway.","['Saitoh, T', 'Moriwaki, J', 'Koike, J', 'Takagi, A', 'Miwa, T', 'Shiokawa, K', 'Katoh, M']","['Saitoh T', 'Moriwaki J', 'Koike J', 'Takagi A', 'Miwa T', 'Shiokawa K', 'Katoh M']","['Genetics and Cell Biology Section, Genetics Division, National Cancer Center Research Institute, Tsukiji 5-chome, Tokyo, Chuo-ku, 104-0045, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Biochem Biophys Res Commun,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,0372516,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (FRAT1 protein, human)', '0 (FRAT2 protein, human)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Wnt Proteins)', '0 (Zebrafish Proteins)']",IM,"['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing', 'Amino Acid Sequence', '*Carrier Proteins', 'Chromosome Mapping', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'DNA, Complementary', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Humans', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins', 'Molecular Sequence Data', '*Neoplasm Proteins', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/chemistry/*genetics/*metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid', 'Signal Transduction/*genetics', 'Wnt Proteins', '*Zebrafish Proteins']",,2001/03/10 10:00,2001/04/21 10:01,['2001/03/10 10:00'],"['2001/03/10 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/04/21 10:01 [medline]', '2001/03/10 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Biochem Biophys Res Commun. 2001 Mar 2;281(3):815-20. doi: 10.1006/bbrc.2001.4421.,,['Copyright 2001 Academic Press.'],"['10.1006/bbrc.2001.4421 [doi]', 'S0006-291X(01)94421-3 [pii]']",,,,,,['GENBANK/AB045118'],,,,,,,,

However, tumor shrinkage requires chronic delivery of large doses of these proteins. Here we report synergistic antitumor activity and survival of animals when these factors are delivered in combination to tumors by retroviral gene transfer. We have demonstrated this efficacy in both murine leukemia and melanoma models. Complete loss of tumorigenicity was seen in 40% of the animals receiving tumors transduced by the combination of angiostatin and endostatin in the leukemia model. The synergy was also demonstrated in vitro on human umbilical vein endothelial cell differentiation and this antiangiogenic activity may suggest a mechanism for the antitumor activity in vivo. These findings imply separate pathways by which angiostatin and endostatin mediate their antiangiogenic effects. Together, these data suggest that a combination of antiangiogenic factors delivered by retroviral gene transfer may produce synergistic antitumor effects in both leukemia and solid tumors, thus avoiding long-term administration of recombinant proteins.

In order to determine in utero gene transfer efficiency and safety, studies were conducted with fetal rhesus monkeys as a model for the human. Included in these studies were Moloney murine leukemia virus (MLV)-based amphotropic retrovirus, vesicular stomatitis virus-G (VSV-G) pseudotyped MLV, and a VSV-G pseudotyped HIV-1-based vector, all expressing the enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) as a reporter gene and driven by a cytomegalovirus-immediate early promoter (N = 16). Rhesus monkey fetuses were administered viral vector supernatant preparations by the intraperitoneal (ip) (N = 14) or intrahepatic (ih) (N = 2) routes via ultrasound guidance at 55 +/- 5 days gestation (late first trimester; term 165 +/- 10 days). Fetuses were monitored sonographically, specimens were collected prenatally and postnatally, and tissue harvests were performed at birth or 3 or 6 months postnatal age (3-10 months post-gene transfer). PCR analyses demonstrated that transduced cells were present at approximately 1.2% in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from fetuses administered amphotropic MLV, <0.5% in fetuses receiving MLV/VSV-G, and approximately 4.2% for the lentiviral vector, which decreased to 2% at birth. Hematopoietic progenitors showed that overall (mean of all time points assessed), approximately 25% of the collected colonies were positive for the EGFP transgene with the lentiviral vector, which was significantly greater than results achieved with the MLV-based vector systems (4-9%; P < or = 0.001-0.016). At necropsy, 0.001-10% of the total genomic DNA was positive for EGFP in most tissues for all groups. EGFP-positive fluorescent cells were found in cell suspensions of thymus, liver, spleen, lymph nodes, cerebral cortex, and bone marrow (0.5-6%). Overall, the results of these studies have shown: (1) healthy infants expressing vector sequences up to 10 months post-gene transfer, (2) fetal primate administration of retroviral vectors results in gene transfer to multiple organ systems, (3) the highest level of gene transfer to hematopoietic progenitors was observed with the lentiviral vector system, and (4) there was no evidence of transplacental transfer of vector sequences into the dams. The rhesus monkey is an important preclinical primate model system for exploring gene transfer approaches for future applications in humans.","['Tarantal, A F', ""O'Rourke, J P"", 'Case, S S', 'Newbound, G C', 'Li, J', 'Lee, C I', 'Baskin, C R', 'Kohn, D B', 'Bunnell, B A']","['Tarantal AF', ""O'Rourke JP"", 'Case SS', 'Newbound GC', 'Li J', 'Lee CI', 'Baskin CR', 'Kohn DB', 'Bunnell BA']","['California Regional Primate Research Center, University of California at Davis, 95616-8542, USA. aftarantal@primate.ucdavis.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Mol Ther,Molecular therapy : the journal of the American Society of Gene Therapy,100890581,"['0 (G protein, vesicular stomatitis virus)', '0 (Luminescent Proteins)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)', '147336-22-9 (Green Fluorescent Proteins)', 'M801H13NRU (Azacitidine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Azacitidine/pharmacology', 'Cytomegalovirus/genetics', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', '*Gene Transfer Techniques', 'Genes, Reporter', 'Genetic Therapy/*methods', '*Genetic Vectors', 'Green Fluorescent Proteins', 'HIV-1/genetics', 'Humans', 'Lentivirus/genetics', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/metabolism', 'Luminescent Proteins/genetics', 'Macaca mulatta/embryology/*genetics', 'Male', '*Membrane Glycoproteins', 'Models, Genetic', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/genetics', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Retroviridae/*genetics', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Time Factors', 'Tissue Distribution', 'Viral Envelope Proteins/genetics']",,2001/03/10 10:00,2001/06/02 10:01,['2001/03/10 10:00'],"['2001/03/10 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/06/02 10:01 [medline]', '2001/03/10 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Mol Ther. 2001 Feb;3(2):128-38. doi: 10.1006/mthe.2000.0255.,,,"['10.1006/mthe.2000.0255 [doi]', 'S1525-0016(00)90255-7 [pii]']",,"['AI32266/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'HL55175/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'RR00169/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States']",,['Mol Ther. 2001 Feb;3(2):274-5.

This reaction is important for generation of the long terminal repeat sequences in the duplex DNA product of retroviral reverse transcription. Oligonucleotide-based model displacement constructs were used to study the interaction of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 and Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptases with the DNA. Under conditions where the DNA is saturated with enzyme, there is no protection against DNase I cleavage of the 5' single-stranded extension that would correspond to the already-displaced strand. However, the DNase I footprint on the non-template strand extends from the +1 to the +9 position for the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 enzyme and from +1 to +7 or +8 for the Moloney enzyme. This extent of protection on the non-template strand is similar to what was observed previously for the template strand downstream from the primer terminus. Use of potassium permanganate as a probe for unpaired bases in the region ahead of the primer terminus reveals that the two base-pairs immediately in front of the enzyme are melted by the bound enzyme. These findings are consistent with a displacement mechanism in which the reverse transcriptase plays an active role in unpairing the DNA ahead of the translocating polymerase. The results are interpreted in light of a recent crystal structure showing the nature of the protein-DNA contacts with the template strand ahead of the primer terminus.","['Winshell, J', 'Champoux, J J']","['Winshell J', 'Champoux JJ']","['Department of Microbiology, School of Medicine University of Washington, Seattle, WA 98195-7242, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,J Mol Biol,Journal of molecular biology,2985088R,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (DNA, Single-Stranded)', '0 (DNA, Viral)', '00OT1QX5U4 (Potassium Permanganate)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (HIV Reverse Transcriptase)', 'EC 3.1.21.1 (Deoxyribonuclease I)', 'VC2W18DGKR (Thymidine)']",IM,"['DNA Footprinting', 'DNA Primers/chemistry', 'DNA Replication', 'DNA, Single-Stranded/genetics/*metabolism', 'DNA, Viral/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Deoxyribonuclease I/metabolism', 'Genetic Vectors', 'HIV Reverse Transcriptase/genetics/*metabolism', 'HIV-1/enzymology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/enzymology', 'Nucleic Acid Conformation', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Potassium Permanganate/metabolism', 'Thymidine/chemistry']",,2001/03/10 10:00,2001/04/17 10:01,['2001/03/10 10:00'],"['2001/03/10 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/04/17 10:01 [medline]', '2001/03/10 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Mol Biol. 2001 Mar 9;306(5):931-43. doi: 10.1006/jmbi.2001.4439.,,,"['10.1006/jmbi.2001.4439 [doi]', 'S0022-2836(01)94439-0 [pii]']",,['CA51605/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,

Parameters are estimated for normal bone marrow cells and malignant cells in acute myelogenous leukemia (AML). This model explicitly includes the resting G(0)phase and the feedback mechanism that recruits the cells back into the cell cycle. Periodic chemotherapy administration can induce resonance within our model under high cell kill rate where the average cell cycle times may change during the course of treatment, and therapeutic benefits from these resonances cannot be solely based on cell cycle times in untreated tissue. The depletion rate under chemotherapy and the regrowth rate may differ between the cell populations, and our analysis suggests that this favors the tumour cells. We were able to distinguish between the effects of cycle-non-specific, S -phase-specific and M -phase-specific drugs, and found that these can show differences in sharpness and location of the resonance phenomenon.

Multiple genetic loci have been linked to Wilms tumorigenesis; positional cloning strategies have led to the identification of the WT1 tumor suppressor gene at chromosome 11p13. WT1 encodes a zinc finger transcription factor that is inactivated in the germline of children with genetic predisposition to Wilms tumor and in a subset of sporadic cancers. When present in the germline, specific heterozygous dominant-negative mutations are associated with severe abnormalities of renal and sexual differentiation, pointing to the essential role of WT1 for normal genitourinary development. The role of this tumor suppressor in normal organ-specific differentiation is also supported by the highly restricted temporal and spatial expression of WT1 in glomerular precursors of the developing kidney and by the failure of kidney development in wt1-null mice. Of two major alternative splicing products encoded by WT1, the (-KTS) isoform appears to mediate transcriptional activation of genes implicated in cellular differentiation, possibly also repressing proliferation-associated genes. The (+KTS) isoform, whose DNA-binding domain is disrupted by the insertion of three amino acids, may be involved in some aspect of mRNA processing. In addition to its function in genitourinary development, a role for WT1 in hematopoiesis is suggested by its aberrant expression and/or mutation in a subset of acute human leukemias.

However, the importance of increased DNA repair in resistant cells is becoming more apparent. In order to investigate the ability of the DNA repair inhibitor aphidicolin to modulate drug resistance, we continually exposed blasts cells, isolated from 22 patients with AML, to a variety of agents +/- 15 microM aphidicolin for 48 hours. Cell survival was measured using the MTT assay. Overall, there was no significant effect of aphidicolin on sensitivity to daunorubicin, doxorubicin, etoposide or fludarabine. However, there was a marked increase in sensitivity to ara-C with a median 4.75-fold increase overall (range 0.8-80-fold;P< 0.005). The effect of aphidicolin was significantly greater in blast cells found resistant in vitro to ara-C (8.9-fold compared to 2.12-fold, P< 0.01). This observation was further validated by the correlation between ara-C LC(50)and extent of modulation effect (P< 0.05). Cells isolated from 10 cord blood samples were also tested in order to establish the haematological toxicity of combining ara-C and aphidicolin. The therapeutic index (LC(50)normal cells/tumour cells) for ara-C + aphidicolin was higher than that for ara-C alone suggesting no increased myelotoxicity for the combination. Increased cytotoxicity without increased haematotoxicity makes the combination of ara-C plus aphidicolin ideal for inclusion in future clinical trials.","['Sargent, J M', 'Elgie, A W', 'Williamson, C J', 'Lewandowicz, G M', 'Taylor, C G']","['Sargent JM', 'Elgie AW', 'Williamson CJ', 'Lewandowicz GM', 'Taylor CG']","['Haematology Research, Pembury Hospital, Pembury, Kent, TN2 4QJ, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Cancer,British journal of cancer,0370635,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Formazans)', '0 (Tetrazolium Salts)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '23305-68-2 (MTT formazan)', '38966-21-1 (Aphidicolin)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",IM,"['Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/*pharmacology/toxicity', 'Aphidicolin/*pharmacology/toxicity', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cytarabine/*pharmacology/toxicity', 'DNA/analysis', '*Drug Resistance', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*pharmacology/toxicity', 'Fetal Blood/cytology/drug effects', 'Formazans/analysis', 'Humans', 'Lethal Dose 50', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/genetics', 'Tetrazolium Salts/analysis', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,2001/03/10 10:00,2001/04/21 10:01,['2001/03/10 10:00'],"['2001/03/10 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/04/21 10:01 [medline]', '2001/03/10 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Br J Cancer. 2001 Mar 2;84(5):680-5. doi: 10.1054/bjoc.2000.1639.,,['Copyright 2001 Cancer Research Campaign.'],"['10.1054/bjoc.2000.1639 [doi]', 'S0007092000916392 [pii]']",PMC2363802,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This group included 20 patients whose leukemic blast cells lacked chromosomal abnormalities detected by conventional cytogenetics and 10 patients whose blast cells had multiple chromosomal abnormalities that could not be completely identified by G-banding analysis. In two of the 20 patients (10%) with apparently normal karyotypes, SKY identified three cryptic translocations: a t(7;8)(q34-35;q24.1) in one patient and a t(13;17)(q22;q21) and a der(19)t(17;19)(q22;p13) in another. Fluorescence in situ hybridization using subtelomeric probes proved the latter translocation to be a t(17;19). SKY analysis was also successful in defining the nature of the chromosomal abnormalities in four of the 10 patients with marker and derivative chromosomes. The identified abnormalities in the latter group included three novel translocations: a der(X)t(X;5)(p11.4;q31), a der(21)t(X;21)(p11.4;p11.2) and a t(X;9)(p11.4;p13). The presence of the t(X;9) was suggested by conventional cytogenetics. The application of fluorescence in situ hybridization using chromosome-specific painting probes and locus-specific probes complemented the SKY analysis by confirming the nature of the chromosome rearrangements defined by SKY and by identifying the amplification of the AML1/CBFA2 gene in one patient with a duplicated 21q. Our study demonstrates the utility of SKY in identifying novel translocations and in refining the identity of chromosomal abnormalities in leukemias.","['Mathew, S', 'Rao, P H', 'Dalton, J', 'Downing, J R', 'Raimondi, S C']","['Mathew S', 'Rao PH', 'Dalton J', 'Downing JR', 'Raimondi SC']","[""Department of Pathology, St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN 38105-2794, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Infant', 'Karyotyping/*methods', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics', '*Translocation, Genetic']",,2001/03/10 10:00,2001/04/03 10:01,['2001/03/10 10:00'],"['2001/03/10 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/04/03 10:01 [medline]', '2001/03/10 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2001 Mar;15(3):468-72. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2401989.,,,['10.1038/sj.leu.2401989 [doi]'],,"['CA-20180/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-21765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,

In the adult human, this task is relinquished to the bone marrow. However, under the stress of certain pathologic conditions, extramedullary hemopoiesis may again occur in the spleen. This is especially true for diseases of the marrow, in particular, myeloproliferative disorders such as agnogenic myeloid metaplasia, which is associated with severe fibrosis of the marrow space. At the same time, the spleen sequesters blood cells and contributes to peripheral blood cytopenias, which may improve following splenectomy. However, success is unpredictable, and the operative mortality of splenectomy is on the order of 10%. As a growing number of patients undergo hemopoietic stem cell transplantation as definitive therapy for myelofibrosis, the decision on splenectomy has additional ramifications since the spleen plays an important role in the kinetics of engraftment of donor cells and in immune reconstitution. We conclude from our analysis of available information that the benefit of splenectomy is difficult to predict, although after transplantation splenectomized patients have faster hemopoietic recovery. It appears that the most important indication for splenectomy in these patients is the relief of symptoms from massive spleen enlargement.","['Li, Z', 'Deeg, H J']","['Li Z', 'Deeg HJ']","['Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center and the University of Washington, Seattle 98109, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Combined Modality Therapy', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Middle Aged', 'Primary Myelofibrosis/*surgery/*therapy', '*Splenectomy/adverse effects', 'Treatment Outcome']",,2001/03/10 10:00,2001/04/03 10:01,['2001/03/10 10:00'],"['2001/03/10 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/04/03 10:01 [medline]', '2001/03/10 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2001 Mar;15(3):465-7. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2402043.,,,['10.1038/sj.leu.2402043 [doi]'],,"['CA18029/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA87948/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL36444/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,

To test whether this biological prognostic factor is more important in predicting clinical outcome than histological diagnosis or clinical factors, we compared the prognostic value of these parameters in an expanded group of classical HD and ALK negative ALCL. Tumor biopsies of classical HD (n = 83) and ALK negative systemic nodal ALCL (n = 43) were investigated for the presence of activated CTLs by immunohistochemistry, using a monoclonal antibody directed against granzyme B. Percentages of activated CTLs were quantified using Q-PRODIT, and their prognostic value was compared to that of histological diagnosis and clinical parameters, including age and stage. Both in classical HD and ALK negative ALCL, a high percentage of activated CTLs (ie > or = 15%) identified a group of patients with poor overall and progression-free survival time, even when adjusted for stage. In multivariate analysis, percentage of activated CTLs remained a strong independent prognostic marker, and was more sensitive than histological diagnosis or clinical factors in predicting overall survival time. We conclude that a high percentage of activated CTLs in the reactive infiltrate of ALK negative ALCL and classical HD is a strong indicator for an unfavorable clinical outcome, regardless of histological diagnosis or clinical parameters. As such, this biological parameter may be an especially helpful tool to determine therapeutic strategies in cases in which the differentiation between ALK negative ALCL and HD remains difficult.","['ten Berge, R L', 'Oudejans, J J', 'Dukers, D F', 'Meijer, J W', 'Ossenkoppele, G J', 'Meijer, C J']","['ten Berge RL', 'Oudejans JJ', 'Dukers DF', 'Meijer JW', 'Ossenkoppele GJ', 'Meijer CJ']","['Department of Pathology, University Hospital Vrije Universiteit, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', 'EC 3.4.21.- (GZMB protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.21.- (Granzymes)', 'EC 3.4.21.- (Serine Endopeptidases)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*analysis', 'Child', 'Female', 'Granzymes', 'Hodgkin Disease/*immunology/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse/*immunology/metabolism', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', 'Serine Endopeptidases/metabolism', 'Survival Analysis', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/*immunology/metabolism']",,2001/03/10 10:00,2001/04/03 10:01,['2001/03/10 10:00'],"['2001/03/10 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/04/03 10:01 [medline]', '2001/03/10 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2001 Mar;15(3):458-64. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2402045.,,,['10.1038/sj.leu.2402045 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The averages of the ongoing mutation rate of CD5+ DLBCL (four cases) and CD5 DLBCL (seven cases) were 0.051% and 0.197%, respectively. The rate of CD5+ DLBCL was significantly lower than that of CD5- DLBCL (t-test, P = 0.024). These data may indicate that the cell origin of CD5+ DLBCL is different from that of CD5- DLBCL.

After a median follow-up of 43 months (range, 15-106), none of the responding patients had clinical or MRD relapse.

Disruption of the interaction between components of the red cell membrane skeleton may cause loss of structural and functional integrity of the membrane. Several observations based on studies in vitro strongly suggest that phosphorylation may modify interactions between proteins, leading to a reduced affinity. In particular, increased phosphorylation of beta-spectrin decreases membrane mechanical stability. In order to investigate the presence of membrane protein defects we investigated the erythrocyte membrane protein composition and phosphorylation in 22 children with leukemia at diagnosis and during the remission phase. Sixteen children had acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), three had chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) and three had acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Ten patients (eight ALL and two CML) displayed elliptocytosis and poikilocytosis, an increase of spectrin dimers (41.8 +/- 15.6) and an enhanced phosphorylation of beta-spectrin (108 +/- 15%) at diagnosis. These alterations disappeared during the remission phase. This is the first demonstration of a reversible erythrocyte membrane alteration in leukemia. Since the beta-spectrin phosphate sites are located near the C-terminal region and close to the head of the beta-chain that is involved in dimer-dimer interaction, we supposed that the beta-chain phosphorylation has an effect upon the interactions between spectrin dimers, ie the tetramerization process. The weakening of this process should be responsible for the presence of elliptocytes and poikilocytes as reported in hereditary elliptocytosis and pyropoikilocytosis.","['Perrotta, S', 'del Giudice, E M', 'Iolascon, A', 'De Vivo, M', 'Di Pinto, D', 'Cutillo, S', 'Nobili, B']","['Perrotta S', 'del Giudice EM', 'Iolascon A', 'De Vivo M', 'Di Pinto D', 'Cutillo S', 'Nobili B']","['Dipartimento di Pediatria, II Universita di Napoli, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,['12634-43-4 (Spectrin)'],IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Autoradiography', 'Child', 'Erythrocytes/*ultrastructure', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*blood', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*blood', 'Male', 'Phosphorylation', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*blood', 'Remission Induction', 'Spectrin/*metabolism']",,2001/03/10 10:00,2001/04/03 10:01,['2001/03/10 10:00'],"['2001/03/10 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/04/03 10:01 [medline]', '2001/03/10 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2001 Mar;15(3):440-4. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2402047.,,,['10.1038/sj.leu.2402047 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The aim of the present study was to explore in a homogeneous group of 22 uniformly treated breast cancer patients: (1) the kinetics of mobilization into PB of both CD34+ and CD34- cell subsets, including dendritic cells, in sequential samples obtained from day +7 up to day +12 after mobilization; and (2) the composition of the CD34+ and CD34- cell subsets present in the two leukapheresis products obtained for each patient. The following CD34+ and CD34- subsets were analyzed: early CD34+ HPC, erythroid-, myeloid- and B-lymphoid-committed CD34+ precursor cells, mature T, B and NK cells, monocytes, neutrophils, eosinophils, basophils, and dendritic cells (DC) including three subsets of lin-/HLADR+DC (CD16+, CD33high and CD123high). Our results show that the absolute number of PB CD34+ HPC progressively increases from day +7 onwards. As far as the CD34- PB leukocyte subsets are concerned, monocytes (CD14+) displayed the earliest recovery after mobilization predicting neutrophil recovery 1 day in advance. The number of CD34+ HPC collected in a single leukapheresis product was always > or = 1.4 x 10(6) cells/kg body weight. No significant changes were observed between the two leukapheresis sessions either as regards their composition in CD34+ HPC subsets or their CD34- leukocyte populations except for a higher ratio of both CD34+ erythroid/CD34+ myeloid HPC (0.35 +/- 0.13 vs 0.30 +/- 0.13; P = 0.04) and neutrophils/monocytes (1.58 +/- 2.1 vs 0.69 +/- 0.27; P = 0.009) found for the first leukapheresis. Interestingly, the overall number of dendritic cells (DC) was higher in the second leukapheresis (1.06 +/- 0.56 vs 1.9 +/- 0.46; P = 0.02) due to a selective increase of the CD16+ antigen-presenting cells. In summary, our results show that the combination of cyclophosphamide, G-CSF and SCF is highly effective for stem cell mobilization, with differences observed in the mobilization kinetics of the different hematopoietic cell subsets analyzed.","['Menendez, P', 'Prosper, F', 'Bueno, C', 'Arbona, C', 'San Miguel, J F', 'Garcia-Conde, J', 'Sola, C', 'Hornedo, J', 'Cortes-Funes, H', 'Orfao, A']","['Menendez P', 'Prosper F', 'Bueno C', 'Arbona C', 'San Miguel JF', 'Garcia-Conde J', 'Sola C', 'Hornedo J', 'Cortes-Funes H', 'Orfao A']","['Departamento de Medicina and Centro de Investigaciones del Cancer, Universidad de Salamanca, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Stem Cell Factor)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antigens, CD34/*blood', 'Breast Neoplasms/drug therapy/*immunology', 'Cyclophosphamide/*administration & dosage', 'Female', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/*administration & dosage', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Mobilization', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukapheresis', 'Middle Aged', 'Recombinant Proteins', 'Stem Cell Factor/*administration & dosage']",,2001/03/10 10:00,2001/04/03 10:01,['2001/03/10 10:00'],"['2001/03/10 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/04/03 10:01 [medline]', '2001/03/10 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2001 Mar;15(3):430-9. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2402051.,,,['10.1038/sj.leu.2402051 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, conflicting data were reported about chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) progenitors. We investigated the responsiveness of purified CML CFU-GM to GM-CSF/IL3 and their survival to growth factor deprivation. CFU-GM hypersensitivity to IL3 and/or GM-CSF was found in 3/11 CML cases only. CML CFU-GM survived well in stroma-free 'mass' culture (5 x 10(4) cells/ml) without cytokine addition, up to day 11, average recovery being around 95% in medium + 10% fetal bovine serum and 67-81% in serum-free medium. Conversely, normal progenitors declined steadily, particularly after extensive purification (18 +/- 10% recovery at the 7th day), and in serum-free medium (4 +/- 6% recovery). By contrast, normal and CML CFU-GM declined in a similar way in limiting dilution cultures (1-10 cells/50 microl). We also investigated the effects of retinoic acid and alpha-interferon on CFU-GM survival. Both all-trans- and 13-cis retinoic acid, particularly in combination with alpha-interferon, reduced CML CFU-GM recovery down to normal progenitors' values. In conclusion, hypersensitivity to CSFs is rare in CML, whereas resistance to growth factor deprivation has been confirmed in mass, but not in limiting, dilution cultures. Both stereoisomers of retinoic acid, at therapeutic concentrations and in combination with alpha-interferon, can overcome the survival advantage of CML progenitors.","['Ferrero, D', 'Foli, C', 'Giaretta, F', 'Argentino, C', 'Rus, C', 'Pileri, A']","['Ferrero D', 'Foli C', 'Giaretta F', 'Argentino C', 'Rus C', 'Pileri A']","[""Divisione di Ematologia dell'Universita di Torino, Azienda Ospedaliera S Giovanni Battista, Italy.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Interferon-alpha)', '0 (Interleukin-3)', '0 (Retinoids)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",IM,"['*Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Interferon-alpha/*pharmacology', 'Interleukin-3/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia/*pathology', 'Retinoids/*pharmacology']",,2001/03/10 10:00,2001/04/03 10:01,['2001/03/10 10:00'],"['2001/03/10 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/04/03 10:01 [medline]', '2001/03/10 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2001 Mar;15(3):422-9. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2402038.,,,['10.1038/sj.leu.2402038 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The aim of the present study was to explore the immunophenotypic characteristics of precursor B-ALL cases displaying BCR/ABL gene rearrangements using multiple stainings analyzed by quantitative flow cytometry in order to rapidly (<1 h) identify unique phenotypes associated with this translocation. From the 82 precursor-B-ALL cases included in the study 12 displayed BCR/ABL gene rearragements, all corresponding to adult patients, four of which also displayed DNA aneuploidy. Our results show that BCR/ABL+ precursor B-ALL cases constantly displayed a homogeneous expression of CD10 and CD34 but low and relatively heterogeneous CD38 expression, together with an aberrant reactivity for CD13. In contrast, this unique phenotype was only detected in three out of 70 BCR/ABL cases.

Other prognostic factors, such as specific cytogenetic abnormalities, have been identified in AML. We have investigated the expression of the MDR1 gene in untreated AML patients with monosomy 7 (n = 12), and partial deletions (n = 7) of the long arm of chromosome 7 (respectively -7/7q-), because of the extremely bad prognosis associated with these cytogenetic abnormalities and because of the fact that the MDR1 gene is located on chromosome 7q21.1. The findings were compared with the level of MDR1 expression in a group of 42 other AML patients, matched for age with favourable, neutral or complex cytogenetic abberations. MDR1 mRNA expression, as measured by the RNase protection assay was significantly higher in the -7/7q- group vs other AML patients (median 1.3 vs 0.1 arbitrary units, P = 0.02). Protein expression of MDR1 in the -7/7q- group, as determined with the monoclonal antibody MRK16, was found to be similar to the levels found in the control group. With a functional rhodamine retention assay using the modulator PSC833, increased MDR1 activity was observed in the -7/7q- group as compared to the control group of patients (P = 0.05). Considering the higher MDR1 mRNA expression and equal or slightly elevated level of protein expression of MDR1, we studied the presence of MDR1 genes in this group of -7/7q- patients. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) studies, using a specific MDR1 probe revealed no loss of an MDR1 allele in any of the deleted q- arms of the seven patients with 7q-, whereas all monosomy 7 patients lacked one MDR1 gene homologue. To determine whether there was selective loss of the MDR1 gene in the -7/7q- patients, the genetic polymorphism of the MDR1 gene was used. Both allelic variants (G and T) were represented in the -7/7q- and in the control group, showing a predominance for GT at position 2677 of the MDR1 gene in the control group. In the 12 monosomy 7 patients loss of the MDR1 allele was random. Methylation studies of the CpG island of the MDR1 gene revealed no hypermethylation in any of the -7/7q- patients. We conclude that MDR1 expression in -7/7q- AML patients is upregulated at transcriptional, but not at translational level, suggesting that mechanisms other than MDR1 are responsible for the poor prognosis in these patients.","['van den Heuvel-Eibrink, M M', 'Wiemer, E A', 'de Boevere, M J', 'Slater, R M', 'Smit, E M', 'van Noesel, M M', 'van der Holt, B', 'Schoester, M', 'Pieters, R', 'Sonneveld, P']","['van den Heuvel-Eibrink MM', 'Wiemer EA', 'de Boevere MJ', 'Slater RM', 'Smit EM', 'van Noesel MM', 'van der Holt B', 'Schoester M', 'Pieters R', 'Sonneveld P']","['Department of Hematology, University Hospital and Erasmus University, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/*genetics', 'Acute Disease', 'Alleles', 'Base Sequence', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 7', 'DNA Primers', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*genetics', 'Middle Aged', '*Monosomy', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics']",,2001/03/10 10:00,2001/04/03 10:01,['2001/03/10 10:00'],"['2001/03/10 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/04/03 10:01 [medline]', '2001/03/10 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2001 Mar;15(3):398-405. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2402027.,,,['10.1038/sj.leu.2402027 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The study group comprised 38 children aged 1-15 with Philadelphia-negative B-lineage ALL who were uniformly treated and followed until relapse or for a minimum of 5 years. We also studied some of the technical factors which influence the ability to detect MRD. Measurement of blast percentage on day 14 by an expert morphologist, detection of monoclonality on day 35, and PCR-based measurement of MRD levels on days 14 and 35 all showed significant ability to divide patients into prognostic groups. Measurement of blast percentage on day 14 by routine morphology or detection of monoclonality on day 14 were not useful. The quality of DNA samples varied greatly, as determined by amplifiability in the PCR. However, virtually all amplifiable leukemic targets in a sample were detectable which suggests that the level of detection achieved by limiting dilution analysis is essentially determined by the amount of DNA which it is practicable to study. We conclude that quantification of MRD at the end of induction provides the full range of prognostic information for marrow relapse but is complex; detection of monoclonality on day 35 is simple and has good positive predictive value; and quantification of MRD on day 14 merits further study.

A sixth patient harbored a smaller deletion, slightly more telomeric than minimal deleted regions reported in B-CLL.

Our present findings suggest that at least some of its exons lie within a region of less than 100 kb more telomeric that previously thought.","['Cave, H', 'Avet-Loiseau, H', 'Devaux, I', 'Rondeau, G', 'Boutard, P', 'Lebrun, E', 'Mechinaud, F', 'Vilmer, E', 'Grandchamp, B']","['Cave H', 'Avet-Loiseau H', 'Devaux I', 'Rondeau G', 'Boutard P', 'Lebrun E', 'Mechinaud F', 'Vilmer E', 'Grandchamp B']","['Laboratoire de Biochimie Genetique, H pital Robert Debre, INSERM U409, Faculte de Medecine Xavier Bichat, Paris, France.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,['0 (DNA Primers)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Base Sequence', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', '*Chromosome Deletion', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 13', 'DNA Primers', 'Genotype', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Infant', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics']",,2001/03/10 10:00,2001/04/03 10:01,['2001/03/10 10:00'],"['2001/03/10 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/04/03 10:01 [medline]', '2001/03/10 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2001 Mar;15(3):371-6. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2402052.,,,['10.1038/sj.leu.2402052 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We investigated the biological and transcriptional consequences of forced expression of E2a-Pbx1 in the interleukin-3 (IL-3) dependent, bone marrow-derived cell line Ba/F3. We show that forced expression of E2a-Pbx1 induces apoptosis in Ba/F3 cells without apparent effects on cell cycle progression. This pro-apoptotic effect is enhanced on cytokine deprivation. Furthermore, using cDNA representational difference analysis (RDA), we show that these cellular effects are associated with marked induction of the gene NDRG1, which was previously identified as a target of transcriptional repression by N-myc and induction by the tumor suppressor protein p53. We identify a portion of the NDRG1 promoter capable of mediating transcriptional induction by E2a-Pbx1 and show that NDRG1 is also induced on simple IL-3 deprivation of BaF3 cells. Although we show that E2a-Pbx1 induction of NDRG1 is not impaired as a result of targeting p53 using HPV E6, and therefore does not appear to be p53-dependent, our results overall are consistent with the notion that induction of NDRG1 by E2a-Pbx1 may represent part of an apoptotic or cytostatic cellular response to oncogene activation.","['Rutherford, M N', 'Bayly, G R', 'Matthews, B P', 'Okuda, T', 'Dinjens, W M', 'Kondoh, H', 'LeBrun, D P']","['Rutherford MN', 'Bayly GR', 'Matthews BP', 'Okuda T', 'Dinjens WM', 'Kondoh H', 'LeBrun DP']","[""Department of Pathology, Queen's University, Kingston, Ontario, Canada.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (N-myc downstream-regulated gene 1 protein)', '0 (Nerve Tissue Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '146150-85-8 (E2A-Pbx1 fusion protein)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/physiology', '*Cell Cycle Proteins', 'Cell Line', 'Gene Expression Regulation/*physiology', 'Homeodomain Proteins/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins', 'Nerve Tissue Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*physiology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc/*metabolism', 'Regulatory Sequences, Nucleic Acid', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/*metabolism']",,2001/03/10 10:00,2001/04/03 10:01,['2001/03/10 10:00'],"['2001/03/10 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/04/03 10:01 [medline]', '2001/03/10 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2001 Mar;15(3):362-70. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2402059.,,,['10.1038/sj.leu.2402059 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Five patients received DLI after CT as consolidation and one patient as frontline therapy. Five patients received a second SCT. Median overall survival after relapse was 2 months for the untreated patients, 2 months for patients receiving CT only, 2 months in patients after cessation of IS, 17 months in DLI treated patients and three months in patients receiving a second SCT. Fourteen patients achieved remission after relapse. Two with CT (2, 2 months), three with SI (3, 19, 19+ months), six with DLI (3, 8, 9, 14, 20, 36 months) and three with second SCT (2, 4, 6 months).

Results showed a significant better blast cell reduction in the bone marrow on day 15 in patients of the idarubicin arm (25 of 144 = 17% of patients with > or = 5% blasts compared to 46 of 149 = 31% of patients after daunorubicin, Pchi2 = 0.01).

Cardiotoxicity, WHO grade 1-3 shortening fraction reduction after induction occurred in 6% patients in both arms. Bone marrow toxicity differed slightly with a median recovery time of neutrophils >500/microl of 25 days (daunorubicin) compared to 27 days (idarubicin), P = 0.05. In the total group of patients probabilities of 5 years event-free survival and disease-free survival were similar for patients treated with daunorubicin or idarubicin (49% +/- 4% vs 55% +/- 4% and 57% +/- 4% vs 64% +/- 4%, P logrank 0.29 and 0.15, respectively). However, in patients presenting with more than 5% blasts on day 15 there was a trend for a better outcome after treatment with idarubicin (P logrank 0.06).

Combination therapy may increase this proportion. We tested whether combinations of STI571 and cytarabine or other chemotherapeutic agents such as hydroxyurea, mafosfamide or etoposide would display synergistic activity in BCR-ABL-positive chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) cell lines derived from patients in blast crisis. In addition, the toxicity of these combinations on BCR-ABL-negative cells was investigated. A tetrazolium-based MTT assay was used to quantity growth inhibition after 48 h of exposure to cytotoxic agents alone and in simultaneous combination with STI571. The drug interactions were analyzed using the median-effect method of Chou and Talalay. The combination index (CI) was calculated according to the classic isobologram equation. At growth inhibition levels of over 50%, STI571 + cytarabine as well as STI571 + etoposide were significantly synergistic (CI < 1, P < 0.05) in the BCR-ABL-positive cell lines evaluated. At 60% inhibition or higher, a similar synergistic pattern became apparent for STI571 + mafosfamide (P < 0.05), while STI571 + hydroxyurea showed ambiguous, cell line-dependent synergism (BV173), additivity (EM-3) or antagonism (K562) in CML cell lines. Furthermore, the BCR-ABL-negative HL-60, KG1a and normal CD34+ progenitor cells were not affected by 0.8 microM STI571, a concentration which produced more than 50% growth inhibition in all BCR-ABL-positive cells tested, and no potentiation of growth inhibition was observed in these BCR-ABL-negative cells when STI571 was combined with chemotherapeutic agents.

This progressive disappearance of T cells leads to a lack of immune control of HIV replication and to the development of immune deficiency resulting in the increased occurrence of opportunistic infections associated with acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS). The HIV-induced, premature destruction of lymphocytes is associated with the continuous production of HIV viral proteins that modulate apoptotic pathways. The viral proteins, such as Tat, Env, and Nef, are associated with chronic immune activation and the continuous induction of apoptotic factors. Viral protein expression predisposes lymphocytes, particularly CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells, and antigen-presenting cells, to evolve into effectors of apoptosis and as a result, to lead to the destruction of healthy, non-infected T cells. Tat and Nef, along with Vpu, can also protect HIV-infected cells from apoptosis by increasing anti-apoptotic proteins and down-regulating cell surface receptors recognized by immune system cells.

We have explored the impact of a novel approach for the quantitative determination of chimerism using a commercial PCR assay with multiplex amplification of nine STR-loci and fluorescence detection. The feasibility was studied in 121 patients transplanted from related or unrelated donors. Follow-up investigation was performed in 88 patients. Twenty-eight of these patients had received a transplantation after dose-reduced conditioning therapy. Results were compared to data obtained by FISH analysis in a subgroup of patients receiving grafts from sex-mismatched donors. The analysis was possible in all patients, the median number of informative alleles was 4 (range 1-8) compared to 7 (range 1-9) in the related and unrelated situation, respectively. A good correlation was seen in 84 samples from 14 patients analyzed in parallel with STR-PCR and FISH. Decreasing values of donor chimerism were detected prior to or concomitantly with the occurrence of graft failure and relapse of disease in all patients investigated prospectively. Using FACS-sorted material, eg peripheral blood CD34+ cells, the assay permitted the detection of residual recipient cells with high sensitivity (down to one CD34+ Kasumi cell in 40,000 normal WBC).

Since myeloma cells localize and accumulate in bone marrow, it is important to understand the influence of the bone marrow microenvironment not only on the growth of the malignant cells, but also on the therapeutic response of myeloma cells. Growth factors such as interleukin-6 (IL-6) produced by bone marrow stromal cells can protect myeloma cells from glucocorticoid-induced apoptosis. We examined the effect of myeloma cells-bone marrow stromal cells interaction in vitro on several therapeutic treatments. An interleukin-6-dependent myeloma cell line ANBL6 was used and treated with dexamethasone, doxorubicin, and melphalan in the presence of bone marrow stromal cells. Stromal cells were able to protect ANBL6 from dexamethasone, but significantly enhanced the effect of doxorubicin and melphalan. IL-6-induced bcl-XL and cyclin D2 expression in ANBL6 cells, but dexamethasone was able to suppress both bcl-XL and cyclin D2 expression in ANBL6. Doxorubicin and melphalan were able to suppress bcl-XL expression only in the presence of IL-6. We also looked at the effect of activating mutations of N-ras in myeloma cells interacting with stromal cells on therapeutic responses. Surprisingly, ANBL6 N-ras shows significant resistance to all drugs used. Notably, the presence of stromal cells did not alter ANBL6 Nras cells' drug resistance. These results suggest both the bone marrow microenvironment and genetic alterations of myeloma cells can independently impact on therapeutic responses.","['Cheung, W C', 'Van Ness, B']","['Cheung WC', 'Van Ness B']","['Graduate Program in Biochemistry, Molecular Biology, and Biophysics, The University of Minnesota, Minneapolis 55455, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Interleukin-6)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', 'Q41OR9510P (Melphalan)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Bone Marrow/*pathology', 'Dexamethasone/administration & dosage', 'Doxorubicin/administration & dosage', 'Genes, ras', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-6/administration & dosage', 'Melphalan/administration & dosage', 'Multiple Myeloma/*drug therapy/genetics/pathology', 'Mutation', 'Stromal Cells/*pathology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,2001/03/10 10:00,2001/04/03 10:01,['2001/03/10 10:00'],"['2001/03/10 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/04/03 10:01 [medline]', '2001/03/10 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2001 Feb;15(2):264-71. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2402022.,,,['10.1038/sj.leu.2402022 [doi]'],,"['CA21115/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA62242/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Autograft was the final part of a hd-sequential (HDS) chemotherapy program, including a debulkying phase (1-2 APO +/- 2 DHAP courses) and then sequential administration of hd-cyclophosphamide, methotrexate (or Ara-C) and etoposide, at 10 to 30 day intervals. Autograft phase included: (1) hd-MITO, given at 60 mg/m2 on day -5; (2) hd-L-PAM, given at 180 mg/m2 on day -2; (3) PBPC autograft, with a median of 11 x 10(6) CD34+/kg, or 70 x 10(4) CFU-GM/kg, on day 0. A rapid hematological recovery was observed in most patients, with ANC >500/microL and Plt >20,000/microl values reached at a median of 11 and 10 days since autograft, respectively. The good hemopoietic reconstitution allowed the delivery of consolidation radiotherapy (RT) to bulky sites in 53 out of 57 candidate patients, within 1 to 3 months following autograft; five of these patients required back-up PBPC re-infusion due to severe post-RT pancytopenia. Few severe infectious complications were recorded. There was one single fatal event due to severe pancytopenia following whole abdomen RT. Cardiac toxicity was evaluated as left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), monitored by cardiac radionuclide scan. LVEF prior to and after autograft was significantly reduced (median values: 55% vs 46%) in 58 evaluated patients; however, a significant increase to a median value of 50% was observed in 45 patients evaluated at 1 to 3 years since autograft. At a median follow-up of 3.6 years, 92 patients are alive, with a 7-year overall survival projection and 6.7-year failure-free survival projection of 77% and 69%, respectively. We conclude that a conditioning regimen with hd-MITOIL-PAM fits well within the HDS program. It implies good tolerability and reversible cardiotoxicity and it may have contributed to the good long-term outcome observed in this series of patients.","['Tarella, C', 'Zallio, F', 'Caracciolo, D', 'Cuttica, A', 'Corradini, P', 'Gavarotti, P', 'Ladetto, M', 'Podio, V', 'Sargiotto, A', 'Rossi, G', 'Gianni, A M', 'Pileri, A']","['Tarella C', 'Zallio F', 'Caracciolo D', 'Cuttica A', 'Corradini P', 'Gavarotti P', 'Ladetto M', 'Podio V', 'Sargiotto A', 'Rossi G', 'Gianni AM', 'Pileri A']","['Dipartimento di Medicina e Oncologia Sperimentale, Ospedaliera S Giovanni Battista di Torino, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['BZ114NVM5P (Mitoxantrone)', 'Q41OR9510P (Melphalan)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Female', 'Heart Ventricles/*drug effects', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma/*therapy', 'Male', 'Melphalan/administration & dosage', 'Middle Aged', 'Mitoxantrone/*administration & dosage', 'Retrospective Studies', '*Transplantation Conditioning', 'Treatment Outcome']",,2001/03/10 10:00,2001/04/03 10:01,['2001/03/10 10:00'],"['2001/03/10 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/04/03 10:01 [medline]', '2001/03/10 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2001 Feb;15(2):256-63. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2402011.,,,['10.1038/sj.leu.2402011 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Such DCs could be differentiated from 77% of AML patients, irrespective of their FAB classification and clinical status and, in all cases tested, the DCs were shown to derive from the leukemic clone by FISH analysis. Importantly, from >60% of AML patients, autologous T lymphocytes stimulated with these in vitro generated leukemic DCs displayed specific cytotoxic activity against AML blasts but low reactivity against autologous non-leukemic targets and HLA-matched normal PBMNCs therefore suggesting that the CTLs were AML-specific. The use of FLT3 ligand in our system resulted in a significantly higher number of leukemic DCs as compared to cultures from which FLT3 ligand was omitted which is obviously advantageous if large numbers of specific CTLs are to be generated in the shortest possible time.","['Woiciechowsky, A', 'Regn, S', 'Kolb, H J', 'Roskrow, M']","['Woiciechowsky A', 'Regn S', 'Kolb HJ', 'Roskrow M']","['Klinische Kooperationsgruppe Hamatopoetische Zelltransplantation, Klinikum Grosshadern, Universitat Munchen and GSF, National Research Centre for Environment & Health, Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (flt3 ligand protein)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Dendritic Cells/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/immunology/*pathology', 'Lymphocyte Culture Test, Mixed', 'Membrane Proteins/*immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/*immunology']",,2001/03/10 10:00,2001/04/03 10:01,['2001/03/10 10:00'],"['2001/03/10 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/04/03 10:01 [medline]', '2001/03/10 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2001 Feb;15(2):246-55. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2402013.,,,['10.1038/sj.leu.2402013 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In contrast, normal human bone marrow CD34+ cells and normal peripheral blood lymphocytes were resistant to the antisense-mediated cell death. We found that antisense-treated HL-60 cells had prominent nuclear fragmentations but lacked apoptotic features including internucleosomal DNA cleavage and TUNEL positivity. Cell cycle analysis demonstrated a remarkable reduction in G1 phase population along with a mild accumulation of S phase and good preservation of G2/M phase, indicating cells died at G2/M without cycling into G1 phase. None of the sense-sequenced PS-ODNs induced cell death. Further, neither the expression nor the message of CREB protein was reduced by antisense treatment, indicating that cell death was mediated by a non-antisense mechanism. On the other hand, no consensus oligonucleotide sequence for cell death induction was detected. Rather, we found a good correlation between the melting temperatures and the anti-proliferative activities of the oligonucleotides. Thus, CREB antisense PS-ODNs selectively induce a non-apoptotic cell death in leukemic cells by an unknown hybridization-dependent mechanism.","['Saeki, K', 'Yuo, A', 'Koizumi, M', 'Fujiwara, K', 'Kaneko, M', 'Takaku, F', 'Yazaki, Y']","['Saeki K', 'Yuo A', 'Koizumi M', 'Fujiwara K', 'Kaneko M', 'Takaku F', 'Yazaki Y']","['Department of Hematology, Research Institute, International Medical Center of Japan, Tokyo.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Cyclic AMP Response Element-Binding Protein)', '0 (Oligonucleotides, Antisense)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD34/immunology', 'Base Sequence', 'Bone Marrow Cells/cytology/*drug effects/immunology', 'Cell Death/*drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cyclic AMP Response Element-Binding Protein/*genetics', 'In Situ Nick-End Labeling', 'Leukemia/*pathology', 'Oligonucleotides, Antisense/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,2001/03/10 10:00,2001/04/03 10:01,['2001/03/10 10:00'],"['2001/03/10 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/04/03 10:01 [medline]', '2001/03/10 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2001 Feb;15(2):238-45. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2402014.,,,['10.1038/sj.leu.2402014 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Notably, white blood cells (WBCs) from B-CLL patients contain 18, 22 and 24 kDa isoforms of FGF-2 whereas WBCs from CML patients contain only the 24 kDa isoform. Furthermore, as cultured B-CLL WBCs release 18 kDa FGF-2 into the medium, they constitute a potential source of FGF-2 in the blood. In a receptor binding assay, 125I-FGF-2 binds weakly to B-CLL WBCs, whereas the ligand binds more strongly to CML WBCs. Correspondingly, FGF-2 is unable to activate mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK) and its substrate, extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), in B-CLL cells, whereas phosphorylation of both these cell growth-related kinases increases following treatment of CML WBCs. We conclude that B-CLL WBCs secrete FGF-2 with no apparent autocrine actions. In contrast, WBCs in CML bind FGF-2 provided by other FGF-2-hyperproducing cells and activate the MEK/ERK kinase cascade, possibly to modulate cell growth.","['Krejci, P', 'Dvorakova, D', 'Krahulcova, E', 'Pachernik, J', 'Mayer, J', 'Hampl, A', 'Dvorak, P']","['Krejci P', 'Dvorakova D', 'Krahulcova E', 'Pachernik J', 'Mayer J', 'Hampl A', 'Dvorak P']","['Laboratory of Molecular Embryology, Mendel University Brno, Czech Republic.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Culture Media, Conditioned)', '0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Fibroblast Growth Factor)', '103107-01-3 (Fibroblast Growth Factor 2)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Base Sequence', 'Culture Media, Conditioned', 'DNA Primers', 'Female', 'Fibroblast Growth Factor 2/*blood/chemistry', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*blood', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*blood', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Molecular Weight', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Receptors, Fibroblast Growth Factor/genetics']",,2001/03/10 10:00,2001/04/03 10:01,['2001/03/10 10:00'],"['2001/03/10 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/04/03 10:01 [medline]', '2001/03/10 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2001 Feb;15(2):228-37. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2402012.,,,['10.1038/sj.leu.2402012 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have previously shown that IFN-gamma restores phorbol ester-induced differentiation and cell cycle arrest in v-myc transformed human U-937 monoblasts. To investigate whether other cytokine signals could also abrogate such a block, IL-1, IL-3, IL-4, IL-6, IL-7, IL-10, IL-11, LIF, oncostatin M, M-CSF, G-CSF and GM-CSF, and TGFbeta1, TNF-alpha, IFN-alpha were examined. We show that GM-CSF and IL-6, in combination with the phorbol ester 12-O-tetradecanoyl-phorbol acetate (TPA), restored differentiation and cell cycle arrest. In contrast, treatment by TGFbeta1 +/- TPA resulted in an efficient G1/G0 arrest, but did not appear to induce terminal differentiation. Restoration of differentiation and cell cycle arrest was accomplished despite maintained expression of the v-Myc protein. Our results show that the cytokine-induced signals reduced Myc-dependent transcription of an artificial target promoter/reporter gene construct, correlating in most, but not all, cases with decreased association of v- and c-Myc with its essential partner, Max. Thus, cytokine-induced signals may counteract the activity of deregulated Myc, and contribute to the normalization of differentiation, arrest in the G1/G0 phase of the cell cycle, or both.","['Oberg, F', 'Wu, S', 'Bahram, F', 'Nilsson, K', 'Larsson, L G']","['Oberg F', 'Wu S', 'Bahram F', 'Nilsson K', 'Larsson LG']","['Department of Genetics and Pathology, University of Uppsala, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Cytokines)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Cell Cycle/*physiology', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects/*physiology', 'Cytokines/*physiology', '*Genes, myc', 'Humans', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'U937 Cells']",,2001/03/10 10:00,2001/04/03 10:01,['2001/03/10 10:00'],"['2001/03/10 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/04/03 10:01 [medline]', '2001/03/10 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2001 Feb;15(2):217-27. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2402025.,,,['10.1038/sj.leu.2402025 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We conducted the current study to determine an appropriate method of granulocyte mobilization in healthy donors, and to evaluate the safety and efficacy of granulocyte transfusion therapy in patients with neutropenia-related infections. To mobilize granulocytes (n=55), healthy normal donors were stimulated in one of the following ways: (1) dexamethasone, 3 mg/m2 intravenously 15 min prior to leukapheresis (n = 5); (2) granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), 5 microg/kg subcutaneously 12 to 14 h prior to collection (n=37); or (3) G-CSF and dexamethasone (n= 13). The mean granulocyte yield from stimulation with G-CSF plus dexamethasone was significantly higher than from stimulation with dexamethasone or G-CSF alone. Twenty-five patients with severe neutropenia-related infections unresponsive to appropriate antimicrobial agents received a total of 55 granulocyte transfusions. The patients from whom fungi or Gram-negative organisms were isolated showed a more favorable response than those infected with Gram-positive organisms. However, the responses to the granulocyte transfusion therapy could not be correlated with the transfused dose, mobilization agents, or the 1 h or 24 h post-transfusion absolute neutrophil counts.

Histological leukostasis was the most evident feature in all cases, particularly at the lung level, where tumor-like aspects were evident and widely diffused in case II. The last three cases were pregnant at the third trimester. Serious hemorrhagic complications were evident in all cases: CID in the former 3 cases and primary hyperfibrinolysis in the 4th, as demonstrated by the absence of intravascular cloths in many organs and especially in lung and kidney; abundant, on the contrary, in the former three cases. Leukostasis was not associated to hyper-leucocytosis in all 4 cases, but associated to normal number of peripheral white cells (below normal level in case III). This phenomenon, that disagrees with literature data on acute or chronic reactivated myeloid leukemia leukostasis, may be due to the primary confination of the immature granuloblasts in the vascular bed, because of the hemoreologic effects connected with their deficient plasticity, that is essential for normal granulocytes to flow easily in the capillary bed. In all cases death was caused by breathing and cardiocirculatory insufficiency with the associated unceasing hemorrhages.","['Aragona, M', 'Aragona, F']","['Aragona M', 'Aragona F']","['Istituto di Clinica Oncologica e di Ricerca sui Tumori, Policlinico Universitario, Padiglione H, Universita degli Studi, Messina. aragona@sirio-oncology.it']",['ita'],"['Case Reports', 'English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Italy,Minerva Med,Minerva medica,0400732,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Cytoplasmic Granules/pathology', '*Death, Sudden', 'Fatal Outcome', 'Female', 'Fibrinolysis/physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*blood/diagnosis', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Acute/*blood/diagnosis', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*blood/diagnosis', 'Leukostasis/*blood/diagnosis', 'Lung/pathology', 'Respiratory Insufficiency']",,2001/03/10 10:00,2001/04/17 10:01,['2001/03/10 10:00'],"['2001/03/10 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/04/17 10:01 [medline]', '2001/03/10 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Minerva Med. 2000 Oct;91(10):229-37.,Morte inattesa da leucostasi e da tumori leucostatici polmonari nelle leucemie mieloidi acute.

The purpose of this investigation was to evaluate features of CD61+ megakaryopoiesis related to successful engraftment. Further, we tried to elucidate possible associations of this lineage, including precursor cells, with the platelet count and reticulin fibrosis during the pretransplant and, specifically, post-transplant periods. A significant correlation was recognizable between the quantity of CD61+ megakaryocytes and the platelet values before BMT and also after completed hematopoietic recovery. In the very early post-transplant period, which is associated with severe thrombocytopenia, patchy regeneration of disarranged hematopoiesis occurred, including dysplastic megakaryocytes. According to planimetric measurements after BMT, the atypical micromegakaryocytes characteristic for chronic myeloid leukemia disappeared, and the engrafted donor bone marrow revealed a prevalence of normal-size cells of this lineage. On the other hand, normalization of megakaryocyte size was absent in sequential examinations of the few patients with a leukemic relapse who had a predominance of atypical dwarf forms comparable with chronic myeloid leukemia. Before BMT occurred, reticulin fiber density was significantly correlated with the number of CD61+ megakaryocytes and its precursor cell population. In 34 patients with myelofibrosis that occurred after myelo-ablative therapy and BMT, an initial regression was followed by an insidious recurrence of fibers concentrated in the areas of regenerating hematopoiesis. This postgraft reappearance of reticulin fibrosis was significantly associated with the quantity of megakaryocytes. Regarding engraftment parameters, pretransplant presence of (reticulin) myelofibrosis exerted a distinctive impact because of a delayed hematopoietic reconstitution according to standard clinical criteria. In line with this finding, slowed engraftment was also significantly related with higher pretransplant megakaryocyte and platelet counts.","['Thiele, J', 'Kvasnicka, H M', 'Beelen, D W', 'Flucke, U', 'Spoer, C', 'Paperno, S', 'Leder, L D', 'Schaefer, U W']","['Thiele J', 'Kvasnicka HM', 'Beelen DW', 'Flucke U', 'Spoer C', 'Paperno S', 'Leder LD', 'Schaefer UW']","['Institutes of Pathology, Universities of Cologne, Cologne, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Mod Pathol,"Modern pathology : an official journal of the United States and Canadian Academy of Pathology, Inc",8806605,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Integrin beta3)', '0 (Platelet Membrane Glycoproteins)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Antigens, CD/analysis', 'Bone Marrow/chemistry/*pathology/physiology', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Cell Count', 'Female', '*Hematopoiesis', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Integrin beta3', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*pathology/therapy', 'Male', 'Megakaryocytes/chemistry/*pathology', 'Platelet Membrane Glycoproteins/analysis', 'Primary Myelofibrosis/etiology/*pathology/physiopathology', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",,2001/03/10 10:00,2001/05/18 10:01,['2001/03/10 10:00'],"['2001/03/10 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/05/18 10:01 [medline]', '2001/03/10 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Mod Pathol. 2001 Feb;14(2):129-38. doi: 10.1038/modpathol.3880269.,,,['10.1038/modpathol.3880269 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Between 1974 and 2000, 89 consecutive infants with a mean age of 6.3 +/- 2.6 months (range, 15 days to 12 months) underwent repair of tetralogy of Fallot (ventricular septal defect and pulmonary stenosis) by one surgeon (J.L.M.). Three infants had previous palliative operations. Sixty-seven procedures were urgent or emergency. A transannular patch was inserted in 69 patients (77.5%). Follow-up was complete, averaging 13.4 +/- 5.6 years (range, 0 to 25.4 years). RESULTS: There was one operative death (1.1%). Mean right ventricular to left ventricular pressure ratio postoperatively was 0.4 +/- 1.1 (in 79 patients, < 0.5). Fourteen patients underwent reoperations or reinterventions. There were no reoperations for residual or recurrent ventricular septal defect. Kaplan-Meier freedom from reoperation or reintervention for any cause at 20 years was 85% +/- 4.4%, for relief of right ventricular outflow tract obstruction it was 94% +/- 3.1%, and for pulmonary valve replacement this was 95.4% +/- 2.6%. Use of a transannular patch did not significantly affect the need for reoperation or reintervention. There was one late death (leukemia). Kaplan-Meier 20-year survival was 97.8% +/- 1.9%. On latest echocardiography, 42 patients had moderate pulmonary regurgitation, 4 had a right ventricular outflow tract gradient more than 40 mm Hg, and 86 had good biventricular function. Twelve-lead electrocardiography was performed in all and 24-hour electrocardiography in 61 patients. One patient (1.1%) exhibited late recurrent ventricular tachycardia requiring implantation of a defibrillator. The remaining 86 patients are in New York Heart Association class I with none of them receiving antiarrhythmic medications. CONCLUSIONS: These data strongly support the concept of early repair of tetralogy of Fallot. It is associated with an acceptable operative risk and a low incidence of significant arrhythmias, and provides long-term survival similar to that observed in the general population. Late complications may, however, develop, and long-term follow-up for their early recognition is essential.","['Alexiou, C', 'Mahmoud, H', 'Al-Khaddour, A', 'Gnanapragasam, J', 'Salmon, A P', 'Keeton, B R', 'Monro, J L']","['Alexiou C', 'Mahmoud H', 'Al-Khaddour A', 'Gnanapragasam J', 'Salmon AP', 'Keeton BR', 'Monro JL']","['Department of Cardiac Surgery, The General Hospital, Southampton, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Netherlands,Ann Thorac Surg,The Annals of thoracic surgery,15030100R,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Male', 'Postoperative Complications/*etiology/surgery', 'Reoperation', 'Tetralogy of Fallot/*surgery', 'Treatment Outcome']",,2001/03/10 10:00,2001/04/03 10:01,['2001/03/10 10:00'],"['2001/03/10 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/04/03 10:01 [medline]', '2001/03/10 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Ann Thorac Surg. 2001 Feb;71(2):494-500. doi: 10.1016/s0003-4975(00)02444-9.,,,"['S0003-4975(00)02444-9 [pii]', '10.1016/s0003-4975(00)02444-9 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Plastic-embedded section of bone marrow biopsy was stained with H-Giemsa-E. Immunotyping of NHL was performed immunohistochemically. RESULTS: A total of 70 patients with NHLBMI(male: 52, female: 18; median age: 49 years) was studied. There were 20 patients with T cell-lymphoma and 50 patients with B cell-lymphoma. The extent of bone marrow involvement was minimal in 15 cases, moderate in 16 cases and severe in 39 cases. Bone marrow involvement was of interstitial type in 23 cases, nodular type in 7 cases, and mixed type in 18 cases and diffuse type in 22 cases. The frequency of splenomegaly in nodular type NHLBMI was significantly higher than that in any other type. Nodular type NHLBMI occurred mainly in B cell-lymphoma. Lymphoma cell leukemia (LCL) developed in 14 of 39 (35.9%) cases of NHL with severe bone marrow involvement which was significantly more frequent than that in NHL with mild and moderate bone marrow involvement. CONCLUSION: Difference in the extent and pattern of bone marrow involvement in NHL is related to clinical manifestations.

METHODS: The expression of adhesion molecules (LFA-1, Mac-1, L-selectin) on bone marrow CD34+ cells from 34 CML patients were analyzed by three-color flow cytometry. RESULTS: The mean percentage of expression of L-selectin, and LFA-1 on CD34+ CD38-(-)+ cells from untreated CML patients was significantly lower than that from normal controls. Among 8 CML patients treated with IFN-alpha, the expression of L-selectin and LFA-1 on CD34+ CD38- cell (37.6 +/- 5.3%, 42.1 +/- 13.1%) was comparable to that from normal controls (38.2 +/- 9.4%, 48.2 +/- 12.2%).

To investigate the pathogenetic role of HTLV-I in these clinical disorders, we established a transgenic rat model carrying the env-pX gene of HTLV-I(env-pX rat), which develops arthritis, myocarditis, dermatitis, necrotizing arteritis, myositis and sialoadenitis. Several autoantibodies, such as anti-nuclear and anti-cardiolipin antibodies and rheumatoid factor, were detected in the sera. Peripheral T lymphocytes of env-pX rats expressed co-stimulatory molecules and showed hyper-immune reactivity to various stimulation in vitro. In this study, to characterize major pathogenic autoantigens in the affected lesions, the author examined the clonalities of T cells in the spleen and of infiltrating T cells in the skin lesions as well as affected joints of env-pX rats by single strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) of polymerase chain reaction-amplified cDNA fragments of T cell receptor (TCR) V beta. No specific expansion of particular T cell clones was evident in the spleen of env-pX rats. Oligoclonal T cell expansions were observed in both infiltrating T cells of the affected joints and skin lesions, but no specific T cell clones common in the two lesions expanded in env-pX rats. Also, no specific amino acid motif in the complementarity determining region 3 of TCR V beta was evident in the affected joints. Those results suggest that the locally expanded T cell clones against various autoantigens of the joint or skin induced by the transgene may play major pathogenetic roles in development of autoimmune diseases in env-pX rats. On the other hand, env-pX rats easily developed arthritis by immunization of type II collagen and the SSCP patterns of accumulated T cell clonotypes in the arthritis were similar to those of arthritis developed in env-pX rats without immunization. The evidence suggests that the type II collagen-immunization may be a trigger to develop the inherent arthritis of env-pX rats.","['Sugaya, T']",['Sugaya T'],"['Department of Pathology/Pathophysiology, Division of Pathophysiological Science, Hokkaido University Graduate School of Medicine, Sapporo 060-8648, Japan.']",['jpn'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Japan,Hokkaido Igaku Zasshi,[Hokkaido igaku zasshi] The Hokkaido journal of medical science,17410290R,"['0 (Autoantibodies)', '0 (Gene Products, env)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)', '9007-34-5 (Collagen)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Animals, Genetically Modified', 'Arthritis/*immunology', 'Autoantibodies/blood', 'Autoimmune Diseases/genetics/*immunology', 'Clone Cells', 'Collagen/immunology', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Gene Products, env/*genetics', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*genetics', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Rats', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/genetics', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology']",,2001/03/10 10:00,2001/05/22 10:01,['2001/03/10 10:00'],"['2001/03/10 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/05/22 10:01 [medline]', '2001/03/10 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Hokkaido Igaku Zasshi. 2001 Jan;76(1):35-47.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In non-M3 acute myeloid leukemia (AML), the effects are less clear, and there is a pronounced heterogeneity in the sensitivity to the growth-inhibitory effects of retinoids in leukemic cells from different non-M3 AML patients. Retinoids exert their effects through a number of nuclear receptors [retinoic acid receptors (RARs) and retinoid X receptors (RXRs)]. In this study, we determined the expression of RAR alpha, RAR beta, RAR gamma, and RXR alpha by real-time PCR in four cell lines and in blast cells from patients with non-M3 AML before and after ATRA incubation. All four receptors were expressed in cells from all 18 tested patient samples and in four myeloid cell lines. In the majority of the patient samples as well as in the cell lines, there was a pattern of high expression of RAR alpha and RXR alpha and low expression of RAR beta and RAR gamma. There was no correlation between the basal expression of any of the retinoid receptors and sensitivity to ATRA. A 24-h exposure to ATRA increased the expression of RAR alpha, RAR beta, RAR gamma, and RXR alpha in 46%, 77%, 30%, and 38% of the samples, respectively. The mean increase in receptor expression was most pronounced for RAR beta and RXR alpha. There was a significant correlation between an increase in RAR beta expression in response to ATRA and sensitivity to ATRA (P < 0.014). No such correlations were found for RAR alpha, RAR gamma, and RXR alpha. The expression of the monocytoid marker CD14 was significantly correlated with increased expression of RAR alpha (P = 0.03). We conclude that RAR alpha, RAR beta, RAR gamma, and RXR alpha are expressed in non-M3 AML blast cells and that ATRA-induced expression of RAR beta may be a marker for retinoid sensitivity.","['Lehmann, S', 'Paul, C', 'Torma, H']","['Lehmann S', 'Paul C', 'Torma H']","['Department of Hematology, Karolinska Institute, Huddinge Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden.

Cotreatment with STI-571 partially overcomes the resistance to antileukemic drug-induced apoptosis of HL-60/Bcr-Abl and K562 cells. Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) alpha-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (Apo-2L/TRAIL), after binding with its signaling death receptors (DR4 and DR5), triggers the intrinsic ""mitochondrial"" pathway of apoptosis more efficiently in the cancer than do normal cells. In the present studies, we compared the apoptotic effects of Apo-2L/TRAIL, with or without cotreatment with STI-571, in HL-60/neo, HL-60/Bcr-Abl, and K562 cells. As compared with HL-60/neo, HL-60/Bcr-Abl and K562 cells are relatively resistant to Apo-2L/TRAIL-induced apoptosis. In HL-60/Bcr-Abl and K562 versus HL-60/neo cells, Apo-2L/TRAIL caused less cytosolic accumulation of cytochrome c and the processing of caspase-9 and -3. This was also associated with decreased processing of caspase-8, c-FLIP(L) and Bid. Reduced effects of Apo-2L/TRAIL in Bcr-Abl-positive leukemic cells were not attributable to diminished expression of DR4 and DR5, or higher expressions of the decoy receptors DcR1 and -2 or c-FLIP(L). Cotreatment with STI-571 significantly enhanced Apo-2L/TRAIL-induced apoptosis (P < 0.01) as well as increased the processing of caspase-9 and -3 and XIAP, without affecting the levels of DR4, DR5, decoy receptors, or c-FLIP(L). Cotreatment with STI-571 did not enhance Apo-2L/TRAIL-induced apoptosis of HL-60/neo cells. These studies suggest that a combined treatment with STI-571 may be an effective strategy to selectively sensitize Bcr-Abl-positive leukemic blasts to Apo-2L/TRAIL-induced apoptosis.","['Nimmanapalli, R', 'Porosnicu, M', 'Nguyen, D', 'Worthington, E', ""O'Bryan, E"", 'Perkins, C', 'Bhalla, K']","['Nimmanapalli R', 'Porosnicu M', 'Nguyen D', 'Worthington E', ""O'Bryan E"", 'Perkins C', 'Bhalla K']","['Interdisciplinary Oncology Program, Moffitt Cancer Center, University of South Florida, Tampa 33612, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,"['0 (Annexin A5)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Cytochrome c Group)', '0 (Drug Combinations)', '0 (Ligands)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand)', '0 (TNFSF10 protein, human)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)']",IM,"['Annexin A5/metabolism', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins', 'Benzamides', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cytochrome c Group/metabolism', 'Drug Combinations', 'Drug Synergism', 'Genes, abl/genetics', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy/genetics/metabolism', 'Ligands', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/*pharmacology', 'Piperazines/*pharmacology', 'Pyrimidines/*pharmacology', 'TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects/metabolism', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/*metabolism/*pharmacology']",,2001/03/10 10:00,2001/06/19 10:01,['2001/03/10 10:00'],"['2001/03/10 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/06/19 10:01 [medline]', '2001/03/10 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2001 Feb;7(2):350-7.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,['Clin Cancer Res. 2019 Jul 1;25(13):4195.

Simultaneous or subsequent exposure of F-ara-A-treated cells (2 microM) to UCN-01 (100 nM) resulted in a marked potentiation of apoptosis, manifested by loss of mitochondrial membrane potential (delta psi(m)), cleavage/activation of procaspase-9 and procaspase-3, DNA fragmentation, and degradation of poly-ADP(ribosyl) polymerase. Coadministration of UCN-01 with F-ara-A was also associated with diminished phosphorylation of the cdc25 phosphatase. In contrast, exposure of cells to the sequence UCN-01, followed by F-ara-A, resulted in only a modest increase in apoptotic cells. The ability of UCN-01 to potentiate F-ara-A-mediated lethality was not mimicked by the selective PKC inhibitor bisindolylmaleimide, nor did treatment of cells with UCN-01 enhance formation of F-ara-ATP or increase incorporation of [3H]F-ara-A into DNA. Enhanced apoptosis in cells exposed sequentially or simultaneously to F-ara-A and UCN-01 was accompanied by a substantial reduction in colony formation (e.g., to 0.01% of control values). Cotreatment with UCN-01 also increased F-ara-A-mediated apoptosis and loss of delta psi(m) in U937 cells ectopically expressing Bcl-2, although not to the same extent as that observed in empty-vector controls. Finally, simultaneous exposure (24 h) of malignant B lymphocytes from the pleural effusion of a patient with indolent non-Hodgkin's lymphoma to F-ara-A and UCN-01 ex vivo resulted in a striking increase in apoptosis, as determined by terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated nick end labeling assay. These findings indicate that UCN-01 increases F-ara-A-induced mitochondrial damage and apoptosis in human leukemia cells in a sequence-dependent manner, and that these events occur in at least some primary human lymphoma cells.","['Harvey, S', 'Decker, R', 'Dai, Y', 'Schaefer, G', 'Tang, L', 'Kramer, L', 'Dent, P', 'Grant, S']","['Harvey S', 'Decker R', 'Dai Y', 'Schaefer G', 'Tang L', 'Kramer L', 'Dent P', 'Grant S']","['Department of Medicine, Medical College of Virginia, Virginia Commonwealth University, Richmond 23298, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,"['0 (Alkaloids)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Arabinonucleotides)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '74832-57-8 (2-fluoro-araATP)', '7BU5H4V94A (7-hydroxystaurosporine)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'H88EPA0A3N (Staurosporine)', 'P2K93U8740 (fludarabine)']",IM,"['Alkaloids/*metabolism', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*metabolism', 'Apoptosis', 'Arabinonucleotides/biosynthesis', 'Blotting, Western', 'Drug Interactions', 'Drug Synergism', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*metabolism', 'HL-60 Cells/cytology/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*metabolism/pathology', 'Lymphoma/*metabolism/pathology', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Kinase C/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'Staurosporine/analogs & derivatives', 'U937 Cells/drug effects', 'Vidarabine/*analogs & derivatives/*metabolism']",,2001/03/10 10:00,2001/06/19 10:01,['2001/03/10 10:00'],"['2001/03/10 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/06/19 10:01 [medline]', '2001/03/10 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2001 Feb;7(2):320-30.,,,,,"['CA 63753/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 77141/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,

We studied the influence of IFN-alpha treatment on the frequency of malignant hematopoietic precursor cells in the peripheral blood (PB) of CML patients during the course of the disease. PB 10-day colony-forming cells (PB-CFCs) were assessed with regard to their quantity, lineage distribution, and BCR-ABL status, as determined by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). PB-CFC numbers were determined in 39 patients (29 in the chronic phase, 6 in an advanced stage, and 4 with progression to an advanced stage during follow-up). Thirty-one patients were evaluated either once or several times to determine the BCR-ABL status of the colonies. BCR-ABL negative PB-CFCs were detectable at diagnosis in 5 of 11 patients. A major reduction of BCR-ABL positive colonies to <25% of PB-CFCs was observed in 10/13 determinable IFN-alpha treated patients in early and late chronic phases, indicating a high proportion of BCR-ABL negativity at the clonogenic cell level. In contrast, only 3 of these patients had a cytogenetic response of <25% Philadelphia chromosome (Ph1)-positive metaphases in bone marrow cytogenetics. Treatment with IFN-alpha and/or hydroxyurea (HU) during chronic phase was accompanied by a reduction of PB-CFCs to subnormal levels (median 24 CFCs/ml) compared to controls (median 207 CFCs/ml), untreated patients in chronic phase (median 25,979 CFCs/ml), and patients with advanced disease (median 6,047 CFCs/ml).

After a period of stability, with no need for transfusions, the MDS progressed into acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in August 1998 with the emergence of a cytogenetic abnormality (11q-). Two courses of chemotherapy were given, resulting in prolonged pancytopenia; however, no clearance of bone marrow (BM) blasts was achieved. At that time, severe infections and daily epistaxis occurred. Frequent transfusions of packed red blood cells (RBC) and platelets (2-3/week) were necessary. After 2 months of persisting severe pancytopenia, we started a therapy with amifostine: 4 x 250 mg intravenously (i.v.) weekly for 1 month, followed by a maintenance therapy with 500 mg once weekly. After 2 weeks of amifostine therapy, hematopoiesis began to improve. In the subsequent 2 months, the patient became completely independent of the platelet transfusions; the transfusion frequency of RBC was permanently reduced (2 RBC transfusions/month) and a significant decrease of BM blasts was achieved. After 30 weeks of amifostine therapy, the morphology of the MDS switched to a chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML)-like appearance, with continuously increasing leukocytes, so that we discontinued amifostine therapy for 1 month to exclude a possible side effect of amifostine. At that time, leukocytes further increased to 74,000/microl; thus, we decided to perform a cytoreductive chemotherapy (hydroxycarbamide) and continued weekly amifostine infusions. During 1 year of amifostine therapy, the patient had a good quality of life, with no need for hospitalization and a complete cytogenetic remission. We conclude that, in this case, amifostine had two effects: a significant improvement of impaired hematopoiesis and a slowing down of disease progression. Thus, amifostine might be a therapeutic option in older patients with advanced MDS.","['Yilmaz, A', 'Kaufmann, C C', 'Binder, C', 'Wormann, B', 'Haase, D']","['Yilmaz A', 'Kaufmann CC', 'Binder C', 'Wormann B', 'Haase D']","['Department of Hematology/Oncology, Georg-August University, Gottingen, Germany.

There are two major Prx subfamilies: one subfamily uses two conserved cysteines (2-Cys) and the other uses 1-Cys to scavenge reactive oxygen species (ROS). This review focuses on the four mammalian 2-Cys members (Prx I-IV) that utilize thioredoxin as the electron donor for antioxidation. The array of biological activities of these proteins suggests that they may be evolutionarily important for cell function. For example, Prxs are capable of protecting cells from ROS insult and regulating the signal transduction pathways that utilize c-Abl, caspases, nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) and activator protein-1 (AP-1) to influence cell growth and apoptosis. Prxs are also essential for red blood cell (RBC) differentiation and are capable of inhibiting human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection and organ transplant rejection. Distribution patterns indicate that Prxs are highly expressed in the tissues and cells at risk for diseases related to ROS toxicity, such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases and atherosclerosis. This interesting correlation suggests that Prxs are protective against ROS toxicity, yet overwhelmed by oxidative stress in some cells. Prxs tend to form large aggregates at high concentrations, a feature that may interfere with their normal protective function or may even render them cytotoxic. Imbalance in the expression of subtypes can also potentially increase their susceptibility to oxidative stress. Understanding the function and biological role of Prxs may lead to important discoveries about the cellular dysfunction of ROS-related diseases ranging from atherosclerosis to cancer to neurodegenerative diseases.","['Butterfield, L H', 'Merino, A', 'Golub, S H', 'Shau, H']","['Butterfield LH', 'Merino A', 'Golub SH', 'Shau H']","['Division of Surgical Oncology, UCLA School of Medicine, Los Angeles, CA 90095-1782, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",United States,Antioxid Redox Signal,Antioxidants & redox signaling,100888899,"['0 (Antioxidants)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', 'EC 1.11.1.- (Peroxidases)', 'EC 1.11.1.15 (Peroxiredoxins)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Antioxidants/*metabolism', 'Apoptosis/physiology', '*Cytoprotection', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/physiopathology', 'Models, Biological', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Organ Transplantation', 'Oxidation-Reduction', 'Peroxidases/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Peroxiredoxins', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/*metabolism', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Signal Transduction']",142,2001/03/10 10:00,2001/04/06 10:01,['2001/03/10 10:00'],"['2001/03/10 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/04/06 10:01 [medline]', '2001/03/10 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Antioxid Redox Signal. 1999 Winter;1(4):385-402. doi: 10.1089/ars.1999.1.4-385.,,,['10.1089/ars.1999.1.4-385 [doi]'],,"['R01 CA 77623/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA 79976/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,

To date, no specific combination has emerged as more efficacious than any other. To reduce toxicity and shorten the duration of neutropenia, hematopoietic growth factors are often added to the chemotherapy regimen, especially in elderly patients. In all prospective, randomized, growth factor trials to date, daunorubicin has been the drug selected for combination with cytarabine. We hypothesized that mitoxantrone might be as efficacious in this patient population with perhaps less toxicity when combined with granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF). Patients older than age 55 years with a diagnosis of either de novo or secondary, untreated acute myelogenous leukemia were eligible for this clinical trial. Eligible patients were treated with cytarabine 100 mg/m2 infused as a continuous infusion daily for 7 days and mitoxantrone 12 mg/m2 bolus intravenously for the first 3 days of cytarabine. A second cycle of chemotherapy was administered on the fourteenth day of treatment if marrow aplasia was not achieved with the first cycle. Once aplasia was achieved, GM-CSF 250 microg/m2 was given subcutaneously daily until neutrophil recovery. Those patients who achieved complete remission were treated with two cycles of intermediate-dose cytarabine (400 mg/m2 daily for 5 days) and with GM-CSF as consolidation therapy. Of the 30 patients treated, the median age was 69 years (range: 55-76 years) and 18 patients were older than 65 years of age. Seven (23%) patients had secondary acute leukemia and 12 (40%) had poor-risk cytogenetics. Nineteen (63%) achieved a complete remission. Eleven patients were either refractory to treatment or died during their treatment. The toxicity encountered was no more than that reported in similar studies using daunorubicin in combination with cytarabine. Long-term survival was poor, with a median disease-free survival of only 8.1 months in patients who achieved complete remission. In this elderly population of patients with high-risk acute myelogenous leukemia, this combination of cytarabine, mitoxantrone, and GM-CSF resulted in an adequate remission rate with acceptable toxicity. Long-term survival, however, was poor and innovative treatment approaches to maintain remission are needed.","['Kalaycio, M', 'Pohlman, B', 'Elson, P', 'Lichtin, A', 'Hussein, M', 'Tripp, B', 'Andresen, S']","['Kalaycio M', 'Pohlman B', 'Elson P', 'Lichtin A', 'Hussein M', 'Tripp B', 'Andresen S']","['Department of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Cleveland Clinic Foundation, Ohio 44195, USA. kalaycm@ccf.org']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Am J Clin Oncol,American journal of clinical oncology,8207754,"['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', 'BZ114NVM5P (Mitoxantrone)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage', 'Female', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/administration & dosage', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mitoxantrone/administration & dosage', 'Neutrophils/drug effects']",,2001/03/10 10:00,2001/03/10 10:01,['2001/03/10 10:00'],"['2001/03/10 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/10 10:01 [medline]', '2001/03/10 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Am J Clin Oncol. 2001 Feb;24(1):58-63. doi: 10.1097/00000421-200102000-00010.,,,['10.1097/00000421-200102000-00010 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, therapeutic levels are associated with numerous untoward effects such as central nervous system damage in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia. The purpose of this study was to determine if MTX caused injury to endothelial cells using cultured bovine pulmonary artery endothelial cells as a model. Light microscopy showed gaps between cells and reduced numbers of endothelial cells after exposure to MTX (10(-9) to 10(-5) M), a range consistent with therapeutic drug levels. Proliferation and viability of subconfluent and confluent MTX-treated endothelial cells were measured by colorimetric (MTS) assay. There was a significant decline in cell numbers in MTX-treated subconfluent (growing) cells cultured after 4 days of MTX exposure compared to controls, as expected. However, there was also an unexpected decline in cell numbers in MTX-treated postmitotic endothelial cells after 1, 3, and 4 days of drug exposure. This suggested that MTX induced endothelial cell death. Fluorescent ApoAlert Enhanced Annexin-V binding demonstrated apoptosis in endothelial cells after 1 day of MTX exposure. Apoptosis was confirmed by a DNA fragment assay. This is apparently the first report of MTX-induced apoptosis of postmitotic, cultured endothelial cells. The findings suggest that apoptosis may be one mechanism of MTX-induced injury to endothelial cells.","['Merkle, C J', 'Moore, I M', 'Penton, B S', 'Torres, B J', 'Cueny, R K', 'Schaeffer, R C Jr', 'Montgomery, D W']","['Merkle CJ', 'Moore IM', 'Penton BS', 'Torres BJ', 'Cueny RK', 'Schaeffer RC Jr', 'Montgomery DW']","['College of Nursing, Department of Physiology, University of Arizona, Tucson, AZ 85721, USA. cmerkle@nursing.arizona.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Biol Res Nurs,Biological research for nursing,9815758,"['0 (Annexin A5)', '0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Nucleic Acid Synthesis Inhibitors)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Annexin A5/drug effects', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/administration & dosage/*adverse effects', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Cattle', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Drug Evaluation, Preclinical', 'Endothelium, Vascular/*drug effects/*growth & development', 'Methotrexate/administration & dosage/*adverse effects', 'Microscopy, Phase-Contrast', 'Mitosis/*drug effects', 'Nucleic Acid Synthesis Inhibitors/administration & dosage/*adverse effects', 'Pulmonary Artery/cytology', 'Time Factors']",,2001/03/10 10:00,2001/03/27 10:01,['2001/03/10 10:00'],"['2001/03/10 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/27 10:01 [medline]', '2001/03/10 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Biol Res Nurs. 2000 Jul;2(1):5-14. doi: 10.1177/109980040000200102.,,,['10.1177/109980040000200102 [doi]'],,['NR04343/NR/NINR NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,

As shown by zymography, HL-60 cells released three major isofroms of the matrix-degrading proteases; when the leukemic cells were grown in serum-free conditions, as well as after hyperthermia and methotrexate treatment, we found a significant loss of the constitutive production of the 92 kDa matrixmetalloprotease, with an unequivocable molecular and ultrastructural evidence of programmed cell death.

SET is fused to a putative oncoprotein, CAN/NUP214, in AUL and is thought to play a key role in leukemogenesis by its nuclear localization, protein-protein interactions and PP2A inhibitory activity. Here, we describe the isolation and characterization of a novel cDNA encoding a protein with 1542 amino-acid residues that specifically interacts in a yeast two-hybrid system as well as in human cells with SET. This new protein, which we name SEB (SET-binding protein), is identified as a 170-kDa protein by immunoprecipitation with a specific antibody and is localized predominantly in the nucleus. SEB1238--1434 is determined as a SET-binding region that specifically binds to SET182--223. SEB also has an oncoprotein Ski homologous region (amino acids 654--858), six PEST sequences and three sequential PPLPPPPP repeats at the C-terminus. SEB mRNA is expressed ubiquitously in all human adult tissues and cells examined. The SEB gene locus is assigned to the chromosome 18q21.1 that contains candidate tumor suppressor genes associated with deletions in cancer and leukemia. Although the function of SEB is not known, we propose that SEB plays a key role in the mechanism of SET-related leukemogenesis and tumorigenesis, perhaps by suppressing SET function or by regulating the transforming activity of Ski in the nucleus.","['Minakuchi, M', 'Kakazu, N', 'Gorrin-Rivas, M J', 'Abe, T', 'Copeland, T D', 'Ueda, K', 'Adachi, Y']","['Minakuchi M', 'Kakazu N', 'Gorrin-Rivas MJ', 'Abe T', 'Copeland TD', 'Ueda K', 'Adachi Y']","['Laboratory of Molecular Clinical Chemistry, Institute for Chemical Research, Kyoto University, Uji, Kyoto, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Eur J Biochem,European journal of biochemistry,0107600,"['0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Chromosomal Proteins, Non-Histone)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Histone Chaperones)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (SET protein, human)', '0 (SETBP1 protein, human)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '126648-96-2 (SKI protein, human)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Binding Sites', 'Carrier Proteins/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Chromosomal Proteins, Non-Histone', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 18/genetics', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/chemistry', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique, Indirect', 'Genes, Tumor Suppressor/genetics', 'HeLa Cells', 'Histone Chaperones', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutation/genetics', 'Nuclear Proteins/chemistry/genetics/metabolism', 'Physical Chromosome Mapping', 'Precipitin Tests', 'Protein Binding', 'Proteins/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/chemistry', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis/genetics', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid', 'Transcription Factors', 'Two-Hybrid System Techniques']",,2001/03/07 10:00,2001/05/22 10:01,['2001/03/07 10:00'],"['2001/03/07 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/05/22 10:01 [medline]', '2001/03/07 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Eur J Biochem. 2001 Mar;268(5):1340-51. doi: 10.1046/j.1432-1327.2001.02000.x.,,,"['ejb2000 [pii]', '10.1046/j.1432-1327.2001.02000.x [doi]']",,,,,,"['GENBANK/AB015614', 'GENBANK/AB022660']",,,,,,,,

A simultaneous treatment of leukemia L1210 cells with the combination of BR and STP resulted in synergistic cytotoxicity that correlated with increased apoptotic activity in those cells. On the other hand, treatment of L1210 cells with combination of BR and cis-Pt resulted in antagonistic cytotoxic effect. Finally, to elucidate the synergistic effect of BR and STP in inducing apoptosis, the attention was directed to the activation of cell death processes through various cell cycle signals.

The compounds are butyroyloxyalkyl derivatives of carboxylic acids, which possess functionalities suitable for aqueous solubilization. The anticancer activity of the prodrugs in vitro was evaluated by examining their effect on the growth of human colon, breast and pancreatic carcinoma cell lines, and their solubility in aqueous media was determined. The most promising compounds, with respect to activity and solubility, were found to be the butyroyloxymethyl esters of glutaric 2a and nicotinic acids 4a and phosphoric acid as its diethyl ester 10a, which displayed IC(50) values of 100 microM or lower. These prodrugs are expected to release formaldehyde upon metabolic hydrolysis. The corresponding butyroyloxyethyl esters (2b, 4b and 10b) that release acetaldehyde upon metabolism were significantly less potent. A similar correlation was observed for growth inhibition of the human prostate carcinoma cell lines PC-3 and LnCap and for induction of differentiation and apoptosis in the human myeloid leukemia cell line HL-60. The higher biological activity of the formaldehyde-releasing prodrugs 2a and 10a was further confirmed when induction of hemoglobin (Hb) synthesis in the human erythroleukemic cell line K562 was measured. Moreover, a therapeutic index (IC(50)/ED(50)) of ca. 5 was observed. The acute i.p. toxicity LD(50) in mice for 2a, 2b, 10a and 10b was similar and in the range of 400-600 mg kg(-1).

But in selected patients who are not responsive or not suitable to drug treatment, SI may offer still an effective, low toxic and cost-effective palliative modality.

In CLL, symptoms of splenomegaly have been improved in 50-87% of all patients with overall doses between 4 and 10 Gy in mostly 1-Gy fractions. PLL seems to be more resistant to SI with a median response rate of 66%. Casuistic reports described also efficacy of SI in HCL patients using similar radiation schedules. Symptomatic relief is also provided by SI in myeloproliferative disorders using lower overall doses between 1 and 9 Gy with small single fractions of 0.25 Gy (median). Acute toxicity was low in lymphoid disorders, but higher in myeloproliferative disorders with severe cytopenia in 10-30% of all cases, indicating the need for a cautious fractionation schedule. Interestingly, even complete systemic remissions after SI in all types of lymphoproliferative disorders have been described.

A wide variety of regimens have been used, and no single one has emerged as the best. Experimental evidence suggests a diversity of radiosensitivities of leukaemia cells in culture, which may correlate with a significant variation of leukaemic cell radiosensitivities between patients. The purpose of this project was to compute leukaemic cell killing by different schedules and determine whether a ""best treatment"" could be devised for individual patients. METHODS: We have developed a mathematical model for leukaemic cell killing by alternative TBI schedules, applied to a patient population with diverse leukaemic radiosensitivities. We considered 13 schedules in clinical use, and 14 theoretical schedules calculated (by the linear-quadratic model) to be iso-effective for risk of radiation pneumonitis. When each schedule of treatment is applied to the patient population, a distribution of leukaemic cell kills (log cell kill values) can be obtained for that schedule. The leukaemic kill distribution was also computed for optimized individual scheduling, each individual being treated by the schedule that was most effective for that patient. Using available data on the clinically observed dose response relationship for acute myeloid leukaemia, the model was extended to provide leukaemia cure probabilities for each of the schedules and for the individualized strategy. RESULTS: The computer simulations show that each schedule, applied to the treatment of a radiobiologically diverse patient population, results in a broad distribution of leukaemic log kill values, with a mean of 3-5 for most schedules (i.e. 10(-3)-10(-5) surviving fraction of leukaemic cells), and a broad variation (1-10 log kill) amongst patients. The distributions generated by the various schedules were found to be overlapping, implying that many of the schedules would be difficult to distinguish reliably in clinical trials. Individualized optimum treatment is possible if radiobiological parameters are known for each patient and would improve the leukaemic log kill distribution by about 1 log on average, corresponding to an increase of leukaemia cure probability of several percent overall. For some individual patients, however, optimal scheduling could make a large difference to treatment outcome. CONCLUSIONS: The use of many different clinical treatment schedules may be continuing because outcomes are similar when these diverse schedules are applied to unselected patient populations. The measurement of individual leukaemic cell radiosensitivity would allow individualized scheduling, which could result in modest increases in overall curability, but substantial improvements in survival or duration of remission for individual patients.","['Wheldon, T E', 'Barrett, A']","['Wheldon TE', 'Barrett A']","['Department of Radiation Oncology, CRC Beatson Laboratories, Scotland, Glasgow G61 1BD, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Meta-Analysis']",Ireland,Radiother Oncol,Radiotherapy and oncology : journal of the European Society for Therapeutic Radiology and Oncology,8407192,,IM,"['Cell Death', 'Computer Simulation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*radiotherapy', 'Models, Biological', 'Models, Theoretical', 'Radiation Pneumonitis/prevention & control', 'Radiation Tolerance', 'Radiotherapy Dosage', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/radiation effects', '*Whole-Body Irradiation']",,2001/03/07 10:00,2001/05/18 10:01,['2001/03/07 10:00'],"['2001/03/07 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/05/18 10:01 [medline]', '2001/03/07 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Radiother Oncol. 2001 Mar;58(3):227-33. doi: 10.1016/s0167-8140(00)00255-3.,,,"['S0167814000002553 [pii]', '10.1016/s0167-8140(00)00255-3 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Maximum stimulation was seen at 100 microM, resulting in significantly increased rates of cell division and maximum cell density. N8-Acetylspermidine levels in L1210 cells were shown to increase significantly after the APAH treatment as would be expected for deacetylase inhibition. The effects of deacetylase inhibition were mimicked by addition of N8-acetylspermidine to the culture medium at concentrations greater than 1 mM as indicated by a subsequent increase in rate of cell growth and maximum cell density. The magnitudes of the increases in growth observed were not large, but this might be expected in cells that are already in a rapid growth phase.

These data suggest that stimulation of cell growth occurs as a consequence of N8-acetylspermidine accumulation and N8-acetylspermidine deacetylase inhibition.","['Wang, Z', 'Fries, D', 'Blankenship, J']","['Wang Z', 'Fries D', 'Blankenship J']","['Departments of Physiology and Pharmacology, School of Pharmacy, University of the Pacific, Stockton, CA 95211, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",England,Biochem Pharmacol,Biochemical pharmacology,0101032,"['0 (Diamines)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Polyamines)', '122269-09-4 (7-(N-(3-aminopropyl)amino)heptan-2-one)', '13431-24-8 (N(8)-acetylspermidine)', '14278-49-0 (N(1)-acetylspermidine)', '2FZ7Y3VOQX (Spermine)', 'EC 3.5.- (Amidohydrolases)', 'EC 3.5.1.48 (acetylspermidine deacetylase)', 'U87FK77H25 (Spermidine)', 'V10TVZ52E4 (Putrescine)']",IM,"['Amidohydrolases/antagonists & inhibitors/*physiology', 'Animals', 'Cell Division/drug effects/*physiology', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Diamines/*pharmacology', 'Drug Interactions', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia L1210', 'Mice', 'Polyamines/metabolism', 'Putrescine/pharmacology', 'Spermidine/*analogs & derivatives/*pharmacology', 'Spermine/pharmacology']",,2001/03/07 10:00,2001/04/17 10:01,['2001/03/07 10:00'],"['2001/03/07 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/04/17 10:01 [medline]', '2001/03/07 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Biochem Pharmacol. 1999 May 15;57(10):1095-103. doi: 10.1016/s0006-2952(99)00028-3.,,,"['S0006-2952(99)00028-3 [pii]', '10.1016/s0006-2952(99)00028-3 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

For early genotoxicity screening of new chemical entities in industrial toxicology, the Comet assay is more and more used for assessment of the DNA damaging potential of a test compound. In order to increase compound screening throughput, we have established an image analysis system for fully automated measurement of microscope slides processed in the Comet assay. For the comparative investigation various cell types, such as V79 Chinese hamster cells, mouse lymphoma cells and human leukocytes, were treated with several test compounds. Using tail moment as the quantitative parameter for comet formation, we show a very high correlation between our automatic image analysis system and a commercially available, interactive system (Comet Assay II of Perceptive Instruments). The possibility of analyzing 50 samples within 1 day and the high reproducibility of results make automated image processing a powerful tool for automatic analysis of slides processed in the Comet assay.","['Frieauff, W', 'Hartmann, A', 'Suter, W']","['Frieauff W', 'Hartmann A', 'Suter W']","['Novartis Pharma AG, Preclinical Safety, Toxicology/Pathology, CH-4002 Basel, Switzerland. wilfried.frieauff@pharma.novartis.com']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",England,Mutagenesis,Mutagenesis,8707812,"['0 (Anthracenes)', '0 (Mutagens)', '8240818JGU (2-anthramine)', '9H154DI0UP (Ethyl Methanesulfonate)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Anthracenes/pharmacology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Comet Assay/*instrumentation/*methods', 'Cricetinae', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Ethyl Methanesulfonate/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Image Processing, Computer-Assisted/instrumentation/methods', 'Leukemia L5178', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Microscopy/instrumentation/methods', 'Mutagens/pharmacology', 'Rats', 'Rats, Wistar']",,2001/03/07 10:00,2001/06/08 10:01,['2001/03/07 10:00'],"['2001/03/07 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/06/08 10:01 [medline]', '2001/03/07 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Mutagenesis. 2001 Mar;16(2):133-7. doi: 10.1093/mutage/16.2.133.,,,['10.1093/mutage/16.2.133 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 128 patients with CLL were treated with fludarabine 30 mg/m(2) intravenously daily for 3 days and cyclophosphamide at either 500 mg/m(2) daily for 3 days (n = 11), 350 mg/m(2)/d for 3 days (n = 26), or 300 mg/m(2) daily for 3 days (n = 91). The cyclophosphamide dose was decreased because of myelosuppression in the early part of the study. Patients were divided into four groups based on the expectation for response to single-agent fludarabine, including previously untreated patients, patients previously treated with alkylating agents, patients successfully treated with alkylating agents and fludarabine but relapsing, and patients refractory to fludarabine with or without alkylating agents. RESULTS: Fludarabine and cyclophosphamide produced > or = 80% response rates in all patients not refractory to fludarabine at the start of therapy as well as a 38% response rate in patients who were refractory to fludarabine. The complete remission (CR) rate was 35% in previously untreated patients, which was not significantly different from the CR rate in historical control patients treated with single-agent fludarabine. However, residual disease assessed by flow cytometry occurred in only 8% of previously untreated patients achieving CR, and median time to progression has not been reached after a median follow-up of 41 months. The main complication of therapy was related to myelosuppression and infection. Neutropenia to less than 500 x 10(9)/L was noted in 48% of patients who received cyclophosphamide 300 mg/m(2). Pneumonia or sepsis occurred in 25% of patients, and fever of unknown origin occurred in another 25%. Pneumonia or sepsis were significantly more frequent in patients who were refractory to fludarabine at the start of combination chemotherapy. CONCLUSION: Fludarabine and cyclophosphamide seem to have a significant advantage over single-agent fludarabine in the salvage setting. Although the CR rate was not increased in previously untreated patients, residual disease detected by flow cytometry was rare and remission durations seemed to be prolonged in this subset. Myelosuppression and infection remain the most significant complications of therapy in CLL.","[""O'Brien, S M"", 'Kantarjian, H M', 'Cortes, J', 'Beran, M', 'Koller, C A', 'Giles, F J', 'Lerner, S', 'Keating, M']","[""O'Brien SM"", 'Kantarjian HM', 'Cortes J', 'Beran M', 'Koller CA', 'Giles FJ', 'Lerner S', 'Keating M']","['Leukemia Department, The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030, USA.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,"['8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'P2K93U8740 (fludarabine)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Cyclophosphamide/administration & dosage', 'Disease Progression', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Infusions, Intravenous', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Salvage Therapy', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Vidarabine/administration & dosage/*analogs & derivatives']",,2001/03/07 10:00,2001/04/03 10:01,['2001/03/07 10:00'],"['2001/03/07 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/04/03 10:01 [medline]', '2001/03/07 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2001 Mar 1;19(5):1414-20. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2001.19.5.1414.,,,['10.1200/JCO.2001.19.5.1414 [doi]'],,"['CA32839/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA81534/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Fifty-two unselected patients with t-MDS and 25 patients with t-AML were studied by polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-single-strand conformational polymorphism (SSCP) at the DNA level and by reverse transcriptase (RT)-PCR-SSCP at the mRNA level, and cases with aberrant SSCP patterns were sequenced. RESULTS: Somatically acquired mutations of p53 were observed in 21 of 77 cases of t-MDS or t-AML, and 19 of these 21 patients had received alkylating agents. Single-base substitutions at A:T pairs were more common in t-MDS and t-AML, whereas single-base substitutions at G:C pairs are most common in MDS and AML de novo and in solid tumors. Six patients demonstrated a cytogenetic loss of 17p13, and these six and an additional nine patients with p53 mutations demonstrated LOH of p53 at the DNA or mRNA level. This suggests a cytogenetic loss of the normal p53 allele in these nine cases combined with duplication of the homologous chromosome 17 carrying the mutated p53 allele. Mutations of p53 were significantly associated with deletion or loss of 5q (P <.0001) and a complex karyotype (P =.0001), but surprisingly were not associated with deletion or loss of 7q (P =.73), and were infrequent in patients with balanced chromosome translocations (P =.03). Mutations of p53 were more common in older patients (P =.036) and were associated with an extremely poor prognosis (P =.014), apparently restricted to the 15 cases with LOH of p53 ( P =.046). CONCLUSION: Mutations with loss of function of p53 are significantly associated with deletion or loss of 5q in t-MDS and t-AML after previous treatment with alkylating agents and are associated with genetic instability.","['Christiansen, D H', 'Andersen, M K', 'Pedersen-Bjergaard, J']","['Christiansen DH', 'Andersen MK', 'Pedersen-Bjergaard J']","['Section of Hematology and Oncology, Cytogenetic Laboratory, and Department of Clinical Genetics, The Juliane Marie Center, Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen, Denmark.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: From March 1991 to April 1995, a total of 705 patients, with 59% of the cohort of patients fewer than 15 years old, with newly diagnosed non-B ALL, enrolled onto the Associazione Italiana Ematologia Oncologia Pediatrica (AIEOP) ALL-91 study, were assigned to the IR group. Patients in remission at the beginning of the reinduction phase were randomized either to the standard treatment (SD ASP arm) or the experimental treatment (HD ASP arm; weekly intramuscular administration of HD ASP 25,000 IU/m(2) repeated for a total of 20 weeks). Most of the patients (90%) were treated with Erwinia chrysanthemi L-asparaginase product. RESULTS: Among the 610 patients randomized to the SD ASP arm (n = 322) or to the HD ASP arm (n = 288), relapse occurred at a median time of 24 months after randomization in 76 (24%) and in 64 children (22%), respectively. Most of the relapses occurred in the marrow (100 isolated, 21 combined). There was no significant difference between the disease-free survival in the two treatment arms (P =.64), with estimated values at 7 years from randomization of 72.4% (SE 3.1) v 75.7% (SE 2.6) in the SD ASP and HD ASP arms, respectively.

Because glutathione S-transferases may be involved in the metabolism of chemotherapy drugs, we hypothesized that presence or absence of the genes may influence the outcome of treatment for childhood acute myeloid leukemia (AML). PATIENTS AND METHODS: We genotyped GSTT1 and GSTM1 in 306 children with AML receiving chemotherapy on Children's Cancer Group therapeutic studies. Outcomes were compared in those with and without GSTT1 and GSTM1 genes. RESULTS: Patients with the GSTT1-negative genotype had reduced survival compared with those with at least one GSTT1 allele (GSTT1 positive) (52% v 40% at 5 years; log-rank P =.05). A multivariate model of survival adjusted for age group, sex, WBC count, chloroma, CNS involvement, and French-American-British group confirmed the increased risk of death in the GSTT1-null cases (relative risk, AQ 1.6; P =.02). The frequency of death in remission was increased in GSTT1-negative cases compared with GSTT1-positive cases (24% v 12%, log-rank P =.05). The frequency of relapse from end of induction was similar in GSTT1-negative and GSTT1-positive cases (38% v 35%, log-rank P =.5). CONCLUSION: Children who lacked GSTT1 had greater toxicity and reduced survival after chemotherapy for AML compared with children with at least one GSTT1 allele. If confirmed in further studies, GSTT1 genotype might be useful in selecting appropriate chemotherapy regimens for children with AML.","['Davies, S M', 'Robison, L L', 'Buckley, J D', 'Tjoa, T', 'Woods, W G', 'Radloff, G A', 'Ross, J A', 'Perentesis, J P']","['Davies SM', 'Robison LL', 'Buckley JD', 'Tjoa T', 'Woods WG', 'Radloff GA', 'Ross JA', 'Perentesis JP']","['Department of Pediatrics, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN, USA. davie008@tc.umn.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', 'EC 2.5.1.- (glutathione S-transferase T1)', 'EC 2.5.1.18 (Glutathione Transferase)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'DNA, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Female', 'Genotype', 'Glutathione Transferase/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*drug therapy/*genetics', 'Male', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', '*Polymorphism, Genetic', 'Prognosis', 'Recurrence', 'Risk Assessment', 'Survival Analysis']",,2001/03/07 10:00,2001/04/03 10:01,['2001/03/07 10:00'],"['2001/03/07 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/04/03 10:01 [medline]', '2001/03/07 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2001 Mar 1;19(5):1279-87. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2001.19.5.1279.,,,['10.1200/JCO.2001.19.5.1279 [doi]'],,['5U10-CA13539/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,

These data, compared to those of a 1985 survey, indicate variations in species distribution, with the proportions of C. glabrata and C. parapsilosis increasing by 9 and 4%, respectively, and those of C. albicans and C. tropicalis decreasing by 10 and 7%, respectively. However, these differences are statistically significant for C. glabrata and C. tropicalis only. MICs of amphotericin B were > or =4 microg/ml for 3% of isolates, all of which were non-C. albicans species. Three percent of C. albicans isolates were resistant to flucytosine (> or =32 microg/ml).

Clinical data were obtained for 343 patients. The overall crude mortality rate was 38%, reflecting the multiple serious underlying illnesses found in these patients. Bloodstream infections were documented for 249 patients (73%). Overall, systemic triazoles had been administered to 10% of patients before the onset of candidiasis. The frequency of isolation of non-C. albicans species was significantly higher in this group of patients. Overall, only two C. albicans isolates were found to be resistant to fluconazole. These were obtained from an AIDS patient and a leukemia patient, both of whom had a history of previous exposure to fluconazole.

Free TFPI is the most potent and important type, because it is released from endothelial cells following an injection of heparin, or as a result of pathological stimuli. In order to study the role of TFPI in disease, the concentration of free form TFPI was measured in the plasma of 114 patients suffering from disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), as the result of several underlying diseases. Plasma antigen levels of free TFPI were significantly higher even in those patients not exhibiting DIC than in normal healthy subjects. These levels were even higher among patients exhibiting DIC, especially those with acute promyelocytic leukemia or cancer, receiving continuous heparin drip infusions. A significant correlation was observed between the plasma antigen levels of free form TFPI and those of fibrin/fibrinogen degradation products, and free form TFPI and plasmin inhibitor complex (r = 0.428, P < 0.0001 and r = 0.329, P < 0.0001, respectively) among 114 DIC patients. There were no significant differences between the plasma levels of free TFPI in DIC patients with or without multiple organ failure. It has been suggested that the plasma levels of free TFPI are closely related to the levels of fibrinolysis occurring in DIC patients, although further study is required to clarify the degree to which TFPI is expressed by endothelial cells during DIC.","['Asakura, H', 'Ontachi, Y', 'Mizutani, T', 'Kato, M', 'Saito, M', 'Morishita, E', 'Yamazaki, M', 'Suga, Y', 'Takami, A', 'Miyamoto, K', 'Nakao, S']","['Asakura H', 'Ontachi Y', 'Mizutani T', 'Kato M', 'Saito M', 'Morishita E', 'Yamazaki M', 'Suga Y', 'Takami A', 'Miyamoto K', 'Nakao S']","['Department of Internal Medicine III, Kanazawa University School of Medicine, Japan. hasakura@med3.m.kanazawa-u.ac.jp']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Blood Coagul Fibrinolysis,Blood coagulation & fibrinolysis : an international journal in haemostasis and thrombosis,9102551,"['0 (Fibrin Fibrinogen Degradation Products)', '0 (Fibrinolytic Agents)', '0 (Lipoproteins)', '0 (lipoprotein-associated coagulation inhibitor)']",IM,"['Case-Control Studies', 'Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation/*blood/etiology', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Fibrin Fibrinogen Degradation Products/metabolism', 'Fibrinolytic Agents/blood', 'Humans', 'Lipoproteins/*blood', 'Multiple Organ Failure/etiology', 'Neoplasms/complications', 'Statistics, Nonparametric']",,2001/03/07 10:00,2001/07/28 10:01,['2001/03/07 10:00'],"['2001/03/07 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/07/28 10:01 [medline]', '2001/03/07 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood Coagul Fibrinolysis. 2001 Jan;12(1):1-8. doi: 10.1097/00001721-200101000-00001.,,,['10.1097/00001721-200101000-00001 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Serum deprivation induced apoptosis in CEM-C7H2 (CEM) and to a lesser extent in CEM-9F3, a subline overexpressing Bcl-2. Addition of CoQ10 to serum-free media decreased apoptosis in both cell lines. Serum withdrawal induced an early increase of neutral-sphingomyelinase activity, release of ceramide, and activation of caspase-3 in both cell lines, but this effect was more pronounced in CEM cells. CoQ10 prevented activation of this cascade of events. Lipids extracted from serum-depleted cultures activated caspase-3 independently of the presence of mitochondria in cell-free in vitro assays. Activation of caspase-3 by lipid extracts or ceramide was prevented by okadaic acid, indicating the implication of a phosphatase in this process. Our results support the hypothesis that plasma membrane CoQ10 regulate the initiation phase of serum withdrawal-induced apoptosis by preventing oxidative damage and thus avoiding activation of downstream effectors as neutral-sphingomyelinase and subsequent ceramide release and caspase activation pathways.","['Fernandez-Ayala, D J', 'Martin, S F', 'Barroso, M P', 'Gomez-Diaz, C', 'Villalba, J M', 'Rodriguez-Aguilera, J C', 'Lopez-Lluch, G', 'Navas, P']","['Fernandez-Ayala DJ', 'Martin SF', 'Barroso MP', 'Gomez-Diaz C', 'Villalba JM', 'Rodriguez-Aguilera JC', 'Lopez-Lluch G', 'Navas P']","['Laboratorio Andaluz de Biologia, Universidad Pablo de Olavide, Sevilla, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Antioxid Redox Signal,Antioxidants & redox signaling,100888899,"['0 (Caspase Inhibitors)', '0 (Ceramides)', '0 (Coenzymes)', '0 (Culture Media, Serum-Free)', '1339-63-5 (Ubiquinone)', '1W21G5Q4N2 (Okadaic Acid)', 'EC 1.9.3.1 (Electron Transport Complex IV)', 'EC 3.1.4.12 (Sphingomyelin Phosphodiesterase)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EJ27X76M46 (coenzyme Q10)']",IM,"['*Apoptosis', 'Caspase 3', '*Caspase Inhibitors', 'Cell Membrane/metabolism', 'Cell-Free System', 'Ceramides/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Coenzymes', 'Culture Media, Serum-Free', 'Electron Transport Complex IV/metabolism', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/metabolism', 'Lipid Metabolism', 'Mitochondria/metabolism', 'Okadaic Acid/metabolism', 'Oxidative Stress', 'Sphingomyelin Phosphodiesterase/metabolism', 'Time Factors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Ubiquinone/analogs & derivatives/*metabolism']",,2001/03/07 10:00,2001/06/08 10:01,['2001/03/07 10:00'],"['2001/03/07 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/06/08 10:01 [medline]', '2001/03/07 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Antioxid Redox Signal. 2000 Summer;2(2):263-75. doi: 10.1089/ars.2000.2.2-263.,,,['10.1089/ars.2000.2.2-263 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Simultaneous localization in the eyelid and in the breast, as observed in our case, is however exceptional. CASE REPORT: Chronic lymphoid leukemia (CLL) was suspected in a 71-year-old woman with asthenia, a cervical and axillary nodal enlargement and elevated lymphocyte count. Blood immunoflow cytometry analysis, occurrence of rapidly growing tumors involving the two breasts and eyelids and cytogenetic and molecular features led to the diagnosis of MCL. A very good partial remission was obtained with second-line polychemotherapy composed of cytarabin, cisplatin and dexamethasone, but lasted only 3 months after the end of 6 cycles. DISCUSSION: Primary breast and eyelid lymphomas are rare. Such localizations are exceptional in MCL and are signs of aggressive disease. Before extra-nodal involvement, MCL may simulate banal CLL. Therefore, systematic immunohistochemistry and if necessary molecular analysis are useful for early diagnosis of MCL. Prognosis is particularly poor. Conventional chemotherapy cannot provide cure of MCL and median survival is 48 months. For this reason, high-dose chemotherapy with stem cell graft has to be discussed in young patients. MCL is currently characterized by Bcl1 rearrangement, t(11-14) translocation and cyclin D1 overexpression among small B-cell lymphomas in recent REAL- and WHO-classifications.","['Boullanger, N', 'Renou, P', 'Dugay, J', 'Boyer, J', 'de Yberlucea, L R', 'Combe, M', 'Coulon, M A']","['Boullanger N', 'Renou P', 'Dugay J', 'Boyer J', 'de Yberlucea LR', 'Combe M', 'Coulon MA']","['Departement de Medecine interne et Onco-hematologie, Centre Hospitalier, F72037 Le Mans.']",['fre'],"['Case Reports', 'English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",France,Presse Med,"Presse medicale (Paris, France : 1983)",8302490,,IM,"['Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Breast Neoplasms/diagnosis/*pathology/therapy', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Eyelid Neoplasms/diagnosis/*pathology/therapy', 'Female', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Lymphoma, Mantle-Cell/diagnosis/*pathology/therapy', 'Prognosis']",,2001/03/07 10:00,2001/03/17 10:01,['2001/03/07 10:00'],"['2001/03/07 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/17 10:01 [medline]', '2001/03/07 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Presse Med. 2001 Feb 3;30(4):163-5.,Localisation mammaire et palpebrale d'un lymphome du manteau.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The present study was planned to estimate serum vitamin E levels in patients of chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML). METHODS: Serum vitamin E levels were estimated in 25 CML patients before and after the treatment. Twenty five age and sex matched healthy individuals served as control. RESULTS: Mean serum vitamin E levels were significantly decreased in CML patients before starting the treatment as compared to control. Also, vitamin E levels increased significantly after the treatment, but, remained lower than the control. CONCLUSION: Vitamin E levels were lower in CML patients as compared to control and the levels increased significantly after treatment in these patients. This could be due to decrease in oxidative stress due to decrease in tumour load.","['Singh, V', 'Kharb, S', 'Ghalaut, P S', 'Gupta, S']","['Singh V', 'Kharb S', 'Ghalaut PS', 'Gupta S']","['Pt.

Growing evidence indicates that hTRX/ADF plays important roles in cellular responses against oxidative stress and is involved in a variety of cellular functions. A high level of hTRX/ADF expression is also observed in other human virus-infected cell lines including those of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and human papillomavirus. In this report, we analyzed the effect of hTRX/ADF on lytic amplification and persistent replication of EBV as a model for lytic versus latent phase of viral replication in host cells. Addition of hTRX/ADF clearly suppressed lytic replication of EBV in Raji cells and B95-8 cells induced to the lytic phase of 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA), and it prevented the death of these cells evoked by the lytic induction. In contrast, hTRX/ADF did not have any effect on persistent replication in the latent phase. These data indicated that hTRX/ADF prevents EBV-transformed cells from proceeding into the lytic phase and regulates cohabitation of EBV and its host cells.","['Sono, H', 'Teshigawara, K', 'Sasada, T', 'Takagi, Y', 'Nishiyama, A', 'Ohkubo, Y', 'Maeda, Y', 'Tatsumi, E', 'Kanamaru, A', 'Yodoi, J']","['Sono H', 'Teshigawara K', 'Sasada T', 'Takagi Y', 'Nishiyama A', 'Ohkubo Y', 'Maeda Y', 'Tatsumi E', 'Kanamaru A', 'Yodoi J']","['Department of Biological Responses, Institute for Virus Research, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Antioxid Redox Signal,Antioxidants & redox signaling,100888899,"['0 (Carcinogens)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (adult T cell leukemia-derived factor)', '52500-60-4 (Thioredoxins)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Carcinogens/pharmacology', 'Cell Death/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Transformed/virology', 'Cell Transformation, Viral/genetics', 'Cytokines/genetics/metabolism/*physiology', 'DNA Replication/genetics', 'DNA, Viral/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics', 'Gene Amplification', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Viral', 'Herpesvirus 4, Human/genetics/*metabolism/*pathogenicity/physiology', 'Humans', 'Infectious Mononucleosis/genetics/*metabolism/*virology', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/virology', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics/metabolism/*physiology', 'Oxidation-Reduction', 'Suppression, Genetic', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Thioredoxins/*pharmacology', '*Virus Replication/genetics']",,2001/03/07 10:00,2001/04/03 10:01,['2001/03/07 10:00'],"['2001/03/07 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/04/03 10:01 [medline]', '2001/03/07 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Antioxid Redox Signal. 1999 Summer;1(2):155-65. doi: 10.1089/ars.1999.1.2-155.,,,['10.1089/ars.1999.1.2-155 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the present report, we describe our observation that ATO is a potent antivascular agent and that it markedly enhances the effect of hyperthermia on tumors. The tumor blood perfusion in SCK tumors of A/J mice and FSaII tumors of C3H mice was significantly suppressed for up to 24 hours after an i.p. injection of 8 mg/kg ATO. ATO was also found to be able to increase the thermosensitivity of tumor cells in vitro. As a probable consequence of these effects, ATO treatment markedly increased the tumor growth delay caused by hyperthermia at 41.5 to 42.5 degrees C. Immunohistochemical staining of tumor tissue revealed that the expression levels of several adhesion molecules and TNFalpha are noticeably increased in tumors 2 to 6 hours after systemic ATO treatment. It is concluded that ATO is potentially useful to enhance the effect of hyperthermia on tumors at a clinically relevant temperature.","['Griffin, R J', 'Lee, S H', 'Rood, K L', 'Stewart, M J', 'Lyons, J C', 'Lew, Y S', 'Park, H', 'Song, C W']","['Griffin RJ', 'Lee SH', 'Rood KL', 'Stewart MJ', 'Lyons JC', 'Lew YS', 'Park H', 'Song CW']","['Department of Therapeutic Radiology-Radiation Oncology, University of Minnesota Medical School, Minneapolis, MN 55455, USA. griff007@tc.umn.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Neoplasia,"Neoplasia (New York, N.Y.)",100886622,"['0 (Angiogenesis Inhibitors)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (E-Selectin)', '0 (Oxides)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '0 (Vascular Cell Adhesion Molecule-1)', '126547-89-5 (Intercellular Adhesion Molecule-1)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)']",IM,"['Angiogenesis Inhibitors/*therapeutic use', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals/*therapeutic use', 'E-Selectin/metabolism', 'Female', 'Fibrosarcoma/*blood supply/pathology/therapy', '*Hyperthermia, Induced', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Intercellular Adhesion Molecule-1/metabolism', 'Male', 'Mammary Neoplasms, Experimental/*blood supply/pathology/therapy', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred A', 'Mice, Inbred C3H', 'Neovascularization, Pathologic/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Oxides/*therapeutic use', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/metabolism', 'Vascular Cell Adhesion Molecule-1/metabolism']",,2001/03/03 10:00,2002/04/02 10:01,['2001/03/03 10:00'],"['2001/03/03 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/04/02 10:01 [medline]', '2001/03/03 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Neoplasia. 2000 Nov-Dec;2(6):555-60. doi: 10.1038/sj.neo.7900123.,,,['10.1038/sj.neo.7900123 [doi]'],PMC1508087,"['R01 CA044114/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA44114/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Complementary DNA probes were prepared from mRNA extracted from colonic cancer specimens and adjacent normal mucosa and then were labeled with chemiluminescence. These labeled probes were allowed to bind to the gene fragments on the filter. A specialized scanning charge-coupled device camera measured the intensity of each chemiluminescent spot, which is an indicator of the degree to which a specific gene is expressed. Gene expression image was quantified into intensity of signals by using computer software. RESULTS: Characteristic gene expression patterns were obtained from the colonic cancer cell line, RPMI4788, and the leukemia cell line, HL60, by using this compact-sized DNA array filter in the preliminary experiment. Up-regulation of nm23, TIMP1, VEGF, and cyclin E and down-regulation of some tumor suppressor genes (p53, TOSO, and SIVA), beta-catenin, and metallothionein were observed in colonic cancer specimen when compared with those of normal mucosa. CONCLUSIONS: We have obtained unique gene expression patterns from colorectal cancer and normal tissue by using a newly developed compact-sized DNA array filter system. Collecting, storing, and analyzing of gene expression data from many samples of colorectal cancer will enable us to identify distinct subsets of patients based on molecular characteristics in the near future.","['Okuno, K', 'Yasutomi, M', 'Nishimura, N', 'Arakawa, T', 'Shiomi, M', 'Hida, J', 'Ueda, K', 'Minami, K']","['Okuno K', 'Yasutomi M', 'Nishimura N', 'Arakawa T', 'Shiomi M', 'Hida J', 'Ueda K', 'Minami K']","['The First Department of Surgery, Kinki University School of Medicine, Osaka-sayama, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Dis Colon Rectum,Diseases of the colon and rectum,0372764,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)']",IM,"['Cell Line', 'Colorectal Neoplasms/*genetics', 'DNA, Neoplasm/*analysis', 'Down-Regulation', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Humans', '*Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Up-Regulation']",,2001/03/03 10:00,2001/04/03 10:01,['2001/03/03 10:00'],"['2001/03/03 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/04/03 10:01 [medline]', '2001/03/03 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Dis Colon Rectum. 2001 Feb;44(2):295-9. doi: 10.1007/BF02234309.,,,['10.1007/BF02234309 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this report, we investigated whether TZT-1027 inhibited the growth of various human cancer cells, and the cell death caused by TZT-1027 was due to apoptosis. In addition, we elucidated the apoptosis machinery induced by treatment with TZT-1027. The 50% growth-inhibitory concentrations (IC50 values) of TZT-1027 on cancer cells derived from various sources were not more than 5.9 ng/ml. TZT-1027 showed superior cytotoxicity than any other antitumor agents. Next, we evaluated morphological nuclear change, namely, chromatin condensation and DNA fragmentation. We used three cancer cell lines derived from different types in view of having apoptosis related protein, human leukemia HL-60 (in the presence of both Caspase-3 and Bcl-2), human breast cancer MCF-7 (in the absence of Caspase-3), and human prostate cancer DU145 (in the absence of Bcl-2). TZT-1027 induced DNA fragmentation in the presence but not absence of Caspase-3. Nevertheless, apoptic chromatin condensation was observed in all cancer cells even if there was no Caspase-3. Furthermore, we examined whether TZT-1027, microtubule-disrupting agent, influenced cell cycle progression. Flow cytometric analysis revealed the cells treated with TZT-1027, and with the other antimicrotubule agents, to be arrested at the G2/M phase and subsequently to show fragmented DNA smaller than that of G1 phase cells. Moreover, we tested TZT-1027 for its ability to induce Bcl-2 phosphorylation in human cancer cell lines. TZT-1027 and other agents which interacted with microtubules induced Bcl-2 phosphorylation, whereas DNA-damaging agents did not. The present results suggested an association of the growth-inhibitory effect of TZT-1027 with the induction of apoptosis and indicated that the apoptosis induced by TZT-1027 was followed by G2/M arrest even if there was no Caspase-3 or Bcl-2.","['Watanabe, J', 'Natsume, T', 'Fujio, N', 'Miyasaka, K', 'Kobayashi, M']","['Watanabe J', 'Natsume T', 'Fujio N', 'Miyasaka K', 'Kobayashi M']","['Pharmacological Research Department, Teikoku Hormone Mfg.

Studies presented in this paper complement our previous work demonstrating that sustained induction of the proto-oncogene c-jun plays a crucial role in the glucocorticoid-induced apoptotic pathway in CEM cells, human leukemic lymphoblasts. Results from measurements of c-jun mRNA half-life with RNase protection assays and of transcription by nuclear run-on assays indicate that, in the dexamethasone-sensitive cloned CEM-C7 cells, c-jun is induced at the transcriptional level. Consideration of time-course, however, suggested that this might be a secondary or possibly a delayed primary response. Use of cycloheximide to block protein synthesis strongly induced c-jun mRNA, suggesting that there had been relief from a labile protein repressor of transcription. Comparing the level of induction by cycloheximide with that of dexamethasone indicated that the two did not induce by an identical mechanism. The high induction by cycloheximide obscured simple interpretation of elevated c-jun mRNA levels after concomitant administration of cycloheximide and dexamethasone. This was resolved by nuclear run-on experiments, which showed that the dexamethasone induction of c-jun mRNA in this system does require protein synthesis.","['Zhou, F', 'Medh, R D', 'Zhang, W', 'Ansari, N H', 'Thompson, E B']","['Zhou F', 'Medh RD', 'Zhang W', 'Ansari NH', 'Thompson EB']","['Department of Human Biological Chemistry and Genetics, The University of Texas Medical Branch, Galveston, TX 77555-0645, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,J Steroid Biochem Mol Biol,The Journal of steroid biochemistry and molecular biology,9015483,"['0 (Glucocorticoids)', '0 (MAS1 protein, human)', '0 (Protein Synthesis Inhibitors)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Mas)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Glucocorticoid)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)', '98600C0908 (Cycloheximide)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",IM,"['*Apoptosis/drug effects/genetics/physiology', 'Blotting, Western', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Cell Fractionation', 'Cycloheximide/pharmacology', 'Dexamethasone/*pharmacology', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Female', '*Gene Expression Regulation', '*Genes, jun', 'Glucocorticoids/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid', 'Lymphocytes/*physiology', 'Protein Synthesis Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Mas', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Receptors, Glucocorticoid/genetics/*metabolism', 'Time Factors', '*Transcription, Genetic/drug effects', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,2001/02/28 10:00,2001/04/06 10:01,['2001/02/28 10:00'],"['2001/02/28 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/04/06 10:01 [medline]', '2001/02/28 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Steroid Biochem Mol Biol. 2000 Dec 15;75(2-3):91-9. doi: 10.1016/s0960-0760(00)00161-8.,,,"['S0960-0760(00)00161-8 [pii]', '10.1016/s0960-0760(00)00161-8 [doi]']",PMC2768356,"['R01 CA041407/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA041407-14/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,['NIHMS147929'],

However, the mechanisms of the transcriptional activation of this gene remain unclear. In this study, we examined the molecular mechanisms underlying phorbol ester mediated gene regulation using human K562 leukemia cells as a model. Promoter deletion analyses revealed that the activator protein-1 (AP-1) transcription factor site was crucial for 12-O-tetradecanoyl phorbol 13-acetate (TPA)-mediated GSTP1 gene transcription. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays and transient transfection analysis demonstrated that both DNA binding and transactivation activities of AP-1 were induced by TPA. By supershift analysis, we identified transcription factors c-jun and fra-1 as well as NF-E2p45 as components of the induced binding complex. These results show for the first time that the phorbol ester TPA is involved in the molecular mechanism(s) mediating the activation of the GSTP1 promoter in a human leukemia model.","['Borde-Chiche, P', 'Diederich, M', 'Morceau, F', 'Wellman, M', 'Dicato, M']","['Borde-Chiche P', 'Diederich M', 'Morceau F', 'Wellman M', 'Dicato M']","['Laboratoire de Recherche sur le Cancer et les Maladies du Sang (RCMS), Centre Universitaire de Luxembourg, 162A, avenue de la Faiencerie, L-1511 Luxembourg, Luxembourg.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,"['0 (BCL2-related protein A1)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Erythroid-Specific DNA-Binding Factors)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (MATA1 protein, S cerevisiae)', '0 (Minor Histocompatibility Antigens)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-jun)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (Saccharomyces cerevisiae Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', 'EC 2.5.1.18 (Glutathione Transferase)', 'EC 3.6.4.- (Replication Protein C)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Binding Sites', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/metabolism', 'Erythroid-Specific DNA-Binding Factors', 'Gene Expression Regulation/drug effects', 'Glutathione Transferase/*genetics', '*Homeodomain Proteins', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Minor Histocompatibility Antigens', 'Nuclear Proteins/metabolism', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/*drug effects', 'Protein Binding/drug effects', '*Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-jun/metabolism', 'Replication Protein C', 'Repressor Proteins/metabolism', '*Saccharomyces cerevisiae Proteins', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/*pharmacology', 'Transcription Factors/analysis/metabolism']",,2001/02/28 10:00,2001/04/21 10:01,['2001/02/28 10:00'],"['2001/02/28 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/04/21 10:01 [medline]', '2001/02/28 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 2001 Mar;25(3):241-7. doi: 10.1016/s0145-2126(00)00118-1.,,,"['S0145-2126(00)00118-1 [pii]', '10.1016/s0145-2126(00)00118-1 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In AML AC133 correlated with CD34 expression (Spearman r=0.4711, P=0.0114) and even stronger with combined CD34/CD33 expression (Spearman r=0.5083, P=0.0068).

Endometrium is under the control of steroid hormones, particularly progesterone and, thus, control of cytokines by this steroid is important. Although appreciable numbers of progesterone receptors are not found in endometrial leucocytes, progesterone can modulate cytokines by acting on uterine cells expressing the receptor. The NFkappaB pathway is important in the control of cytokine synthesis and can modulate production of chemokines, matrix metalloproteinases and the inducible prostaglandin synthesis enzyme COX-2. NFkappaB activity can be inhibited by progesterone by either stimulating synthesis of IkappaB, the molecule that restrains NFkappaB in the cytosol, or after binding to the nuclear receptor, competing with NFkappaB for recognition sites on the relevant gene. In this way, progesterone can limit pro-inflammatory pathways. The major palliatives for endometrial dysfunctions such as menorrhagia and dysmenorrhoea have been the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs that inhibit prostaglandin synthesis. Prostaglandins have major effects on cytokine production but the direct action of prostaglandin E on leucocytes is not a pro-inflammatory response but is to stimulate interleukin 10 and inhibit interleukin 12 synthesis. The likely effect of the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs is on the cells surrounding the small blood vessels, where a synergistic action between prostaglandin and chemokine will induce leucocyte entry and activation leading to lysis of connective tissue and menstruation. At the time of implantation, tight control of cytokine synthesis is required. Although leukaemia inhibitory factor is essential to implantation, the mouse knockout models show that the prostaglandin system is also essential but that there are mutually supportive pathways that compensate for the knockout of many cytokines.","['Kelly, R W', 'King, A E', 'Critchley, H O']","['Kelly RW', 'King AE', 'Critchley HO']","['MRC Human Reproductive Sciences Unit Centre for Reproductive Biology, 37 Chalmers Street, Edinburgh EH3 9ET, UK. r.kelly@hrsu.mrc.ac.uk']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Reproduction,"Reproduction (Cambridge, England)",100966036,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (NF-kappa B)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cytokines/*physiology', 'Embryo Implantation/physiology', 'Endometrium/blood supply/cytology/*physiology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Menstruation/physiology', 'NF-kappa B/physiology', 'Pregnancy']",206,2001/02/28 10:00,2001/09/14 10:01,['2001/02/28 10:00'],"['2001/02/28 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/09/14 10:01 [medline]', '2001/02/28 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Reproduction. 2001 Jan;121(1):3-19. doi: 10.1530/rep.0.1210003.,,,['10.1530/rep.0.1210003 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In initial clinical trials the activity in small lymphocytic lymphoma, the counterpart of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), was less than 20%. In an attempt to increase the level of rituximab activity in CLL, we conducted a phase I dose-escalation study to overcome both the lower CD20 antigen density on CLL cells compared with lymphoma cells and the shorter half-life of rituximab in small lymphocytic lymphoma. Cohorts of patients were treated with escalated doses on weeks 2, 3, and 4 after an initial rituximab dose of 375 mg/m2 on day 1. The maximum dose of rituximab evaluated was 2,250 mg/m2. There is clear evidence of a dose-response relationship. Severe toxicity (grades 3 and 4) noted following the first dose of therapy in variant forms of CLL, namely mantle cell lymphoma and prolymphocytic leukemia, was uncommon in typical CLL. No unusual toxicity was noted at higher doses. Further exploration of the dosing schedule of rituximab in CLL and development of combination therapies is necessary.

This stealthlike phenotype can be reversed by activating neoplastic B cells through ligation of CD40, a cell surface molecule that can interact with a ligand expressed on activated T cells. The gene encoding this ligand, CD154, can be transferred into neoplastic B cells ex vivo through infection with a modified adenovirus vector called Ad-CD154. This results in a dramatic change in the phenotype and function of the neoplastic B cells. Infected malignant B cells can stimulate T cells reactive with potential tumor antigens and induce autologous cytotoxic T cells capable of destroying the neoplastic B cells in vitro. This formed the basis for an immune gene therapy protocol in which patients were infused with Ad-CD154-transduced leukemic B cells. Treatment was well tolerated, without apparent long-term toxicity, and without a maximum tolerated dose. Biologic and clinical responses were observed, including significant reductions in leukemia cell counts and lymph node sizes after a single one-time infusion. Furthermore, preliminary data suggest that this approach can enhance antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity and thereby augment the activity of antitumor monoclonal antibody therapy.

Pichia pastoris, and investigate the effects of recombinant human soluble Flt3 ligand (rhFL) on the proliferation of malignant hematopoietic cells(MHC) and the effect of dexamethasone (DXM) on the expression of Flt3 receptor (Flt3R) and the rhFL induced proliferation of those cells. METHODS: An artificial gene for rhFL was synthesized by using favored genetic codons of the yeast Pichia pastoris. Flt3R was determined by flow cytometry. Proliferation of MHCs was measured by microculture tetrazolium (MTT) assay. RESULTS: 1. An expression vector, pPICZ alpha A-FL, was constructed and electroporated into Pichia pastoris. A yield of over 30 mg/L of yeast culture supernatant was obtained. The rhFL could stimulate the proliferation of Raji and HL-60 cells at concentrations of 10-100 ng/ml, but did not for most of other MHCs. 2. Flt3R was expressed in 5 of 18 MHC lines and the expression in leukemic blast cells was widespread and extremely heterogeneous. 3. The presence of the receptor on the surface of MHC did not necessarily imply a significant ligand-induced response, at least in terms of proliferation. By contrast, some Flt3R-negative MHC responded to rhFL. 4. DXM down-regulated the expression of Flt3R and inhibited the proliferation induced by rhFL in some MHC lines and fresh leukemia cell samples. CONCLUSION: A yield of 30 mg/L of rhFL was obtained. rhFL stimulated the proliferation of Raji, HL-60 cells and some fresh leukemia cells, which could be inhibited by DXM through down-regulation of Flt3R. A combination of FL and DXM might possibly serve to control hematopoietic defects in malignant hematopoietic diseases.","['Xu, Z', 'Xu, Y', 'Zhu, J']","['Xu Z', 'Xu Y', 'Zhu J']","['Department of Immunology, Soochow University, Suzhou 215007, China.']",['chi'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",China,Zhonghua Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi,Zhonghua xue ye xue za zhi = Zhonghua xueyexue zazhi,8212398,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Hormonal)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (flt3 ligand protein)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents, Hormonal/pharmacology', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Dexamethasone/pharmacology', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Membrane Proteins/*pharmacology', 'Recombinant Proteins/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,2001/02/28 10:00,2002/10/04 04:00,['2001/02/28 10:00'],"['2001/02/28 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/10/04 04:00 [medline]', '2001/02/28 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Zhonghua Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi. 2000 Nov;21(11):595-9.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: FBL-3 murine erythroleukemia cells were transfected with mGM-CSF recombinant adenovirus and then irradiated to prepare vaccine. The specific cytotoxic T lymphocyte(CTL) activity in vivo and survival of the mice i.p. immunized with this vaccine were observed. The percentage of 33D1+ dendritic cells(DCs) in peritoneal adherent cells were analyzed with flow cytometry. The number of peritoneal cell and function of peritoneal adherent cells of immunized mice were also investigated. RESULTS: High level of specific CTL activity were induced in the mice i.p. immunized with this vaccine and all of the mice were resistant to the subsequent challenge with the parental FBL-3 cells. The number of peritoneal APCs-increased. FACS analysis showed that the percentage of 33D1+ DCs in peritoneal adherent cells also increased. The allo-mixed lymphocyte reaction(MLR) stimulating activity of these APCs was enhanced. CONCLUSION: mGM-CSF gene-modified tumor vaccine has potent anti-tumor effect, and this may be related to the increased number and function of peritoneal APCs induced by mGM-CSF through paracrine mechanism at the vaccination site.","['Zhu, X', 'Huang, X', 'Zhang, W']","['Zhu X', 'Huang X', 'Zhang W']","['Department of Immunology, Second Military Medical University, Shanghai 200433, China.']",['chi'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",China,Zhonghua Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi,Zhonghua xue ye xue za zhi = Zhonghua xueyexue zazhi,8212398,"['0 (Cancer Vaccines)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigen-Presenting Cells/*immunology', 'Cancer Vaccines/*immunology', 'Dendritic Cells/immunology', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/*genetics', 'Immunotherapy', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*immunology/therapy', 'Male', 'Mice', 'T-Lymphocyte Subsets/immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/immunology']",,2001/02/28 10:00,2002/10/04 04:00,['2001/02/28 10:00'],"['2001/02/28 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/10/04 04:00 [medline]', '2001/02/28 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Zhonghua Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi. 2000 Nov;21(11):591-4.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

DESIGN AND METHODS: Repeat FISH analyses were performed in 77 patients with a chronic leukemic B-cell disorder. The aim was to study the development of the trisomy 12 clone throughout the course of the disease, to measure the effect of therapy on the proportion of trisomic cells, and to relate the findings to the response to therapy. RESULTS: Fifty-eight of the 60 patients with no trisomy 12 at the initial test were consistently disomic for chromosome 12, while 2 patients seemingly acquired trisomy 12 during follow-up. Seventeen patients showed trisomy 12 at the first test. Expansion of the trisomy 12 clone was seen in all patients with a progressive lymphocytosis. In contrast to poor responders, patients responding well to chemotherapy showed a significant decrease in the proportion of CD19+ cells with trisomy 12. The effect of purine analogs in patients with trisomy 12 seemed inferior, both clinically and when studying the effect on the trisomic clone. INTERPRETATIONS AND CONCLUSIONS: There is a strong association between expansion of the trisomy 12 clone and progressive disease, both in treated and untreated patients. Conversely, reduction of the trisomic B-cell clone was linked to clinical response to chemotherapy.

There is some evidence that increased bcr-abl expression levels, possibly due to gene amplification, precede the clonal evolution of CML hematopoietic progenitors toward a fully transformed phenotype and might be involved in their resistance to interferon-alpha or tyrosine kinase inhibitors. DESIGN AND METHODS: To quantify the bcr-abl gene both at the genomic and at the transcriptional levels we developed a competitive polymerase chain reaction (PCR) strategy. The competitive PCR technique is based upon the co-amplification of the sample template (target) together with increasing amounts of a DNA fragment (competitor) sharing with the target the primer recognition sites, but differing in size. We constructed a competitor for the quantification of both b2a2 and b3a2 alternative splicing forms of the bcr-abl chimera and established the accuracy and reproducibility of our competitive strategy in a clone of the murine 32DG hematopoietic cell line (32D LG7), which bears a stable integration of a single copy of p210 bcr-abl fusion gene. We utilized this technique to follow, over a period of 200 days, the fusion gene copy numbers and transcription rates in several p210 bcr-abl-transduced 32D cell clones, an experimental condition mimicking the evolution of CML myeloid progenitors in vivo. RESULTS: Our results are consistent with p210 bcr-abl overexpression but not gene amplification associated with their clonal evolution. Increased p210 bcr-abl transcription rate is associated with the abrogation of radiation-induced apoptotic cell death, suggesting a role for the chimeric gene expression level in cell life expectancy after a genotoxic insult. INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that the assessment of gene amplification and expression might serve to improve prognostic classification and follow-up of CML patients.","['Campanini, F', 'Santucci, M A', 'Pattachini, L', 'Brusa, G', 'Piccioli, M', 'Barbieri, E', 'Babini, L', 'Tura, S']","['Campanini F', 'Santucci MA', 'Pattachini L', 'Brusa G', 'Piccioli M', 'Barbieri E', 'Babini L', 'Tura S']","['Istituto di Ematologia e Oncologia Medica L.A.

The identification of these chromosomal abnormalities helps not only to define different AML subtypes with distinct prognoses and treatments but also to monitor the disappearance of malignant cells after treatment. Recent reports suggest that the frequency of these alterations may differ according to geographic distribution. However, most of these reports focus on just one or two genetic alterations, which may lead to some selection bias. Appropriate epidemiological studies should be based on unselected consecutive series of patients in which all relevant genes are simultaneously analyzed. The aim of the present study was to explore whether or not the incidence of genetic lesions in Spanish AML patients differs from that reported in other countries. DESIGN AND METHODS: In a series of 145 consecutive un-selected adult patients with AML we simultaneously analyzed the presence of 4 genetic abnormalities, PML/RARalpha for t(15;17), AML1/ETO for t(8;21), CBFbeta/MYH11 for inv(16)/t(16;16) and rearrangements of the MLL gene for 11q23 abnormalities. AML were classified using the new World Health Organization (WHO) classification for hematologic malignancies. The techniques used were standardized according to the recommendations of the European BIOMED-1 Concerted Action. RESULTS: The PML/RARalpha transcript was present in 34 patients (23.4%) (23 were bcr1, 2 bcr2 and 9 bcr3). The AML1/ETO fusion transcript was detected in only 2 cases (1.4%) both with M2 morphology, but 29 other cases with M2 morphology were negative. CBFbeta/MYH11 transcript was present in 9 cases (6.2%) eight of them displaying M4Eo morphology. Finally, 5 cases (3.5%) showed rearrangements of theMLL gene. Our results differ from those reported from the United States and North/Central Europe, particularly regarding the incidence of t(15;17) and t(8;21) translocations. In Spain the frequency of t(15;17) is higher while that of t(8;21) is lower. INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: These data add epidemiological information about geographic heterogeneity of such chromosome aberrations in AML and would contribute to the design of specific screening strategies adapted to the incidence in each country.","['Chillon, C M', 'Garcia-Sanz, R', 'Balanzategui, A', 'Ramos, F', 'Fernandez-Calvo, J', 'Rodriguez, M J', 'Rodriguez-Salazar, M I', 'Corrales, A', 'Calmuntia, M J', 'Orfao, A', 'Gonzalez, M', 'San Miguel, J F']","['Chillon CM', 'Garcia-Sanz R', 'Balanzategui A', 'Ramos F', 'Fernandez-Calvo J', 'Rodriguez MJ', 'Rodriguez-Salazar MI', 'Corrales A', 'Calmuntia MJ', 'Orfao A', 'Gonzalez M', 'San Miguel JF']","['Department of Hematology, University Hospital of Salamanca, Paseo de San Vicente, 58-182, Salamanca 37007, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Child', 'Chromosome Aberrations/*genetics', 'Female', 'Gene Frequency', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*classification/epidemiology/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Spain/epidemiology', 'World Health Organization']",,2001/02/27 10:00,2001/08/17 10:01,['2001/02/27 10:00'],"['2001/02/27 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/08/17 10:01 [medline]', '2001/02/27 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2001 Feb;86(2):162-6.,,,,,,,['Haematologica. 2001 Jun;86(6):561-2.

Up to now, only few studies with small numbers of cases have examined AC133 (recently designated CD133) expression in acute leukemia. To determine the value of this Moab for acute leukemia immunophenotyping, we investigated a large series of leukemic cell samples for their reactivity with Moab AC133. DESIGN AND METHODS. A total of 298 cell samples from patients with de novo acute myeloid leukemia (AML) (n=142), acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) (n=119), CD34+ve biphenotypic acute leukemia (n=13), and CD34+ve CML blast crisis (=BC; 21 myeloid BC/3 lymphoid BC) were investigated by flow cytometry for Moab AC133 reactivity.CD133 expression was compared with CD90(Thy-1) expression, another CD34-associated antigen. RESULTS: Fifteen (5%) samples expressed CD90, whereas 114 (38%) samples were positive for Moab AC133 (20% cut-off level). No significant differences in CD133 and CD90 expression levels between AML and ALL were observed. In AML, but not ALL, CD133 was more often expressed in CD34+ve cases than in CD34-ve ones (p<0.00001). However, CD133 expression was not restricted to CD34+ve leukemic cells in individual cell samples. All 8 pro-B-ALL cell samples with 11q23-anomalies and MLL (mixed lineage leukemia) gene translocations were positive for CD133, whereas only 2 of 9 pro-B-ALL without MLL gene translocations expressed CD133 (p<0.002). In contrast, none of the 5 AML cell samples with a t(9;11) and MLL gene translocation reacted with Moab AC133. CD34+ve CML cells in myeloid BC were less often positive for CD133 than CD34+ve de novo AML cells (p<0.0001). INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: CD133 and CD90 expression analysis is not helpful for lineage determination in acute leukemia immunophenotyping. However, MoabAC133 may be an informative marker for the detection and further characterization of immature AML cells, as well as pro-B-ALL cells with MLL gene translocations, by flow cytometry.","['Wuchter, C', 'Ratei, R', 'Spahn, G', 'Schoch, C', 'Harbott, J', 'Schnittger, S', 'Haferlach, T', 'Creutzig, U', 'Sperling, C', 'Karawajew, L', 'Ludwig, W D']","['Wuchter C', 'Ratei R', 'Spahn G', 'Schoch C', 'Harbott J', 'Schnittger S', 'Haferlach T', 'Creutzig U', 'Sperling C', 'Karawajew L', 'Ludwig WD']","['Robert-Rossle-Clinic, Charite, Humboldt University of Berlin, Lindenberger Weg 80, 13125 Berlin, Germany. wuchter@rrk-berlin.de']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,"['0 (AC133 Antigen)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Glycoproteins)', '0 (PROM1 protein, human)', '0 (Peptides)', '0 (Thy-1 Antigens)']",IM,"['AC133 Antigen', 'Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Antigens, CD', 'Antigens, CD34/metabolism', 'Cell Lineage/immunology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Glycoproteins/immunology/*metabolism', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/immunology', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Infant', 'Leukemia/*blood/immunology', 'Middle Aged', 'Peptides/immunology/*metabolism', 'Thy-1 Antigens/*metabolism']",,2001/02/27 10:00,2001/08/17 10:01,['2001/02/27 10:00'],"['2001/02/27 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/08/17 10:01 [medline]', '2001/02/27 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2001 Feb;86(2):154-61.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Use of newer antifolates in clinical trials.,121-7,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Methotrexate (MTX) is a key drug in the curative regimen of children with acute lymphocytic leukemia. This drug is widely used not only in the treatment of neoplastic diseases such as leukemia, lymphoma, choriocarcinoma, head and neck cancer and osteogenic sarcoma, but also for various autoimmune diseases, e.g., rheumatoid arthritis and psoriasis, and for the prevention of graft-versus-host disease after transplantation. The development of drug resistance is the limiting factor in the use of MTX. This review will outline the mechanisms of acquired and natural resistance to MTX that have been studied in patients affected by acute lymphocytic leukemia and acute myelocytic leukemia and the cell cycle genes involved in MTX resistance. This information may improve the use of MTX or could lead to the development of better drugs. Moreover a short description of newer antifolates with their mechanisms of action is presented. EVIDENCE AND INFORMATION SOURCES: The authors of this review have a long-standing interest in the mechanism of action of and resistance to MTX and other antifolates. Information from journal articles covered by the Science Citation Index and Medline has been reviewed together with work performed by the authors. PERSPECTIVES: Antifolates continue to be an extremely important class of drugs for the treatment of non-neoplastic as well as neoplastic diseases. New inhibitors that target dihydrofolate reductase as well as other folate-dependent enzymes are being evaluated in the clinic, and show promise.","['Longo-Sorbello, G S', 'Bertino, J R']","['Longo-Sorbello GS', 'Bertino JR']","['Divisione di Ematologia, Centro di Riferimento Oncologico, Ospedale S.

Conditioning regimens included standard total body irradiation + cyclophosphamide (CY), or busulphan + CY, whereas VP-16 was added in patients with advanced disease. Overall comparable numbers of mononuclear cells, CD34+ cells and CD3+ T cells were infused in each group. A significantly higher CD3+ T cell number was observed in MM and AML than in CML patients 1 month after transplant. However, MM patients showed a faster and better recovery of CD4+ T cells than both AML and CML patients at 3 months (P = 0.01 and P = 0.01, respectively) and 12 months (P = 0.01 vs AML, while P = NS vs CML) after transplant, and had a CD4:CD8 ratio > 1 with a median CD4+ T cell value > 400/microl 1 year after transplant. Development of acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) did not affect CD4:CD8 ratios but patients who experienced acute GVHD > grade I had lower CD4+ and CD8+ T cell numbers at all time points. However, after excluding patients with GVHD > grade I, MM patients still showed a significantly higher CD4+ T cell value than patients with myeloproliferative diseases 1 year after transplant. These findings suggest that although allogeneic PBSC transplantation induces rapid immune reconstitution, different kinetics may occur among patients with hematological malignancies. In particular, the rapid reconstitution of CD4+ T cells in MM patients may contribute to the low transplant-related mortality achieved in this disease.","['Rondelli, D', 'Re, F', 'Bandini, G', 'Raspadori, D', 'Arpinati, M', 'Senese, B', 'Stanzani, M', 'Bonifazi, F', 'Falcioni, S', 'Chirumbolo, G', 'Tura, S']","['Rondelli D', 'Re F', 'Bandini G', 'Raspadori D', 'Arpinati M', 'Senese B', 'Stanzani M', 'Bonifazi F', 'Falcioni S', 'Chirumbolo G', 'Tura S']","[""Institute of Hematology and Medical Oncology 'Seragnoli', University of Bologna, Italy.""]",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Bone Marrow Transplant,Bone marrow transplantation,8702459,,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/cytology/immunology', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease/blood/etiology/immunology', 'Hematopoiesis', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Immune System/*cytology/immunology', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*therapy', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*therapy', 'Lymphocyte Subsets/*cytology/immunology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multiple Myeloma/*therapy', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",,2001/02/27 10:00,2001/07/13 10:01,['2001/02/27 10:00'],"['2001/02/27 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/07/13 10:01 [medline]', '2001/02/27 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Bone Marrow Transplant. 2000 Dec;26(12):1325-31. doi: 10.1038/sj.bmt.1702709.,,,['10.1038/sj.bmt.1702709 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The investigational endeavors of ovarian cryopreservation await the clinical experience of in vitro maturation of thawed primordial follicles, their in vitro fertilization, and embryo transfer. Although promising, this experience is not yet available. Moreover, the risk of possible reimplantation of malignant stem cells with the thawed cryoperserved ovary has been raised after experimental animal observations. Therefore, until these innovative endeavors prove successful, and in parallel with them, we attempted to minimize the gonadotoxic effect of chemotherapy by the cotreatment with a gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonistic analogue to induce a temporary prepubertal milieu. Whereas inhibin-B concentrations in serum may reflect the ovarian granulosa cell compartment, inhibin-A reflects luteal function. Immunoreactive inhibin-A and -B in these patients before, during, and after gonadotoxic chemotherapy were measured. METHODS: A prospective clinical protocol was undertaken in 44 women with lymphoma, aged 15--40 years, ten with leukemia and eight undergoing chemotherapeutic treatments for nonmalignant diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus or other autoimmune diseases. A monthly injection of depot D-TRP6-GnRH-a was administered from before the start of chemotherapy until its conclusion, up to a maximum of 6 months. A hormonal profile was taken before starting the GnRH-a/chemotherapy cotreatment, and monthly thereafter until the women resumed spontaneous ovulation. This group was compared with a control group of 55 women who had been treated with similar chemotherapy. Inhibin-A and -B immunoactivity was measured. RESULTS: Whereas all but one (40-year-old) of the surviving patients with GnRH-a/chemotherapy cotreatment group resumed spontaneous ovulation and menses within 6 months, fewer than half of the patients in the control group (chemotherapy without GnRH-A cotreatment) resumed ovarian function and regular cyclic activity (P <.05). The remaining 60% experienced premature ovarian failure (POF). Temporary increased follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) concentrations were experienced by almost a third of the patients resuming cyclic ovarian function, suggesting a reversible ovarian damage in a larger proportion of women than those experiencing POF. Inhibin-A and -B decreased during GnRH-a/chemotherapy cotreatment but increased to normal levels in patients who resumed regular ovarian cyclicity and/or spontaneously conceived, compared with low levels in those who developed POF. CONCLUSIONS: If these preliminary data are consistent in a larger group of patients, inhibin-A or -B concentrations may serve as prognostic factors to predict the resumption of ovarian function, in addition to the levels of FSH, luteinizing hormone, and estradiol. GnRH-a cotreatment should be considered for every woman of reproductive age who receives chemotherapy, in addition to assisted reproductive technology and the investigational attempts of ovarian cryopreservation for future in vitro maturation.","['Blumenfeld, Z']",['Blumenfeld Z'],"['Reproductive Endocrinology Section, Department of Ob/Gyn, Rambam Medical Center, Faculty of Medicine, Technion-Israel Institute of Technology, Haifa, Israel. bzeev@techunix.technion.ac.il']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Soc Gynecol Investig,Journal of the Society for Gynecologic Investigation,9433806,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Hormonal)', '08AN7WA2G0 (Triptorelin Pamoate)', '57285-09-3 (Inhibins)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*adverse effects', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Hormonal/administration & dosage', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Autoimmune Diseases/drug therapy', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Inhibins/blood', 'Leukemia/drug therapy', 'Lymphoma/drug therapy', 'Pregnancy', 'Primary Ovarian Insufficiency/*chemically induced/*prevention & control', 'Prospective Studies', 'Triptorelin Pamoate/administration & dosage']",,2001/02/27 10:00,2001/06/23 10:01,['2001/02/27 10:00'],"['2001/02/27 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/06/23 10:01 [medline]', '2001/02/27 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Soc Gynecol Investig. 2001 Jan-Feb;8(1 Suppl Proceedings):S60-4. doi: 10.1016/s1071-5576(00)00112-x.,,,"['S107155760000112X [pii]', '10.1016/s1071-5576(00)00112-x [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Our group has developed a model immunotherapy system using a chimeric construct containing an antibody V region fused to a T cell activation molecule (T body) introduced by transfection into cytotoxic T cell lines, or populations of activated primary T or natural killer (NK) cells. In this study we have optimized the conditions needed for efficient transduction of human peripheral lymphocytes (PBL) using retroviral vectors pseudotyped with the gibbon ape leukemia virus (GaLV) envelope. Selection of packaging cells producing high virus titers was performed following transfection with constructs containing the green fluorescent protein (GFP), and FACS sorting. As a model chimeric receptor gene we used a tripartite construct consisting of a single-chain anti-TNP antibody variable region linked to part of the extracellular domain and the membrane spanning regions of the CD28 coreceptor molecule and joined at its 5' end to a gene fragment encoding the intracellular moiety of the gamma activation molecule common to the Fcepsilon and Fcgamma receptors. Enriched preparations of retrovectors containing this chimeric receptor and the GFP gene could stably and efficiently transduce human PBL co-activated by anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 antibodies. In routine experiments, the transgene was expressed in 35-70% of the human T cells. Such lymphocytes express the chimeric receptors on their surface and upon stimulation with hapten immobilized on plastic they can produce IL-2. Transfectomas activated in this manner also undergo specific proliferation in the absence of exogenous IL-2. Moreover, the transduced lymphocytes could effectively lyse target cells expressing the TNP hapten on their surface. These studies establish the conditions for the optimal transfection of effector lymphocytes to redirect them against a variety of tumor targets.","['Eshhar, Z', 'Waks, T', 'Bendavid, A', 'Schindler, D G']","['Eshhar Z', 'Waks T', 'Bendavid A', 'Schindler DG']","['Department of Immunology, The Weizmann Institute of Science, 76100, Rehovot, Israel. zelig.eshhar@weizmann.ac.il']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",Netherlands,J Immunol Methods,Journal of immunological methods,1305440,"['0 (CD28 Antigens)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Variable Region)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Luminescent Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, IgG)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Trinitrobenzenes)', '147336-22-9 (Green Fluorescent Proteins)']",IM,"['CD28 Antigens/genetics', 'Genetic Vectors', 'Green Fluorescent Proteins', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Variable Region', 'Interleukin-2/pharmacology', 'Luminescent Proteins/genetics', 'Receptors, IgG/*genetics', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/*genetics', 'Retroviridae/genetics', 'T-Lymphocytes/*metabolism', 'Transfection', 'Trinitrobenzenes/immunology']",,2001/02/27 10:00,2001/04/06 10:01,['2001/02/27 10:00'],"['2001/02/27 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/04/06 10:01 [medline]', '2001/02/27 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Immunol Methods. 2001 Feb 1;248(1-2):67-76. doi: 10.1016/s0022-1759(00)00343-4.,,,"['S0022175900003434 [pii]', '10.1016/s0022-1759(00)00343-4 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

They cause various toxic effects in animals and in exposed human populations. The mechanisms of toxicity, however, are not completely understood. PCBs are metabolized by cytochromes P450 to mono- and dihydroxylated compounds. Dihydroxy-PCBs can potentially be oxidized to the corresponding quinones. We hypothesized that reactive oxygen species (ROS) are produced by redox reactions of PCB metabolites. We tested several synthetic dihydroxy- and quinoid-PCBs with 1-3 chlorines for their potential to produce ROS in vitro and in HL-60 human leukemia cells, and DNA strand breaks in vitro. All dihydroxy-PCBs tested produced superoxide. The quinones generated superoxide only in the presence of GSH, probably during the autoxidation of the glutathione conjugates. We observed increased superoxide production with decreasing halogenation. Incubation of dihydroxy-PCBs or PCB quinones + GSH with plasmid DNA resulted in DNA strand break induction in the presence of Cu(II). Tests with various ROS scavengers indicated that hydroxyl radicals and singlet oxygen are likely involved in this strand break induction. Finally, dihydroxy- and quinoid PCBs also produced ROS in HL-60 cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner. We conclude that dihydroxylated PCBs, and PCB quinones after reaction with GSH, produce superoxide and other ROS both in vitro and in HL-60 cells, and oxidative DNA damage in the form of DNA strand breaks in vitro. The reactions seen in vitro and in cells may well be a predictor of the toxicity of PCBs in animals.","['Srinivasan, A', 'Lehmler, H J', 'Robertson, L W', 'Ludewig, G']","['Srinivasan A', 'Lehmler HJ', 'Robertson LW', 'Ludewig G']","['Graduate Center for Toxicology, 306 Health Sciences Research Building, University of Kentucky Medical Center, Lexington, Kentucky 40536-0305, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Toxicol Sci,Toxicological sciences : an official journal of the Society of Toxicology,9805461,"['0 (Environmental Pollutants)', '0 (Hydroquinones)', '0 (Quinones)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', 'DFC2HB4I0K (Polychlorinated Biphenyls)']",IM,"['Cell Survival/drug effects', 'DNA Damage/*drug effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Environmental Pollutants/metabolism/*toxicity', 'HL-60 Cells/cytology/*drug effects/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Hydroquinones/metabolism/toxicity', 'Oxidation-Reduction', 'Polychlorinated Biphenyls/metabolism/*toxicity', 'Quinones/metabolism/toxicity', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/*metabolism']",,2001/02/27 10:00,2001/05/22 10:01,['2001/02/27 10:00'],"['2001/02/27 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/05/22 10:01 [medline]', '2001/02/27 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Toxicol Sci. 2001 Mar;60(1):92-102. doi: 10.1093/toxsci/60.1.92.,,,['10.1093/toxsci/60.1.92 [doi]'],,['P42 ES 07380/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,

Previous studies have identified two important RNA signals for frameshifting, the slippery sequence and a downstream stem-loop structure. However, there have been somewhat conflicting reports concerning the individual contributions of these sequences. In this study we have performed a comprehensive mutational analysis of the cis-acting RNA sequences involved in HIV-1 gag-pol and HTLV-2 gag-pro frameshifting. Using an in vitro translation system we determined frameshifting efficiencies for shuffled HIV-1/HTLV-2 RNA elements in a background of HIV-1 or HTLV-2 sequences. We show that the ability of the slippery sequence and stem-loop to promote ribosomal frameshifting is influenced by the flanking upstream sequence and the nucleotides in the spacer element. A wide range of frameshift efficiency rates was observed for both viruses when shuffling single sequence elements. The results for HIV-1/HTLV-2 chimeric constructs represent strong evidence supporting the notion that the viral wild-type sequences are not designed for maximal frameshifting activity but are optimized to a level suited to efficient viral replication.","['Kim, Y G', 'Maas, S', 'Rich, A']","['Kim YG', 'Maas S', 'Rich A']","['Department of Biology, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, 77 Massachusetts Avenue, MA 02139, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Nucleic Acids Res,Nucleic acids research,0411011,"['0 (Luminescent Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Viral)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '147336-22-9 (Green Fluorescent Proteins)', 'EC 2.5.1.18 (Glutathione Transferase)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Frameshifting, Ribosomal/*genetics', 'Glutathione Transferase/genetics/metabolism', 'Green Fluorescent Proteins', 'HIV-1/*genetics', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 2/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Luminescent Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Mutation', 'Nucleic Acid Conformation', 'Protein Biosynthesis', 'RNA, Viral/chemistry/genetics/*physiology', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction']",,2001/02/27 10:00,2001/05/22 10:01,['2001/02/27 10:00'],"['2001/02/27 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/05/22 10:01 [medline]', '2001/02/27 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Nucleic Acids Res. 2001 Mar 1;29(5):1125-31. doi: 10.1093/nar/29.5.1125.,,,['10.1093/nar/29.5.1125 [doi]'],PMC29715,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In immunocompetent adults, these molecules induce prominent inflammatory infiltrates. However, with immunosuppressive retroviruses, such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), little CNS inflammation is observed yet proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines are still upregulated in some patients and may mediate pathogenesis. The present study examined expression of cytokines and chemokines in brain tissue of neonatal mice infected with virulent (Fr98) and avirulent (Fr54) polytropic murine retroviruses. While both viruses infect microglia and endothelia primarily in the white matter areas of the CNS, only Fr98 induces clinical CNS disease. The pathology consists of gliosis with minimal morphological changes and no inflammation, similar to HIV. In the present experiments, mice infected with Fr98 had increased cerebellar mRNA levels of proinflammatory cytokines tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), TNF-beta, and interleukin-1 alpha and chemokines macrophage inflammatory protein-1 alpha (MIP-1 alpha), MIP-1 beta, monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP-1), gamma-interferon-inducible protein 10 (IP-10), and RANTES compared to mice infected with Fr54 or mock-infected controls. The increased expression of these genes occurred prior to the development of clinical symptoms, suggesting that these cytokines and chemokines might be involved in induction of neuropathogenesis. Two separate regions of the Fr98 envelope gene are associated with neurovirulence. CNS disease associated with the N-terminal portion of the Fr98 env gene was preceded by upregulation of cytokines and chemokines. In contrast, disease associated with the central region of the Fr98 env gene showed no upregulation of cytokines or chemokines and thus did not require increased expression of these genes for disease induction.","['Peterson, K E', 'Robertson, S J', 'Portis, J L', 'Chesebro, B']","['Peterson KE', 'Robertson SJ', 'Portis JL', 'Chesebro B']","['Laboratory of Persistent Viral Diseases, Rocky Mountain Laboratories, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Hamilton, Montana 59840, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Chemokines)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Brain/metabolism/pathology/virology', 'Central Nervous System Viral Diseases/immunology/*virology', 'Chemokines/*metabolism', 'Cytokines/*metabolism', '*Genes, env', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/genetics/immunology/*pathogenicity', 'Leukemia, Experimental/immunology/virology', 'Mice', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Retroviridae Infections/immunology/*virology', 'Tumor Virus Infections/immunology/virology', 'Viral Envelope Proteins/genetics']",,2001/02/27 10:00,2001/04/06 10:01,['2001/02/27 10:00'],"['2001/02/27 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/04/06 10:01 [medline]', '2001/02/27 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Virol. 2001 Mar;75(6):2848-56. doi: 10.1128/JVI.75.6.2848-2856.2001.,,,['10.1128/JVI.75.6.2848-2856.2001 [doi]'],PMC115911,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We show that purified endothelial cells express LIF mRNA and that their ability to induce astrocyte differentiation is prevented by a neutralizing anti-LIF, but not anti-ciliary neurotrophic factor, antiserum. These findings demonstrate a role for endothelial cells in inducing astrocyte differentiation. The induction of astrocyte differentiation by endothelial cells makes sense phylogenetically, anatomically, and functionally, because astrocytes evolved concurrently with brain vasculature and ensheathe capillaries throughout the brain. The ability to purify and culture astrocytes and endothelial cells should provide an excellent model system for future studies of blood-brain barrier development.","['Mi, H', 'Haeberle, H', 'Barres, B A']","['Mi H', 'Haeberle H', 'Barres BA']","['Stanford University School of Medicine, Department of Neurobiology, Stanford, California 94305-5125, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Neurosci,The Journal of neuroscience : the official journal of the Society for Neuroscience,8102140,"['0 (Antibodies)', '0 (Ciliary Neurotrophic Factor)', '0 (Coloring Agents)', '0 (Glial Fibrillary Acidic Protein)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (von Willebrand Factor)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies/pharmacology', 'Astrocytes/*cytology', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects/physiology', 'Cell Separation', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Ciliary Neurotrophic Factor/antagonists & inhibitors/biosynthesis/pharmacology', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Coloring Agents', 'Endothelium, Vascular/*cytology/metabolism', 'Glial Fibrillary Acidic Protein/metabolism', 'Growth Inhibitors/antagonists & inhibitors/biosynthesis/genetics/pharmacology', '*Interleukin-6', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Lymphokines/antagonists & inhibitors/biosynthesis/genetics/pharmacology', 'Optic Nerve/blood supply/cytology/embryology', 'Pia Mater/cytology', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis', 'Rats', 'Rats, Sprague-Dawley', 'Stem Cells/cytology/drug effects', 'von Willebrand Factor/metabolism']",,2001/02/27 10:00,2001/04/06 10:01,['2001/02/27 10:00'],"['2001/02/27 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/04/06 10:01 [medline]', '2001/02/27 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Neurosci. 2001 Mar 1;21(5):1538-47.,,,['21/5/1538 [pii]'],PMC6762957,"['R01 EY010257/EY/NEI NIH HHS/United States', 'R29 EY010257/EY/NEI NIH HHS/United States', 'EY10257/EY/NEI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,

An early phase of vasculitis in the model occurs within 24 h of an injection of HgCl2, is alphabeta T cell independent and involves the mast cell. In addition, HgCl2 induces IL-4 mRNA in mast cells from BN rats. Our recent work has demonstrated that the balance of oxidative/antioxidative influences plays an important role in the modulation of mast cell function (degranulation) in chemically induced autoimmunity. The aim of this study was to determine, in mast cells, whether oxidative status influences IL-4 transcription and translation, which is required for the development of a T(h)2 response. Exposure of the mast cell line RBL-2H3 to HgCl2 enhanced both IL-4 mRNA and its promoter activity. Oxidative stress by hydrogen peroxide mimicked the effects of HgCl2 in enhancing IL-4 promoter activity. The enhancement of IL-4 gene expression by HgCl2 was significantly reduced by antioxidants (both sulphydryl and non-sulphydryl containing). The same pattern of regulation was also observed on IL-4 protein expression in the mast cells. These data suggest a novel mechanism of IL-4 transcriptional up-regulation by oxidative stress. Our results provide evidence to support our hypothesis that alterations in intracellular reactive oxygen species production modulate both IL-4 gene expression and mast cell function.","['Wu, Z', 'Turner, D R', 'Oliveira, D B']","['Wu Z', 'Turner DR', 'Oliveira DB']","[""Division of Renal Medicine, St George's Hospital Medical School, Cranmer Terrace, London SW17 0RE, UK.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Int Immunol,International immunology,8916182,"['0 (Antioxidants)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '207137-56-2 (Interleukin-4)', '53GH7MZT1R (Mercuric Chloride)', 'BBX060AN9V (Hydrogen Peroxide)', 'GAN16C9B8O (Glutathione)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antioxidants/pharmacology', 'Autoimmunity', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Gene Expression Regulation/*drug effects', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/drug effects', 'Glutathione/pharmacology', 'Hydrogen Peroxide/pharmacology', 'Interleukin-4/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Leukemia, Basophilic, Acute/pathology', 'Mast Cells/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Mercuric Chloride/*pharmacology', 'Neoplasm Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Oxidative Stress', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Rats', 'Rats, Inbred BN', 'Reactive Oxygen Species', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Spleen/cytology', 'Th2 Cells/immunology', 'Transcription, Genetic/*drug effects', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects']",,2001/02/27 10:00,2001/06/08 10:01,['2001/02/27 10:00'],"['2001/02/27 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/06/08 10:01 [medline]', '2001/02/27 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Int Immunol. 2001 Mar;13(3):297-304. doi: 10.1093/intimm/13.3.297.,,,['10.1093/intimm/13.3.297 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Signaling pathways activated through CD40 in monocytes/macrophages have not been characterized as well as in B cells. Using human monocytes and the human monocytic cell line THP1, we examined signal transduction events induced by CD40 engagement with its ligand, CD154. In human monocytes, all TRAF mRNAs were expressed constitutively and CD40 ligation resulted in a strong up-regulation of TRAF1 mRNA. In THP1 cells, CD40 ligation induced expression of TRAF1 and TRAF5 mRNAs. Engagement of CD40 in both monocytes and THP1 cells led to the rapid and transient activation of the extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK) 1 and 2, and to low levels of JNK activation. No CD40-dependent activation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) was found. In CD154-stimulated monocytes and THP1 cells the upstream ERK1/2 activator, MAPK kinase (MEK) 1/2, and downstream substrate, c-Myc, were activated. By blocking activation of ERK1/2 with a MEK-specific inhibitor, PD98059, CD40-dependent secretion of the pro-inflammatory cytokines, TNF-alpha, IL-6 and IL-8, was demonstrated to be linked to the ERK1/2 pathway. The ERK1/2 pathway did not appear to be involved in up-regulating TRAF1 and TRAF5 mRNAs in THP1 cells. Collectively, these results suggest distinct differences between B cells and monocytic cells in CD40-dependent activation of MAPK pathways.","['Pearson, L L', 'Castle, B E', 'Kehry, M R']","['Pearson LL', 'Castle BE', 'Kehry MR']","['Department of Biology, R6-5, Boehringer Ingelheim Pharmaceuticals, Inc., 900 Ridgebury Road/PO Box 368, Ridgefield, CT 06877, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",England,Int Immunol,International immunology,8916182,"['0 (CD40 Antigens)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Flavonoids)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Interleukin-8)', '0 (Macromolecular Substances)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (TNF Receptor-Associated Factor 1)', '0 (TNF Receptor-Associated Factor 2)', '0 (TNF Receptor-Associated Factor 3)', '0 (TNF Receptor-Associated Factor 4)', '0 (TNF Receptor-Associated Factor 5)', '0 (TNF Receptor-Associated Factor 6)', '0 (TRAF4 protein, human)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor Receptor-Associated Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '147205-72-9 (CD40 Ligand)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 3)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 8)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.25 (MAP Kinase Kinase Kinase 1)', 'EC 2.7.11.25 (MAP3K1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.12.2 (MAP Kinase Kinase 1)', 'EC 2.7.12.2 (MAP2K1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.12.2 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinases)', 'SJE1IO5E3I (2-(2-amino-3-methoxyphenyl)-4H-1-benzopyran-4-one)']",IM,"['B-Lymphocytes/metabolism', 'CD40 Antigens/*immunology', 'CD40 Ligand/*immunology', 'Carrier Proteins/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Flavonoids/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-6/metabolism', 'Interleukin-8/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Monocytic, Acute/pathology', 'MAP Kinase Kinase 1', '*MAP Kinase Kinase Kinase 1', 'MAP Kinase Signaling System/*drug effects', 'Macromolecular Substances', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1/metabolism', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 3', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 8', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/metabolism', 'Monocytes/*immunology', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Protein Biosynthesis', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Proteins/genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc/metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'TNF Receptor-Associated Factor 1', 'TNF Receptor-Associated Factor 2', 'TNF Receptor-Associated Factor 3', 'TNF Receptor-Associated Factor 4', 'TNF Receptor-Associated Factor 5', 'TNF Receptor-Associated Factor 6', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor Receptor-Associated Peptides and Proteins', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/metabolism', 'p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases']",,2001/02/27 10:00,2001/06/08 10:01,['2001/02/27 10:00'],"['2001/02/27 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/06/08 10:01 [medline]', '2001/02/27 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Int Immunol. 2001 Mar;13(3):273-83. doi: 10.1093/intimm/13.3.273.,,,['10.1093/intimm/13.3.273 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Mice were then challenged with AML cells. The total number of splenic anti-AML cytotoxic T-lymphocyte precursors (CTLPs) present at the time of challenge was increased 1.9-fold and 16.4-fold by Flt3L or DC tumor vaccines, respectively. As compared with the 0% survival of controls, 63% or more of recipients of pulsed DCs or Flt3L survived long term. Mice given AML cells prior to DC vaccines or Flt3L had only a slight survival advantage versus non-treated controls. NK cells or NK cells and T cells were found to be involved in the antitumor responses of Flt3L or DCs, respectively. DC vaccines lead to long-term memory responses but Flt3L does not. Syngeneic bone marrow transplantation (BMT) recipients were analyzed beginning 2 months post-BMT. In contrast to the uniform lethality in BMT controls given AML cells, recipients of either Flt3L or DC vaccines had a significant increase in survival. The total number of splenic anti-AML CTLPs at the time of AML challenge in BMT controls was 40% of concurrently analyzed non-BMT controls. Flt3L or DC vaccines increased the total anti-AML CTLPs 1.4-fold and 6.8-fold, respectively. Neither approach was successful when initiated after AML challenge. It was concluded that DC vaccines and Flt3L administration can enhance an AML response in non-transplanted or syngeneic BMT mice but only when initiated prior to AML progression.","['Pawlowska, A B', 'Hashino, S', 'McKenna, H', 'Weigel, B J', 'Taylor, P A', 'Blazar, B R']","['Pawlowska AB', 'Hashino S', 'McKenna H', 'Weigel BJ', 'Taylor PA', 'Blazar BR']","['University of Minnesota Cancer Center and Department of Pediatrics, Division of Bone Marrow Transplantation, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN 55455, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Adjuvants, Immunologic)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (flt3 ligand protein)']",IM,"['Adjuvants, Immunologic/administration & dosage/pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Antibody Formation/radiation effects', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Dendritic Cells/drug effects/immunology/*transplantation', 'Hematopoiesis/drug effects', '*Immunotherapy, Adoptive', 'Killer Cells, Natural/immunology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/prevention & control/*therapy', 'Membrane Proteins/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Transplantation, Isogeneic', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/transplantation']",,2001/02/27 10:00,2001/04/21 10:01,['2001/02/27 10:00'],"['2001/02/27 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/04/21 10:01 [medline]', '2001/02/27 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 2001 Mar 1;97(5):1474-82. doi: 10.1182/blood.v97.5.1474.,,,"['10.1182/blood.v97.5.1474 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)56272-1 [pii]']",,"['R01 CA72669/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 CA71340/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Expression of the product of the Ph chromosome, the BCR/ABL oncogene, in mice by retroviral bone marrow transduction and transplantation induces CML-like leukemia, and some leukemic mice have increased circulating IL-3, and perhaps granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF). These observations raise the possibility of autocrine or paracrine cytokine production in the pathogenesis of human CML. Mice with homozygous inactivation of the Il-3 gene, the Gm-csf gene, or both, were used to test the requirement for these cytokines for induction of CML-like disease by BCR/ABL. Neither IL-3 nor GM-CSF was required in donor, recipient, or both for induction of CML-like leukemia by p210 BCR/ABL. Use of novel mice deficient in both IL-3 and GM-CSF demonstrated that the lack of effect on leukemogenesis was not due to redundancy between these hematopoietic growth factors. Analysis of cytokine levels in leukemic mice where either donor or recipient was Il-3(-/-) indicated that the increased IL-3 originated from the recipient, suggestive of a host reaction to the disease. These results demonstrate that IL-3 and GM-CSF are not required for BCR/ABL-induced CML-like leukemia in mice and suggest that autocrine production of IL-3 does not play a role in established chronic phase CML in humans.","['Li, S', 'Gillessen, S', 'Tomasson, M H', 'Dranoff, G', 'Gilliland, D G', 'Van Etten, R A']","['Li S', 'Gillessen S', 'Tomasson MH', 'Dranoff G', 'Gilliland DG', 'Van Etten RA']","['The Center for Blood Research, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, and Harvard Institutes of Medicine and Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Interleukin-3)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/*drug effects', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/genetics/*pharmacology', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/genetics/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Interleukin-3/genetics/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*etiology/metabolism/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/etiology/metabolism/pathology', 'Survival Rate', 'Tissue Distribution', 'Transduction, Genetic']",,2001/02/27 10:00,2001/04/21 10:01,['2001/02/27 10:00'],"['2001/02/27 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/04/21 10:01 [medline]', '2001/02/27 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 2001 Mar 1;97(5):1442-50. doi: 10.1182/blood.v97.5.1442.,,,"['10.1182/blood.v97.5.1442 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)56268-X [pii]']",,"['CA39542/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA57593/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA66996/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA74886/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA81197/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'DK50654/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Evidence that leukemic transformation may be, at least in part, cytokine dependent includes data from primary human leukemia cells, cell culture experiments, and murine models of leukemia. This report demonstrates that interleukin (IL)-3 plasma levels are elevated in myeloproliferative disease (MPD) caused by the TEL/tyrosine kinase fusions TEL/platelet-derived growth factor beta receptor (PDGFbetaR), TEL/Janus kinase 2 (JAK2), and TEL/neurotrophin-3 receptor (TRKC).

Furthermore, in experiments using normal marrow transduced with TEL/PDGFbetaR retrovirus mixed with marrow transduced with an enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) retrovirus, the MPD induced in these mice demonstrated minimal stimulation of normal myelopoiesis by the TEL/PDGFbetaR-expressing cells. In contrast, recipients of mixed GM-CSF-transduced and EGFP-transduced marrow exhibited significant paracrine expansion of EGFP-expressing cells.

To delineate the potential role of VEGF in patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), VEGF protein and receptor expression and its functional significance in MDS bone marrow (BM) were evaluated. In BM clot sections from normal donors, low-intensity cytoplasmic VEGF expression was detected infrequently in isolated myeloid elements. However, monocytoid precursors in chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) expressed VEGF in an intense cytoplasmic pattern with membranous co-expression of the Flt-1 or KDR receptors, or both. In situ hybridization confirmed the presence of VEGF mRNA in the neoplastic monocytes. In acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) and other MDS subtypes, intense co-expression of VEGF and one or both receptors was detected in myeloblasts and immature myeloid elements, whereas erythroid precursors and lymphoid cells lacked VEGF and receptor expression. Foci of abnormal localized immature myeloid precursors (ALIP) co-expressed VEGF and Flt-1 receptor, suggesting autocrine cytokine interaction. Antibody neutralization of VEGF inhibited colony-forming unit (CFU)-leukemia formation in 9 of 15 CMML and RAEB-t patient specimens, whereas VEGF stimulated leukemia colony formation in 12 patients. Neutralization of VEGF activity suppressed the generation of tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interleukin-1beta from MDS BM-mononuclear cells and BM-stroma and promoted the formation of CFU-GEMM and burst-forming unit-erythroid in methylcellulose cultures. These findings indicate that autocrine production of VEGF may contribute to leukemia progenitor self-renewal and inflammatory cytokine elaboration in CMML and MDS and thus provide a biologic rationale for ALIP and its adverse prognostic relevance in high-risk MDS.","['Bellamy, W T', 'Richter, L', 'Sirjani, D', 'Roxas, C', 'Glinsmann-Gibson, B', 'Frutiger, Y', 'Grogan, T M', 'List, A F']","['Bellamy WT', 'Richter L', 'Sirjani D', 'Roxas C', 'Glinsmann-Gibson B', 'Frutiger Y', 'Grogan TM', 'List AF']","['Department of Pathology, and the Bone Marrow Transplant Program, The Arizona Cancer Center, University of Arizona, Tucson, AZ 85724, USA. wbellamy@u.arizona.edu']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Endothelial Growth Factors)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Receptors, Growth Factor)', '0 (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A)', '0 (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factors)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptors, Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/pharmacology', 'Autocrine Communication', 'Bone Marrow Cells/chemistry/pathology', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/*drug effects/metabolism/pathology', 'Cytokines/drug effects', 'Endothelial Growth Factors/immunology/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Lymphokines/immunology/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*etiology/metabolism/pathology', 'Myeloid Progenitor Cells/*drug effects/pathology', 'Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/metabolism', 'Receptors, Growth Factor/metabolism', 'Receptors, Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor', 'Stem Cells/drug effects', 'Stromal Cells/chemistry/pathology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factors']",,2001/02/27 10:00,2001/04/21 10:01,['2001/02/27 10:00'],"['2001/02/27 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/04/21 10:01 [medline]', '2001/02/27 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 2001 Mar 1;97(5):1427-34. doi: 10.1182/blood.v97.5.1427.,,,"['10.1182/blood.v97.5.1427 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)56266-6 [pii]']",,"['CA-32102/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'ESO6694/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States']",,['Blood. 2001 Aug 15;98(4):1272-3.

A cysteine-to-threonine (C --> T) substitution polymorphism at nucleotide 609 of the NQO1 complementary DNA (NQO1 C609T) results in a lowering of NQO1 activity. Individuals homozygous for this mutation have no NQO1 activity, and heterozygotes have low to intermediate activity compared with people with wild type. DNA samples from 493 adult de novo acute leukemia patients and 838 matched controls were genotyped for NQO1 C609T. The majority of cases were diagnosed as acute myeloid leukemia (AML) (n = 420); 67 as acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL); and 6 as other forms of acute leukemia. The frequency of cases with low or null NQO1 activity (heterozygote + homozygous mutant) was significantly higher among total acute leukemia case subjects compared with their matched controls (odds ratio [OR] = 1.49; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.17-1.89).

The stem cell factor (SCF) receptor, c-kit, is structurally related to these receptors and, although not expressed on mature peripheral blood cells, is expressed in leukemic blasts derived from 60% to 80% of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients. The c-kit kinase inhibitory activity of SU5416 and SU6668 was evaluated in MO7E cells, a human myeloid leukemia cell line. Tyrosine autophosphorylation of the receptor, induced by SCF, was inhibited in these cells by SU5416 and SU6668 in a dose-dependent manner (inhibitory concentration of 50% [IC(50)] 0.1-1 microM). Inhibition of extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) phosphorylation, a signaling event downstream of c-kit activation, was also inhibited in a dose-dependent manner. Both compounds also inhibited SCF-induced proliferation of MO7E cells (IC(50) 0.1 microM for SU5416; 0.29 microM for SU6668). Furthermore, both SU5416 and SU6668 induced apoptosis in a dose- and time-dependent manner as measured by the increase in activated caspase-3 and the enhanced cleavage of its substrate poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase. These findings with MO7E cells were extended to leukemic blasts from c-kit(+) patients. In patient blasts, both SU5416 and SU6668 inhibited SCF-induced phosphorylation of c-kit and ERK1/2 and induced apoptosis. These studies indicate that SU5416 and SU6668 inhibit biologic functions of c-kit in addition to exhibiting antiangiogenic properties and suggest that the combination of these activities may provide a novel therapeutic approach for the treatment of AML.","['Smolich, B D', 'Yuen, H A', 'West, K A', 'Giles, F J', 'Albitar, M', 'Cherrington, J M']","['Smolich BD', 'Yuen HA', 'West KA', 'Giles FJ', 'Albitar M', 'Cherrington JM']","['Preclinical Therapeutics, Sugen, South San Francisco, CA 94080, USA. beverly-smolich@sugen.com']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Angiogenesis Inhibitors)', '0 (Indoles)', '0 (Oxindoles)', '0 (Propionates)', '0 (Pyrroles)', '0 (Stem Cell Factor)', '71IA9S35AJ (Semaxinib)', '9RL37ZZ665 (orantinib)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",IM,"['Angiogenesis Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Caspase 3', 'Caspases/drug effects/metabolism', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Humans', 'Indoles/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/drug therapy/*pathology', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Oxindoles', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Propionates', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit/*drug effects', 'Pyrroles/pharmacology', 'Stem Cell Factor/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects']",,2001/02/27 10:00,2001/04/21 10:01,['2001/02/27 10:00'],"['2001/02/27 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/04/21 10:01 [medline]', '2001/02/27 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 2001 Mar 1;97(5):1413-21. doi: 10.1182/blood.v97.5.1413.,,,"['10.1182/blood.v97.5.1413 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)56264-2 [pii]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Farnesyl protein transferase inhibitors (FTIs) were designed to block mutant Ras signaling, but they also inhibit the growth of transformed cells with wild-type Ras, implying that other farnesylated targets contribute to FTI action. In the current study, the clinical candidate FTI SCH66336 was characterized for its ability to inhibit BCR/ABL transformation. When tested against BCR/ABL-BaF3 cells, a murine cell line that is leukemogenic in mice, SCH66336 potently inhibited soft agar colony formation, slowed proliferation, and sensitized cells to apoptotic stimuli. Quantification of activated guanosine triphosphate (GTP)-bound Ras protein and electrophoretic mobility shift assays for AP-1 DNA binding showed that Ras effector pathways are inhibited by SCH66336. However, SCH66336 was more inhibitory than dominant-negative Ras in assays of soft agar colony formation and cell proliferation, suggesting activity against targets other than Ras. Cell cycle analysis of BCR/ABL-BaF3 cells treated with SCH66336 revealed G2/M blockade, consistent with recent reports that centromeric proteins that regulate the G2/M checkpoint are critical farnesylated targets of FTI action. Mice injected intravenously with BCR/ABL-BaF3 cells developed acute leukemia and died within 4 weeks with massive splenomegaly, elevated white blood cell counts, and anemia. In contrast, nearly all mice treated with SCH66336 survived and have remained disease-free for more than a year. Furthermore, SCH66336 selectively inhibited the hematopoietic colony formation of primary human CML cells. As an oral, nontoxic compound with a mechanism of action distinct from that of ABL tyrosine kinase inhibition, FTI SCH66336 shows promise for the treatment of BCR/ABL-induced leukemia.","['Peters, D G', 'Hoover, R R', 'Gerlach, M J', 'Koh, E Y', 'Zhang, H', 'Choe, K', 'Kirschmeier, P', 'Bishop, W R', 'Daley, G Q']","['Peters DG', 'Hoover RR', 'Gerlach MJ', 'Koh EY', 'Zhang H', 'Choe K', 'Kirschmeier P', 'Bishop WR', 'Daley GQ']","['Whitehead Institute, Cambridge, MA; Division of Hematology/ Oncology, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA 02142, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Piperidines)', '0 (Pyridines)', 'EC 2.5.- (Alkyl and Aryl Transferases)', 'EC 2.5.1.29 (Farnesyltranstransferase)', 'IOW153004F (lonafarnib)']",IM,"['Alkyl and Aryl Transferases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Bone Marrow Cells/drug effects/pathology', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Farnesyltranstransferase', 'Genes, abl/physiology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Experimental/drug therapy/pathology', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/genetics', 'Mice', '*Piperidines/*pharmacology', '*Pyridines/*pharmacology', 'Spleen/drug effects/pathology', 'Survival Rate', 'Transformation, Genetic', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,2001/02/27 10:00,2001/04/21 10:01,['2001/02/27 10:00'],"['2001/02/27 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/04/21 10:01 [medline]', '2001/02/27 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 2001 Mar 1;97(5):1404-12. doi: 10.1182/blood.v97.5.1404.,,,"['10.1182/blood.v97.5.1404 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)56263-0 [pii]']",,['CA476418-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,

The prognosis for this class of patients is poor, and no standard chemotherapy combination so far has demonstrated long-term efficacy. The Ph-translocation joins the BCR and ABL genes and leads to expression of a chimeric Bcr/Abl protein with enhanced tyrosine kinase activity. This increase in activity leads to malignant transformation by interference with basic cellular functions such as the control of proliferation, adherence to stroma and extracellular matrix, and apoptosis. One important pathway activated by Bcr/Abl is the Ras pathway. Ras proteins have to undergo a series of posttranslational modifications to become biologically active. The first modification is the farnesylation of the C-terminus catalyzed by farnesyl transferase. We studied the effect of the farnesyl transferase inhibitor SCH66336 in an in vivo murine model of Bcr/Abl-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia. In the early leukemic phase, mice were randomly assigned to a treatment, a vehicle, and a nontreatment group. The treatment was well tolerated without any detectable side effects. All animals of the control groups died of leukemia/lymphoma within 103 days (range, 18-103 days). In contrast, 80% of the drug-receiving group survived without any signs of leukemia or lymphoma until termination of treatment, after a median treatment period of 200 days (range, 179-232 days).

This study was performed because the CD95/Fas receptor-ligand interaction, recruitment of the Fas-associated death domain (FADD) adaptor protein, and subsequent activation of procaspase-8 have been implicated in the execution of drug-induced apoptosis in other cell types. Indeed, active caspase-8 was readily detected after treatment of mature and immature B-lymphoid cells with epirubicin or Taxol. However, neither constitutive nor drug-induced expression of the CD95/Fas ligand was detectable in B-lymphoma cells. Furthermore, overexpression of a dominant-negative FADD mutant (FADDdn) did not block caspase-8 processing and subsequent DNA fragmentation, indicating that drug-induced caspase-8 activation was mediated by a CD95/Fas-independent mechanism. Instead, caspase-8 cleavage was slightly preceded by activation of caspase-3, suggesting that drug-induced caspase-8 activation in B-lymphoma cells is a downstream event mediated by other caspases. This assumption was confirmed in 2 experimental systems-zDEVD-fmk, a cell-permeable inhibitor of caspase-3-like activity, blocked drug-induced caspase-8 cleavage, and depletion of caspase-3 from cell extracts impaired caspase-8 cleavage after in vitro activation with dATP and cytochrome c. Thus, these data indicate that drug-induced caspase-8 activation in B-lymphoma cells is independent of death receptor signaling and is mediated by postmitochondrial caspase-3 activation.","['Wieder, T', 'Essmann, F', 'Prokop, A', 'Schmelz, K', 'Schulze-Osthoff, K', 'Beyaert, R', 'Dorken, B', 'Daniel, P T']","['Wieder T', 'Essmann F', 'Prokop A', 'Schmelz K', 'Schulze-Osthoff K', 'Beyaert R', 'Dorken B', 'Daniel PT']","['Department of Hematology, Oncology and Tumor Immunology, University Medical Center Charite, Humboldt University of Berlin, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (FADD protein, human)', '0 (FASLG protein, human)', '0 (Fas Ligand Protein)', '0 (Fas-Associated Death Domain Protein)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (fas Receptor)', '3Z8479ZZ5X (Epirubicin)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP8 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP9 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 8)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 9)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'P88XT4IS4D (Paclitaxel)']",IM,"['*Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Carrier Proteins/genetics/pharmacology', 'Caspase 3', 'Caspase 8', 'Caspase 9', 'Caspases/metabolism/*pharmacology/physiology', 'Child', 'Epirubicin/pharmacology', 'Fas Ligand Protein', 'Fas-Associated Death Domain Protein', 'Humans', 'Immunoblotting', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/*pathology', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/*metabolism/physiology', 'Paclitaxel/pharmacology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'fas Receptor/*metabolism/pharmacology/physiology']",,2001/02/27 10:00,2001/04/21 10:01,['2001/02/27 10:00'],"['2001/02/27 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/04/21 10:01 [medline]', '2001/02/27 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 2001 Mar 1;97(5):1378-87. doi: 10.1182/blood.v97.5.1378.,,,"['10.1182/blood.v97.5.1378 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)56259-9 [pii]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Whether these translocations relate to a role for endogenous RARalpha in normal granulopoiesis remains uncertain because most studies addressing this question have used non-physiological overexpression systems. Granulocyte differentiation in cells derived from RARalpha-deficient (RARalpha(-/-)) mice was studied and evaluated in the context of agonist-bound and ligand-free RARalpha. Our results demonstrate that RARalpha is dispensable for granulopoiesis, as RARalpha(-/-) mice have a normal granulocyte population despite an impaired ability to respond to retinoids. However, although it is not absolutely required, RARalpha can bidirectionally modulate granulopoiesis. RARalpha stimulates differentiation in response to exogenous retinoic acid. Furthermore, endogenous retinoids control granulopoiesis in vivo, as either vitamin A-deficient mice or animals treated with an RAR antagonist accumulate more immature granulocytes in their bone marrow. Conversely, RARalpha acts to limit differentiation in the absence of ligand because granulocyte precursors from RARalpha(-/-) mice differentiate earlier in culture. Thus, the block in granulopoiesis exerted by RARalpha fusion proteins expressed in APL cells may correspond to an amplification of a normal function of unliganded RARalpha.","['Kastner, P', 'Lawrence, H J', 'Waltzinger, C', 'Ghyselinck, N B', 'Chambon, P', 'Chan, S']","['Kastner P', 'Lawrence HJ', 'Waltzinger C', 'Ghyselinck NB', 'Chambon P', 'Chan S']","['Institut de Genetique et de Biologie Moleculaire et Cellulaire, Illkirch, France. scpk@igbmc.u-strasbg.fr']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Rara protein, mouse)', '0 (Receptors, Retinoic Acid)', '0 (Retinoic Acid Receptor alpha)', '0 (Retinoids)', '0 (Retinol-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Retinol-Binding Proteins, Cellular)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Bone Marrow Cells', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Granulocytes/*cytology/*drug effects', 'Mice', 'Mice, Mutant Strains', 'Receptors, Retinoic Acid/genetics/metabolism/*physiology', 'Retinoic Acid Receptor alpha', 'Retinoids/pharmacology', 'Retinol-Binding Proteins/genetics/pharmacology', 'Retinol-Binding Proteins, Cellular', 'Tretinoin/pharmacology', 'Vitamin A Deficiency']",,2001/02/27 10:00,2001/04/21 10:01,['2001/02/27 10:00'],"['2001/02/27 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/04/21 10:01 [medline]', '2001/02/27 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 2001 Mar 1;97(5):1314-20. doi: 10.1182/blood.v97.5.1314.,,,"['10.1182/blood.v97.5.1314 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)56251-4 [pii]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Compared with prior protocols, post-remission therapy was intensified by substituting dexamethasone for prednisone and prolonging the asparaginase intensification from 20 to 30 weeks. Between 1991 and 1995, 377 patients (age, 0-18 years) were enrolled; 137 patients were considered standard risk (SR), and 240 patients were high risk (HR). Following a 5.0-year median follow-up, the estimated 5-year event-free survival (EFS) +/- SE for all patients was 83% +/- 2%, which is superior to prior DFCI ALL Consortium protocols conducted between 1981 and 1991 (P =.03). There was no significant difference in 5-year EFS based upon risk group (87% +/- 3% for SR and 81% +/- 3% for HR, P =.24). Age at diagnosis was a statistically significant prognostic factor (P =.03), with inferior outcomes observed in infants and children 9 years or older. Patients who tolerated 25 or fewer weeks of asparaginase had a significantly worse outcome than those who received at least 26 weeks of asparaginase (P <.01, both univariate and multivariate). Older children (at least 9 years of age) were significantly more likely to have tolerated 25 or fewer weeks of asparaginase (P <.01). Treatment on Protocol 91-01 significantly improved the outcome of children with ALL, perhaps due to the prolonged asparaginase intensification and/or the use of dexamethasone. The inferior outcome of older children may be due, in part, to increased intolerance of intensive therapy.","['Silverman, L B', 'Gelber, R D', 'Dalton, V K', 'Asselin, B L', 'Barr, R D', 'Clavell, L A', 'Hurwitz, C A', 'Moghrabi, A', 'Samson, Y', 'Schorin, M A', 'Arkin, S', 'Declerck, L', 'Cohen, H J', 'Sallan, S E']","['Silverman LB', 'Gelber RD', 'Dalton VK', 'Asselin BL', 'Barr RD', 'Clavell LA', 'Hurwitz CA', 'Moghrabi A', 'Samson Y', 'Schorin MA', 'Arkin S', 'Declerck L', 'Cohen HJ', 'Sallan SE']","[""Department of Pediatric Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, the Division of Hematology/Oncology, Children's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02215, USA. lewis_silverman@dfci.harvard.edu""]",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', 'EC 3.5.1.1 (Asparaginase)', 'DFCI 91-01 protocol']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/administration & dosage/standards/*therapeutic use/toxicity', 'Asparaginase/administration & dosage/standards/toxicity', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Clinical Protocols', 'Dexamethasone/administration & dosage/standards/toxicity', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Doxorubicin/administration & dosage/standards/toxicity', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy', 'Risk Factors', 'Treatment Outcome']",,2001/02/27 10:00,2001/04/21 10:01,['2001/02/27 10:00'],"['2001/02/27 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/04/21 10:01 [medline]', '2001/02/27 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 2001 Mar 1;97(5):1211-8. doi: 10.1182/blood.v97.5.1211.,,,"['10.1182/blood.v97.5.1211 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)56238-1 [pii]']",,"['CA 68484/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA06516/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Recently identified new DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) genes, DNMT3A and DNMT3B, code for de novo methyltransferases. To determine the roles of DNMT3A, DNMT3B, as well as DNMT1, in the development of leukemia, competitive polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays were performed and the expression levels of DNMTs were measured in normal hematopoiesis, 33 cases of acute myelogenous leukemia (AML), and 17 cases of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML). All genes were constitutively expressed, although at different levels, in T lymphocytes, monocytes, neutrophils, and normal bone marrow cells. Interestingly, DNMT3B was expressed at high levels in CD34(+) bone marrow cells but down-regulated in differentiated cells. In AML, 5.3-, 4.4-, and 11.7-fold mean increases were seen in the levels of DNMT1, 3A, and 3B, respectively, compared with the control bone marrow cells. Although CML cells in the chronic phase did not show significant changes, cells in the acute phase showed 3.2-, 4.5-, and 3.4-fold mean increases in the levels of DNMT1, 3A, and 3B, respectively. Using methylation-specific PCR, it was observed that the p15(INAK4B) gene, a cell cycle regulator, was methylated in 24 of 33 (72%) cases of AML. Furthermore, AML cells with methylated p15(INAK4B) tended to express higher levels of DNMT1 and 3B. In conclusion, DNMTs were substantially overexpressed in leukemia cells in a leukemia type- and stage-specific manner. Up-regulated DNMTs may contribute to the pathogenesis of leukemia by inducing aberrant regional hypermethylation.

MATERIAL AND METHOD: Analysis of the information obtained from the Cancer Registry of Tarragona (Spain) between 1980-1994. The leukemias were classified in: acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), acute myelogenous leukemia (AML), chronic lymphoid leukemia (CLL) and chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). The estimated incidence rates have been adjusted to the worldwide population, the percentage of the incidence annual change through Poisson regression models and the relative survival using the registry of death rate of Catalonia. RESULTS: The adjusted rate for leukemias between the period 1990-1994 was 8.0 per 100,000 inhabitants in men and of 5.2 in women, being the CLL the most frequent subtype. Regarding the trend of incidence an increase of the CLL of 2.2% annual (CI 95%, 0.1-6.6) in men and of 7.7% (CI 95%, 1.4-14.4) in women was observed. In the remaining subtypes, there was no trend, but the non-classified leukemias decreased a -10.8% annual (CI 95%, -15.0 to -6.4) in men and a -9.9% annual (CI 95%, 15.4 to -4.0) in women. 5-year relative survival (RS5y) for the total leukemias was 37.7% in men and 45.3% in women. It stands out the CLL with a RS5y of 64.8% in men and of 75.7% in women and childhood ALL with a RS5y of 83.0% in boys and of 84.9% in girls. CONCLUSIONS: In Tarragona, Spain, an increase of the CLL incidence has been observed suggesting an improvement in the diagnosis, parallel to a decrease of the non-classified leukemias. The survival in this cohort of patients was similar to the that reported in other european registries.","['Gonzalez, J R', 'Moreno, V', 'Maria Borras, J', 'Borras, J', 'Galceran, J', 'Granena, A', 'Bosch, F X']","['Gonzalez JR', 'Moreno V', 'Maria Borras J', 'Borras J', 'Galceran J', 'Granena A', 'Bosch FX']","[""Servicio de Prevencion y Control del Cancer.

By employing the PKC inhibitor, bisindolylmaleimide I and cotransfecting the reporter LTR construct with a vector expressing PKC-alpha, we demonstrated, in the present study, that this effect of TPA was not only independent of, but actually antagonized by, PKC. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays together with antibody-mediated supershift and immuno-coprecipitation analyses, revealed that the posttranslational activation of Sp1 was exerted by inducing the formation of Sp1-p53 heterocomplex capable of binding to the Sp1 site in ERR-1. Furthermore, we demonstrated that Jurkat cells contain both wild-type (w.t.) and mutant forms of p53 and we detected both of them in this complex at variable combinations; some molecules of the complex contained either the w.t. or the mutant p53 separately, whereas others contained the two of them together. Finally, we showed that the Sp1-p53 complexes could bind also to an Sp1 site present in the promoter of another gene such as the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21(WAF-1), but not to consensus recognition sequences of the w.t. p53. Therefore, we speculate that there might be several other PKC-independent biological effects of TPA which result from interaction of such Sp1-p53 complexes with Sp1 recognition sites residing in the promoters of a wide variety of cellular and viral genes.","['Torgeman, A', 'Mor-Vaknin, N', 'Zelin, E', 'Ben-Aroya, Z', 'Lochelt, M', 'Flugel, R M', 'Aboud, M']","['Torgeman A', 'Mor-Vaknin N', 'Zelin E', 'Ben-Aroya Z', 'Lochelt M', 'Flugel RM', 'Aboud M']","['Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Ben Gurion University of the Negev, Beer Sheva 84105, Israel.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Virology,Virology,0110674,"['0 (CDKN1A protein, human)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21)', '0 (Cyclins)', '0 (Indoles)', '0 (Macromolecular Substances)', '0 (Maleimides)', '0 (Sp1 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '83HN0GTJ6D (Cyclosporine)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'MBK3OO5K8T (bisindolylmaleimide)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Line', 'Consensus Sequence/genetics', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21', 'Cyclins/genetics', 'Cyclosporine/pharmacology', 'DNA/genetics/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Viral/*drug effects', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Indoles/pharmacology', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Macromolecular Substances', 'Maleimides/pharmacology', 'Mutation/genetics', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/genetics', 'Protein Binding/drug effects', 'Protein Kinase C/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Response Elements/genetics', 'Sp1 Transcription Factor/*metabolism', 'Terminal Repeat Sequences/*genetics', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/*antagonists & inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Transcriptional Activation/drug effects', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/genetics/*metabolism']",,2001/02/27 10:00,2001/04/03 10:01,['2001/02/27 10:00'],"['2001/02/27 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/04/03 10:01 [medline]', '2001/02/27 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Virology. 2001 Mar 1;281(1):10-20. doi: 10.1006/viro.2000.0779.,,['Copyright 2001 Academic Press.'],"['10.1006/viro.2000.0779 [doi]', 'S0042-6822(00)90779-7 [pii]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Induction of apoptosis in rat lung epithelial cells.,94-106,"JP-8 is a kerosene-based fuel widely used by the U.S. military. Various models of human occupational and animal exposure to JP-8 have demonstrated the potential for local and systemic toxicity but the mechanisms involved are unknown. The purpose of our investigation was to study the molecular mechanisms of JP-8 toxicity by using an in vitro model. JP-8 exposure in a rat lung alveolar type II epithelial cell line (RLE-6TN) induces biochemical and morphological markers of apoptotic cell death: caspase-3 activation, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) cleavage, chromatin condensation, membrane blebbing, cytochrome c release from mitochondria, and genomic DNA cleavage into both oligonucleosomal (DNA ladder) and high-molecular-weight (HMW) fragments. The human histiocytic lymphoma cell line (U937) also responds to JP-8 with caspase-3 activation, cleavage of caspase substrates, including PARP, DNA-PK, and lamin B1, and degradation of genomic DNA with the production of HMW fragments. Caspase-3 activation and PARP cleavage also occur in the acute T-cell leukemia cell line (Jurkat) following treatment with JP-8. Furthermore, Jurkat cells stably transfected with a plasmid encoding the antiapoptotic protein Bcl-x(L) or pretreated with the pan-caspase inhibitor Boc-d-fmk, are relatively resistant to the cytotoxic effects of JP-8 compared to control cells. Finally, we demonstrate that PARP cleavage occurs in primary mouse thymocytes exposed to JP-8. In conclusion, our data support the hypothesis that apoptotic cell death is responsible at least partially for the cytotoxic effects of JP-8 and suggest that inhibition of the apoptotic cascade might reduce JP-8 toxicity.","['Stoica, B A', 'Boulares, A H', 'Rosenthal, D S', 'Iyer, S', 'Hamilton, I D', 'Smulson, M E']","['Stoica BA', 'Boulares AH', 'Rosenthal DS', 'Iyer S', 'Hamilton ID', 'Smulson ME']","['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Georgetown University School of Medicine, Washington, D.C. 20007, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Toxicol Appl Pharmacol,Toxicology and applied pharmacology,0416575,"['0 (BCL2L1 protein, human)', '0 (Bcl2l1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Bcl2l1 protein, rat)', '0 (Caspase Inhibitors)', '0 (Chromatin)', '0 (Cytochrome c Group)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Hydrocarbons)', '0 (JP8 aviation fuel)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (bcl-X Protein)', 'EC 2.4.2.30 (Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Casp3 protein, mouse)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Casp3 protein, rat)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Caspase 3', 'Caspase Inhibitors', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Membrane/pathology', 'Chromatin/ultrastructure', 'Cytochrome c Group/metabolism', 'DNA Fragmentation', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Epithelial Cells/pathology', 'Humans', 'Hydrocarbons/administration & dosage/*toxicity', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Lung/*pathology', 'Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse/pathology', 'Mice', 'Monocytes/pathology', 'Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/genetics/physiology', 'Pulmonary Alveoli/drug effects/pathology', 'Rats', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'bcl-X Protein']",,2001/02/27 10:00,2001/04/03 10:01,['2001/02/27 10:00'],"['2001/02/27 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/04/03 10:01 [medline]', '2001/02/27 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Toxicol Appl Pharmacol. 2001 Mar 1;171(2):94-106. doi: 10.1006/taap.2000.9108.,,['Copyright 2001 Academic Press.'],"['10.1006/taap.2000.9108 [doi]', 'S0041-008X(00)99108-7 [pii]']",,"['P01CA74175-04/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01CA25344/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Magnetic resonance imaging was performed in adult patients with pancytopaenia and hypocellular bone marrow. Coronal T1 weighted and STIR images were obtained, and analysed semiquantitatively. These data were compared with diagnosis, peripheral blood counts and bone marrow histology at diagnosis and at the time of the MRI examination. RESULTS: Patients were examined 2-84 months after diagnosis (median, 16 months). In AA, 11/13 patients showed a fatty, faint or nodular pattern. In h-MDS, the majority of the patients (10/14) had a scattered or uniform signal pattern. In AA, a significant correlation was found between the degree of femoral cellularity and disease duration. Only three cases had diffuse high signal on STIR: among them, one had paroxysmal nocturnal haemoglobinuria and the other developed acute leukaemia 3 months after MRI examination. Four patients have died: three with h-MDS presenting a scattered (two cases) or a uniform (one case) MRI signal and one with AA (with a nodular pattern) CONCLUSION: In AA, femoral haemopoiesis is usually not pronounced, and if present, does not contribute to the improvement of blood counts. In h-MDS, patients with discrete femoral haemopoiesis had an improvement in their blood counts with disease duration, similar to that found in AA. Conversely, in patients with pronounced femoral cellularity, blood counts remained stable or had deteriorated since diagnosis. This favours the hypothesis that, as is observed in MDS with a hypercellular marrow, scattered or uniform marrow patterns in femoral MRI are signs of more aggressive disease.","['Lorand-Metze, I', 'Santiago, G F', 'Lima, C S', 'Zanardi, V A', 'Torriani, M']","['Lorand-Metze I', 'Santiago GF', 'Lima CS', 'Zanardi VA', 'Torriani M']","['Department of Internal Medicine State University of Campinas, Brazil.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Clin Radiol,Clinical radiology,1306016,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Anemia, Aplastic/blood/*pathology', 'Blood Cell Count', 'Bone Marrow Cells/*pathology', 'Disease Progression', 'Female', 'Femur/pathology', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/blood/*pathology']",,2001/02/27 10:00,2001/04/03 10:01,['2001/02/27 10:00'],"['2001/02/27 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/04/03 10:01 [medline]', '2001/02/27 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Clin Radiol. 2001 Feb;56(2):107-10. doi: 10.1053/crad.2000.0570.,,['Copyright 2001 The Royal College of Radiologists.'],"['10.1053/crad.2000.0570 [doi]', 'S0009-9260(00)90570-1 [pii]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We reexamined their cytotoxicity in defined cell lines both as single agents and in combination with agents which may be of value in human malignant disease. METHODS: Cells were grown to confluence following inoculation at 5,000-8,000 cells/well in 96-well dishes, and growth patterns and death were determined by an MTT assay. Median effect analysis was used to look for synergy, additive effects, or antagonism between the cyclosporins and drugs with antitumor effects in humans. RESULTS: Cyclosporin A and PSC 833 were found to have cytotoxic activity at clinically achievable concentrations in breast, leukemia, and prostate cell lines. Synergistic or additive effects were demonstrated in all three prostate cell lines when PSC 833 was combined with estramustine, etoposide, ketoconazole, suramin, or vinorelbine in the prostate cancer cell lines. Cell line-selective additive effects or synergism were also identified with bicalutamide, carboplatin, cisplatinum, cis-retinoic acid, dexamethasone, 5-fluorouracil, liarozole, and trans-retinoic acid. CONLCLUSIONS: PSC 833 or cyclosporin alone or in combination with other agents may have an anticancer effect independently of their modulatory action on MDR. Several of the synergistic combinations which are not mediated by the MDR pump need to be tested in vivo for efficacy.","['Kreis, W', 'Budman, D R', 'Calabro, A']","['Kreis W', 'Budman DR', 'Calabro A']","['Don Monti Division of Oncology, North Shore University Hospital, Manhasset, NY 11030, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol,Cancer chemotherapy and pharmacology,7806519,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Cyclosporins)', '83HN0GTJ6D (Cyclosporine)', 'Q7ZP55KF3X (valspodar)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/antagonists & inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Cyclosporine/antagonists & inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Cyclosporins/antagonists & inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Drug Synergism', 'Humans', 'Time Factors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,2001/02/28 10:00,2001/03/07 10:01,['2001/02/28 10:00'],"['2001/02/28 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/07 10:01 [medline]', '2001/02/28 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol. 2001;47(1):78-82. doi: 10.1007/s002800000191.,,,['10.1007/s002800000191 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: The mouse lymphocytic leukemia cell line L1210 and pig kidney proximal tubular epithelial cell line LLC-PK1 were used as neoplastic and normal cells, respectively. These cells were treated with various concentrations of ADM for 24 h and toxicological parameters were determined. RESULTS: ADM (0.1-10 microM) significantly down-regulated cell growth rate and [3H]thymidine incorporation into DNA in the log phase, and at concentrations of more than 1 microM reduced the viability of both cell lines. Lipid peroxidation was increased at 1 microM ADM in L1210 cells and at 10 microM ADM in LLC-PK1 cells. The microsomal and nuclear fractions of both cell lines showed approximately the same level of ADM-induced superoxide anion (O2-) production, while the mitochondrial fraction of differentiated LLC-PK1 cells produced the highest levels of O2-. Differentiated LLC-PK1 cells showed the highest mitochondrial NADH-cytochrome c reductase activity. L1210 cells showed lower mitochondrial activities of enzymes involved in scavenging of reactive oxygen species, such as superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase and catalase, than the other cells. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that ADM exerts cytostatic effects on neoplastic and normal undifferentiated cells through the inhibition of DNA synthesis by DNA intercalation, and cytotoxic effects on neoplastic cells through the accumulation of reactive oxygen species resulting from low scavenger enzyme activities. The cytotoxic effects on normal differentiated cells may be related to the high levels of production of reactive oxygen species due to high mitochondrial NADH-cytochrome c reductase activity.","['Kiyomiya, K', 'Matsuo, S', 'Kurebe, M']","['Kiyomiya K', 'Matsuo S', 'Kurebe M']","['Department of Toxicology, School of Veterinary Medicine, Osaka Prefecture University, Sakai, Japan. kiyomiya@vet.osakafu-u.ac.jp']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Germany,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol,Cancer chemotherapy and pharmacology,7806519,"['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Cytochrome c Group)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '0U46U6E8UK (NAD)', '11062-77-4 (Superoxides)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cytochrome c Group/metabolism', 'Down-Regulation', 'Doxorubicin/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'LLC-PK1 Cells/*drug effects', 'Leukemia L1210/*drug therapy', 'Lipid Peroxidation/drug effects', 'Mice', 'Microsomes/drug effects/metabolism', 'Mitochondria/drug effects/metabolism', 'NAD/metabolism', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism', 'Superoxides/metabolism', 'Swine', 'Time Factors']",,2001/02/28 10:00,2001/03/07 10:01,['2001/02/28 10:00'],"['2001/02/28 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/07 10:01 [medline]', '2001/02/28 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol. 2001;47(1):51-6. doi: 10.1007/s002800000201.,,,['10.1007/s002800000201 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: A group of 18 patients were studied during the first course of treatment at dose levels between 40 and 120 mg/m2. Blood samples were obtained up to 72 h after infusion. The liposomal and free forms of daunorubicin, as well as daunorubicinol, were separated and quantified by HPLC using fluorometric detection, and data were analysed using a model-independent approach. RESULTS: Unchanged liposomal daunorubicin disappeared from plasma following a monoexponential decay. Its AUC represented 95.8% of the total fluorescent species found in plasma and increased linearly with the dose administered. The elimination half-life was 5.23 h, total plasma clearance 0.344 1/h per m2, and volume of distribution at steady state 2.08 l/m2. Free daunorubicin and daunorubicinol were detected in plasma at all time-points studied. Their AUCs represented, respectively, 2.53% and 1.70% of total fluorescent species and their elimination half-lives were, respectively, 16.6 h and 22.3 h. The daunorubicinol/daunorubicin AUC ratio was 0.82%. CONCLUSIONS: This study is the first to demonstrate that free daunorubicin is present in plasma after DaunoXome administration and that it originates from in vivo release from the liposomes. The pharmacokinetics of free daunorubicin appeared to be comparable to those observed after conventional administration. However, the concentration of daunorubicinol appeared to be lower than that found after conventional administration of daunorubicin.","['Bellott, R', 'Auvrignon, A', 'Leblanc, T', 'Perel, Y', 'Gandemer, V', 'Bertrand, Y', 'Mechinaud, F', 'Bellenger, P', 'Vernois, J', 'Leverger, G', 'Baruchel, A', 'Robert, J']","['Bellott R', 'Auvrignon A', 'Leblanc T', 'Perel Y', 'Gandemer V', 'Bertrand Y', 'Mechinaud F', 'Bellenger P', 'Vernois J', 'Leverger G', 'Baruchel A', 'Robert J']","['Institut Bergonie, Bordeaux, France.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Clinical Trial, Phase I', 'Clinical Trial, Phase II', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol,Cancer chemotherapy and pharmacology,7806519,"['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Drug Carriers)', '0 (Liposomes)', 'YDU8YIP30L (daunorubicinol)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/blood/*pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Daunorubicin/analogs & derivatives/blood/*pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use', 'Drug Carriers', 'Female', 'Half-Life', 'Humans', 'Liposomes', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*blood/drug therapy', 'Recurrence', 'Time Factors']",,2001/02/28 10:00,2001/03/07 10:01,['2001/02/28 10:00'],"['2001/02/28 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/07 10:01 [medline]', '2001/02/28 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol. 2001;47(1):15-21. doi: 10.1007/s002800000206.,,,['10.1007/s002800000206 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In agreement with this hypothesis, a significant inverse correlation between telomere length and chromosomal radiosensitivity was observed in lymphocytes from 24 breast cancer patients and 5 normal individuals. In contrast, no chromosomal radiosensitivity was observed in mouse cell lines that showed shortened telomeres, possibly reflecting differences in radiation responses between primary cells and established cell lines.

We tested the hypothesis that cells sense sublethal incorporation of analogues into DNA during replication and react by arresting further DNA synthesis and cell cycle progression. After removal of drug, cells may be able to repair damaged DNA and continue proliferation, thus escaping nucleoside analogue toxicity. As a corollary, we evaluated whether dysregulation of this mechanism causes cell death. Using gemcitabine as a model of S-phase-specific nucleoside analogues in human acute myelogenous leukemia ML-1 cells, we found that DNA synthesis decreased, cells arrested in S-phase transit, and 60-70% of the population accumulated in S-phase in response to cytostatic conditions. Proliferation continued after washing the cells into drug-free medium. S-phase-arrested cells were then treated with otherwise nontoxic concentrations of UCN-01, which caused rapid onset of apoptosis without cell cycle progression specifically in cells with an S-phase DNA content. Thus, S-phase arrest by nucleoside analogues sensitizes cells to UCN-01, which appears to activate signaling for death mechanisms and/or inhibit survival pathways.

DESIGN: A retrospective study of feline lymphosarcoma cases. METHODS: Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tumour tissue of 14 feline lymphosarcomas was examined for the presence of feline leukaemia virus and feline immunodeficiency virus by polymerase chain reaction and immunohistochemistry. Using polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies against T and B lymphocytes, the phenotypic expression of the tumours was characterised. RESULTS: No feline leukaemia virus antigen or proviral sequences were detected. Feline immunodeficiency virus proviral sequences were detected in two cases by polymerase chain reaction. Immunophenotyping of all 14 cases resulted in seven cases being classified as B-cell phenotype, four as T-cell phenotype, and the remaining three undetermined. CONCLUSIONS: In contrast to previous reports overseas, our results suggest that feline leukaemia virus infection appears to be an infrequent cause of lymphosarcoma in the cats that were necropsied. Feline immunodeficiency virus may have a role in lymphomagenesis. The potential role of feline immunodeficiency virus needs to be explored in more depth. Compared with most previous reports, B-cell tumours were more common than T-cell tumours in this series of cats.","['Wang, J', 'Kyaw-Tanner, M', 'Lee, C', 'Robinson, W F']","['Wang J', 'Kyaw-Tanner M', 'Lee C', 'Robinson WF']","['School of Veterinary Science, University of Queensland, Brisbane, Queensland 4072.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Aust Vet J,Australian veterinary journal,0370616,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (DNA, Viral)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cat Diseases/*virology', 'Cats', 'DNA Primers', 'DNA, Viral/*isolation & purification', 'Female', 'Immunodeficiency Virus, Feline/genetics/*isolation & purification', 'Immunohistochemistry/veterinary', 'Immunophenotyping/veterinary', 'Leukemia Virus, Feline/genetics/immunology/*isolation & purification', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/*veterinary/virology', 'Male', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction/veterinary', 'Retrospective Studies']",,2001/02/28 10:00,2001/05/05 10:01,['2001/02/28 10:00'],"['2001/02/28 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/05/05 10:01 [medline]', '2001/02/28 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Aust Vet J. 2001 Jan;79(1):41-6. doi: 10.1111/j.1751-0813.2001.tb10639.x.,,,['10.1111/j.1751-0813.2001.tb10639.x [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Vitamin K deficiency can account for vitamin K deficiency bleeding (VKDB) which occurs in 3 forms--early, classic and late. Vitamin K should be administered to all neonates at birth or immediately afterwards. However, the protocols for administration (route of administration, dosage, number of doses) remain a subject of discussion. Oral administration of a single dose of vitamin K protects against classical and early VKDB, but is less effective than intramuscular (IM) prophylaxis for the prevention of late VKDB. Although an increased risk of solid tumour, associated vitamin K administration, can be definitively excluded, a low potential risk of lymphoblastic leukaemia in childhood can not be ruled out. For formula-fed neonates without risk of haemorrhage, a 2 mg oral dose of vitamin K at birth, followed by a second 2 mg oral dose between day 2 and 7, is probably sufficient to prevent VKDB. For infants who are exclusively or nearly exclusively breast-fed, weekly oral administration of 2mg (or 25 microg/day) vitamin K after the initial 2 oral doses is justified at completion of breast-feeding. For neonates at high risk of haemorrhage (premature, neonatal disease, birth asphyxia, difficult delivery, any illness which will delay feeding, known hepatic disease, maternal drugs inhibiting vitamin K activity), the first dose must be administered by the IM or slow intravenous route. Doses should be repeated, particularly in premature infants, by a route of administration decided for each dose according to the clinical state of the infant. For infants of mothers treated with drugs inhibiting vitamin K activity, antenatal maternal prophylaxis (10 to 20 mg/day orally for 15 to 30 days before delivery) prevents early VKDB. After neonatal prophylaxis, as for infants at high risk of haemorrhage, doses need to be repeated at a rate and route of administration decided for each dose, according to the clotting factor profile specific for each infant.","['Autret-Leca, E', 'Jonville-Bera, A P']","['Autret-Leca E', 'Jonville-Bera AP']","['Department of Clinical Pharmacology, H pital Bretonneau, University Francois Rabelais, Tours, France. autret-leca@med.univ-tours.fr']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Switzerland,Paediatr Drugs,Paediatric drugs,100883685,"['0 (Anticonvulsants)', '12001-79-5 (Vitamin K)']",IM,"['Anticonvulsants/therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Hemorrhage/*drug therapy/etiology', 'Humans', '*Infant, Newborn/blood', 'Neoplasms/blood', 'Pregnancy', 'Prenatal Care/methods', 'Risk Factors', 'Vitamin K/*administration & dosage/blood', 'Vitamin K Deficiency/complications/*drug therapy']",68,2001/02/28 10:00,2001/05/01 10:01,['2001/02/28 10:00'],"['2001/02/28 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/05/01 10:01 [medline]', '2001/02/28 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Paediatr Drugs. 2001;3(1):1-8. doi: 10.2165/00128072-200103010-00001.,,,['10.2165/00128072-200103010-00001 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

MATERIAL AND METHODS: In the period from January 1999. to September 2000. at the Oncology Department on Pediatric Clinic in Sarajevo we placed PICC in 18 patients with leukemia. Catheters were introduced through vena cubitalis and EMLA was used like local anestetic, All these manipulations were done with respect to asepsa rules. Tip of the catheter had to be situated in vena cava superior and its right position was checked by ultrasound. Management of catheter included everydays heparinisation, according strictly ordered rules and respect asepsa rules. RESULTS: PICC was placed in 18 patients with average of 6.5 years. According sex there were 61.1% males, and 38.9% females. Average period of using catheter was 2.7 months. In 44.4% cases catheter was taken out after finished treatment, but in 22.2% cases we had mechanical complications (spontaneous breakage of catheter or stop in it). In 33.3% patients catheter is still in function. CONCLUSION: Using PICC in patients with leukemia made significantly easier their treatment regarding decreasing of their traumatisation, regarding simplier vein access and reduction of the infection. In our investigated group we had not infection what was very important fact for outcome of this serious disease.","['Hasanbegovic, E', 'Sabanovic, S', 'Majstorovic, S']","['Hasanbegovic E', 'Sabanovic S', 'Majstorovic S']","['Pedijatrijska klinika, Klinicki centar Univerziteta u Sarajevu.']",['hrv'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Bosnia and Herzegovina,Med Arh,Medicinski arhiv,0400722,,IM,"['Arm/blood supply', 'Catheterization, Central Venous/*methods', 'Child', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*therapy', 'Male', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Vena Cava, Superior']",,2001/02/28 10:00,2001/03/17 10:01,['2001/02/28 10:00'],"['2001/02/28 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/17 10:01 [medline]', '2001/02/28 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Med Arh. 2000;54(5-6):311-2.,Primjena periferno apliciranog centralnog katetera u tretmanu pedijatrijskih pacijenata oboljelih od leukemije.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, in these studies the host immune-mediated effects, which may be important in mediating the long-term control of tumor growth by these cytokines, was not studied. In this paper, we evaluate the antitumor efficacy of different adenoviral vectors containing mouse IFN-alpha genes (i.e., a first-generation replication-defective vector containing IFN-alpha1 and two different second-generation vectors containing IFN-alpha2) in immunocompetent DBA/2 mice transplanted with highly metastatic Friend leukemic cells resistant in vitro to type I IFN. We found that injection of all the different adenovirus vectors containing mouse IFN-alpha( genes resulted in a marked antitumor response in mice transplanted either subcutaneously or intravenously with IFN-resistant Friend leukemic cells compared to tumor-bearing animals inoculated with a control vector. Tumor growth inhibition after injection of IFN-adenovirus vectors was associated with a prolonged presence of high IFN levels in the sera of the injected mice. Suppression of metastatic tumor growth was also observed after a single injection of the IFN--adenovirus recombinant vectors, whereas a comparable antitumor response generally required several injections of high doses of IFN. Altogether, these results demonstrate that IFN--adenoviral vectors can efficiently inhibit metastatic tumor growth by host-mediated mechanisms and suggest that adenovirus-mediated IFN-alpha gene therapy may represent an attractive alternative to the conventional clinical use of this cytokine, which generally requires multiple injections of high IFN doses for a prolonged period of time.","['Santodonato, L', 'Ferrantini, M', 'Palombo, F', 'Aurisicchio, L', 'Delmastro, P', 'La Monica, N', 'Di Marco, S', 'Ciliberto, G', 'Du, M X', 'Taylor, M W', 'Belardelli, F']","['Santodonato L', 'Ferrantini M', 'Palombo F', 'Aurisicchio L', 'Delmastro P', 'La Monica N', 'Di Marco S', 'Ciliberto G', 'Du MX', 'Taylor MW', 'Belardelli F']","['Laboratory of Virology, Istituto Superiore di Sanita, Rome, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Cancer Gene Ther,Cancer gene therapy,9432230,['0 (Interferon-alpha)'],IM,"['Adenoviridae/*genetics', 'Animals', 'Friend murine leukemia virus', 'Genetic Therapy', 'Genetic Vectors', 'Injections, Intraperitoneal', 'Injections, Intravenous', 'Interferon-alpha/blood/*genetics/metabolism', 'Lac Operon/physiology', 'Leukemia, Experimental/immunology/*therapy', 'Liver Neoplasms, Experimental/pathology/prevention & control', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred DBA', 'Mice, Nude', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Survival Analysis', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,2001/02/24 12:00,2001/05/01 10:01,['2001/02/24 12:00'],"['2001/02/24 12:00 [pubmed]', '2001/05/01 10:01 [medline]', '2001/02/24 12:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Gene Ther. 2001 Jan;8(1):63-72. doi: 10.1038/sj.cgt.7700274.,,,['10.1038/sj.cgt.7700274 [doi]'],,['F06 TW022641/TW/FIC NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,

CD34+ cells selection in vitro may deplete T-cells 4-5 logs and tumor cells 3-4 logs. It will benefit to mismatched related donor allo-transplantation and autologous transplantation of tumor diseases. METHODS: 19 patients aged 29 (5-52) years were treated by allo- (n = 5) or auto-PB CD34+ cells transplantation (n = 14). Grafts from fifteen patients with various disorders (3 lymphomas, 6 multiple myelomas, 2 SLE, 1 Sjogren's syndrome, 2 breast cancer and 1 medulloblastoma) and five haploidentical donors for leukemia patients (1 ALL-CR2, 2 AML-rel, 1 CML-CP and 1 MDS-RAEB) were isolated using magnetic-activated cell sorting (CliniMACS, Milteny Biotech, Germany). RESULTS: After separation, purity of CD34+ cells was > 97%. Depletion of CD34 negative cells was extensive: CD3+ 2.6-4.6 logs, CD4+ > 5 logs, CD8+ 4.6-> 5 logs, and CD19+ 1.2-3.1 logs. 19 patients who received selected CD34+ cells transplantation (CD34+ CT) were followed up for 11(1-20) months. Overall survival(OS) was 13/19 (68.4%) cases. 1/5 patients with haploidentical transplant had disease free survival for 19 months. 12/14(85.7%) auto-CD34+ CT achieved overall survival(OS). CONCLUSION: Selected CD34+ cells transplantation significantly decreases the incidence of > II GVHD and depletes tumor cell contamination. This approach may be useful to haploidentical or unrelated donor transplantation. It also benefits autologous transplant in various tumor disorders.","['Dong, L', 'Chen, H', 'Jiang, M']","['Dong L', 'Chen H', 'Jiang M']","['Bone Marrow Transplantation Center, North Taiping Hospital, Beijing 100039, China.']",['chi'],"['Case Reports', 'English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",China,Zhonghua Yi Xue Za Zhi,Zhonghua yi xue za zhi,7511141,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (HLA Antigens)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antigens, CD34/*blood', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'HLA Antigens', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Transplantation, Autologous', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",,2001/02/24 12:00,2002/10/09 04:00,['2001/02/24 12:00'],"['2001/02/24 12:00 [pubmed]', '2002/10/09 04:00 [medline]', '2001/02/24 12:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Zhonghua Yi Xue Za Zhi. 2000 Nov;80(11):841-4.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The most common cause of cervical lymphadenopathy is infection in the area of drainage (virtually anywhere in the head and neck). Most frequent of all is an enlarged jugulodigastric (tonsillar) lymph node, inflamed secondary to a viral upper respiratory tract infection. Enlarged cervical lymph nodes may also be a manifestation of systemic infection (e.g. HIV/AIDS), or related to malignant disease in the drainage area (e.g. carcinoma) or elsewhere (e.g. leukaemia or lymphoma).

METHODS: First, the use of natural receptor for stem cell factor and transferrin receptor-targeted gene transfer using poly-L-lysine-based molecular conjugate vectors was evaluated in a panel of hematopoietic progenitor cell lines. Second, the ability of poly-L-lysine to enhance adenovirus mediated gene transfer efficiency was examined in different cell lines by using recombinant adenovirus-poly-L-lysine molecular conjugate conglomerates (recMCVEGFP). RESULTS: Despite effective ligand internalization receptor, gene expression amplification in receptor positive cell lines was not uniformly observed. Therefore, using a poly-L-lysine-based, receptor-targeted vector, neither transferrin nor natural receptor for stem cell factor mediated gene transfer can be considered a universally applicable procedure that exclusively depends on the presence of receptors on the cell surface; rather, it is a cell specific phenomenon. In our model, poly-L-lysine is the major contributor for gene transfer to hematopoietic progenitor cells, mediating the initial vector-cell binding. Human progenitor cell lines are poorly transduceable with recombinant adenovirus vectors. This new poly-L-lysine-modified, adenovirus-based vector could overcome virus tropism restrictions and consistently achieve very high transduction efficiency (>90%) in cells otherwise refractory to adenovirus gene transfer. CONCLUSIONS: Polylysine-based adenovirus vectors may have promise for situations in which high-efficiency gene transfer with transient high level transgene expression in hematopoietic cells is needed, such as leukemia vaccine protocols or for purging strategies in leukemia cell contaminated stem cell preparations.","['Schwarzenberger, P', 'Huang, W', 'Oliver, P', 'Osidipe, T', 'Theodossiou, C', 'Kolls, J K']","['Schwarzenberger P', 'Huang W', 'Oliver P', 'Osidipe T', 'Theodossiou C', 'Kolls JK']","['Department of Medicine, Louisiana State University Medical Center of New Orleans 70122, USA. pschwa1@lsuhsc.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Am J Med Sci,The American journal of the medical sciences,0370506,"['0 (CLMP protein, human)', '0 (Coxsackie and Adenovirus Receptor-Like Membrane Protein)', '0 (Receptors, Transferrin)', '0 (Receptors, Virus)', '25104-18-1 (Polylysine)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit)']",IM,"['Adenoviruses, Human/*genetics', 'Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung/pathology', 'Cell Adhesion', 'Cell Line', 'Coxsackie and Adenovirus Receptor-Like Membrane Protein', 'Endocytosis', 'Eye Neoplasms/pathology', 'Genes, Reporter', 'Genetic Vectors/*administration & dosage/genetics', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells/drug effects', 'Leukemia, Megakaryoblastic, Acute/pathology', 'Leukemia, Monocytic, Acute/pathology', 'Lung Neoplasms/pathology', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*drug effects', 'Polylysine/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit/drug effects', 'Receptors, Transferrin/drug effects', 'Receptors, Virus/drug effects', 'Retinoblastoma/pathology', 'Transfection/*methods', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,2001/02/24 12:00,2001/04/03 10:01,['2001/02/24 12:00'],"['2001/02/24 12:00 [pubmed]', '2001/04/03 10:01 [medline]', '2001/02/24 12:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Am J Med Sci. 2001 Feb;321(2):129-36. doi: 10.1097/00000441-200102000-00004.,,,"['S0002-9629(15)34704-2 [pii]', '10.1097/00000441-200102000-00004 [doi]']",,['R01-CA81125-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,

Leukemia is a very heterogeneous disease on the molecular level. Clonal chromosomal abnormalities can be found in the vast majority of cases. A broader understanding of the underlying molecular changes has enabled the development of risk-adapted therapy regimens with improved outcome. One example is the application of molecular genetic techniques for detecting small numbers of leukemia cells after therapy (""minimal residual disease""). This allows the early preclinical recognition and prevention of relapse. This study gives a short overview of the current status of molecular genetics in human leukemias and its implications for the therapy and prognosis of these diseases. The following topics are covered: generation of oncogenic fusion genes or dysregulation of protooncogenes by chromosomal translocations, detection of minimal residual disease based on clonally rearranged immunoglobulin or T-cell receptor genes or on leukemia-specific fusion genes, monitoring bone marrow chimerism after allogeneic transplantation by molecular genetic techniques, and the role of oncogenic herpesviruses and retroviruses in human hematologic malignancies.","['Burmeister, T', 'Thiel, E']","['Burmeister T', 'Thiel E']","['Freie Universitat Berlin, Medizinische Klinik III, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Germany,J Cancer Res Clin Oncol,Journal of cancer research and clinical oncology,7902060,,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Chromosome Aberrations/*genetics', 'Chromosome Disorders', 'Chronic Disease', 'Genetic Therapy', 'Herpesvirus 4, Human', 'Herpesvirus 8, Human', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*genetics/therapy/virology', 'Molecular Biology', '*Retroviridae', 'Translocation, Genetic', 'Tumor Virus Infections/complications']",75,2001/02/24 12:00,2001/03/10 10:01,['2001/02/24 12:00'],"['2001/02/24 12:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/10 10:01 [medline]', '2001/02/24 12:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Cancer Res Clin Oncol. 2001 Feb;127(2):80-90. doi: 10.1007/s004320000159.,,,['10.1007/s004320000159 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Total RNA was isolated from: 1) homogenized placental tissue; from 2) isolated and purified cytotrophoblast cells; and 3) cytotrophoblast and syncytiotrophoblast cells treated with cytokines in vitro. RNA was reverse transcribed and amplified by polymerase chain reaction, using specific primers for iNOS. Trophoblast cells were treated in vitro by interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) in a dose of 10 ng/mL, Interleukin 1beta (IL-1beta) (4 ng/mL) and leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) (1 ng/mL). Trophoblasts were also subjected to immunocytochemistry using iNOS-specific antibody to detect iNOS protein expression in these cells. RESULTS: The expression of iNOS mRNA was found both in placental tissue and isolated cytotrophoblast cells. In culture, the highly differentiated syncytiotrophoblast expressed more mRNA than cytotrophoblast cells. IFN-gamma and LIF, but not IL-1beta, induced iNOS mRNA expression in trophoblast cells in vitro. The effects of these cytokines on iNOS mRNA were only observed in syncytiotrophoblast cells, but not in cytotrophoblast cells. Immunocytochemical staining confirmed the trophoblast cells as a major source of the iNOS synthase production. CONCLUSIONS: 1) Human trophoblast cells are able to express the iNOS mRNA, hence suggesting a role for NO in placental growth and function. 2) LIF and IFN-gamma, but not IL-1beta, induce the iNOS mRNA expression in syncytiotrophoblast cells in vitro, suggesting possible similar regulatory mechanisms in vivo. 3) This study, for the first time, demonstrates the stimulating effect of LIF on iNOS gene expression in human tissue.","['Hambartsoumian, E', 'Srivastava, R K', 'Seibel, M M']","['Hambartsoumian E', 'Srivastava RK', 'Seibel MM']","['Fertility Center of New England/Faulkner Institute for Reproductive Medicine, Reading, MA 01867, USA. hambartsoumian@hotmail.com']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Denmark,Am J Reprod Immunol,"American journal of reproductive immunology (New York, N.Y. : 1989)",8912860,"['0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-1)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '31C4KY9ESH (Nitric Oxide)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)', 'EC 1.14.13.39 (NOS2 protein, human)', 'EC 1.14.13.39 (Nitric Oxide Synthase)', 'EC 1.14.13.39 (Nitric Oxide Synthase Type II)']",IM,"['Cells, Cultured', 'Female', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic', 'Growth Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Interferon-gamma/pharmacology', 'Interleukin-1/pharmacology', '*Interleukin-6', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Lymphokines/pharmacology', 'Nitric Oxide/biosynthesis', 'Nitric Oxide Synthase/*genetics', 'Nitric Oxide Synthase Type II', 'Pregnancy', 'RNA, Messenger/*analysis', 'Trophoblasts/*enzymology']",,2001/02/24 12:00,2001/04/17 10:01,['2001/02/24 12:00'],"['2001/02/24 12:00 [pubmed]', '2001/04/17 10:01 [medline]', '2001/02/24 12:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Am J Reprod Immunol. 2001 Feb;45(2):78-85. doi: 10.1111/j.8755-8920.2001.450203.x.,,,['10.1111/j.8755-8920.2001.450203.x [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The general availability of flow cytometers and an extensive panel of antibody reagents useful for characterizing blood cell lineage question the usefulness of continuing routine use of the cytochemical staining for the diagnosis of acute leukemia. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Test results were evaluated in 122 (n = 122; 112 with acute lymphocytic leukemia and 10 with acute myeloid leukemia) patients selected from among 320 patients with acute leukemia at Texas Children's Hospital in 1997 and 1998. Results were selected for review if the clinical encounter represented the initial diagnostic work-up and if data were available from cytochemical staining and flow cytometry studies. RESULTS: Cell lineage classification derived from flow cytometry and cytochemical stains were in agreement in all cases. Definitive diagnoses were feasible using flow cytometry results alone in 120 of 122 patients (98.4%) as compared with only 99 of 122 patients (81.2%) when only cytochemical staining results were considered. In two patients with inconclusive flow cytometry results, cytochemical staining alone provided information sufficient for diagnosis. CONCLUSIONS: Results from this study indicate that with few exceptions, flow cytometry studies alone provide sufficient information for diagnosis and management of acute leukemia in children. Nevertheless, cytochemical staining should be available for those cases in which flow cytometry results fail to allow a definitive diagnosis. A modified testing protocol is recommended.","['Mhawech, P', 'Buffone, G J', 'Khan, S P', 'Gresik, M V']","['Mhawech P', 'Buffone GJ', 'Khan SP', 'Gresik MV']","[""Department of Pathology, Baylor College of Medicine and Texas Children's Hospital, Houston, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol,Journal of pediatric hematology/oncology,9505928,"['0 (Azo Compounds)', '0 (Coloring Agents)', '0 (Naphthalenes)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '9YDL1Q990E (Sudan Black B)', 'EC 1.11.1.7 (Peroxidase)', 'EC 3.1.1.- (Carboxylic Ester Hydrolases)', 'EC 3.1.1.1 (Carboxylesterase)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Algorithms', 'Azo Compounds', 'Bone Marrow Examination/methods', 'Carboxylesterase', 'Carboxylic Ester Hydrolases/analysis', 'Cell Lineage', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Coloring Agents', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry/*methods', 'Humans', '*Immunophenotyping', 'Infant', 'Leukemia/classification/*diagnosis/metabolism/pathology', 'Male', 'Naphthalenes', 'Neoplasm Proteins/analysis', 'Periodic Acid-Schiff Reaction', 'Peroxidase/analysis', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Staining and Labeling/*methods']",,2001/02/24 12:00,2001/03/07 10:01,['2001/02/24 12:00'],"['2001/02/24 12:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/07 10:01 [medline]', '2001/02/24 12:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol. 2001 Feb;23(2):89-92. doi: 10.1097/00043426-200102000-00004.,,,['10.1097/00043426-200102000-00004 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: The NWTSG database was reviewed for cases of secondary AML and for WT1 status of the affected patients. Referring institutions were contacted by a confidential letter requesting pathology reports, results of immunophenotyping, cytogenetic, and molecular analyses, and details concerning treatment of AML. RESULTS: Of the 5,278 patients treated during the study period, 43 had second malignant neoplasms, and 7 of these 43 had AML. At the time of diagnosis of Wilms tumor, the median age of the seven patients (4 boys) was 3.2 years. Five of the seven renal neoplasms had favorable histologic characteristics. The most common French-American-British morphology was M5. One patient had bilateral tumors, and two were treated for recurrent Wilms tumor. All patients received chemotherapy regimens that included doxorubicin (6) or etoposide (1), and six were treated with infradiaphragmatic irradiation.

The increase in VP-16 cytotoxicity produced by novobiocin was not due to the combined effects of these agents on topoisomerase II, but to inhibition by novobiocin of VP-16 efflux, which in turn led to increased accumulation of VP-16 and increased formation of potentially lethal VP-16-stabilized topoisomerase II-DNA covalent complexes. We have now identified novobiocin analogs that are essentially equivalent to novobiocin as inhibitors of the activity of topoisomerase II, but that are more potent than novobiocin (a) as modulators of the cytotoxicity of VP-16 to WEHI-3B leukemia and A549 lung carcinoma cells and (b) in increasing VP-16 accumulation in these cell lines. Thus, removal of the sugar moiety of novobiocin to form novobiocic acid enhanced the potency of the antibiotic as a modulator of VP-16, whereas the substituted coumarin ring alone (U-7587) was devoid of VP-16 modulatory activity. Modifications of the side chain of novobiocin significantly influenced modulatory activity, with cyclonovobiocic acid, which was formed from novobiocic acid by acid-catalyzed cycloaddition, being the most active in enhancing the cytotoxicity of VP-16. The increased potency of novobiocic acid and cyclonovobiocic acid as modulators of VP-16 activity was achieved with no change from novobiocin in the capacity of these analogs to inhibit the catalytic activity of mammalian topoisomerase II, indicating a change in the specificity of these analogs.","['Rappa, G', 'Shyam, K', 'Lorico, A', 'Fodstad, O', 'Sartorelli, A C']","['Rappa G', 'Shyam K', 'Lorico A', 'Fodstad O', 'Sartorelli AC']","['Department of Tumor Biology, Norwegian Radium Hospital, Montebello, Oslo.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Oncol Res,Oncology research,9208097,"['0 (ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Multidrug Resistance-Associated Proteins)', '0 (Topoisomerase II Inhibitors)', '17EC19951N (Novobiocin)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', '8L70Q75FXE (Adenosine Triphosphate)']",IM,"['ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters/physiology', 'Adenosine Triphosphate/pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/*pharmacology', 'Drug Synergism', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Etoposide/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Multidrug Resistance-Associated Proteins', 'Novobiocin/*pharmacology', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', '*Topoisomerase II Inhibitors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,2001/02/24 12:00,2001/04/17 10:01,['2001/02/24 12:00'],"['2001/02/24 12:00 [pubmed]', '2001/04/17 10:01 [medline]', '2001/02/24 12:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Oncol Res. 2000;12(3):113-9. doi: 10.3727/096504001108747585.,,,['10.3727/096504001108747585 [doi]'],,['CA-66739/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,

However, there is not yet any effective therapy or prevention for cancer based on the molecular mechanisms of carcinogenesis. So-called ""gene therapy"" for cancer is expected to become a new method of treatment, but there are still several serious problems with gene therapy. As a matter of fact, it seems impossible to adopt gene therapy for prevention. We therefore tried to develop a different method of cancer prevention or therapy based on the molecular mechanisms of carcinogenesis. For instance, the tumor-suppressor gene p53 is mutated in about 50% of human malignancies. It is known that p53 stimulates the promoter activities of p21/WAF1, gadd45 and bax genes, resulting in cell cycle arrest, DNA repair and apoptosis, respectively. Therefore, chemical compounds that can stimulate these genes should compensate for the function of p53. As a model of this, we found that histone deacetylase inhibitors such as butyrate or trichostatin A dramatically stimulate the p21/WAF1 gene promoter through the Spl sites, resulting in cell cycle arrest. Interestingly, another group has recently reported that phenylbutyrate, which is also known as a histone deacetylase inhibitor, is very effective for leukemia patients. We therefore consider methods of up-regulating p21/WAF, gadd45 or bax genes should be useful for cancer therapy and termed this method ""Gene-regulating chemotherapy"". Theoretically, the chemicals up-regulating such genes should be also useful for chemoprevention, and we also termed it as ""Gene-regulating chemoprevention"". In conclusion, we propose that ""Gene-regulating chemotherapy or chemoprevention"" may be a promising new method for cancer therapy or prevention and histone deacetylase inhibitor is a good candidate for this method.","['Sowa, Y', 'Sakai, T']","['Sowa Y', 'Sakai T']","['Department of Preventive Medicine, Kyoto Prefectural University of Medicine, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",Netherlands,Biofactors,"BioFactors (Oxford, England)",8807441,"['0 (Butyrates)', '0 (Dietary Fiber)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Butyrates/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', '*Chemoprevention', 'Colorectal Neoplasms/pathology/prevention & control', 'Dietary Fiber/therapeutic use', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors', 'Humans', '*Models, Biological', 'Neoplasms/*drug therapy/*genetics/prevention & control']",20,2001/02/24 12:00,2001/04/21 10:01,['2001/02/24 12:00'],"['2001/02/24 12:00 [pubmed]', '2001/04/21 10:01 [medline]', '2001/02/24 12:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Biofactors. 2000;12(1-4):283-7. doi: 10.1002/biof.5520120142.,,,['10.1002/biof.5520120142 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Spices and herbs contain phenolic substances with potent antioxidative and chemopreventive properties. Curcumin, a yellow colouring agent from turmeric and capsaicin, a pungent principle of red pepper exhibit profound anticarcinogenic and antimutagenic activities. Two well-defined eukaryotic transcription factors, nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappaB) and activator protein 1 (AP-1) have been implicated in pathogenesis of many human diseases including cancer. These transcription factors are known to be activated by a wide array of external stimuli, such as tumor promoter 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA), tumor necrosis factor, reactive oxygen species, bacterial lipopolysaccharide, and ultraviolet. In the present study, we found that topical application of TPA onto dorsal skin of female ICR mice resulted in marked activation of epidermal NF-kappaB and AP-1. Curcumin and capsaicin, when topically applied prior to TPA, significantly attenuated TPA-induced activation of each transcription factor in mouse skin. Likewise, both compounds inhibited NF-kappaB and AP-1 activation in cultured human promyelocytic leukemia (HL-60) cells stimulated with TPA. Based on these findings, it is likely that curcumin and capsaicin exert anti-tumor promotional effects through suppression of the tumor promoter-induced activation of transcription factors, NF-kappaB and AP-1.","['Surh, Y J', 'Han, S S', 'Keum, Y S', 'Seo, H J', 'Lee, S S']","['Surh YJ', 'Han SS', 'Keum YS', 'Seo HJ', 'Lee SS']","['College of Pharmacy, Seoul National University, Kwanak-gu, Korea. surh@plaza.snu.ac.kr']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Biofactors,"BioFactors (Oxford, England)",8807441,"['0 (Anticarcinogenic Agents)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Transcription Factor AP-1)', 'IT942ZTH98 (Curcumin)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)', 'S07O44R1ZM (Capsaicin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Anticarcinogenic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Capsaicin/*pharmacology', 'Curcumin/*pharmacology', 'Female', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred ICR', 'NF-kappa B/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Skin/drug effects/metabolism', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/*pharmacology', 'Transcription Factor AP-1/*antagonists & inhibitors']",,2001/02/24 12:00,2001/04/21 10:01,['2001/02/24 12:00'],"['2001/02/24 12:00 [pubmed]', '2001/04/21 10:01 [medline]', '2001/02/24 12:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Biofactors. 2000;12(1-4):107-12. doi: 10.1002/biof.5520120117.,,,['10.1002/biof.5520120117 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

No evidence of GVT was appreciated for the mock-transfected breast cancer cell line as assessed by an absence of a statistically significant difference in survival between syngeneic and alloBMT groups. However, there was a highly statistically significant survival difference between allogeneic versus syngeneic bone marrow transplantation groups inoculated with the TGF-beta1 antisense-transfected cell line (P = .00001) as well as when comparing the survival of mice that received alloBMT for TGF-beta1 antisense-transfected tumor versus mock-transfected tumor (P = .0008).

LMWGs act as molecular switches for regulating a wide range of signal-transduction pathways in virtually all cells. In hematopoietic cells, LMWGs have been shown to participate in essential functions such as growth control, differentiation, cytoskeletal organization, cytokine and chemoattractant-induced signalling events, reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate oxidase activity, intracellular vesicle transport and secretion. In human leukemias, myelodysplastic syndromes and myeloproliferative disorders, Ras activation occurs by point mutations, overexpression or by alteration of NF-1 Ras-GTPase activating protein (GAP). These are postinitiation events in leukemia but may modulate growth-factor-dependent and independent leukemic growth. Two animal models of mutated N-ras expression resulting in myelodysplastic and myeloproliferative features are discussed. The role of Ras in organ development is discussed in the context of transgenic knockout mice.

Because of the impact of the test on decision-making in patient care, its accuracy is quite important. Detection of BCR-ABL mRNA by polymerase chain reaction, one of the most popular molecular diagnostic tests for hematological malignancies, has been used for diagnosis of Philadelphia-positive leukemias. Quality of the test must be assured in the process of diagnostic plan, sampling, measurement(nucleic acid isolation, amplification, detection), report and interpretation. Risk of false-positive results due to contamination of in vitro nucleic acid amplification reactions can be decreased through the use of protocols for contamination control. False-negative results may be caused by variability in BCR breakpoint, and loss or degradation of RNA due to inappropriate procedures as well as an insufficient detection sensitivity. Presence of inhibitors of amplification is also to be considered as a cause of false-negative results. Thus, quality control techniques such as internal standards are mandatory to ensure efficient amplification as well as RNA extraction. For the precise evaluation of minimal residual diseases, accurate and sensitive quantitative analyses are required. For quality assurance of assays in the present status of no commercially available kits, it is particularly important to monitor the clinical validation of the results by correlating them with the patient's status to prove clinically relevant. Staffs need to be trained to be familiar with both molecular pathogenesis and technology so that they can provide informative test results with a high quality.","['Miyachi, H']",['Miyachi H'],"['Department of Clinical Pathology, Tokai University School of Medicine, Isehara 259-1193.']",['jpn'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",Japan,Rinsho Byori,Rinsho byori.

Mainly, all kind (except frozen) of packed red cells (RBCs), platelet concentrates (random-donor buffy coat or apheresis donation), single-donor (apheresis) or random-donor (buffy coats) granulocytes, fresh frozen plasma (FFP), single-donor cryoprecipitate are prepared. Recently, fibrin glue (obtained by recycled cryoprecipitation from single-donor or autologous plasma), and some of new generation of blood components: hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (fresh or cryopreserved), collected from bone marrow or harvested from peripheral blood after mobilization and donor-specific mononuclear cells for cell therapy, i.e. immunomodulation during relapse of leukemia after bone marrow transplantation, have become the routine. Analysis of blood component therapy done at the MMA during the past 11 years (1989-1999) showed that: a) participation of WB transfusion in the group of surgical clinics was permanently decreased (from 59.60% in 1989 to 0.37% in 1999); b) WB transfusion (in the last few years) practically was not used in the group of internal medicine clinics (0.82% in 1993 and 0.45% in 1999); c) overall WB transfusion in MMA is extremely rare (0.37%).","['Taseski, J', 'Balint, B', 'Radovic, M']","['Taseski J', 'Balint B', 'Radovic M']",,['srp'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Serbia,Vojnosanit Pregl,Vojnosanitetski pregled,21530700R,,IM,"['Blood Component Removal/methods/statistics & numerical data', 'Blood Component Transfusion/*statistics & numerical data', 'Health Facilities', 'Humans', 'Military Medicine', 'Yugoslavia']",,2001/02/24 12:00,2001/03/17 10:01,['2001/02/24 12:00'],"['2001/02/24 12:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/17 10:01 [medline]', '2001/02/24 12:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Vojnosanit Pregl. 2000 Sep-Oct;57(5):17-27.,Usmerena hemoterapija u Vojnomedicinskoj akademiji--sadasnje mogucnosti.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We found that an oxidation-resistant type of vitamin C (Asc), Asc-2-O-phosphate (Asc2P), inhibited the invasion of the tax-transfected Rat-1 cells (W4 cells). Intracellular Asc (Ascin), after enzymatic dephosphorylation of administered Asc2P, was more abundant in W4 cells than in Rat-1 cells, and the ratio of dehydroascorbic acid versus Asc was increased in W4 cells but scarcely in Rat-1 cells, according to the enhanced level of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROSin) in W4 cells. Asc2P notably repressed the increases in both ROSin and secretion of matrix metalloproteases (MMPs), but did not affect Tax protein expression in tax-transfectants. NF-kappa B activation, as evidenced by its translocation to the nucleus in W4 cells, was also repressed by Asc2P. Thus, the tax-promoted invasion together with the enhanced production of MMPs occurred with NF-kappa B activation and the increase in ROSin, both of which were effectively reduced by Asc2P. These findings indicate the therapeutic efficacy of Ascin-enriching agents for the prevention against tumor invasion in which ROSin plays a major role.","['Nagao, N', 'Etoh, T', 'Yamaoka, S', 'Okamoto, T', 'Miwa, N']","['Nagao N', 'Etoh T', 'Yamaoka S', 'Okamoto T', 'Miwa N']","['Department of Cell Biochemistry, Hiroshima Prefectural University School of BioSciences, Hiroshima 727-0023, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Antioxid Redox Signal,Antioxidants & redox signaling,100888899,"['0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '23313-12-4 (ascorbate-2-phosphate)', 'PQ6CK8PD0R (Ascorbic Acid)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Ascorbic Acid/*analogs & derivatives/*pharmacology', 'Basement Membrane/cytology', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Movement/genetics/physiology', 'Fibroblasts/cytology/*drug effects/*metabolism', 'Gene Products, tax/*genetics', 'Genes, pX', 'Humans', 'NF-kappa B/*metabolism', 'Neoplasm Invasiveness/genetics/physiopathology', 'Oxidative Stress/drug effects', 'Phenotype', 'Rats', 'Transfection']",,2001/02/24 12:00,2001/03/10 10:01,['2001/02/24 12:00'],"['2001/02/24 12:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/10 10:01 [medline]', '2001/02/24 12:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Antioxid Redox Signal. 2000 Winter;2(4):727-38. doi: 10.1089/ars.2000.2.4-727.,,,['10.1089/ars.2000.2.4-727 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In addition to a 12-kDa intracellular form, extracellular 10-kDa and 12-kDa TRX have been defined. The biological activities of the 10-kDa TRX were previously measured as eosinophil cytotoxicity enhancing activity or B-cell stimulatory activity. Cytotrophoblastic cell lines also release a 10-kDa TRX form. To study the biological role of 10-kDa TRX, we established two highly sensitive enzyme-linked immuno-spot assays (ELISPOT), which detect secreted truncated 10-kDa and full-length 12-kDa TRX at the single cell level. TRX secretion was investigated in several cell lines including the T-helper cell hybridoma MP6, the Jurkat T-cell leukemia, the U-937 myelomonocytic leukemia, and the 3B6, EBV-transformed, lymphoblastoid B-cell line. The highest number of secreting cells was found in 3B6 cultures, median = 34 (quartiles, 27-39) per well (10(5) cells). Peripheral blood monocytes isolated from healthy donors secreted significantly more TRX after stimulation with ionomycin, phorbol myristate acetate (PMA), fMLP, and lipopolysaccharide (LPS), compared to unstimulated cells. Oxidative stress induced by thioloxidant diamide also induced the secretion of both truncated and full-length TRX measured in ELISPOT (p = 0.047 and p = 0.031, respectively). The biological activity of the truncated and full-length forms was tested in a cell migration assay. Truncated TRX was devoid of protein disulfide reductase activity, but retained strong chemoattractant activity for human monocytes, in the same range as full-length TRX, as previously reported (Bertini et al., 1999).","['Sahaf, B', 'Rosen, A']","['Sahaf B', 'Rosen A']","['Department of Biomedicine and Surgery, Division of Cell Biology, Linkoping University, S-581 85 Linkoping, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Antioxid Redox Signal,Antioxidants & redox signaling,100888899,"['0 (Antioxidants)', '0 (Oxidants)', '10465-78-8 (Diamide)', '52500-60-4 (Thioredoxins)']",IM,"['Antioxidants/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Transformed', 'Chemotaxis, Leukocyte', 'Diamide/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Leukocytes/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Molecular Weight', 'Monocytes/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Oxidants/toxicity', 'Oxidative Stress', 'Thioredoxins/*blood/chemistry/*metabolism', 'U937 Cells']",,2001/02/24 12:00,2001/03/10 10:01,['2001/02/24 12:00'],"['2001/02/24 12:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/10 10:01 [medline]', '2001/02/24 12:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Antioxid Redox Signal. 2000 Winter;2(4):717-26. doi: 10.1089/ars.2000.2.4-717.,,,['10.1089/ars.2000.2.4-717 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Each nuclide was administered intraperitoneally in citrate solution to three groups of adult male CBA/H mice at levels of activity which gave estimated life-time average skeletal doses of about 0.25-0.3 Gy, 0.5-1 Gy and 1-2 Gy. Animals were carefully monitored and sacrificed as soon as they showed signs of ill health; tumours were identified by standard histopathological techniques. RESULTS: Statistical modelling by Cox regression showed that, considering all three nuclides together, there was a highly significant increase in risk of death from osteosarcoma or myeloid leukaemia with increasing dose rate. For osteosarcoma, the effect was significantly greater for 239Pu than 241Am, while separate analysis for 233U showed no significant increase with increasing dose rate. For example, the increase in relative risk of death from osteosarcoma for an increase in life-time average dose rate to bone of 1 mGyd(-1) was 4.2 (2.7-6.5) for 239Pu, 2.3 (1.4-3.4) for 241Am and 1.1 (0.4-3.1) for 233U. For myeloid leukaemia, there was no significant difference between 239Pu and 241Am in the effect of dose rate. The increase in relative risk from myeloid leukaemia for an increase in average dose rate of 1 mGyd(-1) was 1.8 (1.1-2.8) for 239Pu, 2.0 (1.4-2.9) for 241Am and 1.5 (0.8-2.7) for 233U. Significant increases in renal and hepatic carcinomas were also recorded in animals exposed to 233U and 241Am, respectively. Studies of the distribution of the nuclides within the skeleton, published separately, have shown differences in their retention in individual bones and within bone. The proportions of decays occurring near to endosteal bone surfaces and throughout bone marrow were in the order: 239Pu> 241Am>233U. CONCLUSIONS: For osteosarcoma, the relative effectiveness of the nuclides in terms of average bone dose, in the order 239Pu>241Am>233U, is consistent with the proportion of dose delivered near to endosteal surfaces. For myeloid leukaemia, the greater effectiveness of 239Pu and 241Am than 233U is consistent with their accumulation in marrow.","['Ellender, M', 'Harrison, J D', 'Pottinger, H', 'Thomas, J M']","['Ellender M', 'Harrison JD', 'Pottinger H', 'Thomas JM']","['National Radiological Protection Board, Didcot, Oxon, UK. michele.ellender@nrpb.org.uk']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Int J Radiat Biol,International journal of radiation biology,8809243,"['0 (Radioisotopes)', '4OC371KSTK (Uranium)', '53023GN24M (Plutonium)', 'VW92PHU2UY (Americium)']",IM,"['Americium/*adverse effects', 'Animals', 'Bone and Bones/radiation effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Radiation', 'Female', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*etiology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred CBA', 'Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced/*etiology', 'Osteosarcoma/*etiology', 'Plutonium/*adverse effects', 'Radioisotopes/*adverse effects', 'Regression Analysis', 'Time Factors', 'Tissue Distribution', 'Uranium/*adverse effects']",,2001/02/24 12:00,2001/03/07 10:01,['2001/02/24 12:00'],"['2001/02/24 12:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/07 10:01 [medline]', '2001/02/24 12:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Int J Radiat Biol. 2001 Jan;77(1):41-52. doi: 10.1080/095530001453104.,,,['10.1080/095530001453104 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

MATERIALS AND METHODS: CBA/H, (CBA/H x C57BL/6)F1, F1 x CBA/H, F1 x C57BL/6 and F1 x F1 mice were exposed to a single acute dose of 3.0 Gy X-rays. AML and TL were diagnosed over the subsequent 30 months. RESULTS: There was no statistically significant difference in the incidence of AML in F1, F1 x F1, F1 x CBA/H and F1 x C57BL/6 mice, which was approximately 50% that in CBA/H mice. AML susceptibility is therefore a dominant polygenic trait, and both susceptibility and resistance (variable penetrance) CBA/H and C57BL/6 loci are involved. The incidence of TL in the FM and F1 x CBA/H mice was negligible, indicating that TL susceptibility is a recessive trait. As the TL incidence in the F1 x C57BL/6 mice was about half that in C57BL/6 mice, one recessive locus is probably involved. CONCLUSIONS: AML susceptibility in CBA/H mice is a dominant trait in contrast to the recessive inheritance of CBA/H sensitivity to radiation-induced chromosomal instability.

Here, we report on the possible role of cytokines in the mechanism underlying this GVL effect. METHODS: Splenic mRNA levels of the cytokines interleukin (IL)-1, IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-7, IL-10, IL-12, IL-15, interferon-gamma, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, and transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta), and of inducible nitric oxide synthetase were determined by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction in TLI/TBI- or TBI-conditioned C3H/AKR BM chimeras challenged with AKR-type BW5147.3 leukemia cells. Ex vivo TGF-beta protein production by splenocytes was determined using ELISA. The possibility that cytokines influence the GVL effect by modulating the activity of IL-2-activated lymphocytes (LAK cells) was investigated by in vitro assays on donor-type BM cells. RESULTS: Of all cytokine mRNA levels studied, those of TGF-beta and IL-7 were different between groups; both were significantly more elevated in TBI- than in TLI/ TBI-conditioned or normal mice. Differences were apparent after conditioning and were not influenced by additionally injected BM or leukemia cells. Cultured splenocytes of TBI-conditioned animals produced significantly more TGF-beta protein than those of TLI/TBI-conditioned ones or normal controls. r-TGF-beta but not r-IL-7 suppressed in vitro LAK activity of donor-type BM cells against BW5147.3 cells in a dose-dependent way. CONCLUSIONS: High-dose TBI-induced, host-derived splenic TGF-beta may inhibit generation of LAK cells from subsequently transplanted donor BM cells, suppressing their capacity to generate cytotoxicity upon injection of leukemia cells. The cytokine profile, induced by irradiation in host hematopoietic organs, can significantly modify posttransplant immunological processes such as the GVL effect and graft-versus-host disease (GVHD).","['Billiau, A D', 'Sefrioui, H', 'Overbergh, L', 'Rutgeerts, O', 'Goebels, J', 'Mathieu, C', 'Waer, M']","['Billiau AD', 'Sefrioui H', 'Overbergh L', 'Rutgeerts O', 'Goebels J', 'Mathieu C', 'Waer M']","['Laboratory of Experimental Transplantation, Catholic University of Leuven, Belgium.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Transplantation,Transplantation,0132144,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Interleukin-7)', '0 (Lymphotoxin-alpha)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Bone Marrow Cells/*cytology/radiation effects', 'Cytokines/genetics', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic/*drug effects', 'Graft vs Leukemia Effect/radiation effects', 'Interleukin-7/pharmacology', 'Killer Cells, Lymphokine-Activated/*drug effects/immunology', 'Killer Cells, Natural/immunology', 'Leukemia/immunology/pathology', 'Lymphotoxin-alpha/blood/pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred AKR', 'Mice, Inbred C3H', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Radiation Chimera', 'Spleen/chemistry', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/*pharmacology', 'Whole-Body Irradiation']",,2001/02/24 12:00,2001/03/10 10:01,['2001/02/24 12:00'],"['2001/02/24 12:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/10 10:01 [medline]', '2001/02/24 12:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Transplantation. 2001 Jan 27;71(2):292-9. doi: 10.1097/00007890-200101270-00022.,,,['10.1097/00007890-200101270-00022 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Donor germ cells were harvested from the testes of terminally ill leukemic rats and were either used directly or cryopreserved and thawed before transplantation by rete testis microinjection. All rats transplanted with testicular cells from leukemic donors developed signs of terminal rat T-cell leukemia, whereas control animals remained healthy. Cryopreservation of the donor germ cells caused a 3- to 6-day delay in the terminal phase of leukemia. When a known number of leukemic cells were mixed with germ cells and microinjected into the testis, the rate of appearance of terminal leukemia was directly related to the number of transferred leukemic lymphoblasts. As few as 20 leukemic cells were able to cause a cancer relapse resulting in terminal leukemia 21 days after transplantation in three of five transplanted animals. Our results demonstrate that germ cell transplantation with the presently used techniques is not safe enough for clinical use. Improved methods for purging testicular specimens of cancer cells or totally new approaches with transient xenogenetic host models to detect contamination of malignant cells must be developed before this technique can be offered to patients without fear of disease relapse.","['Jahnukainen, K', 'Hou, M', 'Petersen, C', 'Setchell, B', 'Soder, O']","['Jahnukainen K', 'Hou M', 'Petersen C', 'Setchell B', 'Soder O']","['Pediatric Endocrinology Unit, Karolinska Institute, Karolinska Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden. kirsi.Jahnukainen@hus.fi']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,,IM,"['Animals', '*Cell Transplantation/adverse effects', 'Cryopreservation', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/etiology/mortality/*pathology', 'Male', 'Rats', 'Spermatogonia/cytology/transplantation', 'Spermatozoa/cytology/transplantation', 'Survival Rate', 'Testis/cytology/*transplantation']",,2001/02/24 12:00,2001/03/03 10:01,['2001/02/24 12:00'],"['2001/02/24 12:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/03 10:01 [medline]', '2001/02/24 12:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 2001 Jan 15;61(2):706-10.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, ATRA metabolism appears to be involved in the growth inhibition of several cancer cell lines in vitro. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the in vitro activity of the principal metabolites of ATRA [4-hydroxy-retinoic acid (4-OH-RA), 18-hydroxy-retinoic acid (18-OH-RA), 4-oxo-retinoic acid (4-oxo-RA), and 5,6-epoxy-retinoic acid (5,6-epoxy-RA)] in NB4, a human promyelocytic leukemia cell line that exhibits the APL diagnostic t(15;17) chromosomal translocation and expresses the PML-RAR alpha fusion protein. We established that the four ATRA metabolites were indeed formed by the NB4 cells in vitro. NB4 cell growth was inhibited (69-78% at 120 h) and cell cycle progression in the G1 phase (82-85% at 120 h) was blocked by ATRA and all of the metabolites at 1 microM concentration. ATRA and its metabolites could induce NB4 cells differentiation with similar activity, as evaluated by cell morphology, by the nitroblue tetrazolium reduction test (82-88% at 120 h) or by the expression of the maturation specific cell surface marker CD11c. In addition, nuclear body reorganization to macropunctated structures, as well as the degradation of PML-RAR alpha, was found to be similar for ATRA and all of its metabolites. Comparison of the relative potency of the retinoids using the nitroblue tetrazolium reduction test showed effective concentrations required to differentiate 50% of cells in 72 h as follows: ATRA, 15.8 +/- 1.7 nM; 4-oxo-RA, 38.3 +/- 1.3 nM; 18-OH-RA, 55.5 +/- 1.8 nM; 4-OH-RA, 79.8 +/- 1.8 nM; and 5,6-epoxy-RA, 99.5 +/- 1.5 nM. The ATRA metabolites were found to exert their differentiation effects via the RAR alpha nuclear receptors, because the RAR alpha-specific antagonist BMS614 blocked metabolite-induced CD11c expression in NB4 cells. These data demonstrate that the principal ATRA Phase 1 metabolites can elicit leukemia cell growth inhibition and differentiation in vitro through the RAR alpha signaling pathway, and they suggest that these metabolites may play a role in ATRA antileukemic activity in vivo.","['Idres, N', 'Benoit, G', 'Flexor, M A', 'Lanotte, M', 'Chabot, G G']","['Idres N', 'Benoit G', 'Flexor MA', 'Lanotte M', 'Chabot GG']","[""Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale U496, Institut Universitaire d'Hematologie (Universite Paris 7), H pital Saint-Louis (AP-HP), France.""]",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Integrin alphaXbeta2)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (RARA protein, human)', '0 (Receptors, Retinoic Acid)', '0 (Retinoic Acid Receptor alpha)', '0 (promyelocytic leukemia-retinoic acid receptor alpha fusion oncoprotein)', '13100-69-1 (5,6-epoxyretinoic acid)', '38030-57-8 (4-oxoretinoic acid)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', '66592-72-1 (4-hydroxyretinoic acid)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Granulocytes/cytology/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Integrin alphaXbeta2/drug effects/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/metabolism/pathology/*prevention & control', 'Neoplasm Proteins/drug effects/metabolism', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/drug effects/metabolism', 'Receptors, Retinoic Acid/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Retinoic Acid Receptor alpha', 'Time Factors', 'Tretinoin/*analogs & derivatives/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,2001/02/24 12:00,2001/03/03 10:01,['2001/02/24 12:00'],"['2001/02/24 12:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/03 10:01 [medline]', '2001/02/24 12:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 2001 Jan 15;61(2):700-5.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Two of these, cyclin E and cyclin A2 (also known as cyclin A), are overexpressed in many cancers. Cyclin E2 and cyclin A1 are recently discovered cdk2-interacting cyclins that are found in malignant tumor cell lines and in acute myeloid leukemia, respectively. Expression and prognostic role of these cyclins in solid tumors is unknown. Here, we have analyzed expression and prognostic relevance of the cdk2-associated cyclins in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Fresh-frozen biopsies (n = 70) from completely resected tumors with stage I to IIIA NSCLC were studied. Gene expression was analyzed by quantitative real-time reverse transcription-PCR. Expression levels of cyclin E (P = 0.04) and cyclin A2 (P = 0.004) were significantly higher in the tumor samples than in normal controls. Cyclin A1, cyclin A2, and cyclin E2 expression levels did not have prognostic relevance for survival. The mean survival time associated with low and high levels of cyclin E was 69.4 and 47.2 months, respectively, which was statistically significant (P = 0.03). Differences in survival were particularly pronounced in stages I and II. Cyclin E was also closely associated with the development of distant metastasis (P = 0.01). Finally, we confirmed by immunohistochemistry analyses that cyclin E mRNA expression was closely associated with cyclin E protein expression. In conclusion, cyclin E is a strong independent prognostic indicator in patients with early-stage NSCLC, whereas cyclin E2, cyclin A1, and cyclin A2 do not have a prognostic role in NSCLC.","['Muller-Tidow, C', 'Metzger, R', 'Kugler, K', 'Diederichs, S', 'Idos, G', 'Thomas, M', 'Dockhorn-Dworniczak, B', 'Schneider, P M', 'Koeffler, H P', 'Berdel, W E', 'Serve, H']","['Muller-Tidow C', 'Metzger R', 'Kugler K', 'Diederichs S', 'Idos G', 'Thomas M', 'Dockhorn-Dworniczak B', 'Schneider PM', 'Koeffler HP', 'Berdel WE', 'Serve H']","['Department of Medicine, Hematology and Oncology, University of Munster, Germany. muellerc@uni-muenster.de']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Cyclin E)', '0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (CDC2-CDC28 Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (CDK2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 2)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinases)']",IM,"['Adult', '*CDC2-CDC28 Kinases', 'Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung/genetics/metabolism/*pathology', 'Cyclin E/*genetics/metabolism', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 2', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinases/*metabolism', 'DNA, Complementary/genetics', 'Data Interpretation, Statistical', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Lung Neoplasms/genetics/metabolism/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Prognosis', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/*metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Survival Analysis', 'U937 Cells']",,2001/02/24 12:00,2001/03/03 10:01,['2001/02/24 12:00'],"['2001/02/24 12:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/03 10:01 [medline]', '2001/02/24 12:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 2001 Jan 15;61(2):647-53.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, we used a series of camptothecin (CPT)-resistant cell lines with known top1 alterations. We show that three mutations in different domains of the top1 enzyme that confer CPT resistance also confer cross-resistance to NB-506. The CPT-resistant cell lines and corresponding mutations were: human prostate carcinoma cells DU-145/RC1 (mutation R364H), Chinese hamster fibroblasts DC3F/C10 (mutation G503S), and human leukemia CEM/C2 cells (N722S). This result suggests that NB-506 and CPT share a common binding site in the top1-DNA complex. We next used these three cell lines and their parental cells to study the relationship between top1 poisoning by NB-506 and antiproliferative activity. We found that the CPT-resistant cells were only 2-10-fold resistant to NB-506, which suggests that NB-506 targets other cellular processes/pathways besides top1. This conclusion was further supported by the limited cross-resistance of top1-deficient murine leukemia P388/CPT45 cells (2-fold). Cross-resistance was also limited for J-109,382, an isomer of NB-506 that does not intercalate into DNA, indicating that the non-top1-mediated antiproliferative activity of NB-506 is not attributable to DNA intercalation. Together, these data indicate that NB-506 and indolocarbazoles are promising agents to overcome CPT resistance.","['Urasaki, Y', 'Laco, G', 'Takebayashi, Y', 'Bailly, C', 'Kohlhagen, G', 'Pommier, Y']","['Urasaki Y', 'Laco G', 'Takebayashi Y', 'Bailly C', 'Kohlhagen G', 'Pommier Y']","['Division of Basic Sciences, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland 20892-4255, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Carbazoles)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Glucosides)', '0 (Intercalating Agents)', '0 (NB 506)', 'EC 5.99.1.2 (DNA Topoisomerases, Type I)', 'XT3Z54Z28A (Camptothecin)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Binding Sites', 'Camptothecin/*pharmacology', 'Carbazoles/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'DNA Topoisomerases, Type I/genetics/metabolism/*physiology', 'DNA, Neoplasm/drug effects/genetics/metabolism', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Glucosides/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Intercalating Agents/pharmacology', 'Mutation', 'Stereoisomerism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,2001/02/24 12:00,2001/03/03 10:01,['2001/02/24 12:00'],"['2001/02/24 12:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/03 10:01 [medline]', '2001/02/24 12:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 2001 Jan 15;61(2):504-8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: A retrospective evaluation of an oral desensitization regimen using gradual dosage-escalation of allopurinol in 32 patients (30 with gout and 2 with chronic lymphocytic leukemia) whose therapy was interrupted because of a pruritic cutaneous reaction to the drug. RESULTS: Twenty-one men and 11 women with a mean age of 63 years (range 17-83 years), a mean serum urate level of 618 micromoles/liter (range 495-750) (or, mean 10.4 mg/dl [range 8.3-12.6]), and a mean serum creatinine level of 249 micromoles/liter (range 75-753) (or, mean 2.8 mg/dl [range 0.8-8.5]) were studied. Desensitization failed in 4 patients because of unmanageable recurrent rash. Twenty-eight patients completed the desensitization procedure to a target allopurinol dosage of 50-100 mg/day, 21 without deviation from the protocol for a mean of 30.5 days (range 21-56 days) and 7 requiring dosage adjustments because of a recurrent rash over 53.8 days (range 40-189 days). Seven of these 28 patients developed late cutaneous reactions 1-20 months postdesensitization, 4 responding to dosage modification and 3 discontinuing the drug. Twenty-five of the 32 patients (78%) continued to take allopurinol; their mean duration of followup was 32.6 months (range 3-92 months) and the mean postdesensitization serum urate level was 318 micromoles/liter (range 187-452) (or, mean 5.3 mg/dl [range 3.0-7.5]). CONCLUSION: The study confirms the long-term efficacy and safety of slow oral desensitization to allopurinol in patients with maculopapular eruptions, particularly in those with gout, who cannot be treated with uricosurics or other urate-lowering drugs. Although pruritic skin eruptions may recur both during and after desensitization, most of these cutaneous reactions can be managed by temporary withdrawal of allopurinol and dosage adjustment.","['Fam, A G', 'Dunne, S M', 'Iazzetta, J', 'Paton, T W']","['Fam AG', 'Dunne SM', 'Iazzetta J', 'Paton TW']","['Sunnybrook Health Science Centre, University of Toronto, Ontario, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Arthritis Rheum,Arthritis and rheumatism,0370605,"['0 (Gout Suppressants)', '63CZ7GJN5I (Allopurinol)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Allopurinol/*adverse effects/*immunology', 'Desensitization, Immunologic', 'Drug Eruptions/*etiology', 'Female', 'Gout Suppressants/adverse effects/immunology', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged']",,2001/02/24 12:00,2001/03/10 10:01,['2001/02/24 12:00'],"['2001/02/24 12:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/10 10:01 [medline]', '2001/02/24 12:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Arthritis Rheum. 2001 Jan;44(1):231-8. doi: 10.1002/1529-0131(200101)44:1<231::AID-ANR30>3.0.CO;2-7.,,,['10.1002/1529-0131(200101)44:1<231::AID-ANR30>3.0.CO;2-7 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

RA-induced myeloid differentiation and G1/G0 growth arrest of HL-60 cells is known to require the activation of the RARalpha and RXR retinoid receptors, as well as activation of the MAPK, ERK2. Transcriptional activation of the Burkitt's lymphoma receptor 1 (blr1) gene occurs early during RA-induced differentiation of HL-60 cells and requires these same three activating processes. The use of retinoid ligands that activate either the RARalpha or the RXR retinoid receptors revealed that blr1 mRNA induction was detectable only when both RARalpha and RXR were activated. Neither the RARalpha nor RXR selective ligands alone induced expression of blr1, but the combination of the two ligands induced the expression of blr1 to the same extent as RA. The MAPKK (MEK) inhibitor, PD98059, was used to determine whether extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK2) activation was necessary for induction of blr1 mRNA. PD98059 inhibited induced blr1 mRNA expression, due to RA or activated RARalpha plus RXR ligands, indicating that ERK2 activation is necessary for blr1 mRNA expression. Previous studies showed that ectopic expression of blr1 also caused increased MAPK activation, in particular ERK2, and subsequently accelerated RA-induced differentiation and G1/G0 growth arrest. Inhibition of ERK2 activation inhibited differentiation of blr1 transfectants, suggesting that the accelerated differentiation reflected blr1-enhanced ERK2 activation.

Apoptosis is an important mechanism whereby chemotherapeutics exhibit their anti-oncogenic activity. Although, some lipid analogues were used in clinical trials, they exert severe side effects and their mechanism of action is widely unknown. We present here a new class of synthetic alkylphosphocholines (APC) that induce programmed cell death in leukaemia cells. The signs of apoptosis arise after 1 h of incubation with these compounds as shown by phosphatidylserine externalisation followed by caspase activation and DNA fragmentation. We demonstrate that the molecular target of these lipids is upstream of caspases and Bcl-2.

The CD23 and FMC-7 antigen, along with the CD5 coexpression pattern, permitted accurate classification of all 71 cases of small lymphocytic, mantle cell, and marginal zone types of lymphoma. The widest variation of patterns was with follicular cell lymphoma, although most cases expressed the CD23 +/-/FMC-7+ pattern (+/-, partial or minor subset expression).

The tumors appear spontaneously in a hamster colony bred in Berlin-Buch (HaB). Virus particles isolated from skin epitheliomas cause lymphoma and leukemia when injected into newborn hamsters from a distinct colony bred in Potsdam, Germany (HaP). The viral genome has been totally sequenced and the overall genetic organization establishes HaPV as a member of the polyomaviruses. HaPV is a second example of an middle T (MT) antigen encoding polyomavirus and nucleotide sequence homologies designates the mouse polyomavirus (Py) as the closest relative. Lymphomas induced by HaPV in HaP hamsters do not contain virus particles but instead accumulate different amounts of nonrandomly deleted free and/or integrated viral genomes. Transgenic mice produced by microinjection of HaPV DNA into the pronucleus of fertilized eggs of Gat: NMRI mice developed both, epitheliomas and lymphomas. Both tumor types contain extrachromosomal DNA. HaPV DNA was found to replicate in hamster lymphoid and fibroblast cell lines. Fully reproductive cycles could be detected only in GD36 lymphoblastic leukemia cells. HaPV carries the full transforming properties of a polyomavirus in vitro. Immortalization of primary rat cells is essentially carried out by the HaPV large T (LT) antigen and coexpression of HaPV MT and HaPV small T (ST) antigen is required for full transformation of rat fibroblasts. The preferential binding of HaPV MT to c-Fyn, a Src family kinase, has been proposed as a mechanism leading to lymphoid malignancies. Heterologous expression of HaPV-VP1 allowed the formation of virus like particles (VLPs) resembling HaPV particles. The high flexibility of HaPV-VP1 for insertion of foreign peptides offers a broad range of potential applications, especially in vaccine development.","['Scherneck, S', 'Ulrich, R', 'Feunteun, J']","['Scherneck S', 'Ulrich R', 'Feunteun J']","['Max Delbruck Center for Molecular Medicine, Berlin, Germany. sschern@mdc-berlin.de']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Virus Genes,Virus genes,8803967,,IM,"['Animals', 'Cricetinae', 'Mesocricetus', 'Mice', 'Papilloma/*virology', 'Polyomavirus/*pathogenicity/*physiology', 'Polyomavirus Infections/*virology', 'Tumor Virus Infections/*virology']",46,2001/02/24 12:00,2001/08/24 10:01,['2001/02/24 12:00'],"['2001/02/24 12:00 [pubmed]', '2001/08/24 10:01 [medline]', '2001/02/24 12:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Virus Genes. 2001 Jan;22(1):93-101. doi: 10.1023/a:1008190504521.,,,['10.1023/a:1008190504521 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This second-generation platinum drug has less nephrotoxicity and ototoxicity but more myelotoxicity than does the first-generation platinum drug cisplatin. The study was designed to elucidate whether their myelosuppressive activities equal their antileukemic effects. METHODS: Cisplatin and carboplatin were used to treat four leukemic cell lines (CEM, HL60, K562 and U937), blast cells from 10 leukemic patients and hematopoietic progenitors from five umbilical cord blood samples. RESULTS: The mean IC50 of leukemic cell lines was 0.4 and 6.2 microg/ml, the mean IC50 of patients' leukemic blasts was 2.0 and 22.4 microg/ml and the mean IC50 of hematopoietic progenitors (BFU-E, CFU-E and CFU-GM) was 1.8 and 1.7 microg/ml for cisplatin and carboplatin, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Carboplatin required a 10 times higher drug concentration than cisplatin to induce a similar degree of growth inhibition on leukemic cells. However, the hematopoietic progenitors responded equally to cisplatin and carboplatin at the same drug concentration. The results suggest that the myelosuppressive activity of carboplatin is greater than its antileukemic effect.","['Su, W C', 'Chang, S L', 'Chen, T Y', 'Chen, J S', 'Tsao, C J']","['Su WC', 'Chang SL', 'Chen TY', 'Chen JS', 'Tsao CJ']","['Department of Internal Medicine, National Cheng Kung University Hospital, Tainan, Taiwan. sunnysu@mail.ncku.edu.tw']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Jpn J Clin Oncol,Japanese journal of clinical oncology,0313225,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', 'BG3F62OND5 (Carboplatin)', 'Q20Q21Q62J (Cisplatin)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Bone Marrow/*drug effects', 'Carboplatin/*pharmacology', 'Cisplatin/*pharmacology', 'Growth Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'HL-60 Cells/drug effects', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells/drug effects', 'Leukemia/*pathology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects']",,2001/02/24 12:00,2001/03/03 10:01,['2001/02/24 12:00'],"['2001/02/24 12:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/03 10:01 [medline]', '2001/02/24 12:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Jpn J Clin Oncol. 2000 Dec;30(12):562-7. doi: 10.1093/jjco/hyd137.,,,['10.1093/jjco/hyd137 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In addition, their survival is critically dependent on hemopoietic growth factors. We therefore compared the effects of Steel factor (SF) and GM-CSF on the survival, proliferation, and differentiation of primary human CD34+ cells, as well as the role of SCL during these processes. GM-CSF suppresses apoptosis in CD34+ cells, which proliferate and differentiate into mature granulocytic and monocytic cells (CD34-CD13+) and loose SCL expression. In contrast, SF suppresses apoptosis without a significant increase in cell numbers, and the cells remain CD34+ and SCL+ with a blast-like morphology. Examination of apoptosis by the terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase mediated dUTP-biotin nick end labeling (TUNEL) reaction and of the cell cycle status indicated that SF is both a survival factor and a mitogenic factor for CD34+ cells. There was, however, constant cell death in a fraction of the population, which could be rescued by GM-CSF. Co-addition of SF and GM-CSF prevents the downregulation of SCL observed in the presence of GM-CSF by itself, allows for prolonged survival and expansion of CD34+ cells in culture, inhibits monocytic differentiation and impairs granulocytic differentiation. Finally, exposure to an antisense SCL but not a control oligonucleotide decreases SCL protein levels and prevents the suppression of apoptosis by SF without affecting GM-CSF-dependent cell survival. These observations suggest that the hemopoietic transcription factor SCL regulates the survival of CD34+ cells in response to SF.","['Caceres-Cortes, J R', 'Krosl, G', 'Tessier, N', 'Hugo, P', 'Hoang, T']","['Caceres-Cortes JR', 'Krosl G', 'Tessier N', 'Hugo P', 'Hoang T']","['Laboratory of Hemopoiesis and Leukemia and Clinical Research Institute of Montreal, Montreal, Quebec, Canada. cortesj@servidor.unam.mx']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Stem Cells,"Stem cells (Dayton, Ohio)",9304532,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Oligoribonucleotides, Antisense)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Stem Cell Factor)', '0 (T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '135471-20-4 (TAL1 protein, human)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD34/*analysis', 'Apoptosis/drug effects/immunology', 'Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects/immunology', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Survival/drug effects/immunology', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics/immunology', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/pharmacology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology/immunology/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'In Situ Nick-End Labeling', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Oligoribonucleotides, Antisense/pharmacology', '*Proto-Oncogene Proteins', 'Stem Cell Factor/immunology/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1', '*Transcription Factors']",,2001/02/24 11:00,2001/05/26 10:01,['2001/02/24 11:00'],"['2001/02/24 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/05/26 10:01 [medline]', '2001/02/24 11:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Stem Cells. 2001;19(1):59-70. doi: 10.1634/stemcells.19-1-59.,,,['10.1634/stemcells.19-1-59 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Retroviral vectors are extensively used for HSC gene therapy. However, the initial human trials of HSC gene marking and therapy showed that the gene transfer efficiency into human HSCs with retroviral vectors was very low in contrast to the much higher efficiency observed in murine experiments. The more quiescent nature of human HSCs and the lower density of retroviral receptors on them hindered the efficient gene transfer with retroviral vectors. Since nonhuman primates have marked similarity to humans in all aspects including the HSC biology, their models are considered to be important to evaluate and improve gene transfer into human HSCs. Using these models, clinically relevant levels (around 10% or even more) of gene-modified cells in peripheral blood have recently been achieved after gene transfer into HSCs and their autologous transplantation. This has been made possible by improving ex vivo transduction conditions such as introduction of Flt-3 ligand and specific fibronectin fragment (CH-296) into ex vivo culture during transduction, and the use of retroviral vectors pseudotyped with the gibbon ape leukemia virus or feline endogenous retrovirus envelope. Other strategies including the use of lentiviral vectors and in vivo selective expansion of gene-modified cells with the drug resistance gene or selective amplifier gene (also designated the molecular growth switch) are now being tested to further increase the fraction of gene-modified cells using nonhuman primate models. In addition to the high gene transfer efficiency, high-level and long-term expression of transgenes in human HSCs and their progeny is also required for effective HSC gene therapy. For this purpose, other backbones of retroviral vectors such as the murine stem cell virus and cis-DNA elements, such as the ss-globin locus control region and the chromatin insulator, also need to be tested in nonhuman primate models. Nonhuman primate studies will continue to provide an important framework for human HSC gene therapy. Well-designed nonhuman primate studies will also offer unique insights into the HSCs, immune system, and transplantation biology characteristic of large animals.","['Hanazono, Y', 'Terao, K', 'Ozawa, K']","['Hanazono Y', 'Terao K', 'Ozawa K']","['Division of Genetic Therapeutics, Center for Molecular Medicine, Jichi Medical School, Tochigi, Japan. hanazono@jichi.ac.jp']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Stem Cells,"Stem cells (Dayton, Ohio)",9304532,,IM,"['Animals', '*Gene Transfer Techniques', 'Genetic Therapy/*methods', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cells', 'Humans', '*Macaca fascicularis']",145,2001/02/24 11:00,2001/05/26 10:01,['2001/02/24 11:00'],"['2001/02/24 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/05/26 10:01 [medline]', '2001/02/24 11:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Stem Cells. 2001;19(1):12-23. doi: 10.1634/stemcells.19-1-12.,,,['10.1634/stemcells.19-1-12 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We also describe assays for characterization of AML progenitor subsets (i.e., suspension cultures, colony assays, long-term in vitro culture, xenotransplantation in immunocompromised mice), and we discuss the possible use of AML cell lines as experimental models in AML. Furthermore, clinical studies suggest that the in vitro growth characteristics of AML blasts assayed by short-term culture of the total native populations can be used as a predictor of prognosis after intensive chemotherapy. These in vitro assays may therefore be used for more accurate identification of prognostic parameters and thereby form a basis for the development of simplified laboratory techniques suitable for routine evaluation of patients undergoing risk-adapted therapy.

A population-based study of cancer incidence in A-T families with unbiased selection and tracing of relatives would confirm this hypothesis. METHODS: We conducted a study in the Nordic countries of 1218 blood relatives of 56 A-T patients from 50 families. The relatives were identified from population registries, and the occurrence of cancer was determined from cancer registry files in each country and compared with national incidence rates. All statistical tests were two-sided. RESULTS: Among the 56 patients with A-T, we observed six cases of cancer (four leukemias and two non-Hodgkin's lymphomas) compared with 0.16 expected, yielding a standardized incidence ratio (SIR) of 37 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 13 to 80). Among the 1218 relatives, 150 cancers were recorded, with 126 expected (SIR = 1.19; 95% CI = 1.01 to 1.40). Invasive breast cancer occurred in 21 female relatives of A-T patients (SIR = 1.54; 95% CI = 0.95 to 2.36), including five of the 50 mothers (all of whom are obligate ATM mutation carriers) (SIR = 7.1; 95% CI = 2.3 to 17). Relatives who were less likely to be carriers of a mutant ATM allele had no increase or only a modest, statistically nonsignificant increase in the risk of breast cancer. There was no evidence of increased risk for cancer at any other site. CONCLUSIONS: We confirmed the previously recognized high risk of lymphoma and leukemia in A-T patients. Our data are also consistent with an increased risk of breast cancer among blood relatives of A-T patients. The epidemiologic findings suggest, however, that, even if ATM mutations are responsible for some breast cancer cases, ATM is a relatively weak genetic risk factor for the disease.","['Olsen, J H', 'Hahnemann, J M', 'Borresen-Dale, A L', 'Brondum-Nielsen, K', 'Hammarstrom, L', 'Kleinerman, R', 'Kaariainen, H', 'Lonnqvist, T', 'Sankila, R', 'Seersholm, N', 'Tretli, S', 'Yuen, J', 'Boice, J D Jr', 'Tucker, M']","['Olsen JH', 'Hahnemann JM', 'Borresen-Dale AL', 'Brondum-Nielsen K', 'Hammarstrom L', 'Kleinerman R', 'Kaariainen H', 'Lonnqvist T', 'Sankila R', 'Seersholm N', 'Tretli S', 'Yuen J', 'Boice JD Jr', 'Tucker M']","['Institute of Cancer Epidemiology, Danish Cancer Society, Copenhagen, Denmark. jorgen@cancer.dk']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Natl Cancer Inst,Journal of the National Cancer Institute,7503089,,IM,"['Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Ataxia Telangiectasia/*complications/genetics', 'Breast Neoplasms/epidemiology/genetics', 'Consanguinity', 'Female', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Heterozygote', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Mutation', 'Neoplasms/*epidemiology/*genetics', 'Odds Ratio', 'Population Surveillance', 'Registries', 'Risk Factors', 'Scandinavian and Nordic Countries/epidemiology']",,2001/02/24 11:00,2001/04/03 10:01,['2001/02/24 11:00'],"['2001/02/24 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/04/03 10:01 [medline]', '2001/02/24 11:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Natl Cancer Inst. 2001 Jan 17;93(2):121-7. doi: 10.1093/jnci/93.2.121.,,,['10.1093/jnci/93.2.121 [doi]'],,"['N01CP61038/CP/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'N01CP91046/CP/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,['J Natl Cancer Inst. 2001 Jan 17;93(2):84-5.

These data provide novel evidence that leukemia, like certain other cancers, can arise as the result of chronic stimulation by a proinflammatory cytokine.","['Fehniger, T A', 'Suzuki, K', 'Ponnappan, A', 'VanDeusen, J B', 'Cooper, M A', 'Florea, S M', 'Freud, A G', 'Robinson, M L', 'Durbin, J', 'Caligiuri, M A']","['Fehniger TA', 'Suzuki K', 'Ponnappan A', 'VanDeusen JB', 'Cooper MA', 'Florea SM', 'Freud AG', 'Robinson ML', 'Durbin J', 'Caligiuri MA']","['Department of Internal Medicine, The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio 43210, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Exp Med,The Journal of experimental medicine,2985109R,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (Inflammation Mediators)', '0 (Interleukin-15)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'DNA Primers/genetics', 'Genetic Engineering', 'Immunologic Memory', 'Inflammation Mediators/immunology', 'Interleukin-15/*genetics', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*immunology', 'Leukemia, Experimental/etiology/*genetics/*immunology', 'Lymphocytosis/genetics/immunology/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Phenotype', 'Time Factors']",,2001/02/24 11:00,2001/05/18 10:01,['2001/02/24 11:00'],"['2001/02/24 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/05/18 10:01 [medline]', '2001/02/24 11:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Exp Med. 2001 Jan 15;193(2):219-31. doi: 10.1084/jem.193.2.219.,,,['10.1084/jem.193.2.219 [doi]'],PMC2193336,"['P30CA-16058/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-68458/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-65670/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,

RESULTS: Complete remission was obtained in 2 (50%) children, with mean remission time of 13.5 months. One of the children underwent the transplantation of haematopoietic cells from unrelated donor. The main side effect observed was bone marrow aplasia. Leucopenia, granulocytopenia, thrombocytopenia and anaemia persisted for approx. 20 days. Apart from haematological symptoms, the following were also observed: the symptoms of intolerance after ARA-C, aspergillosis of paranasal sinuses and lungs and severe coagulation disorders. CONCLUSION: IDA-FLAG protocol may be recommended for use in children with AML relapse and the undesirable effects observed are acceptable.","['Luczynski, W', 'Muszynska-Roslan, K', 'Krawczuk-Rybak, M', 'Kuzmicz, M', 'Iwaszkiewicz-Pawlowska, A', 'Kaliszewski, J']","['Luczynski W', 'Muszynska-Roslan K', 'Krawczuk-Rybak M', 'Kuzmicz M', 'Iwaszkiewicz-Pawlowska A', 'Kaliszewski J']","['Department of Paediatric Oncology, Medical Academy, Bialystok, Poland. viodek@amb.ac.bialystok.pl']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article']",United States,Med Sci Monit,Medical science monitor : international medical journal of experimental and clinical research,9609063,"['0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'PVI5M0M1GW (Filgrastim)', 'ZRP63D75JW (Idarubicin)', 'Ida-FLAG protocol']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Anemia/chemically induced', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Filgrastim', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Idarubicin/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy', 'Leukopenia/chemically induced', 'Recombinant Proteins', 'Recurrence', 'Thrombocytopenia/chemically induced', 'Time Factors', 'Vidarabine/administration & dosage/adverse effects/analogs & derivatives']",,2001/02/24 11:00,2001/08/03 10:01,['2001/02/24 11:00'],"['2001/02/24 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/08/03 10:01 [medline]', '2001/02/24 11:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Med Sci Monit. 2001 Jan-Feb;7(1):125-9.,,,['1575 [pii]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The role of fibrinolytic system is not clear in the pathomechanism of the disorders. In the study we aimed to evaluate fibrinolysis system in blood plasma of the patients with selected myeloproliferative syndromes on the basis of examinations of plasminogen activators (tissue--t-PA and urokinase-type--u-PA) and type 1 and type 2 plasminogen activator inhibitors (PAI-1 and PAI-2). MATERIAL AND METHODS: Forty-two patients (F/M 28/14) aged 36-78 years (average age--54 years) were enrolled into the study. Among the patients were 20 individuals with chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML), 17 with essential thrombocytemia (ET) and 5 with myelofibrosis (MF) treated in Provincial Haematological Outpatient Clinic in Bydgoszcz. Forty healthy volunteers (F/M 30/10) aged 24-65 (average 53) were included in control group. In citrate venous blood, the following parameters were determined: concentrations of antigen t-PA, u-PA, PAI-1, PAI-2, concentration of plasmin-alpha-2-antiplasmin complexes (PAP) determined with the use of ELISA technique, PAI-1 activity with amidolytic method, euglobulin lysis time (ELT) according to Kowarzyk-Buluk and fibrinogen/fibrin degradation products (FDP) concentration with the use of Merskey's method. RESULTS: Performed evaluations show that besides normal ELT elevated concentrations of FDP and PAP complexes occur in the blood of patients with myeloproliferative syndromes (MPS.). In studied myeloproliferative syndromes, high concentration of PAI-1 Ag and very low activity of PAI-1 were observed. In the patients with MPS intensified plasminogenesis and increased fibrin degradation were demonstrated. The role of granulocyte elastase is considered in activation of fibrinolysis system.","['Rosc, D', 'Kremplewska-Nalezyta, E', 'Gadomska, G', 'Zastawna, E', 'Michalski, A', 'Drewniak, W']","['Rosc D', 'Kremplewska-Nalezyta E', 'Gadomska G', 'Zastawna E', 'Michalski A', 'Drewniak W']","['Department of Pathophysiology, Medical University, ul.

A preliminary study utilizing measurements of thrombin-antithrombin III complexes.,108-11,"UNLABELLED: The mechanisms contributing to thromboembolic complications in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) are complex, but it is believed that two factors are of critical importance, i.e. increased thrombin generation and decreased antithrombotic potential of the blood plasma. We evaluated generation of thrombin in three periods of observation of the children: a) prior to chemotherapy, b) after remission-inducing chemotherapy, and c) after infusion of L-asparaginase in the consolidation phase. The study group consisted of 23 children (x = 6.8 years of age), and a control group of 11 children (x = 7.3 years of age). Thrombin-antithrombin III complex (TAT) was selected as a marker of thrombin generation and it was measured by ELISA method. TAT levels prior to chemotherapy were found to be normal in a small subgroup of children (7/23--ca 30%), i.e. they were within the control range (1.5-4.5 micrograms/l), but all the levels increased following remission-inducing chemotherapy. In contrast, in the major subgroup of children whose TAT levels were elevated at presentation (16/23--ca 70%) no significant changes were observed following chemotherapy. CONCLUSION: There is a subgroup of children with ALL whose thrombin generation is normal as measured by its marker--thrombin-antithrombin III (TAT). Only in those children thrombin generation increases following chemotherapy.","['Uszynski, M', 'Osinska, M', 'Zekanowska, E', 'Ziolkowska, E']","['Uszynski M', 'Osinska M', 'Zekanowska E', 'Ziolkowska E']","['Department of Propedeutics of Medicine, Medical University, Bydgoszcz, Poland.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Med Sci Monit,Medical science monitor : international medical journal of experimental and clinical research,9609063,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (antithrombin III-protease complex)', '9000-94-6 (Antithrombin III)', 'EC 3.4.- (Peptide Hydrolases)', 'EC 3.4.21.5 (Thrombin)', 'EC 3.5.1.1 (Asparaginase)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Agents/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Antithrombin III', 'Asparaginase/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Peptide Hydrolases/*blood', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*blood/classification/complications/drug therapy', 'Remission Induction', 'Thrombin/*metabolism', 'Thromboembolism/etiology']",,2001/02/24 11:00,2001/10/12 10:01,['2001/02/24 11:00'],"['2001/02/24 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/10/12 10:01 [medline]', '2001/02/24 11:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Med Sci Monit. 2000 Jan-Feb;6(1):108-11.,,,['1050 [pii]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

CD95L trimerizes surface CD95 expressed by target cells that subsequently undergo apoptosis. The role of the CD95/CD95L system in the down-regulation of an immune response (activation-induced cell death) is established. However, it is so far unclear why tumors express CD95L. To investigate whether tumors use the CD95L to down-regulate an anti-tumor immune response, we established a transgenic (tg) mouse model consisting of 1) apoptosis-resistant tumor cells, designated LKC-CD95L, which express functional CD95L and the model tumor Ag K(b); and 2) perforin knockout (PKO) anti-K(b) TCR tg mice. L1210-Fas antisense expressing K(b), crmA, and CD95L (LKC-CD95L) killed CD95(+) unrelated tumor targets and Con A-activated splenocytes from anti-K(b) TCR tg PKO mice by a CD95L-dependent mechanism in vitro. However, we could not detect any cytotoxic activity against anti-tumor (anti-K(b)) T cells in vivo. We also observed reduced growth of LKC-CD95L in nude mice and rapid rejection in anti-K(b) TCR tg PKO mice. Because the tumor cells are resistant to CD95L-, TNF-alpha-, and TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand-induced apoptosis and the mice used are perforin-deficient, the involvement of these four cytotoxicity mechanisms in tumor rejection can be excluded. The histological examination of tumors grown in nude mice showed infiltration of LKC-CD95L tumors by neutrophils, whereas L1210-Fas antisense expressing K(b) and crmA (LKC) tumor tissue was neutrophil-free. Chemotaxis experiments revealed that CD95L has no direct neutrophil-attractive activity. Therefore, we conclude that LKC-CD95L cells used an indirect mechanism to attract neutrophils that may cause tumor rejection.","['Behrens, C K', 'Igney, F H', 'Arnold, B', 'Moller, P', 'Krammer, P H']","['Behrens CK', 'Igney FH', 'Arnold B', 'Moller P', 'Krammer PH']","['Tumor Immunology Program, German Cancer Research Center, Heidelberg, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Chemotactic Factors)', '0 (Fas Ligand Protein)', '0 (Fasl protein, mouse)', '0 (H-2 Antigens)', '0 (H-2Kb protein, mouse)', '0 (Ligands)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Oligonucleotides, Antisense)', '0 (Pore Forming Cytotoxic Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)', '0 (Serpins)', '0 (Viral Proteins)', '0 (fas Receptor)', '126465-35-8 (Perforin)', '96282-35-8 (interleukin-1beta-converting enzyme inhibitor)']",IM,"['Animals', 'COS Cells', 'Cell Division/genetics/immunology', 'Chemotactic Factors/physiology', 'Fas Ligand Protein', 'Graft Rejection/genetics/*immunology', 'H-2 Antigens/genetics', 'Leukemia L1210/genetics/*immunology/pathology/prevention & control', 'Ligands', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/*biosynthesis/deficiency/*genetics/physiology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred DBA', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Mice, Nude', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Oligonucleotides, Antisense/genetics/immunology', 'Perforin', 'Pore Forming Cytotoxic Proteins', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/*genetics', 'Serpins/genetics', 'Solubility', 'Transfection', 'Transgenes/*immunology', '*Viral Proteins', 'fas Receptor/genetics/*metabolism']",,2001/02/24 11:00,2001/05/01 10:01,['2001/02/24 11:00'],"['2001/02/24 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/05/01 10:01 [medline]', '2001/02/24 11:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 2001 Mar 1;166(5):3240-7. doi: 10.4049/jimmunol.166.5.3240.,,,['10.4049/jimmunol.166.5.3240 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In two distinct marrow graft rejection systems, host CD8(+) and CD4(+) T cells each separately contributed to host anti-donor T cell-mediated allograft rejection. alpha 4-1BB mAb increased the graft-vs-leukemia effect of a suboptimal number of donor splenocytes given later post bone marrow transplantation by bolstering allogeneic responses resulting in leukemia elimination. In summary, 4-1BB ligation is a potent regulator of CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cell-mediated allogeneic responses in vivo. Modifying the ligation of 4-1BB represents a new approach to altering the graft-vs-host disease and graft-vs-leukemia effects of allogeneic T cells post bone marrow transplantation.","['Blazar, B R', 'Kwon, B S', 'Panoskaltsis-Mortari, A', 'Kwak, K B', 'Peschon, J J', 'Taylor, P A']","['Blazar BR', 'Kwon BS', 'Panoskaltsis-Mortari A', 'Kwak KB', 'Peschon JJ', 'Taylor PA']","['University of Minnesota Cancer Center and Department of Pediatrics, Division of Bone Marrow Transplantation, Minneapolis, MN 55455, USA. blaza001@tc.umn.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (4-1BB Ligand)', '0 (Adjuvants, Immunologic)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (CD28 Antigens)', '0 (Ligands)', '0 (Receptors, Nerve Growth Factor)', '0 (Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor)', '0 (Tnfrsf9 protein, mouse)', '0 (Tnfsf9 protein, mouse)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor Receptor Superfamily, Member 9)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)']",IM,"['4-1BB Ligand', 'Adjuvants, Immunologic/metabolism/physiology', 'Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/administration & dosage', 'Antigens, CD', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/*immunology/mortality', 'CD28 Antigens/physiology', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/cytology/immunology/transplantation', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Cell Division/immunology', 'Graft Rejection/genetics/*immunology', 'Graft vs Host Disease/genetics/*immunology/mortality', 'Graft vs Leukemia Effect/genetics/*immunology', 'Injections, Intraperitoneal', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/immunology/prevention & control', 'Ligands', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Lymphocyte Transfusion', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Receptors, Nerve Growth Factor/deficiency/genetics/*immunology/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor/deficiency/genetics/*immunology/*metabolism', 'T-Lymphocyte Subsets/cytology/immunology', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor Receptor Superfamily, Member 9', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/deficiency/genetics/*physiology']",,2001/02/24 11:00,2001/05/01 10:01,['2001/02/24 11:00'],"['2001/02/24 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/05/01 10:01 [medline]', '2001/02/24 11:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 2001 Mar 1;166(5):3174-83. doi: 10.4049/jimmunol.166.5.3174.,,,['10.4049/jimmunol.166.5.3174 [doi]'],,"['P01 AI-35225/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AI-34495/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA-72669/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 DE-12156/DE/NIDCR NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL63452/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01AI-28175/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R37 HL-56067/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,

The proteasome inhibitor lactacystin differentially regulated the protein levels of proapoptotic Bcl-2 family members and Bik was accumulated at the mitochondria. Bik overexpression sufficed to induce apoptosis in these cells. Detailed examination along the respiration chain showed that lactacystin compromised a step after complex III, and exogenous cytochrome c could overcome this compromise. Probably as a result, the succinate-stimulated generation of mitochondrial membrane potential was significantly diminished. Bcl-x(L) interacted with Bik in the cells, and Bcl-x(L) overexpression prevented cytochrome c leakage out of the mitochondria, corrected the mitochondrial membrane potential defect, and protected the cells from apoptosis. These results show that proteasomes can modulate apoptosis of lymphocytes by affecting the half-life of Bcl-2 family members, Bik being one of them.","['Marshansky, V', 'Wang, X', 'Bertrand, R', 'Luo, H', 'Duguid, W', 'Chinnadurai, G', 'Kanaan, N', 'Vu, M D', 'Wu, J']","['Marshansky V', 'Wang X', 'Bertrand R', 'Luo H', 'Duguid W', 'Chinnadurai G', 'Kanaan N', 'Vu MD', 'Wu J']","[""Research Center, Notre-Dame Hospital, Center hospitalier universitaire de l'Universite de Montreal, University of Montreal, Montreal, Canada. marshanv@receptor.mgh.harvard.edu""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Amino Acid Chloromethyl Ketones)', '0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (BCL2L1 protein, human)', '0 (BIK protein, human)', '0 (Bcl2l1 protein, rat)', '0 (Cysteine Proteinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Cytochrome c Group)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Mitochondrial Proteins)', '0 (Multienzyme Complexes)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (bcl-X Protein)', '0 (benzyloxycarbonylvalyl-alanyl-aspartyl fluoromethyl ketone)', '133343-34-7 (lactacystin)', 'EC 3.4.- (Peptide Hydrolases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Cysteine Endopeptidases)', 'EC 3.4.25.1 (Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex)', 'EC 3.4.99.- (DEVDase)', 'WYQ7N0BPYC (Acetylcysteine)']",IM,"['Acetylcysteine/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Amino Acid Chloromethyl Ketones/pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Apoptosis/drug effects/*immunology', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins', 'Cysteine Endopeptidases/metabolism/*physiology', 'Cysteine Proteinase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Cytochrome c Group/metabolism', 'Electron Transport/drug effects/immunology', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects/immunology', 'Humans', 'Intracellular Membranes/enzymology/immunology', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Leukemia, B-Cell/*enzymology/immunology/metabolism/*pathology', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/*enzymology/immunology/metabolism/*pathology', 'Membrane Potentials/immunology', '*Membrane Proteins', 'Mitochondria/enzymology/immunology', 'Mitochondrial Proteins', 'Multienzyme Complexes/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism/*physiology', 'Peptide Hydrolases/metabolism', 'Permeability', 'Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex', 'Protein Biosynthesis', 'Proteins/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/biosynthesis/*metabolism/physiology', 'Rats', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'bcl-X Protein']",,2001/02/24 11:00,2001/05/01 10:01,['2001/02/24 11:00'],"['2001/02/24 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/05/01 10:01 [medline]', '2001/02/24 11:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 2001 Mar 1;166(5):3130-42. doi: 10.4049/jimmunol.166.5.3130.,,,['10.4049/jimmunol.166.5.3130 [doi]'],,['R01 CA033616/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,

This screening yielded a 552-bp cDNA coding for catfish thioredoxin (CF-TRX). The deduced amino acid sequence revealed that CF-TRX contains 107 amino acids and is 59% homologous to human adult T cell leukemia-derived factor/TRX, originally described as an IL-2R alpha-inducing factor. Northern blot analyses showed that CF-TRX is expressed in catfish T and macrophage cell lines, but weakly in B cell lines. Similar results were also observed in Western blot analyses using a mAb specific for recombinant CF-TRX (rTRX). The use of rTRX in functional studies demonstrated that rTRX induces in vitro proliferative responses of catfish PBL that were synergistically enhanced by the addition of culture supernatants from catfish T cell lines. In addition, cell separation studies and flow cytometric analyses revealed that the cells proliferating in rTRX-stimulated cultures were mostly B cells. These results suggest that CF-TRX may have an important role in the activation and proliferation of channel catfish B cells.","['Khayat, M', 'Stuge, T B', 'Wilson, M', 'Bengten, E', 'Miller, N W', 'Clem, L W']","['Khayat M', 'Stuge TB', 'Wilson M', 'Bengten E', 'Miller NW', 'Clem LW']","['Department of Microbiology, University of Mississippi Medical Center, Jackson, MS 39216, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Growth Substances)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '52500-60-4 (Thioredoxins)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'B-Lymphocytes/*cytology/drug effects/metabolism', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects/immunology', 'Cell Line', 'Growth Substances/biosynthesis/genetics/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Ictaluridae/*immunology', 'Macrophages/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Recombinant Proteins/pharmacology', 'Thioredoxins/chemistry/genetics/isolation & purification/*pharmacology']",,2001/02/24 11:00,2001/05/01 10:01,['2001/02/24 11:00'],"['2001/02/24 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/05/01 10:01 [medline]', '2001/02/24 11:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 2001 Mar 1;166(5):2937-43. doi: 10.4049/jimmunol.166.5.2937.,,,['10.4049/jimmunol.166.5.2937 [doi]'],,['AI-19530/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States'],,,,['GENBANK/AF293651'],,,,,,,,

The records were linked to the Canadian Cancer Data Base, with incidence data from 1969 to 1988. Standardized incidence ratios were calculated using Canadian cancer incidence rates stratified by age, sex, and calendar year. Excess relative risks were obtained from internally based dose-response analyses. The following significant results were found for males and females combined: a deficit in the standardized incidence ratio for all cancers combined; elevated standardized incidence ratios for thyroid cancer and melanoma; and elevated excess relative risks for rectum, leukemia, lung, all cancers combined, all except lung, and all except leukemia. For males, cancers of the colon, pancreas, and testis also showed significantly elevated excess relative risks. The specific cancer types listed above have been implicated in previous studies on occupational exposure to ionizing radiation, except for testis, colon, and melanoma, while the findings on thyroid cancer from previous studies are inconclusive. The thyroid standardized incidence ratios in this study are highly significant, but further investigation is needed to assess the possibility of association with occupational radiation exposure.","['Sont, W N', 'Zielinski, J M', 'Ashmore, J P', 'Jiang, H', 'Krewski, D', 'Fair, M E', 'Band, P R', 'Letourneau, E G']","['Sont WN', 'Zielinski JM', 'Ashmore JP', 'Jiang H', 'Krewski D', 'Fair ME', 'Band PR', 'Letourneau EG']","['Radiation Protection Bureau, Health Canada, Ottawa, Ontario. willem_n_sont@hc-sc.gc.ca']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",United States,Am J Epidemiol,American journal of epidemiology,7910653,,IM,"['Canada/epidemiology', 'Cohort Studies', 'Female', 'Health Personnel', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Male', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced/*epidemiology', 'Occupational Exposure/*adverse effects', 'Radiation, Ionizing', 'Radiometry', 'Registries', 'Risk Factors', 'Sex Distribution', 'Thyroid Neoplasms/epidemiology']",,2001/02/24 11:00,2001/07/20 10:01,['2001/02/24 11:00'],"['2001/02/24 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/07/20 10:01 [medline]', '2001/02/24 11:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Am J Epidemiol. 2001 Feb 15;153(4):309-18. doi: 10.1093/aje/153.4.309.,,,['10.1093/aje/153.4.309 [doi]'],,,,['Am J Epidemiol. 2001 Feb 15;153(4):319-22; discussion 323-4.

The development of leukaemia in SCID-CEM mice treated with three 10 microg i.v. doses of the anti-CD7 immunotoxin (IT) HB2-SAPORIN or the anti-CD38 IT OKT10-SAPORIN was significantly delayed compared with PBS sham-treated animals but 90% of animals treated with either IT eventually developed disseminated leukaemia cell growth. In contrast treatment of SCID-CEM mice with a combination of both ITs led not only to a significantly greater delay in time to leukaemia development but also in the numbers of animals remaining leukaemia free (60%). The native HB2 and OKT10 antibodies (both murine IgG1antibodies) exerted significant, though relatively weak therapeutic effects, probably mediated through an antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) mechanism. Moreover, there was no in vivo additivity of therapeutic effect when both antibodies were used in combination. Apparent, however, was that the combination of HB2-SAPORIN IT with OKT10 antibody led to an intermediate therapeutic effect that was significantly greater than that obtained when either was used alone but significantly less than that obtained when the two IT combination was utilized. This was similarly the case for the combination of OKT10-SAPORIN IT with HB2 antibody though the effect was less pronounced in this instance. This result suggests that the therapeutic effect of IT + antibody treatment results from an additivity between antibody-mediated delivery of saporin combined with a SCID mouse NK cell-mediated ADCC attack on the target cell directed through target cell bound antibody Fc engagement with FcgammaRIII on the NK cell surface. The combination of both ITs however gave the best therapeutic outcome in SCID-CEM mice probably as the result of (i) delivery of greater amounts of saporin to target CEM cells positive for both CD7 and CD38, (ii) delivery of an effective dose of saporin to CEM cells downregulated or negative for one of the target antigens and (iii) through ADCC mechanisms that interact additively with IT action. We have previously proposed that combination IT therapy would be one means of overcoming the problem of heterogeneity of antigen expression within a global tumour cell population and these additional findings support this and provide a further strengthening of the rationale for employing cocktails of ITs for the treatment of human malignancies.","['Flavell, D J', 'Boehm, D A', 'Noss, A', 'Warnes, S L', 'Flavell, S U']","['Flavell DJ', 'Boehm DA', 'Noss A', 'Warnes SL', 'Flavell SU']","['The Simon Flavell Leukaemia Research Unit, Division of Cancer Sciences, University of Southampton Medical School, Southampton General Hospital, Tremona Rd., Southampton, Hampshire, SO16 6YD, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Cancer,British journal of cancer,0370635,"['0 (Antibodies, Neoplasm)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, CD7)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Immunoglobulin G)', '0 (Immunotoxins)', '0 (Lipoproteins, HDL)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Plant Proteins)', '0 (RNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Lipoprotein)', '0 (Ribosome Inactivating Proteins, Type 1)', '0 (high density lipoprotein receptors)', '147605-06-9 (high density lipoprotein binding protein)', 'EC 3.2.2.- (N-Glycosyl Hydrolases)', 'EC 3.2.2.22 (Saporins)', 'EC 3.2.2.5 (ADP-ribosyl Cyclase)', 'EC 3.2.2.5 (Cd38 protein, mouse)', 'EC 3.2.2.5 (NAD+ Nucleosidase)', 'EC 3.2.2.6 (ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1)']",IM,"['ADP-ribosyl Cyclase', 'ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1', 'Animals', 'Antibodies, Neoplasm/immunology/*pharmacology', 'Antibody Formation', '*Antigens, CD', 'Antigens, CD7/*immunology', 'Antigens, Differentiation/*immunology', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/immunology/*pharmacology', '*Carrier Proteins', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Drug Therapy, Combination', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Immunoglobulin G/immunology', 'Immunotoxins/immunology/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/drug therapy/*immunology', '*Lipoproteins, HDL', 'Male', 'Membrane Glycoproteins', 'Mice', 'Mice, SCID', '*N-Glycosyl Hydrolases', 'NAD+ Nucleosidase/*immunology', 'Plant Proteins/immunology/*pharmacology', '*RNA-Binding Proteins', 'Receptors, Lipoprotein', 'Ribosome Inactivating Proteins, Type 1', 'Saporins']",,2001/02/24 11:00,2001/04/06 10:01,['2001/02/24 11:00'],"['2001/02/24 11:00 [pubmed]', '2001/04/06 10:01 [medline]', '2001/02/24 11:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Br J Cancer. 2001 Feb;84(4):571-8. doi: 10.1054/bjoc.2000.1633.,,['Copyright 2001 Cancer Research Campaign.'],"['10.1054/bjoc.2000.1633 [doi]', 'S0007092000916331 [pii]']",PMC2363766,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The general acceptance of laparoscopic splenectomy (LS) may be hindered by its infrequent performance and difficulty in manipulating the spleen. A retrospective review of splenectomies performed for primary splenic pathology was done to assess the role and outcome of LS. One hundred fifty LSs were performed from July 1995 through September 1999. Over that time period the proportion of LS performed increased steadily from 17 to 75 per cent of all splenectomies. The primary indications for splenectomy included immune thrombocytopenic purpura in 75 (50%), lymphoma/leukemia 36 (24%), and splenomegaly 19 (13%). There were 86 females and 64 males. Immediately before operation 36 patients (4%) had a platelet count <50,000/ mL, and 24 patients (16%) a hemoglobin <10 mg per cent. The mean operative time was 161 minutes with an average blood loss of 138 cm3 (<50-800). The mean morcellated weight of the entire group was 411 g (33-3300) indicating generally large splenic size. In the 37 patients with splenomegaly the mean weight was 735 g (293-3300). There were two conversions to open splenectomy. Two patients with hematologic malignancy, splenomegaly, and cytopenias died from overwhelming post-splenectomy sepsis (1.3%). Morbidity occurred in 14 (9%) with the most common complication being pancreatitis in seven (5%). The median length of postoperative stay was 2.4 days (range 1-5). In summary LS has rapidly replaced the open approach for nearly all elective splenectomies in adults and children. When performed with the patient in the lateral position it can be accomplished with minimal morbidity, even in complex patients, including those with splenomegaly.","['Walsh, R M', 'Heniford, B T', 'Brody, F', 'Ponsky, J']","['Walsh RM', 'Heniford BT', 'Brody F', 'Ponsky J']","['Department of General Surgery, Cleveland Clinic Foundation, Ohio 44195, USA.']",['eng'],"['Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,Am Surg,The American surgeon,0370522,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Laparoscopy/adverse effects/*methods', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Splenectomy/adverse effects/*methods']",,2001/02/24 12:00,2001/03/03 10:01,['2001/02/24 12:00'],"['2001/02/24 12:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/03 10:01 [medline]', '2001/02/24 12:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Am Surg. 2001 Jan;67(1):48-53.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The subtle visible differences exhibited by some malignant lymphomas and leukemia, however, give rise to a significant number of false negatives during microscopic evaluation by medical technologists. We have developed a distributed, clinical decision support prototype for distinguishing among hematologic malignancies. The system consists of two major components, a distributed telemicroscopy system and an intelligent image repository. The hybrid system enables individuals located at disparate clinical and research sites to engage in interactive consultation and to obtain computer-assisted decision support. Software, written in JAVA, allows primary users to control the specimen stage, objective lens, light levels, and focus of a robotic microscope remotely while a digital representation of the specimen is continuously broadcast to all session participants. Primary user status can be passed as a token. The system features shared graphical pointers, text messaging capability, and automated database management. Search engines for the database allow one to automatically identify and retrieve images, diagnoses, and correlated clinical data of cases from a ""gold standard"" database which exhibit spectral and spatial profiles which are most similar to a given query image.

In an open phase-II study we treated 23 patients with a median age of 62 years at study entry (43-86 years) with advanced, refractory or relapsed (Rai stage III n = 9, Rai stage IV n = 14) chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) with bendamustine. At study entry, only 13 patients were chemotherapy-naive. The treatment schedule with bendamustine was as follows: for patients up to 70 years 60 mg/m2 for 5 days, for patients over 70 years 50 mg/m2 for 5 days, repetition at day 29. Remission criteria were used according to Cheson et al. (1996). All patients were evaluable for toxicity and 20 for response. An objective remission was achieved in 15/20 patients (75%), including six patients with complete remission (CR). Three of the complete responders had no chemotherapy prior to bendamustine. No change (NC) occurred in 5/20 patients (25%). Median overall survival after bendamustine treatment is 13.6 months (1-46 months) and 16.6 months (1-46 months) in patients responding to bendamustine. In total, 74 courses of bendamustine were applied. Therapy-related anemia and thrombocytopenia were rare. However, WHO grade III/IV leukocytopenia occurred in 38/74 cycles (51%), resulting in treatment-related mortality in 3/23 patients (13%). These patients were severely immunocompromised due to pretreatment or the underlying disease. As a corollary of the study, a general prophylactic antibiotic treatment (trimethoprim/ sulfamerazine) was instituted. A general feature was the decline of the CD4/CD8 ratio: mean before therapy: 1.36; after two courses: 0.98; after four courses: 0.6, as documented in all patients who received at least two courses of bendamustine (n = 12). All evaluable patients showed a decline in the CD4/8 ratio. However, this decline was not clearly related to an increased risk of infectious episodes. We observed mainly cutaneous allergic reactions (three WHO grade I; one WHO grade II) leading to a cessation of bendamustine treatment in 4/23 patients (18%). Bendamustine is highly effective in advanced or refractory CLL. In multiple pretreated or otherwise severely immunocompromised patients bendamustine might lead to additional immunosuppression with subsequent infectious complications.","['Kath, R', 'Blumenstengel, K', 'Fricke, H J', 'Hoffken, K']","['Kath R', 'Blumenstengel K', 'Fricke HJ', 'Hoffken K']","['Klinik und Poliklinik fur Innere Medizin II der Friedrich Schiller Universitat Jena, Germany.

Et743 selectively alkylates guanine N2 from the minor groove of duplex DNA and bends the DNA toward the major groove. This differentiates Et743 from other DNA-alkylating agents presently in the clinic. To date, the cellular effects of Et743 have not been elucidated. Recently, Et743 DNA adducts have been found to suppress gene expression selectively and to induce topoisomerase I (top1) cleavage complexes in vitro and top1-DNA complexes in cell culture. In the present study, we characterized the DNA damage and the cell cycle response induced by Et743 in human colon carcinoma HCT116 cells. Alkaline elution experiments demonstrated that micromolar concentrations of Et743 produced comparable frequencies of DNA-protein cross-links and DNA single-strand breaks. The single-strand breaks were protein-cross-linked and were not associated with detectable DNA double-strand breaks. By contrast with camptothecin, these lesions persisted for several hours after drug removal and were not formed at 4 degrees C. Et743 treatment induced transient p53 elevation, dose-dependent cell cycle accumulation in G2-M and in G1- and S-phase, and inhibition of DNA synthesis. The sensitivity of camptothecin-resistant mouse leukemia P388/ CPT45 cells, which fail to express detectable top1, was similar to the sensitivity of wild-type P388 cells, suggesting that top1 is not a critical target for the antiproliferative activity of Et743.","['Takebayashi, Y', 'Goldwasser, F', 'Urasaki, Y', 'Kohlhagen, G', 'Pommier, Y']","['Takebayashi Y', 'Goldwasser F', 'Urasaki Y', 'Kohlhagen G', 'Pommier Y']","['Laboratory of Molecular Pharmacology, Division of Basic Sciences, National Cancer Institute, NIH, Bethesda, Maryland 20892-4255, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Dioxoles)', '0 (Formazans)', '0 (Isoquinolines)', '0 (Proliferating Cell Nuclear Antigen)', '0 (Tetrahydroisoquinolines)', '0 (Tetrazolium Salts)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '23305-68-2 (MTT formazan)', 'EC 5.99.1.2 (DNA Topoisomerases, Type I)', 'ID0YZQ2TCP (Trabectedin)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating/*pharmacology', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Division/*drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Colonic Neoplasms/enzymology/*genetics', 'DNA Damage/*drug effects', 'DNA Topoisomerases, Type I/*metabolism', 'DNA, Neoplasm/*drug effects', 'Dioxoles/*pharmacology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Formazans', 'Humans', 'Immunoenzyme Techniques', 'Isoquinolines/*pharmacology', 'Proliferating Cell Nuclear Antigen/metabolism', 'Tetrahydroisoquinolines', 'Tetrazolium Salts', 'Trabectedin', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/metabolism']",,2001/02/24 12:00,2001/03/27 10:01,['2001/02/24 12:00'],"['2001/02/24 12:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/27 10:01 [medline]', '2001/02/24 12:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2001 Jan;7(1):185-91.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We showed previously that this enzyme holds a critical role in regulating tumor cell fate, including cell death, as its expression is down-regulated in response to retinoic acid, a potent anticancer therapeutic. Indeed, direct inhibition of HMG-CoA reductase with lovastatin, a competitive inhibitor of this enzyme, induced a pronounced apoptotic response in neuroblastoma and acute myeloid leukemic cells. We have now extended this work and evaluated a wide variety and large number of tumor-derived cell lines for their sensitivity to lovastatin-induced apoptosis. These cell lines were exposed to a wide range (0-100 microM) of lovastatin for 2 days and assayed for cell viability using the 3,4,5-dimethyl thiazlyl-2,2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay and the induction of apoptosis by flow cytometric and ultrastructural analyses. Lovastatin induced a pronounced apoptotic response in cells derived from juvenile monomyelocytic leukemia, pediatric solid malignancies (rhabdomyosarcoma and medulloblastoma), and squamous cell carcinoma of the cervix and of the head and neck. Interestingly, the subset of malignancies that are particularly sensitive to lovastatin-induced apoptosis correspond to those tumor subtypes that are sensitive to the biological and antiproliferative effects of retinoids in vitro. The nature of the biologically active form of lovastatin has been challenged recently as the growth-inhibitory effects of this drug were attributed to its prodrug lactone form that does not inhibit HMG-CoA reductase function. In this report, we demonstrate that the apoptotic properties of lovastatin are triggered by the open ring acid form that is a potent inhibitor of HMG-CoA reductase activity. Thus, we have identified a subset of tumors that are sensitive to lovastatin-induced apoptosis and show HMG-CoA reductase as a potential therapeutic target of these cancers.","['Dimitroulakos, J', 'Ye, L Y', 'Benzaquen, M', 'Moore, M J', 'Kamel-Reid, S', 'Freedman, M H', 'Yeger, H', 'Penn, L Z']","['Dimitroulakos J', 'Ye LY', 'Benzaquen M', 'Moore MJ', 'Kamel-Reid S', 'Freedman MH', 'Yeger H', 'Penn LZ']","['Division of Cellular and Molecular Biology Ontario Cancer Institute, University Health Network, Toronto, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Formazans)', '0 (Hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA Reductase Inhibitors)', '0 (Tetrazolium Salts)', '23305-68-2 (MTT formazan)', '9LHU78OQFD (Lovastatin)', 'EC 1.1.1.- (Hydroxymethylglutaryl CoA Reductases)', 'S5UOB36OCZ (Mevalonic Acid)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Child', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Formazans', 'Humans', 'Hydroxymethylglutaryl CoA Reductases/metabolism', 'Hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA Reductase Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Lovastatin/*pharmacology', 'Mass Spectrometry', 'Mevalonic Acid/pharmacology', 'Microscopy, Electron', 'Neoplasms/*drug therapy', 'Tetrazolium Salts', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/cytology/drug effects']",,2001/02/24 12:00,2001/03/27 10:01,['2001/02/24 12:00'],"['2001/02/24 12:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/27 10:01 [medline]', '2001/02/24 12:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2001 Jan;7(1):158-67.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Drug resistance is a major cause of poor outcome. One of the most investigated resistance mechanisms is the P-glycoprotein (P-gp)-mediated multiple-drug resistance (MDR). The authors prospectively analyzed P-gp using flow cytometry with monoclonal antibody JSB1 in a population-based series of 103 children with ALL treated according to intensive Nordic ALL protocols. Increased P-gp expression was detected in 55 patients (53%). With a cutoff value of 1% P-gp-positive blasts in bone marrow, no difference was found in event-free survival (EFS) or overall survival between children with low vs. increased P-gp expression. The 4-year EFS in the whole series was 77%. Patients with T-ALL had higher P-gp levels than the others, 3.6% vs. 1.0% (p = .002). P-gp expression did not correlate with the white blood cell count, age, sex, or cytogenetics.

Important differences from adult stroke include the following: (1) frequently delayed or missed diagnosis, (2) heterogenous and overlapping risk factors, and (3) developmental differences in the cerebrovascular, neurologic, and coagulation systems. These aspects limit the extrapolation of the results of adult stroke research and present challenges in caring for children with stroke. The incidence of childhood ischemic stroke exceeds 3.3 in 100,000 children per year, more than double the estimates from past decades. The increased incidence reflects, in part, increased survival in previously fatal conditions predisposing to stroke, including congenital heart disease, sickle cell anemia, and leukemia. Risk factors for stroke are recognized in more than 75% of children. Common risk factors include congenital heart disease and sickle cell disease. Progressive arteriopathies, including vasculitis and moyamoya syndrome, are rare in children with stroke; however, transient arteriopathies including post-varicella angiopathy are increasingly recognized. Prothrombotic abnormalities are frequently present but of unclear significance. Adverse outcomes after childhood stroke, including death in 10%, recurrence in 20%, and neurologic deficits in two thirds of survivors could be reduced with available stroke treatments. Aggressive prehospital emergency care and transfer could improve access to hyperacute stroke therapies including tPA. Currently, the diagnosis is delayed by more than 24 hours from onset in most children. As in adults, tPA will likely produce unacceptable rates of intracerebral hemmorrhage unless given within 3 hours of stroke symptom onset. The appropriate choices for in hospital treatment and secondary preventative strategies, including aspirin and anticoagulants, are controversial. Empiric recommendations are published; however, age-appropriate clinical trials are urgently needed.

We analyzed the expression of MUC1 and EGP40 in human bone marrow (BM) and peripheral blood (PB) by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and immunocytochemistry (ICC). Eight BM and 95 PB samples from healthy donors, 39 BM and 17 PB samples from patients with haematological malignancies and 45 BM samples from patients with breast cancer were analyzed. MUC1 mRNA and EGP40 mRNA and protein were detected in BM samples and PB samples from healthy donors and from patients with multiple myeloma (MM), non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) and chronic myelogenous leukaemia (CML).

The MUC1 and EGP40 nested PCR were positive in 83.3% (10/12) and in 100% (33/33) respectively of BM from patiens with breast cancer who had no evidence of distant metastases. It is concluded that MUC1 and EGP40 is expressed in haematopoietic tissues and haematological malignancies.

This is accompanied by the introduction of mutations into the immunoglobulin (Ig) variable region (V) genes. The B cells are then selected according to the affinity of the encoded immunoglobulin for antigen, resulting in affinity maturation of the response. Analysis of mutations in IgV genes has given insight into the history of individual B cells and their malignancies. In most cases, analysis of mutations confirms classifications of B-cell lineage designated by studies of cellular morphology and surface antigen expression. However, of particular interest is the subdivision of groups of malignancies by analysis of somatic hypermutation. It is now apparent that there are two subsets of chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL), one with a low load of mutations and poor prognosis. and one with a heavy load of mutations with a much more favourable prognosis. In addition, in Burkitt's lymphoma, sporadic and endemic subtypes are now considered possibly to have a different pathogenesis, reflected in differences in the numbers of mutations. Hodgkin's disease, which was a mystery for many years, has now been shown to be a B-cell tumour. Although in many cases the Ig genes are crippled by somatic hypermutation, it is thought that failure to express Ig is more likely to be associated with problems of transcription. It has been proposed that the distribution of mutations in a B-cell lymphoma can be used to determine whether a lymphoma is selected. We have investigated the load and distribution of mutations in one group of lymphomas--marginal zone B-cell lymphomas of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissues (MALT-type lymphoma), which are dependent on Helicobacter pylori for disease progression, to investigate the limits of information that can be derived from such studies. Comparison of the load of mutations demonstrates that these tumours have approximately the same load of mutations as normal mucosal marginal zone B cells from the Peyer's patches and mucosal plasma cells. This is consistent with the origin of these cells from mucosal marginal zone B cells with plasma cell differentiation. To investigate selection in MALT lymphomas we compared a region of the framework region three in ten MALT lymphomas which use the V(H4) family, with the same codons in groups of V(H4) genes that are out of frame between V and J. The latter accumulate mutations but are not used and are not selected. A group of V(H4) genes are in-frame between V and J were also included for comparison. There were no obvious differences in the distribution of mutations between the groups of genes; the same hot spots and cold spots were apparent in each. In the MALT lymphomas, selection was apparent in the framework regions only and the tendency was to conserve. We therefore feel that there is selection to conserve antibody structure and that this does not reflect selection for antigen. We do not believe that antigen selection can be deduced reliably from sequence information alone. It is possible that somatic hypermutation could be a cause of malignancy since it has been shown that the process may generate DNA strand breaks and is known to be able to generate insertions and deletions. Such events may mediate the translocation of genes--a process that is pivotal in the evolution of many lymphomas.","['Dunn-Walters, D', 'Thiede, C', 'Alpen, B', 'Spencer, J']","['Dunn-Walters D', 'Thiede C', 'Alpen B', 'Spencer J']","[""Department of Histopathology, Guy's, King's and St Thomas' Medical School, London, UK.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Philos Trans R Soc Lond B Biol Sci,"Philosophical transactions of the Royal Society of London.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Apoptosis was demonstrated in drug-sensitive HL-60 and multidrug-resistant human promyelocytic leukemia HL-60/ADR (MRP) and HL-60/VCR (MDR-1) cells in vitro with the aid of flow cytometry, DNA analysis and western blotting. RESULTS: The techniques used herein determined accumulation of paclitaxel/PSC 833 induced apoptotic cells with sub-G0 (hypodiploid) DNA content and blocked in the G2/M phase of the cell cycle, internucleosomal DNA fragmentation, poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase cleavage, Bcl-2 modulation and Bax up-regulation, without any significant alterations in the levels of Bcl-xL, CD95/Fas or Fas-L proteins. CONCLUSION: Drug resistance modulator PSC 833 abolished the P-gp-mediated multidrug-resistance to paclitaxel and paclitaxel-induced apoptosis in human myeloid leukemia (HL-60/VCR) cells in vitro. Furthermore, PSC 833 alone induced apoptosis in parental drug-sensitive leukemia cells, but not in both multidrug-resistant sublines studied.","['Duraj, J', 'Takacsova, X', 'Sedlak, J', 'Sulikova, M', 'Hunakova, L', 'Bies, J', 'Chorvath, B']","['Duraj J', 'Takacsova X', 'Sedlak J', 'Sulikova M', 'Hunakova L', 'Bies J', 'Chorvath B']","['Cancer Research Institute, Slovak Academy of Sciences, Vlarska 7, 83391 Bratislava, Slovakia. exondura@savba.sk']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Greece,Anticancer Res,Anticancer research,8102988,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (BAX protein, human)', '0 (BCL2L1 protein, human)', '0 (Cyclosporins)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', '0 (bcl-X Protein)', '0 (fas Receptor)', 'EC 2.4.2.30 (Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases)', 'P88XT4IS4D (Paclitaxel)', 'Q7ZP55KF3X (valspodar)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cyclosporins/*pharmacology', 'DNA Fragmentation', 'DNA, Neoplasm/drug effects', '*Drug Resistance, Multiple', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'HL-60 Cells/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Paclitaxel/*pharmacology', 'Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'Up-Regulation', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein', 'bcl-X Protein', 'fas Receptor/metabolism']",,2001/02/24 12:00,2001/03/07 10:01,['2001/02/24 12:00'],"['2001/02/24 12:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/07 10:01 [medline]', '2001/02/24 12:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Anticancer Res. 2000 Nov-Dec;20(6B):4627-32.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

II: Evaluation of the role of metallothionein expression on the chemotherapy-induced apoptosis during the treatment of acute leukemia.,4407-11,"Metallothioneins (MT) are low molecular weight cysteine-rich proteins, present in a wide variety of eukaryotes. Although their physiological function is not entirely understood, recently it was found that in vitro human MTs (hMTs) expression prevents apoptosis. In the present study, the apoptosis preventing effect of hMTs is evaluated in vivo, in order to correlate the apoptotic effect of chemotherapy during the treatment of acute leukemia with the expression of hMTs. The expression of hMTs was studied immunocytochemically in bone marrow smears and peripheral blood cytocentrifugations of 47 children with acute leukemia at diagnosis and during treatment. Apoptosis was quantitatively studied in peripheral blood samples during the induction therapy. Eighteen cases were found to be positive for hMTs expression at diagnosis and the mean apoptosis curve of these cases showed maximal effect on the second day of treatment, the apoptotic action of chemotherapy being completed on the tenth day. The mean apoptosis curve of the hMTs negative cases (29 cases) showed maximal effect on the first day of treatment and the apoptotic action of chemotherapy was completed on the sixth day. When considering the day on which the maximal apoptotic effect appeared and the day on which the apoptotic action of treatment was completed, the results indicated retardation of the chemotherapy-induced apoptosis dependent on hMTs expression, as a result of resistance to treatment. Furthermore, the study of hMTs expression during treatment, showed that although the apoptotic action of chemotherapy eliminates blast cells, a cell population positive for hMTs survived and increased during treatment, since they were able to escape apoptotic cell death. These findings, indicated that in vivo, hMTs constitute a cellular protective mechanism preventing chemotherapy-induced apoptosis, thus regulating the response of patients to treatment.","['Tsangaris, G T', 'Vamvoukakis, J', 'Politis, I', 'Kattamis, A C', 'Tzortzatou-Stathopoulou, F']","['Tsangaris GT', 'Vamvoukakis J', 'Politis I', 'Kattamis AC', 'Tzortzatou-Stathopoulou F']","[""University Research Institute for the Study and Treatment of Childhood Genetic and Malignant Diseases, University of Athens, Aghia Sophia Children's Hospital, 115 27 Athens, Greece.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Greece,Anticancer Res,Anticancer research,8102988,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '9038-94-2 (Metallothionein)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis/*physiology', 'Bone Marrow/*metabolism', 'Child', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/drug therapy/*metabolism/physiopathology', 'Metallothionein/*metabolism', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*metabolism', 'Time Factors']",,2001/02/24 12:00,2001/03/07 10:01,['2001/02/24 12:00'],"['2001/02/24 12:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/07 10:01 [medline]', '2001/02/24 12:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Anticancer Res. 2000 Nov-Dec;20(6B):4407-11.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Autopsy of the rats, revealed metastasis in the lungs of the animals of all groups and the tumors developed were histologically identified as leiomyosarcomas.

To address this question, two leukemia cell lines, ML-1 (with wild type p53) and HL-60 (p53 null) were treated with camptothecin to induce similar degree of apoptosis and residual survival. Western blot analysis indicated rapid induction of p53 in ML-1 followed by significant decrease of TOP2 alpha mRNA and protein levels.

Ac-DEVD-CHO caused a marked decrease in the fraction of cells in the early phase of apoptosis. However, there was a corresponding increase in the fraction of cells in the late apoptotic/necrotic stages of cell death. This is in marked contrast to the dGuo-induced decrease in apoptosis seen in the MTX- and TZ-treated Y8 cells in which there were no increases in the late apoptotic/necrotic fraction of cells. These data show that alterations of nucleotide pools in the Y8 cells cause marked increases in the apoptotic response which may indicate that the Y8 cells are much more susceptible to the effects of misincorporation of nucleotides into DNA than are the parental WT L1210 cells.","['Cory, A H', 'Hickerson, D H', 'Cory, J G']","['Cory AH', 'Hickerson DH', 'Cory JG']","['Department of Biochemistry, Brody School of Medicine, East Carolina University, Greenville, NC 27858, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Greece,Anticancer Res,Anticancer research,8102988,"['0 (Deoxyadenosines)', '0 (Nucleotides)', '30KYC7MIAI (Aspartic Acid)', '49717AWG6K (Ribavirin)', '78QVZ7RG8L (sparfosic acid)', 'EC 1.17.4.- (Ribonucleotide Reductases)', 'G9481N71RO (Deoxyguanosine)', 'HU9DX48N0T (Mycophenolic Acid)', 'N919E46723 (Phosphonoacetic Acid)', 'ULJ82834RE (tiazofurin)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/genetics/*physiology', 'Aspartic Acid/*analogs & derivatives/antagonists & inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Deoxyadenosines/*pharmacology', 'Deoxyguanosine/antagonists & inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance', 'Genes, p53', 'Leukemia L1210/metabolism/*pathology/physiopathology', 'Methotrexate/antagonists & inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Mycophenolic Acid/antagonists & inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Nucleotides/*biosynthesis', 'Phosphonoacetic Acid/*analogs & derivatives/antagonists & inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Ribavirin/*analogs & derivatives/antagonists & inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Ribonucleotide Reductases/*antagonists & inhibitors']",,2001/02/24 12:00,2001/03/07 10:01,['2001/02/24 12:00'],"['2001/02/24 12:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/07 10:01 [medline]', '2001/02/24 12:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Anticancer Res. 2000 Nov-Dec;20(6B):4171-8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Diagnosis of AML was established by bone marrow and lymph node histological analysis. Computed tomography (CT) scan and 99mTc-MDP bone scintyscan revealed osteolytic lesions. After remission-induction, bone marrow aspirate and biopsy showed no evidence of leukemic infiltration, nevertheless bone abnormalities persisted on 99mTc-MDP bone scintyscan, suggesting residual disease. Suspect bone areas were irradiated with symptomatic improvement and 99mTc-MDP bone scintyscan showed the appearance of more condensed bone compared with the pre-radiotherapy pattern. Twelve months later he was readmitted to the hospital due to relapse of AML and died of sepsis within a few weeks. This report illustrates the usefulness of histological studies to establish diagnosis of AML in atypical cases, as well as the importance of CT scan and bone scintigraphy scan for the identification of osteolytic lesions.

In all but one of the patients the ulcers were situated in the ankle region. At the time of onset of ulceration, none of them had extreme values in their peripheral blood counts. All had one or more of the predisposing factors such as minor trauma or mild varicosity. None of the patients had any alteration in arterial or venous circulation when examined by non-invasive means. No hyperviscosity was found as measured by capillary viscosimeter. The ulcers were cured in three patients without discontinuation of the drug. One patient later developed an ulcer on the other leg. The ulcers healed in two patients only after having stopped the hydroxyurea medication. One patient still had the ulcer when she succumbed to the underlying CML in transformation. In conclusion, cutaneous, ulceration of the leg is relatively common during hydroxyurea therapy. Predisposing factors are also involved in its development.

(1) LAK cells were grown in the presence of IL-2, in some cases additionally with IL-6. (2) These cytotoxic cells were cocultured with (untreated or cytokine pretreated) AML-BM cells obtained at different stages of the disease. Therefore BM cells were (a) either frozen in liquid nitrogen or (b) precultured for 14 days with cytokines: IL-1beta, IL-3, IL-6, erythropoietin (EPO), stem cell factor (SCF) with ('Cytok1') or without granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) ('Cytok2') or with no added cytokines ('ISC/FCS') as a control. (3) Southern blot analysis was used to detect clonal BM cells. At diagnosis, 76 of 151 cases (50%) studied showed clonal gene rearrangements in marker genes. (4) Southern blot analysis and flow cytometry were used to compare the amount of clonal and CD34 positive BM cells before and after coculture procedures. Coculture experiments with untreated BM and autologous LAK cells led to a reduction of clonal cells in 2 of 5 cases at diagnosis, in 11 of 17 BM samples in complete remission but not in the one case studied at relapse. Similar results were found if precultured AML cells (with or without cytokines) were cocultivated with LAK cells. However the cytotoxic effect of LAK cells was more pronounced if cytokines (especially GM-CSF and SCF) were comprised. Our data indicate, that (1) clonality in AML can be demonstrated by Southern blot analysis; (2) CD34 positive cells in AML are clonal, gene rearranged cells; (3) clonal cell populations persist in BM during complete remission and relapse in most of the patients; (4) incubation of AML-BM cells with LAK cells lead to a reduction of clonal, rearranged cells in 11 of 17 AML cases in complete remission, but only in 2 of 6 cases at diagnosis or relapse; (5) AML cells can be sensitized to theLAK cell treatment by preincubation of AML-BM cells with cytokines (IL-1beta, IL-3, IL-6, SCF, EPO and GM-CSF) or by adding SCF to the coculture conditions. Southern blot analysis and flow cytometry are appropriate methods to detect and quantify leukemic disease. Cytokines and LAK cells synergize to kill AML blasts in vitro.

This is accomplished by the specific dephosphorylation of key residues by the cdc25C phosphatase. The polo-like kinases are a family of serine/threonine kinases which are also implicated in the control of mitotic events, but their exact regulatory mechanism is not known. Recently, a Xenopus homologue, PLX1, was reported to phosphorylate and activate cdc25, leading to activation of cdc2/cyclin B. Jurkat T leukemia cells were chemically arrested and used to verify that PLK protein expression and its phosphorylation state is regulated with respect to cell cycle phase (i.e., protein is undetectable at G1/S, accumulates at S phase and is modified at G2/M). Herein, we show for the first time that endogenous human PLK protein immunoprecipitated from the G2/M-arrested Jurkat cells directly phosphorylates human cdc25C. In addition, we demonstrate that recombinant human (rh) PLK also phosphorylates rhcdc25C in a time- and concentration-dependent manner. Phosphorylation of endogenous cdc25C and recombinant cdc25C by PLK resulted in the activation of the phosphatase as assessed by dephosphorylation of cdc2/cyclin B. These data are the first to demonstrate that human PLK is capable of phosphorylating and positively regulating human cdc25C activity, allowing cdc25C to dephosphorylate inactive cdc2/cyclin B. As this event is required for cell cycle progression, we define at least one key regulatory mode of action for human PLK in the initiation of mitosis.","['Roshak, A K', 'Capper, E A', 'Imburgia, C', 'Fornwald, J', 'Scott, G', 'Marshall, L A']","['Roshak AK', 'Capper EA', 'Imburgia C', 'Fornwald J', 'Scott G', 'Marshall LA']","['Department of Immunology, SmithKline Beecham Phamaceuticals, King of Prussia, PA 19406, USA.

The 3 unusual tumors that represent the focus of this discussion are the ovarian-type epithelial tumors (OTET), the desmoplastic small round cell tumor (DSRCT), and the melanotic neuroectodermal tumor of infancy (MNTI). The OTETs are testicular homologues of their more common namesake counterparts that arise in the ovary. Most frequent of these are serous tumors of borderline malignancy, with fewer cases of serous carcinomas or other forms of mullerian differentiation. DSRCT is an increasingly recognized, aggressive, ""small blue cell"" neoplasm with distinctive clinical and pathologic features. These polyphenotypic tumors characteristically, but not invariably, arise in intimate association with the serosal membrane of the peritoneal cavity and harbor a signature translocation-t(11;22)(p13,q12). In the paratestis they often involve the surface of the epididymis. The MNTI is an enigmatic, histologically distinctive, low-grade neoplasm occasionally encountered in the epididymis. Recognition of its features is essential to avoid misdiagnosis as a more aggressive ""small blue cell"" neoplasm and consequent therapeutic mismanagement. Primary hematopoietic tumors of the paratesticular structures are rare. There appears to be a tendency for young men to have low-grade lymphomas with an indolent course and older patients to develop higher-grade tumors. Plasmacytoma and granulocytic sarcoma of the paratestis are even more rare and are often susceptible to misinterpretation. Finally, metastatic tumors and a variety of other very rare neoplasms are discussed.","['Henley, J D', 'Ferry, J', 'Ulbright, T M']","['Henley JD', 'Ferry J', 'Ulbright TM']","['Department of Pathology, Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Semin Diagn Pathol,Seminars in diagnostic pathology,8502262,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Carcinoma, Small Cell/chemistry/pathology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/pathology', 'Lymphoma/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Metastasis/pathology', 'Neoplasms, Connective Tissue/chemistry/pathology', 'Neoplasms, Glandular and Epithelial/pathology', 'Neuroectodermal Tumor, Melanotic/pathology', 'Plasmacytoma/pathology', 'Testicular Neoplasms/*pathology']",104,2001/02/24 12:00,2001/03/27 10:01,['2001/02/24 12:00'],"['2001/02/24 12:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/27 10:01 [medline]', '2001/02/24 12:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Semin Diagn Pathol. 2000 Nov;17(4):319-39.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We examined whether the retinoid receptor-specific thyroid hormone action is present during differentiation of HL-60 cells in this study. We used two distinct retinoid receptor agonists. T3 potentiates G1 arrest induced by Am80, a retinoic acid receptor (RAR)-specific agonist, but had no effect on G1 arrest induced by HX600, a retinoid x receptor (RXR)-specific agonist. Am80 alone induces the apoptosis, and T3 enhances it. Although HX600 alone fails to increase the apoptotic fraction, T3 enables the compounds to induce apoptosis. Am80-induced expression of CD11b, a marker for the differentiation, is enhanced by T3. However, T3 or HX600 or both do not affect the expression of CD11b. T3 does not alter the amount of mRNAs of various members of the bcl-2 family. T3, however, enhances the Am80-induced expression of bfl-1 and suppression of bcl-2. In contrast, T3 does not alter either bfl-1 and bcl-2 expression in the presence of HX600. Our observations suggest that cooperative action of T3 with an RXR-specific ligand is different from that with an RAR ligand in cellular apoptotic regulation and that thyroid hormone may be available as a chemotherapeutic agent in acute leukemia.","['Hara, M', 'Suzuki, S', 'Mori, J', 'Yamashita, K', 'Kumagai, M', 'Sakuma, T', 'Kakizawa, T', 'Takeda, T', 'Miyamoto, T', 'Ichikawa, K', 'Hashizume, K']","['Hara M', 'Suzuki S', 'Mori J', 'Yamashita K', 'Kumagai M', 'Sakuma T', 'Kakizawa T', 'Takeda T', 'Miyamoto T', 'Ichikawa K', 'Hashizume K']","['Department of Aging Medicine and Geriatrics, Shinshu University School of Medicine, Matsumoto, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Thyroid,Thyroid : official journal of the American Thyroid Association,9104317,"['0 (Benzoates)', '0 (CD11 Antigens)', '0 (Dibenzazepines)', '0 (Ligands)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Retinoic Acid)', '0 (Retinoid X Receptors)', '0 (Tetrahydronaphthalenes)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '06LU7C9H1V (Triiodothyronine)', '08V52GZ3H9 (tamibarotene)', '172705-89-4 (HX 600)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Benzoates/pharmacology', 'CD11 Antigens/genetics', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Dibenzazepines/pharmacology', 'Drug Synergism', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Gene Expression/drug effects', 'HL-60 Cells/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Ligands', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'Receptors, Retinoic Acid/*agonists', 'Retinoid X Receptors', 'Tetrahydronaphthalenes/pharmacology', 'Transcription Factors/*agonists', 'Tretinoin/*pharmacology', 'Triiodothyronine/*pharmacology']",,2001/02/24 12:00,2001/03/10 10:01,['2001/02/24 12:00'],"['2001/02/24 12:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/10 10:01 [medline]', '2001/02/24 12:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Thyroid. 2000 Dec;10(12):1023-34. doi: 10.1089/thy.2000.10.1023.,,,['10.1089/thy.2000.10.1023 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

MATERIAL AND METHODS: Thirteen patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) were treated in the Hematological Clinic of the Higher Medical Institute in Plovdiv in 1996-1998. All of them received a standard induction therapy with cytosin arabinoside + daunorubicin (7 + 3 days). During the first neutropenic phase (neutrophils < 0.5 x 10(9)/l) G-CSF filgrastim was applied (5 microg/kg/day, s.c.) until a recovery of the neutrophil count reached > 1.0 x 10(9)/l and was maintained for 3 successive days. The control group consisting of patients matched by age, gender, an AML cytomorphologic variant was given the same therapy but filgrastim. RESULTS: The study group showed quicker recovery of the neutrophil count (12.6 vs 16.8 days), reduced febrile period (9.8 vs 12.4 days) and shorter duration of parenteral antibiotic treatment (9.8 vs 12.4 days) compared to controls. No statistically significant difference between both groups was found in the duration of the antimycotic treatment (p > 0.05). No cytological signs of aggravation of basic disease were absent in patients who received filgrastim.

MATERIAL AND METHODS: Antigens of class I and class II genes were determined by microlymphocytotoxic test and DNA typing (PCR-SSP) in 30 patients with acute myeloblastic leukemia (AML), 47 patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), 52 patients with chronic myeloblastic leukemia (CML), 58 patients with lymphogranulomatosis (LGM) and 224 donors. RESULTS: HLA specificities were elucidated frequency of which was high in all the above nosological entities: Cw7 (RR 2.5 to 5.22), DRB1*11 (RR 2.3 to 4.88). Frequency of antigen B5 was high in three diseases (RR 2.14-2.6). A number of specificities have distribution deviations typical for only one or two diseases (A19--AML and CML, B27--ALL, DRB1*08--AML). The HLA-gene was detected the frequency of which was low in three diseases--DRB1*07 (RR 0.39 to 0.11). Individual preventive HLA genes for AML, ALL, LGM were A2, B8; A1, B8, B40; DRB1*01, respectively. CONCLUSION: Cw7, DRB1*11, B5 are HLA-specificities marking hemopoiesis predisposition to malignant transformation in general. Development into a certain nosological entity depends on combination of general HLA-genes with markers of individual hemoblastosis. DRB1*07 is a general preventive gene.

METHODS: Consecutively diagnosed cases of AML (N=333) and 1 population referent per case were retrospectively included in the study. Information on worktasks, companies, and leisure-time activities was obtained with telephone interviews. Exposure probability and intensity were assessed by occupational hygienists. Associations were evaluated with logistic regression. RESULTS: Exposure to organic solvents was associated with an increased risk of AML [low exposure: OR 1.5 (95% confidence interval (95% CI) 1.0-2.3, moderate-high exposure: OR 2.3 (95% CI 1.0-5.0)]. For exposure to solvents, but not to benzene, the OR was 1.2 (95% CI 0.69-2.0) for ""low"" and 2.7 (95% CI 1.0-7.3) for ""moderate-high"" exposure. The observed effects increased with intensity and duration of exposure. The estimated effects were higher for patients >60 years of age at the time of diagnosis. The effect of exposure to organic solvents was not differential with regard to morphology [except possibly erythroleukemia: OR 4.2, 95% CI 1.0-17 or the presence of CCA in general]. No increased risk for AML with complex CCA or with total or partial losses of chromosomes 5 or 7 were observed, but a higher risk was found for AML with trisomy 8 (OR 11, 95% CI 2.7-42) as the sole aberration. CONCLUSIONS: Exposure to organic solvents was associated with an increased risk of AML. This association was not due to benzene exposure alone and may be modified by age. Furthermore, specific associations with trisomy 8, and possibly also erythroleukemia, were suggested.","['Albin, M', 'Bjork, J', 'Welinder, H', 'Tinnerberg, H', 'Mauritzson, N', 'Johansson, B', 'Billstrom, R', 'Stromberg, U', 'Mikoczy, Z', 'Ahlgren, T', 'Nilsson, P G', 'Mitelman, F', 'Hagmar, L']","['Albin M', 'Bjork J', 'Welinder H', 'Tinnerberg H', 'Mauritzson N', 'Johansson B', 'Billstrom R', 'Stromberg U', 'Mikoczy Z', 'Ahlgren T', 'Nilsson PG', 'Mitelman F', 'Hagmar L']","['Department of Occupational and Environmental Medicine, Lund University Hospital, Sweden. maria.albin@ymed.lu.se']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Finland,Scand J Work Environ Health,"Scandinavian journal of work, environment & health",7511540,"['0 (Organic Chemicals)', '0 (Solvents)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', '*Chromosome Aberrations', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*chemically induced/epidemiology/*genetics', 'Occupational Exposure', 'Organic Chemicals/*adverse effects', 'Solvents/*adverse effects', 'Sweden/epidemiology']",,2001/02/24 12:00,2001/04/17 10:01,['2001/02/24 12:00'],"['2001/02/24 12:00 [pubmed]', '2001/04/17 10:01 [medline]', '2001/02/24 12:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Scand J Work Environ Health. 2000 Dec;26(6):482-91. doi: 10.5271/sjweh.572.,,,"['572 [pii]', '10.5271/sjweh.572 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Abdominal CT scan revealed multiple low-density areas in the liver, suggestive of abscess formation. Grocott staining of a liver biopsy sample revealed granuloma and fungus. The patient was treated with intravenous amphotericin B (AMPH-B) without success. AMPH-B was then administered via a catheter placed in the portal vein on January 6, 1997, and an additional catheter placed in the hepatic artery on March 28. AMPH-B was administered through both catheters for more than two months, but later substituted by fluconazole because of renal impairment. On September 10, allogeneic bone marrow transplantation from the patient's HLA-identical brother was performed, despite persistence of the abnormal CT findings. Acute grade III GVHD developed, but there was no evidence of reactivation of the liver abscesses. This case demonstrates that a prior fungal liver abscess is not an absolute contraindication for BMT if prophylactic antifungal drugs are administered and careful observation is conducted.","['Takahashi, N', 'Maruta, A', 'Hashimoto, C', 'Kato, K', 'Tanabe, J', 'Kodama, F', 'Oba, R', 'Harada, H', 'Omine, M']","['Takahashi N', 'Maruta A', 'Hashimoto C', 'Kato K', 'Tanabe J', 'Kodama F', 'Oba R', 'Harada H', 'Omine M']","['Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, Showa University Fujigaoka Hospital.']",['jpn'],"['Case Reports', 'English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Japan,Rinsho Ketsueki,[Rinsho ketsueki] The Japanese journal of clinical hematology,2984782R,"['0 (Antifungal Agents)', '7XU7A7DROE (Amphotericin B)', '8VZV102JFY (Fluconazole)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Amphotericin B/administration & dosage', 'Antifungal Agents/therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', '*Blast Crisis', '*Bone Transplantation', 'Fluconazole/therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*pathology/*therapy', 'Liver Abscess/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Mycoses/*drug therapy', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",,2001/02/24 12:00,2001/03/17 10:01,['2001/02/24 12:00'],"['2001/02/24 12:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/17 10:01 [medline]', '2001/02/24 12:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Rinsho Ketsueki. 2000 Dec;41(12):1247-53.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The resulting uncertainty distributions in the relative risk model parameters were used to derive uncertainties in population cancer risks for a current UK population. Following an assumed administered dose of 1 Sv, leukaemia mortality risks were estimated to be 1.93x10(-2) Sv(-1) (95% CI 1.14, 3.38), or 0.44 years of life lost Sv(-1) (95% CI 0.22, 0.94).

In general, solid cancer risks were very similar to those predicted by classical likelihood-based methods; however, leukaemia risks were somewhat higher, by 10-35%, than those predicted by classical likelihood-based methods. This is so in both cases, irrespective of whether or not adjustments are made in these likelihood-based fits for the effects of measurement errors, and the discrepancy for leukaemia tends to be greater at higher doses. Overall, cancer risks predicted by Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods are similar to those derived by classical likelihood-based methods and which form the basis of established estimates of radiation-induced cancer risk.","['Little, M P', 'Deltour, I', 'Richardson, S']","['Little MP', 'Deltour I', 'Richardson S']","['Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, Imperial College School of Medicine, London, UK. mark.little@ic.ac.uk']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",Germany,Radiat Environ Biophys,Radiation and environmental biophysics,0415677,,IM,"['Bayes Theorem', 'Calibration', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Radiation', 'England', 'Humans', 'Japan', 'Leukemia, Radiation-Induced/mortality', 'Likelihood Functions', 'Male', 'Markov Chains', 'Maximum Allowable Concentration', 'Models, Statistical', 'Monte Carlo Method', 'Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced/*mortality', '*Nuclear Warfare', 'Radiometry/methods', 'Reproducibility of Results', '*Risk', 'Survivors/statistics & numerical data', 'Wales']",,2001/02/24 12:00,2001/04/06 10:01,['2001/02/24 12:00'],"['2001/02/24 12:00 [pubmed]', '2001/04/06 10:01 [medline]', '2001/02/24 12:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Radiat Environ Biophys. 2000 Dec;39(4):241-52. doi: 10.1007/s004110000070.,,,['10.1007/s004110000070 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,['Radiat Environ Biophys 2001 Sep;40(3):236'],,,,,

Distribution of measurements, comparison of two methods for assessing exposure, and predictors for the occurrence of magnetic fields above background level.",233-40,"We examined the results of 1,835 magnetic field measurements in German residences conducted between November 1997 and September 1999. The measurements were part of an epidemiological study on the relationship between magnetic fields and childhood leukemia. We performed a fixed-location measurement of the magnetic field at 50 Hz and 16 2/3 Hz (frequency of the German railway system) over 24 h in the child's bedroom in the residence of each study participant. In addition, we conducted a second 24 h-measurement in the living room at 50 Hz, and spot measurements while walking through all rooms of the respective dwelling. Median 50 Hz magnetic fields above 0.2 muT were found to be infrequent in Germany (only 1.4% of all residences). Fields produced by high-voltage power lines (123-420 kV) were lower than expected: the median magnetic field was above 0.2 muT in only 8 (32.0%) of 25 residences located 50 m or closer to a high-voltage power line indicating that power lines in Germany are usually run well below the maximum power load. We found that magnetic fields were correlated with the type of residence and higher magnetic fields were measured in apartment buildings. There was also some evidence for a positive correlation between magnetic fields and traffic density and an inverse association between magnetic fields and family net income. The 24 h-magnetic field measurements correlated well with the spot measurements (r>0.7). However, when dichotomized with a cut-off point of 0.2 muT, there was only a poor agreement between the two measurement methods. A loss of the strength of the association after categorization was also observed when comparing the arithmetic mean and median of the same 24 h-measurement. In summary, these analyses give a valuable overview of magnetic field distributions in German residences.","['Schuz, J', 'Grigat, J P', 'Stormer, B', 'Rippin, G', 'Brinkmann, K', 'Michaelis, J']","['Schuz J', 'Grigat JP', 'Stormer B', 'Rippin G', 'Brinkmann K', 'Michaelis J']","['Institut fur Medizinische Statistik und Dokumentation, University of Mainz, Germany. schuez@imsd.uni-mainz.de']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Radiat Environ Biophys,Radiation and environmental biophysics,0415677,,IM,"['Child', '*Electromagnetic Fields', '*Environmental Exposure/analysis', 'Environmental Monitoring/*methods', 'Germany', '*Housing', 'Humans', 'Models, Statistical', 'Odds Ratio', 'Risk Factors', 'Time Factors']",,2001/02/24 12:00,2001/04/06 10:01,['2001/02/24 12:00'],"['2001/02/24 12:00 [pubmed]', '2001/04/06 10:01 [medline]', '2001/02/24 12:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Radiat Environ Biophys. 2000 Dec;39(4):233-40. doi: 10.1007/s004110000068.,,,['10.1007/s004110000068 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Since 4 days he had myalgia in both arms and legs. On examination only a tachycardia of 110/min was noticed. INVESTIGATIONS: Laboratory tests revealed hemoglobin 12.7 g/dl, leucocytes 10,300/microliter, platelets 89,000/microliter, LDH 191 U/l, sodium 134 mmol/l, potassium 2.76 mmol/l, calcium 4.52 mmol/l (I), creatinine 1.13 mg/dl, urea 72 mg/dl, uric acid 11.2 mg/dl. The levels of PTH (0 pg/ml), PTH-related peptide, vitamin D, vitamin A, IGF-1, STH, 5-HIES and interleukin 6 were within normal limits. TNF-alpha 25.9 pg/ml (< 8.1). The electrocardiography revealed a sinus rythm with a QT-time of 0.28 s (= 100%). Multiple osteolytic bone leasions were seen in thoracic CT-scan. Abdominal sonography showed normal liver structure, multiple subhepatic lymph nodes without splenomegaly. The cytologic examination of the bone marrow demonstrated a diffuse infiltration by a common acute leukemia. TREATMENT AND COURSE: The rehydration with physiologic saline (3500 ml/d) was initiated in the ICU. Furosemide was added for further renal excretion. Additionally prednisone (100 mg/d) and calcitonin (300 I.E./d) were given. The calcium level fell within two days. No cardiac arrhythmia nor acute renal failure were seen. After definitive diagnosing the patient was treated corresponding to a specific protocol. One year later the relapsing ALL was diagnosed also by hypercalcemia (5.9 mmol/l). The level of TNF-alpha before and after correction of hypercalcemia was 20 pg/ml. CONCLUSION: The acute treatment of hypercalcemia is independent of the underlying cause (rehydration with physiologic saline, renal excretion with furosemide, inhibition of osteoclastic activity). The main causes are hyperparathyreoidism or malignancys (90%). We describe TNF-alpha as a possible marker of tumoral load of a common ALL but we are not able to reveal a correlation between TNF-alpha and the calcium level.","['Schneider, T', 'Seydlitz, F', 'Zimmermann, U', 'Sontag, B', 'Boesken, W H']","['Schneider T', 'Seydlitz F', 'Zimmermann U', 'Sontag B', 'Boesken WH']","['II.

This report illustrates a case of a child who presented initially at age 2 and 1/2 years with psoriasis, juvenile rheumatoid arthritis-like symptoms, and neutropenia. Bone marrow examinations obtained throughout his course have demonstrated progressive hypercellularity with increased reticulin fibers and replacement of the normal marrow elements by lymphocytes, which were later identified as large granular lymphocytes.

In cells treated with TPA, the burst in ROS at 48 h was preceded by accumulation at 12 h of gp91phox (8.8-fold) and p47phox mRNA (threefold), whereas untreated cells contained steady-state levels of both transcripts. Time-course experiments with actinomycin D to inhibit transcription revealed that TPA did not improve the stability of gp91phox. In transient transfections, luciferase reporter activity directed from a 1.5-kb gp91phox promoter fragment was enhanced threefold upon treatment with TPA for 24 h. We conclude that TPA can commit HL-60 cells to differentiation and elicit transcription from the proximal gp91phox promoter.","['Samuelson, D J', 'Powell, M B', 'Lluria-Prevatt, M', 'Romagnolo, D F']","['Samuelson DJ', 'Powell MB', 'Lluria-Prevatt M', 'Romagnolo DF']","['Department of Nutritional Sciences, The University of Arizona, Tucson, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Leukoc Biol,Journal of leukocyte biology,8405628,"['0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Phorbols)', 'EC 1.6.3.- (CYBB protein, human)', 'EC 1.6.3.- (NADPH Oxidase 2)', 'EC 1.6.3.- (NADPH Oxidases)']",IM,"['Gene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic/*drug effects', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/*genetics', 'NADPH Oxidase 2', 'NADPH Oxidases/genetics/metabolism', 'Phorbols/*pharmacology', 'Transcriptional Activation/*drug effects']",,2001/02/24 12:00,2001/03/27 10:01,['2001/02/24 12:00'],"['2001/02/24 12:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/27 10:01 [medline]', '2001/02/24 12:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Leukoc Biol. 2001 Jan;69(1):161-8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Such vectors can be designed by placing a gene of therapeutic interest under the control of tissue-specific transcriptional elements. However, low titers and loss of specificity are frequently encountered with tissue-specific vectors. The aim of the present study was to develop a T cell-specific RV. METHODS: We constructed a series of Moloney murine leukemia virus (Mo-MLV)-based RVs expressing enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) under the control of a mini-promoter/enhancer cassette derived from the CD4 gene (CD4pmE) and tested them in cell lines and peripheral blood lymphocytes. Expression of EGFP was monitored by fluorescence microscopy and analyzed by flow cytometry. RESULTS: The CD4pmE cassette was inserted between the viral long terminal repeats (LTRs) in self-inactivating vectors (SIN vectors) or was substituted to the 3' U3 viral promoter/enhancer (hybrid vectors). High vector titers but poor specific expression of EGFP were achieved when CD4pmE was inserted in sense orientation in SIN vectors. Low titers but high specificity were observed when the CD4pmE cassette was in anti-sense orientation. In contrast, high titers and good T cell specificity were obtained with hybrid vectors. CONCLUSION: An efficient T cell-specific retroviral vector was obtained.","['Zhao-Emonet, J C', 'Marodon, G', 'Pioche-Durieu, C', 'Cosset, F L', 'Klatzmann, D']","['Zhao-Emonet JC', 'Marodon G', 'Pioche-Durieu C', 'Cosset FL', 'Klatzmann D']","['Laboratoire de Biologie et Therapeutique des Pathologies Immunitaires UPMC-CNRS ESA 7087-CERVI-H pital de la Pitie, Paris, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,J Gene Med,The journal of gene medicine,9815764,"['0 (CD4 Antigens)', '0 (DNA, Recombinant)', '0 (Luminescent Proteins)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '147336-22-9 (Green Fluorescent Proteins)']",IM,"['3T3 Cells', 'Animals', 'CD4 Antigens/*genetics', 'DNA, Recombinant', '*Enhancer Elements, Genetic', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genetic Vectors/genetics', 'Green Fluorescent Proteins', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Luminescent Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/*genetics', '*Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'T-Lymphocytes/cytology/*metabolism/virology', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,2001/02/24 12:00,2001/03/07 10:01,['2001/02/24 12:00'],"['2001/02/24 12:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/07 10:01 [medline]', '2001/02/24 12:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Gene Med. 2000 Nov-Dec;2(6):416-25. doi: 10.1002/1521-2254(200011/12)2:6<416::AID-JGM142>3.0.CO;2-Y.,,,['10.1002/1521-2254(200011/12)2:6<416::AID-JGM142>3.0.CO;2-Y [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

For the success of several gene therapeutic approaches (ADA, HIV) it is important to effectively transduce primary human CD4+ T lymphocytes. METHODS: We have used retroviral vectors encoding the enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) as a marker gene and carrying envelopes of MLV-10A1, A-MLV and GaLV and have analyzed the transduction efficiency of both human CD4+ T cell lines (CEM, H9, HUT78, J16) and primary human CD4+ T lymphocytes using a RetroNectin-assisted transduction protocol and virus-containing supernatant. RESULTS: In CD4+ T cell lines the MLV-10A1 vector pseudotype was most effective and infected up to 85% of cells which then stably expressed GFP over time. MLV-10A1 was also superior and infected approximately 32% of primary human CD4+ T lymphocytes in comparison to GaLV (18%) and A-MLV (12%). The superior efficiency of MLV-10A1 for the transduction of CD4+ T cells correlates with the longer half-life of this pseudotype in comparison to A-MLV and, as previously shown by interference analysis, with the usage of both the A-MLV (Pit2) and the GaLV receptor (Pitl) for cell entry. CONCLUSIONS: MLV-10A1 is a suitable vector for transferring genes with high efficacy into primary human CD4+ T lymphocytes. The use of MLV-10A1 pseudotyped vectors should make it easier to obtain a sufficient number of gene-modified T lymphocytes for an adoptive transfer.","['Gladow, M', 'Becker, C', 'Blankenstein, T', 'Uckert, W']","['Gladow M', 'Becker C', 'Blankenstein T', 'Uckert W']","['Max-Delbruck-Center for Molecular Medicine, Berlin, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,J Gene Med,The journal of gene medicine,9815764,"['0 (Luminescent Proteins)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '147336-22-9 (Green Fluorescent Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/cytology/*metabolism/virology', 'Cell Line', 'Gene Transfer Techniques', 'Genetic Vectors/genetics', 'Green Fluorescent Proteins', 'Humans', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*genetics', 'Luminescent Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,2001/02/24 12:00,2001/03/07 10:01,['2001/02/24 12:00'],"['2001/02/24 12:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/07 10:01 [medline]', '2001/02/24 12:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Gene Med. 2000 Nov-Dec;2(6):409-15. doi: 10.1002/1521-2254(200011/12)2:6<409::AID-JGM144>3.0.CO;2-K.,,,['10.1002/1521-2254(200011/12)2:6<409::AID-JGM144>3.0.CO;2-K [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

There are two types of PKA, type I (PKA-I) and type II (PKA-II), which share a common catalytic subunit but contain distinct regulatory subunits, RI and RII, respectively. Evidence suggests that increased expression of RIalpha/PKA-I correlates with neoplastic cell growth. Here, we show that sequence-specific oligonucleotide inhibition of RIalpha expression results in inhibition of growth and modulation of cAMP signaling in cancer cells. The antisense promoted growth inhibition in a time-dependent, concentration-dependent, and sequence-dependent manner in human cancer cells in monolayer culture, and it inhibited colony formation in soft agar and tumor growth in nude mice. Among the cancer cells are LS-174T, HCT-15, and Colo-205 colon carcinoma cells; A-549 lung carcinoma cells; LNCaP prostate adenocarcinoma cells; Molt-4 leukemia cells; and Jurkat T lymphoma cells. Northern blot and immunoprecipitation analyses revealed that the growth inhibitory effect of the antisense correlated with a decrease in RIalpha expression at both the mRNA and protein levels. Pulse-chase experiments revealed that the antisense-directed inhibition of RIalpha expression resulted in compensatory changes in expression of the isoforms of R and C subunits and cAMP signaling in a cell type-specific manner. These results demonstrate that cAMP is ubiquitous in the regulation of cell growth and that the antisense oligonucleotide, which inhibits the synthesis of the RIalpha subunit of PKA, can be targeted to a single gene for treatment of cancer in a variety of cell types.","['Nesterova, M', 'Cho-Chung, Y S']","['Nesterova M', 'Cho-Chung YS']","['Cellular Biochemistry Section, Laboratory of Tumor Immunology and Biology, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892-1750, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Antisense Nucleic Acid Drug Dev,Antisense & nucleic acid drug development,9606142,"[""0 (3' Untranslated Regions)"", '0 (Cyclic AMP-Dependent Protein Kinase RIalpha Subunit)', '0 (DNA, Antisense)', '0 (Oligonucleotides, Antisense)', '0 (PRKAR1A protein, human)', '0 (RNA, Antisense)', 'E0399OZS9N (Cyclic AMP)', 'EC 2.7.11.11 (Cyclic AMP-Dependent Protein Kinase Type II)', 'EC 2.7.11.11 (Cyclic AMP-Dependent Protein Kinases)', ""EC 3.1.4.17 (3',5'-Cyclic-AMP Phosphodiesterases)""]",IM,"[""3' Untranslated Regions/drug effects/genetics"", ""3',5'-Cyclic-AMP Phosphodiesterases/drug effects/metabolism"", 'Biological Transport', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cyclic AMP/physiology', 'Cyclic AMP-Dependent Protein Kinase RIalpha Subunit', 'Cyclic AMP-Dependent Protein Kinase Type II', 'Cyclic AMP-Dependent Protein Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics', 'DNA, Antisense/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Enzyme Stability', 'Gene Expression/*drug effects', 'Gene Targeting', 'Humans', 'Oligonucleotides, Antisense/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'RNA, Antisense/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,2001/02/24 12:00,2001/03/07 10:01,['2001/02/24 12:00'],"['2001/02/24 12:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/07 10:01 [medline]', '2001/02/24 12:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Antisense Nucleic Acid Drug Dev. 2000 Dec;10(6):423-33. doi: 10.1089/oli.1.2000.10.423.,,,['10.1089/oli.1.2000.10.423 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, limitations to the antisense approach remain, such as (1) difficulties in delivery of the AS-ODN into target tissues, (2) instability of AS-ODN in vivo, (3) uncertanties about the precise mode of action, and (4) toxic effects in animal and human studies. To circumvent some of these difficulties, we designed a vector set that directs the in vivo production of single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) of a desired target sequence with limited extraneous vector nucleotide sequences. One plasmid was designed to express Moloney murine leukemia virus (MoMuLV) reverse transcriptase (RT). Another expression plasmid contains the MoMuLV primer binding site at the 3'-end of its RNA transcript so that an ssDNA would be synthesized by RT when both plasmids are cotransfected into cells. To test this expression system, we constructed a plasmid set, pssXA/pssXB that produces ssRNA-cleaving DNA 10-23 enzyme (Santoro, S.W., and Joyce, G.F. [1997]. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

These plasmids were transfected into the A549 lung carcinoma cell line. Reduced C-raf mRNA levels by up to 34%-36%, as determined by Northern blot analysis, were observed in the transfected cells. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of using this novel ssDNA expression system to generate any sequence of interest in vivo for antisense, RNA-cleavage DNA enzyme, or triplex-forming strategies.","['Chen, Y', 'Ji, Y J', 'Roxby, R', 'Conrad, C']","['Chen Y', 'Ji YJ', 'Roxby R', 'Conrad C']","['InGene, Inc., Kansas City, MO 64108, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Antisense Nucleic Acid Drug Dev,Antisense & nucleic acid drug development,9606142,"['0 (DNA, Antisense)', '0 (DNA, Single-Stranded)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-raf)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase)', 'EC 3.1.21.1 (Deoxyribonuclease I)']",IM,"['DNA, Antisense/*pharmacology', 'DNA, Single-Stranded/*biosynthesis/genetics/pharmacology', 'Deoxyribonuclease I/*metabolism', 'Gene Silencing/drug effects', 'Gene Targeting', 'Genetic Vectors', 'Humans', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-raf/antagonists & inhibitors/*genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/drug effects/metabolism', 'RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase/metabolism', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,2001/02/24 12:00,2001/03/07 10:01,['2001/02/24 12:00'],"['2001/02/24 12:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/07 10:01 [medline]', '2001/02/24 12:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Antisense Nucleic Acid Drug Dev. 2000 Dec;10(6):415-22. doi: 10.1089/oli.1.2000.10.415.,,,['10.1089/oli.1.2000.10.415 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the neuronal nuclei harboring NIIs, promyelocytic leukemia protein (PML) nuclear bodies were redistributed into a single NII, and the CREB (cAMP-responsive element-binding protein)-binding protein was also recruited into NIIs. The results suggest that the novel lesion distribution revealed by the diffuse nuclear labeling may be responsible for a variety of clinical features, such as dementia and epilepsy in DRPLA, and that certain transcriptional abnormalities may be induced secondarily in neuronal nuclei with the formation of NIIs.","['Yamada, M', 'Wood, J D', 'Shimohata, T', 'Hayashi, S', 'Tsuji, S', 'Ross, C A', 'Takahashi, H']","['Yamada M', 'Wood JD', 'Shimohata T', 'Hayashi S', 'Tsuji S', 'Ross CA', 'Takahashi H']","['Department of Pathology, Brain Research Institute, Niigata University, Japan. nori@bri.niigata-u.ac.jp']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Ann Neurol,Annals of neurology,7707449,"['0 (Nerve Tissue Proteins)', '0 (atrophin-1)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Brain/*pathology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Male', 'Myoclonic Epilepsies, Progressive/*pathology', 'Nerve Tissue Proteins/*analysis', 'Neurons/*pathology']",,2001/02/24 12:00,2001/03/03 10:01,['2001/02/24 12:00'],"['2001/02/24 12:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/03 10:01 [medline]', '2001/02/24 12:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Ann Neurol. 2001 Jan;49(1):14-23. doi: 10.1002/1531-8249(200101)49:1<14::aid-ana5>3.0.co;2-x.,,,['10.1002/1531-8249(200101)49:1<14::aid-ana5>3.0.co;2-x [doi]'],,"['N 34172/PHS HHS/United States', 'NS16375/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States', 'NS38144/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Current region-of-interest-based techniques for the kinetic analysis of these images rely on user selection and drawing of regions to be analyzed. Such analyses do not reveal unexpected kinetic activity outside of the selected regions of interest and do not provide a whole-image assessment regarding the pharmacokinetics of an agent. At Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, a method for generating images in which the pixel value represents a kinetic parameter has been developed. This work extends the method into a new application in which whole-body parametric images are used to examine the kinetics of Bi213-HuM195 in patients with leukemia. METHODS: Bi213-HuM195 is typically administered in multiple injections over 2-4 d, yielding a progressive increase in the amount of antibody administered. Patients are injected with individual doses while positioned in a gamma camera, and imaging is initiated at the start of the injection. The acquisition is performed in dynamic mode with images collected at several time intervals over 1 h. Using software developed in-house, images are corrected for patient movement through iterative alignments, decay corrected, and summed to yield a series of images over regular time intervals. Parametric rate images are obtained by fitting a linear expression to the counts in each pixel. In this study, rate images from a patient's first injection were compared with rate images from the last injection. RESULTS: The conventional planar images of antibody distribution showed significant uptake in liver, spleen, and marrow, whereas the generated rate images displayed different patterns, sometimes with negative values in liver and spleen and positive values in marrow, reflecting clearance and uptake rates rather than total accumulation. The impact of the progressive increase in antibody administration was observed by comparing the first with the last rate images. Interpatient comparisons were also made and showed that rate image patterns varied depending on patient-specific conditions such as the amount of disease and previous therapies undergone by the patient. CONCLUSION: Rate images make it possible to succinctly display kinetic information about an agent's behavior over the entire acquired image.","['Kolbert, K S', 'Hamacher, K A', 'Jurcic, J G', 'Scheinberg, D A', 'Larson, S M', 'Sgouros, G']","['Kolbert KS', 'Hamacher KA', 'Jurcic JG', 'Scheinberg DA', 'Larson SM', 'Sgouros G']","['Department of Medical Physics Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York 10021, USA.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Clinical Trial, Phase I', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Nucl Med,"Journal of nuclear medicine : official publication, Society of Nuclear Medicine",0217410,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Radioisotopes)', 'U015TT5I8H (Bismuth)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/therapeutic use', 'Bismuth/therapeutic use', 'Gamma Cameras', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*radiotherapy', '*Radioimmunotherapy', 'Radioisotopes/therapeutic use']",,2001/02/24 12:00,2001/03/03 10:01,['2001/02/24 12:00'],"['2001/02/24 12:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/03 10:01 [medline]', '2001/02/24 12:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Nucl Med. 2001 Jan;42(1):27-32.,,,,,"['P01CA33049/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01CA55349/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01CA62444/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,

We found gains in chromosomal region 1q21-q22 and 13q12-q14 to be related to the drug-resistant phenotype in ovarian cancer patients. Several genes encoding transcription factors, oncogenes, cell cycle regulators and regulators of the apoptotic pathway are found to be located on these regions of the chromosomes, and these genes are potential modulators for toxic insults in cancer cells.

DATA SOURCES: A systematic MEDLINE search of the English-language literature (1995-April 2000) was performed to identify all randomized trials evaluating CSF use in acute leukemia. The following search terms were used: granulocyte colony-stimulating factor, filgrastim, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, sargramostim, acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), acute myelogenous leukemia (AML), acute nonlymphocytic leukemia, and acute myeloid leukemia. The references from relevant literature were also examined in order to identify reports not discovered in the MEDLINE search. DATA SYNTHESIS: Six randomized trials in pediatric ALL, nine in adult AML, and four in adult ALL have examined the safety and efficacy of the CSFs. Two of the pediatric trials supported a reduction in either the duration of hospitalization or in the incidence of febrile neutropenia when a CSF was employed during the consolidation or intensification phase of chemotherapy. The remaining pediatric trials failed to demonstrate a clinical benefit. In adult AML, eight of the nine trials showed a significant decrease in the time to neutrophil recovery when a CSF was used. Only one of these trials demonstrated a decrease in hospital stay and none showed a decreased incidence of infection for patients who received a CSF. Three of the four trials in adult ALL demonstrated the efficacy of a CSF in decreasing the number of days to neutrophil recovery. Only one trial demonstrated that a CSF led to a reduction in the number of hospital days. Trials in children or adults have not demonstrated that the CSFs influence the long-term outcome of patients with acute leukemia. CONCLUSIONS: The published studies document a decrease in the time to recovery from neutropenia when patients with acute leukemia are treated with a CSF. However, a consistent reduction in infectious complications or in the duration of hospitalization has not been demonstrated when a CSF is used for either pediatric or adult patients. Very limited data exist to support the premise that CSFs meet the criteria established by the American Society of Clinical Oncology for demonstrating the value of these agents. Further careful study focused on resource utilization and pharmacoeconomics may help to elucidate how healthcare institutions may most effectively employ CSFs to treat patients with acute leukemia.","['Holdsworth, M T', 'Mathew, P']","['Holdsworth MT', 'Mathew P']","['College of Pharmacy and Department of Pediatrics, University of New Mexico, Albuquerque, NM 87131-5691, USA. markt@unm.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Ann Pharmacother,The Annals of pharmacotherapy,9203131,['0 (Colony-Stimulating Factors)'],IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Child', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Colony-Stimulating Factors/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/drug therapy', 'Meta-Analysis as Topic', 'Middle Aged', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy', 'Treatment Outcome']",36,2001/02/24 12:00,2001/03/10 10:01,['2001/02/24 12:00'],"['2001/02/24 12:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/10 10:01 [medline]', '2001/02/24 12:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Ann Pharmacother. 2001 Jan;35(1):92-108. doi: 10.1345/aph.19117.,,,['10.1345/aph.19117 [doi]'],,,,['Ann Pharmacother. 2001 Jan;35(1):120-2.

Our nonmyeloablative regimen was well tolerated by older patients at high risk of regimen-related toxicity by the conventional conditioning regimen but was immunosuppressive enough to achieve mixed chimerism. After allo-PBSCT, we monitored chimerism in these patients by fluorescence in situ hybridization using X- and Y-specific probes and polymerase chain reaction-based analysis of a variable number of tandem repeats. We found that full chimerism and graft-versus-leukemia (GVL) effects could be induced in these patients by donor lymphocyte infusions and withdrawal of posttransplantation immunosuppressive therapy.

The function of P-gp is thought to be the extrusion of anticancer drugs from the cell against a concentration gradient. In acute myelogenous leukemia (AML), P-gp expression in leukemic blast cells at initial presentation has been reported to be 20% to 40%. The remission rate of acute leukemia patients is significantly lower in P-gp+ patients than in P-gp- patients. A significantly shorter survival and relapse-free survival in P-gp+ AML patients compared with P-gp- patients has been reported. Intracellular daunorubicin/Rhodamine123 content in P-gp+ leukemic blast cells is significantly lower than in P-gp- leukemic blast cells. By using a leukemic blast colony assay, lowered sensitivity to the anticancer drug was revealed not only in leukemic blast cells but also in leukemic progenitors. One method to overcome MDR with a possibility of clinical application is to use drugs that interfere with the function of P-gp. The addition of MS-209 in vitro as an MDR-reversing agent significantly enhanced the intracellular daunorubicin/Rhodamine 123 accumulation and the retention of P-gp+ leukemic blast cells to a level similar to that of P-gp- blast cells.

The hallmarks of the chronic cutaneous involvement in this syndrome are inflammation and fibrosis of the fascia. To determine how the inflammatory process in EF may be regulated, we investigated the spontaneous and mitogen induced [lipopolysaccharide (LPS), phytohemagglutinin (PHA) or both LPS+PHA] syntheses of interleukins (IL)-2, 5 and 10, interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma), and leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) cytokines by peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from 4 patients with active EF and compared them to those of 10 healthy individuals. METHODS: We used a short term whole blood assay and culture supernatants were collected after 24 h to measure the IL-2 and IFN-gamma contents and after 48 h to evaluate IL-5, IL-10, and LIF. Supernatant cytokine concentrations were determined by ELISA. RESULTS: All 4 patients had similar patterns of cytokine secretion. Cytokine production did not differ between patients and controls under basal conditions or when LPS was added to the cultures. In contrast, under PHA or LPS+PHA stimulation, significantly higher amounts of all 5 cytokines were detected in samples from patients compared to those from controls. CONCLUSION: Overall, our data suggest that EF is characterized by an increased capacity of PBMC to produce IL-5 and IL-10, possibly leading to eosinophilia and immune globulin overexpression. In this context, the simultaneous elevations of type 1 cytokines (IL-2 and IFN-gamma) and LIF production by the same cells may be an attempt by the immune system to limit the exacerbation of a type 2 dominant response.","['Viallard, J F', 'Taupin, J L', 'Ranchin, V', 'Leng, B', 'Pellegrin, J L', 'Moreau, J F']","['Viallard JF', 'Taupin JL', 'Ranchin V', 'Leng B', 'Pellegrin JL', 'Moreau JF']","['Service de Medicine Interne et Maladies Infectieuses, H pital Haut-Leveque, Pessac, France.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Canada,J Rheumatol,The Journal of rheumatology,7501984,"['0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Interleukins)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lipopolysaccharides)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Mitogens)', '0 (Phytohemagglutinins)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Eosinophilia/*metabolism/pathology', 'Fasciitis/*metabolism/pathology', 'Female', 'Growth Inhibitors/immunology/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Interferon-gamma/biosynthesis/immunology', '*Interleukin-6', 'Interleukins/*biosynthesis/immunology', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/drug effects/immunology/metabolism', 'Lipopolysaccharides', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Lymphokines/immunology/*metabolism', 'Middle Aged', 'Mitogens/pharmacology', 'Phytohemagglutinins']",,2001/02/24 12:00,2001/03/07 10:01,['2001/02/24 12:00'],"['2001/02/24 12:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/07 10:01 [medline]', '2001/02/24 12:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Rheumatol. 2001 Jan;28(1):75-80.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), a highly characterized, cell surface glycoprotein overexpressed by various tumor cells, provides a specific tool for tumor tissue-specific targeting by retroviral vectors. The conventional suicidal gene delivery systems need additional drugs other than their gene products. The inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) gene product yields nitric oxide (NO), which directly induces autocytotoxicity and cytolysis of bystander cells. In the present study, we have developed a novel bifunctional Moloney murine leukemia virus-based recombinant retroviral vector that displays a chimeric envelope protein containing a single-chain variable fragmented (scFv) antibody to CEA and carries the iNOS gene in the genome. The resultant bifunctional retroviral vector showed a specific delivery of the iNOS gene to human CEA-expressing carcinoma cells, resulting in the direct and efficient killing of CEA-expressing carcinoma cells by induction of apoptosis. This is the first report of successful killing of CEA-expressing cells by specific targeting of the iNOS gene.

Giacomello et al., Biotechniques, 26: 758-762, 1999; P. Spessotto et al., Methods Mol. Biol., 139: 321-343, 2000). The use of previously characterized LN chain-specific antibodies showed that the vast majority of the smaller vascular compartments, known to correspond to sites of lymphocyte transmigration, expressed the subunits involved in the structuring of 9 of the 12 LN isoforms known to date. Eight LN isoforms (i.e., LN-1, -2, -4, -5, -8, -9, -10, and -11) and four naturally occurring LN complexes were isolated from various tissues and cultured cells by combined gel filtration, ion exchange, and immunoaffinity chromatographies, and the identity/composition of the isolated LNs/LN complexes was asserted by immunochemical means and amino-acid sequencing. Notwithstanding the widespread colocalization of LN isoforms, a panel of neoplastic B- and T-cell lines and lymphocytes isolated from patients affected by chronic lymphocytic B-cell leukemia attached preferentially and with high avidity to purified LN-8, purified LN-10, and LN-10-containing protein complexes, whereas lymphocytes derived from patients diagnosed with acute lymphocytic leukemia failed to bind to these LNs. All of the tested neoplastic lymphocytes failed to adhere to the isolated LN-1, LN-4, LN-9, and LN-11 and attached moderately well to purified LN-2 and LN-5. The interaction of transformed lymphocytes with LNs was cation-dependent and interchangeably mediated by the alpha3beta1 and alpha6beta1 integrins. The degree of engagement of the two LN receptors was dependent upon their relative levels of cell surface expression, whereas, irrespective of the phenotype, lymphocytes deprived of either of these receptors were incapable of LN binding. The findings suggest that LN-8 and LN-10 may act in an independent or complementary fashion as primary components of the endothelial basement membrane favoring the interaction of extravasating neoplastic lymphocytes. Thus, our results would demonstrate that different LN isoforms may evoke diverse cellular responses in different cell types and that this divergence may be the basis for the redundancy of LN distribution in a number of vascular structures.","['Spessotto, P', 'Yin, Z', 'Magro, G', 'Deutzmann, R', 'Chiu, A', 'Colombatti, A', 'Perris, R']","['Spessotto P', 'Yin Z', 'Magro G', 'Deutzmann R', 'Chiu A', 'Colombatti A', 'Perris R']","['Division for Experimental Oncology 2, National Cancer Institute CRO-IRCCS, Aviano, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Antibodies)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Integrins)', '0 (Laminin)', '0 (laminin 10)', '0 (laminin 8)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies/pharmacology', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'B-Lymphocytes/metabolism/*pathology', 'Basement Membrane/metabolism', 'Cattle', 'Cell Adhesion/physiology', 'Endothelium, Vascular/cytology/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Integrins/antagonists & inhibitors/immunology/metabolism', 'Laminin/immunology/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/pathology', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/pathology', 'Lymphoma, T-Cell/pathology', 'T-Lymphocytes/metabolism/*pathology']",,2001/02/24 12:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2001/02/24 12:00'],"['2001/02/24 12:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2001/02/24 12:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 2001 Jan 1;61(1):339-47.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Complete remission can be achieved with ATRA alone, but disease-free survival is still too short because of relapse. To overcome this drawback, ATRA has been used in combination with chemotherapeutic agents such as 1-beta-D-arabinofuranosylcytosine (araC) and daunorubicin. However, growth of the APL cell lines NB4 and HT93 is less sensitive to araC than to that of other myeloid leukemia cell lines such as HL-60 and U937. ATRA effectively induced granulocytic differentiation of NB4 and HT93 cells, whereas araC did not, even in a high concentration. A cytidine deaminase-resistant analogue of araC, 1-(2-deoxy-2-methylene-beta-D-erythro-pentofuranosyl)cytidine (DMDC), inhibited the growth of NB4 and HT-93 cells and was also effective on HL-60 and U937 cells. The promyelocytic cell lines were induced to differentiate by DMDC and other cytidine deaminase-resistant analogues. Among them, DMDC was the most potent in inducing differentiation and inhibiting the growth of NB4 cells. The ATRA-induced differentiation of NB4 cells was not augmented by araC, whereas combined treatment with ATRA and DMDC had more than additive effects in inducing the differentiation of NB4 cells. Similar results were observed in a primary culture of leukemia cells that had been freshly isolated from APL patients.

HL60/AD was found to have multiple resistance mechanisms. With regard to ara-C, HL60/AD cells showed decreased deoxycytidine kinase activity but did not show elevation of cytidine deaminase activity or a decrease in ara-C influx. With regard to daunorubicin, a decrease in topoisomerase II activity was found. A decrease in intracellular accumulation of daunorubicin was also found.

Interestingly, the resistance of HL60/AD cells not only to daunorubicin but also to ara-C was markedly reversed by treatment with L-buthionine-(S,R)-sulfoximine (BSO), a potent inhibitor of GSH synthesis. After exposure of HL60/AD to ara-C, mitochondrial membrane potential and reactive oxygen intermediates showed no significant change, but a considerable loss of mitochondrial membrane potential and an increase in reactive oxygen intermediate generation were caused by pre-incubation with BSO. Neither elevation of GSH nor reversal of resistance by BSO was found in ara-C-resistant HL60 cells that were selected only with ara-C. These findings suggest that in addition to the summation of the mechanisms of resistance to each agent reported previously, an increased level of GSH plays an important role in the cross-resistance induced in HL60/AD cells by simultaneous exposure to both drugs.","['Takemura, H', 'Urasaki, Y', 'Yoshida, A', 'Fukushima, T', 'Ueda, T']","['Takemura H', 'Urasaki Y', 'Yoshida A', 'Fukushima T', 'Ueda T']","['First Department of Internal Medicine, Fukui Medical University, Matsuoka, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters)', '0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (BCL2L1 protein, human)', '0 (Multidrug Resistance-Associated Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '0 (Topoisomerase I Inhibitors)', '0 (bcl-X Protein)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '5072-26-4 (Buthionine Sulfoximine)', 'EC 2.7.1.74 (Deoxycytidine Kinase)', 'EC 3.5.4.5 (Cytidine Deaminase)', 'EC 5.99.1.2 (DNA Topoisomerases, Type I)', 'GAN16C9B8O (Glutathione)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/biosynthesis', 'ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters/biosynthesis', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*pharmacology', 'Buthionine Sulfoximine/pharmacology', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology', 'Cytidine Deaminase/metabolism', 'DNA Fragmentation', 'DNA Topoisomerases, Type I/metabolism', 'Daunorubicin/administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology', 'Deoxycytidine Kinase/metabolism', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Interactions', '*Drug Resistance, Multiple', 'Glutathione/antagonists & inhibitors/biosynthesis', 'HL-60 Cells/cytology/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Intracellular Membranes/drug effects/physiology', 'Membrane Potentials/drug effects', 'Mitochondria/drug effects/physiology', 'Multidrug Resistance-Associated Proteins', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/biosynthesis', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism', 'Topoisomerase I Inhibitors', 'bcl-X Protein']",,2001/02/24 12:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2001/02/24 12:00'],"['2001/02/24 12:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2001/02/24 12:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 2001 Jan 1;61(1):172-7.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To determine the effects of this Bcr-Abl kinase inhibitor on chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) cells, we cloned BCR(64-413) into a recombinant, replication-defective adenovirus to express useful quantities of Bcr(64-413) in a wide variety of cells in culture. Infection of Cos1 cells with plaque-purified virus at a multiplicity of infection of 20-40 induced high expression of Bcr(64-413) as detected by Western blotting. Infection of hematopoietic cells at modest multiplicities of infection (20-40) required special conditions involving shifting cycling cells to a nongrowing condition involving serum starvation and cell crowding. Under these conditions, both Bcr-Abl-positive and -negative hematopoietic cells can be efficiently infected by adenovirus, as demonstrated by 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-beta-D-galactopyranoside staining of cells infected by beta-galactosidase (beta-GAL) adenovirus. We found that expression of Bcr(64-413) in Bcr-Abl-positive K562 and BV-173 cells, but not Bcr-Abl-negative SMS-SB cells, increased cell-cell clumping and inhibited cell growth. In contrast to the effects of the Bcr(64-413) adenovirus, the beta-GAL adenovirus, despite infecting both types of cells, did not block growth or increase cell-cell clumping of Bcr-Abl-positive and -negative hematopoietic cells. Expression of Bcr(64-413) protein in primary cultures of cells from CML patients with active disease interfered with cell growth, induced apoptosis (as measured by annexin staining), and increased cell-cell clumping, whereas the beta-GAL adenovirus and mock-infected cells lacked these effects. In contrast, normal marrow cells did not exhibit these effects on infection with Bcr(64-413) adenovirus. We conclude from these findings that Bcr(64-413) interferes with the oncogenic effects of Bcr-Abl and therefore has the potential for use in therapy of CML.","['Wang, Y', 'Liu, J', 'Wu, Y', 'Luo, W', 'Lin, S H', 'Lin, H', 'Hawk, N', 'Sun, T', 'Guo, J Q', 'Estrov, Z', 'Talpaz, M', 'Champlin, R', 'Arlinghaus, R B']","['Wang Y', 'Liu J', 'Wu Y', 'Luo W', 'Lin SH', 'Lin H', 'Hawk N', 'Sun T', 'Guo JQ', 'Estrov Z', 'Talpaz M', 'Champlin R', 'Arlinghaus RB']","['Department of Molecular Pathology, The University of Texas M.

Epidemiological aspects].,2233-9,"GEOGRAPHIC DISTRIBUTION AND TRANSMISSION: HTLV-1 is not an ubiquitous virus. 15 to 25 million subjects are estimated to be infected. Endemic areas are recognized in southern Japan, tropical Africa, the Caribbean, some areas in Central and South America, and in few regions of the Middle East and Melanesia. In these endemic zones, 0.5 to 50% of the population, depending on age and gender, have specific antibodies against HTLV-1 antigens. Interhuman transmission can occur from mother to child by prolonged breast feeding, from men to women by sexual intercourse, and from blood exposure via infected lymphoid cells. MOLECULAR EPIDEMIOLOGY: Molecular epidemiology studies have evidenced several molecular types or genotypes of HTLV-1 linked to the geographical origin of the infected population rather than to the associated pathology (leukemia versus neuromyelopathy). The high stability of the HTLV-1 genome is probably related to clonal expansion of infected cells conjugated to the minimal use of the reverse transcriptase. This low variability has been used as a molecular tool to better understand the origin, the evolution and the dissemination of this retrovirus. The current distribution of HTLV-1, and its simian homologue STLV-1, results from at least 4 events: transmission of STLV-1 between different monkey species, transmission of STLV-1 to humans, persistence of HTLV-1 in isolated human populations, and finally global and more recent distribution of HTLV-1 (mainly the cosmopolite subtype) subsequent to migration of virus-infected populations.","['Gessain, A', 'Mahieux, R']","['Gessain A', 'Mahieux R']","[""Unite d'Oncologie virale, Departement du SIDA et des Retrovirus, Institut Pasteur, 28 rue du Dr. Roux, F 75724 Paris. agessain@pasteur.fr""]",['fre'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",France,Presse Med,"Presse medicale (Paris, France : 1983)",8302490,"['0 (Antibodies, Viral)', '0 (DNA, Viral)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Viral/blood', 'DNA, Viral/classification/*genetics', 'Endemic Diseases/prevention & control/*statistics & numerical data', 'Genotype', 'HTLV-I Infections/*epidemiology/immunology/prevention & control/transmission/*virology', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/classification/*genetics/immunology', 'Humans', 'Molecular Epidemiology', 'Monkey Diseases/transmission/virology', 'Phylogeny', 'Population Surveillance', 'Sequence Homology, Nucleic Acid', 'Seroepidemiologic Studies']",53,2001/02/24 12:00,2001/03/03 10:01,['2001/02/24 12:00'],"['2001/02/24 12:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/03 10:01 [medline]', '2001/02/24 12:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Presse Med. 2000 Dec 23;29(40):2233-9.,Un virus appele HTLV-1.

Eggs from an infected broiler breeder flock were hatched at the laboratory. The flock was reared in a floor pen, transferred to laying cages at 22 wk, and inseminated to produce fertile eggs. A cohort of 139 chickens was tested at frequent intervals over a 62-wk period for virus, viral antigens, or antibodies in plasma, cloacal swabs, egg albumen, and embryos. Virus was detected in 7% of chicks at hatch but spread rapidly so that virtually all chicks became infected between 2 and 8 wk of age. Mortality due to myeloid leukosis and related tumors was 22%. Over 40% of the chicks developed persistent infections, whereas the remainder experienced transient infections. Five types of infection profiles were recognized. Novel responses included hens that were positive for virus intermittently or started late in life to shed viral antigens into the cloaca. ALV-J was isolated from 6% of 1036 embryos evaluated between 26 and 62 wk. However, over 90% of the virus-positive embryos were produced between 29 and 34 wk of age. Of 80 hens that produced embryos, 21 produced at least one infected embryo and were identified as transmitters. All but one transmitter hen would have been detected by a combination of viremia, cloacal swab, and albumen tests conducted between 18 and 26 wk. However, virus was transmitted to embryos from hens that were not persistently viremic or that rarely shed viral group-specific antigen into the albumen of their eggs. Intermittent patterns of both antigen shedding and virus transmission to embryos were observed in some hens. These results validate current screening procedures to identify potential transmitter hens and provide some suggestions for improvement but also show that identification of all transmitter hens by such procedures is unlikely. Thus, eradication programs based solely on dam testing may be less effective than those where dam testing is combined with procedures to mitigate early horizontal transmission in progeny chicks.","['Witter, R L', 'Bacon, L D', 'Hunt, H D', 'Silva, R E', 'Fadly, A M']","['Witter RL', 'Bacon LD', 'Hunt HD', 'Silva RE', 'Fadly AM']","['USDA-Agricultural Research Service, Avian Disease and Oncology Laboratory, East Lansing, MI 48823, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Avian Dis,Avian diseases,0370617,,IM,"['Animals', 'Animals, Newborn/virology', 'Avian Leukosis/transmission/*virology', 'Avian Leukosis Virus/classification/isolation & purification/*physiology', 'Chick Embryo', '*Chickens', 'Female', 'Male', 'Ovum/virology', 'Poultry Diseases/*virology']",,2001/02/24 12:00,2001/03/10 10:01,['2001/02/24 12:00'],"['2001/02/24 12:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/10 10:01 [medline]', '2001/02/24 12:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Avian Dis. 2000 Oct-Dec;44(4):913-31.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Second, modern molecular methods have improved our ability to identify minimal residual disease (MRD) in patients who appear to be in remission. These methods will allow physicians to tailor therapy, offering, for example, more intensive therapy to patients who harbor MRD.

MATERIAL AND METHODS: In that conference it was recommended the use of the following antibodies: cytoplasmic CD79a (cCD79a) and CD19 to define B-progenitor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL); cCD3 and CD7 for T-cell ALL (T-ALL), and CD13, CD33 and myeloperoxidase (cMPO) for acute myeloblastic leukemia (AML). We analyzed the expression of these cellular antigens in 91 non-consecutive patients classified with the extended panel as: B-ALL 28 cases; T-ALL 7; B-T-ALL 2; AML 47; and mixed-lineage acute leukemia 7 cases. RESULTS: All 28 B-ALL cases were positive with each of the two recommended antibodies cCD79a and CD19, whereas in 24 AML cases (the expression of cCD79a was not assayed in 23 cases) and in 7 T-ALL patients both antigens were absent. cCD3 and CD7 antigens were identified in 71% and 100% of T-ALL, respectively. CD7 antigen was not detected in any of the 28 patients with B-ALL but it was expressed in 6 of 47 AML cases, while none of 75 B-ALL and AML cases were positive to cCD3. Forty nine percent of AML were positive for the three recommended markers: cMPO, CD13 and CD33, and 51% of AML cases reacted with one or two of these three monoclonal antibodies. Six out of 28 cases of B-ALL had aberrant expression of myeloid antigen (CD33 in 3 cases and CD13 in 3 cases). CONCLUSIONS: There was no difference in the definition of AL lineage between employing the extended antibody panel and that recommended by the Latinamerican consensus.","['Piedras, J', 'Barrales-Benitez, O', 'Lopez-Karpovitch, X']","['Piedras J', 'Barrales-Benitez O', 'Lopez-Karpovitch X']","['Departamento de Hematologia y Oncologia, Laboratorio de Biologia Celular, Instituto Nacional de Ciencias Medicas y Nutricion Salvador Zubiran. piedras@quetzal.innsz.mx']",['spa'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Mexico,Rev Invest Clin,Revista de investigacion clinica; organo del Hospital de Enfermedades de la Nutricion,9421552,,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Consensus Development Conferences as Topic', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Latin America', 'Leukemia/*classification/immunology']",,2001/02/24 12:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2001/02/24 12:00'],"['2001/02/24 12:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2001/02/24 12:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Rev Invest Clin. 2000 Sep-Oct;52(5):524-8.,Clasificacion de las leucemias agudas de acuerdo con el consenso de la primera conferencia latinoamericana en la tipificacion inmunologica de las leucemias.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although neoplastic diseases are often accompanied by alterations in lipid metabolism, chylomicrons are scarcely explored in cancer, despite their importance for the body's energy supply. Moreover, no data are available regarding chylomicron metabolism in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Chylomicron metabolism in the bloodstream consists of lipolysis by lipoprotein lipase and uptake of remnants by the liver and is difficult to assess in the human body. Among the methods to evaluate this pathway, the determination of the plasma kinetics of triglyceride-rich emulsions that mimic chylomicrons is a practical and straightforward approach. A double-labeled chylomicron-resembling emulsion was injected into 10 patients with CLL and into 11 normolipidemic healthy subjects. The plasma kinetic curves of the emulsion 3H-triglyceride and 14Ccholesteryl ester were determined in plasma samples collected over 30 min. The fractional clearance rate (FCR) of triglycerides in CLL was not changed compared with controls. The FCR of cholesteryl esters was also no different from controls. These results indicate that chylomicron lipolysis and remnant removal are not affected in CLL.","['Sakashita, A M', 'Bydlowski, S P', 'Chamone, D A', 'Maranhao, R C']","['Sakashita AM', 'Bydlowski SP', 'Chamone DA', 'Maranhao RC']","['Fundacao Pro-Sangue Hemocentro de Sao Paulo, SP, Brasil.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Germany,Ann Hematol,Annals of hematology,9107334,"['0 (Carbon Radioisotopes)', '0 (Cholesterol Esters)', '0 (Cholesterol, HDL)', '0 (Cholesterol, LDL)', '0 (Chylomicrons)', '0 (Emulsions)', '10028-17-8 (Tritium)', '122-32-7 (Triolein)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Carbon Radioisotopes', 'Cholesterol Esters/blood', 'Cholesterol, HDL/blood', 'Cholesterol, LDL/blood', 'Chylomicrons/administration & dosage/*blood', 'Emulsions/*metabolism', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Injections, Intravenous', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*blood', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Triolein/analysis', 'Tritium']",,2001/02/24 12:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2001/02/24 12:00'],"['2001/02/24 12:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2001/02/24 12:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Ann Hematol. 2000 Dec;79(12):687-90. doi: 10.1007/s002770000205.,,,['10.1007/s002770000205 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The cells were seeded on glass coverslips precoated with an electrontransparent melamine resin, which allowed their in situ labeling with monoclonal antibodies (MoAb) and subsequent analysis by whole mount immunoelectron microscopy (WM-IEM) or transmission immunoelectron microscopy (TIEM). Timed incubation of the cells in serum-free medium +/- interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma, 500 U/ml) induced a spreading of the monocytes and the blasts of four out of five leukemias, characterized by the development of numerous filopodia which led to initial cell-cell contacts. In parallel, an increase in CD 54 surface density in four out of five leukemias could be detected, while no evidence of a CD 54 redistribution (capping) on single cells could be observed. WM-IEM studies detected no CD 54 molecules in the ""early"" cell-cell contacts, while ""later"" cell-cell contacts displayed strong CD 54 positivity. These data indicate that CD 54 is not involved in initial cell-cell contacts but is shifted secondarily to the cell contact sides and may thereby stabilize the adjacent membrane areas. The absence of spreading of the CD 54 negative blasts in one out of five leukemias and the blockade of the cellular migration by an anti-CD 54 MoAb (Clone 84H10) in the remaining cases suggest that CD 54 expression is necessary for cellular locomotion. The observed inhibitory effect of the anti-CD 54 MoAb probably mimics a negative circuit that serves to control cellular migration.","['Heil, G', 'Krauter, J', 'Westphal-Frosch, C', 'Ganser, A']","['Heil G', 'Krauter J', 'Westphal-Frosch C', 'Ganser A']","['Department of Hematology/Oncology, Hannover Medical School, Germany.

To elucidate the mechanisms whether leukemic cells responding to ONO-4007, a lipid A derivative, undergo differentiation or apoptosis, we established two cell clones from a rat myelomonocytic leukemia c-WRT-7/P2 clone which undergoes differentiation followed by apoptosis by ONO-4007-treatment. One of the clones (1D6) showed the features of differentiation, such as phagocytosis when treated with ONO-4007 more than 24 hrs. The other clone (3B1) clearly showed the features of apoptosis, such as DNA ladder formation within 24 hrs after incubation with ONO-4007. We then examined expression of CD14, p21, p38MAPK, JNK/SAPK, and bcl-2, functional p53 statuses and cell cycle in these two clones, and revealed the following: Without treatment with ONO-4007; 1) CD14, p21, and bcl-2 proteins were equally expressed in both clones; 2) wild-type and non-functional mutated-type p53 were present in both clones and the p53 in 3B1 clone was recessive whereas that in 1D6 clone was dominant negative; 3) p38MAPK in 3B1 clone was already phospholyrated whereas that in 1D6 clone was not. After treatment with ONO-4007; 1) neither expressions of CD14 nor that of p21 protein was changed in any of the clones; 2) p38MAPK in 3B1 clone was dephospholyrated at 1 and 2 hrs after treatment whereas that in 1D6 clone was phospholyrated at 4 and 8 hrs after treatment; 3) the expression of bcl-2 protein in 3B1 clone was reduced.

Overexpression of BCRP caused by exposure of cells to mitoxantrone (MX) or doxorubicin/verapamil resulted in a resistance pattern that is different from what is generally seen in the case of P-glycoprotein and MRP1 overexpression. Recently, the BCRP gene has been described in ovarian, breast, colon, and gastric cancer and fibrosarcoma cell lines. Our human tumor cells T8 and MX3, derived from the ovarian cancer cell line IGROV1 by stepwise increased exposure to topotecan and MX, are resistant to topotecan, CPT11, SN38, and 9-aminocamptothecin as well as MX.

Exhibition of similar levels of antiproliferative activities of CPT 2 and 3 required different incubation time periods in cell cultures, with CPT and 3 requiring the shortest and longest periods, respectively. Both 2 and 3 were inactive against cells resistant to the semisynthetic CPT derivative 9-nitrocamptothecin and unable to stabilize DNA-topoisomerase I (Topo I) ""cleavable complexes"" in a cell-free system, suggesting that Topo I activity was required but insufficient for the mechanism of action of 2 and 3. Mouse liver homogenate converted esters to parental CPT, but the conversion rates were different with different esters. Of four tested esters in this experiment, ester 2 had the fastest conversion rate. In vivo studies showed that ester 2 had an exceptional lack of toxicity in nude mice, even at enormous doses, and demonstrated extensive activity against human breast and colon tumors grown as xenografts in immunodeficient nude mice, whereas no antitumor activity was observed for the other esters. In conclusion, ester 2 is a prodrug of the antitumor compound CPT, and it can be administered at very high doses in mice with no appearance of toxicity. This study provides a basis for further evaluation of CPT ester 2 as an investigational anticancer agent.","['Cao, Z', 'Pantazis, P', 'Mendoza, J', 'Early, J', 'Kozielski, A', 'Harris, N', 'Vardeman, D', 'Liehr, J', 'Stehlin, J S', 'Giovanella, B']","['Cao Z', 'Pantazis P', 'Mendoza J', 'Early J', 'Kozielski A', 'Harris N', 'Vardeman D', 'Liehr J', 'Stehlin JS', 'Giovanella B']","['Stehlin Foundation for Cancer Research, 1918 Chenevert Street, Houston, TX 77003, USA. zcao@pipeline.com']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Ann N Y Acad Sci,Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences,7506858,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Esters)', 'XT3Z54Z28A (Camptothecin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/chemistry/*pharmacology/toxicity', 'Breast Neoplasms/drug therapy/pathology', 'Camptothecin/*analogs & derivatives/chemistry/*pharmacology/toxicity', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Colonic Neoplasms/drug therapy/pathology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/chemistry/*pharmacology/toxicity', 'Esters/chemistry/pharmacology/toxicity', 'Female', 'HL-60 Cells/cytology/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'U937 Cells/cytology/drug effects', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",,2001/02/24 12:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2001/02/24 12:00'],"['2001/02/24 12:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2001/02/24 12:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Ann N Y Acad Sci. 2000;922:122-35. doi: 10.1111/j.1749-6632.2000.tb07031.x.,,,['10.1111/j.1749-6632.2000.tb07031.x [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A head MRI revealed multiple masses in the brain, a biopsy of which revealed a tumor of CML cells. Although 40 Gy gamma-knife therapy had reduced the size and numbers of brain tumors, we found recurrence of left hemiparesis and tumors three months after the gamma-knife therapy. Whole brain irradiation therapy (total 30 Gy) was somewhat effective to the tumor and hemiparesis transiently subsided. Thereafter her general condition worsened again, and she died in June, 1999, eight months after the diagnosis of the brain tumors of leukemic cells. We had not seen any other clinical evidence of generalized blastic crisis in this patient. In our case, MRI of the brain showed two patterns of metastases, tumor forming and cortical invasive type.

This review is focused on immunohistochemical and morphometric techniques involving nucleated erythroid precursors, resident macrophages and their various subsets, megakaryocytes and finally argyrophilic (reticulin-collagen) fibers. Regarding standardized intervals of examination in the postgraft sequential trephine biopsies a pronounced reduction in cellularity was obvious and accompanied by a decrease in the quantity of erythro- and megakaryopoiesis. A significant correlation between the number of erythroid precursors and CD68+-macrophages could be determined in the areas of regenerating hematopoiesis. This finding is in keeping with the important functional role of the centrally localized mature macrophages during erythropoiesis. A relevant pretransplant reduction of the red cell lineage and an early to advanced reticulin fibrosis were correlated with a low hemoglobin level (anemia) and splenomegaly and furthermore associated with a significant delay to reach transfusion independence. This result was supported by corresponding findings in biopsy specimens performed shortly after day 30 following BMT (standard interval for assessment of engraftment). Samples revealed an enhancement of fiber density and a conspicuous decrease in the amount of erythropoiesis in the small fraction of patients who did not conform with the usually accepted criteria for successful hematopoietic reconstitution. Considering the compartment of histiocytic reticular cells the recurrence of Pseudo-Gaucher cells (PCGs) in the engrafted donor marrow was remarkable and most prominently expressed in the first two months following BMT. This feature was presumed to be functionally linked with a pronounced degradation of cell debris in the sequel of myelo-ablative therapy (scavenger macrophages). According to planimetric measurements in the postgraft bone marrow the atypical dwarf-like CD61+-megakaryocytes characteristic for CML disappeared. On the other hand, normalization of megakaryocyte size and nuclear lobulation were absent in sequential examination of the few patients developing a leukemic relapse. In a number of patients with manifest myelofibrosis at onset, an initial regression after BMT was followed by an insidiously occurring retrieval which was concentrated on the areas of reconstituting hematopoiesis. Similar to its relevant pretransplant association the postgraft reappearance of myelofibrosis was significantly correlated with the quantity of CD61+-megakaryocytes. Altogether a number of histological features in the pre-and postgraft bone marrow exhibited significant correlations with each other and thus indicated functional relationships. Moreover, quantity of erythropoiesis and amount of reticulin fibers (myelofibrosis) exerted a significant impact on engraftment status.","['Thiele, J', 'Kvasnicka, H M', 'Beelen, D W', 'Leder, L D', 'Schaefer, U W']","['Thiele J', 'Kvasnicka HM', 'Beelen DW', 'Leder LD', 'Schaefer UW']","['Institute of Pathology, University of Cologne, Germany. j.thiele@uni-koeln.de']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",Spain,Histol Histopathol,Histology and histopathology,8609357,,IM,"['Animals', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/*pathology/*physiology', 'Hematopoiesis/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*therapy']",98,2001/02/24 12:00,2001/03/17 10:01,['2001/02/24 12:00'],"['2001/02/24 12:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/17 10:01 [medline]', '2001/02/24 12:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Histol Histopathol. 2001 Jan;16(1):213-26. doi: 10.14670/HH-16.213.,,,['10.14670/HH-16.213 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,10.14670/HH-16.213 [doi],,,,

Chronic myeloid leukemia is characterized with abnormal tyrosine kinase activity of the fused bcr/abl gene, which is most often product of translocation between chromosomes 9 an 22. It is as yet unknown whether this is the only and sufficient cause of the disease, or whether other supporting and co-active abnormalities exist. It is also not yet clear whether an increase of proliferating activity or reduced programmed cell death plays the dominant role. The aim of this study was to make further steps in resolving the question as to which of these hypotheses fits better. METHODS AND RESULTS: Membrane macroarrays (Clontech 7742-1: Human Cancer cDNA Expression Array with 588 gene probes) were used throughout the study, on which cDNA reverse-transcribed from total RNA in turn isolated from peripheral white blood cells and labelled with 32P was hybridized. Cells obtained from 5 patients with confirmed diagnoses by cytogenetic and molecular (bcr/abl) analyses, but who had not yet been treated by chemotherapy, were the source of the material. In some cases mononuclears and granulocytes were also isolated by Ficoll-Paque centrifugation. Radioactivity was detected by autoradiography or by a Phosphorimager (Fujifilm FLA-2000). Comparison with normal gene expression (healthy donor) was made by subtraction using Clontech AtlaImage 1.5 software. Although changes of expression of identical genes were not observed in all of patients examined, the majority of them were concordant. Values at least double those of the controls applied to the activity of c-jun N-terminal kinase, MMP-8, MMP-9, integrin alpha E, integrin beta and PDGF, whereas the expression of ZAP-70, IRF1, MCL-1, STAT 5B, RARA, CDC25B, RPSA, TNFR decreased. Increases of PCNA, MMP-17, CD59, rho G, CRAF1 and PIG7 or decreases of notch, caspase 8, caspase 4, interleukin 6 receptor, rho B and TIMP1 were observed only in some cell samples. CONCLUSIONS: It seems that some maturation processes and transmembrane signalling are blocked, as well as the effectors of apoptosis. On the other hand, the reduced activity of ZAP-70, IRF1 and MCL-1 also indicated that proliferation breaks were weakened. The involvement of both processes-released replication and ineffective apoptosis--was evident; the problem of bcr/abl gene fusion being the necessary first and sufficient step on the way towards developing chronic myeloid leukemia, however, remained unresolved.","['Bruchova, H', 'Klamova, H', 'Brdicka, R']","['Bruchova H', 'Klamova H', 'Brdicka R']","['Ustav hematologie a krevni transfuze, Praha.']",['cze'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Czech Republic,Cas Lek Cesk,Casopis lekaru ceskych,0004743,"['EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*genetics', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*genetics', '*Leukocytes']",,2001/02/24 12:00,2001/03/07 10:01,['2001/02/24 12:00'],"['2001/02/24 12:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/07 10:01 [medline]', '2001/02/24 12:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cas Lek Cesk. 2000 Oct 25;139(21):655-9.,Genova exprese bilych krvinek u chronicke myeloidni leukemie.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To confirm these presumptions in children we measured sHLA class I. serum levels in children after allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (BMT). We also investigated the levels of sHLA in the supernatants of mixed lymphocyte cultures (MLC) as possible predictors of GVHR prior to BMT. METHODS AND RESULTS: Group of 6 investigated children included 1 child with severe combined immunodeficiency, 3 children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia, 1 with severe combined immunodeficiency, 3 children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia, 1 with severe aplastic anemia and 1 with non Hodgkin lymphoma. The period of follow up varied from 15 days to 21 months according to the course of the disease. In the prediction of GVHR the levels of sHLA were measured in 5 children with acute leukemia in supernatants of MLC and the results were compared with the grade of GVHR classified according Seattle criteria. Soluble HLA class I. molecules were evaluated by ELISA. Rise of the levels of sHLA preceded 1-2 days the clinical signs of GVHR, however, it could not be distinguished from the occasional rise of a different cause. The levels of sHLA found in the supernatants of MLC showed individual results, which did not correspond to the level of cytokines in the same culture, or to the grade of GVHR observed. However, twice higher levels of sHLA in the culture of donor lymphocytes correlated with the lethal outcome of GVHR despite the fact that the donors were HLA identical siblings. CONCLUSIONS: The usefulness of sHLA levels as the predictors of GVHR has to be interpreted with great caution, but they can be used as a part of the mosaic composed of the clinical image and other laboratory results indicating GVHR. The predictive value of sHLA in supernatants of MLC is still to be evaluated.","['Sediva, A', 'Stary, J', 'Hromadnikova, I', 'Skalicka, A', 'Ghio, M']","['Sediva A', 'Stary J', 'Hromadnikova I', 'Skalicka A', 'Ghio M']","['Ustav imunologie 2.

Concentrations of 5-10 microM bpV(phen) caused the characteristic DNA ladder pattern, starting after 4.5 h.

Here we test whether trimidox also exhibits anti-neoplastic properties in ovarian carcinoma cells. Since the mode of action of trimidox on cell fate has not been investigated so far, we addressed this unresolved item and find that this polyhydroxybenzoic acid derivative induces apoptosis of N.1 human ovarian carcinoma cells when tested in growth factor deprived medium. Utilizing an improved analysis, based on Hoechst 33258/propidium iodide double staining, apoptosis is quantified and discriminated from necrosis. Trimidox induces c-myc expression, which is indispensible for apoptosis of N.1 cells, and expression of plasminogen activator/urokinase type (upa), which supports the apoptotic process under more physiological conditions. Surprisingly, trimidox does not block dNTP synthesis in N.1 cells at the concentrations tested and, therefore, trimidox induces apoptosis independent of RR-inhibition. Like TNFalpha or benzamide riboside, which are also inducers of apoptosis of N.1 cells, trimidox also down-regulates the G1 cell cycle phosphatase cdc25A, whereas cyclin D1 becomes up-regulated. This report shows that trimidox destroys human ovarian carcinoma cells by inducing them to undergo apoptosis as well as corroborating previous investigations which demonstrated that apoptosis of these cells depends on c-myc over-expression when survival factors are withdrawn.","['Rosenberger, G', 'Fuhrmann, G', 'Grusch, M', 'Fassl, S', 'Elford, H L', 'Smid, K', 'Peters, G J', 'Szekeres, T', 'Krupitza, G']","['Rosenberger G', 'Fuhrmann G', 'Grusch M', 'Fassl S', 'Elford HL', 'Smid K', 'Peters GJ', 'Szekeres T', 'Krupitza G']","['Institute of Clinical Pathology, University of Vienna, Austria.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Life Sci,Life sciences,0375521,"['0 (3,4,5-trihydroxybenzamidoxime)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamidines)', '0 (Deoxyribonucleotides)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '136601-57-5 (Cyclin D1)', 'EC 1.17.4.- (Ribonucleotide Reductases)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (CDC25A protein, human)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Cdc25a protein, mouse)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (cdc25 Phosphatases)', 'EC 3.4.21.73 (Urokinase-Type Plasminogen Activator)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', '*Apoptosis/genetics', 'Benzamidines/*pharmacology', 'Cyclin D1/biosynthesis', 'Deoxyribonucleotides/metabolism', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Female', 'Gene Expression/drug effects', 'Genes, cdc/drug effects', '*Genes, myc', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Ovarian Neoplasms/*drug therapy', 'Ribonucleotide Reductases/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Urokinase-Type Plasminogen Activator/biosynthesis', 'cdc25 Phosphatases/biosynthesis']",,2001/02/24 12:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2001/02/24 12:00'],"['2001/02/24 12:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2001/02/24 12:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Life Sci. 2000 Nov 17;67(26):3131-42. doi: 10.1016/s0024-3205(00)00901-2.,,,"['S0024320500009012 [pii]', '10.1016/s0024-3205(00)00901-2 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have searched for parameters that may be of value in the early diagnosis of infection, in discriminating between bacterial and non-bacterial causes and for monitoring the response to antimicrobiotic therapy. PATIENTS: 46 febrile episodes in 33 children with malignant diseases under anti-neoplastic therapy, aged 0.5 to 17 years, were included. Each patient was supplied with a central venous catheter (Hickman catheter). METHODS: Blood was taken for the evaluation of C-reactive-protein (CRP), Interleukin-6 (IL-6) and Procalcitonin (PCT). Laboratory data included WBC, blood cultures, as well as microbiologic and serologic tests for important infectious agents. Patients were grouped as follows: 1. Patients with febrile diseases and positive blood cultures, 2. Patients with localized bacterial or mycotic infections and negative blood cultures, 3. Patients with fever of unknown origin, 4. Patients with viral infections, 5. Control group. RESULTS: CRP and IL-6 were more sensitive than PCT in detecting bacterial and mycotic diseases in leukopenic children, because of low PCT-levels in patients with localized infections. IL-6 values were high shortly after onset of fever and decreased under sufficient antimicrobiotic therapy until day three. CONCLUSIONS: Because of the quick response, IL-6 may be helpful in monitoring antimicrobiotic therapy. Using Procalcitonin-levels, we were not able to distinguish between localized bacterial and viral infection in leukocytopenic patients.","['Bayer, L', 'Schontube, M', 'Dorffel, W']","['Bayer L', 'Schontube M', 'Dorffel W']","['2.

A comparative immunohistochemical study.,11-7,"To develop a practical immunohistochemistry panel for distinguishing lymphoblastic lymphoma from Ewing sarcoma (ES), we evaluated 17 ES and 27 lymphoblastic lymphoma and leukemia cases with antibodies to CD99, terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT), leukocyte common antigen (LCA), CD43, CD79a, CD20, CD3, vimentin, and neuron-specific enolase (NSE). Three cases were bone lymphomas, 2 initially misdiagnosed as ES. All cases were CD99+. All lymphomas and leukemias were TdT+ compared to none of the ESs. None of the ESs expressed other lymphocytic markers, which were inconsistently expressed in the lymphomas and leukemias: CD43, 33%; LCA, 30%; CD79a, 19%; CD3, 19%; and CD20, 7%. Of the ESs, 88% were vimentin positive compared with 23% of lymphomas and leukemias. Vimentin was stronger and more diffuse in ES. NSE did not reliably stain any cases. When faced with the differential diagnosis of ES vs lymphoblastic lymphoma, an immunohistochemical panel that includes antibodies to CD99 and TdT is useful. Both epitopes are well preserved in fixed and decalcified tissue. A panel composed of antibodies to CD99 and TdT, in conjunction with other lymphocytic markers and vimentin, is highly sensitive and specific.","['Lucas, D R', 'Bentley, G', 'Dan, M E', 'Tabaczka, P', 'Poulik, J M', 'Mott, M P']","['Lucas DR', 'Bentley G', 'Dan ME', 'Tabaczka P', 'Poulik JM', 'Mott MP']","[""Department of Pathology, Wayne State University School of Medicine, Harper, Hutzel, and Children's Hospitals, and Karmanos Cancer Institute, Detroit, MI, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",England,Am J Clin Pathol,American journal of clinical pathology,0370470,"['0 (12E7 Antigen)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (CD99 protein, human)', '0 (Cell Adhesion Molecules)', '0 (Vimentin)', 'EC 2.7.7.31 (DNA Nucleotidylexotransferase)']",IM,"['12E7 Antigen', 'Adult', 'Antigens, CD/metabolism', 'Cell Adhesion Molecules/metabolism', 'Child', 'DNA Nucleotidylexotransferase/metabolism', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Female', 'Humans', '*Immunohistochemistry', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*metabolism/*pathology', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Sarcoma, Ewing/*metabolism/*pathology', 'Vimentin/metabolism']",,2001/02/24 12:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['2001/02/24 12:00'],"['2001/02/24 12:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2001/02/24 12:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Am J Clin Pathol. 2001 Jan;115(1):11-7. doi: 10.1309/K1XJ-6CXR-BQQU-V255.,,,['10.1309/K1XJ-6CXR-BQQU-V255 [doi]'],,,,['Am J Clin Pathol. 2001 Jun;115(6):933-4.

Candidiasis and aspergillosis account for most invasive fungal infections. General prophylactic measures include strict hygiene and environmental measures. Haemopoietic growth factors shorten the duration of neutropenia and thus may reduce the incidence of fungal infections. Fluconazole is appropriate for antifungal prophylaxis and should be offered to patients with prolonged neutropenia, such as high-risk patients with leukaemia undergoing remission induction or consolidation therapy and high-risk stem cell transplant recipients. Empirical antifungal therapy is mandatory in patients with persistent febrile neutropenia who fail to respond to broad-spectrum antibacterials. Intravenous amphotericin B at a daily dose of 0.6 to 1 mg/kg is preferred whenever aspergillosis cannot be ruled out. Lipid formulations of amphotericin B have demonstrated similar efficacy and are much better tolerated. Fluconazole is the best choice for acute candidiasis in stable patients; amphotericin B should be used in patients with unstable disease. Use of fluconazole is restricted by the existence of resistant strains (Candida krusei and, to a lesser extent, C. glabrata). Amphotericin B still remains the gold standard for invasive aspergillosis. Lipid formulations of amphotericin B are effective in aspergillosis and because they are less nephrotoxic are indicated in patients with poor renal function.

In the home, however, it is necessary to investigate this from the advantages of care ability and economics. The present patient had long term difficulties in ingesting food. After a gastrostomy in December 1999, the patient returned home with the aim of improving his quality of life, as strongly desired by both the patient and his carer. Since the patient experienced symptoms of diarrhea with enteral alimentation after the gastrostomy, combination oral nutrients (terumiru mini) were diluted and injected after discharge from the hospital. However, this alimentation was not covered by medical insurance, making its cost performance high. At the start of the nursing care insurance system, the patient was certified as having a care level of 5, and the caregiver, who is the patient's eldest son (myelogenic leukemia), had great expectations. However, his burden in the form of purchasing the current alimentation and using the service was extremely difficult financially, so that he was nearly forced to give up hope. Managing the speed of the injection was also a source of great anxiety. Thus, with a view to the lifestyle of the family, an evaluation of their care ability, and analysis of methods able to meet the needs and overcome problems in care crises, as well as adopting the condition that the method be covered by medical insurance, we attempted a change in alimentation and the purchase of an enteral pump. The process of making these changes involved a nutritionist working in cooperation with the doctor, a nurse from a care facility, and a visiting nurse who took the role of coordinator with a medical supply company. The above was possible due to continuous support while confirming a satisfactory care status was being maintained. As a result, we were able to alleviate the economic and psychological burden of care. In the present process, we learned that a care crisis should always be expected, and that we must have the ability to judge the overall needs of the patient while evaluating care ability. Moreover, we discovered that the nursing ability to provide timely, continuing care, including the psychological aspect, is demanded.","['Seki, H', 'Hamada, N']","['Seki H', 'Hamada N']","['Ohiso Hospital, Tokai University School of Medicine.']",['jpn'],"['Case Reports', 'English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Japan,Gan To Kagaku Ryoho,Gan to kagaku ryoho.

This gene product promotes the polymerization of clathrin into clathrin cage and found to be a regulator in membrane trafficking between intracellular compartments in eukaryotic cells (Kim et al., 2000). In this study, we have purified the CALM protein from clathrin-coated vesicles of rat liver using the monoclonal antibody against the recombinant N-terminal region of the CALM. The coated proteins extracted from the coated vesicle fraction was further purified by multi-step procedures involving gel-filtration and ion-exchange chromatography and SDS-PAGE. The purified protein with an apparent molecular weight of 100 kD promoted the assembly of clathrin triskelia into clathrin cage. In this respect the CALM protein bears a functional resemblance to the AP180 that has been previously described.","['Kim, H L', 'Kim, J A']","['Kim HL', 'Kim JA']","['Department of Biochemistry, Medical College, Ewha Womans University, Seoul, Korea. hyung@mm.ewha.ac.kr']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Exp Mol Med,Experimental & molecular medicine,9607880,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Vesicular Transport)', '0 (Clathrin)', '0 (Monomeric Clathrin Assembly Proteins)', '0 (Nerve Tissue Proteins)', '0 (PICALM protein, human)', '0 (Phosphoproteins)', '0 (clathrin assembly protein AP180)']",IM,"['Adaptor Proteins, Vesicular Transport', 'Animals', 'Clathrin/*metabolism', 'Clathrin-Coated Vesicles/*chemistry', 'Liver/*chemistry', '*Monomeric Clathrin Assembly Proteins', 'Nerve Tissue Proteins/*isolation & purification', 'Phosphoproteins/*isolation & purification', 'Rats']",,2001/02/24 12:00,2001/03/10 10:01,['2001/02/24 12:00'],"['2001/02/24 12:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/10 10:01 [medline]', '2001/02/24 12:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Exp Mol Med. 2000 Dec 31;32(4):222-6. doi: 10.1038/emm.2000.36.,,,['10.1038/emm.2000.36 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In order to understand a possible inter-relationship between the G-CSF and GM-CSF induced leukocyte responses and expression levels of receptors for G-CSF (G-CSFr) and GM-CSF (GM-CSFr), the levels of each receptor and CSF were measured in patients with basophilia (8), eosinophilia (14) and bacterial infection showing neutrophilia (12) in comparison with normal healthy adults (12) and children (14). G-CSFr was expressed in neutrophils in the largest amount followed by monocytes, but GM-CSFr was expressed more in monocytes than neutrophils. Lymphocytes and basophils did not express G-CSFr or GM-CSFr. The amount of GM-CSFr in neutrophils was present less in patients with infection than normal control (P = 0.031). The neutrophils expressed more G-CSFr than GM-CSFr. The quantity of G-CSFr in eosinophil showed marked interval change, higher in acute stage. The plasma concentrations of G-CSF in patients with infection were much higher than normal adults or children (117.95 +/- 181.16 pg/ml, P < 0.05). Binding assay with excess amount of CSFs could discriminate the patient who did not show any response to G-CSF or GM-CSF administration. After incubation with excess CSFs, more receptors were blocked in children than in adults (G-CSF P = 0.024, GM-CSF P = 0.006). These results indicate that the amount of CSFr in leukocyte varies in different types of leukocyte, and changes according to the patients' condition even in the same type of leukocyte, and the CSFrs of children bind to CSFs more than those of adults.","['Lee, K Y', 'Suh, B G', 'Kim, J W', 'Lee, W', 'Kim, S Y', 'Kim, Y Y', 'Lee, J', 'Lim, J', 'Kim, M', 'Kang, C S', 'Han, K']","['Lee KY', 'Suh BG', 'Kim JW', 'Lee W', 'Kim SY', 'Kim YY', 'Lee J', 'Lim J', 'Kim M', 'Kang CS', 'Han K']","[""Department of Clinical Pathology, St. Mary's Hospital, Catholic University, Medical College, Seoul, Korea.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Exp Mol Med,Experimental & molecular medicine,9607880,"['0 (Colony-Stimulating Factors)', '0 (Receptors, Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '0 (Receptors, Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '0 (Receptors, Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",IM,"['Adult', '*Bacterial Infections', 'Basophils/chemistry', 'Breast Neoplasms', 'Child', 'Colony-Stimulating Factors/*blood', 'Eosinophilia', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive', '*Leukocyte Disorders', 'Monocytes/chemistry', '*Neoplasms', 'Neutrophils/chemistry', 'Receptors, Colony-Stimulating Factor/*analysis', 'Receptors, Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/analysis', 'Receptors, Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/analysis']",,2001/02/24 12:00,2001/03/10 10:01,['2001/02/24 12:00'],"['2001/02/24 12:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/10 10:01 [medline]', '2001/02/24 12:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Exp Mol Med. 2000 Dec 31;32(4):210-5. doi: 10.1038/emm.2000.34.,,,['10.1038/emm.2000.34 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To evaluate a possibility that DZA may be utilized for the treatment of human leukemia, we studied molecular events of cell death induced by DZA in human leukemia HL-60 and U-937 cells. DZA induced a specific cleavage of poly ADP-ribose polymerase (PARP) and an activation of the cysteine protease caspase-3/CPP32 which is known to cleave PARP. DZA-mediated nuclear DNA-fragmentation was completely blocked in the presence of a universal inhibitor of caspases (z-VAD-fmk) or the specific inhibitor of caspase-3 (z-DEVD-fmk) unlike of cycloheximide (CHX). DNA fragmentation was preceded by the lowering of c-myc mRNA in the DZA treated cells. In addition, DZA-induced apoptosis was blocked by pretreatment with adenosine transporter inhibitors such as nitrobenzylthioinosine (NBTI) and dipyridamole (DPD). Taken together, these results demonstrate that DZA-induced apoptosis initiated through an active transport of DZA into human leukemia cells, is dependent on the caspase-3-like activity without de novo synthesis of proteins and possibly involves c-myc down-regulation.","['Kim, H S', 'Jeong, S Y', 'Lee, J H', 'Kim, B E', 'Kim, J W', 'Jeong, S W', 'Kim, I K']","['Kim HS', 'Jeong SY', 'Lee JH', 'Kim BE', 'Kim JW', 'Jeong SW', 'Kim IK']","['Department of Biochemistry, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Exp Mol Med,Experimental & molecular medicine,9607880,"['0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '037V4520IY (3-deazaadenosine)', '46S541971T (Thioinosine)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'GV1L2DZM2Z (4-nitrobenzylthioinosine)', 'K72T3FS567 (Adenosine)', 'M351LCX45Y (Tubercidin)']",IM,"['Adenosine/metabolism', '*Apoptosis', 'Biological Transport, Active', 'Carrier Proteins/metabolism', 'Caspase 3', 'Caspases/*metabolism', 'Down-Regulation', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Genes, myc', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*drug therapy', 'Thioinosine/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Transcription Factors/genetics', 'Tubercidin/*pharmacology', 'U937 Cells']",,2001/02/24 12:00,2001/03/10 10:01,['2001/02/24 12:00'],"['2001/02/24 12:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/10 10:01 [medline]', '2001/02/24 12:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Exp Mol Med. 2000 Dec 31;32(4):197-203. doi: 10.1038/emm.2000.32.,,,['10.1038/emm.2000.32 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,
