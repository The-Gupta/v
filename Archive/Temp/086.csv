Recently, it has been shown that CD200 may improve the distinction between chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL; CD200+) and mantle cell lymphoma (MCL; CD200-), but the role of CD200 expression in atypical CLL and other MBN remains to be established. METHODS: To address this issue, we investigated the expression of CD200 in 159 consecutive cases of MBN. RESULTS: CD200 was strongly expressed in CLL and was revealed to be an excellent marker to distinguish CLL from MCL, even in cases of atypical CLL. However, lack of CD200 was not an exclusive finding of MCL, being also observed in other MBNs. Furthermore, CD200 was highly expressed in hairy cell leukemia, being useful in the differential diagnosis of lymphomas with villous lymphocytes. Herein, we propose an algorithm to classify CD5+ MBNs based on the expression of CD200, CD11c, heavy chain immunoglobulins, and Matutes score. CONCLUSIONS: These results expand the understanding of the CD200 expression in MBNs, giving further support for the inclusion of this marker in the routine investigation by flow cytometry.",['(c) 2013 Clinical Cytometry Society.'],['NOTNLM'],"['CD200', 'chronic lymphocytic leukemia', 'flow cytometry', 'lymphoma', 'mantle cell lymphoma']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

PROCEDURE: We undertook a retrospective study of three treatment eras: (1) (1988-1995) n = 68 when EBRT was used as primary conservative therapy; (2) (1995-2003) n = 46 when carboplatin-based systemic chemoreduction was introduced and (3) (2003-2009) (n = 83) when additional periocular chemotherapy was added for advanced tumors and pre-enucleation chemotherapy was given for those with massive buphthalmia. RESULTS: The probability of 5-year disease-free survival was 0.94 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.91-0.98%) without significant differences among the three eras. Chemoreduction reduced the use of EBRT from 84.6% to 68.7% in eras 1 and 3, respectively (P = 0.008), which was more evident in cases with less advanced disease. Chemoreduction also significantly improved the 5-year probability of preservation of eyes with advanced disease from 0.13 (95% CI 0.04-0.27) during era 1 to 0.49 (95% CI 0.34-0.62) in era 3 (P < 0.0001). Chemoreduction was not associated with changes in the probability of extraocular relapse, which was reduced after the introduction of pre-enucleation chemotherapy. Second malignancies occurred in nine cases, acute myeloid leukemia being the most fatal one. Trilateral retinoblastoma occurred in three cases and all of them had been exposed to chemotherapy. CONCLUSIONS: Chemoreduction reduced the need for EBRT in eyes with less advanced disease and improved the preservation of eyes with advanced disease while its effects on secondary malignancies or trilateral disease remain unclear.","['(c) 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']",['NOTNLM'],"['chemotherapy', 'developing countries', 'retinoblastoma', 'second malignancies']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

PROCEDURE: From 2001 to 2010, 108 evaluable patients </=16 years of age who were newly diagnosed with biopsy-proven LBL were treated with one of three treatment protocols: CCCG-99, SCMC-T-NHL-2002, or LBL-CHOF-2006. RESULTS: Two patients had Stage I disease, 5 had Stage II, 55 had Stage III, and 46 had Stage IV. The immunophenotype was T-cell LBL in 92 patients (85.2%) and precursor B-cell LBL in 16 (14.8%). The abandonment rate was 11.5%. Twenty-five patients (23.2%) suffered from resistant disease, including 1 with isolated central nervous system (CNS) relapse. At a median follow-up of 40.4 months (range, 0-114 months), the 5-year probability of event-free survival (pEFS) was 63.9 +/- 4.6% in all patients. The 5-year pEFS for patients with pB-LBL was better than for patients with T-LBL (100% vs. 61.3 +/- 5.1%, P = 0.007). Patients who had achieved complete remission on day 33 of induction had significantly better pEFS than those who had not (78.8 +/- 4.6% vs. 28.2 +/- 9.0%, P = 0.000). Three of 25 patients who experienced resistant disease were alive at the end of the study period. CONCLUSIONS: The abandonment rate was lower for patients with LBL than for patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Prophylactic cranial radiation can be omitted for patients with LBL even when advanced-stage disease is present, as intensive systemic chemotherapy with intrathecal therapy is sufficient to prevent CNS relapse. The survival of patients with resistant disease was very poor.","['(c) 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']",['NOTNLM'],"['childhood', 'developing country', 'lymphoblastic lymphoma', 'non-Hodgkin lymphoma']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

In spite of the widespread use of AgNPs, relatively few studies have been undertaken to determine the cytotoxic effects of AgNPs. The aim of this study was investigate how AgNPs of different sizes (4.7 and 42 nm) interact with two different tumoral human cell lines (hepatoma [HepG2] and leukemia [HL-60]). In addition, glutathione depletion, inhibition of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation were used to evaluate feasible mechanisms by which AgNPs exerted its toxicity. AgNPs of 4.7 nm and 42 nm exhibited a dramatic difference in cytotoxicity. Small AgNPs were much more cytotoxic than large AgNPs. A difference in the cellular response to AgNPs was found. HepG2 cells showed a higher sensitivity to the AgNPs than HL-60. However, the cytotoxicity induced by AgNPs was efficiently prevented by NAC treatment, which suggests that oxidative stress is primarily responsible for the cytotoxicity of AgNPs. Furthermore, cellular antioxidant status was disturbed: AgNPs exposure caused ROS production, glutathione depletion and slight, but not statistically significant inactivation of SOD.","['Copyright (c) 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.']",['NOTNLM'],"['N-acetyl-cisteine', 'cytotoxicity', 'glutathione', 'reactive oxygen species', 'silver nanoparticles', 'superoxide dismutase']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Pronounced antiproliferative effects were noted for all complexes, along with moderate inhibitory activity of thioredoxin reductase (TrxR) and efficient binding to biomolecules (DNA, albumin). Biodistribution studies showed that the presence of albumin lowered the cellular uptake and confirmed the transport of rhodium into the nuclei. Changes in the mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) were observed as well as DNA fragmentation in wild-type and daunorubicin- or vincristine-resistant Nalm-6 leukemia cells.

Emerging evidence from several short-term studies has raised concerns on the detrimental clinical outcomes and waste of resources associated with poor adherence to imatinib. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to evaluate the effects of long-term imatinib adherence on clinical treatment responses and mortality. SETTING: This retrospective cohort study was conducted in a medical centre in southern Taiwan. METHOD: Chronic myeloid leukaemia patients who were prescribed for more than 1 month of imatinib were identified and their medical charts were reviewed from the first date of imatinib prescription to the last date of medical record or upon patients' death. Patients' basic characteristics, imatinib prescriptions, results of laboratory tests, episodes of imatinib-related side effects and mortality rate were recorded. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Participants' basic characteristics, medication possession ratio and their mortality rate; the association between the medication possession ratio and treatment responses. RESULTS: Of the 119 included patients, the mean follow-up time was 3.9 +/- 2.9 patient-years and the mean medication possession ratio was 89.7 %. At the 18th month of imatinib treatment, 67.2, 54.3 and 34.5 % patients achieved complete cytogenetic, major molecular and complete molecular responses, respectively. There was a significant difference in the 4-year survival rate between the adherence (n = 87) and non-adherence (n = 32) groups (91 vs. 72 %; p = 0.0076). Logistic regression analysis revealed that imatinib adherence was the only factor that significantly influenced the 18th month complete cytogenetic response [odds ratio (OR) 11.6; 95 % confidence interval (CI) 1.7, 114.7; p = 0.0131] and major molecular response (OR 5.1; 95 % CI 1.1, 26.8; p = 0.0351).

All known NF-kappaB activators converge on the IkappaB kinase (IKK) complex to activate the canonical and non-canonical NF-kappaB pathways. The IKK complex contains two catalytic subunits (IKKalpha and IKKbeta) and a regulatory subunit NEMO/IKKgamma that regulates the canonical NF-kappaB pathway, whereas IKKalpha regulates the non-canonical pathway. The process of IKKalpha activation and its role in the regulation of canonical NF-kappaB activation remain elusive. The canonical pathway is rapidly activated and produces a potent inflammatory response to bacterial and viral infections as well as different types of stress; however, uncontrolled NF-kappaB activation can lead to autoimmune diseases and cancers. Therefore, to keep the inflammatory response in check, elaborate negative regulatory mechanisms operate to terminate NF-kappaB activation at multiple levels by de novo synthesis of NF-kappaB inhibitory proteins, and orchestration of protein ubiquitination and deubiquitination. The NF-kappaB target genes, IkappaBalpha and A20, play critical roles in termination of the active canonical NF-kappaB pathway. In this review, we discuss our recent findings describing a novel function for IKKalpha in nucleating the ubiquitin-editing enzyme A20 complex, a major negative regulator of canonical NF-kappaB signaling. Consistently with an inhibitory function of IKKalpha, it is targeted by the human T-cell leukemia virus 1 (HTLV-1) oncoprotein, Tax, to prevent assembly of the A20 complex to maintain persistent NF-kappaB activation that promotes transformation and survival of virus-transformed cells.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, several problems leading to TKI resistance still impede a complete cure of this disease. IFN regulatory factor-8 (IRF8) is a transcription factor essential for the development and functions of immune cells, including dendritic cells. Irf8(-/-) mice develop a CML-like disease and IRF8 expression is downregulated in patients with CML, suggesting that IRF8 is involved in the pathogenesis of CML. In this study, by using a murine CML model, we show that BCR-ABL strongly inhibits a generation of dendritic cells from an early stage of their differentiation in vivo, concomitant with suppression of Irf8 expression. Forced expression of IRF8 overrode BCR-ABL (both wild-type and T315I-mutated) to rescue dendritic cell development in vitro, indicating that the suppression of Irf8 causes dendritic cell deficiency. Gene expression profiling revealed that IRF8 restored the expression of a significant portion of BCR-ABL-dysregulated genes and predicted that BCR-ABL has immune-stimulatory potential. Indeed, IRF8-rescued BCR-ABL-expressing dendritic cells were capable of inducing CTLs more efficiently than control dendritic cells. Altogether, our findings suggest that IRF8 is an attractive target in next-generation therapies for CML.",['(c)2013 AACR'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In a total of 127 courses of HD-MTX in 51 patients with childhood ALL, influence of clinical and pharmacogenetic factors on plasma MTX concentration and HD-MTX-related renal dysfunction was evaluated. Clinical factors included age, gender, duration of HD-MTX continuous-infusion and duration of pre-hydration before HD-MTX. Pharmacogenetic factors included 5 gene polymorphisms within the MTX pathway genes, namely, SLC19A1, MTHFR, ABCC2 and ABCG2. Short duration of pre-hydration before HD-MTX is the most important risk factor for prolonged high MTX concentration (p < 0.001, OR 6.40, 95 % CI 2.39-17.16) and renal dysfunction (p = 0.013, OR 3.15, 95 % CI 1.27-7.80).

METHODS: 120,852 men and women aged 55-69 years at time of enrollment in 1986 were followed up (17.3 years) for incident lung, breast and brain cancer, and hemato-lymphoproliferative malignancies. Information on occupational history and potential confounders such as sex, age, smoking, alcohol use, and attained educational level were collected at baseline through a self-administered questionnaire. Occupational ELF-MF exposure was assigned with a job-exposure matrix. Using a case-cohort approach, associations with cancer incidence were analyzed with Cox regression stratified by sex, using three exposure metrics: (1) ever had a job with low or high exposure to ELF-MF versus background, (2) duration of exposure, and (3) cumulative exposure. RESULTS: None of the exposure metrics showed an effect on incidence for lung, breast, and brain cancer, nor any of the assessed subtypes in men and women. Of the hemato-lymphoproliferative malignancies in men, ever high exposed to ELF-MF showed a significant association with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) [hazard ratio (HR) 2.15; 95 % confidence interval (CI) 1.06-4.35] and follicular lymphoma (FL) (HR 2.78; 95 % CI 1.00-5.77). Cumulative exposure to ELF-MF showed a significant, positive association with FL but not AML among men. CONCLUSIONS: In this large prospective cohort study, we found some indications of an increased risk of AML and FL among men with occupational ELF-MF exposure. These findings warrant further investigation.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We hypothesized that initial disease control by effective cytoreduction, followed by rapid induction of a profound allo-immune response by donor-lymphocyte infusion during the neutropenic phase, is essential for long-term survival. Additional interferon-alpha was administered when no acute graft-versus-host-disease occurred within 3 weeks after donor-lymphocyte infusion. Overall, 44 patients with relapsed acute myeloid leukemia were assessed; 26 had relapsed after myeloablative conditioning and 18 after reduced-intensity conditioning. Of these 44 patients, seven were not eligible for cytoreductive treatment because of poor performance status (n=3) or severe graft-versus-host-disease (n=4) at the time of relapse. Patients with smoldering relapses (n=5) received donor-lymphocyte infusion only. Thirty-two patients received cytoreductive treatment, followed by donor-lymphocyte infusion in 22 patients. Reasons for not receiving donor-lymphocyte infusion were chemotherapy-related death (n=1) and chemotherapy-refractory disease (n=9). The 2-year overall survival rate after donor-lymphocyte infusion was 36% (95% confidence-interval: 16-57%). The impact of acute graft-versus-host-disease on survival was calculated with a Cox-regression model including onset of acute graft-versus-host-disease as a time-dependent variable. Development of grade 1-3, but not grade 4, acute graft-versus-host-disease was associated with superior survival as compared to absence of graft-versus-host-disease (hazard ratio 0.22, P=0.03). In conclusion, efficient cytoreduction followed by donor-lymphocyte infusion and subsequent interferon-alpha leading to limited acute graft-versus-host-disease represents a potentially curative option for patients with relapsed acute myeloid leukemia after allogeneic transplantation.",,,,PMC3971086,,,,,,,,,,,,

Within this cohort of patients with relapsed ETV6/RUNX1-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia, the largest analyzed for genome wide DNA copy number alterations to date, alterations were present in every ETV6/RUNX1-positive relapse and a high proportion of them occurred in recurrent overlapping chromosomal regions. Recurrent losses affected chromosomal regions 12p13, 6q21, 15q15.1, 9p21, 3p21, 5q and 3p14.2, whereas gains occurred in regions 21q22 and 12p.

Patients were asked to complete a questionnaire including questions on symptom severity and health status. The symptoms assessed were: abdominal discomfort, diarrhea, edema, fatigue, headache, muscle cramps, musculoskeletal pain, nausea and skin problems. The physicians were asked to complete a questionnaire for each of their patients entering the study. Four hundred twenty-two patients were included in the study. All respective paired physicians (n=29) completed the questionnaire, and thus the analyses are based on 422 patient-physician dyads. Agreement on symptom ratings ranged from 34% (for muscle cramps) to 66% (for nausea). For all symptoms, patients reported higher severity more often than their physicians. The three symptoms whose severity was most frequently underestimated by physicians were fatigue (51%), muscle cramps (49%) and musculoskeletal pain (42%). Health status was overestimated by physicians in 67% of the cases. Physicians and their patients with chronic myeloid leukemia often disagree in their ratings of the patients' symptom severity. Most typically, physicians tend to underestimate symptom severity and overestimate the overall health status of their patients. Current findings support the use of patient-reported outcome measures as a possible means to enhance the management of patients with chronic myeloid leukemia.",,,,PMC3971090,,,,,,,,,,,,

Since allogeneic hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) has been introduced as a modality with curative potential during study period, we also evaluated the association of the annual number of allo-HSCT and the trend of the mortality of ATLL. Endemic (Kyushu) and non-endemic areas (others) were evaluated separately. Significance in the trend of mortality was evaluated by joinpoint regression analysis. During the study period, a total of 14 932 patients died of ATLL in Japan, and mortality decreased significantly in both areas (annual percent change (95% confidence interval (CI)): Kyushu, -3.1% (-4.3, -1.9); others, -3.4% (-5.3, -1.5)). This decreasing trend in mortality seems to be associated with an increase in the number of allo-HSCTs (Kyushu, R-squared=0.70, P=0.003; and others, R-squared=0.55, P=0.058).

METHODS: Human T-ALL cells line Molt-4 was examined. The cell viability was measured using MTT assay. Apoptotic cells were studied with Hoechst 33258 staining. Cell apoptosis and cell cycle were analyzed using flow cytometry with Annexin V/PI staining and PI staining, respectively. The levels of multiple proteins, including Akt, p65, CDK4/6, p18, Bcl-2 family proteins, MDM2, and p53, were examined with Western blotting. The level of MDM2 mRNA was determined using RT-PCR. RESULTS: Treatment of Molt-4 cells with BIIB021 (50-800 nmol/L) inhibited the cell growth in a dose-dependent manner (the IC50 value was 384.6 and 301.8 nmol/L, respectively, at 48 and 72 h). BIIB021 dose-dependently induced G0/G1 phase arrest, followed by apoptosis of Molt-4 cells. Furthermore, BIIB021 increased the expression of p18, decreased the expression of CDK4/6, and activated the caspase pathway in Molt-4 cells. Moreover, BIIB021 (50-400 nmol/L) dose-dependently decreased the phospho-MDM2 and total MDM2 protein levels, but slightly increased the phospho-p53 and total p53 protein levels, whereas TPL (5-40 nmol/L) dose-dependently enhanced p53 activation without affecting MDM2 levels. Co-treatment with BIIB021 and TPL showed synergic inhibition on Molt-4 cell growth. The co-treatment disrupted p53-MDM2 balance, thus markedly enhanced p53 activation. In addition, the co-treatment increased the expression of Bak and Bim, followed by increased activation of caspase-9. CONCLUSION: The combination of BIIB021 and TPL may provide a novel strategy for treating T-ALL by overcoming multiple mechanisms of apoptosis resistance.",,,,PMC4002565,,,,,,,,,,,,

One of the key regulators of this process is ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) kinase, which modulates the p53 level by direct and indirect phosphorylation. Recent data showed that ATM also localizes at the centrosome, but the function remains elusive. TAX1BP2 was initially identified as a novel centrosomal protein that interacts directly with the human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1)-encoded oncoprotein, Tax, and inhibits centrosome overduplication. Subsequently, TAX1BP2 was found to be a tumor suppressor in hepatocellular carcinoma, and accumulation of TAX1BP2 was observed upon chemotherapeutic drug treatment. Here, we provide evidence that TAX1BP2 is a direct phosphorylation substrate of ATM. The protein level of TAX1BP2 is significantly upregulated in response to DNA damaging agents. Serine-922 of TAX1BP2 is the phosphorylation site of ATM, and such phosphorylation modulates the protein stability, ubiquitination and tumor suppressor activity of TAX1BP2. Taken together, we demonstrate for the first time that TAX1BP2 is a novel effector of ATM in DNA damage response and delineated a new mechanism by which ATM stabilizes the tumor suppressor TAX1BP2.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Aberrant subcellular localisation of PRH is associated with breast cancer and thyroid cancer. Further, in blast crisis chronic myeloid leukaemia, and a subset of acute myeloid leukaemias, PRH is aberrantly localised and its activity is downregulated. Here we show that PRH is involved in the regulation of cell migration and cancer cell invasion. We show for the first time that PRH is expressed in prostate cells and that a decrease in PRH protein levels increases the migration of normal prostate epithelial cells. We show that a decrease in PRH protein levels also increases the migration of normal breast epithelial cells. Conversely, PRH overexpression inhibits cell migration and cell invasion by PC3 and DU145 prostate cancer cells and MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells. Previous work has shown that the transforming growth factor-beta co-receptor Endoglin inhibits the migration of prostate and breast cancer cells. Here we show that PRH can bind to the Endoglin promoter in immortalised prostate and breast cells. PRH overexpression in these cells results in increased Endoglin protein expression, whereas PRH knockdown results in decreased Endoglin protein expression. Moreover, we demonstrate that Endoglin overexpression abrogates the increased migration shown by PRH knockdown cells. Our data suggest that PRH controls the migration of multiple epithelial cell lineages in part at least through the direct transcriptional regulation of Endoglin. We discuss these results in terms of the functions of PRH in normal cells and the mislocalisation of PRH seen in multiple cancer cell types.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2013 Nov 16.,,"BACKGROUND: Fatigue is the most common and disabling symptom affecting quality of life (QOL) and daily function in patients who have completed treatment for acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Although trials in patients with various solid tumors have reported improved fatigue and QOL following exercise interventions, there have been no studies in AML patients post treatment. METHODS: Forty patients aged >/= 40 years who had completed treatment for AML were enrolled in a 12-week randomized phase II exercise intervention to determine feasibility (recruitment, retention, and adherence), efficacy, and safety of the intervention. Patients assigned to the exercise group received an individualized, moderate-intensity, 12-week home-based exercise program with weekly telephone support from a certified exercise physiologist. QOL, fatigue, and fitness outcomes were measured at baseline, 6 weeks, and 12 weeks. Between-group differences in 12-week change scores were calculated using linear regression adjusting for age and baseline function. RESULTS: Recruitment and retention rates were 38% and 91%, respectively. Adherence was low at 28%. Analyses did not suggest statistically significant or clinically important benefits in QOL, fatigue, or physical fitness with the intervention. The level of adherence did not appear to impact outcomes. There were no adverse events. CONCLUSION: A home-based exercise program for post-treatment AML patients age 40 years or older can be safely delivered with reasonable recruitment and high retention. However, feasibility was hampered by low adherence. Further research and program modification are needed to better understand and overcome barriers to exercise delivery and adherence in AML survivors.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, there are no other studies on this topic available in Hungary. AIM: The aim of the authors was to analyze the incidence of malignant haematological disorders between 1983 and 2012 using data obtained from the leukaemia/lymphoma registry of the Szabolcs-Szatmar-Bereg county. METHOD: Between January 1, 1983 and December 31, 2012, 3964 adult patients with newly diagnosed haematological malignancy were recorded in the registry. Patients with myelodysplastic syndrome or monoclonal gammopathy were not registered. RESULTS: The annual number of newly diagnosed patients indicated an increasing tendency of malignant haematological disorders. The increase was primarily due to the increasing number of patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, chronic lymphocytic leukaemia, and essential thrombocythaemia. CONCLUSIONS: These observations are in line with data reported in the international literature. The incidence rate of haematological malignancies in this region of Hungary was similar to data published in populations from Western European countries and the United States.",,['NOTNLM'],"['Hodgkin-kor', ""Hodgkin's disease"", 'Szabolcs-Szatmar-Bereg county', 'Szabolcs-Szatmar-Bereg megye', 'acute lymphoid laeukemia', 'acute myeloid leukaemia', 'akut lymphoid leukaemia', 'akut myeloid leukaemia', 'chronic lymphoid leukaemia', 'chronic myeloid leukaemia', 'essential thrombocythaemia', 'essentialis thrombocythaemia', 'haematological malignancies', 'incidence rate', 'incidencia', 'kronikus lymphoid leukaemia', 'kronikus myeloid leukaemia', 'malignus hematologiai korkepek', 'multiple myeloma', 'myelofibrosis', 'myeloma multiplex', 'nem-Hodgkin-lymphoma', ""non-Hodgkin's lymphoma"", 'polycythaemia vera']",,,,,,Malignus hematologiai betegsegek gyakorisaga 1983-2012 kozott Szabolcs-Szatmar-Bereg megye felnott lakossaga koreben. 30 ev adatainak elemzese.,,,,,,,

It is responsible for the initiation of leukemia but also indispensable for disease maintenance and propagation, although its function in these latter processes is less clear. We therefore investigated the effects of the perceived p53 pathway alterations in model cell lines and primary leukemias and, in particular, how E/R upregulates MDM2, the predominant negative regulator of p53. We found that E/R transactivates MDM2 in both p53(+/+) and p53(-/-) HCT116 cells by binding to promoter-inherent RUNX1 motifs, which indicates that this activation occurs in a direct and p53-independent manner. Treatment of E/R-positive leukemic cell lines with Nutlin-3, a small molecule that inhibits the MDM2/p53 interaction, arrests their cell cycle and induces apoptosis. These phenomena concur with a p53-induced expression of p21, pro-apoptotic BAX and PUMA, as well as caspase 3 activation and poly ADP-ribose polymerase cleavage. The addition of DNA-damaging and p53-activating chemotherapeutic drugs intensifies apoptosis. Moreover, Nutlin-3 exposure leads to an analogous p53 accumulation and apoptotic surge in E/R-positive primary leukemic cells. Our findings clarify the role of p53 signaling in E/R-positive leukemias and outline the potential basis for its therapeutic exploitation in this setting.",,,,PMC3948158,,,['P 22073/Austrian Science Fund FWF/Austria'],,,,,,,,,

Our limited understanding of MLL-AF4-mediated transformation reflects the absence of human models reproducing this leukemia. Hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPCs) constitute likely targets for transformation. We previously reported that MLL-AF4 enhanced hematopoietic engraftment and clonogenic potential in cord blood (CB)-derived CD34+ HSPCs but was not sufficient for leukemogenesis, suggesting that additional oncogenic lesions are required for MLL-AF4-mediated transformation. MLL-AF4+ pro-B-ALL display enormous levels of FLT3, and occasionally FLT3-activating mutations, thus representing a candidate cooperating event in MLL-AF4+ pro-B-ALL. We have explored whether FLT3.TKD (tyrosine kinase domain) mutation or increased expression of FLT3.WT (wild type) cooperates with MLL-AF4 to immortalize/transform CB-CD34+ HSPCs. In vivo, FLT3.TKD/FLT3.WT alone, or in combination with MLL-AF4, enhances hematopoietic repopulating function of CB-CD34+ HSPCs without impairing migration or hematopoietic differentiation. None of the animals transplanted with MLL-AF4+FLT3.TKD/WT-CD34+ HSPCs showed any sign of disease after 16 weeks. In vitro, enforced expression of FLT3.TKD/FLT3.WT conveys a transient overexpansion of MLL-AF4-expressing CD34+ HSPCs associated to higher proportion of cycling cells coupled to lower apoptotic levels, but does not augment clonogenic potential nor confer stable replating. Together, FLT3 activation does not suffice to immortalize/transform MLL-AF4-expressing CB-CD34+ HSPCs, suggesting the need of alternative (epi)-genetic cooperating oncogenic lesions.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, high-throughput kinomic and proteomic approaches enabled to identify aberrant activity profiles in mixed lineage leukemia (MLL)-rearranged acute myeloid leukemia (AML) that defined druggable targets. This approach revealed impaired activity of proteins belonging to the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway. Pharmacological druggable MAPK pathway targets tested in primary MLL-rearranged AML included MAPKK1/2 (MEK), cyclic AMP-responsive element-binding protein (CREB) and MAPK8/9 (JNK). MEK inhibition showed to severely decrease MLL-rearranged AML cell survival without showing cytotoxicity in normal controls, whereas inhibition of CREB and JNK failed to exhibit MLL selectivity. Exploring the working mechanism of MEK inhibition, we assessed proteome activity in response to MEK inhibition in THP-1. MAPK1/3 (Erk) phosphorylation was instantly decreased in concurrence with a sustained Akt/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) phosphorylation that enabled a subpopulation of cells to survive MEK inhibition. After exhaustion of MEK inhibition the AML cells recovered via increased activity of vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2 (VEGFR-2) and Erk proteins to resume their proliferative state.

Although HOPS is a transmembrane ubiquitin, an isoform with intermediate molecular weight is cleaved from the membrane and released into the cytosol, to act as the shuttling protein. We identified a signal peptide peptidase structure in N-terminal membrane-bound HOPS that allows the regulated intramembrane proteolysis (RIP) system to control the relative amounts of the released, shuttling isoform capable of binding NPM.

In particular, it targets histone H3 lysine 4 (H3K4), whose methylations serve as a gene activation mark. Recently, KMT2D has emerged as one of the most frequently mutated genes in a variety of cancers and in other human diseases, including lymphoma, medulloblastoma, gastric cancer, and Kabuki syndrome. Mutations in KMT2D identified thus far point to its loss-of-function in pathogenesis and suggest its role as a tumor suppressor in various tissues. To determine the effect of a KMT2D deficiency on neoplastic cells, we used homologous recombination- and nuclease-mediated gene editing approaches to generate a panel of isogenic colorectal and medulloblastoma cancer cell lines that differ with respect to their endogenous KMT2D status. We found that a KMT2D deficiency resulted in attenuated cancer cell proliferation and defective cell migration. Analysis of histone H3 modifications revealed that KMT2D was essential for maintaining the level of global H3K4 monomethylation and that its enzymatic SET domain was directly responsible for this function. Furthermore, we found that a majority of KMT2D binding sites are located in regions of potential enhancer elements. Together, these findings revealed the role of KMT2D in regulating enhancer elements in human cells and shed light on the tumorigenic role of its deficiency. Our study supports that KMT2D has distinct roles in neoplastic cells, as opposed to normal cells, and that inhibiting KMT2D may be a viable strategy for cancer therapeutics.",,,,PMC3875776,,,['T32 GM007184/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,

In this study, we examined selective expansion of NK cell subsets expressing distinct killer immunoglobulin-like receptors (KIRs) within the whole human peripheral blood NK cell population, in the presence of HLA-Cw3 (C1) or Cw4 (C2) transfected K562 stimulator cells. Coculture of KIR(+) NK cells with C1 or C2 positive K562 cells, in the presence of IL-2+IL-15, triggered the outgrowth of NK cells that missed their cognate ligand. This resulted in an increased frequency of alloreactive KIR(+) NK cells within the whole NK cell population. Also, after preculture with K562 cells lacking their cognate ligand, we observed that this alloreactive NK population revealed higher numbers of CD107(+) cells when cocultured with the relevant K562 HLA-C transfected target cells, as compared to coculture with untransfected K562 cells. This enhanced reactivity was confirmed using primary leukemic cells as target. This study demonstrates that HLA class I expression can mediate the skewing of the NK cell repertoire and enrich the population for cells with enhanced alloreactivity towards leukemic target cells.

Here, we sought for clues about the ontogeny of G-CLL versus MD-CLL by profiling the relevant IG gene repertoires. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Using purpose-built bioinformatics methods, we performed detailed immunogenetic profiling of a multinational CLL cohort comprising 1,256 cases, of which 1,087 and 169 expressed IG mu/delta and gamma heavy chains, respectively. RESULTS: G-CLL has a highly skewed IG gene repertoire that is distinct from MD-CLL, especially in terms of (i) overuse of the IGHV4-34 and IGHV4-39 genes and (ii) differential somatic hypermutation (SHM) load. Repertoire differences were also found when comparing subgroups with similar SHM status and were mainly attributed to the exclusive representation in G-CLL of two major subsets with quasi-identical (stereotyped) B-cell receptors. These subsets, namely #4 (IGHV4-34/IGKV2-30) and #8 (IGHV4-39/IGKV1(D)-39), were found to display sharply contrasting SHM and clinical behavior. CONCLUSIONS: G-CLL exhibits an overall distinct immunogenetic signature from MD-CLL, prompting speculations about distinct ontogenetic derivation and/or immune triggering. The reasons underlying the differential regulation of SHM among G-CLL cases remain to be elucidated.",['(c)2013 AACR.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In addition to its expression in the nervous system, Reelin is present in erythroid cells but its function there is unknown. We report in this study that Reelin is up-regulated during erythroid differentiation of human erythroleukemic K562 cells and is expressed in the erythroid progenitors of murine bone marrow. Reelin deficiency promotes erythroid differentiation of K562 cells and augments erythroid production in murine bone marrow. In accordance with these findings, Reelin deficiency attenuates AKT phosphorylation of the Ter119(+)CD71(+) erythroid progenitors and alters the cell number and frequency of the progenitors at different erythroid differentiation stages. A regulatory role of Reelin in erythroid differentiation is thus defined.","['Copyright (c) 2013 Federation of European Biochemical Societies. Published by', 'Elsevier B.V.

Past studies suggested that static magnetic field-singly applied or used combined with other physical or chemical substances-significantly relieved some pains and ameliorated certain diseases in different organ systems, e.g. hypertension, osteoporosis, neuralgia, diabetes and leukemia etc. But on the other hand, some harmful events have also been observed in a number of investigations, from cellular level to fetal development. So exposure to static magnetic field might have dual effects on experimental rodent in various environments, viz. there are potentially therapeutic benefits, as well as adverse effects from it. The positive effect may relate to moderate intensities, while negative influence seems to be in connection with acute strong static magnetic fields. In addition, different orientations of static magnetic field exert different degrees of impact. Thus, the bioeffects of static magnetic field exposure on mice/rats depend on magnetic field intensities, durations and directions, though the exactly relationship between them is still vague. Further researches need to perform with appropriate methodologies, ingenious designs repeatedly and systemically, not only in animal models, but also in human volunteers and patients.",['Copyright (c) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

The penta- and tetra-cyclic pyrrolo-1,2-diazine were evaluated for their in vitro anticancer activity against an NCI 60 human tumour cell line panel. The pentacyclic-1,2-diazine exhibit a significant anticancer activity against Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer NCI-H460, Leukemia MOLT-4, Leukemia CCRF-CEM and Breast Cancer MCF7.

These two measures of divergence are compared with the existing literatures and validated by ground truth images. Finally, it is found that hedge operator based divergence measure using Yager's entropy achieves better segmentation accuracy i.e., 98.29% for normal and 98.15% for chronic myelogenous leukocytes. Furthermore, Jaccard index has been performed to compare the segmented image with ground truth ones where it is found that that the proposed scheme leads to higher Jaccard index (0.39 for normal, 0.24 for chronic myelogenous leukemia).",['Copyright (c) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

They are less likely to be referred urgently to hospital and often present as emergencies. We examined patient perspectives of time to help-seeking and diagnosis, as well as associated symptoms and experiences. METHODS: The UK's Haematological Malignancy Research Network (http://www.hmrn.org) routinely collects data on all patients newly diagnosed with myeloma, lymphoma and leukaemia (>2000 annually; population 3.6 million). With clinical agreement, patients are also invited to participate in an on-going survey about the circumstances leading to their diagnosis (presence/absence of symptoms; type of symptom(s) and date(s) of onset; date medical advice first sought (help-seeking); summary of important experiences in the time before diagnosis). From 2004-2011, 8858 patients were approached and 5038 agreed they could be contacted for research purposes; 3329 requested and returned a completed questionnaire. The duration of the total interval (symptom onset to diagnosis), patient interval (symptom onset to help-seeking) and diagnostic interval (help-seeking to diagnosis) was examined by patient characteristics and diagnosis. Type and frequency of symptoms were examined collectively, by diagnosis and compared to UK Referral Guidelines. RESULTS: Around one-third of patients were asymptomatic at diagnosis. In those with symptoms, the median patient interval tended to be shorter than the diagnostic interval across most diseases. Intervals varied markedly by diagnosis: acute myeloid leukaemia being 41 days (Interquartile range (IQR) 17-85), diffuse large B-cell lymphoma 98 days (IQR 53-192) and myeloma 163 days (IQR 84-306). Many symptoms corresponded to those cited in UK Referral Guidelines, but some were rarely reported (e.g. pain on drinking alcohol). By contrast others, absent from the guidance, were more frequent (e.g. stomach and bowel problems). Symptoms such as tiredness and pain were common across all diseases, although some specificity was evident by sub-type, such as lymphadenopathy in lymphoma and bleeding and bruising in acute leukaemia. CONCLUSIONS: Pathways to diagnosis are varied and can be unacceptably prolonged, particularly for myeloma and some lymphomas. More evidence is needed, along with interventions to reduce time-to-diagnosis, such as public education campaigns and GP decision-making aids, as well as refinement of existing Referral Guidelines.",,,,PMC4176985,,,,,,,,,,,,

This view has led to the targeting of OX40 as a strategy to boost antigen specific T cells in the context of vaccination. In addition, the ligation of OX40 has also been shown to inhibit infection by CCR5-utilizing (R5) but not CXCR4-utilizing (X4) human immunodeficiency virus type-1 (HIV-1) via enhancement of production of CCR5-binding beta-chemokines. It was reasoned that human T cell leukemia virus type-I (HTLV-1) immortalized T cell lines that express high levels of OX40L could serve as an unique source of physiologically functional OX40L. The fact that HTLV-1+ T cell lines simultaneously also express high levels of OX40 suggested a potential limitation. RESULTS: Results of our studies showed that HTLV-1+ T cell lines bound exogenous OX40 but not OX40L, indicating that HTLV-1+ T cell lines express an active form of OX40L but an inactive form of OX40. Anti-OX40 non-blocking monoclonal antibody (mAb), but not blocking mAb, stained HTLV-1+ T cell lines, suggesting that the OX40 might be saturated with endogenous OX40L. Functionality of the OX40L was confirmed by the fact that a paraformaldehyde (PFA)-fixed HTLV-1+ T cell lines inhibited the infection of autologous activated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) with R5 HIV-1 which was reversed by either anti-OX40L blocking mAb or a mixture of neutralizing mAbs against CCR5-binding beta-chemokines. CONCLUSIONS: Altogether, these results demonstrated that autologous T cell lines immortalized by HTLV-1 can be utilized as a conventional source of physiologically functional OX40L.",,,,PMC4225675,,,,,,,,,,,,

Only a few systematic studies have been published on the topic of pancytopenia, although extensive studies have been done for its different etiological factors like aplastic anemia, megaloblastic anemia, leukemia, etc. Thus, this study was carried out to investigate for and to identify the causes of pancytopenia, to find out the frequency of different causes, to determine the incidence of pancytopenia in relation to sex and age and to compare our findings with those of other similar studies from this part of the world. METHODS: This was a prospective study conducted in the Department of Pathology of a teaching institute and a tertiary care hospital in southern Maharashtra, India, over a period of two years. All the patients referred to the central clinical laboratory for routine complete blood count (CBC) and peripheral smear (PS) examination, from both - the outpatient and the inpatient departments, were screened for pancytopenia. Of these, a total number of 250 cases that fulfilled the diagnostic criteria were selected.Detailed hematological investigations followed by bone marrow aspiration wherever indicated and possible were performed according to standard methods to ascertain the causes of pancytopenia. RESULTS: A definite male preponderance was observed, the male to female ratio being 2.6 : 1. The majority of cases were encountered in 3rd and 4th decades. Hypersplenism (29.2%), Infections (25.6%), Myelosuppressants (16.8%) and Megaloblastosis (13.2%) were the four most common causes in this large series on pancytopenia from a single centre in India. CONCLUSION: Detailed clinical history and meticulous physical examination along with baseline hematological investigations, provides invaluable information in the complete workup of pancytopenic patients, helping in systematic planning of further investigations to diagnose and ascertain the cause, avoiding a battery of unnecessary tests.",,,,PMC4177001,,,,,,,,,,,,

To our knowledge this is the first report describing delirium in two patients aged less than 60 years and enrolled in an intensive chemotherapeutic protocol for acute promyelocytic leukemia. CASE PRESENTATION: Two female Caucasian acute promyelocytic leukemia patients aged 46 and 56 years developed delirium during their induction treatment with all-trans retinoic acid and idarubicin. In both cases symptoms were initially attributed to all-trans retinoic acid that was therefore immediately suspended. In these two patients several situations may have contribute to the delirium: in patient 1 a previous psychiatric disorder, concomitant treatments with steroids and benzodiazepines, a severe infection and central nervous system bleeding while in patient 2 steroid treatment and isolation. In patient 1 delirium was treated with short-term low-doses of haloperidol while in patient 2 non-pharmacologic interventions had a beneficial role. When the diagnosis of delirium was clear, induction treatment was resumed and both patients completed their therapeutic program without any relapse of the psychiatric symptoms. Both patients are alive and in complete remission as far as their leukemia is concerned. CONCLUSIONS: We suggest that patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia eligible to intensive chemotherapy should be carefully evaluated by a multisciplinary team including psychiatrists in order to early recognize symptoms of delirium and avoid inadequate treatments. In case of delirium, both pharmacologic and non-pharmacologic interventions may be considered.",,,,PMC3832231,,,,,,,,,,,,

The reduced folate carrier gene (RFC) encodes reduced folate carrier, a protein that transports into the cell both folate and methotrexate, a commonly used chemotherapeutic drug, has been proved polymorphic at position 80 (G-->A). The role of this polymorphism in childhood ALL and its interaction with other enzymes of the folate metabolic pathway, including MTHFR, has been examined in different populations with diverse results. METHODS: In the present case-control study, 35 children with ALL and 48 healthy adult blood donors, all originating from the island of Crete (Greece), were screened for the presence of the RFC G80A polymorphism, using PCR/RFLP techniques. The effect on ALL risk and methotrexate-induced toxicities, along with the role of gene-gene interactions in our population, were examined. RESULTS: No significant association was observed between the RFC G80A genotypes and either the development of ALL or the presence of adverse events. However, a significant association was detected between the MTHFR A1298C/ RFC G80A genotype and a nonpredisposition for ALL (P = 0.035). CONCLUSION: This study suggests that gene-gene interactions in childhood ALL may be of prognostic value in our population.",['(c) 2013 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.'],['NOTNLM'],"['ALL', 'MTHFR', 'PCR', 'RFC', 'RFLP', 'SNPs']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

NKs recovered from AML patients at diagnosis are often found to be reduced in peripheral blood titers and cytolytic activity. Here, we had the unique opportunity to compare blood titers and cytolytic function of NKs from an AML patient with those of a healthy monozygotic twin. The sibling's NKs were compared with the patient's drawn either at diagnosis or in remission after chemotherapy. The cytolytic activities of NKs from these different sources for the patient's autologous AML blasts and other leukemic target cells in conjunction with triplebody SPM-2, targeting the surface antigens CD33 and CD123 on the AML cells, were compared. METHODS: Patient NKs drawn at diagnosis were compared to NKs drawn in remission after chemotherapy and a sibling's NKs, all prepared from PBMCs by immunomagnetic beads (MACS). Redirected lysis (RDL) assays using SPM-2 and antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) assays using the therapeutic antibody RituximabTM were performed with the enriched NKs. In addition, MACS-sorted NKs were analyzed for NK cell activating receptors (NCRs) by flow cytometry, and the release of TNF-alpha and IFN-gamma from blood samples of both siblings after the addition of the triplebody were measured in ELISA-assays. RESULTS: Patient NKs isolated from peripheral blood drawn in remission produced comparable lysis as NKs from the healthy twin against the patient's autologous bone marrow (BM) blasts, mediated by SPM-2. The NCR receptor expression profiles on NKs from patient and twin were similar, but NK cell titers in peripheral blood were lower for samples drawn at diagnosis than in remission. CONCLUSIONS: Peripheral blood NK titers and ex vivo cytolytic activities mediated by triplebody SPM-2 were comparable for cells drawn from an AML patient in remission and a healthy twin. If these results can be generalized, then NKs from AML patients in remission are sufficient in numbers and cytolytic activity to make triplebodies promising new agents for the treatment of AML.",,,,PMC3842817,,,,,,,,,,,,

These processes are driven by chemokines and their receptors, and depend on changes in cell migration and integrin-mediated adhesion. Here we describe how Rho and Rap guanosine triphosphatases (GTPases) contribute to both BCR signaling and chemokine receptor signaling, particularly by regulating cytoskeletal dynamics and integrin activity.

B.capitatus strains have also been reported as the cause of hospital-acquired infections and outbreaks. In this report, three fungemia cases caused by B.capitatus with hematologic malignancies have been presented. The first case was a 20-year-old female with acute lymphoblastic leukemia, the second was a 26-year-old female with B-cell malignant lymphoma and the third was a 7-year-old male with B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia. All of the patients have been receiving chemotherapy, and treated with antibacterial and antifungal agents due to neutropenia. The blood cultures obtained from the second and third patients yielded B.capitatus although they were under empirical caspofungin therapy. Those patients have been treated with voriconazole and amphotericin B after the identification of B.capitatus, and clinical improvement were noted during their follow-up. However the first patient who was also under caspofungin therapy had died just before the isolation of B.capitatus from her blood culture. Conventional mycological methods [macroscopic and microscopic morphology, germ tube test, urea hydrolysis, carbohydrate assimilation tests (API 20C AUX; BioMerieux, France), growth temperature, cycloheximide sensitivity] were used for the identification of the isolates. The strains were identified as B.capitatus with the characteristics of annelloconidia formation, urease negativity, carbohydrate utilization, growth at 45 degrees C and resistance to cycloheximide. Antifungal susceptibilities of isolates were determined by using microdilution method (for amphotericin B, fluconazole, itraconazole, voriconazole, ketoconazole) and E-test (for caspofungin). Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values of the three B.capitatus strains were detected as 0.25, 0.125, 0.032 microg/ml for amphotericin B; 2, 2, 16 microg/ml for fluconazole; 0.064, 0.032, 0.032 microg/ml for itraconazole and 0.125, 0.064, 0.064 microg/ml for ketoconazole, respectively, while MIC values of all strains were 0.032 microg/ml for voriconazole and > 32 microg/ml for caspofungin. Since B.capitatus strains were isolated from the cases within about 15 days -sequentially-, the genotypes of the isolates were determined by repetitive sequence-based PCR (DiversiLab System; BioMerieux, France) to investigate the similarity rates. The results of analysis indicated 97% similarity between two (case 1 and 2) strains and 94.9% similarity in one strain (case 3) of B.capitatus, however the transmission route could not be clarified due to the absence of environmental sampling. In conclusion, B.capitatus should also be considered as a cause of systemic fungal infections in immunocompromised patients. Determination of the in vitro antifungal susceptibilities of clinical B.capitatus strains may contribute to the therapeutic approaches and epidemiological data.",,,,,,,,,Blastoschizomyces capitatus'un Neden Oldugu Uc Fungemi Olgusu.,,,,,,,

Epub 2013 Nov 18.,,"BACKGROUND: Recommended treatment for lymphoblastic lymphomas, a highly aggressive, relatively rare lymphoma entity predominantly seen in teenagers and young adults, includes acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL)-like induction chemotherapy. Whether these patients should be consolidated with maintenance chemotherapy or autologous stem cell transplantation (Auto-SCT) and the use of radiotherapy are matters of debate. METHODS: We reviewed treatment and outcome for 25 consecutive patients above the age of 15 years with lymphoblastic lymphoma (T-lineage; T-LBL, n = 19; B-lineage; B-LBL, n = 6) seen at a single center during a 12-year period (1999-2011). Patients were given an ALL-like chemotherapy induction regimen, and responding patients were consolidated with Auto-SCT and local radiotherapy when applicable. RESULTS: Median age at diagnosis was 33 years (range 15-65). Seventeen of the T-LBL patients had a mediastinal mass, three patients had central nervous system (CNS) involvement. Chemotherapy with intensified CNS prophylaxis induced an overall response rate of 92% (CR 84%, PR 8%). In total 23/25 (92%) patients underwent Auto-SCT in first remission while 13 of 14 eligible patients with mediastinal involvement received local radiotherapy. Twenty percent of the patients had hepatotoxicity grade 3-4 and 32% thromboembolic events (TE). Two patients (8%) died of treatment-related toxicity. One patient had progressive disease and died of lymphoma. Three patients have relapsed, but two of these (both B-LBL) are currently alive in second CR after Allo-SCT. With a median follow-up of 98 months (range 1-163) the 5- and 8-year PFS and OS are 76% and 84%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Combined intensive ALL-like induction and early consolidation chemotherapy followed by Auto-SCT and local radiation therapy resulted in high sustained cure rates.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We studied the effects of monochloramine (NH2Cl) on erythroleukemic K562 cell differentiation, and compared the effects observed with those of U0126 and staurosporine, which are known inducers of erythroid and megakaryocytic differentiation, respectively. CD235 (glycophorin) expression, a marker of erythroid differentiation, was significantly increased by NH2Cl and U0126, along with an increase in cd235 mRNA levels. Other erythroid markers such as gamma-globin and CD71 (transferrin receptor) were also increased by NH2Cl and U0126. In contrast, CD61 (integrin beta3) and CD42b (GP1balpha) expression, markers of megakaryocytic differentiation, was increased by staurosporine, but did not change significantly by NH2Cl and U0126. NH2Cl retarded cell proliferation without a marked loss of viability. When ERK phosphorylation (T202/Y204) and CD235 expression were compared using various chemicals, a strong negative correlation was observed (r = -0.76). Paradoxically, NH2Cl and staurosporine, but not U0126, induced large cells with multiple or lobulated nuclei, which was characteristic to megakaryocytes. NH2Cl increased the mRNA levels of gata1 and scl, decreased that of gata2, and did not change those of pu.1 and klf1. The changes observed in mRNA expression were different from those of U0126 or staurosporine. These results suggest that NH2Cl induces the bidirectional differentiation of K562. Oxidative stress may be effective in inducing leukemic cell differentiation.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This process is called ""the Warburg effect"" and offers an attractive pharmacological target to preferentially eliminate malignant cells. In addition, recent results show that metabolic changes can be linked to tumor immune evasion. Mouse models demonstrate the importance of this metabolic remodeling in leukemogenesis. Some leukemias, although treatable, remain incurable and resistance to chemotherapy produces an elevated percentage of relapse in most leukemia cases. Several groups have targeted the specific metabolism of leukemia cells in preclinical and clinical studies to improve the prognosis of these patients, i.e. using L-asparaginase to treat pediatric acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL). Additional metabolic drugs that are currently being used to treat other diseases or tumors could also be exploited for leukemia, based on preclinical studies.

The morphology of the implants and chemical composition of the implant surface were studied by means of scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). In vitro cytotoxicity assay showed that GOS-loaded nanofibrous implants, both non-coated and QCh-coated displayed about two-fold higher inhibitory activity against Graffi tumor cells than that of free GOS at the 72nd h of incubation. As evidenced by the performed fluorescence microscopy analyses and SEM observations, the anti-tumor activity of the fibrous implants was mainly due to induction of apoptosis. The experiments in which the implants containing both QCh and GOS were placed locally into the tumor site after the tumor extirpation showed an increase in the survival rate and a lower rate of recurrence in the operative field and of metastases in regional lymph nodes.

Here, attempts were made to identify the genomic segment(s) in this region that is/are essential to correct splicing. First, vectors with a serially truncated HindIII-BglII fragment were constructed. The vector, in which a 38 bp fragment (1612-1649 bp) is deleted or reversed in proA8m1, only produced splice variants. It was found that a 38 nt region within gag contains important elements that positively regulate splicing at the correct splice sites. Further analyses of a series of vectors carrying the 38 bp fragment and its flanking sequences showed that a region (1183-1611 nt) upstream of the 38 nt fragment also contains sequences that positively or negatively influence splicing at the correct splice sites. The SphI-NdeI (5140-5400 bp) fragment just upstream of the 3'ss was deleted from vectors that carried the 38 bp fragment and its flanking sequences, which yielded correctly spliced mRNA; interestingly, these deleted vectors showed cryptic splicing. These findings suggest that the 5140-5400 nt region located just upstream of the 3'ss is required for the splicing function of the 38 nt fragment and its flanking sequences.",['(c) 2013 The Societies and Wiley Publishing Asia Pty Ltd.'],['NOTNLM'],"['env-mRNA', 'gag gene', 'murine leukemia virus', 'splicing']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Thus, we investigated the anti-tumour effects of a pan-BCL2 inhibitor, AT-101, which has high binding specificity for BCL2 and MCL1 in preclinical models of plasma cell cancers (Multiple myeloma and Waldenstrom macroglobulinaemia). Gene expression and immunoblot analysis of six plasma cell cancer models showed upregulation of BCL2 family members. AT-101 was able to downregulate BCL2 and MCL1 in all plasma cell cancer models and induced apoptotic cell death in a caspase-dependent manner by altering mitochondrial membrane permeability. This cytotoxic effect and BCL2 downregulation were further potentiated when AT-101 was combined with lenalidomide/dexamethasone (LDA).

MATERIALS & METHODS: We developed a data set of 4749 stem cell CTs up to 2013 in worldwide registries. We defined 1058 novel CTs (i.e., trials that were not observational in nature; did not involve an established stem cell therapy for an established indication, such as hematopoietic stem cells for leukemia; and did not investigate supportive measures). Based on trial descriptions, we manually coded these for eight additional elements. RESULTS: Our analysis details the characteristics of novel stem cell CTs (e.g., stem cell types being tested, disease being targeted, and whether interventions were autologous or allogeneic), geotemporal trends, and private sector involvement as sponsor or collaborator.

The genetic aberrations required for osteoblastoma development are not known and no genetic difference between conventional and aggressive osteoblastoma has been reported. In order to identify recurrent genomic aberrations of importance for tumor development we applied cytogenetic and/or SNP array analyses on nine conventional and two aggressive osteoblastomas. The conventional osteoblastomas showed few or no acquired genetic aberrations while the aggressive tumors displayed heavily rearranged genomes. In one of the aggressive osteoblastomas, three neighboring regions in chromosome band 22q12 were homozygously deleted. Hemizygous deletions of these regions were found in two additional cases, one aggressive and one conventional. In total, 10 genes were recurrently and homozygously lost in osteoblastoma. Four of them are functionally involved in regulating osteogenesis and/or tumorigenesis. MN1 and NF2 have previously been implicated in the development of leukemia and solid tumors, and ZNRF3 and KREMEN1 are inhibitors of the Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway. In line with deletions of the latter two genes, high beta-catenin protein expression has previously been reported in osteoblastoma and aberrations affecting the Wnt/beta-catenin pathway have been found in other bone lesions, including osteoma and osteosarcoma.",,,,PMC3827481,,,,,,,,,,,,

The PpIX contents were measured with a Microplate Reader at the wavelength of 412 nm and were compared in different tissues of the 2 groups. Although no significant difference in serum, bile, and excreta was found between the 2 groups, PpIX content in the shell gland and eggshell of the darker group was higher than in those of the lighter group, suggesting that PpIX was synthesized in the shell gland. We further determined the expression levels of 8 genes encoding enzymes involved in the heme synthesis and transport in the liver and shell gland at 6 h postoviposition by quantitative PCR. The results showed that expression of aminolevulinic acid synthase-1 (ALAS1) was higher in the liver of hens laying darker brown shelled eggs, whereas in the shell gland the expression levels of ALAS1, coproporphyrinogen oxidase (CPOX), ATP-binding cassette family members ABCB7 and ABCG2, and receptor for feline leukemia virus, subgroup C (FLVCR) were significantly higher in the hens laying darker brown shelled eggs. Our results demonstrated that hens laying darker brown shelled eggs could deposit more PpIX onto the eggshell and the brownness of the eggshell was dependent on the total quantity of PpIX in the eggshell.

The molecular mechanisms that account for conversion of mono- to dimethyl H3K4 (H3K4me1,2) are not well understood. In this investigation, we report that the suppressor of variegation, enhancer of zeste, trithorax (SET) domains from human MLL1 and Drosophila Trithorax undergo robust intramolecular automethylation reactions at an evolutionarily conserved cysteine residue in the active site, which is inhibited by unmodified histone H3. The location of the automethylation in the SET-I subdomain indicates that the MLL1 SET domain possesses significantly more conformational plasticity in solution than suggested by its crystal structure. We also report that MLL1 methylates Ash2L in the absence of histone H3, but only when assembled within a complex with WDR5 and RbBP5, suggesting a restraint for the architectural arrangement of subunits within the complex. Using MLL1 and Ash2L automethylation reactions as probes for histone binding, we observed that both automethylation reactions are significantly inhibited by stoichiometric amounts of unmethylated histone H3, but not by histones previously mono-, di-, or trimethylated at H3K4. These results suggest that the H3K4me1 intermediate does not significantly bind to the MLL1 SET domain during the dimethylation reaction. Consistent with this hypothesis, we demonstrate that the MLL1 core complex assembled with a catalytically inactive SET domain variant preferentially catalyzes H3K4 dimethylation using the H3K4me1 substrate. Taken together, these results are consistent with a ""two-active site"" model for multiple H3K4 methylation by the MLL1 core complex.",,['NOTNLM'],"['Automethylation', 'Chromatin Histone Modification', 'Enzyme Mechanisms', 'Epigenetics', 'Histone Methylation', 'Leukemia', 'Self-methylation']",PMC3887211,,,"['R01 CA140522/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01CA140522/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,

As infection-associated TRM occurs during all treatment phases, including the maintenance period, increased surveillance and supportive care is required throughout therapy. Improvement in outcome will require better understanding of the causes of treatment failure and TRM, incorporation of new therapies targeting the unique biological properties of DS-ALL, and enhanced supportive care measures to reduce the risk of infection-related TRM.

On follow-up investigations the aetiology of anaemia turned out to be pure red cell aplasia (PRCA) on trephine bone biopsy with an elevated serum erythropoietin level. The patient received blood transfusion support. He showed remarkable improvement on oral corticosteroids (prednisolone 60 mg/daily dose) with no further requirement of blood transfusion over next 3 months. However, when the dose of steroid was tapered down to 10 mg/day, the anaemia reappeared. An increase in the dose of steroid brought the haemoglobin level back to normal. Anaemia in CLL can be due to many reasons, of which PRCA is an uncommon association occurring in only around 1% of patients with CLL and usually refractory to the conventional treatment with steroids. This PRCA secondary to CLL is considered to be immune in origin and a response to combination of immunosuppressive therapy such as steroids, cyclosporine, rituximab is anticipated.

Epub 2013 Nov 14.,,"OBJECTIVES: To compare the frequency of headache and the procedure time following lumbar puncture (LP) using a 25-gauge needle compared to a 22-gauge needle. DESIGN: 4-period crossover blinded randomised controlled trial. SETTING: Oncology unit, Royal Children's Hospital, Melbourne. PATIENTS: Children aged 4-15 years at enrolment having LPs as part of their treatment for leukaemia. INTERVENTIONS: Each child was allocated a random sequence of four LPs, two with a 22-gauge and two with a 25-gauge needle. OUTCOME MEASURES: The presence of post-LP headache. Secondary outcomes included the presence of any headache, procedure time and impact of headache on the family. RESULTS: Data on 341 procedures in 93 randomised children were analysed. There was little difference in the incidence of post-LP headache between the two needle sizes (22-gauge 7.2%, 95% CI 3.8 to 12.2; 25-gauge 4.6%, 95% CI 2.0 to 8.9, p=0.3) or in the incidence of any headache (22-gauge 18% 95% CI 12.5 to 24.6; 25-gauge 15%, 95% CI 10.0 to 21.1, p=0.4). Use of the 25-gauge needle was associated with longer procedure times. The incidence of post-LP headache showed little evidence of an age effect (OR =1.1, 95% CI 0.98 to 1.3) and was higher in girls than in boys (11% vs 3%, respectively, OR=3.3, 95% CI 1.3 to 8.4, p=0.014). Fifty-five per cent of families with a child with a post-LP headache assessed the overall functional impact as moderate or severe. CONCLUSIONS: There was little difference in the occurrence of post-LP headache or any headache between procedures carried out using the 22-gauge or 25-gauge needles. Depending on the circumstances of the procedure and the experience of the operator, either gauge may be appropriate for an LP in a child.",,['NOTNLM'],"['Accident & Emergency', 'Clinical Procedures', 'General Paediatrics', 'Haematology', 'Oncology']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

This cytotoxicity was reliant upon DC modulation by sunitinib because the direct exposure of CIK cells to sunitinib had no significant effect. Sunitinib promoted Th1-inducing and pro-inflammatory phenotypes (IL-12, IFN-gamma and IL-6) in DCs at the expense of Th2 inducing phenotype (IL-13) and regulatory phenotype (PD-L1, IDO).

Alongside the traditional pathology H-score based on physical slides, the pathology world is welcoming digital pathology and advanced quantitative image analysis, which have enabled tissue- and cellular-level analysis. An automated workflow was implemented that includes automated staining, slide-scanning, and image analysis methodologies to explore biomarkers involved in 2 cancer targets: Aurora A and NEDD8-activating enzyme (NAE). The 2 workflows highlight the evolution of our immunohistochemistry laboratory and the different needs and requirements of each biological assay. Skin biopsies obtained from MLN8237 (Aurora A inhibitor) phase 1 clinical trials were evaluated for mitotic and apoptotic index, while mitotic index and defects in chromosome alignment and spindles were assessed in tumor biopsies to demonstrate Aurora A inhibition. Additionally, in both preclinical xenograft models and an acute myeloid leukemia phase 1 trial of the NAE inhibitor MLN4924, development of a novel image algorithm enabled measurement of downstream pathway modulation upon NAE inhibition. In the highlighted studies, developing a biomarker strategy based on automated image analysis solutions enabled project teams to confirm target and pathway inhibition and understand downstream outcomes of target inhibition with increased throughput and quantitative accuracy.

VCR is particularly important for the treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), a disease that accounts for approximately one-third of all childhood cancer diagnoses. VCR's full therapeutic potential has been limited by dose-limiting neurotoxicity, classically resulting in autonomic and peripheral sensory-motor neuropathy. In the last decade, however, the discovery that liposomal encapsulation of chemotherapeutics can modulate the pharmacokinetic characteristics of a compound has stimulated much interest in liposomal VCR (vincristine sulfate liposomal injection [VSLI]) formulations for the treatment of ALL and other hematological malignancies.

Epub 2013 Nov 14.,,"BACKGROUND: A 15-country study of nuclear workers reported significantly increased radiation-related risks of all cancers excluding leukaemia, with Canadian data a major factor behind the pooled results. We analysed mortality (1956-1994) in the updated Canadian cohort and provided revised risk estimates. METHODS: Employment records were searched to verify and revise exposure data and to restore missing socioeconomic status. Excess relative risks per sievert (ERR/Sv) of recorded radiation dose and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated using Poisson regression. RESULTS: A significant heterogeneity of the dose-response for solid cancer was identified (P=0.02), with 3088 early (1956-1964) Atomic Energy of Canada Limited (AECL) workers having a significant increase (ERR/Sv=7.87, 95% CI: 1.88, 19.5), and no evidence of radiation risk for 42,228 workers employed by three nuclear power plant companies and post-1964 AECL (ERR/Sv=-1.20, 95% CI: <-1.47, 2.39). Radiation risks of leukaemia were negative in early AECL workers and non-significantly increased in other workers. In analyses with separate terms for tritium and gamma doses, there was no evidence of increased risk from tritium exposure. All workers had mortality lower than the general population. CONCLUSION: Significantly increased risks for early AECL workers are most likely due to incomplete transfer of AECL dose records to the National Dose Registry. Analyses of the remainder of the Canadian nuclear workers (93.2%) provided no evidence of increased risk, but the risk estimate was compatible with estimates that form the basis of radiation protection standards. Study findings suggest that the revised Canadian cohort, with the exclusion of early AECL workers, would likely have an important effect on the 15-country pooled risk estimate of radiation-related risks of all cancer excluding leukaemia by substantially reducing the size of the point estimate and its significance.",,,,PMC3887280,,,"['K07 CA132918/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA132918/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,['Br J Cancer. 2014 Jan 7;110(1):1-3.

A high incidence of DNA double-strand breaks is characteristic of damage by ionizing radiation compared with those induced by other environmental mutagens. In China, residents living in areas with high level background radiation(6mSv/y) had a significantly higher frequency of dicentric and ring chromosomes compared to that for the residents living in the control areas(2mSv/y). Radiation-associated increases in risk were seen for most sites. Gender-averaged excess absolute risk rates estimated at age 70, after exposure at age 30, differ in the sites, and the risks of gastric cancer, breast cancer, colon cancer, and lung cancer were highly increased, in that order.

Suppression of anoikis resistance by novel molecular therapies would greatly benefit treatment strategies for metastatic cancers. Recently, digitoxin and several of its novel synthetic derivatives, such as alpha-l-rhamnose monosaccharide derivative (D6-MA), have been synthesized and studied for their profound anticancer activity in various cancer cell lines. In this study, we investigated the anoikis sensitizing effect of D6-MA compared with digitoxin to identify their anti-metastatic mechanism of action. D6-MA sensitized NSCLC H460 cells to detachment-induced apoptosis with significantly greater cytotoxicity (IC50=11.9 nM) than digitoxin (IC50=90.7 nM) by activating caspase-9. Screening of the Bcl-2 protein family revealed that degradation of anti-apoptotic Mcl-1 protein is a favorable target. Mcl-1 over-expression and knockdown studies in D6-MA and digitoxin exposed cells resulted in rescue and enhancement, respectively, indicating a facilitative role for decreased Mcl-1 expression in NSCLC anoikis. Transfection with mutant Mcl-1S159 attenuated detachment-induced cell death and correlated with a remaining of Mcl-1 level. Furthermore, D6-MA suppressed Mcl-1 expression via ubiquitin proteasomal degradation that is dependent on activation of glycogen synthase kinase (GSK)-3beta signaling. In addition, D6-MA also targeted Mcl-1 degradation causing an increased anoikis in A549 lung cancer cells. Anoikis sensitizing effect on normal small airway epithelial cells was not observed indicating the specificity of D6-MA and digitoxin for NSCLC.

METHODS: We examined associations of PIK3CA oncogene mutation with relapse, survival, and treatment efficacy in 627 stage III colon carcinoma case subjects within a randomized adjuvant chemotherapy trial (5-fluorouracil and leucovorin [FU/LV] vs irinotecan [CPT11], fluorouracil and leucovorin [IFL]; Cancer and Leukemia Group B 89803 [Alliance]). We detected PIK3CA mutation in exons 9 and 20 by polymerase chain reaction and pyrosequencing. Cox proportional hazards model was used to assess prognostic and predictive role of PIK3CA mutation, adjusting for clinical features and status of routine standard molecular pathology features, including KRAS and BRAF mutations and microsatellite instability (mismatch repair deficiency). All statistical tests were two-sided. RESULTS: Compared with PIK3CA wild-type cases, overall status of PIK3CA mutation positivity or the presence of PIK3CA mutation in either exon 9 or 20 alone was not statistically significantly associated with recurrence-free, disease-free, or overall survival (log-rank P > .70; P > .40 in multivariable regression models). There was no statistically significant interaction between PIK3CA and KRAS (or BRAF) mutation status in survival analysis (P(interaction) > .18).

To meet this challenge we developed a novel, simplified, fast and easy strategy for on-line toxicity registration for patients treated according to the Nordic/Baltic acute lymphoblastic leukaemia protocol, NOPHO ALL 2008, for children and young adults, including three randomisations. We used a risk-assessment based approach, avoiding reporting of expected adverse events and instead concentrating on 20 well-known serious, but rarer events with focus on changes in therapy introduced in the treatment protocol. This toxicity registration strategy was approved by the relevant regulatory authorities in all seven countries involved, as compliant within the EU directive of 2004. The centre compliance to registration was excellent with 98.9% of all patients being registered within 5weeks from the requested quarterly registration. Currently, four toxicities (thrombosis, fungal infections, pancreatitis and allergic reactions) have been chosen for further detailed exploration due to the cumulative fraction of patients with positive registrations exceeding 5%. This toxicity registration offers real-time toxicity profiles of the total study cohort and provides early warnings of specific toxicities that require further investigation.",['Copyright (c) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

DATA SOURCES: We searched PubMed database with the keywords ""chronic lymphocytic leukemia"", ""signal pathway"", or ""miRNA"" for relevant articles in recent years. STUDY SELECTION: Research articles and reviews about signaling pathways and miRNAs in CLL were chosen for review. RESULTS: Dysregulation of signaling pathways, such as B cell receptor , toll-like receptor, PI3K, nuclear factor kappaB, notch signaling pathway, Wnt/Fzd signaling pathway, and Hedgehog and Janus kinases/signal transducers and activators of transcription signaling pathway, as the terminal events of the aberrant gene expression and the pro-survival effects of microenvironment, plays a crucial role in the process of CLL. miRNAs, a novel found noncoding RNA, which regulate gene expression at transcription or post-transcription level and correlate with pathogenesis of CLL provide us new avenues to better evaluating prognosis and therapy of it. CONCLUSION: Further investigation of the dysregulation of signaling pathways and miRNAs and their relationship may provide us a new prospective to understand the pathogenesis of CLL and may provide us new strategies to resolve the clinical nodi in treatment of CLL.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, we investigated the antiproliferative effect of hispolon on human hepatocellular carcinoma NB4 cells using the MTT assay, DNA fragmentation, DAPI (4, 6-diamidino-2-phenylindole dihydrochloride) staining, and flow cytometric analysis. Hispolon inhibited the cellular growth of NB4 cells in a dose-dependent manner through the induction of cell cycle arrest at G0/G1 phase measured using flow cytometric analysis and apoptotic cell death, as demonstrated by DNA laddering. Exposure of NB4 cells to hispolon-induced apoptosis-related protein expressions, such as the cleavage form of caspase 3, caspase 8, caspase 9, poly (ADP ribose) polymerase, and the proapoptotic Bax protein. Western blot analysis showed that the protein levels of extrinsic apoptotic proteins (Fas and FasL), intrinsic related proteins (cytochrome c), and the ratio of Bax/Bcl-2 were increased in NB4 cells after hispolon treatment. Hispolon-induced G0/G1-phase arrest was associated with a marked decrease in the protein expression of p53, cyclins D1, and cyclins E, and cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) 2, and 4, with concomitant induction of p21waf1/Cip1 and p27Kip1. We conclude that hispolon induces both of extrinsic and intrinsic apoptotic pathways in NB4 human leukemia cells in vitro.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Similarities and differences in the biology of these malignancies prompted us to evaluate their metabolomics in stages requiring chemotherapy. Fingerprinting of serum metabolites by the use of LC-MS has never been applied in studies on MM and CLL patients. Obtained results revealed metabolites common for both malignancies (e.g. fatty acids, acylcarnitines, sphingolipids, phospholipids, phenylalanylphenylalanine and isoprene) as well as those which render them different (e.g. lysophosphatidylcholines, monoacylglycerols, aminocaproic acid, phenylacetylglutamine).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In HIV-1, the nucleocapsid (NC) domain is involved in gRNA packaging and displays robust nucleic acid (NA) binding and chaperone functions. In comparison, NC of human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1), a deltaretrovirus, displays weaker NA binding and chaperone activity. Mutation of conserved charged residues in the deltaretrovirus bovine leukemia virus (BLV) matrix (MA) and NC domains affects virus replication and gRNA packaging efficiency. Based on these observations, we hypothesized that the MA domain may generally contribute to NA binding and genome encapsidation in deltaretroviruses. Here, we examined the interaction between HTLV-2 and HIV-1 MA proteins and various NAs in vitro. HTLV-2 MA displays higher NA binding affinity and better chaperone activity than HIV-1 MA. HTLV-2 MA also binds NAs with higher affinity than HTLV-2 NC and displays more robust chaperone function. Mutation of two basic residues in HTLV-2 MA alpha-helix II, previously implicated in BLV gRNA packaging, reduces NA binding affinity. HTLV-2 MA binds with high affinity and specificity to RNA derived from the putative packaging signal of HTLV-2 relative to nonspecific NA. Furthermore, an HIV-1 MA triple mutant designed to mimic the basic character of HTLV-2 MA alpha-helix II dramatically improves binding affinity and chaperone activity of HIV-1 MA in vitro and restores RNA packaging to a DeltaNC HIV-1 variant in cell-based assays. Taken together, these results are consistent with a role for deltaretrovirus MA proteins in viral RNA packaging.",,,,PMC3911680,,,"['GM098500/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'ImNIH/Intramural NIH HHS/United States', 'GM065056/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'HHSN261200800001C/RC/CCR NIH HHS/United States', 'HHSN261200800001E/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 GM065056/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 GM098500/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,

This has made FLT3-activating mutations an attractive drug target because they are probable driver mutations of this disease. As more potent FLT3 inhibitors are developed, a predictable development of resistance-conferring point mutations, commonly at residue D835, has been observed. Crenolanib is a highly selective and potent FLT3 tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) with activity against the internal tandem duplication (FLT3/ITD) mutants and the FLT3/D835 point mutants. We tested crenolanib against a panel of D835 mutant cell lines and primary patient blasts and observed superior cytotoxic effects when compared with other available FLT3 TKIs such as quizartinib and sorafenib. Another potential advantage of crenolanib is its reduced inhibition of c-Kit compared with quizartinib. In progenitor cell assays, crenolanib was less disruptive of erythroid colony growth, which may result in relatively less myelosuppression than quizartinib. Finally, correlative data from an ongoing clinical trial demonstrate that acute myeloid leukemia patients can achieve sufficient levels of crenolanib to inhibit both FLT3/ITD and resistance-conferring FLT3/D835 mutants in vivo.

We have shown previously that the extent of internalization correlates with the capacity of type I mAb to simultaneously engage both CD20 and the inhibitory Fcgamma receptor, FcgammaRIIb, in a bipolar configuration. Here, we investigated whether mAbs directed at other B-cell surface receptors also engaged FcgammaRIIb and whether this interaction promoted internalization. Most mAbs engaged and activated FcgammaRIIb, with the strength of activation related to the level of mAb bound to the cell surface. However, engagement did not affect internalization of most mAb-ligated receptors, either in cell lines or primary chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells with the exception of CD19 and CD38. Furthermore, at high cell concentrations/density both cis and trans interactions between cell-surface bound mAb and FcgammaRIIb were evident, but trans interactions did not inhibit type I anti-CD20 mAb-mediated internalization. These data identify that FcgammaRIIb is engaged by many mAbs in both cis and trans configurations, triggering its activation, but that internalization via FcgammaRIIb occurs for only a select subset.

Under certain conditions, LSECs can switch from a tolerogenic to an immunogenic state and promote the development of T cell immunity. However, little is known about the mechanisms of LSECs to induce T cell immunity. In this study, we investigated whether functional maturation of LSECs can be achieved by TLR ligand stimulation and elucidated the mechanisms involved in LSEC-induced T cell immunity. We demonstrate that pretreatment of LSECs with palmitoyl-3-cysteine-serine-lysine-4 (P3C; TLR1/2 ligand) but not poly(I:C) (TLR3 ligand) or LPS (TLR4 ligand) reverted their suppressive properties to induce T cell immunity. Importantly, P3C stimulation caused functional maturation of Ag-presenting LSECs and enabled them to activate virus-specific CD8(+) T cells. The LSEC-mediated CD8(+) T cell immunity was initiated by soluble mediators, one of which was IL-12 secreted at a low but sustained level after P3C stimulation. P3C stimulation did not induce programmed death ligand 1 expression on LSECs, thereby favoring T cell proliferation and activation instead of suppression. Our data suggest that LSECs undergo maturation exclusively in response to TLR1/2 ligand stimulation and that the immunological status of LSECs was dependent upon the balance between programmed death ligand 1 and IL-12 expression. These results have implications for our understanding of liver-specific tolerance and autoimmunity and for the development of strategies to overcome T cell tolerance in situations such as chronic viral liver infections or liver cancer.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

There is evidence that RNA can transfer between cells in a multitude of ways, including in complex with proteins or lipids or in vesicles, including apoptotic bodies and exosomes. However, there remains little understanding of the function of nucleic acid transfer between human cells. In this article, we report that human macrophages transfer microRNAs (miRNAs) to hepato-carcinoma cells (HCCs) in a manner that required intercellular contact and involved gap junctions. Two specific miRNAs transferred efficiently between these cells--miR-142 and miR-223--and both were endogenously expressed in macrophages and not in HCCs. Transfer of these miRNAs influenced posttranscriptional regulation of proteins in HCCs, including decreased expression of reporter proteins and endogenously expressed stathmin-1 and insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor. Importantly, transfer of miRNAs from macrophages functionally inhibited proliferation of these cancerous cells. Thus, these data led us to propose that intercellular transfer of miRNA from immune cells could serve as a new defense against unwanted cell proliferation or tumor growth.",,,,PMC3858238,,,"['G0500563/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom', 'G0900850/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom', 'G1001044/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom', 'BB_/Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council/United Kingdom']",['EMS55181'],,,,,,['NLM: EMS55181'],,

RESULTS: We observed that CD335 was highly specific for NK cells in nonneoplastic tissues. Moreover, 61 (90%) of 68 of NK cell neoplasms demonstrated CD335 expression, whereas B-cell, myelomonocytic, and plasma cell neoplasms lacked expression.

Patients with p73 methylation had lower p21 than those in the unmethylated group (P < .001). Moreover, there was a significantly positive correlation between p73 and p21 expression in MDS (r = 0.436, P < .001). In vitro assays further confirm the role of p73 methylation in p21 expression. Compared with patients with normal expression levels of p21, patients with lower p21 expression levels experienced much higher rates of transformation to acute myeloid leukemia and lower overall survival both in univariate as well as multivariate analyses.

In response to a 2011 United States Food & Drug Administration requirement of TNF blocker manufacturers, we evaluated reporting rates of all malignancies in patients =30 years old who received the TNF blocker etanercept. METHODS: All malignancies in etanercept-exposed patients aged =30 years from the Amgen clinical trial database (CTD) and postmarketing global safety database (PMD) were reviewed. PMD reporting rates were generated using exposure information based on commercial sources. Age-specific incidence rates of malignancy for the general US population were generated from the Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) database v7.0.9. RESULTS: There were 2 malignancies in the CTD: 1 each in etanercept and placebo/comparator arms (both in patients 18-30 years old). Postmarketing etanercept exposure was 231,404 patient-years (62,379 patient-years in patients 0-17 years; 168,485 patient-years in patients 18-30 years). Reporting rates of malignancy per 100,000 patient-years in the PMD and incidence rates in SEER were 32.0 and 15.9, respectively, for patients 0-17 years and 46.9 and 42.1 for patients 18-30 years old. Reporting rates were higher than SEER incidence rates for Hodgkin lymphoma in the 0-17 years age group. PMD reporting rates per 100,000 patient-years and SEER incidence rates per 100,000 person-years for Hodgkin lymphoma were 9.54 and 0.9, respectively, for patients 0-17 years and 1.8 and 4.2 for patients 18-30 years old. There were =5 cases of leukemia, lymphoma, melanoma, thyroid, and cervical cancers. Leukemia, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, melanoma, thyroid cancer, and cervical cancer rates were similar in the PMD and SEER. CONCLUSIONS: Overall PMD malignancy reporting rates in etanercept-treated patients 0-17 years appeared higher than incidence rates in SEER, attributable to rates of Hodgkin lymphoma. Comparison to patients with similar burden of disease cannot be made; JIA, particularly very active disease, may be a risk factor for lymphoma. No increased malignancy reporting rate in the PMD relative to SEER was observed in the young-adult age group.",,,,PMC3851136,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, direct comparisons between the differential effects of ABCB1 and ABCC1 have been difficult, since identical cell lines with differential expression of these transporters have not been developed. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: In this study, we developed and compared the biological profiles of Jurkat cell lines that selectively over-expressed ABCB1 and ABCC1. Vincristine (VCR) plays an important role in the treatment of T-lineage ALL (T-ALL), and is often the first drug given to newly-diagnosed patients. Because of its importance in treatment, we provided escalating, sub-lethal doses of VCR to Jurkat cells, and extended our observations to expression profiling of newly diagnosed patients with T-ALL. RESULTS: We found that VCR-resistant cells over-expressed ABCC1 nearly 30-fold. The calcein AM assay confirmed that VCR-resistant cells actively extruded VCR, and that ABCC1-mediated drug resistance conferred a different spectrum of multidrug resistance than other T-ALL induction agents. siRNA experiments that blocked ABCC1 export confirmed that VCR resistance could be reversed in vitro. Analyses of T-lymphoblasts obtained from 92 newly diagnosed T-ALL patients treated on Children's Oncology Group Phase III studies 8704/9404 showed that induction failure could be explained in all but one case by the over-expression of ABCB1 or ABCC1. CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, these results suggest that over-expression of ABC transporters plays a contributing role in mediating treatment failure in T-ALL, and underscore the need to employ alternate treatment approaches in patients for whom induction failed or for those with relapsed disease.",,['NOTNLM'],"['ATP binding cassette proteins C1 and B1', 'T-lineage acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'multi-drug resistance']",PMC3819435,,,"['U24 CA196173/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA118100/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA114589/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'UL1 TR000041/TR/NCATS NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA098543/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA098413/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'UL1 TR001449/TR/NCATS NIH HHS/United States', 'U24 CA114766/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",['NIHMS500734'],,,,,,,,

Bcl-2 strongly protected against roscovitine-induced apoptosis in neutrophils. The isolated loss of either Bim or noxa provided significant, partial protection while protection through combined loss of Bim and noxa or Bim and Puma was only slightly greater than this individual loss. The only substantial change in protein levels observed was the loss of Mcl-1, which was not transcriptional and was inhibited by proteasome blockade. In progenitor cells there was no protection by the loss of Bim alone but substantial protection by the loss of both Bim and Puma; surprisingly, strongest protection was seen by the isolated loss of noxa.

Recently, a deletion polymorphism in intron 2 of the BIM gene was demonstrated to confer an intrinsic TKI resistance in Asian patients. The present study aimed at identifying mutations in the BIM sequence that could lead to imatinib resistance independently of BCR-ABL mutations. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: BIM coding sequence analysis was performed in 72 imatinib-treated CML patients from a French population of our centre and in 29 healthy controls (reference population) as a case-control study. Real-time quantitative PCR (RT qPCR) was performed to assess Bim expression in our reference population. RESULTS: No mutation with amino-acid change was found in the BIM coding sequence. However, we observed a silent single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) c465C>T (rs724710). A strong statistical link was found between the presence of the T allele and the high Sokal risk group (p = 0.0065). T allele frequency was higher in non responsive patients than in the reference population (p = 0.0049). Similarly, this T allele was associated with the mutation frequency on the tyrosine kinase domain of BCR-ABL (p<0.001) and the presence of the T allele significantly lengthened the time to achieve a major molecular response (MMR). Finally, the presence of the T allele was related to a decreased basal expression of the Bim mRNA in the circulating mononuclear cells of healthy controls. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that the analysis of the c465C>T SNP of BIM could be useful for predicting the outcome of imatinib-treated CML patients.",,,,PMC3818406,,,,,,,,,,,,

The over expression of anti-apoptotic protein Mcl-1 has been associated with inferior survival, poor prognosis and chemoresistance of malignant melanoma. A BH3 mimetic, ABT-737, has demonstrated efficacy in several forms of cancers. However, the efficacy of ABT-737 depends on Mcl-1. Because the over expression of Mcl-1 is frequently observed in melanoma, specifically targeting of Mcl-1 may overcome the resistance of ABT-737. In this study, we investigated the effects of Maritoclax, a novel Mcl-1-selective inhibitor, alone and in combination with ABT-737, on the survival of human melanoma cells. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: For cell viability assessment we performed MTT assay. Apoptosis was determined using western blot and flow cytometric analysis. KEY RESULTS: The treatment of Maritoclax reduced the cell viability of melanoma cells with an IC50 of between 2.2-5.0 microM. Further, treatment of melanoma cells with Maritoclax showed significant decrease in Mcl-1 expression. We found that Maritoclax was able to induce apoptosis in melanoma cells in a caspase-dependent manner. Moreover, Maritoclax induced Mcl-1 degradation via the proteasome system, which was associated with its pro-apoptotic activity. We also found that Maritoclax treatment increased mitochondrial translocation of Bim and Bmf. Importantly, Maritoclax markedly enhanced the efficacy of ABT-737 against melanoma cells in both two- and three-dimensional spheroids. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: Taken together, these results suggest that targeting of Mcl-1 by Maritoclax may represent a new therapeutic strategy for melanoma treatment that warrants further investigation as a single therapy or in combination with other agents such as Bcl-2 inhibitors.",,,,PMC3817219,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we show that higher Th17 and IL-17A values were associated with less advanced clinical stage of CLL. Th17 cells' percentages in PB were lower in patients who died due to CLL during follow-up due to CLL (as compared to surviving patients) and in patients responding to first-line therapy with fludarabine-based regimens (as compared to non-responders). IL-17A inversely correlated with the time from CLL diagnosis to the start of therapy and was lower in patients who required treatment during follow-up. Th-17 and IL-17A values were lower in patients with adverse prognostic factors (17p and 11q deletion, CD38 and ZAP-70 expression). CLL patients with detectable IL-17A mRNA in T cells were in Rai Stage 0 and negative for both ZAP-70 and CD38 expression.

Immunofluorescence and western immunoblot analyses revealed that hypertension contributed to the activation of TLR4 and NF- kappa B, accompanied by significantly enhanced expression of proinflammatory mediators, such as tumor necrosis factor- alpha (TNF- alpha ), interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta ), and interleukin-18 (IL-18). Furthermore, expression of the antiapoptotic protein, myeloid cell leukemia-1 (Mcl1), was decreased, and the pro-apoptotic proteins, Bax and cleavedcaspase-3 p17 were increased in combined cerebral cortical/striatal soluble lysates. Scutellarin significantly lowered blood pressure and attenuated the number of activated microglia and macrophages in brains of hypertensive rats. Furthermore, scutellarin significantly reduced the expression of TLR4, NF- kappa B p65, TNF- alpha , IL-1 beta , IL-18, Bax and cleaved-caspase-3 p17, and increased the expression of Mcl1.

FLT3/ITDs are present in about 20-30% of all acute myeloid leukemia cases. It has been shown that the mutation is correlated with worse prognosis. However, none of the previous studies investigated which FAB subtype is associated with higher percentage of FLT3/ITD, thus the reason for undertaking the current study. METHODS: The prevalence and the potential prognostic impact of FLT3 mutations in 39 acute myeloid leukemia patients were analyzed by genomic polymerase chain reaction. Twelve samples with FLT3/ITDs and 27 acute myeloid leukemia samples without the mutations were compared with respect to clinical prognosis and FAB subtype. Results were correlated with cytogenetic data and the clinical response. RESULTS: FLT3/ITD mutations were found in 31% of patients. FLT3/ITD was associated with similar clinical characteristics and was more prevalent in patients with normal karyotype (83%). Interestingly, half of the FLT3/ITD aberrations were found in patients with FAB M1 (50%), and fewer were found in patients with FAB M2 (8%), M4 (8%), and M5 (8%). Although less frequent in patients with cytogenetic aberrations, FLT3/ITDs were found in 17% of patients with t(15;17). Although the study was powered to 80%, patients with FLT3/ITD mutation did not show shorter complete remission duration or a higher relapse rate. CONCLUSION: The data confirm that FLT3/ITD mutations represent a common alteration in adult acute myeloid leukemia, mainly with normal karyotype (83%) and de novo acute myeloid leukemia (75%), as compared to secondary acute myeloid leukemia (25%) (p<0.001). It also showed that half of the M1-FAB subtype is FLT3/ITD positive. Therefore, FLT3/ITD is a therapeutic target, and thus inhibition of FLT3 tyrosine kinase activity may provide a new approach in the treatment of leukemia carrying these mutations.",,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute Myeloid Leukemia', 'FLT3 gene', 'M1', 'Prognosis', 'Tandem duplication']",PMC3815853,,,,,,,,,,,,

Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is the most common type of malignant lymphoma. However, only 50% of patients experience long-term survival after current treatment; therefore, developing novel therapeutic strategies is warranted. Comparative proteomic analysis of two DLBCL lines with a B-lymphoblastoid cell line (LCL) showed differential expression of Ran GTPase-activating protein 1 (RanGAP1) between them, which was confirmed using immunoblotting. Immunostaining showed that the majority of DLBCLs (92%, 46/50) were RanGAP1(+), while reactive lymphoid hyperplasia (n = 12) was RanGAP1(+) predominantly in germinal centers. RanGAP1 was also highly expressed in other B-cell lymphomas (BCL, n = 180) with brisk mitotic activity (B-lymphoblastic lymphoma/leukemia: 93%, and Burkitt lymphoma: 95%) or cell-cycle dysregulation (mantle cell lymphoma: 83%, and Hodgkin's lymphoma 91%). Interestingly, serum RanGAP1 level was higher in patients with high-grade BCL (1.71 +/- 2.28 ng/mL, n = 62) than in low-grade BCL (0.75 +/- 2.12 ng/mL, n = 52) and healthy controls (0.55 +/- 1.58 ng/mL, n = 75) (high-grade BCL vs. low-grade BCL, p = 0.002; high-grade BCL vs. control, p < 0.001, Mann-Whitney U test).

LSC protein expression differed markedly from Bulk (n =31 cases, 93/121 proteins) and CD34+ cells (n = 30 cases, 88/121 proteins) with 54 proteins being significantly different (31 higher, 23 lower) in LSC than in either Bulk or CD34+ cells. Sixty-seven proteins differed significantly between CD34+ and Bulk blasts (n = 69 cases). Protein expression patterns in LSC and CD34+ differed markedly from normal CD34+ cells. LSC were distinct from CD34+ and Bulk cells by principal component and by protein signaling network analysis which confirmed individual protein analysis. Potential targetable submodules in LSC included the proteins PU.1(SP1), P27, Mcl1, HIF1alpha, cMET, P53, Yap, and phospho-Stats 1, 5 and 6.

However, coexpression networks built from experimental expression data are in general large highly connected networks with an elevated number of false-positive interactions (nodes and edges). In order to infer relevant information, the network must be properly filtered and its complexity reduced. Given the complexity and the multivariate nature of the information contained in the network, this requires the development and application of efficient feature selection algorithms to be able to exploit the topological characteristics of the network to identify relevant nodes and edges. This paper proposes an efficient multivariate filtering designed to analyze the topological properties of a coexpression network in order to identify potential relevant genes for a given disease. The algorithm has been tested on three datasets for three well known and studied diseases: acute myeloid leukemia, breast cancer, and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.

The prognostic factors and outcome of DS-ALL patients treated in contemporary protocols are uncertain. We studied 653 DS-ALL patients enrolled in 16 international trials from 1995 to 2004. Non-DS BCP-ALL patients from the Dutch Child Oncology Group and Berlin-Frankfurt-Munster were reference cohorts. DS-ALL patients had a higher 8-year cumulative incidence of relapse (26% +/- 2% vs 15% +/- 1%, P < .001) and 2-year treatment-related mortality (TRM) (7% +/- 1% vs 2.0% +/- <1%, P < .0001) than non-DS patients, resulting in lower 8-year event-free survival (EFS) (64% +/- 2% vs 81% +/- 2%, P < .0001) and overall survival (74% +/- 2% vs 89% +/- 1%, P < .0001). Independent favorable prognostic factors include age <6 years (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.58, P = .002), white blood cell (WBC) count <10 x 10(9)/L (HR = 0.60, P = .005), and ETV6-RUNX1 (HR = 0.14, P = .006) for EFS and age (HR = 0.48, P < .001), ETV6-RUNX1 (HR = 0.1, P = .016) and high hyperdiploidy (HeH) (HR = 0.29, P = .04) for relapse-free survival. TRM was the major cause of death in ETV6-RUNX1 and HeH DS-ALLs. Thus, while relapse is the main contributor to poorer survival in DS-ALL, infection-associated TRM was increased in all protocol elements, unrelated to treatment phase or regimen. Future strategies to improve outcome in DS-ALL should include improved supportive care throughout therapy and reduction of therapy in newly identified good-prognosis subgroups.",,,,PMC3879907,,,"['U10CA98413/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'G0300130/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom', 'U10 CA098543/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA068484/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', '5 P01CA068484/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA98543/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA098413/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U24 CA114766/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 2176/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA021765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,

DAVID was used to perform the biological process enrichment and KEGG pathway cluster analyses. We used the Cytoscape plug-in unit, Cluster ONE, to perform cluster module analysis to find hub proteins of the network module and to analyze their Gene Ontology (GO) functions. A total of 294 genes were found to be differentially expressed between normal and disease samples, which were used to construct the differential gene-protein interaction network. GO function analysis revealed that the genes' functions were mainly involved in the intracellular signaling cascade. KEGG pathway analysis suggested that the main metabolic pathways of these genes were those of cancer: the neurotrophin/T cell/Fc epsilon RI/B cell/ ErbB/p53 signaling pathway, the cell cycle pathway, and the chronic myeloid leukemia pathway. Screening analysis of hub proteins revealed that KRT18 had the highest hub degree. In conclusion, we found differentially expressed genes related to osteoporosis.

A possible chemosensitization by siRNA pre-treatment was also investigated. RESULTS: We observed that hBVR expression, protein, and enzymatic activity were significantly increased in multidrug-resistant HL60 leukemia cells. We also found that knockdown of hBVR reverses multidrug resistance in resistant leukemic HL60 cells by a ROS-dependent mechanism.

In the literature, it has been reported that single nucleotide variation of caveolin-1 gene (CAV1) plays an important role in risk of several types of cancer, such as hepatoma, leukemia, nasopharyngeal carcinoma, oral, breast, bladder and prostate cancer, but we are not aware of any reports on upper urothelial tract cancer. The aim of this study was to evaluate the association of six polymorphic genotypes of CAV1 with upper urothelial tract cancer within a Taiwanese population. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 218 patients with upper urothelial tract cancer and 580 healthy controls in central Taiwan were genotyped by polymerase chain reaction and restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) for six CAV1 polymorphic genotypes, C521A (rs1997623), G14713A (rs3807987), G21985A (rs12672038), T28608A (rs3757733), T29107A (rs7804372), and G32124A (rs3807992), and their association with upper urothelial tract cancer susceptibility was examined. RESULTS: The distribution of genotypes of CAV1 rs3807987 and rs7804372 were significantly different between cancer patient and control groups (p=0.0188 and 0.0090, respectively), while those for CAV1 rs1997623, rs12672038, rs3757733 and rs3807992 were not significant (p>0.05). The haplotype analysis of the two polymorphic genotypes showed that compared with the GG/AT, and GG/AA haplotypes of CAV1 rs3807987/rs7804372, those carrying GG/TT, AG/TT and AA/TT variants have a significantly increased risk of upper urothelial tract cancer (odds ratio=1.61, 1.50 and 2.67, 95% confidence interval=1.05-2.47, 1.18-1.90, and 1.37-5.18, respectively). On the contrary, other haplotype variants conferred non-significant elevated risk. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that individual and combined CAV1 rs3807987/rs7804372 genotypes are involved in predisposition to upper urothelial tract cancer in the Taiwanese population.",,['NOTNLM'],"['CAV1', 'genotype', 'polymorphism', 'upper urothelial track cancer']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2013 Sep 30.,,"INTRODUCTION: Philadelphia chromosome-negative myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs) include polycythemia vera (PV), essential thrombocythemia (ET), and primary myelofibrosis (PMF), and are characterized by clonal proliferation of hematopoietic cells in the bone marrow. There are numerous case reports and reviews reporting patients with coexisting MPN and plasma-cell disease such as multiple myeloma (MM) and monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS). METHODS: We report 15 patients treated at our institution over a 5-year period (January 2008 to December 2012) with a diagnosis of both an MPN and MGUS or MM. We also reviewed and summarized published case reports and studies describing the coexistence of these two disease entities. RESULTS: Most patients (12/15) had an MPN diagnosis made before or at the same time as the MGUS/MM diagnosis. Eventually, 2 patients developed a lymphoid leukemia, 1 patient developed lymphoma, and 1 patient developed acute myeloid leukemia, raising the question of whether patients with coexistence of myeloid- and lymphoid-derived neoplasms are more prone to leukemic or lymphomatous transformation. We did not find any treatment-related effect that could have contributed to the development of coexisting MGUS or MM and MPN. Of the 7 patients with an abnormal karyotype, 3 patients had trisomy 8. CONCLUSION: At present, management strategies are aimed at treating the MPN and regularly monitoring the MGUS for transformation to an overt plasma-cell malignancy. However, for patients who develop overt MM, management is focused more on treating the myeloma and monitoring the MPN. It has not yet been definitively shown that these 2 entities arise from a common-ancestor hematopoietic stem cell.",['Copyright (c) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

BMSCs were collected from 10 AML patients and 13 controls in order to examine the morphology, differentiation and adhesion molecule expression changes. It was observed that primary BMSCs from AML patients exhibited aberrant morphologies compared with those from the controls. Prior to adipogenic differentiation, the mRNA and protein levels of the lipid marker gene lipoprotein lipase, from the BMSCs of AML patients, were significantly higher. lipid drops were present early during differentiation in the BMSCs of AML patients and exhibited greater numbers later. Following adipogenic differentiation, the mRNA level of E-cadherin in the BMSCs of AML patients was significantly lower than that identified in the BMSCs of the control groups. Following osteogenic induction, the mRNA level of E-cadherin in the BMSCs of AML patients was significantly higher than in the controls. Therefore BMSCs from the AML patients exhibited irregular morphology, tendency to pre-differentiate to adipocytes and different adhesion molecule expression following differentiation.

The 12-gene Recurrence Score assay has been validated in patients with stage II colon cancer from the Cancer and Leukemia Group B 9581 and Quick and Simple and Reliable (QUASAR) trials. We conducted an independent, prospectively designed clinical validation study of Recurrence Score, with prespecified end points and analysis plan, in archival specimens from patients with stage II and III colon cancer randomly assigned to fluorouracil (FU) or FU plus oxaliplatin in National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project C-07. METHODS: Recurrence Score was assessed in 892 fixed, paraffin-embedded tumor specimens (randomly selected 50% of patients with tissue). Data were analyzed by Cox regression adjusting for stage and treatment. RESULTS: Continuous Recurrence Score predicted recurrence (hazard ratio for a 25-unit increase in score, 1.96; 95% CI, 1.50 to 2.55; P < .001), as well as disease-free and overall survival (both P < .001). Recurrence Score predicted recurrence risk (P = .001) after adjustment for stage, mismatch repair, nodes examined, grade, and treatment. Recurrence Score did not have significant interaction with stage (P = .90) or age (P = .76). Relative benefit of oxaliplatin was similar across the range of Recurrence Score (interaction P = .48); accordingly, absolute benefit of oxaliplatin increased with higher scores, most notably in patients with stage II and IIIA/B disease. CONCLUSION: The 12-gene Recurrence Score predicts recurrence risk in stage II and stage III colon cancer and provides additional information beyond conventional clinical and pathologic factors. Incorporating Recurrence Score into the clinical context may better inform adjuvant therapy decisions in stage III as well as stage II colon cancer.",,,,PMC3871512,,['ClinicalTrials.gov/NCT00004931'],"['U10-CA-69651/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10-CA-37377/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA012027/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA069651/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA069974/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA037377/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10-CA-69974/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10-CA-12027/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,['J Clin Oncol. 2014 Mar 10;32(8):866'],,,

Most of the deregulated proteins were related to protein folding, energy/primary metabolism, transcription/translation regulation and oxidative stress response. Protein network analysis suggested that glycolysis, gluconeogenesis and protein ubiquitination biosynthesis pathways were highly represented, confirming also the pivotal role of c-Myc. A specific reduced representation was observed for glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate-dehydrogenase and alpha-enolase, suggesting a possible role of c-Myb in the activation of aerobic glycolysis. A reduced amount was also observed for stress responsive heat shock 70kDa protein and 78kDa glucose-regulated protein, previously identified as direct targets of c-Myb. Among over-represented proteins, worth mentioning is the chromatin modifier chromobox protein homolog 3 that contributes to silencing of E2F- and Myc-responsive genes in quiescent G0 cells. Data here presented, while providing novel insights onto the molecular mechanisms underlying c-Myb activity, indicate potential protein biomarkers for monitoring the progression of chronic myeloid leukemia. BIOLOGICAL SIGNIFICANCE: Myeloid leukemia is a malignant disease of the hematopoietic system in which cells of myeloid lineages accumulate to an undifferentiated state. In particular, it was shown that an aberrant accumulation of the c-Myb transcriptional factor is associated with the suppression of normal differentiation processes promoting the development of the hematopoietic malignancies. Many efforts have been recently made to identify novel genes directly targeted by c-Myb at a transcriptome level. In this work, we originally describe a differential proteomic approach to facilitate the comprehension of the regulation of the protein networks exerted by c-Myb. Our study reveals a complex network of proteins regulated by c-Myb. The functional heterogeneity of these proteins emphasizes the pleiotropic role of c-Myb as a regulator of genes that are crucial for energy production and stress response in leukemia. In fact, variations in glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate-dehydrogenase and alpha-enolase suggest a possible role of c-Myb in the activation of aerobic glycolysis. Moreover, significant differences were found for heat shock 70kDa protein and 78kDa glucose-regulated protein known as direct c-Myb targets. This work highlights potential protein biomarkers to look into disease progression and to develop translational medicine approaches in myeloid leukemia.",['Copyright (c) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

However, results of recent studies suggest that combination therapy may benefit these patients when given early and again later in the treatment. We evaluated a combination maintenance/consolidation regimen (RVD) following autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT) for high-risk patients to evaluate the impact of this approach on outcome. Following initiation of RVD maintenance, 51% of patients achieved stringent complete response (sCR), with 96% achieving at least VGPR as best response.

TET2 gene mutations similar to those observed in myeloid and lymphoid malignancies also accumulate with age in otherwise healthy subjects with clonal hematopoiesis. TET2 is one of the three proteins of the TET (Ten-Eleven Translocation) family, which are evolutionarily conserved dioxygenases that catalyze the conversion of 5-methyl-cytosine (5-mC) to 5-hydroxymethyl-cytosine (5-hmC) and promote DNA demethylation. TET dioxygenases require 2-oxoglutarate, oxygen and Fe(II) for their activity, which is enhanced in the presence of ascorbic acid. TET2 is the most expressed TET gene in the hematopoietic tissue, especially in hematopoietic stem cells. In addition to their hydroxylase activity, TET proteins recruit the O-linked beta-D-N-acetylglucosamine (O-GlcNAc) transferase (OGT) enzyme to chromatin, which promotes post-transcriptional modifications of histones and facilitates gene expression. The TET2 level is regulated by interaction with IDAX, originating from TET2 gene fission during evolution, and by the microRNA miR-22. TET2 has pleiotropic roles during hematopoiesis, including stem-cell self-renewal, lineage commitment and terminal differentiation of monocytes. Analysis of Tet2 knockout mice, which are viable and fertile, demonstrated that Tet2 functions as a tumor suppressor whose haploinsufficiency initiates myeloid and lymphoid transformations. This review summarizes the recently identified TET2 physiological and pathological functions and discusses how this knowledge influences our therapeutic approaches in hematological malignancies and possibly other tumor types.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We determined the biological and prognostic significance of genetic aberrations in MDS. In total, 944 patients with various MDS subtypes were screened for known/putative mutations/deletions in 104 genes using targeted deep sequencing and array-based genomic hybridization. In total, 845/944 patients (89.5%) harbored at least one mutation (median, 3 per patient; range, 0-12). Forty-seven genes were significantly mutated with TET2, SF3B1, ASXL1, SRSF2, DNMT3A, and RUNX1 mutated in >10% of cases. Many mutations were associated with higher risk groups and/or blast elevation. Survival was investigated in 875 patients. By univariate analysis, 25/48 genes (resulting from 47 genes tested significantly plus PRPF8) affected survival (P<0.05). The status of 14 genes combined with conventional factors revealed a novel prognostic model ('Model-1') separating patients into four risk groups ('low', 'intermediate', 'high', 'very high risk') with 3-year survival of 95.2, 69.3, 32.8, and 5.3% (P<0.001). Subsequently, a 'gene-only model' ('Model-2') was constructed based on 14 genes also yielding four significant risk groups (P<0.001). Both models were reproducible in the validation cohort (n=175 patients; P<0.001 each).

Here we validate this hypothesis, demonstrating the efficacy of the BET inhibitor I-BET151 across a variety of AML subtypes driven by disparate mutations. We demonstrate that a common 'core' transcriptional program, which is HOX gene independent, is downregulated in AML and underlies sensitivity to I-BET treatment. This program is enriched for genes that contain 'super-enhancers', recently described regulatory elements postulated to control key oncogenic driver genes. Moreover, our program can independently classify AML patients into distinct cytogenetic and molecular subgroups, suggesting that it contains biomarkers of sensitivity and response. We focus AML with mutations of the Nucleophosmin gene (NPM1) and show evidence to suggest that wild-type NPM1 has an inhibitory influence on BRD4 that is relieved upon NPM1c mutation and cytosplasmic dislocation. This leads to the upregulation of the core transcriptional program facilitating leukemia development. This program is abrogated by I-BET therapy and by nuclear restoration of NPM1. Finally, we demonstrate the efficacy of I-BET151 in a unique murine model and in primary patient samples of NPM1c AML.

Expert assessment is often used to assess lifetime occupational exposures, but these assessments generally lack transparency and are very time-consuming. We explored the agreement between a rule-based assessment approach and case-by-case expert assessment of occupational exposures in a community-based study. METHODS: We used data from a case-control study of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukaemia in which parental occupational exposures were originally assigned by expert assessment. Key questions were identified from the completed parent questionnaires and, on the basis of these, rules were written to assign exposure levels to diesel exhaust, pesticides and solvents. We estimated exposure prevalence separately for fathers and mothers, and used kappa statistics to assess the agreement between the two exposure assessment methods. RESULTS: Exposures were assigned to 5829 jobs among 1079 men and 6189 jobs among 1234 women. For both sexes, agreement was good for the two assessment methods of exposure to diesel exhaust at a job level (kappa=0.70 for men and kappa=0.71 for women) and at a person level (kappa=0.74 and kappa=0.75). The agreement was good to excellent for pesticide exposure among men (kappa=0.74 for jobs and kappa=0.84 at a person level) and women (kappa=0.68 and kappa=0.71 at a job and person level, respectively). Moderate to good agreement was observed for assessment of solvent exposure, which was better for women than men. CONCLUSIONS: The rule-based assessment approach appeared to be an efficient alternative for assigning occupational exposures in a community-based study for a selection of occupational exposures.",,,,,['Aus-ALL consortium'],,,,,,,,,,"['Armstrong B', 'van Bockxmeer F', 'Haber M', 'Scott R', 'Attia J', 'Norris M', 'Bower C', 'de Klerk N', 'Kees U', 'Miller M', 'Thompson J', 'Bailey H', 'Alvaro F', 'Cole C', 'Pozza LD', 'Daubenton J', 'Downie P', 'Lockwood L', 'Kirby M', 'Marshall G', 'Smibert E', 'Suppiah R']","['Armstrong, Bruce', 'van Bockxmeer, Frank', 'Haber, Michelle', 'Scott, Rodney', 'Attia, John', 'Norris, Murray', 'Bower, Carol', 'de Klerk, Nicholas', 'Kees, Ursula', 'Miller, Margaret', 'Thompson, Judith', 'Bailey, Helen', 'Alvaro, Frank', 'Cole, Catherine', 'Pozza, Luciano Dalla', 'Daubenton, John', 'Downie, Peter', 'Lockwood, Liane', 'Kirby, Maria', 'Marshall, Glenn', 'Smibert, Elizabeth', 'Suppiah, Ram']"

To do that, we used a Sweetana-Grass type of diffusion chambers with segments of rat intestine as a model of the intestinal mucosa, measured the permeability coefficients of imatinib and its major metabolite (N-desmethyl imatinib) in both directions with and without specific and general inhibition of active transport, and calculated the efflux ratios. The results show that the good bioavailability of imatinib is highly likely achieved by its active absorption from the intestine and that its active elimination through the intestinal mucosa is mediated by a synergistic activity of organic cation transporter 1 in the basolateral membrane and the added activity of two efflux proteins (P-glycoprotein and breast cancer resistant protein) in the apical membrane of enterocytes of the rat ileum.

The remaining 60-65% of elderly AML patients receives supportive care only. Nevertheless, several studies have indicated that patients who receive any therapy had a better outcome if compared with patients who receive supportive care only. Thus, the development of novel, less toxic, targeted agents is offering new options to older AML patients who are unfit for intensive approaches.

The clinical course can however be predicted thanks to prognostic markers. Poor prognosis is associated with expression of a B cell receptor (BCR) from unmutated immunoglobulin variable heavy-chain genes (IGHV) and expression of zeta-associated protein of 70 kDa (ZAP70). The reason why ZAP70 expression is associated with poor prognosis and whether the protein has a direct pathogenic function is at present unknown. By transfer of ZAP70 to CLL cells, we show here that expression of ZAP70 in CLL cells leads to increased expression of the nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB target genes interleukin-1beta (IL1B), IL6 and IL8 upon BCR triggering. This could be blocked by inhibition of NF-kappaB signalling through inhibition of IkappaB kinases (IKK). Transcriptome analysis identified a NF-kappaB RELA signature imposed by ZAP70 expression in BCR-stimulated CLL cells. We conclude that ZAP70 acts directly as an amplifier of NF-kappaB signalling in CLL cells which could be an underlying mechanism for its association with poor prognosis and which may represent a therapeutic target.",['(c) 2013 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.'],['NOTNLM'],"['B-cell receptor', 'chronic lymphocytic leukaemia', 'nuclear factor-kappaB', 'zeta-associated protein of 70']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

He received allo peripheral blood-SCT (PBSCT) from his mother. The hematopoietic cells successfully engrafted, but the mixed chimerism of 2 donors persisted. On day 149, he had a fever, and hemophagocytosis was found by bone marrow aspiration. EBV genomic DNA was detected for 1.62 x 10(3) copies. CMV and fungus were negative in blood. On day 165, the patient had been observed disturbance of consciousness, neck stiffness, and died on day 170 due to multiple organ failure. Autopsy examination showed infiltration of CD20+ leukemic cells into the perivascular space of cerebrum, brainstem and spinal cord, with hemophagocytosis by CD6+ macrophages. In situ hybridization of EB-virus encoded small RNA (EBER) confirmed EBV infection of B-lymphoblastic cells infiltrated in the cerebrum. HPS was considered to be triggered by the reactivation of EBV, due to hematopoietic dysfunction based on long-term immunosuppressive treatment and mixed chimerism derived from a HSCT from 2 donors.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Individual paralog groups control proximodistal patterning of the limb skeletal elements. Hox9 genes also initiate the onset of Hand2 expression in the posterior forelimb compartment, and collectively, the posterior HoxA/D genes maintain posterior Sonic Hedgehog (Shh) expression. Here we show that an anterior Hox paralog group, Hox5, is required for forelimb anterior patterning. Deletion of all three Hox5 genes (Hoxa5, Hoxb5, and Hoxc5) leads to anterior forelimb defects resulting from derepression of Shh expression. The phenotype requires the loss of all three Hox5 genes, demonstrating the high level of redundancy in this Hox paralogous group. Further analyses reveal that Hox5 interacts with promyelocytic leukemia zinc finger biochemically and genetically to restrict Shh expression. These findings, along with previous reports showing that point mutations in the Shh limb enhancer lead to similar anterior limb defects, highlight the importance of Shh repression for proper patterning of the vertebrate limb.",,['NOTNLM'],"['anteroposterior limb patterning', 'gene interactions', 'limb development', 'mouse developmental genetics', 'organogenesis']",PMC3845161,,,"['T32 HL007749/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'UL1RR024986/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', 'AR061402/AR/NIAMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 NS072804/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AR061402/AR/NIAMS NIH HHS/United States', 'UL1 RR024986/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', 'AR057018/AR/NIAMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AR057018/AR/NIAMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 NS053976/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,

Germline ASXL1 mutations occur in patients with Bohring-Opitz syndrome. Here, we show that constitutive loss of Asxl1 results in developmental abnormalities, including anophthalmia, microcephaly, cleft palates, and mandibular malformations. In contrast, hematopoietic-specific deletion of Asxl1 results in progressive, multilineage cytopenias and dysplasia in the context of increased numbers of hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells, characteristic features of human MDS. Serial transplantation of Asxl1-null hematopoietic cells results in a lethal myeloid disorder at a shorter latency than primary Asxl1 knockout (KO) mice. Asxl1 deletion reduces hematopoietic stem cell self-renewal, which is restored by concomitant deletion of Tet2, a gene commonly co-mutated with ASXL1 in MDS patients. Moreover, compound Asxl1/Tet2 deletion results in an MDS phenotype with hastened death compared with single-gene KO mice. Asxl1 loss results in a global reduction of H3K27 trimethylation and dysregulated expression of known regulators of hematopoiesis. RNA-Seq/ChIP-Seq analyses of Asxl1 in hematopoietic cells identify a subset of differentially expressed genes as direct targets of Asxl1.

The initial part of the study carried out in solution confirmed that the insertion of a glycine bridge allowed retention of the LK15 alpha-helicity, and fluorescence correlation spectroscopy did not reveal preferential conformations at the studied concentrations. In the second part, TatLK15 uptake mechanisms appeared peptide dose- and cell line- dependent as well as requiring membrane potential. Below a critical dose, TatLK15 toxicity appeared limited for approximately three hours as demonstrated by the combined use of lactate dehydrogenase release, MTT assays, and time-dependent observation of membrane-impermeant dye uptake using high content screening apparatus. Furthermore, toxicity was observed to occur rapidly at higher peptide doses.

The relationship between the polymorphisms and clinical and laboratory features of the patients and response to therapy were determined. No significant differences in genotype and allele frequencies between the patients and the control subjects at positions -670 and -1377 were detected.

The introduction of all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) into anthracycline-based induction chemotherapy regimens has dramatically improved overall survival of individuals with APL, although hemorrhage-related death during the early phase of therapy remains a serious problem. Moreover, population-based studies have shown that the incidence of early death during induction chemotherapy is nearly 30 %, and the most common cause of death is associated with hemorrhage. Thus, development of a novel treatment strategy to alleviate abnormal coagulation in APL patients is urgently required. Recombinant human soluble thrombomodulin (rTM) comprises the active extracellular domain of TM, and has been used for treatment of DIC since 2008 in Japan. Use of rTM in combination with remission induction chemotherapy, including ATRA, produces potent resolution of DIC without exacerbation of bleeding tendency in individuals with APL.

ER stress results from the accumulation of misfolded proteins during stress conditions. However, the precise mechanisms by which ER stress modulates inflammation remain incompletely understood. In this study, we hypothesized that ER stress alone could represent a sufficient signal for the modulation of inflammasome-dependent cytokine responses. We found that several ER stress-inducing chemicals and the free fatty acid palmitate can trigger IL-1beta secretion in various cell types, including monocytic leukemia cells, primary macrophages and differentiated adipocytes. We show that ER stress primes cells for the expression of pro-IL-1beta via NF-kappaB activation and promotes IL-1beta secretion. Enhanced IL-1beta secretion depended on the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome through a mechanism involving reactive oxygen species formation and activation of thioredoxin-interacting protein. Chemical chaperone treatment and the pharmacological application of carbon monoxide inhibited IL-1beta secretion in response to ER stress. Our results provide a mechanistic link between ER stress and the regulation of inflammation, and suggest that modulation of ER stress may provide a therapeutic opportunity to block progression of low grade chronic inflammation to metabolic syndrome.","['(c) The Author(s) 2013 Reprints and permissions:', 'sagepub.co.uk/journalsPermissions.nav.']",['NOTNLM'],"['ER stress', 'carbon monoxide', 'heme oxygenase-1', 'inflammasome', 'reactive oxygen species']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2013 Nov 8.,,"Burkitt lymphoma (BL) is an aggressive mature B-cell neoplasm. The cytogenetic hallmark are MYC-involving translocations, most frequently as t(8;14)(q24;q32). Additional cytogenetic abnormalities are seen in the majority of cases. The most frequent additional aberration involves the long arm of chromosome 1, either as partial or complete trisomy 1q. A very rare additional aberration is a supernumerary isochromosome 1q, i(1)(q10), resulting in tetrasomy 1q. The biological significance of this aberration is unclear. We present a highly aggressive case of BL in a child with immature B-cell immunophenotype (IP) and supernumerary i(1)(q10). Diagnostic karyotyping showed 47,XY,+i(1)(q10),t(8;14)(q24;q32)[2]/47,idem,del(15)(q24)[21]/46,XY[2]. aCGH analysis detected a gain of 1p12qter and a loss of 15q22q25. FISH analysis confirmed the isodicentric chromosome 1, which has not previously been reported in BL. In the literature, supernumerary i(1)(q10) was found in 11 cases of which >80% presented with immature B-cell IP and >60% relapsed or died. Tetrasomy 1q resulting from supernumerary idic(1)(p12) or i(1)(q10) is a rare genetic event in BL and probably associated with immature B-cell IP. We propose that high amplification of genes on chromosome 1p12qter may contribute to the BL IP and disease progression.","['(c) 2013 S. Karger AG, Basel.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To determine the utility of CUSA-derived glioma tissue for experimental research, we collected 48 CUSA specimen bottles from glioma patients and analyzed both the solid tissue fragments and dissociated tumor cells suspended in the liquid waste fraction. We investigated if these fractions would be useful for analyzing tumor heterogeneity, using IHC and multi-parameter flow cytometry; we also assessed culture generation and orthotopic xenograft potential. Both cell sources proved to be an abundant, highly viable source of live tumor cells for cytometric analysis, animal studies and in-vitro studies. Our findings demonstrate that CUSA tissue represents an abundant viable source to conduct experimental research and to carry out diagnostic analyses by flow cytometry or other molecular diagnostic procedures.",,,,PMC3730332,,,,,,,,,,,,

Interactions with the CK2beta regulatory subunit of the enzyme target its catalytic subunit (CK2alpha or CK2alpha') to specific substrates; however, little is known about the mechanisms by which these interactions occur. We previously showed that by binding CK2beta, the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) EBNA1 protein recruits CK2 to promyelocytic leukemia (PML) nuclear bodies, where increased CK2-mediated phosphorylation of PML proteins triggers their degradation. Here we have identified a KSSR motif near the dimerization interface of CK2beta as forming part of a protein interaction pocket that mediates interaction with EBNA1. We show that the EBNA1-CK2beta interaction is primed by phosphorylation of EBNA1 on S393 (within a polyserine region). This phosphoserine is critical for EBNA1-induced PML degradation but does not affect EBNA1 functions in EBV replication or segregation. Using comparative proteomics of wild-type (WT) and KSSR mutant CK2beta, we identified an uncharacterized cellular protein, C18orf25/ARKL1, that also binds CK2beta through the KSSR motif and show that this involves a polyserine sequence resembling the CK2beta binding sequence in EBNA1. Therefore, we have identified a new mechanism of CK2 interaction used by viral and cellular proteins.",,,,PMC3911286,,,,,,,,,,,,

Furthermore, a fusion transcript HLXB9-ETV6 is found in approximately 50% of t(7;12) cases, making the reverse transcription PCR approach not an ideal screening method. Considering the report of few cases of variant translocations harbouring a cryptic t(7;12) rearrangement, we believe that the actual incidence of this abnormality is higher than reported to date. The clinical outcome of t(7;12) patients is believed to be poor, therefore an early and accurate diagnosis is important in the clinical management and treatment. In this study, we have designed and tested a novel three-colour FISH approach that enabled us not only to confirm the presence of the t(7;12) in a number of patients studied previously, but also to identify a cryptic t(7;12) as part of a complex rearrangement.

In particular, ASXL1 mutations are common in patients with hematologic malignancies associated with myelodysplasia, including myelodysplastic syndromes (MDSs), and chronic myelomonocytic leukemia. Although loss-of-function ASXL1 mutations promote myeloid transformation, a large subset of ASXL1 mutations is thought to result in stable truncation of ASXL1. Here we demonstrate that C-terminal-truncating Asxl1 mutations (ASXL1-MTs) inhibited myeloid differentiation and induced MDS-like disease in mice. ASXL1-MT mice displayed features of human-associated MDS, including multi-lineage myelodysplasia, pancytopenia, and occasional progression to overt leukemia. ASXL1-MT resulted in derepression of homeobox A9 (Hoxa9) and microRNA-125a (miR-125a) expression through inhibition of polycomb repressive complex 2-mediated (PRC2-mediated) methylation of histone H3K27. miR-125a reduced expression of C-type lectin domain family 5, member a (Clec5a), which is involved in myeloid differentiation. In addition, HOXA9 expression was high in MDS patients with ASXL1-MT, while CLEC5A expression was generally low. Thus, ASXL1-MT-induced MDS-like disease in mice is associated with derepression of Hoxa9 and miR-125a and with Clec5a dysregulation. Our data provide evidence for an axis of MDS pathogenesis that implicates both ASXL1 mutations and miR-125a as therapeutic targets in MDS.",,,,PMC3809801,,"['GEO/GSE49117', 'GEO/GSE49118']",['P30 CA008748/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,

We investigated whether replenishing EZH2 could reverse the age-dependent increase of Ink4a transcription. We generated an inducible pancreatic beta cell-specific Ezh2 transgenic mouse model and showed that transgene expression of Ezh2 was sufficient to increase beta cell replication and regeneration in young adult mice. In mice older than 8 months, induction of Ezh2 was unable to repress Ink4a. Older mice had an enrichment of a trithorax group (TrxG) protein complex at the Ink4a locus. Knockdown of TrxG complex components, in conjunction with expression of Ezh2, resulted in Ink4a repression and increased replication of beta cells in aged mice. These results indicate that combined modulation of polycomb group proteins, such as EZH2, along with TrxG proteins to repress Ink4a can rejuvenate the replication capacity of aged beta cells.

First, these animals would have phenotypes that are robust and reproducible. Second, these models would reliably develop phenotypes that accurately recapitulate disease observed in the clinic with short latency and high penetrance sufficient for informative preclinical therapeutic studies. Leukemia models based on retroviral transduction of oncogenes followed by transplantation into irradiated syngeneic hosts offer a rapid and cost-efficient way to evaluate the effects of a gene or mutation of interest but in some cases result in inconsistent phenotypes due to non-physiological levels of expression and random genomic integration. Xenotransplantation models enable the propagation and analysis of primary human samples but may be difficult to interpret due to variability of genetic background, the effects of immune recognition, a limited knowledge of genetic alterations in samples before and after xenotransplantation, and incomplete interaction with the microenvironment. Genetically engineered mice represent tractable models of human myeloid malignancies, and in many cases empower the study of the molecular pathogenesis of leukemia and evaluation of novel chemotherapeutics. Our understanding of the molecular pathogenesis of myeloid malignancies relies largely on the knowledge of cytogenetic abnormalities and recurrent chromosomal translocations, many of which have been successfully modeled in laboratory animals.

One such enzyme is CD38 which, alongside synthesising Ca(2+)-releasing second messengers and acting as a cell surface receptor, has also been suggested to play a key role in NAD(+) homeostasis. CD38 is well known as a negative prognostic marker in B-CLL but the role of its enzymatic activity has not been studied in depth to date. We have exploited the HL-60 cell line as a model of inducible CD38 expression, to investigate CD38-mediated regulation intracellular NAD(+) levels and the consequences of changes in NAD(+) levels on cell physiology. Intracellular NAD(+) levels fell with increasing CD38 expression and this was reversed with the CD38 inhibitor, kuromanin confirming the key role of CD38 in NAD(+) homeostasis. We also measured the consequences of CD38 expression during the differentiation on a number of functions linked to NAD(+) and we show that some but not all NAD(+)-dependent processes are significantly affected by the lowered NAD(+) levels. These data suggest that both functional roles of CD38 might be important in the pathogenesis of B-CLL.",['Copyright (c) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

A recurrent viral infection is an attractive hypothesis repeatedly found in the literature since it would explain the persistent pain and tiredness these patients suffer from. The initial striking link of two distinct orphan retroviruses: the gamma retroviruses murine leukemia virus (MLV)-related virus and the delta retrovirus T-lymphotropic virus type 2 (HTLV-2) to chronic fatigue have not been confirmed to date. RESULTS: Genomic DNA (gDNA) from 75 fibromyalgia patients suffering from chronic fatigue and 79 age-matched local healthy controls were screened for the presence of MLV-related and HTLV-2 related proviral sequences. The XMRV env gene was amplified in 20% of samples tested (24% patients/15% healthy controls). Unexpectedly, no PCR amplifications from independent gDNA preparations of the same individuals were obtained. None of the positive samples showed presence of contaminating murine sequences previously reported by other investigators, neither contained additional regions of the virus making us conclude that the initial env amplification came from spurious air-driven amplicon contaminants. No specific HTLV-2 sequences were obtained at any time from any of the 154 quality-controlled gDNA preparations screened. CONCLUSIONS: Previous associations between MLV-related or HTLV-2 retrovirus infection with chronic fatigue must be discarded. Thus, studies showing positive amplification of HTLV-2 sequences from chronic fatigue participants should be revised for possible undetected technical problems.To avoid false positives of viral infection, not only extreme precautions should be taken when nested-PCR reactions are prepared and exhaustive foreign DNA contamination controls performed, but also consistent amplification of diverse regions of the virus in independent preparations from the same individual must be demanded.The fact that our cohort of patients did not present evidence of any of the two types of retroviral infection formerly associated to chronic fatigue does not rule out the possibility that other viruses are involved in inciting or maintaining fibromyalgia and/or chronic fatigue conditions.",,,,PMC4226024,,,,,,,,,,,,

While the diagnosis of a perforated ulcer is straightforward in typical cases, its clinical onset may be subtle because of comorbidities and/or concurrent therapies. CASE PRESENTATION: We report the case of a 53-year-old Caucasian man with a history of chronic myeloid leukemia on maintenance therapy (100mg/day) with imatinib who was found to have a subphrenic abscess resulting from a perforated duodenal ulcer that had been clinically overlooked. Our patient was febrile (38.5 degrees C) with abdominal tenderness and hypoactive bowel sounds. On the abdominal plain X-ray films, a right subphrenic abscess could be seen. On contrast-enhanced multi-detector computed tomography, a huge air-fluid collection extending from the subphrenic to the subhepatic anterior space was observed. After oral administration of 500cm3 of 3 percent diluted diatrizoate meglumine, an extraluminal leakage of the water-soluble iodinated contrast media could then be appreciated as a result of a perforated duodenal ulcer. During surgery, the abscess was drained and extensive adhesiolysis had to be performed to expose the duodenal bulb where the ulcer was first identified by methylene blue administration and then sutured. CONCLUSIONS: While subphrenic abscesses are well known complications of perforated gastric or duodenal ulcers, they have nowadays become rare thanks to advances in both diagnostic and therapeutic strategies for peptic ulcer disease. However, when peptic ulcer disease is not clinically suspected, the contribution of imaging may be substantial.",,,,PMC3835032,,,,,,,,,,,,

Imatinib is actively transported into cells by the SLC22A1 transporter (hOCT1) and its genetic variants may affect intracellular drug import. We studied the effect of SLC22A1 genetic variants on long-term outcomes of imatinib treated patients. METHODS: A total of 167 patients, 94% in chronic phase, were analyzed for rs41267797, rs683369, rs12208357, and rs628031 variants using the Sequenom MassARRAY platform. RESULTS: Rates of CHR, MCyR, CCyR, and MMolR were not significantly different according to allelic variants. However, patients with AA or GA rs628031 genotypes had a higher incidence of poor response to imatinib compared to the GG genotype (47% compared to 29%, P = 0.06), and a higher rate of KD mutation discovery (8/16 vs. 5/27, P = 0.04), suggesting that secondary resistance was more common in these genotypes. Median EFS was shorter for rs628031 genotype AA/AG compared with the GG genotype (61 months and not reached, respectively, P = 0.05), and 5 yr OS rates were lower for patients with the rs628031 genotypes AA/AG compared with the GG genotype (88% and 97%, respectively, P = 0.03). Patients with AA/GA rs628031 and additional rare genotypes had worse EFS and OS compared to patients with only AA/GA rs628031 (P = 0.02 for EFS and 0.01 for OS). There was no difference in pretreatment SLC22A1 mRNA expression levels in patients with rs628031 genotypes GG/AA or GA. CONCLUSIONS: Studying SLC22A1 genetic variants prior to TKI initiation could influence treatment decisions.",['(c) 2013 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

However, little is known about the efficacy of 6-shogaol on leukemia cells. Here we investigated the underlying mechanism of 6-shogaol induced apoptosis in human leukemia cells in vitro and in vivo. METHODS: Three leukemia cell lines and primary leukemia cells were used to investigate the apoptosis effect of 6-shogaol. A shotgun approach based on label-free proteome with LC-CHIP Q-TOF MS/MS was employed to identify the cellular targets of 6-shogaol and the differentially expressed proteins were analyzed by bioinformatics protocols. RESULTS: The present study indicated that 6-shogaol selectively induced apoptosis in transformed and primary leukemia cells but not in normal cells. Eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 alpha (eIF2alpha), a key regulator in apoptosis signaling pathway, was significantly affected in both Jurkat and U937 proteome profiles. The docking results suggested that 6-shogaol might bind well to eIF2alpha at Ser51 of the N-terminal domain. Immunoblotting data indicated that 6-shogaol induced apoptosis through a process involving dephosphorylation of eIF2alpha and caspase activation-dependent cleavage of eIF2alpha. Furthermore, 6-shogaol markedly inhibited tumor growth and induced apoptosis in U937 xenograft mouse model. CONCLUSION: The potent anti-leukemia activity of 6-shogaol found both in vitro and in vivo in our study make this compound a potential anti-tumor agent for hematologic malignancies.",,,,PMC4176122,,,,,,,,,,,,

EP is a small hydrazone molecule which interacts with the transmembrane domain of TPO-R and promotes megakaryopoiesis, and a subsequent increase in platelet number. To date, multiple large clinical trials have demonstrated the ability of EP to reduce the burden of thrombocytopenia and its associated side effects in patients with chronic immune thrombocytopenia purpura and patients with hepatitis-C related thrombocytopenia. Given these promising results and the morbidity associated with thrombocytopenia in cancer patients, there is significant interest in investigating the role of EP for thrombocytopenia secondary to myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML). AREAS COVERED: In this review, the authors address the potential utility of EP for patients with AML and MDS with thrombocytopenia. The review provides an overview of the rationale for the development of EP in AML and MDS, and the mechanism(s) of action of EP. The authors focus on preclinical data describing the effectiveness of EP as both a platelet-stimulating, and an anti-leukemia agent and describe the use of EP in clinical trials. EXPERT OPINION: EP has the potential to be an effective supportive care agent, improving platelet counts and decreasing thrombocytopenia-related morbidity, in patients with AML and MDS. Large, randomized clinical trials are needed to assess the efficacy of EP in reducing the duration and severity of thrombocytopenia, as well assess the clinical utility of EP as an anti-leukemia agent.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, it is known that cure of CLL is only possible if a graft-versus-leukemia effect is present. Between 1994 and 2007, 48 adults underwent allo-SCT for poor-risk CLL in Sweden. Of these, ten (21%) patients aged 24-53 years (median: 46 years) received myeloablative conditioning (MAC), based on TBI and cyclophosphamide. All MAC patients had refractory, poorly controlled CLL before allo-SCT (partial remission in 9/10 patients and progressive disease in one). The cumulative incidence of acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) grades II-IV was 30%. Nine patients developed chronic GVHD; extensive in four. Rates of nonrelapse mortality at 1, 3 and 10 years were 0, 10 and 20%, respectively. Two patients relapsed 36 and 53 months after transplantation. Six patients were still alive after a median follow-up time of 11.5 years (range 5.9-13.7). The probabilities of relapse-free and overall survival from 1, 3 and 5 years after transplantation were 100, 90 and 70%, and 100, 90 and 80%, respectively. Nevertheless, our analysis of long-term outcome after MAC allo-SCT for CLL suggests that younger patients with poorly controlled CLL may benefit from MAC allo-SCT.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Protein synthesis inhibition has been reported to sensitize cancer cells to apoptosis-inducing agents, but the detailed mechanism by which protein synthesis inhibition sensitize cells to TRAIL has not been determined. To investigate the mechanism underlying pancreatic cancer cell resistance to TRAIL, we performed a small scale high-throughput compound screening in AsPC-1 pancreatic cancer cells using a bioactive small molecule library. We identified 8 compounds that reproducibly sensitize AsPC-1 cells to TRAIL-induced apoptosis. One of these compounds, emetine hydrochloride, when combined with subtoxic concentrations of TRAIL, induced massive apoptosis in AsPC-1 and BxPC-3 pancreatic cancer cells. Cell death analysis revealed that the sensitizing effects of emetine were specific to TRAIL. Emetine downregulated the expression of the TRAIL-related anti-apoptotic protein Mcl-1 in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Furthermore, specific knockdown of Mcl-1 using small interfering RNA without emetine treatment sensitized pancreatic cancer cells to TRAIL. Emetine sensitization of pancreatic cancer cells to TRAIL via Mcl-1 was confirmed under hypoxic conditions. Taken together, these findings strongly suggest that Mcl-1 is involved in pancreatic cancer cell resistance to TRAIL, and emetine facilitates the apoptosis of TRAIL-tolerant pancreatic cancer cells by specifically inhibiting Mcl-1 function.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Treatment failure is associated with intrinsic or acquired apoptosis resistance and the presence of a highly tumourigenic subpopulation of cancer cells called GBM stem cells. Tumour necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) has emerged as a promising novel therapy for some treatment-resistant tumours but unfortunately GBM can be completely resistant to TRAIL monotherapy. In this study, we identified Mcl-1, an anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family member, as a critical player involved in determining the sensitivity of GBM to TRAIL-induced apoptosis. Effective targeting of Mcl-1 in TRAIL resistant GBM cells, either by gene silencing technology or by treatment with R-roscovitine, a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor that targets Mcl-1, was demonstrated to augment sensitivity to TRAIL, both within GBM cells grown as monolayers and in a 3D tumour model. Finally, we highlight that two separate pathways are activated during the apoptotic death of GBM cells treated with a combination of TRAIL and R-roscovitine, one which leads to caspase-8 and caspase-3 activation and a second pathway, involving a Mcl-1:Noxa axis. In conclusion, our study demonstrates that R-roscovitine in combination with TRAIL presents a promising novel strategy to trigger cell death pathways in glioblastoma.",,,,PMC3938842,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epigenetic changes are established through multiple mechanisms that include DNA methylation, non-coding RNAs and the covalent modification of specific residues on histone proteins. It is becoming clear not only that aberrant epigenetic changes are common in many human diseases such as leukemia, but that these changes by their very nature are malleable, and thus are amenable to treatment. Epigenetic based therapies have so far focused on the use of histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors and DNA methyltransferase inhibitors, which tend to have more general and widespread effects on gene regulation in the cell. However, if a unique molecular pathway can be identified, diseases caused by epigenetic mechanisms are excellent candidates for the development of more targeted therapies that focus on specific gene targets, individual binding domains, or specific enzymatic activities. Designing effective targeted therapies depends on a clear understanding of the role of epigenetic mutations during disease progression. The Mixed Lineage Leukemia (MLL) protein is an example of a developmentally important protein that controls the epigenetic activation of gene targets in part by methylating histone 3 on lysine 4. MLL is required for normal development, but is also mutated in a subset of aggressive human leukemias and thus provides a useful model for studying the link between epigenetic cell memory and human disease. The most common MLL mutations are chromosome translocations that fuse the MLL gene in frame with partner genes creating novel fusion proteins. In this review, we summarize recent work that argues MLL fusion proteins could function through a single molecular pathway, but we also highlight important data that suggests instead that multiple independent mechanisms underlie MLL mediated leukemogenesis.",,,,PMC3712720,,,['MC_UU_12009/6/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom'],,,,,,,,,

Because tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha is known to be elevated in AML, we also investigated the effect of TNF-alpha on MT1-MMP expression. We found (i) MT1-MMP mRNA expression in 41 out of 43 primary AML samples tested; (ii) activation of proMMP-2 in co-cultures of AML cells with normal bone marrow stromal cells; and (iii) inhibition of proMMP-2 activation and trans-Matrigel migration of AML cells by gene silencing using MT1-MMP siRNA. Moreover, recombinant human TNF-alpha upregulated MT1-MMP expression in AML cells resulting in enhanced proMMP-2 activation and trans-Matrigel migration. Thus, AML cells express MT1-MMP and TNF-alpha enhances it leading to increased MMP-2 activation and most likely contributing to the invasive phenotype.

Fifty nine patients were eligible for the study of 160 patients transplanted over ten years. For the MRD assessment we used multiparametric flow cytometry, cytogenetics and fluorescent in situ hybridization; 19 patients (32.2%) were identified as MRD positive. Patients with MRD had a consistently worse outcome over those without MRD, with 3-years leukemia-free survival (LFS) of 15.8% vs. 62.4% and overall survival (OS) of 17.5% vs. 62.3%. Relapse rate was significantly higher in MRD-positive patients; 3 years relapse rate in MRD-positive patients was 57.9% vs. 15.1% in MRD-negative patients. Detection of MRD in complete remission was associated with increased overall mortality (HR = 3.3; 95% CI: 1.45-7.57; p = 0.0044) and relapse (HR = 5.26; 95% CI: 2.0-14.0; p = 0.001), even after controlling for other risk factors.

We have previously shown that in utero benzene exposure can alter the redox-sensitive transcription factor NF-kappaB, and we hypothesize that this is through benzene-induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) production interfering with the signaling pathway involving NF-kappaB and p38-Mitogen Activated Protein Kinase (MAPK). As benzoquinone (BQ) is one of benzene's most toxic metabolites, the objectives of this study were to determine whether ROS and p38-MAPK-mediated BQ-induced increased NF-kappaB activity. HD3 chicken erythroblast cells were transfected with an NF-kappaB luciferase-linked reporter plasmid and exposed to BQ (25 muM) for 2-24 h. NF-kappaB activities were determined through luciferase assays; Western blotting was conducted to assess changes in protein levels in nontransfected cells; and the presence of ROS was determined via 2',7'-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (DCFDA) flow cytometric assays. Results demonstrated that NF-kappaB activity was significantly increased following exposure to BQ for 16 and 24 h and DCFDA assays and pretreatment with antioxidants indicated that BQ-mediated ROS production was responsible for this increase. Furthermore, decreased inhibitor of kappaB-alpha (IkappaB-alpha) expression suggests that nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) translocates into the nucleus and that p38-MAPK activation through a ROS-dependent pathway mediates BQ-mediated increases in NF-kappaB activity. Future studies investigating the role of p38-MAPK in this pathway are warranted. Evaluating the effects of toxicant exposure on cell signaling pathways is vital for understanding mechanisms of xenobiotic-induced toxicity.",,['NOTNLM'],"['IkappaB-alpha', 'NF-kappaB', 'benzoquinone', 'p38-MAPK', 'reactive oxygen species.']",,,,['MOP 111259/Canadian Institutes of Health Research/Canada'],,,,,,,,,

A very attractive way to treat myeloid leukemia, which is now called 'differentiation therapy', was proposed as in vitro studies have shown that a variety of agents stimulate differentiation of the cell lines isolated from leukemic patients. One of the differentiation-inducing agents, all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA), which can induce granulocytic differentiation in myeloid leukemic cell lines, has been introduced into clinics to treat patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) in which a PML-RARA fusion protein is generated by a t(15;17)(q22;q12) chromosomal translocation. Because differentiation therapy using ATRA has significantly improved prognosis for patients with APL, many efforts have been made to find alternative differentiating agents. Since 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25D) is capable of inducing in vitro monocyte/macrophage differentiation of myeloid leukemic cells, clinical trials have been performed to estimate its potential to treat patients with AML or myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). Unfortunately therapeutic concentrations of 1,25D can induce potentially fatal systemic hypercalcemia, thus limiting clinical utility of that compound. Attempts to overcome this problem have focused on the synthesis of 1,25D analogs (VDAs) which retain differentiation inducing potential, but lack its hypercalcemic effects. This review aims to discuss current problems and potential solutions in differentiation therapy of AML.",,,,PMC3757424,,,,,,,,,,,,

Under normal cellular conditions Nrf2 can be described as an anti-tumor molecule due to its induction of cytoprotective genes which protect cells from electrophile and oxidative damage. However in cancerous cells, Nrf2 takes on a pro-tumoral identity as the same cytoprotective genes can enhance resistance of those cancer cells to chemotherapeutic drugs. Such Nrf2-regulated cytoprotective genes include heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), which has been shown to protect human leukemia cells from apoptotic signals. Moreover, a relationship between Nrf2 and the nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) signaling pathway has been recently identified, and is now recognized as an important cross-talk mechanism by which Nrf2 can overcome apoptosis and provide cells with reduced sensitivity towards chemotherapeutic agents. In recent years a number of important research papers have highlighted the role of Nrf2 in providing protection against both current and new chemotherapeutic drugs in blood cancer.

We evaluated the activity of lenalidomide inside an in vitro coculture system of endothelial and CLL cells. Lenalidomide was able to inhibit CLL survival advantage mediated by endothelial contact. Moreover, the marked increase of in vitro angiogenesis determined by CLL-derived conditioned media was reduced by lenalidomide. We also analyzed peripheral blood collected from 27 patients with relapsed or refractory CLL being treated with lenalidomide within a phase II trial. Plasma levels of VEGF and THBS-1 decreased, whereas Ang2 and Ang increased during treatment. Patients who respond to lenalidomide showed a more pronounced decrease of VEGF and bFGF than did patients with stable or progressive disease (p = 0.007 and p = 0.005). Furthermore, lenalidomide reduced circulating endothelial cells and endothelial progenitors by increasing the percentage of apoptotic cells. Conversely, for six matched bone marrow biopsies available before and after treatment, we did not detect any modification in vessel density, suggesting a possible mechanism of vessel normalization rather than regression. In conclusion, our study provides further evidence that the anti-CLL effect of lenalidomide is mediated through the alteration of microenvironmental elements, implying the modulation of several angiogenesis-related factors and disruption of CLL crosstalk with endothelial cells.","['Copyright (c) 2014 ISEH - Society for Hematology and Stem Cells.

However, above a sequence difference threshold, recombination is impaired. It may then be advantageous for new species to arise. Building on the work of Grantham and others critical of the neutralist viewpoint, heuristic support for this hypothesis emerged from studies of the base composition and structure of retroviral genomes. The extreme enrichment in the purine A of the RNA of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1), parallels the mild purine-loading of the RNAs of most organisms, for which there is an adaptive explanation--immune evasion. However, human T cell leukaemia virus (HTLV-1), with the potential to invade the same host cell, shows extreme enrichment in the pyrimidine C. Assuming the low GC% HIV and the high GC% HTLV-1 to share a common ancestor, it was postulated that differences in GC% had arisen to prevent homologous recombination between these emerging lentiviral species. Sympatrically isolated by this intracellular reproductive barrier, prototypic HIV-1 seized the AU-rich (low GC%) high ground (thus committing to purine A rather than purine G). Prototypic HTLV-1 forwent this advantage and evolved an independent evolutionary strategy--similar to that of the GC%-rich Epstein-Barr virus--profound latency maintained by transcription of one purine-rich mRNA. The evidence supporting these interpretations is reviewed.","['Copyright (c) 2013 Institut Pasteur. Published by Elsevier Masson SAS.

The aim of our study was to investigate the functional role of both miR-101 and EZH2 in human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). METHODS: MiR-101 and EZH2 expressions were evaluated in tumor tissues of 99 HCC patients and 7 liver cancer cell lines by real-time PCR. Luciferase reporter assay was employed to validate whether EZH2 represents a target gene of miR-101. The effect of miR-101 on HCC growth as well as programmed cell death was studied in vitro and in vivo. RESULTS: MiR-101 expression was significantly downregulated in most of HCC tissues and all cell lines, whereas EZH2 was significantly overexpressed in most of HCC tissues and all cell lines. There was a negative correlation between expression levels of miR-101 and EZH2. Luciferase assay results confirmed EZH2 as a direct target gene of miR-101, which negatively regulates EZH2 expression in HCC. Ectopic overexpression of miR-101 dramatically repressed proliferation, invasion, colony formation as well as cell cycle progression in vitro and suppressed tumorigenicity in vivo. Furthermore, miR-101 inhibited autophagy and synergized with either doxorubicin or fluorouracil to induce apoptosis in tumor cells. CONCLUSION: Tumor suppressor miR-101 represses HCC progression through directly targeting EZH2 oncogene and sensitizes liver cancer cells to chemotherapeutic treatment. Our findings provide significant insights into molecular mechanisms of hepatocarcinogenesis and may have clinical relevance for the development of novel targeted therapies for HCC.","['Copyright (c) 2013 European Association for the Study of the Liver.

To determine whether JNKs are required for stem cell self-renewal or differentiation, we performed a phosphorylation kinase array assay to compare mouse ES cells under LIF+ or LIF- culture conditions. The data showed that activation of JNKs was induced by LIF withdrawal. We also found that JNK1 or 2 phosphorylated Klf4 at threonines 224 and 225. Activation of JNK signaling and phosphorylation of Klf4 inhibited Klf4 transcription and transactivation activity. Importantly, jnk1(-/-) and jnk2(-/-) murine embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) exhibited a significantly greater potency in the ability to increase the number of iPS colonies compared with jnk wildtype MEFs.

The leukemic progenitor cell line KG1a (CD7+) constitutively expresses GM-CSF while the parental KG1 (CD7-) cell line does not. This study focuses on the molecular basis of CD7 mediated GM-CSF regulation. METHODS: KG1a cells were treated with recombinant SECTM1-Fc protein, the PI3K kinase inhibitors wortmannin, LY292004, or PI4K activator spermine. Stable KG1-CD7+, KG1a-shCD7, KG1a-shETS1 as well as KG1a-GFP, KG1a-PKCbetaII-GFP cell lines were generated and the levels of CD7, GM-CSF and ETS-1 mRNA and protein were compared by real-time-PCR, western blotting, flow cytometry and ELISA. RESULTS: SECTM1 is expressed in Human Bone Marrow Endothelial Cells (HBMEC) and its expression can be upregulated by both IFN-gamma. KG1a cells demonstrated high expression levels of CD7 and ETS-1 allowing a constitutative signaling through the PI3K/Atk pathway to promote GM-CSF expression, while KG1 cells with low expression of CD7 and ETS-1 showed low GM-CSF expression. On KG1a cells GM-CSF expression could be negatively regulated by PI3K inhibitors or by recombinant SECTM1-Fc. Overexpression of CD7 in KG1 cells was insufficient to promote GM-CSF expression, while silencing of CD7 or ETS-1 resulted in reduced GM-CSF expression levels. Differentiation capable KG1a cells overexpressing PKCbetaII illustrated complete loss of CD7, but maintained normal levels of both ETS-1 and GM-CSF expression. CONCLUSION: These findings add an additional layer to the previously described autocrine/paracrine signaling between leukemic progenitor cells and the bone marrow microenvironment and highlight a role for SECTM1 in both normal and malignant hematopoiesis. GENERAL SIGNIFICANCE: This work shows that SECTM1 secreted from bone marrow stromal cells may interact with CD7 to influence GM-CSF expression in leukemic cells.",['(c) 2013.'],['NOTNLM'],"['Acute myeloid leukemia', 'CD7', 'ETS1', 'GM-CSF', 'Hematopoietic progenitors', 'SECTM1', 'secreted and transmembrane protein 1']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, data on continuous long-term dasatinib exposure of AML cells are limited and the potential effects on KIT inhibition and dasatinib sensitivity are unexplored. Treatment-related resistance ultimately limits clinical efficacy of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI), which could similarly apply to dasatinib in t(8;21) AML. In this study, we used the dasatinib-sensitive KIT(mut) t(8;21) AML cell line Kasumi-1 to model, in a confined and controllable way, molecular effects upon continuous dasatinib treatment. Long-term dasatinib exposure at clinically relevant levels resulted in markedly decreased drug-sensitivity of KIT(mut) t(8;21) AML cells. Notably, all dasatinib-resistant clones lacked secondary KIT-mutations. Instead, persistent growth correlated with alterations in KIT expression levels-that is, either KIT overexpression with maintained downstream signaling or KIT downregulation with concomitant activation of alternate pathways. Although KIT overexpression was associated with retained receptor activity and STAT3 activation, KIT downregulation correlated with decreased STAT3 levels and increased ERK-signaling. Importantly, brief discontinuation of dasatinib restored dasatinib-sensitivity associated with reversal of signaling signatures similar to treatment-naive, dasatinib-sensitive cells. The observed desensitization of KIT(mut) t(8;21) AML cells upon continuous dasatinib exposure suggests that therapy-related acquisition of resistance could pose significant limitations on therapeutic efficiency. Notably, we identified TKI-resistant states of transient nature that correlate with alterations in KIT expression and can be reversed upon brief inhibitor withdrawal. These findings indicate that discontinuing treatment maintains dasatinib sensitivity in KIT(mut) AML cells.","['Copyright (c) 2014 ISEH - Society for Hematology and Stem Cells.

Epub 2013 Nov 6.,,"BACKGROUND: Cancer in children is increasingly recognized as a major and growing health problem in different developed and developing countries. In Yemen, it is still difficult to know the extent of cancer and its determinants among children. This study was conducted to determine the magnitude of childhood cancer in Aden and provide the preliminary baseline data by age and sex. METHODS: Basic epidemiologic data was retrieved from all paediatric cancer <15 years age registered in Aden Caner Registry (ACR), Yemen, from 1997 to 2006. RESULTS: The results showed a total of 483 childhood cancers <15 years age comprising 12.7% of all registered malignancies with a male to female ratio of 1.5:1. The predominant age affected was 5-9 years in (38.3%) children. The most frequent cancer among Yemeni children was leukaemia 160 (33.1%) followed by lymphoma 152 (31.5%), CNS tumors 35 (7.2%) and bone tumours 25 (5.2%). An interesting and unusual finding was the frequency of acute myeloid leukaemia twice more common in female (66.7%) than male (33.3%). Lymphoma was the most common cancer in children >5 years. An interesting comparison was the preponderance of non-Hodgkins's lymphoma over Hodgkin's disease (1.6:1) stronger in female (3:1) than male (1.25:1). Medulloblastoma was the most common CNS tumour followed by astrocytoma, an infrequent finding in childhood cancer. Osteosarcoma was the most frequent bone tumour (male:female ratio of 1.8:1). A female preponderance was noticed in chondrosarcoma that was not yet documented. The blastoma group was common in younger age group. Retinoblastoma and nephroblastoma predominated in female while neuroblastoma, hepatoblastoma and soft tissue sarcomas in male. CONCLUSION: It is concluded that there is a lower frequency of childhood cancer in Aden when compared with developed countries. It may explained by the fact that a large number of childhood cancers remain undiagnosed due to limitations of diagnostic facilities or under registration.

PATIENT AND METHODS: This case report is about a patient who developed an uncommon localization of aspergillosis: prostatic and renal, after a treatment by alemtuzumab monotherapy. During the week 8 of alemtuzumab, the patient presented fever, urinary frequency and urologic symptoms. Persistance of fever with common antibiotherapy led to realize a tomography that showed prostatic and renal abscess (70mm and 29mm). It was decided to realize a prostatic biopsy. RESULTS: Histological findings showed suppurative abscess with ischemic necrosis and fungal proliferation, with branched fungal hyphae. Direct examination was negative. Culture on Sabouraud's agar revealed a mould identified as Aspergillus fumigatus. The organism was susceptible to voriconazole (MIC: voriconazole 0,25ug/mL). CONCLUSION: Because of the main side effect of alemtuzumab is immunosuppression, we have to research fungal infections such as Aspergillosis, particularly in patients with fever resistant to common antibiotherapy.",['Copyright (c) 2013 Elsevier Masson SAS.

Autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) has never been considered a standard of care in this setting. The aim of our study was to analyse if results of ASCT improved in the era of TKIs. PATIENTS AND METHODS: One-hundred and seventy-seven adults with Ph+ ALL treated with ASCT in first complete remission were analysed for the impact of year of transplantation on outcome. Additional analysis was performed including 32 patients for whom detailed data on the use of TKIs and the status of minimal residual disease were collected. RESULTS: The probability of the overall survival (OS) at 3 years increased from 16% for transplants performed between 1996 and 2001 to 48% between 2002 and 2006 and 57% between 2007 and 2010 (P<.0001). Leukaemia-free survival (LFS) was 11%, 39% and 52%, respectively (P<.0001). Relapse incidence decreased from 70% to 45% and 45% (P=.01), respectively, while non-relapse mortality was 19%, 15% and 3% (P=.08). In a multivariate analysis, year of ASCT was the only independent factor influencing the risk of treatment failure (hazard ratio (HR)=0.37; P<.001). In a subgroup of 22 patients actually treated with TKIs and being in complete molecular remission at the time of ASCT, the LFS rate at 3 years was 65%. CONCLUSIONS: Results of ASCT for Ph+ ALL improved significantly over time.

Early studies indicated that leukotoxin is specific for WBC from humans and Old World primates. In the current study, we used in vivo and in vitro assays to show that leukotoxin has a wider host range than previously believed and can kill rodent WBC. Administration of leukotoxin to rats and mice resulted in a rapid drop in WBC number but had no effect on RBC or platelet counts. Using LFA1-knockout mice, we showed that leukotoxin-mediated depletion of WBC is dependent on LFA1. In addition, similar to its effect on human monocytes, leukotoxin kills murine myeloid leukemia via a lysosome-mediated pathway that is dependent on cathepsin D. This newly described broader host range of leukotoxin enables the biology of the protein to be studied in rodent species and offers the possibility of using rodent models for evaluating the therapeutic efficacy of leukotoxin in various diseases.",,,,PMC3750668,,,,,,,,,,,,

The profoundly different Nef/glycoGag responsiveness of a neutralization-resistant and a neutralization-sensitive R5-tropic Env could be switched by exchanging their gp120 V1/V2 regions, which also switches their neutralization sensitivity. Within V1/V2, the same determinants governed Nef/glycoGag responsiveness and neutralization sensitivity, indicating that these phenotypes are mechanistically linked. The V1/V2 and V3 regions, which form an apical trimer-association domain, together determined the Nef and glycoGag responsiveness of an X4-tropic Env.

The MR imaging protocol consisted of T2-weighted, fluid attenuation inversion recovery (FLAIR), diffusion weighting imaging (DWI) and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) sequences. Contrast enhanced computed tomography (CT) of the brain revealed bilateral symmetric subcortical hypodense lesions in the parieto-occipital regions. T2-weighted and FLAIR sequences showed bilateral, symmetrical focal cortical and subcortical hyperintensities involving the parietal and occipital lobes. These areas appeared hyperintense on DWI while the ADC (Apparent Diffusion Coefficient) maps demonstrated higher apparent diffusion coefficients in areas of FLAIR abnormalities thus confirming vasogenic edema. Follow-up scan five days later showed improvement or resolution of the abnormalities. Transient DWI hyperintensities seen in cortical watershed areas corresponding to the hyperintense foci in FLAIR imaging are suggestive of foci of vasogenic edema secondary to vasospasm in highly ischemia-sensitive cerebral tissue.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Yet, the lack of viable synthetic routes for re-elaborating this complex natural product has represented a fundamental obstacle toward further optimization of its pharmacological properties. Here, we demonstrate how this challenge could be addressed via selective, late-stage sp(3) C-H bond functionalization mediated by P450 catalysts with tailored site-selectivity. Taking advantage of our recently introduced tools for high-throughput P450 fingerprinting and fingerprint-driven P450 reactivity prediction, we evolved P450 variants useful for carrying out the highly regioselective hydroxylation of two aliphatic sites (C9 and C14) in parthenolide carbocyclic backbone. By chemoenzymatic synthesis, a panel of novel C9- and C14-modified parthenolide analogs were generated in order to gain initial structure-activity insights on these previously inaccessible sites of the molecule. Notably, some of these compounds were found to possess significantly improved antileukemic potency against primary acute myeloid leukemia cells, while exhibiting low toxicity against normal mature and progenitor hematopoietic cells. By identifying two 'hot spots' for improving the anticancer properties of parthenolide, this study highlights the potential of P450-mediated C-H functionalization as an enabling, new strategy for the late-stage manipulation of bioactive natural product scaffolds.",,,,PMC3904131,,,['R01 GM098628/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States'],['NIHMS539117'],,,,,,,,

METHODS: In 38 patients with hematological malignancies, 24-hour electrocardiography Holter monitoring , with HRV and HRT analysis before HSCT (A test) and after HSCT (B test), was performed. RESULTS: The 24-hour analysis of HRV demonstrated that SDNN, SDNNi, rMSSD, and pNN50 parameters were significantly lower after HSCT as compared to the results obtained before the transplantation (P < 0.05). For period of diurnal activity and for night hours, SDANN, SDNNi, rMSSD, and pNN50 were significantly lower in B test, as compared to the results of A test (P < 0.05). The analysis of HRT demonstrated that turbulence onset parameter was significantly higher, and turbulence slope parameter was significantly lower in B test, as compared to A test (P < 0.05). The multifactorial stepwise backward regression analysis indicated that administration of cyclophosphamide and carmustine and higher concentrations of blood cholesterol represented risk factors for decreased HRV. Cyclophosphamide and higher triglyceride levels represented independent risk factors for decreased HRT.

The results of quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) analyses showed that the expression levels of CAMKIIgamma, KI67, HSP70 and HSP90 genes were up-regulated at diagnosis, and in cases with signs of treatment resistance both in chronic and advanced phases (accelerated and blastic phases) with respect to chronic phase in remission and healthy donors. When only 56 resistant cases, 31 with mutations (MT) and 25 without mutations (WT), in the BCR-ABL1 tyrosine kinase domain were considered, the transcript expression profile showed an unexpected significant increase in CAMKIIgamma and HSP70, and a significant decrease in HSP90 in MT versus WT cases. This differential transcript expression prompted us to design an expression score, log(CAMKIIgamma x HSP70/HSP90), which can be used to provide rapid screening to discriminate the presence or absence of mutations in resistant cells and to monitor TKI treatment efficacy in patients with CML.",,['NOTNLM'],"['BCR-ABL1', 'CAMKIIgamma', 'Chronic myeloid leukemia', 'HSP70', 'HSP90', 'gene expression']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Picropodophyllin (PPP) is a potent, selective inhibitor of IGF-IR that is currently used with notable success in clinical trials that include patients with aggressive types of epithelial tumors. In the present study, we tested the effects of PPP on Jurkat and Molt-3 cells; two prototype T-LBL cell lines. Our results demonstrate that PPP efficiently induced apoptotic cell death and cell cycle arrest of these two cells. These effects were attributable to alterations of downstream target proteins. By using proteomic analysis, seven different proteins were found to be affected by PPP treatment of Jurkat cells. These proteins are involved in various aspects of cellular metabolism, cytoskeleton organization and signal transduction pathways. The results suggest that PPP affects multiple signaling molecules and inhibits fundamental pathways that control cell growth and survival.

At the same time tumors established versatile mechanisms for silencing the immune responses. The interplay is far from being completely understood. In this study we show contacts between tumor cells and lymphocytes revealing novel characteristics in the interaction of T cells and cancer cells in a way not previously described. METHODS/ FINDINGS: Experiments are based on the usage of a hydrophilic fluorescent dye that occurs free in the cytosol and thus transfer of fluorescent cytosol from one cell to the other can be observed using flow cytometry. Tumor cells from cell lines of different origin or primary hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells were incubated with lymphocytes from human and mice. This exposure provoked a contact dependent uptake of tumor derived cytosol by lymphocytes--even in CD4(+) T cells and murine B cells--which could not be detected after incubation of lymphocytes with healthy cells. The interaction was a direct one, not requiring the presence of accessory cells, but independent of cytotoxicity and TCR engagement. Electron microscopy disclosed 100-200 nm large gaps in the cell membranes of connected cells which separated viable and revealed astonishing outcome. While the lymphocytes were induced to proliferate in a long term fashion, the tumor cells underwent a temporary break in cell division. The in vitro results were confirmed in vivo using a murine acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) model. The arrest of tumor proliferation resulted in a significant prolonged survival of challenged mice. CONCLUSIONS: The reported cell-cell contacts reveal new characteristics i.e. the enabling of cytosol flow between the cells including biological active proteins that influence the cell cycle and biological behaviour of the recipient cells. This adds a completely new aspect in tumor induced immunology.",,,,PMC3813479,,,,,,,,,,,,

We and others have previously demonstrated that RTK ROR1 is overexpressed in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Silencing siRNA downregulated ROR1 and induced apoptosis of CLL cells. In the present study we analysed ROR1 isoforms and the phosphorylation pattern in CLL cells (n=38) applying western blot and flow-cytometry using anti-ROR1 antibodies and an anti-phospho-ROR1 antibody against the TK domain. Two major ROR1 bands with the size of 105 and 130 kDa respectively were identified, presumably representing unglycosylated (immature) and glycosylated (mature) ROR1 respectively as well as a 260 kDa band which may represent dimerized ROR1. A ROR1 band of 64 kDa that may correspond to a C-terminal fragment was also noted, present only in the nucleus. The 105 kDa ROR1 isoform was more frequently expressed in non-progressive as compared to progressive CLL patients (p=0.03). The 64, 105, 130 and 260 kDa bands were constitutively phosphorylated both at tyrosine and serine residues. Phosphorylation intensity of the mature (130 kDa) isoform was significantly higher in progressive than in non-progressive disease (p<0.001). Incubation of CLL cells with a mouse anti-ROR1 KNG or an anti-ROR1 CRD mAb respectively induced dephosphorylation of ROR1 before entering apoptosis. In conclusion CLL cells expressed different isoforms of ROR1 which were constitutively phosphorylated. The mature, phosphorylated ROR1 isoform was associated with a progressive disease stage. Targeting ROR1 by mAbs induced specific dephosphorylation and leukemic cell death. ROR1 might be an interesting therapeutic target.",,,,PMC3813472,,,,,,,,,,,,

A stable packaging cell line was established to produce clinical grade vector pseudotyped with the Gibbon Ape Leukaemia Virus (GALV). T cells were transduced in a closed bag system following activation with anti-CD3/CD28 beads, and enriched on the basis of CD34 expression. Engineered cells were administered in two escalating doses to three children receiving T-depleted, CD34 stem cell selected, mismatched allogeneic grafts. All patients had pre-existing viral infections and received chemotherapy conditioning without serotherapy. In all three subjects cell therapy was tolerated without acute toxicity or the development of acute GVHD. Circulating gene modified T cells were detectable by flow cytometry and by molecular tracking in all three subjects. There was resolution of virus infections, concordant with detectable antigen-specific T cell responses and gene modified cells persisted for over 12 months. These findings highlight the suitability of tCD34 as a GMP compliant selection marker and demonstrate the feasibility, safety and immunological potential of HSVTK-tCD34 suicide gene modified donor T cells.

METHODS AND RESULTS: One hundred adult survivors (57 males) of childhood acute leukaemias, aged 24.1 +/- 4.2 years, and 42 age-matched controls (26 males) were studied. Plasma cTnT was determined using a highly sensitive assay. Genotyping of NAD(P)H oxidase and multidrug resistance protein polymorphisms was performed. Left ventricular function was assessed by conventional, three-dimensional, and speckle tracking echocardiography. The medians (interquartile range) of hs-cTnT in male and female survivors were 4.9 (4.2 to 7.2) ng/L and 1.0 (1.0 to 3.5) ng/L, respectively. Nineteen survivors (13 males, 6 females) (19%) had elevated hs-cTnT (>95(th) centile of controls). Compared to those without elevated hs-TnT levels, these subjects had received larger cumulative anthracycline dose and were more likely to have leukaemic relapse, stem cell transplant, and cardiac irradiation. Their LV systolic and early diastolic myocardial velocities, isovolumic acceleration, and systolic longitudinal strain rate were significantly lower. Survivors having CT/TT at CYBA rs4673 had higher hs-cTnT levels than those with CC genotype. Functionally, increased hs-cTnT levels were associated with worse LV longitudinal systolic strain and systolic and diastolic strain rates. CONCLUSIONS: Increased hs-cTnT levels occur in a significant proportion of adult survivors of childhood acute leukaemias and are associated with larger cumulative anthracycline dose received, history of leukaemic relapse, stem cell transplant, and cardiac irradiation, genetic variants in free radical metabolism, and worse LV myocardial deformation.",,,,PMC3804508,,,,,,,,,,,,

Dysregulation of ETS transcription factors is also known to exist in Ewing's sarcoma, breast cancer, and acute lymphoblastic leukemia. We previously discovered that ERG, the predominant ETS family member in prostate cancer, interacts with the DNA damage response protein poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP1) in human prostate cancer specimens. Therefore, we hypothesized that the ERG-PARP1 interaction may confer radiation resistance by increasing DNA repair efficiency and that this radio-resistance could be reversed through PARP1 inhibition. Using lentiviral approaches, we established isogenic models of ERG overexpression in PC3 and DU145 prostate cancer cell lines. In both cell lines, ERG overexpression increased clonogenic survival following radiation by 1.25 (+/-0.07) fold (mean +/- SEM) and also resulted in increased PARP1 activity. PARP1 inhibition with olaparib preferentially radiosensitized ERG-positive cells by a factor of 1.52 (+/-0.03) relative to ERG-negative cells (P < .05). Neutral and alkaline COMET assays and immunofluorescence microscopy assessing gamma-H2AX foci showed increased short- and long-term efficiencies of DNA repair, respectively, following radiation that was preferentially reversed by PARP1 inhibition. These findings were verified in an in vivo xenograft model. Our findings demonstrate that ERG overexpression confers radiation resistance through increased efficiency of DNA repair following radiation that can be reversed through inhibition of PARP1. These results motivate the use of PARP1 inhibitors as radiosensitizers in patients with localized ETS fusion-positive cancers.",,,,PMC3819636,,,"['P50 CA069568/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'HHMI/Howard Hughes Medical Institute/United States', 'P50 CA69568/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,

Results from tissue culture experiments in prostate cancer cells suggest that PI3K inhibitors should be combined with other cytotoxic agents; however, the general toxicity of such combinations prevents translating these experimental data into preclinical and clinical models. We investigated the emerging concept of tumor-targeted synthetic lethality in prostate cancer cells by using the pan-PI3K inhibitor ZSTK474 and the immunotoxin J591PE, a protein chimera between the single-chain variable fragment of the monoclonal antibody J591 against the prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) and the truncated form of the Pseudomonas aeruginosa exotoxin A (PE38QQR). The combination of ZSTK474 and J591PE increased apoptosis within 6 hours and cell death (monitored at 24-48 hours) in the PSMA-expressing cells LNCaP, C4-2, and C4-2Luc but not in control cells that do not express PSMA (PC3 and BT549 cells). Mechanistic analysis suggested that induction of apoptosis requires Bcl-2-associated death promoter (BAD) dephosphorylation and decreased expression of myeloid leukemia cell differentiation protein 1 (MCL-1). A single injection of ZSTK474 and J591PE into engrafted prostate cancer C4-2Luc cells led to consistent and stable reduction of luminescence within 6 days. These results suggest that the combination of a PI3K inhibitor and a PSMA-targeted protein synthesis inhibitor toxin represents a promising novel strategy for advanced prostate cancer therapy that should be further investigated.",,,,PMC3819633,,,"['R01 CA118329/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R25 GM064249/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 CA079448/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01CA118329/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,

An early and accurate diagnosis of this clinical picture is very important for adequate patient management. CASE PRESENTATION: We report the atypical onset of T-lineage ALL in a 31-year-old man. The patient was admitted to the emergency room due to lung failure; at that moment, the patient's initial blood count was normal; the chest X-ray radiography showed a massive pleural effusion and a thoracentesis was carried out. Routine investigations performed on the pleural fluid using a new technology system and digitalized cell analysis demonstrated infiltration by immature cells. Therefore, bone marrow aspirate and flow cytometry analyses were performed, leading to the diagnosis of T-lineage ALL. A cord blood transplantation procedure was performed at the first hematological remission following chemotherapy regimens. The patient died of septic shock. CONCLUSION: The case we reported underlines the usefulness of using automated instruments to identify abnormal lymphoid cells in body fluids.",,['NOTNLM'],"['digital morphology', 'leukemia', 'pleural effusion']",PMC3818024,,,,,,,,,,,,

Among a series of tested analogs the diastereomeric analog PRI-2202 showed the strongest antiproliferative activity on the human breast cancer cell line MCF-7, whereas the geometric analog PRI-2205 was the weakest. Both analogs were less potent in antiproliferative activity against HL-60 cells compared to the reference compounds. The ability to potentiate antiproliferative effect of cisplatin or doxorubicin against HL-60 cells or that of tamoxifen against the MCF-7 cell line was observed at higher doses of PRI-2202 or PRI-2205 than those of the reference compounds. The proapoptotic activity of tamoxifen, expressed as the diminished mitochondrial membrane potential, as well as the increased phosphatidylserine expression, was partially attenuated by calcitriol, PRI-2191, PRI-2201 and PRI-2205. The treatment of the MCF-7 cells with tamoxifen alone resulted in an increase in VDR expression. Moreover, a further increase in VDR expression was observed when the analogs PRI-2201 or PRI-2205, but not PRI-2191, were used in combination with tamoxifen.

The chromosomal domains of G0S2 and CDKN1A are 140-170 kb in size and contain one and three VDR binding sites, respectively. This is rather compact compared to the MYC locus that is 15 times larger and accommodates four VDR binding sites. All eight VDR binding sites were studied by chromatin immunoprecipitation in THP-1 cells. Interestingly, the site closest to the transcription start site of the down-regulated MYC gene showed 1,25(OH)2D3-dependent reduction of VDR binding and is not associated with open chromatin. Four of the other seven VDR binding regions contain a typical DR3-type VDR binding sequence, three of which are also occupied with VDR in macrophage-like cells.

As in most cancers, short telomeres are one of the features of CML cells, and telomere shortening accentuates as the disease progresses from the chronic phase to the blastic phase. Although most individual telomeres are short, some of them are lengthened, and long individual telomeres occur non-randomly and might be associated with clonal selection. Telomerase is the main mechanism used to maintain telomere lengths, and its activity increases when CML evolves toward advanced stages. ALT might be another mechanism employed by CML cells to sustain the homeostasis of their telomere lengths and this mechanism seems predominant at the early stage of leukemogenesis. Also, telomerase and ALT might jointly act to maintain telomere lengths at the chronic phase, and as CML progresses, telomerase becomes the major mechanism. Finally, CML cells display an altered nuclear organization of their telomeres which is characterized by the presence of high number of telomeric aggregates, a feature of genomic instability, and differential positioning of telomeres. CML represents a good model to study mechanisms responsible for dynamic changes of individual telomere lengths and the remodeling of telomeric nuclear organization throughout cancer progression.",,,,PMC3795380,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this review, we concentrate on mechanisms leading to CIN in myeloid neoplasia, i.e., myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) or acute myeloid leukemia (AML). The pathogenesis of myeloid neoplasia is complex and involves genetic and epigenetic alterations. Chromosome aberrations define specific subgroups and guide clinical decisions. Genomic instability may play an essential role in leukemogenesis by promoting the accumulation of genetic lesions responsible for clonal evolution. Indeed, disease progression is often driven by clonal evolution into complex karyotypes. Earlier studies have shown an association between telomere shortening and advanced MDS and underlined the important role of dysfunctional telomeres in the development of genetic instability and cancer. Several studies link chromosome rearrangements and aberrant DNA and histone methylation. Genes implicated in epigenetic control, like DNMT3A, ASXL1, EZH2 and TET2, have been discovered to be mutated in MDS. Moreover, gene-specific hypermethylation correlates highly significantly with the risk score according to the International Prognostic Scoring System. In AML, methylation profiling also revealed clustering dependent on the genetic status. Clearly, genetic instability and clonal evolution are driving forces for leukemic transformation. Understanding the mechanisms inducing CIN will be important for prevention and for novel approaches towards therapeutic interventions.",,,,PMC3795368,,,,,,,,,,,,

Besides P-TEFb, several proteins have been identified as HEXIM1 binding proteins. It is noteworthy that more than half of the HEXIM1 binding partners are involved in cancers. P53 and two key regulators of the p53 pathway, nucleophosmin (NPM) and human double minute-2 protein (HDM2), are among the factors identified. This review will focus on the functional importance of the interactions between HEXIM1 and p53/NPM/HDM2. NPM and the cytoplasmic mutant of NPM, NPMc+, were found to regulate P-TEFb activity and RNA polymerase II transcription through the interaction with HEXIM1. Importantly, more than one-third of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients carry NPMc+, suggesting the involvement of HEXIM1 in tumorigenesis of AML. HDM2 was found to ubiquitinate HEXIM1. The HDM2-mediated ubiquitination of HEXIM1 did not lead to protein degradation of HEXIM1 but enhanced its inhibitory activity on P-TEFb. Recently, HEXIM1 was identified as a novel positive regulator of p53. HEXIM1 prevented p53 ubiquitination by competing with HDM2 in binding to p53. Taken together, the new evidence suggests a role of HEXIM1 in regulating the p53 pathway and tumorigenesis.",,,,PMC3795367,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here we evaluated two different RRVs derived from amphotropic murine leukemia virus (AMLV) and gibbon ape leukemia virus (GALV), in human malignant mesothelioma cells. In vitro, both RRVs expressing the green fluorescent protein gene efficiently replicated in most mesothelioma cell lines tested, but not in normal mesothelial cells. Notably, in ACC-MESO-1 mesothelioma cells that were not permissive for AMLV-RRV, the GALV-RRV could spread efficiently in culture and in mice with subcutaneous xenografts by in vivo fluorescence imaging. Next, GALV-RRV expressing the cytosine deaminase prodrug activator gene showed efficient killing of ACC-MESO-1 cells in a prodrug 5-fluorocytosine dose-dependent manner, compared with AMLV-RRV. GALV-RRV-mediated prodrug activator gene therapy achieved significant inhibition of subcutaneous ACC-MESO-1 tumor growth in nude mice. Quantitative reverse transcription PCR demonstrated that ACC-MESO-1 cells express higher PiT-1 (GALV receptor) and lower PiT-2 (AMLV receptor) compared with normal mesothelial cells and other mesothelioma cells, presumably accounting for the distinctive finding that GALV-RRV replicates much more robustly than AMLV-RRV in these cells.

However, the molecular mechanisms that underlie the ligand-independent apoptosis, including the activity of AR in testicular stem cells, are not completely understood. In the present study, we generated induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from bovine testicular cells by electroporation of octamer-binding transcription factor 4 (OCT4). The cells were supplemented with leukemia inhibitory factor and bone morphogenetic protein 4, which maintained and stabilized the expression of stemness genes and pluripotency. The iPSCs were used to assess the apoptosis activity following exposure to phthalate esters, including di (2-ethyhexyl) phthalates, di (n-butyl) phthalate, and butyl benzyl phthalate. Phthalate esters significantly reduced the expression of AR in iPSCs and induced a higher ratio of BAX/BCL-2, thereby favoring apoptosis. Phthalate esters also increased the expression of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1 (p21(Cip1)) in a p53-dependent manner and enhanced the transcriptional activity of p53. The forced expression of AR and knockdown of p21(Cip1) led to the rescue of the phthalate-mediated apoptosis. Overall, this study suggests that testicular iPSCs are a useful system for screening the toxicity of environmental disruptors and examining their effect on the maintenance of stemness and pluripotency, as well as for identifying the iPSC signaling pathway(s) that are deregulated by these chemicals.",,,,PMC3847308,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we investigated its anti-leukaemia effects using acute promyelocytic leukaemia (APL) as a model. METHODS: Cytotoxic effects of Pho-s on leukaemia cells were evaluated by MTT assay. Leukaemic cells obtained from hCG-PML-RARa transgenic mice were transplanted to NOD/SCID mice. After the animals were diagnosed as leukaemic, treatment started with Pho-s using all-trans retinoid acid or daunorubicin as positive control or and saline control. Cell morphology and immunophenotyping were used to detect the undifferentiated blast cells in the spleen, liver and bone marrow. The induction of apoptosis in vitro and in malignant leukaemic clones was evaluated. RESULTS: Synthetic phosphoethanolamine is cytotoxic and induces apoptosis through the mitochondrial pathway in vitro to leukaemia cell lines. In vivo Pho-s exhibits anti-proliferative effects in APL model reducing the number of CD117(+) and Gr-1(+) immature myeloid cells in the BM, spleen and liver. Synthetic phosphoethanolamine impairs the expansion of malignant clones CD34(+)/CD117(+), CD34(+) and Gr-1(+) in the BM. In addition, Pho-s induces apoptosis of immature cells in the spleen and liver, a notable effect. CONCLUSION: Synthetic phosphoethanolamine has anti-leukaemic effects in an APL model by inhibiting malignant clone expansion, suggesting that it is an interesting compound for leukaemia treatment.",,,,PMC3844899,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is a potent inhibitor of the FMS-like kinase 3 (FLT3) but shows in vitro activity in a wide range of AML samples. In the present study, we have characterized the effects of AKN-028 on AML cells in more detail. AKN-028 induced a dose-dependent G0/1 arrest in AML cell line MV4-11. Treatment with AKN-028 caused significantly altered gene expression in all AML cell types tested (430 downregulated, 280 upregulated transcripts). Subsequent gene set enrichment analysis revealed enrichment of genes associated with the proto-oncogene and cell cycle regulator c-Myc among the downregulated genes in both AKN-028 and midostaurin treated cells. Kinase activity profiling in AML cell lines and primary AML samples showed that tyrosine kinase activity, but not serine/threonine kinase activity, was inhibited by AKN-028 in a dose dependent manner in all samples tested, reaching approximately the same level of kinase activity. Cells sensitive to AKN-028 showed a higher overall tyrosine kinase activity than more resistant ones, whereas serine/threonine kinase activity was similar for all primary AML samples. In summary, AKN-028 induces cell cycle arrest in AML cells, downregulates Myc-associated genes and affect several signaling pathways. AML cells with high global tyrosine kinase activity seem to be more sensitive to the cytotoxic effect of AKN-028 in vitro.",['Copyright (c) 2013 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

Here, we investigated the specific targeting and dynamics of histone H3 variants in human primary senescent cells.

Instead, we observe that new H3.3 colocalizes with its specific histone chaperones within the promyelocytic leukemia nuclear bodies (PML-NBs) and is targeted to PML-NBs in a DAXX-dependent manner both in proliferating and senescent cells. We further show that overexpression of DAXX enhances targeting of H3.3 in large PML-NBs devoid of transcriptional activity and promotes the accumulation of HP1, independently of H3K9me3. Loss of H3.3 from pericentromeric heterochromatin upon DAXX or PML depletion suggests that the targeting of H3.3 to PML-NBs is implicated in pericentromeric heterochromatin organization. Together, our results underline the importance of the replication-independent chromatin assembly pathway for histone replacement in non-dividing senescent cells and establish PML-NBs as important regulatory sites for the incorporation of new H3.3 into chromatin.",,['NOTNLM'],"['DAXX', 'H3.3', 'PML-NBs', 'chromatin dynamics', 'senescence']",PMC3906242,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here we provide evidence that such restrictions can be exploited as specific antiblastic targets by physiological factors such as pyruvate, tetrahydrofolate, and glutamine. These metabolites act as powerful cytotoxic agents on cancer stem cells (CSCs) when supplied at doses that perturb the biochemical network, sustaining the resumption of aerobic growth after the hypoxic dormant state. Experiments were performed in vivo and in vitro using CSCs obtained from various anaplastic tumors: human melanoma, leukemia, and rat hepatoma cells. Pretreatment of melanoma CSCs with pyruvate significantly reduces their self-renewal in vitro and tumorigenicity in vivo. The metabolic network underlying the cytotoxic effect of the physiological factors was thoroughly defined, principally using AH130 hepatoma, a tumor spontaneously reprogrammed to the embryonic stem stage. This network, based on a tight integration of aerobic glycolysis, cellular redox state, and folate metabolism, is centered on the cellular NADP/NADPH ratio that controls the redox pathway of folate utilization in purine synthesis. On the whole, this study indicates that pyruvate, FH 4, and glutamine display anticancer activity, because CSCs are committed to survive and maintain their stemness in hypoxia. When CSC need to differentiate and proliferate, they shift from anaerobic to aerobic status, and the few mitochondria available makes them susceptible to the injury of the above physiological factors. This vulnerability might be exploited for novel therapeutic treatments.",,['NOTNLM'],"['Krebs cycle substrates', 'cancer stem cells', 'cellular redox-state', 'folate metabolism', 'hypoxia']",PMC3906243,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is frequently misregulated in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL), often due to deletions between TAL1 and the neighboring STIL gene. To better understand the events that lead to TAL1 expression in hematopoiesis and in T-ALL, we studied looping interactions at the TAL1 locus. In TAL1-expressing erythroid cells, the locus adopts a looping ""hub"" which brings into close physical proximity all known TAL1 cis-regulatory elements including CTCF-bound insulators. Loss of GATA1 results in disassembly of the hub and loss of CTCF/RAD21 from one of its insulators. Genes flanking TAL1 are partly dependent on hub integrity for their transcriptional regulation. We identified looping patterns unique to TAL1-expressing T-ALL cells, and, intriguingly, loops occurring between the TAL1 and STIL genes at the common TAL1/STIL breakpoints found in T-ALL. These findings redefine how TAL1 and neighboring genes communicate within the nucleus, and indicate that looping facilitates both normal and aberrant TAL1 expression and may predispose to structural rearrangements in T-ALL. We also propose that GATA1-dependent looping mechanisms may facilitate the conservation of TAL1 regulation despite cis-regulatory remodeling during vertebrate evolution.",,,,,,,"['BBS/B/08043/Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council/United Kingdom', 'G0400180/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom']",,,,,,,,,

More than 100 of these genes are previously unrecognized and highly erythroid specific. By integrating genome-wide surveys of chromatin states, transcription factor occupancy, and tissue expression patterns, we identify multiple lncRNAs that are dynamically expressed during erythropoiesis, show epigenetic regulation, and are targeted by key erythroid transcription factors GATA1, TAL1, or KLF1.

Depleting them severely impaired erythrocyte maturation, inhibiting cell size reduction and subsequent enucleation. One of them, alncRNA-EC7, is transcribed from an enhancer and is specifically needed for activation of the neighboring gene encoding BAND 3.

Previous genome-wide association studies have reported several ARID5B and IKZF1 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with the incidence of ALL. High-resolution melting (HRM) analysis is a rapid and convenient technique to detect SNPs; we thereby detected SNPs in ARID5B and IKZF1 genes. METHODS: We enrolled 79 pediatric ALL patients and 80 healthy controls. Polymorphic variants of IKZF1 (rs6964823, rs4132601, and rs6944602) and ARID5B (rs7073837, rs10740055, and rs7089424) were detected by HRM, and SNPs were analyzed for association with childhood ALL. RESULTS: The distribution of genotype rs7073837 in ARID5B significantly differed between ALL and controls (P=0.046), while those of IKZF1 (rs6964823, rs4132601, and rs6944602) and ARID5B (rs10740055 and rs7089424) did not. We analyzed the association for SNPs with B lineage ALL to find rs7073837 in ARID5B, conferring a higher risk for B lineage ALL (odds ratio, OR=1.70, 95% confidence interval, CI=1.01-2.87, P=0.049). CONCLUSION: HRM is a practical method to detect SNPs in ARID5B and IKZF1 genes.

NK-cell differentiation is accompanied by an increased surface expression of inhibitory killer immunoglobulin-like receptor (KIR) molecules, which is positively associated with cytotoxicity against the HLA-deficient K562 cell line. NK-cells are rapidly redeployed between the blood and tissues in response to acute exercise, but it is not known if exercise evokes a preferential trafficking of differentiated NK-cells or impacts NK-cell cytotoxic activity (NKCA) against HLA-expressing target cells. Sixteen healthy cyclists performed three 30-min bouts of cycling exercise at -5%, +5%, and +15% of lactate threshold. Blood samples obtained before, immediately after, and 1h after exercise were used to enumerate NK-cells and their subsets, and determine NKCA and degranulating subsets (CD107+) against cell lines of multiple myeloma (U266 and RPMI-8226), lymphoma (721.221 and 221 AEH), and leukemia (K562) origin by 4 and 10-color flow cytometry, respectively. Exercise evoked a stepwise redeployment of NK-cell subsets in accordance with differentiation status [highly-differentiated (KIR+/NKG2A-) >medium-differentiated (KIR+/NKG2A+)>low-differentiated (KIR-/NKG2A+)] that was consistent across all exercise intensities. NKCA per cell increased approximately 1.6-fold against U266 and 221 AEH targets 1h post-exercise and was associated with a decreased proportion of NK-cells expressing the inhibitory receptor CD158b and increased proportion of NK-cells expressing the activating receptor NKG2C, respectively. We conclude that exercise evokes a preferential redeployment of NK-cell subsets with a high differentiation phenotype and augments cytotoxicity against HLA-expressing target cells. Exercise may serve as a simple strategy to enrich the blood compartment of highly cytotoxic NK-cell subsets that can be harvested for clinical use.",['Copyright (c) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

In the present study, we showed, using an in vitro model of lung tumorigenesis, that dimethylamino-parthenolide (DMAPT), a water soluble parthenolide analog, selectively inhibited the growth and survival of premalignant and malignant cells with minimal effects on parental immortalized cells. These effects were paralleled by suppression of pSTAT3, Mcl-1 and cyclin D1 and PARP cleavage, suggesting that the antiproliferative and apoptotic effects of DMAPT could be mediated, at least in part, via suppression of the STAT3 signaling pathway. Moreover, in tobacco smoke carcinogen-induced lung tumor bioassay in mice, intranasal instillation of low doses of DMAPT significantly reduced the overall lung tumor multiplicity by 39%. Interestingly, the drug was specifically effective (62% reduction) against bigger lung tumors (> 2 mm), which have a higher potential to develop into lung adenocarcinoma. Western immunoblotting analyses of mouse lung tissues indicated significantly lower level of pSTAT3 and Mcl-1 in the carcinogen plus DMAPT group relative to the group treated with the carcinogen only. Given the evidence that STAT3 is activated in more than half of lung cancers and it regulates genes involved in cell proliferation, survival and angiogenesis, DMAPT is a promising agent for lung cancer chemoprevention in subjects who are at high risk of developing this devastating disease.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

All of the younger children reported that physicians consistently directed medication education to parents only, and that the younger children were rarely present during these sessions. 13 of the 16 children stated that they want to learn more about and be more involved in education sessions addressing their medications. CONCLUSIONS: Children with ALL at the IWK Health Centre do not have a good knowledge of their medications, however most children expressed that they want to know more about their medications.",,['NOTNLM'],"['Adolescent', 'Canada', 'Child', 'Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice', 'Health Literacy', 'Neoplasms']",PMC3818736,,,,,,,,,,,,

Substantial progress on understanding the cell hierarchy within ALL bone marrow (BM) has been recorded in the last few years, suggesting that both primitive cell fractions and committed lymphoid blasts with immature stem cell-like properties contain leukemia-initiating cells. Nevertheless, the biology of the early progenitors that initiate the lymphoid program remains elusive. The aim of the present study was to investigate the ability of lymphoid progenitors from B-cell precursor ALL BM to proliferate and undergo multilineage differentiation. By phenotype analyses, in vitro proliferation assays, and controlled culture systems, the lymphoid differentiation potentials were evaluated in BM primitive populations from B-cell precursor ALL pediatric patients. When compared to their normal counterparts, functional stem and progenitor cell contents were substantially reduced in ALL BM. Moreover, neither B nor NK or dendritic lymphoid-cell populations developed recurrently from highly purified ALL-lymphoid progenitors, and their proliferation and cell cycle status revealed limited proliferative capacity. Interestingly, a number of quiescence-associated transcription factors were elevated, including the transcriptional repressor Gfi-1, which was highly expressed in primitive CD34(+) cells. Together, our findings reveal major functional defects in the primitive hematopoietic component of ALL BM. A possible contribution of high levels of Gfi-1 expression in the regulation of the stem/progenitor cell biology is suggested.",,,,PMC3808104,,,,,,,,,,,,

The envelope-mediated immunosuppression was assessed by the ability of the proteins, when expressed by allogeneic tumor cells normally rejected by engrafted mice, to allow these cells to escape, at least transiently, immune rejection. Using this approach, we identified key residues whose mutation (i) specifically abolishes immunosuppressive activity without affecting the ""mechanical"" function of the envelope protein and (ii) significantly enhances humoral and cellular immune responses elicited against the virus. The objective of this work was to study the immunosuppressive activity of the envelope protein (p15E) of feline leukemia virus (FeLV) and evaluate the effect of its abolition on the efficacy of a vaccine against FeLV. Here we demonstrate that the FeLV envelope protein is immunosuppressive in vivo and that this immunosuppressive activity can be ""switched off"" by targeted mutation of a specific amino acid. As a result of the introduction of the mutated envelope sequence into a previously well characterized canarypox virus-vectored vaccine (ALVAC-FeLV), the frequency of vaccine-induced FeLV-specific gamma interferon (IFN-gamma)-producing cells was increased, whereas conversely, the frequency of vaccine-induced FeLV-specific interleukin-10 (IL-10)-producing cells was reduced. This shift in the IFN-gamma/IL-10 response was associated with a higher efficacy of ALVAC-FeLV against FeLV infection. This study demonstrates that FeLV p15E is immunosuppressive in vivo, that the immunosuppressive domain of p15E can modulate the FeLV-specific immune response, and that the efficacy of FeLV vaccines can be enhanced by inhibiting the immunosuppressive activity of the IS domain through an appropriate mutation.",,,,PMC3911645,,,,,,,,,,,,

Specifically, the promyelocytic leukemia protein (TRIM19; also called PML) is a viral restriction factor inhibiting processes from uncoating to transcription to cell survival. Here we investigated PML's effect on adeno-associated virus (AAV), a parvovirus used for gene delivery. Although dependovirus (AAV) and autonomous parvovirus (minute virus of mice) replication centers can colocalize with PML, PML's functional effect on parvoviruses is unknown. Using PML knockout mice, we determined that PML knockout enhances recombinant AAV2 (rAAV2) transduction at a range of vector doses in both male and female mice. In fact, male and female PML knockout mice exhibited up to 56-fold and 28-fold increases in transduction, respectively. PML inhibited several rAAV serotypes, suggesting a conserved mechanism, and organ specificity correlated with PML expression. Mechanistically, PML inhibited rAAV second-strand DNA synthesis, precluding inhibition of self-complementary rAAV, and did not affect the prior steps in transduction. Furthermore, we confirmed the effect of human PML on rAAV transduction through small interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated knockdown in HuH7 cells and determined that the highest level of inhibition was due to effects of PML isoform II (PMLII). Overexpression of PMLII resulted in inhibition of second-strand synthesis, vector production, and genome replication. Moreover, wild-type AAV2 production and infectivity were also inhibited by PMLII, demonstrating a PML interaction with wild-type AAV. These data have important implications for AAV-mediated gene therapy. Additionally, PMLII inhibition of AAV second-strand synthesis and replication, which are processes necessary for all parvoviruses, suggests implications for replication of other parvoviruses.",,,,PMC3911643,,,"['R01 DK084033/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AI072176/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 AI007419/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'U54 AR056953/AR/NIAMS NIH HHS/United States', '1R01AI080726/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', '5T32-AI007419/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', '5U54AR056953/AR/NIAMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AR064369/AR/NIAMS NIH HHS/United States', '1R01AR064369/AR/NIAMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AI080726/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 HL112761/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', '5R01AI072176/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', '5R01DK084033/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', '1P01HL112761/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,

We analysed implementation, safety and efficacy of a standard operating procedure for oral, azole-based, mould-active antifungal prophylaxis. METHODS: Patients with AML and RALs aged >/=13 years received 200 mg of posaconazole three times daily and patients aged 2-12 years received 200 mg of voriconazole two times daily from the completion of chemotherapy until haematopoietic recovery. Algorithms for fever or focal findings in all patients with haematological malignancies included blood cultures, high-resolution CT and other appropriate imaging, serial serum galactomannan, invasive diagnostics and pre-emptive therapy with change in class if on antifungal medication. RESULTS: From 2006 to 2010, 40 patients (0.8-17 years; 21 males) with newly diagnosed AML (n = 31) or RAL (n = 9) were admitted, of whom 36 received a total of 149 courses of chemotherapy (reasons for exclusion: contraindications and early death </=3 days). Azole prophylaxis was given in 87.2% (n = 130/149) of episodes. Pre-emptive antifungal therapy for pulmonary infiltrates was initiated in 5/36 (13.9%) patients or 6/130 (4.6%) episodes for a duration of 3-22 days. No proven or probable IFIs occurred. Adverse events (AEs) were common but mostly low grade and reversible. Three courses (2.3%) were discontinued due to AEs. In simultaneously admitted new patients with acute lymphatic leukaemia (ALL; n = 101) and paediatric lymphomas (n = 29) not receiving standard antifungal prophylaxis, proven/probable IFIs occurred in 4 patients with ALL (4.0%) and 7/130 patients (5.4%) received pre-emptive therapy. CONCLUSIONS: Azole-based, mould-active antifungal prophylaxis in high-risk paediatric patients with AML and RALs was satisfactorily implemented, well tolerated and effective.

Epub 2013 Nov 7.,,"PURPOSE: Epidemiological studies have found an association between exposure to extremely low-frequency magnetic fields (ELF-MF) and childhood leukemia. In 2005, a large British study showed an association between proximity of residence to high-voltage power lines and the risk of childhood leukemia. The association extended beyond distances at which the 'power line'-induced magnetic fields exceed background levels, suggesting that the association was not explained by the magnetic field, but might be due to chance, bias, or other risk factors associated with proximity to power lines. Our aim was to conduct a comparable study in an independent setting (Denmark). METHODS: We included 1,698 cases aged <15, diagnosed with leukemia during 1968-2006, from the Danish Cancer Registry and 3,396 controls randomly selected from the Danish childhood population and individually matched by gender and year of birth. We used geographical information systems to determine the distance between residence at birth and the nearest 132-400 kV overhead power line. RESULTS: Odds ratios (ORs) were 0.76 [95 % confidence interval (CI) 0.40-1.45] for children who lived 0-199 m from the nearest power line and 0.92 (95 % CI 0.67-1.25) for those who lived 200-599 m away when compared with children who lived >/=600 m away. When restricting the analysis to 220 and 400 kV overhead power lines, the OR for children who lived 200-599 m from a power line was 1.76 (95 % CI 0.82-3.77) compared to children who lived >/=600 m away. However, chance is a likely explanation for this finding as the result was not significant, numbers were small, and there were no indications of an higher risk closer to the lines since no cases were observed within 200 m of these. CONCLUSIONS: We found no higher risk of leukemia for children living 0-199 m or for children living 200-599 m of a 132-400 kV overhead power line. A slightly elevated OR for children living between 200 and 599 m of a 220-400 kV overhead power line is likely to be a chance finding.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The construct included the high-affinity CD16 (FCGR3A) V158 variant, CD8alpha hinge, and transmembrane domains, along with signaling domains from CD3zeta and 4-1BB (TNFRSF9), forming a chimeric receptor termed CD16V-BB-zeta. After retrovirus-mediated expression in human T cells, CD16V-BB-zeta bound humanized antibodies with higher affinity than a control receptor containing the more common F158 variant. Engagement of CD16V-BB-zeta provoked T-cell activation, exocytosis of lytic granules, and sustained proliferation, with a mean cell recovery after 4-week coculture with Daudi lymphoma cells and rituximab of nearly 70-fold relative to input cells. In contrast, unbound antibody alone produced no effect. CD16V-BB-zeta T cells specifically killed lymphoma cells and primary chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells in combination with rituximab at a low effector:target ratio, even when assayed on mesenchymal cells. Trastuzumab triggered CD16V-BB-zeta-mediated killing of HER2 (ERBB2)(+) breast and gastric cancer cells; similar results were obtained with an anti-GD2 antibody in neuroblastoma and osteosarcoma cells. Furthermore, coadministration of CD16V-BB-zeta T cells with immunotherapeutic antibodies exerted considerable antitumor activity in vivo. Signaling mediated by 4-1BB-CD3zeta induced higher T-cell activation, proliferation, and cytotoxicity than CD3zeta or FcepsilonRIgamma, and the receptor was expressed effectively after mRNA electroporation without viral vectors, facilitating clinical translation. Our results offer preclinical proof of concept for CD16V-BB-zeta as a universal, next-generation chimeric receptor with the potential to augment the efficacy of antibody therapies for cancer.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This phenomenon was explored by applying gene expression profiling to the lungs of mice with these metastases. Consequently, erythroid differentiation regulator 1 (Erdr1) was identified as upregulated in the WT mice. Though commonly associated with bone marrow stroma, Erdr1 was differentially expressed in WT pulmonary mesenchymal cells (PMC) and murine embryonic fibroblasts (MEF). Moreover, the Ccr5 ligand Ccl4 increased its expression by 3.36 +/- 0.14-fold. Ccr5 signaling was dependent on the mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (Map2k) but not the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (Pi3k) pathway because treatment with U0126 inhibited upregulation of Erdr1, but treatment with LY294002 increased the expression by 3.44 +/- 0.92-fold (P < 0.05). The effect Erdr1 on B16-F10 melanoma metastasis was verified by the adoptive transfer of WT MEFs into Ccr5(-/-) mice. In this model, MEFs that had been transduced with Erdr1 short hairpin RNA (shRNA) lowered metastasis by 33% compared with control transduced MEFs. The relevance of ERDR1 on human disease was assessed by coculturing chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) cells with M2-10B4 stromal cells that had been transfected with shRNA or control plasmids. After 96 hours of coculture, the cell counts were higher with control cell lines than with Erdr1 knockdown lines [odds ratio (OR), 1.88 +/- 0.27, 2.52 +/- 0.66, respectively]. This increase was associated with a decrease in apoptotic cells (OR, 0.69 +/- 0.18, 0.58 +/- 0.12, respectively).

GABAergic neurons are produced in all of the main domains of the CNS, where they develop from discrete regions of the neuroepithelium. Here, we review the gene expression and regulatory mechanisms controlling the main steps of GABAergic neuron development: early patterning of the proliferative neuroepithelium, production of postmitotic neural precursors, establishment of their identity and migration. By comparing the molecular regulation of these events across CNS, we broadly identify three regions utilizing distinct molecular toolkits for GABAergic fate determination: telencephalon-anterior diencephalon (DLX2 type), posterior diencephalon-midbrain (GATA2 type) and hindbrain-spinal cord (PTF1A and TAL1 types).

To elucidate ATL pathogenesis in vivo, a variety of animal models have been established; however, the mechanisms driving this disorder remain poorly understood due to deficiencies in each of these animal models. Here, we report a novel HTLV-1-infected humanized mouse model generated by intra-bone marrow injection of human CD133(+) stem cells into NOD/Shi-scid/IL-2Rgammac null (NOG) mice (IBMI-huNOG mice). Upon infection, the number of CD4(+) human T cells in the periphery increased rapidly, and atypical lymphocytes with lobulated nuclei resembling ATL-specific flower cells were observed 4 to 5 months after infection. Proliferation was seen in both CD25(-) and CD25(+) CD4 T cells with identical proviral integration sites; however, a limited number of CD25(+)-infected T-cell clones eventually dominated, indicating an association between clonal selection of infected T cells and expression of CD25. Additionally, HTLV-1-specific adaptive immune responses were induced in infected mice and might be involved in the control of HTLV-1-infected cells. Thus, the HTLV-1-infected IBMI-huNOG mouse model successfully recapitulated the development of ATL and may serve as an important tool for investigating in vivo mechanisms of ATL leukemogenesis and evaluating anti-ATL drug and vaccine candidates.",,,,,,,,,,['Blood. 2014 Jan 16;123(3):303-4.

METHODS: We linked data on all children born in Britain between 1992 and 2008 after assisted conception without donor involvement with data from the United Kingdom National Registry of Childhood Tumours to determine the number of children in whom cancer developed before 15 years of age. Cohort cancer rates were compared with population-based rates in Britain over the same period, with stratification for potential mediating and moderating factors, including sex, age at diagnosis, birth weight, singleton versus multiple birth, parity, parental age, type of assisted conception, and cause of parental infertility. RESULTS: The cohort consisted of 106,013 children born after assisted conception (700,705 person-years of observation). The average duration of follow-up was 6.6 years. Overall, 108 cancers were identified, as compared with 109.7 expected cancers (standardized incidence ratio, 0.98; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.81 to 1.19; P=0.87). Assisted conception was not associated with an increased risk of leukemia, neuroblastoma, retinoblastoma, central nervous system tumors, or renal or germ-cell tumors. It was associated with an increased risk of hepatoblastoma (standardized incidence ratio, 3.64; 95% CI, 1.34 to 7.93; P=0.02; absolute excess risk, 6.21 cases per 1 million person-years) and rhabdomyosarcoma (standardized incidence ratio, 2.62; 95% CI, 1.26 to 4.82; P=0.02; absolute excess risk, 8.82 cases per 1 million person-years), with hepatoblastoma developing in 6 children and rhabdomyosarcoma in 10 children. The excess risk of hepatoblastoma was associated with low birth weight. CONCLUSIONS: There was no increase in the overall risk of cancer among British children born after assisted conception during the 17-year study period. Increased risks of hepatoblastoma and rhabdomyosarcoma were detected, but the absolute risks were small.

The aim of this study was to examine the relationship between MTX elimination and renal function to identify parameters that may be useful for predicting delayed MTX elimination in Chinese children with ALL and NHL. A total of 105 children with ALL and NHL were included in the study. Each patient received HDMTX (3 or 5 g/m2) over 24 hours. Plasma MTX concentrations were measured at 24, 48, and 96 hours. Delayed elimination was indicated by plasma MTX concentrations >/=1.0 at 48 hours or >/=0.1 mumol/L at 96 hours. Creatinine clearance rate (CCr) and serum Cr concentrations were measured at 0, 24, and 48 hours. There were 39 patients (37.1%) with delayed MTX elimination. For patients with delayed MTX elimination, the 24 hour plasma MTX concentration was negatively correlated with the 24 hour CCr (P=0.019). The 48 hour plasma MTX concentration was positively correlated with 24 and 48 hour serum Cr concentrations (P=0.001 and P<0.001, respectively), and negatively correlated with the 24 and 48 CCr (both P<0.001). Both MTX concentrations and elimination time decreased with increasing CCr (P<0.05 and P<0.001, respectively). Receiver operating characteristic curves revealed that the best predictors of delayed MTX elimination were 24 hour CCr 36 mmol/L (sensitivity: 64.7%; specificity: 77.4%) (both P < 0.001). CCr and serum Cr concentration may be useful for monitoring plasma MTX concentrations in children receiving HDMTX for ALL and NHL and for predicting delayed MTX elimination.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In present study, a new strain ITBHU02, isolated from soil site near degrading hospital waste, was investigated for the production of extracellular L-asparaginase. Further, it was renamed as Bacillus aryabhattai ITBHU02 based on its phenotypical features, biochemical characteristics, fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) profile and phylogenetic similarity of 16S rDNA sequences. The strain was found protease-deficient and its optimal growth occurred at 37 degrees C and pH 7.5. The strain was capable of producing enzyme L-asparaginase with maximum specific activity of 3.02 +/- 0.3 Umg(-1) protein, when grown in un-optimized medium composition and physical parameters. In order to improve the production of L-asparaginase by the isolate, response surface methodology (RSM) and genetic algorithm (GA) based techniques were implemented. The data achieved through the statistical design matrix were used for regression analysis and analysis of variance studies. Furthermore, GA was implemented utilizing polynomial regression equation as a fitness function. Maximum average L-asparaginase productivity of 6.35 Umg(-1) was found at GA optimized concentrations of 4.07, 0.82, 4.91, and 5.2 gL(-1) for KH2PO4, MgSO4 x 7H2O, L-asparagine, and glucose respectively.

RESULTS: Of a total 185 patients with ovarian cancer, 76 received UM-FU. Thirty-five patients had measurable disease. Fifteen (42%) showed objective response lasting three to 95 months, with decrease in size of masses and disappearance of ascites or hydrothorax. Their survival from diagnosis to death was 41 months. Twenty patients showed no response; their mean survival was 18 months. Three of the 76 patients who received UM-FU developed acute nonlymphocytic leukemia. CONCLUSION: UM-FU was effective in controlling ascites and hydrothorax and diminished intraabdominal masses.

Moreover, we found reactivity of a panel of CLL recombinant antibodies (CLL-rAbs) encoded by a germ-line allele with a single CMV protein, pUL32, despite differing antibody binding motifs. To put these findings into perspective, we studied prospectively relative frequency of viremia, kinetics of total and virus-specific IgG over time, and UL32 genetic variation in a cohort of therapy-naive patients (n=200). CMV-DNA was detected in 3% (6/200) of patients. The decay of total IgG was uniform (mean, 0.03; SD, 0.03) and correlated with that of IgG subclasses 1-4 in the paired samples available (n=64; p<0.001). Total CMV-specific IgG kinetics were more variable (mean, 0,02; SD, 0,06) and mean decay values differed significantly from those of total IgG (p=0.034). Boosts of CMV-specific antibody levels were observed in 49% (22/45) of CMV-seropositive patients. In contrast, VZV- and EBV-specific IgG levels decayed in parallel with total IgG levels (p=0.003 and p=0.001, respectively). VZV-specific IgG even became undetectable in 18% (9/50) of patients whereas CMV-specific ones remained detectable in all seropositive patients. The observed CMV-specific IgG kinetics were predicated upon the highly divergent kinetics of IgG specific for individual antigens - glycoprotein B-specific IgG were boosted in 51% and pUL32-specific IgG in 32% of patients. In conclusion, CLL patients have a preserved CMV-specific antibody response despite progressive decay of total IgG and IgG subclasses. CMV-specific IgG levels are frequently boosted in contrast to that of other herpesviruses indicative of a higher rate of CMV reactivation and antigen-presentation. In contrast to the reactivity of multiple different CLL-rAbs with pUL32, boosts of humoral immunity are triggered apparently by other CMV antigens than pUL32, like glycoprotein B.",,,,PMC3806856,,,,,,,,,,,,

The capacity of these phospholipases to digest membranes of stimulated or apoptotic cells correlates to the exposure of phosphatidylserine. In the present study, the ability of the phosphatidyl-L-serine-binding protein, lactadherin to inhibit phospholipase enzyme activity has been assessed. Inhibition of human secretory phospholipase A2-V on phospholipid vesicles exceeded 90%, whereas inhibition of Naja mossambica sPLA2 plateaued at 50-60%.

They are typically considered neoplasms because of frequent genetic aberrations and patient-limited survival with progression to acute myeloid leukemia (AML) or death related to the consequences of bone marrow failure including infection, hemorrhage, and iron overload. A progression to AML has always been recognized among the myeloproliferative disorders (MPD) but occurs only rarely among those with essential thrombocythemia (ET). Yet, the World Health Organization (WHO) has chosen to apply the designation myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN), for all MPD but has not similarly recommended that all MDS become the myelodysplastic neoplasms (MDN). This apparent dichotomy may reflect the extremely diverse nature of MDS. Moreover, the term MDS is occasionally inappropriately applied to hematologic disorders associated with acquired morphologic myelodysplastic features which may rather represent potentially reversible hematological responses to immune-mediated factors, nutritional deficiency states, and disordered myelopoietic responses to various pharmaceutical, herbal, or other potentially myelotoxic compounds. We emphasize the clinical settings, and the histopathologic features, of such AMD that should trigger a search for a reversible underlying condition that may be nonneoplastic and not MDS.",,,,PMC3806348,,,,,,,,,,,,

Consequently, increasing cell homing is currently studied as a strategy to improve cell therapy. Cell rolling on the vascular endothelium is an important step in the process of cell homing and can be probed in-vitro using a parallel plate flow chamber (PPFC). However, this is an extremely tedious, low throughput assay, with poorly controlled flow conditions. Instead, we used a multi-well plate microfluidic system that enables study of cellular rolling properties in a higher throughput under precisely controlled, physiologically relevant shear flow. In this paper, we show how the rolling properties of HL-60 (human promyelocytic leukemia) cells on P- and E-selectin-coated surfaces as well as on cell monolayer-coated surfaces can be readily examined. To better simulate inflammatory conditions, the microfluidic channel surface was coated with endothelial cells (ECs), which were then activated with tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), significantly increasing interactions with HL-60 cells under dynamic conditions. The enhanced throughput and integrated multi-parameter software analysis platform, that permits rapid analysis of parameters such as rolling velocities and rolling path, are important advantages for assessing cell rolling properties in-vitro. Allowing rapid and accurate analysis of engineering approaches designed to impact cell rolling and homing, this platform may help advance exogenous cell-based therapy.",,,,PMC3892982,,,"['R01 HL095722/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL095722/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",['NIHMS548191'],,,,,,,,

We determined the expression levels of genes involved in AZA metabolism: UCK1, UCK2, DCK, hENT1, RRM1 and RRM2 using quantitative PCR in samples from 57 patients with MDS who received AZA. Lower expression of UCK1 was seen in patients without a response to AZA (median 0.2 vs 0.49 for patients with response to AZA, P=0.07). This difference in UCK1 expression was not influenced by aberrant methylation of the UCK1 promoter. In addition, the seven polymorphic loci found in the coding sequence were not associated with UCK1 gene expression nor AZA response. Silencing of UCK1 by siRNA leads to blunted response to AZA in vitro. The univariate analysis revealed that patients expressing lower than median levels of UCK1 had a shorter overall survival (P=0.049). Our results suggest that expression level of UCK1 is correlated with clinical outcome and may influence the clinical response to AZA treatment in patients with MDS.",,,,PMC3948159,,,,,,,,,,,,

Therefore, there is a significant interest in discovering its function in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). Firstly, OAZ1 mRNA was measured by qRT-PCR in 43 cases with CML and 23 controls, and we demonstrated that it is significantly down-regulated in CML patients. To further understand its functions in CML pathogenesis, OAZ1 was overexpressed, and the human leukemia PCR array analysis was used to monitor the expression of key genes commonly involved in leukemia development, classification and therapeutic response. We found several favorable up-regulation factors including CXCL10, DAPK1 and IKZF3. In conclusion, OAZ1 may be a useful therapeutic target in CML due to its potential ability to induce erythroid differentiation and cell apoptosis. These functions were proven to be associated with several gene changes that were directly or indirectly caused by OAZ1. The mechanism of how OAZ1 affects other genes remains to be elucidated.","['(c) 2013 S. Karger AG, Basel.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Associations were considered significant when there were at least two independently significant SIRs or a statistically significant trend of increasing SIRs with increasing number of melanomas in relatives. The applied criteria for significant associations were convincingly met by pancreatic, breast, prostate, and squamous cell skin tumors and ependymoma, although there was significant but not overwhelming evidence for thyroid, parathyroid, lung, and unknown primary tumors, meningioma, mycosis fungoides, and myeloid leukemia. To our knowledge, no studies have previously considered a detailed family history of melanoma and the use of internal validation to assess familial associations of melanoma with other tumors.

This process is essential for vertebrate development and plays a key role in human diseases. Angiogenesis is generally understood to be essential for the growth and metastasis of solid tumors and is also important in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). METHODS: This review summarizes the essential features of physiological and tumoral angiogenesis and the methods used for their assessment. RESULTS: Technologies for evaluating angiogenesis in AML are discussed and the prognostic significance of angiogenic factors is considered in the context of optimizing treatment. CONCLUSION: As acute myelogenous leukemia and endothelial cells depend on each other for survival and proliferation, therapy directed against several pro-angiogenic factors might help to enhance the AML outcome.",,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute leukemia', 'Angiogenesis', 'Diagnosis', 'Prognosis']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Cell viability was determined by MTT assay. Apoptosis induction was analyzed using Annexin V/propidium iodide staining. Erythroid differentiation was assessed by the expression level of CD235a, a marker for detection of the erythroid cell lineage. The activation of p38 MAPK and the expression profile of apoptosis-related proteins Bcl-2 and Bid were analyzed using western blot. RESULTS: As2S2 inhibited cell growth of these cell lines. Of note, the IC50 value of As2S2 in MDS-L cells was comparable to that in F-36p cells, and was half of that in HL-60 cells. A dose-dependent decrease in cell viability and concomitant increase in the percentage of apoptotic cells were observed in F-36p cells treated with 8 and 16 microM As2S2 for 72 hours. However, similar phenomena were only observed in HL-60 cells when treated with as high as 16 microM As2S2. Furthermore, As2S2 exerted more potent erythroid differentiation-inducing activity on F-36p cells than HL-60 cells. Interestingly, negative correlation between p38 MAPK signaling pathway and As2S2-induced erythroid differentiation was observed in HL-60 cells. Treatment with relatively high concentration of As2S2 resulted in the downregulation of Bcl-2 and Bid proteins in HL-60 cells. DISCUSSION: These results suggest that compared to AML cell line, MDS and MDS/AML cell lines are more sensitive to not only the erythroid differentiation-inducing activity of As2S2, but also its cytotoxicity associated with apoptosis induction. These findings further provide novel insight into As2S2 action toward its use for clinical application in patients with hematological disorders.",,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute myeloid leukemia', 'Apoptosis', 'Arsenic disulfide', 'Erythroid differentiation', 'Myelodysplastic syndromes']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

RESULTS: Compounds 1, 2 and 3 showed significant antimicrobial activity against two Gram-positive bacteria and one fungus (with MICs varying between 3.12 and 6.25 microg/ml). The four compounds exhibited remarkable antiproliferative activity against the leukemia cell line TPH-1 with IC(5)(0) inhibition values between 2 and 2.1 microg/ml. Cytotoxic activity was found to be related to apoptosis induction. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that natural compounds herein studied are interesting potential candidates for the development of new therapeutic agents, especially against leukemia and Gram-positive bacterial infections.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS AND RESULTS: Here we investigated the role of IGFBP2 in in human leukemia cells and in the retroviral AML1-ETO9a transplantation acute myeloid leukemia (AML) mouse model. RESULTS: IGFBP2 is highly expressed in certain human AML and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) cells. Inhibition of expression of endogenous IGFBP2 in human leukemia cells led to elevated apoptosis and decreased migration and, consistently, to decreased activation of AKT and other signaling molecules. We also studied the effects of IGFBP2 knockout in the retroviral AML1-ETO9a transplantation AML mouse model. The deletion of IGFBP2 in donor AML cells significantly decreased leukemia development in transplanted mice. Lack of IGFBP2 resulted in upregulation of PTEN expression and downregulation of AKT activation, in the mouse AML cells. The treatment of IGFBP2 deficient AML cells with a PTEN inhibitor restored the wild-type colony forming ability. The deletion of IGFBP2 also led to decreased AML infiltration into peripheral organs and tissues, suggesting that IGFBP2 is required for the migration of AML cells out of bone marrow.

Our previous study found that miR-99a was up-regulated in pediatric primary AML using microRNA expression profiles. Up to date, although there is a certain number of reports on microRNA expression features and functions in pediatric acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), the expression and function of miR-99a in these diseases remain to be investigated. METHODS: qRT-PCR was performed to measure the expression level of miR-99a in 88 samples including 68 pediatric acute myeloid leukemia patients, 8 chronic myeloid leukemia patients and 12 pediatric controls. MTT assay, apoptosis assay, dual-luciferase reporter transfection assay and western blot analysis were used to investigate the function of miR-99a. RESULTS: MiR-99a was highly expressed in pediatric-onset AML (M1-M5) and CML, while significantly lowly expressed during complete remission of these diseases. MTT assay indicated that the proliferations of K562 and HL60 cells were significantly promoted by miR-99a, and apoptosis assessment by Annexin V/propidium iodide staining demonstrated that the apoptosis of these cells was inhibited by miR-99a. Additionally, dual-luciferase reporter transfection assay and western blot analysis indicated that miR-99a may target CTDSPL and TRIB2, which are two tumor suppressor genes. CONCLUSIONS: This study revealed that miR-99a may play a potential oncogenic role in pediatric myeloid leukemia including AML and CML via regulating tumor suppressors CTDSPL and TRIB2, suggesting that these two leukemias might share some common biological pathways involved in the generation and development of disease and miR-99a could be a common therapeutic target for myeloid leukemias treatment.",,,,PMC4176743,,,,,,,,,,,,

Free radicals of arylamine xenobiotics and drugs did not react with oxygen in peroxidase-catalyzed reactions; however, they showed marked oxygen uptake in the presence of an aminocarboxylate. These free-radical intermediates were identified using the spin trap 5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline-N-oxide (DMPO) and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectrometry. Diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (DTPA), a polyaminocarboxylate, caused a concentration-dependent attenuation of N-centered radicals produced by the peroxidative metabolism of arylamines with the subsequent formation of secondary aliphatic carbon-centered radicals stemming from the cosubstrate molecule. Analogously, N,N-dimethylglycine (DMG) and N-methyliminodiacetate (MIDA), but not iminodiacetic acid (IDA), demonstrated a similar scavenging effect of arylamine-derived free radicals in a horseradish peroxidase/H2O2 system. Using human promyelocytic leukemia (HL-60) cell lysate as a model of human neutrophils, DTPA, MIDA, and DMG readily reduced anilinium cation radicals derived from the arylamines and gave rise to the corresponding carbon radicals. The rate of peroxidase-triggered polymerization of aniline was studied as a measure of nitrogen-radical scavenging. Although, IDA had no effect on the rate of aniline polymerization, this was almost nullified in the presence of DTPA and MIDA at half of the molar concentration of the aniline substrate, whereas a 20 molar excess of DMPO caused only a partial inhibition. Furthermore, the yield of formaldehyde, a specific reaction endproduct of the oxidation of aminocarboxylates by aniline free-radical metabolites, was quantitatively determined. Azobenzene, a specific reaction product of peroxidase-catalyzed free-radical dimerization of aniline, was fully abrogated in the presence of DTPA, as confirmed by GC/MS. Under aerobic conditions, a radical-transfer reaction is proposed between aminocarboxylates and arylamine free radicals via the carboxylic group-linked tertiary nitrogen of the deprotonated amino acid derivatives. These findings may have significant implications for the biological fate of arylamine xenobiotic and drug free-radical metabolites.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To decipher the etiology of this disease, we identified the thrombopoietin (Tpo) gene as a target of the SMRT-retinoic acid receptor signaling pathway in bone marrow stromal cells. Chronic induction of Tpo in SMRT(mRID) mice results in up-regulation of TGF-beta and PDGF in megakaryocytes, uncontrolled proliferation of bone marrow reticular cells, and fibrosis of the marrow compartment. Of therapeutic relevance, we show that this syndrome can be rescued by retinoid antagonists, demonstrating that the physical interface between SMRT and retinoic acid receptor can be a potential therapeutic target to block primary myelofibrosis disease progression.",,['NOTNLM'],"['myelodysplastic syndrome', 'ostesclerosis', 'splenomegaly']",PMC3839709,,,"['P01 HL088093/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL105278/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL088093/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'DK090962/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA060553/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'Howard Hughes Medical Institute/United States', 'R01 AR046797/AR/NIAMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R37 DK057978/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'HL105278/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'DK057978/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'R24 DK090962/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,

PML-RARalpha is degraded by the proteasome by a SUMO-dependent, ubiquitin-mediated pathway in response to arsenic treatment, curing the disease. Six major PML isoforms are expressed as a result of alternative splicing, each of which encodes a unique C-terminal region. Using a system in which only a single EYFP-linked PML isoform is expressed, we demonstrate that PMLI, PMLII and PMLVI accumulate in the cytoplasm following arsenic treatment, whereas PMLIII, PMLIV and PMLV do not. 3D structured illumination was used to obtain super-resolution images of PML bodies, revealing spherical shells of PML along with associated SUMO. Arsenic treatment results in dramatic isoform-specific changes to PML body ultrastructure. After extended arsenic treatment most PML isoforms are degraded, leaving SUMO at the core of the nuclear bodies. A high-content imaging assay identifies PMLV as the isoform most readily degraded following arsenic treatment, and PMLIV as relatively resistant to degradation. Immunoprecipitation analysis demonstrates that all PML isoforms are modified by SUMO and ubiquitin after arsenic treatment, and by using siRNA, we demonstrate that arsenic-induced degradation of all PML isoforms is dependent on the ubiquitin E3 ligase RNF4. Intriguingly, depletion of RNF4 results in marked accumulation of PMLV, suggesting that this isoform is an optimal substrate for RNF4.

The mechanism by which cells acquire the ability for increased enzyme expression, however, has not been clearly defined. Evidence presented here indicates that genomic alterations in the form of translocations, gene amplification, or increased P-glycoprotein expression, do not account for the phenotypic transformation fromL-asparaginase sensitivity toL-asparaginase resistance. Instead, both sensitive and resistant L5178Y cells contain immunoreactive material detected by Western blotting with an antiserum prepared against bovine pancreatic asparagine synthetase.

Circadian genes and their protein products constitute the molecular components of the circadian oscillator that form positive/negative feedback loops and generate circadian rhythms. The circadian regulation extends from core clock genes to various clock-controlled genes that include various cell cycle genes. Aberrant expression of circadian clock genes, therefore, may lead to genomic instability and accelerated cellular proliferation potentially promoting carcinogenesis. The current study encompasses the investigation of simultaneous expression of four circadian clock genes (Bmal1, Clock, Per1 and Per2) and three clock-controlled cell cycle genes (Myc, Cyclin D1 and Wee1) at mRNA level and determination of serum melatonin levels in peripheral blood samples of 37 CLL (chronic lymphocytic leukemia) patients and equal number of age- and sex-matched healthy controls in order to indicate association between deregulated circadian clock and manifestation of CLL. Results showed significantly down-regulated expression of Bmal1, Per1, Per2 and Wee1 and significantly up-regulated expression of Myc and Cyclin D1 (P < 0.0001) in CLL patients as compared to healthy controls. When expression of these genes was compared between shift-workers and non-shift-workers within the CLL group, the expression was found more aberrant in shift-workers as compared to non-shift-workers. However, this difference was found statistically significant for Myc and Cyclin D1 only (P < 0.05). Serum melatonin levels were found significantly low (P < 0.0001) in CLL subjects as compared to healthy controls whereas melatonin levels were found still lower in shift-workers as compared to non-shift-workers within CLL group (P < 0.01). Our results suggest that aberrant expression of circadian clock genes can lead to aberrant expression of their downstream targets that are involved in cell proliferation and apoptosis and hence may result in manifestation of CLL. Moreover, shift-work and low melatonin levels may also contribute in etiology of CLL by further perturbing of circadian clock.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Survivors of childhood ALL treated at St Jude Children's Research Hospital who were still alive at 10 or more years after diagnosis and were age >/= 18 years were recruited for neurocognitive testing. In all, 1,014 survivors were eligible, 738 (72.8%) agreed to participate, and 567 (76.8%) of these were evaluated. Mean age was 33 years; mean time since diagnosis was 26 years. Medical record abstraction was performed for data on doses of cranial radiation therapy (CRT) and cumulative chemotherapy. Multivariable modeling was conducted and glmulti package was used to select the best model with minimum Akaike information criterion. RESULTS: Impairment rates across neurocognitive domains ranged from 28.6% to 58.9%, and those treated with chemotherapy only demonstrated increased impairment in all domains (all P values < .006). In survivors who received no CRT, dexamethasone was associated with impaired attention (relative risk [RR], 2.12; 95% CI, 1.11 to 4.03) and executive function (RR, 2.42; 95% CI, 1.20 to 4.91). The impact of CRT was dependent on young age at diagnosis for intelligence, academic, and memory functions. Risk for executive function problems increased with survival time in a CRT dose-dependent fashion. In all survivors, self-reported behavior problems increased by 5% (RR, 1.05; 95% CI, 1.01 to 1.09) with each year from diagnosis. Impairment was associated with reduced educational attainment and unemployment. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates persistent and significant neurocognitive impairment in adult survivors of childhood ALL and warrants ongoing monitoring of brain health to facilitate successful adult development and to detect early onset of decline as survivors mature.",,,,PMC3842908,,,"['P30 CA021765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA21765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,

The molecular mechanisms underlying this compartment shift during leukemia evolution have not been a major focus of investigation and remain poorly understood. Here a mechanism underlying this shift was examined in the context of Runx1 deficiency, a frequent leukemia-initiating event. Lineage-negative cells isolated from the bone marrow of Runx1-haploinsufficient and wild-type control mice were cultured in granulocyte-colony-stimulating factor to force lineage commitment. Runx1-haploinsufficient cells demonstrated significantly greater and persistent exponential cell growth than wild-type controls. Not surprisingly, the Runx1-haploinsufficient cells were differentiation-impaired, by morphology and by flow-cytometric evaluation for granulocyte differentiation markers. Interestingly, however, this impaired differentiation was not because of decreased granulocyte lineage commitment, as RNA and protein upregulation of the master granulocyte lineage-commitment transcription factor Cebpa, and Hoxb4 repression, was similar in wild-type and Runx1-haploinsufficient cells. Instead, RNA and protein expression of Cebpe, a key driver of progressive maturation after lineage commitment, were significantly decreased in Runx1-haploinsufficient cells. Primary acute myeloid leukemia cells with normal cytogenetics and RUNX1 mutation also demonstrated this phenotype of very high CEBPA mRNA expression but paradoxically low expression of CEBPE, a CEBPA target gene. Chromatin-immunoprecipitation analyses suggested a molecular mechanism for this phenotype: in wild-type cells, Runx1 binding was substantially greater at the Cebpe than at the Cebpa enhancer. Furthermore, Runx1 deficiency substantially diminished high-level Runx1 binding at the Cebpe enhancer, but lower-level binding at the Cebpa enhancer was relatively preserved. Thus, Runx1-deficiency permits Cebpa upregulation and the exponential cell growth that accompanies lineage commitment, but by impairing activation of Cebpe, a key proliferation-terminating maturation gene, extends this exponential growth. These mechanisms facilitate germline cell or HSC of origin, yet evolution into LIC with lineage-committed phenotype.",,,,PMC3849692,,,"['R01 CA138858/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'UL1 RR024989/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,

We have developed UW-OncoPlex, a clinical molecular diagnostic assay to provide simultaneous deep-sequencing information, based on >500x average coverage, for all classes of mutations in 194 clinically relevant genes. To validate UW-OncoPlex, we tested 98 previously characterized clinical tumor specimens from 10 different cancer types, including 41 formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue samples. Mixing studies indicated reliable mutation detection in samples with >/= 10% tumor cells. In clinical samples with >/= 10% tumor cells, UW-OncoPlex correctly identified 129 of 130 known mutations [sensitivity 99.2%, (95% CI, 95.8%-99.9%)], including single nucleotide variants, small insertions and deletions, internal tandem duplications, gene copy number gains and amplifications, gene copy losses, chromosomal gains and losses, and actionable genomic rearrangements, including ALK-EML4, ROS1, PML-RARA, and BCR-ABL. In the same samples, the assay also identified actionable point mutations in genes not previously analyzed and novel gene rearrangements of MLL and GRIK4 in melanoma, and of ASXL1, PIK3R1, and SGCZ in acute myeloid leukemia. To best guide existing and emerging treatment regimens and facilitate integration of genomic testing with patient care, we developed a framework for data analysis, decision support, and reporting clinically actionable results.","['Copyright (c) 2014 American Society for Investigative Pathology and the', 'Association for Molecular Pathology.

Recent studies indicated that MRTF-A might be an important regulator of mammary gland and be involved in cancer metastasis. However, the roles of histone modification in the MRTF-A-dependent signal pathway and tumor migration are still not very clear. Here, we report that histone methylation is required for the MRTF-A-mediated upregulation of myosin regulatory light chain 9 (MYL9), an important cytoskeletal component which is implicated in cell migration. Furthermore, we demonstrate that SET and MYND domain containing protein 3 (SMYD3), a hitone methyltransferase (HMT) associated with carcinogenesis, might be the one which is responsible for the histone methylation occurred in the MRTF-A-mediated- transactivation of MYL9 and migration of breast cancer cells. Overexpression of SMYD3 promotes MRTF-A-mediated upregulation of MYL9 and migration of MCF-7 breast cancer cells, while contrary results were observed when the endogenous MRTF-A and SMYD3 were suppressed with specific siRNAs. In addition, the mutation analysis suggested that this cooperative transactivation is mainly mediated via the proximal binding element of MRTF-A in the promoter of MYL9, and the HMT activity of SMYD3 is required as well. Our findings reveal a new mechanism by which MRTF-A and SMYD3 functions in transcriptional regulation and cell migration, and provide a better understanding for metastasis of breast cancer.",['Copyright (c) 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

MATERIAL AND METHODS: In a prospective study, 3 Tesla MRI was performed in 19 febrile neutropenic patients (5 women, 14 men; mean age 61 years +/- 14.2; range 23-77 years). All patients underwent high-resolution CT less than 24h prior to MRI. The MRI protocol (Magnetom Tim Trio, Siemens) included a T2-weighted HASTE sequence (TE/TR: 49 ms/infinity, slice thickness 6mm) and a high-resolution 3D VIBE sequence with an ultra-short TE<1 ms (TE/TR 0.8/2.9 ms, slice thickness 2mm). The VIBE sequence was examined before and after intravenous injection of 0.1 mmol/kg gadoterate meglumine (Dotarem, Guerbet). The presence of pulmonary abnormalities, their location within the lung, and lesion type (nodules, consolidations, glass opacity areas) were analyzed by one reader and compared to the findings of HRCT, which was evaluated by a second independent radiologist who served as the reference standard. The findings were compared per lobe in each patient and rated as true positive (TP) findings if all three characteristics (presence, location, and lesion type) listed above were concordant to HRCT. RESULTS: Pulmonary abnormalities were characterized by 3 Tesla MRI with a sensitivity of 82.3% and a specificity of 78.6%, resulting in an overall accuracy of 88% (NPV/PPV 66.7%/89.5%). In 51 lobes (19 of 19 patients), pulmonary abnormalities visualized by MR were judged to be concordant in their location and in the lesion type identified by both readers. In 22 lobes (11 of 19 patients), no abnormalities were present on either MR or HRCT (true negative). In 6 lobes (5 of 19 patients), ground glass opacity areas were detected on MRI but were not visible on HRCT (false positives). In 11 lobes (7 of 19 patients), MRI failed to detect ground glass opacity areas identified by HRCT. However, since the abnormalities were disseminated in these patients, accurate treatment decisions were possible in every case based on MRI. In one case MRI showed a central area of cavitation, which was not visualized by HRCT. CONCLUSION: Infectious nodules and consolidations can be detected in neutropenic patients with acute myeloid leukemia with a sufficient diagnostic accuracy by 3 Tesla MRI. Detection of ground glass opacity areas is the main limitation of 3-Tesla MRI when compared to HRCT.",['Copyright (c) 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Previous studies demonstrated that CD34(-) severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID)-repopulating cells (SRCs) are a distinct class of primitive HSCs in comparison to the well-characterized CD34(+)CD38(-) SRCs. However, the purification level of rare CD34(-) SRCs in 18 lineage marker-negative (Lin(-)) CD34(-) cells (1/1000) is still very low compared with that of CD34(+)CD38(-) SRCs (1/40). As in the mouse, it will be necessary to identify useful positive markers for a high degree of purification of rare human CD34(-) SRCs. Using 18Lin(-)CD34(-) cells, we analyzed the expression of candidate positive markers by flow cytometric analysis. We finally identified CD133 as a reliable positive marker of human CB-derived CD34(-) SRCs and succeeded in highly purifying primitive human CD34(-) HSCs. The limiting dilution analysis demonstrated that the incidence of CD34(-) SRCs in 18Lin(-)CD34(-)CD133(+) cells was 1/142, which is the highest level of purification of these unique CD34(-) HSCs to date. Furthermore, CD133 expression clearly segregated the SRC activities of 18Lin(-)CD34(-) cells, as well as 18Lin(-)CD34(+) cells, in their positive fractions, indicating its functional significance as a common cell surface maker to isolate effectively both CD34(+) and CD34(-) SRCs.",,,,PMC4051213,,,,,,,,,,,,

The absence of SPARC resulted in defective collagen assembly, with uneven compartmentalization of lymphoid and myeloid populations within secondary lymphoid organs (SLO), and faulty delivery of inhibitory signals from the extracellular matrix. These conditions promoted aberrant interactions between neutrophil extracellular traps and CD5(+) B cells, which underwent malignant transformation due to defective apoptosis under the pressure of neutrophil-derived trophic factors and NF-kappaB activation. Furthermore, this model of defective stromal remodeling during lymphomagenesis correlates with human lymphomas arising in a SPARC-defective environment, which is prototypical of CD5(+) B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL).",,,,,,,['11-0595/Worldwide Cancer Research/United Kingdom'],,,['Nat Rev Cancer. 2014 Jan;14(1):10-1.

RhoH remains in a constitutively active state and thus its effects are regulated by expression levels or post-translational modifications. Similar to other small GTPases, intracellular localization of RhoH is dependent upon the conserved ""CAAX"" box and surrounding sequences within the carboxyl (C) terminus. However, RhoH also contains a unique C-terminal ""insert"" domain of yet undetermined function. RhoH serves as adaptor molecule in T cell receptor signaling and RhoH expression correlates with the unfavorable prognostic marker ZAP70 in human chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Disease progression is attenuated in a Rhoh(-/-) mouse model of chronic lymphocytic leukemia and treatment of primary human chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells with Lenalidomide results in reduced RhoH protein levels. Thus, RhoH is a potential therapeutic target in B cell malignancies. In the current studies, we demonstrate that deletion of the insert domain (LFSINE) results in significant cytoplasmic protein accumulation. Using inhibitors of degradation pathways, we show that LFSINE regulates lysosomal RhoH uptake and degradation via chaperone-mediated autophagy. Whereas the C-terminal prenylation site is critical for ZAP70 interaction, subcellular localization and rescue of the Rhoh(-/-) T cell defect in vivo, the insert domain appears dispensable for these functions.

Moreover, JQ1 attenuated the Tax-mediated transcriptional activation of NF-kappaB, triggering the polyubiquitination and proteasome-mediated degradation of constitutively active nuclear RelA.

METHODS: NOD/Shi-scid, IL-2Rgamma(null) (NOG) mice were used as recipients of tumor cells from a patient with ATL, which engraft and proliferate in a microenvironment-dependent manner. The ATL cells could be serially transplanted in NOG mice, but could not be maintained in in vitro cultures. RESULTS: Injection of bevacizumab alone significantly increased necrosis and decreased vascularization in the tumor tissue. Levels of human soluble interleukin two receptor in the serum (reflecting the ATL tumor burden) of bevacizumab-treated mice were significantly lower than in untreated mice. Although bevacizumab monotherapy showed these clear anti-angiogenesis effects, it did not prolong survival. In contrast, injection of bevacizumab together with cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, prednisolone (CHOP) led to a significant prolongation of survival of the ATL mice relative to CHOP alone. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first report to evaluate the efficacy of bevacizumab for ATL in a tumor microenvironment-dependent model. Bevacizumab therapy combined with chemotherapy could be a valuable treatment strategy for that subgroup of ATL probably depending to a large extent on angiogenesis via vascular endothelial growth factor.",['(c) 2013 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

There is a need to search for alternative anti-leukemia therapies. Persea americana Mill var. Hass (Lauraceae) is a tropical fruit (avocado) that might be used against cancer. Objective: To investigate whether P. americana induces death in Jurkat lymphoblastic leukemia cells. Materials and methods: Four ethanol extracts (0.1, 0.5, 1, 2 and 5 mg/mL) from avocado fruit (endocarp, whole seed, seed and leaves) were analyzed against Jurkat cells. Hydrogen peroxide generation by oxidation of 2',7'-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate to the fluorescent compound 2',7'-dichlorfluorescein assay, acridine orange/ethidium bromide staining, flow cytometry analysis of annexin-V/7-amino-actinomycin, mitochondrial membrane potential and immunocytochemistry detection of transcription factor p53, caspase-3 and apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF) were evaluated. Results: Endocarp, seed, whole seed, and leaf (0.1 mg/mL) extracts induced significant apoptosis in Jurkat cells (p < 0.001) in an oxidative stress-dependent fashion via mitochondrial membrane depolarization (52-87%), activation of transcription factor p53 (6.3-25.4%), protease caspase-3 (8.3-20%) and predominance of AIF reactivity (20.6-36%) in all extracts. Similar results were obtained with 0.5 mg/mL extracts. However, extract >/=1 mg/mL concentration induced necrosis (100%). Conclusions: P. americana extracts function as a pro-apoptotic compound. Leukemic cells are eliminated through an oxidative stress mechanism. This study contributes to the understanding of the molecular mechanism of the avocado and its therapeutic action on leukemia.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although dasatinib is a potent, efficacious and generally well-tolerated drug, patients are also subject to various adverse effects. The most common pulmonary-related side effect is pleural effusion (PE). Renal failure has been reported rarely as a side effect of dasatinib treatment. We report the first case of a patient with imatinib-resistant CML who developed PE and acute renal failure (ARF) simultaneously, after being placed on dasatinib therapy. CASE SUMMARY: We report a 58-year-old female dasatinib-treated patient with Ph+ chronic phase CML who was admitted to our hospital due to persisted dyspnoea and fever. After reviewing the laboratory and clinical findings, we determined our patient as having simultaneously ARF and PE related to dasatinib therapy. Dasatinib was discontinued, and after 10 days of treatment with ampicillin-sulbactam, allopurinol, amlodipine, furosemide and methylprednisolone, she was discharged home effusion free and with ameliorated renal function. WHAT IS NEW AND CONCLUSION: PE is the most common extra-haematological toxicity observed during dasatinib treatment whose pathogenesis is still unclear. A possible role of cytokines, such as platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR)-beta and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), in causing endothelial permeability has been suggested. The aetiology of renal failure is also unclear in these patients, but two different possible mechanisms have been suggested such as tumour lysis syndrome and toxic tubular damage. In conclusion, here we describe the first case of simultaneous manifestation of PE and ARF associated with dasatinib. Thus, in patients treated with tyrosine kinase inhibitors, especially those with predisposing nephrological or haematological factors, serum creatinine levels should be monitored routinely.",['(c) 2013 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.'],['NOTNLM'],"['acute renal failure', 'adverse event', 'dasatinib', 'pleural effusion', 'simultaneous', 'tyrosine kinase inhibitor']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, a part of the mouse bladder tumour regrew due to regression after a period of time as the cancer stem cells could not be eliminated. In this study, we showed a modified method for the isolation of MB49 bladder cancer stem cells (MCSCs). METHODS: Through a comparison of different serum-free culture mediums (SFM), MCSCs were isolated by a combination of the limited dilution method and the optimal SFM method. The characterizations of MCSCs were verified by the fluorescence activated cell sorting, the quantitative polymerase chain reaction, the western blotting, the cell proliferation assay, the soft agar assay, the transwell assay, the resistance to chemotherapy assay and the tumor xenograft formation assay. RESULTS: The optimal SFM contained a RPMI1640+ epidermal growth factor (20 ng/ml), a basic fibroblast growth factor (20 ng/ml), a leukemia inhibitory factor (20 ng/ml), a B-27 serum-free supplement (20 mul/ml), and a bovine serum albumin (4 mug/ml). MCSCs possessed the high expression of cancer stem cell markers (CD133, CD44, OCT4, NANOG, and ABCG2) and the ability of differentiation. In functional comparisons, MCSCs had higher proliferative abilities, lower susceptibility to chemotherapy, greater migration in vitro, and stronger tumorigenic abilities in vivo. CONCLUSION: MCSCs displayed specific cancer stem cells properties. Our study showed MCSCs were isolated successfully with a modified method using a combination of limited dilution and SFM methods.",,,,PMC3840686,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study sought to determine frequencies of molecular monitoring and its impact on resource utilization and medical costs. METHODS: A retrospective US claims administrative database (IMS LifeLink Health Plan Claims and Truven Health Analytics MarketScan databases, 11/2007-06/2012) was used to analyze the economic impact of qPCR testing in CML patients on first-line TKIs during the initial 12-months of treatment. RESULTS: One thousand two hundred and five adult CML patients met the sample selection criteria. Among these, 41.0% had no qPCR tests, 31.9% had 1-2 tests, and 27.1% had 3-4 tests; 88.9% were initiated on imatinib; 47.7% were female. Patients in the 3-4 tests cohort incurred 44% (p < 0.001) fewer in-patient (IP) admissions than patients in the 0-tests cohort. Adjusted all-cause IP cost was $5663 (p = 0.005) lower for the 3-4 tests cohort than the 0-tests cohort. Adjusted progression-related IP cost was $4132 (p = 0.013) lower for the 3-4 tests cohort than the 0-tests cohort. Adjusted medical service cost was $5997 (p = 0.049) lower for the 3-4 tests cohort than the 0-tests cohort. LIMITATIONS: Claims databases did not include information on the primary cause of hospitalizations. CONCLUSIONS: Among CML patients in two large claims databases, nearly three-quarters did not receive adequate molecular monitoring per published guidelines. Those who were more frequently monitored incurred lower medical service costs, with the majority of the difference in costs being related to disease progression. These findings underscore the clinical and economic values of molecular monitoring in CML.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here we show that the Lmo2 aptamer PA207, either as a free peptide or fused to thioredoxin Trx-PA207, causes purified Lmo2 to precipitate rather than binding to a defined surface on the protein. Stabilisation of Lmo2 through interaction with LIM domain binding protein 1 (Ldb1), a normal binding partner of Lmo2, abrogates this effect. The addition of free zinc causes Trx-PA207 to self associate, suggesting that PA207 destabilises Lmo2 by modulating normal zinc-coordination in the LIM domains. GST-pulldown experiments with other Lmo and Gata proteins indicates that PA207 can bind to a range of zinc finger proteins. Thus, PA207 and other cysteine-containing peptide aptamers for Lmo2 may form a class of general zinc finger inhibitors.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A second case expressed CD2, CD13, and CD117 on both the Langerhans cells and the blasts suggesting a possible clonal relationship. All four cases exhibited geographic intermingling of the Langerhans cell histiocytosis and acute leukemia and shared unique features including extramedullary leukemia involving lymph nodes in all cases with Langerhans cell histiocytosis only present in sites involved by acute leukemia. T-cell antigen expression was present in all cases with one meeting criteria for mixed phenotype acute leukemia, T/myeloid, not otherwise specified.

In this study, we assessed the prognostic impact of bone marrow fibrosis in patients with primary myelodysplastic syndromes under the recently revised new risk stratification systems: the New Comprehensive Cytogenetic Scoring System and the Revised International Prognostic Scoring System. From 2002 to 2012, a total of 79 (13%) patients with primary myelodysplastic syndromes and moderate/severe bone marrow fibrosis were identified; and these patients were compared with a control group of 166 patients with myelodysplastic syndromes but no significant fibrosis. Bone marrow fibrosis predicted an inferior overall survival and leukemia event-free survival for patients who received no hematopoietic stem cell transplant in univariate and multivariate analysis. Eleven patients with bone marrow fibrosis and 32 control group patients underwent hematopoietic stem cell transplant; and bone marrow fibrosis was an independent risk for an inferior overall survival but not leukemia-free survival. In addition, 17 (4%) patients developed bone marrow fibrosis during the course of myelodysplastic syndromes, which was accompanied by clinical and cytogenetic evidence of disease progression. JAK2 V617F mutations were detected in 6 of the 28 patients with bone marrow fibrosis presenting at the time of diagnosis and 2 of the 7 patients with bone marrow fibrosis developing in the course of disease, significantly higher than the control group patients. We conclude that bone marrow fibrosis is an adverse risk feature in primary myelodysplastic syndromes in the current therapeutic era, and this risk feature is not captured by newly revised risk stratification systems. Inclusion of bone marrow fibrosis in patient assessment may further aid in risk-adapted therapeutic decisions.",,,,,,,['P30 CA016672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,

Recently, several human rhomboid genes have been associated with the development of chronic myeloid leukemia and pituitary, colorectal, ovarian, and breast cancers. In this study, we evaluated the mRNA and protein expression profiles of rhomboid genes in cancer cell lines and breast tissue/tumor samples. In silico analysis of publicly available gene expression datasets showed that different rhomboid genes are specifically expressed according to the breast cancer intrinsic subtypes. Quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis showed a significant RHBDD2 mRNA overexpression in advanced breast cancer compared with normal tissue samples (p = 0.012). In addition, we found that RHBDL2 and PARL mRNA expression was associated with a low/intermediate histologic tumor grade (p = 0.024 and p = 0.015, respectively). Immunohistochemistry analysis showed a significant increase of RHBDD2 protein expression in association with breast cancer samples negative for progesterone receptor (p = 0.015). Moreover, protein expression analysis corroborated the quantitative RT-PCR results, indicating that breast primary tumors belonging to patients with a more disseminated disease expressed significantly increased levels of RHBDD2 protein compared with less disseminated tumors (p = 0.01).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We reviewed outcomes of 168 consecutive patients (ages 0-30 years) with AML undergoing allo-HCT at our institution. Of these, 60% (n=101) were <15 years of age and 40% (n=67) were AYAs (15-30 years of age).

It was developed to act on up-regulated tyrosine kinases (TKs) like BCR-ABL in Philadelphia chromosome positive (Ph+) chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) when resistance to first- and second-generation TKIs developed. However, first- and second-generation TKIs show off-target effects on bone metabolism, whereas studies on skeletal adverse effects of bosutinib are still lacking. Therefore, it was the aim of this study to continuously expose juvenile rats to bosutinib and to analyze its influence on the growing bone. MATERIAL/METHODS: Starting after weaning, 4-week-old Wistar rats were chronically exposed over a 28-day period to varying concentrations of bosutinib, which were continuously administered subcutaneously via implanted Alzet(R) micro-osmotic pumps. After necropsy, the length of the femora and tibiae were analyzed. RESULTS: Continuous administration of bosutinib by micro-osmotic pumps led to serum drug levels in the lower therapeutic range, was well tolerated, and exhibited only minor adverse effects on the growing skeleton. CONCLUSIONS: Micro-osmotic pumps represent a convenient system for continuous TKI release in young growing rats. Compared to first- and second-generation TKIs, bosutinib seems to exert fewer adverse effects on the growing bone.",,,,PMC3852366,,,['I 734/Austrian Science Fund FWF/Austria'],,,,,,,,,

Azacitidine (AZA) has changed the outcome of patients with MDS or acute myeloid leukemia (AML) unfit for intensive chemotherapy. Identification of patients without the benefit of AZA would allow AZA combination or other drugs in first-line treatments. New whole-genome scanning technologies such as single nucleotide polymorphism microarray (SNP-A)-based molecular karyotyping (MK) improve the risk stratification in MDS and AML. Maintenance of genomic integrity is less than three megabases (Mbs) total disruption of the genome correlated with better overall survival (OS) in patients with lower-risk MDS. In this SNP-A study, we aimed at defining a cutoff value for total genomic copy number (CN) alterations (TGA) influencing the median OS in a cohort of 51 higher-risk MDS/AML patients treated with AZA. We observed that the relative risk of worse OS increased >100 Mb of TGA, as detected by SNP-A-based MK (8 and 15 months respectively, P=0.02).

In this study we demonstrate that in THP-1 human monocytic leukemia cells 87.4% of the 1034 most prominent genome-wide VDR binding sites co-localize with loci of open chromatin. At 165 of them 1alpha,25(OH)2D3 strongly increases chromatin accessibility and has at further 217 sites weaker effects. Interestingly, VDR binding sites in 1alpha,25(OH)2D3-responsive chromatin regions are far more often composed of direct repeats with 3 intervening nucleotides (DR3s) than those in ligand insensitive regions. DR3-containing VDR sites are enriched in the neighborhood of genes that are involved in controling cellular growth, while non-DR3 VDR binding is often found close to genes related to immunity. At the example of six early VDR target genes we show that the slope of their 1alpha,25(OH)2D3-induced transcription correlates with the basal chromatin accessibility of their major VDR binding regions. However, the chromatin loci controlling these genes are indistinguishable in their VDR association kinetics.

Viability assay on human myelomomonocytic cell line THP-1 and human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) using the Cell-Titer Blue assay proved that globularifolin had no toxic effect at the tested concentrations. Conversely, it is proportional to the dose globularifolin increased growth of THP-1 cells (p <0.01). On human PBMC, globularifolin at 6.25 and 12.5 muM concentrations showed a stimulatory effect, while at 12.5-200 muM it suppressed response of PBMC to stimulation with phytohemagglutinin (PHA). Globularifolin (50-200 muM) enhanced neopterin formation dose-dependently, whereas tryptophan breakdown was not influenced. At 50-200 muM in unstimulated PBMC in THP-1 cells, globularifolin induced a significant expression of nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) as was quantified by Quanti-Blue assay. By contrast, in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated cells, the higher concentrations of globularifolin suppressed NF-kappaB expression dose-dependently and a significant decrease was observed at 200 muM concentration. A positive correlation was found between increased neopterin and NF-kappaB activity (p <0.01). Similarly, a positive correlation was observed between neopterin levels in mitogen-induced cells and NF-kappaB activity in LPS-stimulated cells after treatment with globularifolin (p=0.001). The free radical scavenging capacity of globularifolin evaluated by Oxygen Radical Absorbance Capacity (ORAC) assay showed relative ORAC values of 0.36+/-0.05 mumol Trolox equivalent/mumol.

Here, we report that the small-molecule Smac mimetic BV6, which antagonizes Inhibitor of Apoptosis (IAP) proteins, acts in concert with cytarabine (AraC) to trigger cell death in AML cells in a highly synergistic manner (combination index 0.02-0.27). Similarly, BV6 cooperates with AraC to trigger cell death in primary AML samples, underscoring the clinical relevance of our findings. Molecular studies reveal that the TNFalpha-blocking antibody Enbrel significantly reduces BV6/AraC-induced cell death, demonstrating that an autocrine/paracrine TNFalpha loop mediates cell death. Furthermore, BV6 and AraC synergize to induce loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, caspase activation and DNA fragmentation, consistent with apoptotic cell death. Nevertheless, the caspase inhibitor zVAD.fmk fails to protect against BV6/AraC-induced cell death. Intriguingly, this cell death upon caspase inhibition is significantly reduced by pharmacological inhibition of two key components of necroptosis signaling, i.e. by RIP1 kinase inhibitor Necrostatin-1 or MLKL inhibitor NSA. Thus, BV6 sensitizes AML cells to AraC-induced cell death and overcomes apoptosis resistance by triggering necroptosis as alternative form of cell death. These findings have important implications for Smac mimetic-based strategies to bypass apoptosis resistance of AML.",['Copyright (c) 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

To explore the specific relationship between NPMc+ and FLT3/ITD in vivo, we crossed Flt3/ITD knock-in mice with transgenic NPMc+ mice. Mice with both mutations develop a transplantable leukemia of either myeloid or lymphoid lineage, definitively demonstrating cooperation between Flt3/ITD and NPMc+. In mice with myeloid leukemia, functionally significant loss of heterozygosity of the wild-type Flt3 allele is common, similar to what is observed in human FLT3/ITD+ AML, providing further in vivo evidence of the importance of loss of wild-type FLT3 in leukemic initiation and progression. Additionally, in vitro clonogenic assays reveal that the combination of Flt3/ITD and NPMc+ mutations causes a profound monocytic expansion, in excess of that seen with either mutation alone consistent with the predominance of myelomonocytic phenotype in human FLT3/ITD+/NPMc+ AML. This in vivo model of Flt3/ITD+/NPMc+ leukemia closely recapitulates human disease and will therefore serve as a tool for the investigation of the biology of this common disease entity.","['Copyright (c) 2014 ISEH - Society for Hematology and Stem Cells.

We analyzed 604 adults with acute myeloid leukemia in first complete remission (CR1) reported to the Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research who received a reduced-intensity or nonmyeloablative conditioning HCT from an HLA-identical sibling, HLA-matched unrelated donor, or umbilical cord blood donor from 2000 to 2010. We compared transplant outcomes based on exposure to cytarabine postremission consolidation. Three-year survival rates were 36% (95% confidence interval [CI], 29% to 43%) in the no consolidation arm and 42% (95% CI, 37% to 47%) in the cytarabine consolidation arm (P = .16). Disease-free survival was 34% (95% CI, 27% to 41%) and 41% (95% CI, 35% to 46%; P = .15), respectively. Three-year cumulative incidences of relapse were 37% (95% CI, 30% to 44%) and 38% (95% CI, 33% to 43%), respectively (P = .80). Multivariate regression confirmed no effect of consolidation on relapse, disease-free survival, and survival. Before reduced-intensity or nonmyeloablative conditioning HCT, these data suggest pre-HCT consolidation cytarabine does not significantly alter outcomes and support prompt transition to transplant as soon as morphologic CR1 is attained. If HCT is delayed while identifying a donor, our data suggest that consolidation does not increase transplant treatment-related mortality and is reasonable if required.","['Copyright (c) 2014 American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation.', 'Published by Elsevier Inc.

Our previous study has found that VEGF-C induces cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) expression in AML cell lines and significant correlation of VEGF-C and COX-2 in bone marrow specimens. COX-2 has been reported to mediate the proliferation and drug resistance in several solid tumors. Herein, we demonstrated that the VEGF-C-induced proliferation of AML cells is effectively abolished by the depletion or inhibition of COX-2. The expression of endothelin-1 (ET-1) rapidly increased following treatment with VEGF-C. We found that ET-1 was also involved in the VEGF-C-mediated proliferation of AML cells, and that recombinant ET-1 induced COX-2 mRNA and protein expressions in AML cells. Treatment with the endothelin receptor A (ETRA) antagonist, BQ 123, or ET-1 shRNAs inhibited VEGF-C-induced COX-2 expression. Flow cytometry and immunoblotting revealed that VEGF-C induces S phase accumulation through the inhibition of p27 and the upregulation of cyclin E and cyclin-dependent kinase-2 expressions. The cell-cycle-related effects of VEGF-C were reversed by the depletion of COX-2 or ET-1. The depletion of COX-2 or ET-1 also suppressed VEGF-C-induced increases in the bcl-2/bax ratio and chemoresistance against etoposide and cytosine arabinoside in AML cells. We also demonstrated VEGF-C/ET-1/COX-2 axis-mediated chemoresistance in an AML xenograft mouse model. Our findings suggest that VEGF-C induces COX-2-mediated resistance to chemotherapy through the induction of ET-1 expression. Acting as a key regulator in the VEGF-C/COX-2 axis, ET-1 represents a potential target for ameliorating resistance to chemotherapy in AML patients.",['(c) 2013.'],['NOTNLM'],"['AML', 'CDK', 'CKIs', 'COX', 'Chemoresistance', 'Cyclooxygenase-2', 'ET-1', 'ETRA', 'ETRB', 'Endothelin-1', 'VEGF-C', 'acute myeloid leukemia', 'cyclin-dependent kinase', 'cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors', 'cyclooxygenase', 'endothelin receptor A', 'endothelin receptor B', 'endothelin-1', 'vascular endothelial growth factor-C']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although one of the primary histologic features of TEN is keratinocyte apoptosis, its exact mechanism remains unknown. OBJECTIVES: We investigated the role of microRNAs (miRNAs) in the pathogenesis of severe drug eruptions and evaluated the possibility that miRNA can be a disease marker. METHODS: miRNAs were extracted from tissues and sera of patients. PCR array analyses were performed to identify pathogenic miRNAs. The results were confirmed with quantitative real-time PCR, in situ hybridization, transient transfection of small interfering RNAs or miRNA mimics into cultured keratinocytes, flow cytometry, immunoblotting, luciferase assay, and immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: PCR array analysis and real-time PCR using tissue miRNAs demonstrated that the miR-18a-5p level was increased in the skin of patients with TEN in vivo. Transfection of the miR-18a-5p mimic into keratinocytes in vitro resulted in increased apoptotic cell numbers and caspase-9 activity, which were also increased in the skin of patients with TEN. The miR-18a-5p mimic also downregulated the expression of B-cell lymphoma/leukemia-2-like protein 10 (BCL2L10), an anti-intrinsic apoptotic molecule. A luciferase assay with the BCL2L10 3' untranslated region showed BCL2L10 is directly targeted by miR-18a-5p. The protein and mRNA expressions of BCL2L10 were decreased in the skin of patients with TEN. Transfection with BCL2L10 small interfering RNA induced keratinocyte apoptosis and caspase activity. Furthermore, serum miR-18a-5p levels tended to be increased in patients with TEN and were correlated with areas of skin erythema or erosion in patients with drug eruptions. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicated that downregulated BCL2L10 caused by miR-18a-5p overexpression mediates intrinsic keratinocyte apoptosis in patients with TEN. Serum miR-18a-5p levels can be a useful disease marker for drug eruptions.","['Copyright (c) 2013 American Academy of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology. Published by', 'Mosby, Inc.

RESULTS: siRNA-coated chitosan nanosphere transfection led to 65%, Lipofectamine 2000 to 50% and adenovirus to 90% transfection efficiencies.

The nucleus accumbens (NAc) is essential to these drug-associated memories, but underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. Posttranslational chromatin modifications, such as histone methylation, modulate gene transcription; thus, we investigated the role of the associated epigenetic modifiers in METH-associated memory. METHODS: Conditioned place preference was used to assess the epigenetic landscape in the NAc supporting METH-associated memory (n = 79). The impact of histone methylation (H3K4me2/3) on the formation and expression of METH-associated memory was determined by focal, intra-NAc knockdown (KD) of a writer, the methyltransferase mixed-lineage leukemia 1 (Mll1) (n = 26), and an eraser, the histone lysine (K)-specific demethylase 5C (Kdm5c) (n = 38), of H3K4me2/3. RESULTS: A survey of chromatin modifications in the NAc of animals forming a METH-associated memory revealed the global induction of several modifications associated with active transcription. This correlated with a pattern of gene activation, as revealed by microarray analysis, including upregulation of oxytocin receptor (Oxtr) and FBJ osteosarcoma oncogene (Fos), the promoters of which also had increased H3K4me3. KD of Mll1 reduced H3K4me3, Fos and Oxtr levels and disrupted METH-associated memory. KD of Kdm5c resulted in hypermethylation of H3K4 and prevented the expression of METH-associated memory. CONCLUSIONS: The development and expression of METH-associated memory are supported by regulation of H3K4me2/3 levels by MLL1 and KDM5C, respectively, in the NAc. These data indicate that permissive histone methylation, and the associated epigenetic writers and erasers, represent potential targets for the treatment of substance abuse relapse, a psychiatric condition perpetuated by unwanted associative memories.","['(c) 2013 Society of Biological Psychiatry Published by Society of Biological', 'Psychiatry All rights reserved.']",['NOTNLM'],"['Demethylase', 'KDM5C', 'MLL', 'epigenetics', 'methyltransferase', 'nucleus accumbens']",PMC4024089,,,"['R00 DA024761/DA/NIDA NIH HHS/United States', 'DA033499/DA/NIDA NIH HHS/United States', 'DA034116/DA/NIDA NIH HHS/United States', 'K99 DA024761/DA/NIDA NIH HHS/United States', 'R03 DA033499/DA/NIDA NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 MH096847/MH/NIMH NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 DA034116/DA/NIDA NIH HHS/United States', 'DA024761/DA/NIDA NIH HHS/United States']",['NIHMS528001'],,,,,,,,

Inhibition of the BET proteins' chromatin interaction via specific bromodomain inhibitors blocks MLV virus replication at the integration step. MLV integration site distribution parallels the chromatin binding profile of BET proteins, and expression of an artificial fusion protein of the BET integrase binding domain with the chromatin interaction domain of the lentiviral targeting factor LEDGF/p75 retargets MLV integration away from transcription start sites and into the body of actively transcribed genes, conforming to the HIV integration pattern.

In naive animals allostatine demonstrated tumoristatic activity prevailing over alloferon-1 effect. The preventive vaccination caused only weak tumoristatic effect in 27% of vaccinated animals. The vaccination efficacy was dramatically enhanced by allostatine but not alloferon-1 administration: 65% of allostatine treated animals benefitted from tumoristatic effect and 30% was completely cured so that total number of positive responders grew to 95%. Thus, alloferon-1 and especially allostatine are worthy of further consideration as potential anti-cancer drugs. Allostatine seems to be particularly perspective for adjuvant cancer immunotherapy.

Expression of Tax overrode replicative senescence and promoted clonal expansion of the leukemic CD8+ T cells.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the QoL, symptom prevalence and symptom management among a sample of pediatric oncology patients. METHODS: The study design was cross-sectional. The Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory (PedsQL) cancer module and the Memorial Symptom Assessment Scale were administered in Arabic using face-to-face interviews to a convenience sample of 85 pediatric cancer patients (7-18 years) at a tertiary hospital in Lebanon. RESULTS: The mean age of the study group was 12.5 years with leukemia being the most common cancer (43.5%). The lowest scores on the PedsQL subscales were in nausea (score = 64.82; SD = 25.76) and worry (score = 68.14; SD = 30.07), thus indicating more problems in these areas. A comparison based on age showed significant differences in pain and hurt, nausea, and worry. In children (7-12 years), lack of appetite, pain, and nausea were mostly prevalent whereas adolescents (13-18 years) experienced lack of energy, irritability, and pain. In both age groups, pain and nausea were the most frequently treated symptoms. CONCLUSION: Overall, the participants had good health-related QoL as indicated by most of the PedsQL subscales. Symptom management was found to be inadequate and in some cases ineffective. More attention should be given to the management of symptoms in general using pharmacological and non-pharmacological techniques. Of particular importance is the importance of providing psychological support to alleviate symptom burden and improve QoL.",['Copyright (c) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Regardless of interesting pioneer works, little is known about Amaryllidaceae alkaloids that have shown promising anti-cancer activities. The crinane group of the Amaryllidaceae, including haemanthamine and haemanthidine, was amongst the first of these compounds to exhibit an interesting cytotoxic potential against cancer cell lines. However, the mechanism of cytotoxic and anti-proliferative activity is not yet entirely clear. The primary objectives of the current study were to investigate the effects of haemanthamine and haemanthidine on the induction of apoptosis and the cell cycle regulatory pathway in p53-null Jurkat cells. Results indicate that haemanthamine and haemanthidine treatment decreases cell viability and mitochondrial membrane potential, leads to a decline in the percentage of cells in the S phase of the cell cycle, induces apoptosis detected by Annexin V staining and increases caspase activity. Dose dependent apoptosis was cross verified by fluorescence and bright field microscopy through Annexin V/propidium iodine staining and morphological changes which characteristically attend programmed cell death. The apoptotic effect of haemanthamine and haemanthidine on leukemia cells is more pronounced than that of gamma radiation. Contrary to gamma radiation, Jurkat cells do not completely halt the cell cycle 24h upon haemanthamine and haemanthidine exposure. Both Amaryllidaceae alkaloids accumulate cells preferentially at G1 and G2 stages of the cell cycle with increased p16 expression and Chk1 Ser345 phosphorylation. Concerning the pro-apoptotic effect, haemanthidine was more active than haemanthamine in the Jurkat leukemia cell line.",['Copyright (c) 2013 Elsevier GmbH.

Mus dunni cells and mink lung cells are used to produce XMulV particles. In consideration of the characteristics of XMulV, we tried to propagate the viruses on CHO cells, a nonmurine cell line. METHODS: The viruses were harvested from CHO cells from Day 2 to Day 7 postinfection, and reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction was performed to quantify the viruses on different days. A cell-based infectivity assay was used to evaluate the XMulV titers. RESULTS: The content of the XMulV virions began to increase on Day 5 and grew exponentially from Day 6 to Day 7 postinfection. The growth curve was a typical single-step growth curve. Titers of the viral stock harvested on Day 7 were assayed on PG-4 cells, and the titers were 8.78 +/- 0.25 log10 PFU/mL. CONCLUSION: Based on these data, we conclude that CHO cells could be a host cell line for XMulV particles. XMulV produced on Day 7 in CHO cells could be used at a laboratory scale for the evaluation of XMulV clearance in pharmaceutical proteins derived from CHO cells.",['Copyright (c) 2013.

In this study we sought to investigate the association between pretransplantation serum albumin levels and prognosis among patients with leukemia who underwent allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (alloHSCT). METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed the data of 102 patients who underwent alloHSCT from 2004 to 2010. Pretransplant serum albumin, D-dimer, creatinine, and fibrinogen levels drawn within 10 days before transplantation were obtained from patient files. All parameters were divided into 2 groups: normal levels (group 1) versus abnormal levels (group 2). Our normal range of serum albumin is 3.2-5.2 g/dL; patients with pretransplantation albumin level >/=3.2 g/dL were included in group 1 versus group 2 with <3.2 g/dL. RESULTS: The patients included 42 (41.1%) female and 60 (58.9%) male patients. The diagnoses were acute myeloblastic leukemia in 65 (63.7%) and acute lymphoblastic leukemia in 37 (36.3%). The median age was 26.0 years (range, 13-57). Univariate and multivariate analysis showed that patients with serum albumin levels <3.2 g/dL experienced significantly lower overall survival (OS) compared with >/=3.2 g/dL (hazard ratio [HR] 2.32 [range, 1.23-4.54] and HR 2.70 [range 1.38-5.26], respectively; P = .009). The median (range) OS in group 2 was 230.0 (184.0-544.0) days versus 570.5 (249.5-1,101.0) days in group 1 (P = .007). For disease free survival (DFS) evaluation, univariate and multivariate analysis showed that patients with serum albumin levels <3.2 g/dL had significantly lower values compared with patients with serum albumin >/=3.2 g/dL. (HR 2.17 [range 0.98-4.76] and HR 2.85 [range, 1.25-6.66], respectively; P = .046). The median (range) DFS in group 2 was 184.0 (61.0-524.0) days versus 445.0 (199.0-917.5) days in group 1 (P = .045). Among the patient characteristics the presence of infection was a significant independent variable for worse OS (HR 2.12 [range, 0.98-4.36], P = .036). The other parameters-age, sex, donor status, time to transplant interval, conditioning regimens, HLA status, and number of total infused CD34(+) cells-showed no significant effect on OS and DFS (P = .05). CONCLUSIONS: Pretransplantation decreased serum albumin levels were associated with poor survival in patients with leukemia who underwent alloHSCT.",['Copyright (c) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

Clonal proliferation of B lymphocytes is seen in B-cell lymphoma/leukemia, and clonal plasma cell proliferation is seen in multiple myeloma and monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance. The monoclonal immunoglobulin in the setting of a B-cell or plasma cell disorder can cause a proliferative glomerulonephritis via 2 mechanisms: (1) glomerular deposition of the monoclonal immunoglobulin with activation of the classical pathway of complement (direct mechanism), resulting in an immunoglobulin-positive C3-positive glomerulonephritis, and (2) glomerular deposition of complement factors of the alternative and terminal pathway via inhibition of alternative pathway-regulating proteins by the monoclonal immunoglobulin (indirect mechanism), resulting in immunoglobulin-negative C3-positive glomerulonephritis (C3 glomerulopathy). Evaluation should include serum and urine electrophoresis and immunofixation as well as serum-free light-chain assay. If a monoclonal immunoglobulin is detected on these tests, bone marrow biopsy or imaging is needed to exclude more advanced plasma cell dyscrasia. Evaluation of alternative pathway of complement should be done in patients with Ig-negative C3-positive glomerulonephritis. If monoclonal gammopathy is due to an underlying malignant disease such as myeloma, lymphoma, or chronic lymphocytic leukemia, then specific treatment should be aimed at treating the malignant disease, with the goal of eradicating the clonal cells producing the immunoglobulin. In contrast, if monoclonal gammopathy is due to a monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance, treatment options include bortezomib, cyclophosphamide, and dexamethasone for a non-IgM monoclonal immunoglobulin and rituximab alone or in combination with cyclophosphamide and dexamethasone for an IgM monoclonal immunoglobulin.","['Copyright (c) 2013 Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: We retrospectively identified patients from January 1, 2001, through December 31, 2011, with active myelopathy in whom FDG-PET was performed. Inclusion criteria were (1) intramedullary myelopathy, (2) neoplastic/inflammatory etiology, and (3) FDG-PET performed after myelopathy onset. Exclusion criteria were (1) extramedullary myelopathy, (2) radiation-associated myelopathy, (3) no pathological confirmation of neoplasm, and (4) inactive myelopathy. Diagnostic categories of nonsarcoid inflammatory, neoplastic, and neurosarcoid were based on their final myelopathic diagnosis. Two radiologists who independently assessed FDG-PET for spinal cord hypermetabolism and maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax) were blinded to the underlying etiology. RESULTS: Fifty-one patients (53% women) with a median age of 60 years (range, 20-82 years) were included. Inflammatory myelopathic diagnoses (n=24) were as follows: paraneoplastic (n=13), autoimmune/other (n=5), inflammatory demyelinating (n=4), and transverse myelitis (n=2). Neoplastic diagnoses (n=21) were as follows: intramedullary metastases (n=12), intramedullary lymphoma/leukemia (n=7), and primary intramedullary neoplasm (n=2). Six patients had neurosarcoid myelopathy. Spinal cord hypermetabolism was more common with neoplastic myelopathy than with nonsarcoid inflammatory myelopathy (17 of 21 [81%] vs 6 of 24 [25%]; P<.001). Agreement between radiologist's assessments was excellent (kappa=0.88). Median SUVmax was greater in neoplastic than in nonsarcoid inflammatory causes of myelopathy (3.3 g/mL vs 1.9 g/mL; P<.001). The FDG-PET hypermetabolism was seen in 3 of the 6 patients (50%) with neurosarcoid myelopathy (median SUVmax, 2.6 g/mL; range, 1.8-12.2 g/mL). CONCLUSION: Spinal cord FDG-PET hypermetabolism in patients with active myelopathy may be reliably detected and was more common in neoplastic than in inflammatory myelopathies in this study. Future investigation of spinal cord FDG-PET is indicated to assess its potential contributions in evaluating active myelopathies.","['Copyright (c) 2013 Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research.

Polymorphisms in NK cell receptors as well as viral escape from NK cell responses are associated with pathogenesis and viral loads in HIV-infected individuals, emphasizing their importance in retroviral immunity. In contrast, NK cells of LCMV-infected mice dampened virus-specific T cell responses resulting in impaired virus control. Thus, the exact role of NK cells during different phases of viral infections remains elusive. In this study we characterized the NK cell response at different time points of an acute retroviral infection by using the Friend retrovirus (FV) mouse model. FINDINGS: Depletion of NK1.1(+) cells during the initial phase of FV infection (3 to 4 days post infection) resulted in increased viral loads, which correlated with enhanced target cell killing and elevated NK cell effector functions. At days 7 to 15 post infection, NK and NKT cells did not contribute to anti-retroviral immunity. In the transition phase between acute and chronic infection (30 days post infection), NK and NKT cells exhibited an inhibitory role and their depletion resulted in reduced viral loads and significantly improved FV-specific CD8(+) T cell responses. CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate an opposed activity of NK cells during retroviral infection. They were protective in the initial phase of infection, when adaptive T cell responses were not yet detectable, but were dispensable for viral immunity after T cell expansion. At later time points they exhibited regulatory functions in inhibiting virus-specific CD8(+) T cell responses.",,,,PMC3826539,,,,,,,,,,,,

We conducted a phase 2 trial of ponatinib in patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) or Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia (Ph-positive ALL). METHODS: We enrolled 449 heavily pretreated patients who had CML or Ph-positive ALL with resistance to or unacceptable side effects from dasatinib or nilotinib or who had the BCR-ABL T315I mutation. Ponatinib was administered at an initial dose of 45 mg once daily. The median follow-up was 15 months. RESULTS: Among 267 patients with chronic-phase CML, 56% had a major cytogenetic response (51% of patients with resistance to or unacceptable side effects from dasatinib or nilotinib and 70% of patients with the T315I mutation), 46% had a complete cytogenetic response (40% and 66% in the two subgroups, respectively), and 34% had a major molecular response (27% and 56% in the two subgroups, respectively). Responses were observed regardless of the baseline BCR-ABL kinase domain mutation status and were durable; the estimated rate of a sustained major cytogenetic response of at least 12 months was 91%. No single BCR-ABL mutation conferring resistance to ponatinib was detected. Among 83 patients with accelerated-phase CML, 55% had a major hematologic response and 39% had a major cytogenetic response. Among 62 patients with blast-phase CML, 31% had a major hematologic response and 23% had a major cytogenetic response. Among 32 patients with Ph-positive ALL, 41% had a major hematologic response and 47% had a major cytogenetic response. Common adverse events were thrombocytopenia (in 37% of patients), rash (in 34%), dry skin (in 32%), and abdominal pain (in 22%). Serious arterial thrombotic events were observed in 9% of patients; these events were considered to be treatment-related in 3%. A total of 12% of patients discontinued treatment because of an adverse event. CONCLUSIONS: Ponatinib had significant antileukemic activity across categories of disease stage and mutation status.

METHODS: Peripheral blood and bone marrow samples were harvested in 8 acute myeloid leukemia patients during and after induction chemotherapy. The CD34/CD38 cell profile was analyzed by multi-parameter flow cytometry. Adhesion profile was made using CXC chemokine receptor 4 (CXCR4) (CD184), VLA-4 (CD49d/CD29) and CD47. RESULTS: Chemotherapy +/- G-CSF mobilized immature cells (CD34(+)CD38(-) population), while the more mature cells (CD34(+)CD38(low) and CD34(+)CD38(+) populations) decreased progressively after treatment. Circulating CD34(+) cells tended to be more sensitive to chemotherapy after priming with G-CSF. CD34(+) cell mobilization was correlated with a gradual increase in CXCR4 and CD47 expression, suggesting a role in cell protection and the capacity of homing back to the marrow. CONCLUSION: Chemotherapy +/- G-CSF mobilizes into the circulation CD34(+) bone marrow cells, of which, the immature CD34(+)CD38(-) cell population.

The patterns of serum peptides from 123 patients with AL and 49 healthy controls were analyzed using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry. Furthermore, diagnostic models of differential peptides were established using the support vector machine (SVM) algorithm to discriminate between the AL patients and healthy controls or between the AL patients with various degrees of remission. Finally, the peptides were applied to evaluate the prognosis of the affected patients. The area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC), analyzed using the SVM algorithm to distinguish between the AL patients and healthy controls, was 0.921. The AUC of the models for distinguishing between the newly-diagnosed AL patients and those in AL-hematological complete remission (HCR) and between the AL-HCR patients from those in AL-molecular remission (MR), was 0.824 and 0.919, respectively. A short serum peptide of m/z 4625 was identified to decrease in density in parallel with an increase in the degree of remission, which was used to monitor the MRD level. The intensity of the m/z 4625 peptide was significantly correlated with a poor overall survival (OS). The m/z 4625 peptide was identified to be a partial fragment of SERPINA3.

The global methylation patterns in 19 diagnostic AML samples were investigated using the Methylated CpG Island Amplification Microarray (MCAM) method and CpG island microarrays containing 12,000 CpG sites. The first analysis, comparing favourable and intermediate cytogenetic risk groups, revealed significantly differentially methylated CpG sites (594 CpG islands) between the two subgroups. Mutations in the NPM1 gene occur at a high frequency (40%) within the NK-AML subgroup and are associated with a more favourable prognosis in these patients. A second analysis comparing the NPM1 mutant and wild-type research study subjects again identified distinct methylation profiles between these two subgroups. Network and pathway analysis revealed possible molecular mechanisms associated with the different risk and/or mutation sub-groups.

We recently identified WEE1 kinase as a novel target in leukemias. To identify genes that are synthetically lethal with WEE1 inhibition, we performed a short interfering RNA screen directed against cell cycle and DNA repair genes during concurrent treatment with the WEE1 inhibitor MK1775. CHK1 and ATR, genes encoding two replication checkpoint kinases, were among the genes whose silencing enhanced the effects of WEE1 inhibition most, whereas CDK2 short interfering RNA antagonized MK1775 effects. Building on this observation, we examined the impact of combining MK1775 with selective small molecule inhibitors of CHK1, ATR and cyclin-dependent kinases. The CHK1 inhibitor MK8776 sensitized acute myeloid leukemia cell lines and primary leukemia specimens to MK1775 ex vivo, whereas smaller effects were observed with the MK1775/MK8776 combination in normal myeloid progenitors. The ATR inhibitor VE-821 likewise enhanced the antiproliferative effects of MK1775, whereas the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor roscovitine antagonized MK1775. Further studies showed that MK8776 enhanced MK1775-mediated activation of the ATR/CHK1 pathway in acute leukemia cell lines and ex vivo.

SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Predictive factors for ovarian function were evaluated among 92 adult or pubertal female survivors transplanted at Huddinge and Helsinki University Hospital during 1978-2000, at a mean age of 9+/-4.3 years (range 1-19). At the time of the study a mean+/-s.d. of 13+/-5.5 years (range 6-27) had elapsed since the HSCT and the mean age of the participants was 22+/-6.3 years (range 9-41). RESULTS: Spontaneous puberty based on breast development occurred in 40 and menarche in 30 of the 70 girls who were prepubertal at transplantation. Six out of 20 girls who received HSCT after initiation of pubertal development recovered their ovarian function. Younger age at HSCT, conditioning without total body irradiation (TBI), and a non-leukemia diagnosis predicted the spontaneous menarche. The incidence of menarche was higher after fractioned vs single fraction TBI (P<0.05), cyclophosphamide (Cy) vs busulfan (Bu)-based conditioning (P<0.05), and among leukemia patients transplanted at first remission vs later remissions (P<0.01) and with no cranial irradiation (cranial radiotherapy, CRT) vs given CRT (14-24 Gy) (P<0.01). The majority of recipients conditioned with only Cy vs TBI (P<0.001) or vs Bu-based regimens (P<0.01) showed preserved ovarian function and required no estrogen replacement at their latest follow-up visit at a mean age of 23+/-6.3 years (range 15-41). Ten women became pregnant. CONCLUSIONS: Patients conditioned with TBI or Bu-based regimes are at high risk of ovarian failure. Intensive anti-leukemia therapy before HSCT including CRT especially among relapsed patients may further decrease the possibility of spontaneous menarche.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As Mn(2+) is already implemented as a ""positive"" cell contrast agent in preclinical imaging procedures (in the form of MnCl2 for neurological studies), the introduction of Mn in the porous network of MSNs would allow labelling cells and tracking them using MRI. These particles are in general internalized in endosomes, an acidic environment with high saline concentration. In addition, the available MSN porosity could also serve as a carrier to deliver medical/therapeutic substances through the labelled cells. In the present study, manganese oxide was introduced in the porous network of MCM-48 silica nanoparticles (Mn-M48SNs). The particles exhibit a narrow size distribution (~140 nm diam.) and high porosity (~60% vol.), which was validated after insertion of Mn. The resulting Mn-M48SNs were characterized by TEM, N2 physisorption, and XRD. Evidence was found with H2-TPR, and XPS characterization, that Mn(II) is the main oxidation state of the paramagnetic species after suspension in water, most probably in the form of Mn-OOH. The colloidal stability as a function of time was confirmed by DLS in water, acetate buffer and cell culture medium. In NMR data, no significant evidence of Mn(2+) leaching was found in Mn-M48SNs in acidic water (pH 6), up to 96 hours after suspension. High longitudinal relaxivity values of r1 = 8.4 mM(-1) s(-1) were measured at 60 MHz and 37 degrees C, with the lowest relaxometric ratios (r2/r1 = 2) reported to date for a Mn-MSN system. Leukaemia cells (P388) were labelled with Mn-M48SNs and nanoparticle cell internalization was confirmed by TEM. Finally, MRI contrast enhancement provided by cell labelling with escalated incubation concentrations of Mn-M48SNs was quantified at 1 T. This study confirmed the possibility of efficiently confining Mn into M48SNs using incipient wetness, while maintaining an open porosity and relatively high pore volume. Because these Mn-labelled M48SNs express strong ""positive"" contrast media properties at low concentrations, they are potentially applicable for cell tracking and drug delivery methodologies.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Patients were randomized to 5 mcg/kg single daily dose of IV bolus versus SC filgrastim given for its clinical indications. Patients were crossed-over to the alternate study arm on the subsequent chemotherapy course. The primary outcomes were time from initiation of filgrastim to recovery of stable neutrophil count of >500 cells/microL and a composite clinical outcome of infection or death assessed for the first course post-randomization. The study was stopped on the second interim analysis. Of 120 patients randomized, 118 were evaluated in the first treatment course. The mean time to neutropenia resolution was longer with IV G-CSF [7.9 days, 95% confidence interval (CI) 6.6-9.1] compared with SC G-CSF (5.4 days, 95% CI 4.6-6.2), log-rank P = 0.001. Longer neutropenia duration was observed in all patient subgroups, except for patients undergoing autologous HCT. There was no significant difference between groups in the occurrence of infection or death, but more deaths were observed with IV (4/57, 7%) versus SC (1/61, 1.6%) G-CSF administration, P = 0.196.

EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Selumetinib is an oral small-molecule inhibitor of MAP-ERK kinase (MEK)-1/2. Forty-seven patients with relapsed/refractory AML or 60 years old or more with untreated AML were enrolled on a phase II study. Patients were stratified by FLT3 ITD mutation status. The primary endpoint was response rate (complete, partial, and minor). Leukemia cells were analyzed for extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and mTOR phosphorylation. RESULTS: Common drug-related toxicities were grade 1-2 diarrhea, fatigue, nausea, vomiting, and skin rash. In the FLT3 wild-type cohort, six of 36 (17%) patients had a response [one partial response, three minor responses, two unconfirmed minor responses (uMR)]. No patient with FLT3 ITD responded. NRAS and KRAS mutations were detected in 7% and 2% of patients, respectively. The sole patient with KRAS mutation had uMR with hematologic improvement in platelets. Baseline p-ERK activation was observed in 85% of patients analyzed but did not correlate with a response. A single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs3733542 in exon 18 of the KIT gene was detected in significantly higher number of patients with response/stable disease compared with nonresponders (60% vs. 23%; P = 0.027). CONCLUSIONS: Selumetinib is associated with modest single-agent antileukemic activity in advanced AML. However, given its favorable toxicity profile, combination with drugs that target other signaling pathways in AML should be considered. The potential association of SNP rs3733542 in exon 18 of the KIT gene with antileukemic activity of selumetinib is intriguing, but will require validation in larger trials.",['(c)2013 AACR.'],,,PMC4310865,,,"['N01CM62201/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 CA009566/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 GM007019/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'N01-CM-62201/CM/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",['NIHMS538383'],,,,,,,,

With regard to treatment, children tend to be able to withstand a more aggressive treatment protocol than adults. The differences in both treatment modalities and outcomes between children and adults make extrapolation of adult studies to children inappropriate. The higher success is associated with a significant number of children experiencing nutrition-related adverse effects both in the short and long term after treatment. Specific treatment protocols have been shown to deplete nutrient levels, in particular antioxidants. The optimal nutrition prescription during, after and long-term following cancer treatment is unknown. This review article will provide an overview of the known physiologic processes of pediatric leukemia and how they contribute to the complexity of performing nutritional assessment in this population. It will also discuss known nutrition-related consequences, both short and long term in pediatric leukemia patients. Since specific antioxidants have been shown to be depleted as a consequence of therapy, the role of oxidative stress in the pediatric leukemia population will also be explored.

Patients with hematologic malignancies may be at greater risk for vancomycin-induced nephrotoxicity due to nephrotoxic chemotherapy and tumor lysis syndrome. OBJECTIVE: The primary objective of this study was to determine the occurrence of nephrotoxicity in adult patients with leukemia receiving vancomycin. METHODS: A retrospective review approved by the Institutional Review Board was conducted on adult patients with leukemia who received at least one dose of vancomycin during hospital admission between 1 January 2009 and 30 April 2009. RESULTS: Forty patients had an occurrence of nephrotoxicity (16%) while 210 patients did not have an occurrence of nephrotoxicity. In multivariate analysis, variables significantly associated with development of nephrotoxicity included active disease status (odds ratio, 4.38 [95% CI 1.1-29.4], p = 0.0291), concomitant intravenous acyclovir administration (odds ratio, 3.83 [95% CI, 1.6-8.9]; p = 0.0022), and concomitant amphotericin administration (odds ratio, 4.26 [95% CI, 1.9-9.4]; p = 0.0004). CONCLUSION: The occurrence of nephrotoxicity in patients with leukemia treated with vancomycin was 16% in our study, similar to previously published reports. Active disease status and concomitant use of intravenous acyclovir and amphotericin were identified as significant risk factors for development of nephrotoxicity. The presence of risk factors for vancomycin nephrotoxicity should be evaluated prior to initiation of therapy to determine appropriateness of use.","['(c) The Author(s) 2013 Reprints and permissions:', 'sagepub.co.uk/journalsPermissions.nav.']",['NOTNLM'],"['Vancomycin', 'leukemia', 'nephrotoxicity']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2013 Oct 29.,,"Prostate cancer (PCa) is a malignant disease influencing numerous men worldwide every year. However, the exact pathogenesis and the genes, environment, and other factors involved have not been explained clearly. Some studies have proposed that cell signaling pathways might play a key role in the development and progression of PCa. According to our previous study, the RTK/ERK pathway containing nearly 40 genes was associated with PCa risk. On the basis of these genes, we conducted a meta-analysis with our own Chinese Consortium for Prostate Cancer Genetics (ChinaPCa) study and available studies in the databases to describe the association between the pathway and PCa on the SNP level. The results suggested that rs4764695/IGF1 (recessive model: pooled OR=0.92, 95%CI=0.852-0.994, P=0.034; I(2)=0%, P=0.042; allele analysis: pooled OR=0.915, 95%CI=0.874-0.958, P=0; I(2)=0%, P=0.424; codominant model: OR=0.835, 95%CI=0.762-0.916, P=0; I(2)=0%, P=0.684) and rs1570360/VEGF (recessive model: OR=0.596, 95%CI=0.421-0.843, P=0.003; I(2)=23.9%, P=0.269; codominant model: OR=0.576, 95%CI=0.404-0.820, P=0.002; I(2)=49.1%, P=0.140) were significantly associated with PCa. In subgroup analysis, the relationship was also found in Caucasians for IGF1 (dominant model: OR=0.834, 95%CI=0.769-0.904, P=0; allele analysis: OR=0.908, 95%CI=0.863-0.955, P=0; AA vs CC: OR=0.829, 95%CI=0.750-0.916, P=0; AC vs CC: OR=0.837, 95%CI=0.768-0.912, P=0).

The results indicated that rs4764695/IGF1 and rs1570360/VEGF might play a key role in the development and progression of PCa.

Maintenance of HoxA9 overexpression is required for continued cell survival and proliferation, even in the presence of growth factors. We show for the first time that maintenance of Bcl-2 expression is critical for HoxA9-dependent immortalization and influences the latency of HoxA9-dependent leukemia. Hematopoietic cells lacking Bcl-2 were not immortalized by HoxA9 in vitro. Furthermore, deletion of Bcl-2 delayed the onset and reduced the severity of HoxA9/Meis1 and MLL-AF9 leukemias.

However, the factors that determine its transmission efficiency are not fully understood. The viral genome encodes the HTLV-1 bZIP factor (HBZ), which is expressed in all ATL cases and is known to promote T-cell proliferation. In this study, we investigated the hypothesis that HBZ also influences the survival of T cells. Through analyzing the transcriptional profile of HBZ-expressing cells, we learned that HBZ suppressed transcription of the proapoptotic gene Bim (Bcl2l11) and that HBZ-expressing cells were resistant to activation-induced apoptosis. Mechanistic investigations into how HBZ suppresses Bim expression revealed that HBZ perturbs the localization and function of FoxO3a, a critical transcriptional activator of the genes encoding Bim and also Fas ligand (FasL). By interacting with FoxO3a, HBZ not only attenuated DNA binding by FoxO3a but also sequestered the inactive form of FoxO3a in the nucleus. In a similar manner, HBZ also inhibited FasL transcription induced by T-cell activation. Further study of ATL cells identified other Bim perturbations by HBZ, including at the level of epigenetic alteration, histone modification in the promoter region of the Bim gene. Collectively, our results indicated that HBZ impairs transcription of the Bim and FasL genes by disrupting FoxO3a function, broadening understanding of how HBZ acts to promote proliferation of HTLV-1-infected T cells by blocking their apoptosis.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study analyzed the influence of age on the results of mobilization of peripheral blood stem cells (PBSCs) in healthy donors as well as on the engraftment and outcome of HSCT. METHODS: A retrospective analysis from a single center was performed comparing the results of PBSC mobilization from related healthy donors according to their age. RESULTS: The study included 133 consecutive related donors. The median age was 50 years (range, 4-77 years); 70 (53%) donors were males, and 44 (33%) were >55 years old. All donors were mobilized with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor for 5 days. The peak CD34(+) cell count in peripheral blood was higher in younger than in older donors (median, 90.5 CD34(+) cells/muL [range, 18-240 CD34(+) cells/muL] versus 72 CD34(+) cells/muL [range, 20-172.5 CD34(+) cells/muL], P = 0.008). The volume processed was lower in younger than in older donors (16,131 mL [range, 4424-36,906 mL] versus 18,653 mL [range, 10,003-26,261 mL], P = 0.002) with similar CD34(+) cells collected (579.3 x 10(6) cells [range, 135.14 x 10(6)-1557.24 x 10(6) cells] versus 513.69 x 10(6) cells [range, 149.81 x 10(6)-1290 x 10(6) cells], P = 0.844). There were no differences in time to recovery of neutrophils and platelets or in the incidences of acute and chronic graft-versus-host disease, overall survival, non-relapse mortality and relapse incidence. CONCLUSIONS: Donors >55 years old mobilized fewer CD34(+) cells and required a greater volume to collect a similar number of CD34(+) cells. The outcome of HSCT was not influenced by donor age. Donor age should not be a limitation for related allogeneic HSCT.","['Copyright (c) 2014 International Society for Cellular Therapy. Published by', 'Elsevier Inc.

It is readily expandable, does not express human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class I and II and can be stably transduced with various genes. METHODS: In order to generate cytomegalovirus (CMV) antigen-specific T cells for adoptive immunotherapy, we transduced K562 with HLA-A *0201 in combination with co-stimulatory molecules. RESULTS: In preliminary experiments, irradiated K562 expressing HLA-A *0201 and 4-1BBL pulsed with CMV pp65 and IE-1 peptide libraries failed to elicit antigen-specific CD8(+) T cells in HLA-A *0201(+) peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) or isolated T cells. Both wild-type K562 and aAPC strongly inhibited T cell proliferation to the bacterial superantigen staphylococcal enterotoxin B (SEB) and OKT3 and in mixed lymphocyte reaction (MLR). Transwell experiments suggested that suppression was mediated by a soluble factor; however, MLR inhibition was not reversed using transforming growth factor-beta blocking antibody or prostaglandin E2 inhibitors. Full abrogation of the suppressive activity of K562 on MLR, SEB and OKT3 stimulation was only achieved by brief fixation with 0.1% formaldehyde. Fixed, pp65 and IE-1 peptide-loaded aAPC induced robust expansion of CMV-specific T cells. CONCLUSIONS: Fixed gene-modified K562 can serve as effective aAPC to expand CMV-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes for therapeutic use in patients after stem cell transplantation.

Considerable efforts have, thus, been made to incorporate immunotherapeutic approaches in the acute myeloid leukemia (AML) consolidation, with so far disappointing clinical benefit. The B7 family ligand programmed-death receptor-ligand 1 (PD-L1, B7-H1, CD274) has been recently described (with conflicting results) to be expressed on AML blast cells, and interaction with its receptor on T cells, programmed death receptor-1 (PD-1, CD279), has been shown to suppress T-cell functions and to allow survival of dormant AML cells in animal models. DESIGN AND METHODS: In this work, we analyzed freshly isolated myeloid precursor cells from healthy donors and from AML patients for PD-L1 expression with or without interferon-gamma exposure at different time points during their treatment. RESULTS: While without IFN exposure, only minor differences were observed, we found IFN-gamma-induced PD-L1 expression most prominent after initial treatment and independent of treatment outcome. CONCLUSIONS: Our observations support the recently suggested PD-L1-mediated adaptive immune resistance and argue for a targeting of the PD-L1/PD-1 pathway during the consolidation phase of AML treatment.",['(c) 2013 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

RESULTS: From age group 10-19 years to age group >/= 60 years, the percentage of LC decreased from 67.0 +/- 18.4% to 49.0 +/- 25.1% (F = 2.353, P = 0.041). LC percentage was higher in patients with balanced karyotypes (65.7 +/- 22.4%), than those with unbalanced karyotypes (46.0 +/- 26.6%) (u = 3.444, P = 0.001) or a normal karyotype (49.9 +/- 22.1%) (u = 5.093, P < 0.001).

We summarized the data on the association between the NQO1 609C>T polymorphism and risk of leukemia and performed subgroup analyses by ethnicity and leukemia type. We found that the variant TT homozygous genotype o was associated with a modestly increased risk of leukemia (TT versus CT/CC: OR = 1.23, 95%CI = 1.00 - 1.51, heterogeneity = 0.76; I2 = 0%). Following further stratified analyses, increased risk was only observed in subgroups of Caucasians. This meta-analysis suggests that the NQO1 609T allele is a high-penetrance risk factor for leukemia in Caucasians. The effect on leukemia may be modified by ethnicity and leukemia type, and the small sample sizes of the subgroup analyses suggest that further larger studies are needed.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PTMs alter the conformation, the stability, the localization, and hence the pattern of interactions of the targeted protein. Cell pathways involve the activation of enzymes, like kinases, ligases and transferases, that, once activated, act on many proteins simultaneously, altering the state of the cell and triggering the processes they are involved in. Viruses enter a balanced system and hijack the cell, exploiting the potential of PTMs either to activate viral encoded proteins or to alter cellular pathways, with the ultimate consequence to perpetuate through their replication. Human T-lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-1) is known to be highly oncogenic and associates with adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma, HTLV-1-associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis and other inflammatory pathological conditions. HTLV-1 protein activity is controlled by PTMs and, in turn, viral activity is associated with the modulation of cellular pathways based on PTMs. More knowledge is acquired about the PTMs involved in the activation of its proteins, like Tax, Rex, p12, p13, p30, HTLV-I basic leucine zipper factor and Gag.

This algorithm has been used in many applications such as data analysis, pattern recognition, and image segmentation. It has the advantages of producing high quality segmentation compared to the other available algorithms. Many modifications have been made to the algorithm to improve its segmentation quality. The proposed segmentation algorithm in this paper is based on the Fuzzy C-Means algorithm adding the relational fuzzy notion and the wavelet transform to it so as to enhance its performance especially in the area of 2D gel images. Both proposed modifications aim to minimize the oversegmentation error incurred by previous algorithms. The experimental results of comparing both the Fuzzy C-Means (FCM) and the Wavelet Fuzzy C-Means (WFCM) to the proposed algorithm on real 2D gel images acquired from human leukemias, HL-60 cell lines, and fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) demonstrate the improvement achieved by the proposed algorithm in overcoming the segmentation error. In addition, we investigate the effect of denoising on the three algorithms. This investigation proves that denoising the 2D gel image before segmentation can improve (in most of the cases) the quality of the segmentation.",,,,PMC3794507,,,,,,,,,,,,

We also studied the mode of action of the most active plants, Gladiolus quartinianus, Vepris soyauxii, and Anonidium mannii. Methods. The cytotoxicity of the extracts was determined using a resazurin assay. Flow cytometry was used for cell-cycle analysis and detection of apoptosis, analysis of mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), and measurement of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Results. At 40 g/mL, three extracts showed a growth of CCRF-CEM leukemia cells by less than 50%. This includes the extracts from G. quartinianus (GQW; 25.69%), Vepris soyauxii leaves (VSL; 29.82%), and Anonidium mannii leaves (AML; 31.58%). The lowest IC50 values below 30 mu g/mL were obtained with GQW, AML and VSL against 7/9, 8/9, and 9/9 tested cancer cell lines, respectively. The lowest IC50 values for each plant were 4.09 mu g/mL, and 9.14 mu g/mL (against U87MG.DeltaEGFR cells), respectively, for VSL and AML and 10.57 mu g/mL (against CCRF-CEM cells) for GQW. GQW induced cell cycle arrest between G0/G1 and S phases, whilst VSL and AML induced arrest in G0/G1. All three extracts induced apoptosis in CCRF-CEM cells by loss of MMP, whilst AML also enhanced production of ROS. Conclusion. The three active plants may be a source for the development of new anticancer drugs.",,,,PMC3794640,,,,,,,,,,,,

We found that ectopic expression of INS alone in hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells caused myeloproliferative disorders, whereas expression of INS in combination with a Notch1 mutant led to the development of much more aggressive T-ALL than with wild-type IL7Ralpha. Furthermore, forced expression of INS in common lymphoid progenitors led to the development of mature B-cell ALL/lymphoma.

We used this approach to examine the chromatin dynamics of the HoxA cluster in a human myeloid leukemia cell line at various stages of differentiation. We found that cellular differentiation involves a transient activation of the 5'-end HoxA genes coinciding with a loss of contacts throughout the cluster, and by specific silencing at the 3'-end with H3K27 methylation.

In this review, we have summarized the roles of PKC family members in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). CLL is a heterogeneous hematological disorder with survival ranging from months to decades. PKC isoforms are differentially expressed in CLL and play critical roles in CLL pathogenesis. Thus, isoform-specific PKC inhibitors may be an attractive option for CLL treatment.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Caffeine, the most widely used neuroactive compound, has antiproliferative activity and the ability to induce cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. In the current study, the effect of concomitant use of caffeine on paclitaxelinduced apoptosis in CRC cells was investigated. The results revealed that treatment of Colo205 cells with varying caffeine concentrations did not induce apoptosis. Pretreatment of CRC cells with caffeine significantly inhibited paclitaxelinduced cytotoxicity by increasing the levels of the antiapoptotic Bcl2 family member, Mcl1. This effect was inhibited by pretreatment of Colo205 cells with the MEKERK chemical inhibitor, U0126. In addition to GRP78, these results indicated that Mcl1 may be a downstream target of the MEKERK signaling pathway. Moreover, administration of caffeine may decrease chemotherapeutic responses to paclitaxel by the MEKERK mediated upregulation of Mcl1. In conclusion, coadministration of cell cyclemodifying agents, including caffeine should be avoided in CRC patients treated with paclitaxel.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This analysis demonstrates that clones labelled by the two types of viruses display similar features and bring about new insights on the relationships between mitotic and migratory properties of the myocardial cells and histogenesis of the heart. Since only exteriormost cells were tagged with our inoculation procedure, our analysis shows that: (1) at stages 17-19, the myocardium is composed of cells with diverse potentials; some cells still retain the capacity to divide extensively and participate to different heart muscle layers, whilst most are restricted in their multiplication potential and contribute to single muscle layers; (2) about half of the clones are located deep in the heart wall, revealing extensive cell migrations from the heart surface to the ventricular trabeculae, the first migrating cells tagged being detected 20 h after viral inoculation. The presence of these cells is consistent with the finding of a large number of compact trabecular clones 5 days later suggesting that these cells divide mainly after completing migration. Our approach provides new insights as well as quantitative data on the different processes involved in heart morphogenesis, namely multiplication, migration and localisation of heart muscle cells.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

QH also induced caspase-3 cleavage (2-fold) and increased PARP cleavage. Specificity protein (Sp) transcription factors are overexpressed in cancer cells and regulate genes required for cell proliferation, survival and angiogenesis. QH treatment decreased the expression of Sp1, Sp3 and Sp4 mRNA and this was accompanied by decreased protein expression. Moreover, expression of the Sp-dependent anti-apoptotic survival gene survivin was also significantly reduced, both at the mRNA and protein levels. QH decreased microRNA-27a (miR-27a) and induced the zinc finger protein ZBTB10, an Sp-repressor, suggesting that interactions between QH and the miR-27a-ZBTB10 axis play a role in Sp downregulation. This was confirmed by transfection of cells with a specific mimic for miR-27a, which partially reversed the effects of QH.

We developed a q-RT-PCR to assess the JAK2WT and JAK2V617F mRNA expression in 105 cases (23 donors, 13 secondary polycythemia, 22 polycythemia vera (PV), 38 essential thrombocythemia (ET), and 9 primary myelofibrosis (PMF)). Compared with the standard allele-specific oligonucleotide (ASO)-PCR technique, our assay showed a 100 % concordance rate detecting the JAK2V617F mutation in 22/22 PV (100 %), 29/38 (76.3 %) ET, and 5/9 (55.5 %) PMF cases, respectively. The sensitivity of the assay was 0.01 %. Comparing DNA and RNA samples, we found that the JAK2V617F mutational ratios were significantly higher at the RNA level both in PV (p = 0.005) and ET (p = 0.001) samples. In PV patients, JAK2WT expression levels positively correlated with the platelets (PLTs) (p = 0.003) whereas a trend to negative correlation was observed with the Hb levels (p = 0.051). JAK2V617F-positive cases showed the lowest JAK2WT and ABL1 mRNA expression levels. In all the samples, the expression pattern of beta-glucoronidase (GUSB) was more homogeneous than that of ABL1 or beta2 microglobulin (B2M). Using GUSB as normalizator gene, a significant increase of the JAK2V617F mRNA levels was seen in two ET patients at time of progression to PV. In conclusion, the proposed q-RT-PCR is a sensitive and accurate method to quantify the JAK2 mutational status that can also show clinical correlations suggesting the impact of the residual amount of the JAK2WT allele on the Ph- MPN disease phenotype. Our observations also preclude the use of ABL1 as a housekeeping gene for these neoplasms.",,,,PMC3945640,,,,,,,,,,,,

Hallmarks of naive pluripotency include driving Oct4 (also known as Pou5f1) transcription by its distal enhancer, retaining a pre-inactivation X chromosome state, and global reduction in DNA methylation and in H3K27me3 repressive chromatin mark deposition on developmental regulatory gene promoters. Upon withdrawal of 2i/LIF, naive mouse ES cells can drift towards a primed pluripotent state resembling that of the post-implantation epiblast. Although human ES cells share several molecular features with naive mouse ES cells, they also share a variety of epigenetic properties with primed murine epiblast stem cells (EpiSCs). These include predominant use of the proximal enhancer element to maintain OCT4 expression, pronounced tendency for X chromosome inactivation in most female human ES cells, increase in DNA methylation and prominent deposition of H3K27me3 and bivalent domain acquisition on lineage regulatory genes. The feasibility of establishing human ground state naive pluripotency in vitro with equivalent molecular and functional features to those characterized in mouse ES cells remains to be defined. Here we establish defined conditions that facilitate the derivation of genetically unmodified human naive pluripotent stem cells from already established primed human ES cells, from somatic cells through induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cell reprogramming or directly from blastocysts. The novel naive pluripotent cells validated herein retain molecular characteristics and functional properties that are highly similar to mouse naive ES cells, and distinct from conventional primed human pluripotent cells. This includes competence in the generation of cross-species chimaeric mouse embryos that underwent organogenesis following microinjection of human naive iPS cells into mouse morulas.

Fifteen minutes after the PC transfusion began, she developed chills and rapidly worsened to septic shock. The episode was managed appropriately. The patient's blood cultures and PC unit cultures grew Escherichia coli. The microbiological susceptibilities of isolates from the patient and platelet bag were identical. No other source of E coli was found. Donor and blood products issued from the same donation investigations were negative. The causality between sepsis and PC transfusion might be difficult to confirm.

METHODS: Bacterial artificial chromosomes (BAC) clones that contain the targeted genes including AML1, ETO, WT1, p27 and c-kit were searched in the data base UCSC Genome Bioinformatics. Multicolor FISH probes were prepared by linking fluorescein labeled dUTP or dCTP to targeted genes by nick translation. Bone marrow mononuclear cells from t (8;21) AML patients are dropped on to the wet surface of glass slides after hypotonic treatment and fixation. After hybridization, the fluorescence signals were captured by Zeiss fluorescence microscope. The copy number of AML1, ETO, WT1, p27, c- kit and the AML1-ETO fusion gene in AML1-ETO positive cells was counted. The cells with same signals were defined as a subclone. Various subclones were recorded and their proportions were calculated, and their evolutionary relationship was deduced. The subclones in matched primary and relapsed samples were compared, the evolution of dominant clones were figured out and the genomic abnormality that is associated with relapse and drug resistance were speculated. RESULTS: In this study, 36 primary AML with t(8;21) cases and 1 relapsed case paired with the primary case were detected. In these 36 primary cases, 4 cases (11.1%) acquired additional AML1-ETO fusion signal, 3(8.3%) had additional AML1 signal, 4(11.1%) had additional ETO signal, 20(55.6%) had additional WT1 signal, 15(41.7%) had additional p27 signal and 14(38.9%) had additional c-kit signal. In addition, 10(27.8%) displayed AML1 signal deletion, and such an aberration represents statistic significance in male patients. It seems that male patients usually accompany AML1 signal deletion. Of 36 cases, 28(77.8 %) harbored at least 2 subclones (ranged from 2 to 10). According to the genetic signature of subclones, we can assemble a putative ancestral tree, and the genetic architecture is linear or branching. In particular, the clonal architecture of the relapsed sample exhibited significant clonal evolution compared to its paired sample at diagnosis, including proportion changes in dominant clone, subclone disappearance and appearance of new dominant clones. CONCLUSION: Genomic abnormality is very diverse in t(8;21) AML. Subclones have linear or complex branching evolutionary histories, and clonal architecture is dynamic.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Eleven patients with T-PLL admitted in our hospital from Jan 2006 to Oct 2012 were retrospectively analyzed. RESULTS: Of the 11 patients, nine were males and two females, with the median age of 56.0(19-69) years old. All the patients, except for three, presented with leukocytosis. The incidence of hyperleukocytosis (1/11) was less frequent than that in the British series (75%) (P=0.000). Lymphocyte counts in peripheral blood were increased in 9 of the 11 patients with the median absolute lymphocyte count (ALC) of 17.22(0.58-148.83)x10(9)/L. Superficial lymphadenopathy and splenomegaly were the most common physical signs. It was common that serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and beta 2 microglobulin(beta2-MG)were higher than normal level. All cases were positive for CD2/CD3/CD5/TCRalphabeta, negative for CD1a /HLA-DR and TdT, and most of them were strong positive for CD7 expression. By chromosome analyses, most cases. (9/10) have normal chromosome. This rate is significantly higher than that of the British and American series (3% and 25%, respectively) (P=0.000, P=0.001). The 14q11 abnormality and trisomy 8q, which are common among Western cases, were not observed in any of our cases. With a median follow-up of 23.0 months, three patients died. Two year progress free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were 53.3% and 50%, respectively. There were 3 patients with PFS over a number of years, whether it should be considered as the T-chronic lymphocytic leukemia (T-CLL) is worthy of further studies. CONCLUSION: The common clinical manifestations of T-PLL patients were increased lymphocyte counts and lymphadenopathy as well as splenomegaly.

Patients with a CD38(+) CLL clone display a more aggressive form of the disease with earlier treatment requirements and ultimately shorter overall survival than patients with a CD38(-) clone. Several lines of evidence indicate that CD38 is not only a diagnostic marker but also a key element in the molecular network regulating disease maintenance and progression. First, CD38 is a receptor that induces proliferation and increases survival of CLL cells. Second, CD38 signals facilitate access of CLL cells to growth-favorable districts. This is achieved by enhancing i) chemotaxis towards CXCL12, ii) integrin-mediated adhesion and iii) matrix metalloprotease synthesis and secretion. Third, blocking monoclonal antibodies targeting CD38 impair CLL homing to spleen and bone marrow in xenograft models. These functions appear to be modulated by frontal interactions with CD31 as well as by lateral associations on the CLL membrane to form a large supramolecular complex similar to the invadosomes of epithelial cells. Our understanding has evolved from considering CD38 as a marker of unfavorable prognosis to recognizing its function as a disease modifier. Studies in the next few years will likely determine whether the molecule can also serve as a target for new therapies, using monoclonal antibodies, inhibitors of the enzymatic activity or both.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Members of the DGK family undergo alternative splicing, generating the protein diversity necessary to control different intracellular DAG pools. DGKalpha function is altered in polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMNs) of patients with localized aggressive periodontitis (LAgP), suggesting a genetic basis. Here, the authors assess DGKalpha spliced transcripts in human LAgP neutrophils. METHODS: In an expression library of a patient with LAgP, PMNs were screened for different DGKalpha transcripts. Real-time polymerase chain reaction and in vitro expression assays were performed to assess the fate of different transcripts on protein translocation and superoxide production in human leukemia cells (HL-60) and COS-7 cells. RESULTS: A DGKalpha transcript that lacks exon 10 (DGKalphaDelta10) and generates a premature stop codon and a truncated protein was identified as being upregulated in LAgP neutrophils. In vitro assays revealed that DGKalphaDelta10 translocation occurred even in the absence of important regulatory motifs.

Genetic polymorphisms in tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) -308 and lymphotoxin-alpha (LT-alpha) +252 may affect their transcription and expression which leads to their high plasma level. The frequency of the TNF-alpha (-308) and LT-alpha (+ 252) polymorphisms are different for NHL and ALL cases in various populations with different ethnicity. This research is designed to investigate the prevalence and association of TNF-alpha (-308) and LT-alpha (+ 252) polymorphisms from NHL and ALL in Azarian patients and healthy individuals from Northwestern part of Iran. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Seventy subjects with ALL and 68 NHL, along with another 130 healthy subjects as control group took part in this study. Genomic DNA was extracted, then genetic polymorphisms in TNF-alpha and LT-alpha genes were analyzed with the PCR-RFLP and NCOI as restriction enzyme. A statistical analysis was performed by chi-square test using SPSS software. A P-value of <0.05 was considered statistically significant. RESULTS: A statistically significant difference of LT-alpha polymorphism was in NHL patients and control (P-value= 0.008) but there was not any association of TNF-alpha polymorphism between NHL patients and control group. A significant association for TNF-a variant was in ALL and control (P-value =0.005), however, there was no relationship about LT variant between ALL and control.

Recent trends in prolongation of child-bearing age have made cancer-associated pregnancies more frequent than past. As yet there are few documents concerning cancer and its related treatment outcomes during pregnancy. This study aimed at describing clinical characteristics of pregnant women with cancer in the Shahid Sadoughi hospital in Yazd, Iran. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Case series were reviewed retrospectively, which included 19 pregnant women diagnosed with cancer in Shahid Sadoughi hospital from 2002 to 2012. Data collected comprised demographics, pregnancy characteristics and outcomes, type of cancer, clinical stage, treatment and oncological. RESULTS: From 17 pregnant women with cancer, 4 women had gynecologic cancers and 13 had non-gynecologic cancers. The Following tumors were observed: breast [6], acute myeloblastic leukemia [3], uterine cervix carcinoma [3], ovary [1], chronic myelogenous leukemia [1], lymphoma [1], papillary carcinoma of thyroid [1], and pseudopapillary carcinoma of pancreas [1]. The mean age of patients was 30.6 years, and the mean gestational age at diagnosis was 21.1 weeks. Surgical treatment was performed in 3 patients, 6 patients were treated by chemotherapy, and in 3 by both. DISCUSSION: Although cancer during pregnancy is uncommon, it is considered an important problem due to unsuitable maternal and fetal outcomes and lack of standard management guidelines. Our cases represent examples of feasible or justifiable managements for them.",,['NOTNLM'],"['Yazd', 'cancer', 'diagnosis', 'management', 'outcome', 'pregnancy', 'treatment']",PMC3809349,,,,,,,,,,,,

In addition, visceral fat deposition, fatty changes in the liver, and metabolic derangements such as insulin resistance and hypertriglyceridemia were evident. These features resemble Dunnigan-type familial partial lipodystrophy, which is a rare condition caused by LMNA gene mutation. These patients shared a common medical history involving HSCT, including conditioning with total body irradiation (TBI). They also received intensive chemotherapy because of multiple metastases (n = 3), relapse (n = 3), and repetitive HSCT (n = 3).

Children with severe congenital neutropenia chronically receive pharmacologic doses of GCSF, and approximately 30% will develop myelodysplasia/acute myeloid leukemia (AML) associated with GCSFR truncation mutations. In addition to mutations, multiple isoforms of CSF3R have also been reported. We found elevated expression of the alternatively spliced isoform, class IV CSF3R in adult myelodysplastic syndrome/AML patients. Aside from its association with monosomy 7 and higher rates of relapse in pediatric AML patients, little is known about the biology of the class IV isoform. We found developmental regulation of CSF3R isoforms with the class IV expression more representative of a progenitor cell stage. Striking differences were found in phosphoprotein signaling involving Janus kinase (JAK)-signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) and cell cycle gene expression. Enhanced proliferation by class IV GCSFR was associated with diminished STAT3 and STAT5 activation, yet showed sensitivity to JAK2 inhibitors.

However, compared with NOTCH1-WT CLL, mutated cases displayed biochemical and transcriptional evidence of an intense activation of the NOTCH1 pathway. In vivo, expression and activation of NOTCH1 was highest in CLL cells from the lymph nodes as confirmed by immunohistochemistry. In vitro, the NOTCH1 pathway was rapidly downregulated, suggesting that signaling relies upon micro-environmental interactions even in NOTCH1-mutated cases. Accordingly, co-culture of Jagged1(+) (the NOTCH1 ligand) nurse-like cells with autologous CLL cells sustained NOTCH1 activity over time and mediated CLL survival and resistance against pro-apoptotic stimuli, both abrogated when NOTCH1 signaling was pharmacologically switched off. Together, these results show that NOTCH1 mutations have stabilizing effects on the NOTCH1 pathway in CLL. Furthermore, micro-environmental interactions appear critical in activating the NOTCH1 pathway both in WT and mutated patients. Finally, NOTCH1 signals may create conditions that favor drug resistance, thus making NOTCH1 a potential molecular target in CLL.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We previously developed an immunostimulatory strategy based on targeted Stat3 silencing in Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9)-positive hematopoietic cells using CpG-small interfering RNA (siRNA) conjugates. Here, we assessed the therapeutic effect of systemic STAT3 blocking/TLR9 triggering in disseminated acute myeloid leukemia (AML). We used mouse Cbfb-MYH11/Mpl-induced leukemia model, which mimics human inv(16) AML. Our results demonstrate that intravenously delivered CpG-Stat3 siRNA, but not control oligonucleotides, can eradicate established AML and impair leukemia-initiating potential. These antitumor effects require host's effector T cells but not TLR9-positive antigen-presenting cells. Instead, CpG-Stat3 siRNA has direct immunogenic effect on AML cells in vivo upregulating major histocompatibility complex class-II, costimulatory and proinflammatory mediators, such as interleukin-12, while downregulating coinhibitory PD-L1 molecule. Systemic injections of CpG-Stat3 siRNA generate potent tumor antigen-specific immune responses, increase the ratio of tumor-infiltrating CD8(+) T cells to regulatory T cells in various organs, and result in CD8(+) T-cell-dependent regression of leukemia. Our findings underscore the potential of using targeted STAT3 inhibition/TLR9 triggering to break tumor tolerance and induce immunity against AML and potentially other TLR9-positive blood cancers.",,,,PMC3879904,,,"['R01 CA155367/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA172447/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA166770/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01CA166770/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA033572/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01CA155367/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,['Blood. 2014 Jan 2;123(1):1-2.

Epub 2013 Oct 26.,,"BACKGROUND AIMS: Hematopoietic stem cell cryopreservation significantly contributed to autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT). Cryopreserved stem cell units (SCU) are expected to be used soon after harvesting for most purposes, but, in a number of cases, they remain stored for some time, creating an increasing load for SCU depositories. Disposal policies vary widely in each center, and the existing guidelines are insufficient. METHODS: We conducted a survey of seven Gruppo Italiano Trapianto di Midollo Osseo centers to investigate the outcome of SCU harvested from January 2005 to December 2009 for ASCT. The data from 1603 collections were gathered, for a total of 5822 SCU. RESULTS: In our cohort, 79% of patients collected >5 x 10(6) CD34+ cells/kg, and 3.4% collected <2 x 10(6) CD34+ cells/kg. Up to 21% of all the patients and 42% of those with acute leukemia did not undergo reinfusion, and 37% of the cryopreserved SCU were excess, resulting from patients not reinfusing or partially reinfusing. Less than one-third of the excess SCU was disposed, and the major causes of disposal were death and, in a minority of cases, withdrawal of the indication for ASCT. In our analysis, very few first reinfusions occurred after 2 years, and those after 5 years were exceptional. Through the use of a multivariate analysis, we sought to identify the risk factors for collection non-use, independent of the centers' policies. Non-use of SCU was significantly associated with patients with acute leukemia, collections of <2 x 10(6) CD34/kg and lower age groups. CONCLUSIONS: These data serve as a valid basis to support rational recommendations for cost-effective storage and disposal of SCU.","['Copyright (c) 2014 International Society for Cellular Therapy.

Cytogenetic alterations, mutations and rearrangements may be considered as molecular legacy which trace the clonal history of the disease. Concomitant tumors are reported and they may derive from a common or divergent founder clone. B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL) and plasma cell myeloma (PCM) are both mature B-cell neoplasms, and their concomitancy, albeit rare, is documented. CASE PRESENTATION: Here, we described a patient with prior B-CLL with secondary development of PCM. Cytogenetic and multi parametric flow cytometry analyses were performed. The B-CLL population presented chromosome 12 trisomy, unlikely the arisen PCM population. CONCLUSION: The close follow up of B-CLL patients is important for early intervention in case of development of other malignancy, such as myeloma.

OBJECTIVE: We describe our methods using the recently developed, commercially available, tetramethylrhodamine-5-isothiocyanate-labeled PG-M3 anti-PML antibody for APL testing. DESIGN: Immunofluorescence staining with the tetramethylrhodamine-5-isothiocyanate-labeled PG-M3 antibody was used to detect PML-RARA in bone marrow aspirate and/or peripheral blood smears from 30 patients with acute leukemia. The results were compared with those of concurrent testing with our in-house polyclonal anti-PML antibody and with established tests. RESULTS: All APL cases showed a positive (fine/microgranular) immunofluorescence staining pattern, whereas non-APL cases showed a negative (chunky/macrogranular) pattern. These results, which were available within 2 hours, were validated by testing with the polyclonal anti-PML antibody and with established cytogenetic and molecular testing methods. CONCLUSIONS: We validated the utility of the tetramethylrhodamine-5-isothiocyanate-labeled anti-PML antibody PG-M3 for the diagnosis of APL. Our results indicate that immunofluorescence staining with this antibody is a rapid and reliable method for the diagnosis of APL.",,,,,,,['P30 CA016672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,

The first episode of PTLD with a large retroperitoneal tumor occurred one yr after transplantation; a residual tumor infiltrating spleen and colon was resected one yr later.

The aim of the present study was to investigate the impact of rs1544105 polymorphism on the treatment outcome in pediatric B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (BCP-ALL). METHODS: This study enrolled 164 children with BCP-ALL. We genotyped the FPGS SNP rs1544105, and analyzed the associations between its genotypes and treatment outcome. We also examined FPGS mRNA levels by real-time PCR in 64 of the 164 children, and investigated the function of this polymorphism on gene expression. RESULTS: We found significantly poor relapse-free survival (RFS) (p = 0.010) and poor event-free survival (EFS) (p = 0.046) in carriers of CC genotype. Multivariable Cox regression analyses adjusted for possible confounding variables showed that, relative to the CT + TT genotypes, the CC genotype was an independent prognostic factor for poor RFS (hazard ratio [HR], 4.992.; 95% CI, 1.550-16.078; p = 0.007). No association was found between any toxicity and rs1544105 polymorphism. Quantitative PCR results showed that individuals with the T allele had lower levels of FPGS transcripts.

Individual equipoise applies to an individual clinician or a member of ethical, institutional review board (IRB), whilst collective equipoise refers to the profession as a whole. It is argued that physicians are not bound by the equipoise but their actions are directed by the confines of the expert opinion. Experts can agree or disagree in various proportions on the merit of a given treatment. Hence, the collective equipoise will be often incomplete. In turn, the opinions of content expert in the field of the proposed trial influence the IRB members' decision regarding trial approval. METHODS: We conducted a survey of IRB members at University of South Florida and the IRB members attending the bioethics conference organized in Clearwater, Florida, USA. The survey was made available as hard copy (paper based) and included six hypothetical scenarios outlining clinical trials targeted at measuring the collective equipoise. We defined the collective equipoise as the situation when survey participants were equally split (50:50) in their decision regarding whether a proposed clinical trial would be ethical to conduct. The opinion of 100 experts in the field expressed as proportion of experts favoring treatment A vs. B in each of the five scenarios was made available to the participants. RESULTS: The response rate of our survey was 33% (71/218). Fifty percent of the IRB members would approve an RCT addressing the efficacy of two drugs for the management of headache even if 80% of experts favor one treatment over another (median: 80%; third quartile: 80%). Similarly, half of participating IRB members would approve the study when the median distribution of equipoise among experts was 70% (70 in favor of treatment A vs. 30 in favor of treatment B) for treatment of leukemia, 60% for treatment of geriatric patients and 70% for treatment of newborns. Half of IRB members would approve the study when the median distribution of equipoise among experts was 70% for treatment for leukemia in dogs and 85% for leukemia in rats (and 25% of IRB members would approve such a study even if 100% of experts favors one treatment over another). None of the demographic features of respondents affected collective equipoise. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study assessing collective equipoise among ethical committee/IRB members. Our study findings show that IRB members perceived that conduct of a trial enrolling humans is unethical when the equipoise level is beyond 80% (80:20 distribution of uncertainty). IRB members require a higher level of equipoise when it comes to testing a new drug in humans than in animals. A relatively high level of equipoise is needed for IRB members to be comfortable to approve trials involving life-threatening situations, children and elderly patients.",,['NOTNLM'],"['Ethical committees.', 'ethics', 'randomized controlled trial']",PMC3804473,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we show that exogenously expressed mouse Dnmt3a proteins harboring the corresponding R878 mutations largely fail to mediate DNA methylation in murine embryonic stem (ES) cells but are capable of interacting with wild-type Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b. Coexpression of the Dnmt3a R878H (histidine) mutant protein results in inhibition of the ability of wild-type Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b to methylate DNA in murine ES cells.

Epub 2013 Oct 28.,,"OBJECTIVE: The etiology of childhood cancers is largely unknown. Studies have suggested that birth characteristics may be associated with risk. Our goal was to evaluate the risk of childhood cancers in relation to fetal growth. METHODS: We conducted a case-control study nested within Nordic birth registries. The study included cancer cases diagnosed in Denmark, Finland, Norway, and Sweden among children born from 1967 to 2010 and up to 10 matched controls per case, totaling 17,698 cases and 172,422 controls. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) were derived from conditional logistic regression. RESULTS: Risks of all childhood cancers increased with increasing birth weight (P trend </= .001). Risks of acute lymphoid leukemia and Wilms tumor were elevated when birth weight was >4000 g and of central nervous system tumors when birth weight was >4500 g. Newborns large for gestational age were at increased risk of Wilms tumor (OR: 2.1 [95% CI: 1.2-3.6]) and connective/soft tissue tumors (OR: 2.1 [95% CI: 1.1-4.4]). In contrast, the risk of acute myeloid leukemia was increased among children born small for gestational age (OR: 1.8 [95% CI: 1.1-3.1]). Children diagnosed with central nervous system tumors at <1 year of age had elevated risk with increasing head circumference (P trend < .001). Those with head circumference >39 cm had the highest risk (OR: 4.7 [95% CI: 2.5-8.7]). CONCLUSIONS: In this large, Nordic population-based study, increased risks for several childhood tumors were associated with measures of fetal growth, supporting the hypothesis that tumorigenesis manifesting in childhood is initiated in utero.",,['NOTNLM'],"['Nordic countries', 'birth weight', 'childhood cancer', 'fetal growth', 'nested case-control study']",PMC3813399,,,['MR/K006525/1/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom'],,,,,,,,,

METHODS: HUVECs were co-cultured with TcpC secreting wild-type E. coli strain CFT073 (TcpC(wt)) or tcpc gene-deleted CFT073 mutant strain (TcpC(mut)) in transwell system,respectively. Apoptosis of HUVECs was analyzed by Annexin-V/PI double staining. Mitochondrial membrane depolarization was detected by JC-1 staining. Expression of apoptosis-related proteins in HUVECs was determined by Western blot. RESULTS: HUVECs showed morphological changes after co-cultured with TcpC(wt) for 24 h: the cells became detached and cell debris increased,and cell number was also decreased when compared to HUVECs co-cultured with TcpC(mut). The apoptosis of HUVEC cells co-cultured with TcpC(wt) for 24 h significantly increased,compared to that of control group and TcpC(mut) group (60.1% 9.7% compared with 9.0% 1.3% and 16.9% 0.4%,respectively, P<0.05); meanwhile the mitochondrial depolarization of HUVECs co-cultured with TcpC(wt) was significantly increased,compared to that in control and TcpC(mut) groups (64.5% 0.9% compared with 14.5% 2.1% and 15.6% 3.3%, respectively,P<0.05). Cleavage of PARP and inhibition of Mcl-1 and XIAP expression were seen in HUVECs co-cultured with TcpC(wt),but not in groups of control and TcpC(mut). CONCLUSION: TcpC secreted from CFT073 can induce apoptosis of HUVECs through mitochondrial pathway, in which PARP is cleaved and Mcl-1 and XIAP expressions are inhibited.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In megakaryocyte-erythrocyte progenitor cells (MEP), intracellular ROS levels were found to be as low as those in hematopoietic stem cells (HSC). In contrast, remarkably high intracellular ROS levels were observed in granulocyte-monocyte progenitor cells. Intracellular ROS levels in common myeloid progenitors (CMP) were inversely correlated with their MEP differentiation potential. Moreover, gene set enrichment analysis revealed that ROS-low CMP showed gene expression patterns similar to those of MEP, indicating that intracellular ROS levels mark the fate of CMP. In in vitro assays, ROS significantly suppressed the generation of MEP and the formation of megakaryocyte-erythrocyte colonies from CMP. In ROS-high CMP, expression of colony-stimulating factor one receptor (CSF1R) was highly upregulated, and its surface expression correlated with their granulocyte-monocyte differentiation potential. Furthermore, ROS was found to induce the expression of CSF1R mRNA in a leukemia cell line.

ZAP-70 overexpression is considered a surrogate marker of a B-CLL cell subset. To test whether the differential biological characteristics of these patients also include the T helper population, we studied naive, non-terminated memory (NTEM), terminated memory (TEM) and central memory (CM) cells, and cytokine expression by CD4 T lymphocytes from ZAP-70(+) and ZAP-70(-) B-CLL patients. METHODS: Expression of CD3, CD8, CD45RA, CD27, and CD28 antigens and intracytoplasmic cytokine production (IFNgamma, IL-2, IL-4, IL-10, and TNFalpha) were assessed simultaneously by nine-color flow-cytometry in peripheral blood lymphocytes from B-CLL patients. B cell ZAP-70 expression in B-CLL cells was also analyzed by flow cytometry. RESULTS: Compared to ZAP-70(-) B-CLL patients, ZAP-70(+) B-CLL patients showed 1) significant reduction in the naive T helper subset and expansion of NTEM and TEM subsets, 2) a decrease in the percentage of activated CD4 T lymphocytes expressing IFNgamma, TNFalpha, and IL-2, and 3) an increase in the percentage of CD4 T lymphocytes expressing IL-4 or IL-10.

Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) that target BCR-ABL1 are now the standard of care for patients with CML. Molecular monitoring of residual BCR-ABL1 mRNA transcripts, typically performed using real-time quantitative PCR, has improved treatment management, particularly for patients with CML in chronic phase. Major molecular response (MMR; i.e., a >/=3-log reduction in BCR-ABL1 transcript levels) is used in current treatment guidelines to assess prognosis. Recent evidence suggests that deeper molecular responses (>/=4-log reductions in BCR-ABL1 transcript levels), particularly when attained early during treatment, may have even better correlation with long-term outcomes, including survival and disease progression. Furthermore, achieving deep molecular response is a requirement for entering trials evaluating treatment-free remission (TFR). In this review, we discuss the evolving definition of minimal residual disease and the various levels of molecular response under evaluation in current clinical studies. In addition, the available clinical data on achieving MMR and deeper levels of molecular response with TKI therapy, the prognostic value of deep molecular response, and factors that may predict a patient's ability to achieve and sustain a deep molecular response on TKI therapy are also discussed. Available data from TFR studies are addressed. We discuss current knowledge of the ideal conditions for attempting treatment discontinuation, factors predictive of molecular relapse, when TKI therapy should be restarted, and which therapeutic strategies (when administered in the first-line setting and beyond) are expected to best enable successful TFR.",['(c)2013 AACR.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To gain insight into these issues, we evaluated a series of 1001 CLL cases with reliable classic cytogenetic data obtained within 6 months from diagnosis before any treatment. Overall, 320 cases were found to carry >/= 1 CTRAs. The most frequent chromosome breakpoints were 13q, followed by 14q, 18q, 17q, and 17p; notably, CTRAs involving chromosome 13q showed a wide spectrum of translocation partners. KC (>/= 3 aberrations) was detected in 157 cases and significantly (P < 0.005) associated with unmutated IGHV genes and aberrations of chromosome 17p. Furthermore, it was identified as an independent prognostic factor for shorter time-to-first-treatment. CTRAs were assigned to two categories (i) CTRAs present in the context of KC, often with involvement of chromosome 17p aberrations, occurring mostly in CLL with unmutated IGHV genes; in such cases, we found that KC rather than the presence of CTRAs per se negatively impacts on survival; (ii) CTRAs in cases without KC, having limited if any impact on survival. On this evidence, we propose that all CTRAs in CLL are not equivalent but rather develop by different processes and are associated with distinct clonal behavior.","['Copyright (c) 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the interaction between LICs and normal hematopoietic cells at the early phase has not been clearly delineated because of the lack of a suitable experimental model. In this study, we succeeded in causing a marked leukocytosis resembling CML from restricted foci of LICs in the normal hematopoietic system by direct transplantation of BCR-ABL gene-transduced LICs into the bone marrow (BM) cavity of nonirradiated mice. Herein, we observed that BCR-ABL(+)lineage(-)c-kit(-) immature leukemia cells produced high levels of an inflammatory chemokine, MIP-1alpha/CCL3, which promoted the development of CML.

Despite this, one third of patients with N/F-mutated T-ALL experienced relapse. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In a series of 212 adult T-ALLs included in the multicenter randomized GRAALL-2003 and -2005 trials, we searched for additional N/K-RAS mutations and PTEN defects (mutations and gene deletion). RESULTS: N/F mutations were identified in 143 (67%) of 212 patients, and lack of N/F mutation was confirmed to be associated with a poor prognosis. K-RAS, N-RAS, and PTEN mutations/deletions were identified in three (1.6%) of 191, 17 (8.9%) of 191, and 21 (12%) of 175 patients, respectively. The favorable prognostic significance of N/F mutations was restricted to patients without RAS/PTEN abnormalities. These observations led us to propose a new T-ALL oncogenetic classifier defining low-risk patients as those with N/F mutation but no RAS/PTEN mutation (97 of 189 patients; 51%) and all other patients (49%; including 13% with N/F and RAS/PTEN mutations) as high-risk patients. In multivariable analysis, this oncogenetic classifier remained the only significant prognostic covariate (event-free survival: hazard ratio [HR], 3.2; 95% CI, 1.9 to 5.15; P < .001; and overall survival: HR, 3.2; 95% CI, 1.9 to 5.6; P < .001). CONCLUSION: These data demonstrate that the presence of N/F mutations in the absence of RAS or PTEN abnormalities predicts good outcome in almost 50% of adult T-ALL. Conversely, the absence of N/F or presence of RAS/PTEN alterations identifies the remaining cohort of patients with poor prognosis.",,,,,,"['ClinicalTrials.gov/NCT00222027', 'ClinicalTrials.gov/NCT00327678']",,,,,,,,,,

However, the function of cyclic AMP response element modulator-1 (CREM-1), one member of the CREB family, is still with limited acquaintance. To investigate whether CREM-1 is involved in RGCs death, we performed a light-induced retinal damage model in adult rats. Upregulation of CREM-1 was observed in retina after light-induced damage by performing western blot. Immunofluorescent labeling indicated that upregulated CREM-1 was localized mainly in the RGCs. We also investigated co-localization of CREM-1 with active-caspase-3 and TUNEL (apoptotic markers) in the retina after light-induced damage. In addition, the expression patterns of B cell lymphoma/leukemia-2 and Bcl-2 associated X protein were parallel with that of CREM-1. Collectively, we hypothesized upregulation of CREM-1 in the retina was associated with RGCs death after light-induced damage.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Patients with iAMP21 are older (median age 9 years) with a low white cell count. Previously, we demonstrated a high relapse risk when these patients were treated as standard risk. Recent studies have shown improved outcome on intensive therapy. In view of these treatment implications, accurate identification is essential. Here we have studied the cytogenetics and outcome of 530 iAMP21 patients that highlighted the association of specific secondary chromosomal and genetic changes with iAMP21 to assist in diagnosis, including the gain of chromosome X, loss or deletion of chromosome 7, ETV6 and RB1 deletions. These iAMP21 patients when treated as high risk showed the same improved outcome as those in trial-based studies regardless of the backbone chemotherapy regimen given.

NOC-induced mitochondrial apoptotic events including Bak activation, Deltapsim loss, cytochrome c release, and caspase cascade activation were blocked by Bcl-2 overexpression. However, mitotic arrest, Cdc25C activation, upregulation of cyclin B1 levels, Cdk1 activation, Bcl-2 phosphorylation at Thr-56 and Ser-70, and Bim phosphorylation were retained. The treatment of Jurkat T cells concomitantly with NOC and the G1/S-blocking agent hydroxyurea resulted in G1/S arrest and complete abrogation of all apoptotic events. The association of Bcl-2 with Bim or Bak declined after the prometaphase arrest-dependent phosphorylation of Bcl-2 and Bim, whereas the association of Bcl-2 with Bax remained relatively constant. Although Bax was redistributed from the cytosol to the mitochondria, resulting in an increase in the mitochondrial level of Bax following NOC treatment, the subcellular localization of Bcl-2, Bim, Bak and apoptosis-inducing factor was confined to the mitochondrial fraction irrespective of NOC treatment. Experiments using selective caspase inhibitors showed that mitochondria-dependent activation of caspase-9 and -3 was crucial for NOC-induced apoptosis. NOC-induced phosphorylation of Bcl-2 and Bim, Deltapsim loss, and mitochondria-dependent apoptotic events were significantly suppressed by a Cdk1 inhibitor roscovitine, but not by the JNK inhibitor SP600125 or the p38 MAPK inhibitor SB203580. These results show that the prometaphase arrest-dependent phosphorylation of Bcl-2 and Bim, which was mediated by Cdk1, could reduce the association of Bcl-2 with Bak or Bim to allow Bak activation and mitochondrial apoptotic events in Jurkat T cells exposed to NOC.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Vitamin D levels were evaluated in 97 consecutive, newly diagnosed, intensively treated patients with AML. MicroRNA expression profiles and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the 25(OH) vitamin D3 pathway genes were evaluated and correlated with 25(OH) vitamin D3 levels and treatment outcome. RESULTS: Thirty-four patients (35%) had normal 25(OH) vitamin D3 levels (32-100 ng/mL), 34 patients (35%) had insufficient levels (20-31.9 ng/mL), and 29 patients (30%) had deficient levels (<20 ng/mL). Insufficient/deficient 25(OH) vitamin D3 levels were associated with worse relapse-free survival (RFS) compared with normal vitamin D3 levels. In multivariate analyses, deficient 25(OH) vitamin D3 , smoking, European Leukemia Network genetic group, and white blood cell count retained their statistical significance for RFS. Several microRNAs and SNPs were associated with 25(OH) vitamin D3 levels, although none remained significant after multiple test corrections; one 25(OH) vitamin D3 receptor SNP, rs10783219, was associated with a lower complete remission rate (P = .0442) and with shorter RFS (P = .0058) and overall survival (P = .0011). CONCLUSIONS: It remains to be determined what role microRNA and SNP profiles play in contributing to low 25(OH) vitamin D3 level and/or outcome and whether supplementation will improve outcomes for patients with AML.",['(c) 2013 American Cancer Society.'],['NOTNLM'],"['acute myeloid leukemia', 'microRNA', 'outcome', 'single nucleotide polymorphism', 'vitamin D']",PMC3948325,,,"['P30 CA016056/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA16056/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",['NIHMS519944'],,,,,,,,

In this study, umbilical cord-derived mesenchymal stem cells (UCMSCs) were isolated from Wharton's jelly and cryopreserved in the UCMSCs bank. Compared with BMMSCs, we found that UCMSCs had superior proliferative potential. We found that NOD/SCID mice cotransplanted with CB and UCMSCs demonstrated significant human CD45(+) cell engraftment compared with those transplanted with CB alone. Then, 20 patients with high-risk leukemia were prospectively randomized to either receive cotransplantation of CB and ex vivo expanded banked UCMSCs or to receive CBT alone. No serious adverse events were observed in the patients receiving UCMSC infusion. The time to undergo neutrophil engraftment and platelet engraftment was significantly shorter in the eight patients receiving cotransplantation than that in the 12 patients receiving CBT alone (p=0.003 and p=0.004, respectively). Thus, application of ex vivo expanded banked UCMSCs in humans appears to be feasible and safe. UCMSCs can enhance engraftment after CBT, but further studies are warranted.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To improve the prognosis of patients with NSCLCs, new and validated therapeutic targets are critically needed. In this study, we focused on F-box and WD repeat domain containing-7 (FBXW7), an E3 ubiquitin ligase, that regulates the degradation of MCL1, Myc, cyclin E, and TOP2A. Importantly, loss of FBXW7 was associated with increased sensitivity of tumors to a class I-specific histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor, MS-275. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed increased expression of FBXW7 targets, MCL1 and TOP2A, in NSCLC tumors with low expression of FBXW7. Moreover, clinical specimens exhibiting low FBXW7 expression presented with more progressive cancer and significantly shorter cancer-specific survival than patients with high FBXW7 expression. Mechanistic study of NSCLC cell lines with silenced FBXW7 revealed enhanced MS-275 sensitivity and taxol resistance. Interestingly, taxol resistance was eliminated by MS-275 treatment, suggesting the potential of HDAC inhibitors for the treatment of aggressive taxol-resistant NSCLCs that lack FBXW7. IMPLICATIONS: FBXW7 status impacts chemosensitivity and is a prognostic marker in NSCLCs.

However, development of more efficient and convenient method is still demanded. Homologous DNA assembly methods, which do not depend on restriction enzymes, have been used as convenient tools for cloning and have been applied to site-directed mutagenesis recently. This study describes an optimized homologous DNA assembly method, termed as multiple patch cloning (MUPAC), for multiple site-directed and saturation mutagenesis. RESULTS: To demonstrate MUPAC, we introduced five back mutations to a mutant green fluorescent protein (GFPuv) with five deleterious mutations at specific sites and transformed Escherichia coli (E. coli) with the plasmids obtained. We observed that the over 90% of resulting colonies possessed the plasmids containing the reverted GFPuv gene and exhibited fluorescence. We extended the test to introduce up to nine mutations in Moloney Murine Leukemia Virus reverse transcriptase (M-MLV RT) by assembling 11 DNA fragments using MUPAC. Analysis of the cloned plasmid by electrophoresis and DNA sequencing revealed that approximately 30% of colonies had the objective mutant M-MLV RT gene. Furthermore, we also utilized this method to prepare a library of mutant GFPuv genes containing saturation mutations at five specific sites, and we found that MUPAC successfully introduced NNK codons at all five sites, whereas other site remained intact. CONCLUSIONS: MUPAC could efficiently introduce various mutations at multiple specific sites within a gene. Furthermore, it could facilitate the preparation of experimental gene materials important to molecular and synthetic biology research.",,,,PMC3829206,,,,,,,,,,,,

The experimental arm consisted of high-dose cytarabine and L-asparaginase, while the standard arm consisted of standard-dose cytarabine, oral 6-mercaptopurine and cyclophosphamide. The probabilities of event-free survival at 8 years in the experimental and standard arms were 72.3 +/- 3.7% and 77.5 +/- 3.5%, respectively (P = 0.32). The 8-year overall survival rates for these two arms were 85.0 +/- 3.0% and 86.9 +/- 2.8%, respectively (P = 0.72).

The disease is typically cha-racterized by heterogeneous clinical behavior ranging from indolent course to rapidly progressive disease. Using clinical and bio-logical factors we can stratify patients with CLL and prospectively identify those who can be expected unfavorable course. There is a special group known as ultra highrisk chronic lymphocytic leukemia with an extremely poor prognosis. These are about 10- 15% of all patients with CLL. They do not respond to standard treatment and their survival is short with a median of 2- 3 years. For highrisk patients are considered: patients with a proven TP53 defect, refractory to purine analogues or with early relapse after chemoimmunotherapy based on fludarabine ( 24 months). While the standard 1st line treatment protocol in younger patients is chemoimmunotherapy FCR, in case of ultra highrisk CLL other methods like allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation or clinical trials testing the new drugs should be considered. In particular, allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation is a very promising treatment modality that offers longterm disease control and cure regardless of the unfavorable CLL subtype. Transplantation treatment should be therefore considered in all younger patients with ultra highrisk CLL, who should be without delay referred to a center for intensive hematological treatment.",,,,,,,,,Vysoce rizikova chronicka lymfocytarni leukemie - charakteristika a lecebne moznosti.,,,,,,,

These paradoxical effects of arsenic may be dose-dependent, associated with its distinctive metabolism, or correlated with its direct or indirect effects on different cellular pathways which may result in altered cellular functions. The basic mechanism through which As2O3 induces molecular remission in APL patients include direct targeting of PML and retinoic acid receptor alpha fusion protein (PML-RARalpha) by arsenic resulting in oncoprotein degradation leading to partial differentiation. Many in vitro studies have also indicated that the anticancer properties of As2O3 against non-APL blood cancers predominantly occur through induction of apoptotic pathway. Especially, release of cytochrome c or activation of the caspase cascades and apoptosis-related proteins by arsenic is thought to occur by directly targeting mitochondria. The mechanisms and the selective target sites that have been usually associated with the cytotoxic effects of arsenicals are discussed here with reference to their contribution towards the anticancer properties of arsenic. In this review we have particularly explained the in vivo or in vitro arsenic toxicity based on arsenic metabolic pathway and its different metabolites. These multiple effects and different selective target sites for arsenic and its metabolites emphasize the need for better understanding of paradoxical effects of arsenic which may provide the appropriate use of this agent in the treatment of various malignancies.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In primitive hematopoietic precursors, it activates or represses important genes via recruitment of various epigenetic factors such as DNA methyltransferases, and histone deacylases. Here, we demonstrate that LSD1, a histone lysine demethylase, also participates in the trans-repressive effects of SALL4. Based on luciferase assays, the amine oxidase domain of LSD1 is important in suppressing SALL4-mediated reporter transcription. In freshly isolated adult mouse bone marrows, both SALL4 and LSD1 proteins are preferentially expressed in undifferentiated progenitor cells and co-localize in the nuclei. Further sequential chromatin immunoprecipitation assay confirmed that these two factors share the same binding sites at the promoter regions of important hematopoietic regulatory genes including EBF1, GATA1, and TNF. In addition, studies from both gain- and loss-of-function models revealed that SALL4 dynamically controls the binding levels of LSD1, which is accompanied by a reversely changed histone 3 dimethylated lysine 4 at the same promoter regions. Finally, shRNA-mediated knockdown of LSD1 in hematopoietic precursor cells resulted in altered SALL4 downstream gene expression and increased cellular activity. Thus, our data revealed that histone demethylase LSD1 may negatively regulate SALL4-mediated transcription, and the dynamic regulation of SALL4-associated epigenetic factors cooperatively modulates early hematopoietic precursor proliferation.",,['NOTNLM'],"['Bone Marrow', 'DNA Methylation', 'Hematopoiesis', 'Hematopoietic Progenitor', 'Histone Demethylation', 'Mi-2.NuRD Complex', 'Repressor Protein', 'SALL Family', 'Stem Cells']",PMC3843083,,,"['R01 HL087948/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL090589/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01HL087948/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,

Targeting the niche is a new strategy to eliminate persistent and drug-resistant LSCs. CD44 (refs. 3,4) and interleukin-6 (ref. 5) have been implicated previously in the LSC niche. Transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1) is released during bone remodeling and plays a part in maintenance of CML LSCs, but a role for TGF-beta1 from the BMM has not been defined. Here, we show that alteration of the BMM by osteoblastic cell-specific activation of the parathyroid hormone (PTH) receptor attenuates BCR-ABL1 oncogene-induced CML-like myeloproliferative neoplasia (MPN) but enhances MLL-AF9 oncogene-induced AML in mouse transplantation models, possibly through opposing effects of increased TGF-beta1 on the respective LSCs. PTH treatment caused a 15-fold decrease in LSCs in wild-type mice with CML-like MPN and reduced engraftment of immune-deficient mice with primary human CML cells. These results demonstrate that LSC niches in CML and AML are distinct and suggest that modulation of the BMM by PTH may be a feasible strategy to reduce LSCs, a prerequisite for the cure of CML.",,,,PMC3827980,,,"['U54 CA163191/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL044851/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL089747/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'AR060221/AR/NIAMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA090576/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'K01AG036744/AG/NIA NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 EB014703/EB/NIBIB NIH HHS/United States', 'DP2 OD008466/OD/NIH HHS/United States', 'K08 CA138916-02/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R21AR060689/AR/NIAMS NIH HHS/United States', 'K01 AG036744/AG/NIA NIH HHS/United States', 'K08 CA138916/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 CA009216/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA148180/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R21 AR060689/AR/NIAMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AR060221/AR/NIAMS NIH HHS/United States']",['NIHMS520277'],,,,,,,,

We analyzed expression of the C/EBPalpha signature in a cohort of 525 patients with acute myeloid leukemia and identified a subset characterized by low expression of this signature. We referred to this group of patients as the C/EBPalpha dysfunctional subset. Remarkably, a large percentage of samples harboring C/EBPalpha biallelic mutations clustered within this subset. We hypothesize that re-activation of the C/EBPalpha signature in the C/EBPalpha dysfunctional subset could have therapeutic potential. In search for small molecules able to reverse the low expression of the C/EBPalpha signature we applied the connectivity map. This analysis predicted positive connectivity between the C/EBPalpha activation signature and histone deacetylase inhibitors. We showed that these inhibitors reactivate expression of the C/EBPalpha signature and promote granulocytic differentiation of primary samples from the C/EBPalpha dysfunctional subset harboring biallelic C/EBPalpha mutations.

METHODS: Patients received simvastatin orally at MTD for 7 days during a 21-day cycle for 6 cycles. Blood samples were collected during cycle 1. Simvastatin lactone and carboxylate concentrations were measured in plasma and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) using a validated HPLC-MS/MS assay. RESULTS: Patients accrued to this study showed high variability in their exposure to simvastatin. Exposure was dose proportional (AUC and C max) as compared to those receiving standard hyperlipidemia therapy. Peak plasma concentrations ranged from 0.08 to 2.2 and from 0.03 to 0.6 muM for simvastatin lactone and carboxylate, respectively. CONCLUSION: Our study shows that when simvastatin is administered at its MTD, only low micro-molar concentrations are achieved in plasma and PBMCs, which is consistent with the results observed in previous studies with lovastatin, but far lower than the concentrations required for anticancer effects in vitro. However, whether simvastatin at its MTD can confer therapeutic benefits to patients still remains to be determined.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We therefore analyzed patients from the randomized CML study IV to investigate disease manifestations and outcome in different age groups. One thousand five hundred twenty-four patients with BCR-ABL-positive chronic phase CML were divided into four age groups: (1) 16-29 years, n = 120; (2) 30-44 years, n = 383; (3) 45-59 years, n = 495; and (4) >/=60 years, n = 526. Group 1 (adolescents and young adults (AYAs)) presented with more aggressive disease features (larger spleen size, more frequent symptoms of organomegaly, higher white blood count, higher percentage of peripheral blasts and lower hemoglobin levels) than the other age groups. In addition, a higher rate of patients with BCR-ABL transcript levels >10 % on the international scale (IS) at 3 months was observed. After a median observation time of 67.5 months, no inferior survival and no differences in cytogenetic and molecular remissions or progression rates were observed.

We screened 14,718 compounds in a leukemia-stroma co-culture system for inhibition of cobblestone formation, a cellular behavior associated with stem-cell function. Among those compounds that inhibited malignant cells but spared HSPCs was the cholesterol-lowering drug lovastatin.

We therefore sought to discover a reliable marker for selection of the most potent Ags. To this end, (1) we immunized mice against 8 individual Ags: 4 minor histocompatibility Ags (miHAs) and 4 leukemia-associated Ags (LAAs) that were overexpressed on leukemic relative to normal thymocytes; (2) we assessed their ability to reject EL4 leukemic cells; and (3) we correlated the properties of our Ags (and their cognate T cells) with their ability to induce protective antileukemic responses. Overall, individual miHAs instigated more potent antileukemic responses than LAAs. Three features had no influence on the ability of primed T cells to reject leukemic cells: (1) MHC-peptide affinity; (2) the stability of MHC-peptide complexes; and (3) epitope density at the surface of leukemic cells, as assessed using mass spectrometry. The cardinal feature of successful Ags is that they were recognized by high-avidity CD8 T cells that proliferated extensively in vivo. Our work suggests that in vitro evaluation of functional avidity represents the best criterion for selection of Ags, which should be prioritized in clinical trials of leukemia immunotherapy.","['Copyright (c) 2014 American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation.', 'Published by Elsevier Inc.

We previously reported that andrographolide suppressed v-Src-mediated cellular transformation by promoting the degradation of Src. In the present study, we demonstrated the involvement of Hsp90 in the andrographolide-mediated inhibition of Src oncogenic activity. Using a proteomics approach, a cleavage fragment of Hsp90alpha was identified in andrographolide-treated cells. The concentration- and time-dependent induction of Hsp90 cleavage that accompanied the reduction in Src was validated in RK3E cells transformed with either v-Src or a human truncated c-Src variant and treated with andrographolide. In cancer cells, the induction of Hsp90 cleavage by andrographolide and its structural derivatives correlated well with decreased Src levels, the suppression of transformation, and the induction of apoptosis. Moreover, the andrographolide-induced Hsp90 cleavage, Src degradation, inhibition of transformation, and induction of apoptosis were abolished by a ROS inhibitor, N-acetyl-cysteine. Notably, Hsp90 cleavage, decreased levels of Bcr-Abl (another known Hsp90 client protein), and the induction of apoptosis were also observed in human K562 leukemia cells treated with andrographolide or its active derivatives. Together, we demonstrated a novel mechanism by which andrographolide suppressed cancer malignancy that involved inhibiting Hsp90 function and reducing the levels of Hsp90 client proteins.

Epub 2013 Oct 24.,,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: The role of bone marrow-mesenchymal stem cells (BM-MSC) in leukaemic cell control is controversial. The purpose of this work was to evaluate BM-MSC role regarding the viability, proliferation and immunophenotype of normal B-cell precursors from control (Ct) patients and leukaemic cells from B-acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (B-ALL) patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: BM-MSC were isolated and characterised from voluntary donors. Mononuclear cells isolated from Ct and B-ALL bone marrow samples were cultured in the presence or absence of BM-MSC for 7days. Cell viability was determined with LIVE/DEAD and proliferation index evaluated by CFSE labelling. Cell population immunophenotypes were characterised by estimating CD19, CD10, CD20 and CD45 antigens by flow cytometry. RESULTS: After co-culture, B-ALL cells exhibited higher viability (20-40%) as compared to just cells (3-10%). Ct and B-ALL absolute cell counts were higher in the presence of BM-MSC (Ct: 25/mm(3)cf8/mm(3), B-ALL: 15/mm(3)cf3/mm(3)). Normal B-cell subpopulations in co-culture had increased expression of CD19 and CD10 (Pre-pre B) and CD45 and CD20 antigens (Pre-B). B-ALL cells co-cultured with BM-MSC showed an increase in CD19 and CD20, although the greatest increase was observed in the CD10 antigen. CONCLUSIONS: Lymphoid cell maintenance, at early stages of differentiation, was significantly promoted by BM-MSC in normal and leukaemic cells. Co-cultures also modulated the expression of antigens associated with the B-ALL asynchronous phenotype as CD10 co-expressed with CD19 and CD20. To our knowledge, this is the first time that CD10, CD19 and CD20 leukaemic antigens have been reported as being regulated by BM-MSC.","['Copyright (c) 2013 King Faisal Specialist Centre & Research Hospital.

Lead, cadmium and zinc leaf concentrations in our study were over the concentrations allowed by the statutory limit set for metal(oid) contents in vegetables. The accessions were non genotoxic at the different concentrations studied, although one of the accessions showed the highest mutation rates doubling those of negative control. The cytotoxicity assays with HL60 human leukaemia cells showed that the tumouricide activities of rocket leaves decreased with the increasing of metal(oid) concentrations and also with the decreasing of glucosinolate concentrations in their tissues. An interaction between metal(oid)s and glucosinolate degradation products contained in rocket leaves is suggested as the main modulator agents of the biological activity of the plants grown in metal-contaminated soils.",['Copyright (c) 2013.

While Gag proteins from several different retroviruses have been purified for study in vitro, there has yet to be a report of successful purification of deltaretroviral Gag. In this paper, we report the cloning, expression and purification of full-length bovine leukemia virus (BLV) Gag from Escherichia coli using a combination of polyethyleneimine precipitation, ammonium sulfate precipitation, and affinity chromatography. Experiments using size-exclusion chromatography were also performed to analyze the oligomeric state of the Gag protein in solution, and results suggest that it exists primarily as a monomer but may oligomerize into higher-order complexes to a small extent. Molecular weight estimation by comparison of elution volume to a set of protein standards supports the hypothesis that BLV Gag adopts a slightly extended conformation in solution.

We aimed to estimate the cases of childhood leukaemia that might be attributable to exposure to ELF MF in the European Union (EU27), if the associations seen in epidemiological studies were causal. We estimated distributions of ELF MF exposure using studies identified in the existing literature. Individual distributions of exposure were integrated using a probabilistic mixture distribution approach. Exposure-response functions were estimated from the most recently published pooled analysis of epidemiological data. Probabilistic simulation was used to estimate population attributable fractions (AFP) and attributable cases of childhood leukaemia in the EU27. By assigning the literature review-based exposure distribution to all EU27 countries, we estimated the total annual number of cases of leukaemia attributable to ELF MF at between ~50 (95% CIs: -14, 132) and ~60 (95% CIs: -9, 610), depending on whether exposure-response was modelled categorically or continuously, respectively, for a non-threshold effect. This corresponds to between ~1.5% and ~2.0% of all incident cases of childhood leukaemia occurring annually in the EU27. Considerable uncertainties are due to scarce data on exposure and the choice of exposure-response model, demonstrating the importance of further research into better understanding mechanisms of the potential association between ELF MF exposure and childhood leukaemia and the need for improved monitoring of residential exposures to ELF MF in Europe.",['(c) 2013.

SAMHD1 activity is blocked by the Vpx accessory function present in human immunodeficiency virus type 2 and SIVsm.

EBV expresses different genes that are associated with three latency types. To date, as many as 44 EBV-encoded miRNA species have been found, but their comprehensive profiles in the three types of latent infection that are associated with various types of tumors are not well documented. METHODS: In the present study, we utilized poly (A)-tailed quantitative real-time RT-PCR in combination with microarray analysis to measure the relative abundances of viral miRNA species in a subset of representative lymphoid and epithelial tumor cells with various EBV latency types. RESULTS: Our findings showed that the miR-BHRF1 and miR-BART families were expressed differentially in a tissue- and latency type-dependent manner. Specifically, in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) tissues and the EBV-positive cell line C666-1, the miR-BART family accounted for more than 10% of all detected miRNAs, suggesting that these miRNAs have important roles in maintaining latent EBV infections and in driving NPC tumorigenesis. In addition, EBV miRNA-based clustering analysis clearly distinguished between the three distinct EBV latency types, and our results suggested that a switch from type I to type III latency might occur in the Daudi BL cell line. CONCLUSIONS: Our data provide a comprehensive profiling of the EBV miRNA transcriptome that is associated with specific tumor cells in the three types of latent EBV infection states. EBV miRNA species represent a cluster of non-encoding latency biomarkers that are differentially expressed in tumor cells and may help to distinguish between the different latency types.",,,,PMC4231337,,,,,,,,,,,,

In vitro cytotoxic assays suggested an initial trend toward hypoxia-related resistance in the first 24 h, but evaluation at later time points (48-72 h) clearly showed that there was no relevant difference in drug response when comparing hypoxic and normal oxygen level conditions. Modulation of mRNA expression of several hypoxia-related genes was also observed after hypoxic exposure in a cell specific manner, suggesting that HIF1A mRNA expression could play a different role in specific subtypes of leukemia. Despite the remaining questions regarding hypoxia-mediated mechanisms, these findings could be helpful to provide new insights into the role of hypoxia in childhood ALL.",,['NOTNLM'],"['ALL', 'Hypoxia', 'gene expression profile', 'treatment outcome']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

FLT3 mutations are frequently observed in APL, but its prognostic significance remains unclear. We analyzed 245 newly diagnosed adult patients with APL treated on intergroup trial C9710 and evaluated previously defined biological and prognostic factors and their relationship to FLT3 mutations and to additional karyotypic abnormalities. FLT3 mutations were found in 48% of patients, including 31% with an internal tandem duplication (FLT3-ITD), 14% with a point mutation (FLT3-D835) and 2% with both mutations. The FLT3-ITD mutant level was uniformly low, < 0.5. Neither FLT3 mutation had an impact on remission rate, induction death rate, DFS or overall survival (OS). The addition of ATO consolidation improved outcomes regardless of FLT3 mutation type or level, initial white blood cell count, PML-RARA isoform type or transcript level. The presence of a complex karyotype was strongly associated with an inferior OS independently of post-remission treatment. In conclusion, the addition of ATO to frontline therapy overcomes the impact of previously described adverse prognostic factors including FLT3 mutations.

This phenolic ester was further investigated for its in vitro cytotoxicity toward human CCRF-CEM leukemia cells and their multi-drug resistant (MDR) subline, CEM/ADR5000. The intrinsic mitochondrial membrane potential (DeltaPsim) and induction of apoptosis by this isolate were evaluated. METHODS: Chromatography techniques, mass spectrometry and proton NMR were employed to isolate Maldi 531.2[M + H]+. XTT cell proliferation and viability assay was used for cytotoxic test, and JC-1[5',5',6,6',-tetrachloro-1,1',3,3'-tetraethylbenzimidazoyl carbocyanine iodide was used to assess DeltaPsim and initiation of apoptosis; Annexin V/FITC-PI staining was employed to analyse apoptosis. RESULTS: Maldi 531.2[M + H]+ was cytotoxic towards both CCRF-CEM and CEM/ADR5000 cells with IC50 values of 0.02 and 0.03 muM, respectively. The mitochondrial membrane potential (DeltaPsim) of MDR cells was significantly reduced in a dose-dependent manner leading to apoptosis as detected by flow cytometric Annexin V-FITC/ PI staining. CONCLUSION: Maldi 531.2[M + H]+ may be a potential anti-cancer drug candidate whose mode of action include reduction of the mitochondrial membrane potential and induction of apoptosis.",,,,PMC3816152,,,,,,,,,,,,

Genome-wide Affymetrix SNP array 6.0 was used for genotyping in discovery set (n = 118). After identifying significant SNPs for overall survival (OS) in single SNP analysis, a risk model was constructed. Out of 632 957 autosomal SNPs analysed, finally four SNPs (rs2826063, rs12791420, rs11623492 and rs2575369) were introduced into the risk model. The model could stratify the patients according to their OS in discovery set (P = 1.053656 x 10-4). Replication was performed using Sequenom platform for genotyping in the validation cohort (n = 129). The model incorporated with clinical and four SNP risk score was successfully replicated in a validation set (P = 5.38206 x 10-3). The integration of four SNPs and clinical factors into the risk model showed higher area under the curve (AUC) reults than in the model incorporating only clinical or only four SNPs, suggesting improved prognostic stratification power by combination of four SNPs and clinical factors. In conclusion, a genome-wide SNP-based risk model in 247 patients with AML-NK can identify a group of high risk patients with poor survival.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In order to facilitate the cloning of sequences from JHKV, a series of partially degenerate consensus retroviral PCR primers were created by a data-driven design approach based on an alignment of 14 diverse gammaretroviral genomes. These primers were used in the PCR amplification of purified JHK virion cDNA, and ana lysis of the resulting amplified sequence indicates that the JHKV is in the murine leukemia virus (MLV) family. The JHK sequence is nearly identical to the corresponding region of the Bxv-1 endogenous mouse retrovirus (GenBank accession AC115959) and distinct from XMRV. JHKV gag-specific amplification was demonstrated with nucleic acids from uncultivated, frozen, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of the index patient, but not in PBMCs from nine healthy blood donors. Unlike earlier reports, in which MLV-like sequences were identified in human source material, which may have been due to murine contamination, budding retrovirions were demonstrated repeatedly by electron microscopy in uncultivated lymphocytes of the index patient that were morphologically identical in their development to the virions in the JHK-3 cells, and immunological evidence was obtained that the index patient produced IgG antibodies that bound to the budding viral particles in patient PBMCs and in the JHK-3 cells. These data indicate that the patient had been infected by JHKV, lending significance to the demonstration of JHKV amplicons in nucleic acids of the patient's PBMCs.

The specificity of both tax-2 and pol-2 assays was verified by testing the DNA extracted from C10, a chronically HTLV-1-infected cell line, used as a negative control. As far as HTLV-2 assay, the specificity was checked by testing C344 cells which are stably infected by HTLV-2. Quantitative determination of HTLV PVLs was obtained by performing standard reference curves by a serial dilution of DNA extracted from C10 and C344 cells, assuming one proviral genome per C10 cell and two per C344 cell. The human albumin gene, of which there are 2 copies per cell, was quantified in the same reactions to normalize the results. Intra-assay reproducibility was checked by running 30 replicates of the same sample in a plate (coefficient of variance <6 %), while inter-assay reproducibility was measured by amplifying the same sample in three independent experiments (coefficient of variance <6 %).",,,,,,,,,,,,,['Methods Mol Biol. 2014;1087:E1'],,,

HTLV-2 shares many similarities with HTLV-1, but displays lower or absent association to diseases. Among the proteins encoded by HTLVs, the viral transactivator Tax exerts an essential role in viral transcription as well as in cell transformation. Different experimental methods to study Tax activity on HTLV-LTR promoter and Tax subcellular distribution are described.

Although a significant number of patients with refractory or relapsed disease will achieve remission, long-term survival rates remain poor, and efforts to identify therapies which will improve OS are under continuous investigation. The current fundamental goal of such investigation is the achievement of as complete a remission as possible without dose-limiting toxicities, and the progression to hematopoietic stem cell transplantation thereafter.

We tested the hypothesis that assessment of creatinine clearance (CrCl) and/or serum Cr may be a suitable means of monitoring plasma MTX concentrations. METHODS: All children in the study had ALL or NHL, were in complete remission, and received HDMTX (3 or 5 g/m(2))+leucovorin. Plasma MTX concentrations were measured at 24, 48, and 96 h. CrCl was determined at 24 and 48 h. Correlations between 24- and 48-h plasma MTX concentrations and CrCl and serum Cr concentrations were determined. CrCl and serum Cr concentrations were compared over time between children who had delayed and non-delayed MTX elimination. RESULTS: A total of 105 children were included. There were significant negative correlations between CrCl at 24 and 48 h and plasma MTX concentrations at 24 (both p < 0.001) and 48 h (both p < 0.001). There were significant positive correlations between serum Cr concentrations at both 24 and 48 h and plasma MTX concentrations at 24 (both p < 0.001) and 48 h (both p < 0.001). There were 88 (30.2 %) instances of elimination delay. Children with elimination delay had significantly lower CrCl and higher Cr concentrations at 24 and 48 h compared with children without elimination delay (all p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that, with further refinement, assessment of renal function may be a useful means of monitoring plasma MTX concentrations during HDMTX for ALL and NHL.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These compounds can also mediate immune-modulatory effects that may contribute to their anticancer effects. However, HDACi can also induce anti-inflammatory, and potentially immunosuppressive, outcomes. We therefore sought to clarify the role of the immune system in mediating the efficacy of HDACi in a physiologic setting, using preclinical, syngeneic murine models of hematologic malignancies and solid tumors. We showed an intact immune system was required for the robust anticancer effects of the HDACi vorinostat and panobinostat against a colon adenocarcinoma and two aggressive models of leukemia/lymphoma. Importantly, although HDACi-treated immunocompromised mice bearing established lymphoma succumbed to disease significantly earlier than tumor bearing, HDACi-treated wild-type (WT) mice, treatment with the conventional chemotherapeutic etoposide equivalently enhanced the survival of both strains. IFN-gamma and tumor cell signaling through IFN-gammaR were particularly important for the anticancer effects of HDACi, and vorinostat and IFN-gamma acted in concert to enhance the immunogenicity of tumor cells. Furthermore, we show that a combination of vorinostat with alpha-galactosylceramide (alpha-GalCer), an IFN-gamma-inducing agent, was significantly more potent against established lymphoma than vorinostat treatment alone. Intriguingly, B cells, but not natural killer cells or CD8(+) T cells, were implicated as effectors of the vorinostat antitumor immune response. Together, our data suggest HDACi are immunostimulatory during cancer treatment and that combinatorial therapeutic regimes with immunotherapies should be considered in the clinic.",['(c)2013 AACR.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A member of the mRNA export complex, THOC5 (suppressors of the transcriptional defects of hpr1 delta by overexpression complex 5) is a substrate for several tyrosine kinases such as macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF) receptor and various leukemogenic tyrosine kinases, such as Bcr-Abl, or NPM-ALK. THOC5 tyrosine phosphorylation is elevated in stem cells from patients with chronic myeloid leukemia, suggesting that THOC5 may be involved in leukemia development. THOC5 is also an essential element in the maintenance of hematopoiesis in adult mice. In this report, we show that THOC5 is located in the nuclear speckles, and that it is translocated from the nucleus to cytoplasm during M-CSF-induced bone marrow-derived macrophage differentiation. Furthermore, we have identified THOC5 target genes by trancriptome analysis, using tamoxifen-inducible THOC5 knockout macrophages. Although only 99 genes were downregulated in THOC5-depleted macrophages, half of the genes are involved in differentiation and/or migration. These include well-known regulators of myeloid differentiation inhibitor of DNA binding (Id)1, Id3, Smad family member 6 (Smad6) and Homeobox (Hox)A1. In addition, a subset of M-CSF-inducible genes, such as Ets family mRNAs are THOC5 target mRNAs. Upon depletion of THOC5, unspliced v-ets erythroblastosis virus E26 oncogene homolog (Ets1) mRNA was accumulated in the nucleus. Furthermore, THOC5 was recruited to chromatin where Ets1 was transcribed and bound to unspliced and spliced Ets1 transcripts, indicating that THOC5 has a role in processing/export of M-CSF-inducible genes.

Epub 2013 Oct 22.,,"Over the last few decades, study of cancer in mouse models has gained popularity. Sophisticated genetic manipulation technologies and commercialization of these murine systems have made it possible to generate mice to study human disease. Given the large socio-economic burden of cancer, both on academic research and the health care industry, there is a need for in vivo animal cancer models that can provide a rationale that is translatable to the clinic. Such a bench-to-bedside transition will facilitate a long term robust strategy that is economically feasible and clinically effective to manage cancer. The major hurdles in considering mouse models as a translational platform are the lack of tumor heterogeneity and genetic diversity, which are a hallmark of human cancers. The present review, while critical of these pitfalls, discusses two newly emerging concepts of personalized mouse models called ""Mouse Avatars"" and Co-clinical Trials. Development of ""Mouse Avatars"" entails implantation of patient tumor samples in mice for subsequent use in drug efficacy studies. These avatars allow for each patient to have their own tumor growing in an in vivo system, thereby allowing the identification of a personalized therapeutic regimen, eliminating the cost and toxicity associated with non-targeted chemotherapeutic measures. In Co-clinical Trials, genetically engineered mouse models (GEMMs) are used to guide therapy in an ongoing human patient trial. Murine and patient trials are conducted concurrently, and information obtained from the murine system is applied towards future clinical management of the patient's tumor. The concurrent trials allow for a real-time integration of the murine and human tumor data. In combination with several molecular profiling techniques, the ""Mouse Avatar"" and Co-clinical Trial concepts have the potential to revolutionize the drug development and health care process. The present review outlines the current status, challenges and the future potential of these two new in vivo approaches in the field of personalized oncology.",['Copyright (c) 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Enzymes of bacterial origin are used as therapeutic agents for the treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Recently, the structure of a human homolog, hASNase3, which possesses l-asparaginase activity, was solved setting the basis for the development of an anti-leukemic protein drug of human origin. Being an N-terminal hydrolase, hASNase3 undergoes intramolecular self-cleavage generating two protomers (subunits alpha and beta) which remain non-covalently associated and constitute the catalytically active form of the enzyme. However, recombinant expression of full-length hASNase3 in Escherichiacoli results in only partial processing towards the active enzyme. We developed a co-expression system for the two subunits that allowed production of the beta-subunit complexed to the alpha-subunit such that the N-terminal methionine is removed by endogenous methionine aminopeptidase to expose the catalytically essential threonine residue at the N-terminus of the beta-subunit. The enzyme produced by this co-expression strategy is fully active, thus obviating the necessity of self-activation by slow autoproteolytic cleavage.",['Copyright (c) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

The B-cell receptor signaling pathway is being actively explored as a therapeutic target in CLL. Ibrutinib, an inhibitor of Bruton's tyrosine kinase is showing impressive responses in heavily pre-treated high-risk CLL, whether alone or in combination with MoAbs or chemotherapy. Other key components of the BCR pathway, namely PI3K-delta, are also being targeted with novel therapies with promising results as well. Future trials would likely evaluate ibrutinib in the front-line setting. Moreover, improvements in allogeneic HCT mostly by continuing to reduce associated toxicity as well as incorporating cellular therapies such as autologous CLL tumor vaccines, among others, will continue to expand. This is also the case for the next generation of chimeric antigen receptor therapy for CLL once genetically modified T cells are available at broad scale and with improved efficacy. As our ability to further refine and integrate these therapies continues to improve, and we gain further knowledge from gene sequencing, we anticipate that treatment algorithms will continue to be revised to a more personalized approach to treat this disease with improved efficacy and devoid of unnecessary toxicity.",,,,,,,['P30 CA016672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,

We identified four novel cytotoxic compounds (IC50 values: compound 1, 24.96+/-12.37 muM; compound 2, 22.82+/-4.20 muM; compound 3, 3.86+/-1.64 muM and compound 5, 40.62+/-10.07 muM, compared to DATTS: IC50: 9.33+/-3.86 muM). These polysulfanes possess excellent differential toxicity, as they did not affect proliferating mononuclear blood cells from healthy donors. We further demonstrated ability of active compounds to induce apoptosis in leukemia cells by analysis of nuclear fragmentation and of cleavage of effector and executioner caspases. Apoptosis was preceded by accumulation of cells in G2/M phase with a pro-metaphase-like nuclear pattern as well as microtubular alterations.

We show that IL-1beta mRNA and the active processed form of IL-1beta are abundant in inflammatory acne lesions. Moreover, we identify P. acnes as a trigger of monocyte-macrophage NLRP3-inflammasome activation, IL-1beta processing and secretion that is dependent on phagocytosis, lysosomal destabilization, reactive oxygen species, and cellular K+ efflux. In mice, inflammation induced by P. acnes is critically dependent on IL-1beta and the NLRP3 inflammasome of myeloid cells. These findings show that the commensal P. acnes-by activating the inflammasome-can trigger an innate immune response in the skin, thus establishing the NLRP3-inflammasome and IL-1beta as possible therapeutic targets in acne.",,,,,,,,,,['J Invest Dermatol. 2014 Mar;134(3):595-7.

We speculated that the individual shape of the cells, which is linked to cytoskeletal structure and pre-stress, might tune these integrin-dependent mechanotransduction events. To this aim, fibronectin circles, squares and rectangles of identical surface area (2000mum(2)) were micro-contact printed onto elastomeric substrates. Fibroblasts plated on these patterns occupied the corresponding shapes. Cyclic 10% equibiaxial strain was applied to patterned cells for 30min, and changes in cytoskeleton and cell-matrix adhesions were quantified after fluorescence staining. After strain, megakaryocytic leukemia-1 protein translocated to the nucleus in most cells, indicating efficient RhoA activation independently of cell shape. However, circular and square cells (with radial symmetry) showed a significantly greater increase in the number of actin stress fibers and vinculin-positive focal adhesions after cyclic strain than rectangular (bipolar) cells of identical size. Conversely, cyclic strain induced larger changes in pY397-FAK positive focal complexes and zyxin relocation from focal adhesions to stress fibers in bipolar compared to symmetric cells. Thus, radially symmetric cells responded to cyclic strain with a larger increase in assembly, whereas bipolar cells reacted with more pronounced reorganization of actin stress fibers and matrix contacts. We conclude that integrin-mediated responses to external mechanical strain are differentially modulated in cells that have the same spreading area but different geometries, and do not only depend on mere cell size.",['(c) 2013.'],['NOTNLM'],"[""4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole"", 'Actin cytoskeleton', 'BSA', 'Bovine Serum Albumin', 'Cell shape', 'Cyclic strain', 'DAPI', 'DMEM', ""Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium"", 'ECM', 'FAK', 'FCS', 'Focal adhesion', 'HMDS', 'LIM', 'MEFs', 'MKL-1', 'Micro-contact printing', 'PBS', 'PDMS', 'ROCK', 'Ras homolog gene family, member A', 'Rho-associated Protein Kinase', 'RhoA', 'SRF', 'TRITC', 'extracellular matrix', 'fetal calf serum', 'focal adhesion kinase', 'hexamethyldisiloxane', 'lin-11, Isl-1 and mec-3', 'megakaryocytic leukemia-1', 'mouse embryonic fibroblasts', 'phosphate-buffered saline', 'polydimethylsiloxane', 'serum response factor', 'tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Non-human primates infected with simian T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (STLV-1) are considered to constitute a suitable animal model for HTLV-1 research. However, the function of the regulatory and accessory genes of STLV-1 has not been analyzed in detail. In this study, STLV-1 in naturally infected Japanese macaques was analyzed. RESULTS: We identified spliced transcripts of STLV-1 corresponding to HTLV-1 tax and HTLV-1 bZIP factor (HBZ). STLV-1 Tax activated the NFAT, AP-1 and NF-kappaB signaling pathways, whereas STLV-1 bZIP factor (SBZ) suppressed them. Conversely, SBZ enhanced TGF-beta signaling and induced Foxp3 expression. Furthermore, STLV-1 Tax activated the canonical Wnt pathway while SBZ suppressed it. STLV-1 Tax enhanced the viral promoter activity while SBZ suppressed its activation. Then we addressed the clonal proliferation of STLV-1(+) cells by massively sequencing the provirus integration sites. Some clones proliferated distinctively in monkeys with higher STLV-1 proviral loads. Notably, one of the monkeys surveyed in this study developed T-cell lymphoma in the brain; STLV-1 provirus was integrated in the lymphoma cell genome. When anti-CCR4 antibody, mogamulizumab, was administered into STLV-1-infected monkeys, the proviral load decreased dramatically within 2 weeks. We observed that some abundant clones recovered after discontinuation of mogamulizumab administration. CONCLUSIONS: STLV-1 Tax and SBZ have functions similar to those of their counterparts in HTLV-1.

Thus, we evaluated these patterns and responses to imatinib in CP-CML patients. METHODS: This retrospective study, based on the Georgia Cancer Specialists' electronic medical record (EMR) system, identified CP-CML patients initiating treatment with imatinib from 01/01/2002 to 11/01/2011 who were subsequently followed for >/=6 months. RESULTS: A total of 177 patients met the study criteria. Imatinib dose modification occurred in 59 patients (33%). Rates of treatment interruption, discontinuation, and switching to another therapy were 16%, 24%, and 23%, respectively. Of 27 patients discontinuing imatinib for lack of efficacy, 9 (33%) had initial dose escalation; 26 patients (96%) eventually switched to a second-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitor. By 3 months, 168 patients remained on imatinib, of whom 96 (57%) had undergone cytogenetic and/or molecular testing. The frequency of response monitoring fluctuated over time, with rates as high as 28% for cytogenetic and 69% for molecular testing. Cumulative response rates steadily increased; 18 month rates were 47% for complete cytogenetic response and 26% for major or complete molecular response. There were no cases of progression and/or death among 38 patients who were regularly monitored for molecular response within the first 12 months of imatinib. Ten of 98 patients (10%) not regularly monitored had progressed or died. CONCLUSIONS: Almost one-third of patients initiating imatinib for CP-CML required dose modification, treatment interruption, or discontinuation. Opportunities for improved monitoring in this setting were identified. Limitations include those inherent to retrospective analyses based on EMR and the uncertain extrapolability of the results.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Their antiviral activity can be mediated by at least two cytotoxic pathways, namely the granule exocytosis pathway, involving perforin and granzymes, and the Fas-FasL pathway. It was shown that the level of Friend retrovirus (FV) replication determines the cytotoxic pathway for the control of viral infection. In low-level infection only the Fas pathway is active, whereas cytotoxic molecules are not produced. In the current study, we elucidate the role of CD4(+) regulatory T cells (Tregs) in suppressing the exocytosis pathway during an asymptomatic low-level infection. FINDINGS: We show that even a low-level retrovirus infection induced a strong activation and proliferation of natural Tregs. The expanded Tregs suppressed the proliferation of virus-specific CD8(+) T cells and the production of cytotoxic molecules by these cells. Not surprisingly, the in vivo killing activity of these CD8(+) T cells was rather weak. Selective depletion of Foxp3(+) Tregs resulted in de novo granzyme production and augmented virus-specific in vivo killing, but did not affect the low-level virus replication. CONCLUSIONS: Expanded natural Tregs determined the cytotoxic pathways of virus-specific effector CD8(+) T cells during the acute phase of retroviral infection.",,,,PMC4015423,,,,,,,,,,,,

Metaphase cytogenetics and FISH testing for -5/5q-, -7/7q-, 20q-,+8, and -Y were performed in 50 bone marrow samples obtained from patients with MDS diagnosed according to the WHO criteria (2008). Evolution from MDS to AML was followed up for each patient.

The low rate of progression to acute leukemia in the IPSS poor prognosis group might be associated with the high rate of allogeneic hematopoietic stem transplantation. It is concluded that there is higher detectable rate for detecting a certain chromosome by FISH probe than that by metaphase cytogenetics, especially for detecting low clone chromosomal abnormalities and mitotic figures less than 20. There is no difference between IPSS good prognosis group and IPSS poor prognosis group in our study probably because of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The results showed that the expression of erythroid and non-erythroid cells increased at the same time. The myeloid antigens mainly expressed CD13/CD33/CD117/CD34, while the erythroid antigens expressed Gly and CD71. The karyotypic detection indicated that there were 1 case with normal karyotype, 3 cases with simple karyotypic abnormality and 2 cases with complex karyotypic abnormality, the other cases were not detected. The molecular biological detection found that the poor prognosis gene existed in 5 cases [38.5% (5/13)], including 3 cases with MLL-MLL fusion gene, 1 case with MLL mutation, and 1 cases with NRAS gene mutation, the abnormal genes were not detected in remainder 8 cases.

The PBMNC were induced in vitro by IL-23 (50 ng/ml) alone or IL-23 combined with IL-2 (100 U/ml) for 72 h, and then were co-cultured with leukemia cell line K562. The CCK-8 method was used to detect the effect of PBMNC induced at different times on K562 cells, the ELISA was performed for detecting IFN-gamma level in culture supernatant, and the perforin and granzymes B were detected by RQ-PCR.

Murine (CD45.2) primary hematopoietic precursor positively selected for expression of the progenitor marker c-Kit by means of MACS were transduced with a retrovirus carrying MLL-AF9 fusion gene. After cultured in vitro, the transduced cells were injected intravenously through the tail vein into the lethally irradiated mice (CD45.1). PCR, flow cytometry and morphological observation were employed to evaluate the murine leukemia model system. The results showed that MLL-AF9 fusion gene was expressed in the infected cells, and the cells had a dramatically enhanced potential to generate myeloid colonies with primitive and immature morphology. Flow cytometric analysis revealed that the immortalized cells highly expressed myeloid lineage surface markers Gr-1 and Mac-1. Moreover, the expression levels of Hoxa9 and Meis1 mRNA were significantly higher in the MLL-AF9 cells than that in control. The mice transplanted with MLL-AF9 cells displayed typical signs of leukemia within 6-12 weeks. Extensive infiltration leukemic cells was observed in the Wright-Giemsa stained peripheral blood smear and bone marrow, and also in the histology of liver and spleen. Flow cytometric analysis of the bone marrow and spleen cells demonstrated that the CD45.2 populations expressed highly myeloid markers Gr-1 and Mac-1. The leukemic mice died within 12 weeks.

The clinical characteristics, results of morphology, immunology, cytogenetics and molecular genetic detections and results of follow-up in 15 adult patients with Ph(+)MPAL were analyzed retrospectively. The results showed that 15 patients among 87 cases of MPAL demonstrated Ph(+)MPAL (17.2%; 15/87) (7 males and 8 females), their median age was 51 (range 16-81) year old and median WBC count at diagnosis was 69 (12.7-921)x10(9)/L. Based on FAB criteria, these patients showed different morphologic types, including AML (13.3%; 2/15), ALL (40.0%; 6/15), HAL (46.7%; 7/15). Immunologic analysis indicated that 15 cases of Ph(-)MPAL were all classified as B-lymphoid +myeloid mixed immunophenotype. Except one patient, all expressed CD34 antigen on the surface of leukemia cells with 64.3% strong positive, only Ph (53.3%; 8/15), Ph with additional chromosomal abnormalities (33.3%; 5/15) and normal karyotype (13.3%; 2/15) were cytogenetically identified. BCR-ABL fusion gene transcript positive were detected by multiplex reverse transcription PCR in all cases, with e1a2 subtype (p190) (40.0%; 6/15) and b2a2 or b3a2 (p210) subtype (60.0%; 9/15). Four out of 7 (57.1%) patients were found to have IKZF1 gene deletion, without other common gene mutations. Seven out of 10 cases (70.0%) achieved complete remission (CR) after one cycle of induction chemotherapy. In the induction stage, CR rate seemed higher when tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) were added to chemotherapy (83.3%:50.0%; P = 0.206). Overall survival (OS) in 4 patients received allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) was longer than that in 4 patients received chemotherapy alone (P = 0.004). It is concluded that Ph(+)MPAL mainly is expressed as B+My phenotype. The majority of patients is older and has CD34 overexpression. In the aspect of molecular genetics, the Ph(+)MPAL is similar to other acute leukemia with Ph chromosome. Ph(+)MPAL is a subtype of acute leukemia with poor prognosis. WBC count at diagnosis is an independent prognostic factor. The combination of TKI and allo-HSCT can improve their long-term survival, which needs to be confirmed through carrying out a prospective and multicenter clinical trial for newly diagnosed Ph(+)MPAL.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Despite a strong understanding of the role noise plays in synthetic biological systems, it remains unclear how propagation of expression heterogeneity in an endogenous regulatory network is distributed and utilized by cells transitioning through a key developmental event. RESULTS: Here we investigate the temporal dynamics of a single-cell transcriptional network of 45 transcription factors in THP-1 human myeloid monocytic leukemia cells undergoing differentiation to macrophages. We systematically measure temporal regulation of expression and variation by profiling 120 single cells at eight distinct time points, and infer highly controlled regulatory modules through which signaling operates with stochastic effects. This reveals dynamic and specific rewiring as a cellular strategy for differentiation. The integration of both positive and negative co-expression networks further identifies the proto-oncogene MYB as a network hinge to modulate both the pro- and anti-differentiation pathways. CONCLUSIONS: Compared to averaged cell populations, temporal single-cell expression profiling provides a much more powerful technique to probe for mechanistic insights underlying cellular differentiation. We believe that our approach will form the basis of novel strategies to study the regulation of transcription at a single-cell level.",,,,PMC4015031,,,,,,,,,,,,

Combined treatment activates caspases 8, 9 and 3, which correlate with caspase-induced PARP cleavage. These effects are associated with a marked increase in activation of the stress-related MAP kinases p38MAPK and JNK. Interestingly, combined treatment induces a marked decrease in the total and phosphorylated Bcr-Abl protein levels, and inhibits signaling pathways downstream of Bcr-Abl: downregulation of STAT3 and STAT5 phosphorylation and/or total levels and a decrease in phosphorylation of the Bcr-Abl-associated proteins CrkL and Lyn. Moreover, we found that other mitotic inhibitors (Vincristine and Docetaxel), in combination with bortezomib, also suppress the Bcr-Abl-induced pro-survival signals and result in caspase 3 activation.

MicroRNAs have been implicated in the pathogenesis of GBM, but a high-throughput analysis of their role in GIC differentiation has not been reported. We have established human GIC cell lines that can be efficiently differentiated into cells expressing astrocytic and neuronal lineage markers. Using this in vitro system, a microarray-based high-throughput analysis to determine global expression changes of microRNAs during differentiation of GICs was performed. A number of changes in the levels of microRNAs were detected in differentiating GICs, including over-expression of hsa-miR-21, hsa-miR-29a, hsa-miR-29b, hsa-miR-221 and hsa-miR-222, and down-regulation of hsa-miR-93 and hsa-miR-106a. Functional studies showed that miR-21 over-expression in GICs induced comparable cell differentiation features and targeted SPRY1 mRNA, which encodes for a negative regulator of neural stem-cell differentiation. In addition, miR-221 and miR-222 inhibition in differentiated cells restored the expression of stem cell markers while reducing differentiation markers. Finally, miR-29a and miR-29b targeted MCL1 mRNA in GICs and increased apoptosis.

Dpf3 expression was induced upon IL-3 stimulation in Ba/F3 cells, while strong binding of both STAT5a and STAT5b was detected in its promoter. Reduced expression of Dpf3 was detected in Ba/F3 cells with Stat5a and Stat5b knock-down, suggesting that this gene is positively regulated by STAT5, upon IL-3 stimulation. Furthermore, this gene was significantly up-regulated in CLL patients, where DPF3 gene/protein up-regulation and strong STAT5 binding to the DPF3 promoter, correlated with increased STAT5 activation, mainly in non-malignant myeloid cells (granulocytes). Our findings provide insights in the STAT5 dependent transcriptional regulation of Dpf3, and demonstrate for the first time increased STAT5 activation in granulocytes of CLL patients.

We used a human monocytic cell line, THP-1, and dendritic cells to study the mechanism of p30 and p12/p8 requirements in these cell types. p30 inhibited the expression of interferon (IFN)-responsive genes (ISG) following stimulation by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) of Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) and by poly(I.C) of TLR3 but not of TLR7/8 with imiquimod. Results with THP-1 mirrored those for ex vivo human primary monocytes and monocyte-derived dendritic cells (Mo-mDC). The effect of p30 on TLR signaling was also demonstrated by ablating its expression within a molecular clone of HTLV-1. HTLV-1 infection of monocytes inhibited TLR3- and TLR4-induced ISG expression by 50 to 90% depending on the genes, whereas the isogenic clone p30 knockout virus was less effective at inhibiting TLR3 and TRL4 signaling and displayed lower infectivity. Viral expression and inhibition of ISG transcription was, however, rescued by restoration of p30 expression. A chromatin immunoprecipitation assay demonstrated that p30 inhibits initiation and elongation of PU.1-dependent transcription of IFN-alpha1, IFN-beta, and TLR4 genes upon TLR stimulation. In contrast, experiments conducted with p12/p8 did not demonstrate an effect on ISG expression. These results provide a mechanistic explanation of the requirement of p30 for HTLV-1 infectivity in vivo, suggest that dampening interferon responses in monocytes and DCs is specific for p30, and represent an essential early step for permissive HTLV-1 infection and persistence.",,,,PMC3911690,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, the cytotoxicity of borrelidin, a macrolide antibiotic with a high cytotoxic selectivity for proliferating endothelial cells and leukemia cells, was tested on malignant and non-malignant breast cells. Highly metastatic breast cancer cell lines (MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-435) showed promising results and exhibited good sensitivity to borrelidin at low nanomolar concentrations, but borrelidin was cytotoxic to a non-malignant breast epithelial cell line (MCF10A) as well. Furthermore, although a high sensitivity of endothelial cells (human umbilical vein endothelial cells; HUVEC) and individual leukemia cell lines (Jurkat and IM9) to borrelidin was confirmed in this study, another leukemia cell line (HL60) and an immortalized endothelial cell line (EA.hy926) displayed a significantly decreased sensitivity. Reduced sensitivity to borrelidin was associated with elevated bcl-2 expression in these cell lines. In conclusion, the results presented show that borrelidin displays high and selective cytotoxicity against subgroups of cancer cells and endothelial cells, but, owing to its non-specific toxicity to non-malignant cells, its clinical application might be restricted because of likely adverse effects and limited efficacy in bcl2-overexpressing cancer cells.","['Copyright (c) 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.']",['NOTNLM'],"['bcl-2', 'borrelidin', 'breast cancer', 'leukemia', 'neoangiogenesis']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although free of cancer, survivors are faced with a variety of chronic health problems including an increased risk of cardiovascular and metabolic abnormalities. The effect of cancer treatments on vascular structure and function in childhood cancer survivors (CCS) has not been examined. PROCEDURE: Measures of carotid artery stiffness (compliance and distensibility) and thickness (IMT), brachial artery endothelial-dependent dilation (EDD), and endothelial-independent dilation (EID) were obtained from ultrasound imaging in 319 CCS (age: 14.6 +/- 0.1 years; male/female: 112/96) who were >5 years from diagnosis and 208 (age: 13.6 +/- 0.2 years; male/female: 171/148) siblings who had never been diagnosed with cancer. Participants were 9-18 years of age at examination. RESULTS: Survivors of leukemia had lower carotid distensibility and compliance, indicating increased arterial stiffness, when compared to controls. There were no significant differences in measures of carotid stiffness or EDD in survivors of solid tumors and central nervous system (CNS) tumors compared to controls. EDD was lower in leukemia survivors than in controls, and EID was greater in survivors of CNS tumors than in controls. CONCLUSION: These results demonstrate that early in life, CCS have arterial changes indicating increased risk for premature atherosclerosis and cardiovascular disease. Therefore, it is reasonable to advocate that efforts should be directed at monitoring and managing cardiovascular risk factors in CCS.","['(c) 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']",['NOTNLM'],"['cancer survivors', 'children', 'compliance', 'distensibility', 'ultrasound']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Nevertheless, the contribution of p53 and Bim proteins in the CA-4-induced apoptosis in non-small lung cancer cells (NSCLC) remains unresolved, specifically on involving of p53 in the mitochondrial pathway activation by a transcription-independent mechanism. In this context, the p53-null H1299 and wt-p53 H460 NSCLC cells, in the absence and presence of pifithrin-micro (PFTmicro), an inhibitor of p53 mitochondrial-translocation, were treated with CA-4 and different cellular endpoints were analysed. In contrast to previous observations in H460 cells, CA-4 failed in the activation of an apoptotic response in H1299 cells, thus indicating an involvement of p53 in the cell death induced by the drug. We found that CA-4 led to p53 cellular re-localisation in H460 cells; in particular, p53 was released from the microtubular network and accumulated at mitochondria where it interacts with Bim protein and other proteins of the Bcl-2 (B-cell leukaemia-2) family, leading to cytochrome c release, alteration in the mitochondrial membrane polarisation, cell cycle arrest at the G2/M-phase, and cell death. Interestingly, the cytosolic and the mitochondrial accumulation of protein Bim was strictly dependent on p53 status. The extent of cell death was not reduced in H460 after combined treatment of PFTmicro with CA-4. Overall, the data support a model of CA-4-induced apoptosis in NSCLC, for which the expression of p53 protein is essential, but its mitochondrial function, linked to p53-transcription independent apoptosis pathway, is negligible.",['(c) 2013 International Federation for Cell Biology.'],['NOTNLM'],"['Bim protein', 'apoptosis', 'combretastatin A-4', 'mitochondrial p53', 'non-small-cell lung carcinoma']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Several recent studies have demonstrated that poor adherence to imatinib may hamper the therapeutic outcomes and result in increased medical expenditures, whilst research on exploring the reasons for non-adherence to imatinib is still limited. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to explore the experience of patients as they journey through their CML treatments and associated imatinib utilisation in order to understand the perceptions, attitudes and concerns that may influence adherence to imatinib treatment. SETTING: This study was conducted at oncology outpatient clinics in a medical centre in southern Taiwan. METHODS: CML patients who regularly attended the oncology outpatient clinics to receive imatinib treatment from October 2011 to March 2012 were invited to participate in the study. Semi-structured face-to-face interviews were used to explore patients' experiences and views of their treatment, their current CML status and CML-related health conditions, their concerns about imatinib treatment and imatinib-taking behaviours. Patient interviews were recorded, transcribed verbatim and thematically analysed using the constant comparison approach. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Themes related to patients' views of the disease and health conditions, worries and concerns influencing imatinib utilisation behaviours are reported. RESULTS: Forty-two CML patients participated in the interviews. The emerging themes included: acceptance of current disease and health status, misconceptions about disease progression, factors associated with adherence to imatinib, concerns and management of adverse drug effects. Participants regarded CML as a chronic disease but had misconceptions about disease progression, therapeutic monitoring, resistance to imatinib and symptoms of side effects. Participants were generally adherent to imatinib and favoured long-term prescriptions to avoid regular outpatient visits for medication refills. Experiencing adverse effect was the main reason influencing adherence and led to polypharmacy. Most participants altered medicine-taking behaviours to maintain long-term use of imatinib. CONCLUSION: Taiwanese CML patients are adherent to imatinib but report changing their medication-taking behaviour due to adverse drug effects and associated polypharmacy. Patients' misconceptions of the disease and medication suggests that it is necessary to improve communication between patients and healthcare professionals. Routinely providing updated information as part of the patient counselling process should be considered as a means of improving this communication.",,,,PMC3890041,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recent studies have shown that CTGF expression is elevated in precursor B-acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and that increased expression of CTGF is associated with inferior outcome in B-ALL. In this study, we characterized the functional role and downstream signaling pathways of CTGF in ALL cells. First, we utilized lentiviral shRNA to knockdown CTGF in RS4;11 and REH ALL cells expressing high levels of CTGF mRNA. Silencing of CTGF resulted in significant suppression of leukemia cell growth compared to control vector, which was associated with AKT/mTOR inactivation and increased levels of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p27.

The intent of the current study is to examine the associations between infant feeding practices and age at introduction of solids on risk of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Incident cases of infant and childhood (aged </=14 years) ALL (n = 142) were enrolled in a case-control study. Cases were frequency matched on age, sex, race, and ethnicity to two sets of controls (n = 284 total). Multivariable logistic regression was used to determine the association between infant feeding practices and age at the introduction of solids and the odds ratio of ALL. In adjusted multivariable analyses, each additional month of formula feeding was associated with a 1.17 (1.09-1.25) odds ratio; each additional month of age at introduction of solids was associated with a 1.18 (1.07-1.30) odds ratio. In this study, longer duration of formula feeding and later age at the introduction of solid foods were independently associated with increased risk of ALL. Additional studies are needed to address the factors influencing duration of formula feeding and delayed introduction of solids. The results support the potential role of energy balance in early life as a contributor to risk for pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We demonstrate that all paired FLIS and mFL cases were clonally related, based on IGH rearrangement patterns and BCL2 breakpoint sequences. FLIS and PFL had no or few secondary chromosomal imbalances detectable by array comparative genomic hybridization (FLIS 0.8 copy number alterations (CNA)/case; PFL 2.0 CNA/case; mFL 6.3 CNA/case) and a lower level of DNA methylation of genes recurrently de novo methylated in lymphomas, as compared with mFL. EZH2 Tyr641 mutations were detected in a subset of both FLIS (2/9) and PFL (1/3) cases. In conclusion, these findings provide evidence that FLIS represents a FL precursor lesion of long-lived clonal B cells carrying the t(14;18) with no or few secondary genetic changes.

Interestingly, these three miRNAs were downregulated in pediatric TCF3-rearranged B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (BCP-ALL). Here, we showed that individual or combined overexpression of miR-24, miR-126 and miR-365 can neither alter the cell cycle progression nor the amount of apoptosis in 697, KASUMI-2 or MHH-CALL-3 TCF3-rearranged leukemic cells. We further integrated the miRNA-mRNA expression data of 37 children with BCP-ALL to identify candidate target genes for these three miRNAs. However, the expression levels of selected candidate target genes (ELL, EBF3 and IRF4 for miR-24, PITPNC1 for miR-126 and ZAP-70 for miR-365) did not reduce upon miRNAs overexpression in MHH-CALL-3 TCF3-rearranged leukemic cells. Although the expression level of AURKB-a validated target for miR-24-was reduced upon miR-24 overexpression in hepatocarcinoma HEP-G2 cells, overexpression of miR-24 cannot alter AURKB expression levels in MHH-CALL-3 TCF3-rearranged leukemic cells.

However, MM patients evidence severe defects of humoral and cellular immunity, and it is likely that the profound immune dysregulation typical for this malignancy contributes to its eventual escape from natural immune control. One of the factors responsible for the immune dysfunction in MM might be the programmed death 1 (PD-1) protein. The physiological role of PD-1 is to guarantee T-cell homeostasis by limiting T-cell activation and proliferation. Accordingly, binding of the ligand PD-L1 to PD-1 expressed on the surface of activated T cells delivers an inhibitory signal, reducing cytokine production and proliferation. Using the same mechanism, PD-L1/PD-1 interactions have been shown in a number of animal models to confer tumor escape from immune control. Recently, clinical trials have suggested a significant therapeutic impact of PD-1/PD-L inhibition on a variety of solid tumors-for example, by the application of monoclonal antibodies. We show here that based on (1) the broad expression of PD-1 and its ligands in the microenvironment of myeloma, (2) data indicating an important role of the PD-1 pathway in the immune evasion by MM cells and (3) preclinical results providing a strong rationale for therapeutic PD-1/PD-L inhibition in this malignancy, MM may be very well suited for immunotherapy, for example, a monoclonal antibody, targeting PD-1 and/or its ligands.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Based on clinical and hematological parameters, two prognostic scoring systems, i.e., Hasford and Sokal index scoring systems are available to predict survival duration of CML patients on imatinib therapy. AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: Our study's objective is to compare Hasford score with Sokal index for the prognostication of de novo CML patients on therapy and find out new prognostic markers. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This is a retrospective study. The study population comprised 66 patients who were followed up for 60 months. For each patient, at presentation, scoring was performed as per Hasford and Sokal index and Philadelphia chromosome analysis was carried out by conventional cytogenetics. Thereafter, hematological parameters were assessed 3 monthly and conventional cytogenetics was done yearly. RESULTS: Out of these 66 patients, the number of patients belonging to low, intermediate and high risk categories are 21, 33 and 12 respectively by Hasford score and 12, 32 and 22 respectively by Sokal index. Eight patients, who had been categorized into high risk group by Sokal index but intermediate risk group by Hasford score, have shown better survival possibility as monitored by hematological and cytogenetic parameters. Ten cases, categorized into intermediate risk group by Sokal index but low risk group by Hasford score, is doing well till date. CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that Hasford score predicts survival of the patients better than Sokal index. However, multicentric study over a large population is needed to give the final verdict.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Meanwhile, multicolour flow cytometry (MFC) has received less attention because the so-called leukaemia-associated immunophenotypes (LAIPs) are generally of lower sensitivity and specificity, and prone to change during therapy. To improve MRD assessment by MFC, we here evaluate the combination of human Myeloid Inhibitory C-type Lectin (hMICL, also termed C-type lectin domain family 12, member A, CLEC12A) and CD 123 (also termed interleukin-3 receptor alpha, IL3RA) in combination with CD34 and CD117 (KIT), as an MRD assay in pre-clinical and clinical testing in 69 AML patients. Spiking experiments revealed that the assay could detect MRD down to 10(-4) in normal bone marrow with sensitivities equalling those of validated qPCR assays. Moreover, it provided at least one MFC MRD marker in 62/69 patients (90%). High levels of hMICL/CD123 LAIPs at the post-induction time-point were a strong prognostic marker for relapse in patients in haematological complete remission (P < 0.001). Finally, in post induction samples, hMICL/CD123 LAIPs were strongly correlated (r = 0.676, P = 0.0008) to applied qPCR targets. We conclude the hMICL/CD123-based MFC assay is a promising MRD tool in AML.","['(c) 2013 The Authors.

Accordingly, the natural history of the diseases has changed, and patients in complete molecular response now have the same life expectancy of their healthy coetaneous. Notwithstanding these results, approximately 20 - 30% of patients do not respond optimally to TKIs therapy, and most of these patients are potential candidates to progress toward the accelerated or blastic phase of the disease. Unfortunately, patients who become resistant to both first- and second-generation TKIs develop BCR-ABL kinase domain mutations, against which TKIs have extremely low cross-activity. In particular, none of the TKIs, with the exception of ponatinib, has significant activity against T315 mutation, which is estimated to be present in approximately 15 - 20% of patients carrying BCR-ABL mutations. The use of omacetaxine mepesuccinate/homoharringtonine for the treatment of TKI-resistant CML patients regained interest due to its mechanism of action independent of binding to the ATP-binding pocket. Therefore, the activity of this compound is independent from the presence of BCR-ABL1 mutations, which makes it an attractive option for the treatment of CML patients after TKI failure.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Six compounds exerted significant activity against HL60 promyelocytic leukemia cells with IC50 in low micromolar range (4-18 muM) and three compounds displayed activity against MDA-MB231 breast cancer cells (25-37 muM). In vitro cytotoxicity on normal cells PBMC (human peripheral blood mononuclear cells) was also evaluated. Compounds 7e (p-NO2, S) and 7m (p-COOCH3, S) showed good antiproliferative activity against HL60 (4 and 5 muM) and MDA-MB231 (37 and 25 muM) without affecting lymphocyte proliferation in PBMC, indicating low toxicity to normal cells. Besides, compound 7e induced DNA fragmentation on about 100% of HL60 cells at 50 muM. In this case, it was more potent than 7m and lead 1.

METHODS: Construction of quantum dots-RGD probe as photosensitizer for integrin-targeted photodynamic therapy was accomplished. After cells were treated with photodynamic therapy (PDT), the proliferation of SW1990 cells were measured by methyl thiazolyl tetrazolium assay. Morphologic changes, cell cycle retardance and apoptosis were observed under fluoroscope and flow cytometry. The expression of myeloid cell leukemia-1 (Mcl-1), protein kinase B (Akt) and tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) mRNA were detected by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. The amount of reactive oxygen species were also evaluated by fluorescence probe. RESULTS: The photodynamic therapy with quantum dots-RGD probe as photosensitizer significantly inhibited cell proliferation (P < 0.01). Apoptotic cells and morphologic changes could be found under optical microscope. The FCM revealed PDT group had more significant cell apoptosis rate compared to control cells (F = 130.617, P < 0.01) and cell cycle G0/G1 and S retardance (P < 0.05) compared to control cells. The expression of Mcl-1 and Akt mRNA were down-regulated, while expression of TRAIL mRNA was up-regulated after cells treated with PDT. PDT group had more significant number of cells producing reactive oxygen species compared to control cells (F = 3262.559, P < 0.01). CONCLUSION: The photodynamic therapy with quantum dots-RGD probe as photosensitizer significantly inhibits cell proliferation and increases apoptosis in SW1990 cells.",,['NOTNLM'],"['Apoptosis', 'Pancreatic carcinoma', 'Photodynamic therapy', 'Reactive oxygen species', 'Targeted probe']",PMC3801369,,,,,,,,,,,,

Two most commonly used methods for residual disease monitoring are real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction and multiparameter flow cytometry. The results so far are very promising, whereby it is likely that minimal residual disease results will enable to guide future post-remission treatment strategies. However, the leukemic clone may change between diagnosis and relapse due to the instability of the tumor cells. This instability may already be evident at diagnosis if different subpopulations of tumor cells coexist. Such tumor heterogeneity, which may be reflected by immunophenotypic, molecular, and/or cytogenetic changes, can have important consequences for minimal residual disease detection, since false-negative results can be expected to be the result of losses of aberrancies used as minimal residual disease markers. In this review the role of such changes in minimal residual disease monitoring is explored. Furthermore, possible causes of tumor instability are discussed, whereby the concept of clonal selection and expansion of a chemotherapy-resistant subpopulation is highlighted. Accordingly, detailed knowledge of the process of clonal evolution is required to improve both minimal residual disease risk stratification and patient outcome.",['(c) 2013 Clinical Cytometry Society.'],['NOTNLM'],"['acute myeloid leukemia', 'clonal evolution', 'flow cytometry', 'minimal residual disease', 'phenotypic changes', 'quantitative polymerase chain reaction']",,,,,,,['Cytometry B Clin Cytom. 2014 Jan;86(1):15-7.

By appropriate parameterisation of the model, we show how the risks to all specific first-degree kinships can be estimated and formally compared using simple interaction terms and how the model can be extended to accommodate higher-degree relatives. The correlation due to observations from family members and from the potential for repeated observations is accommodated by a robust sandwich variance estimator or a bootstrap estimate. Hazard ratios for different kinships are formally compared using a robust Wald test. We illustrate the method with applications to studies of adult leukemia and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma in the Swedish population and display our results on a pedigree diagram. Our estimates are consistent with published work that used simpler stratified methods, and our model enabled the detection of a number of statistically significant effects of kinship.

With the use of single-agent tyrosine kinase inhibitors, median overall survival ranges between 7 and 11 months. METHODS: The outcome was analyzed for 42 patients with lymphoid BP-CML who were treated with hyperfractionated cyclophosphamide, vincristine, Adriamycin, dexamethasone (HCVAD) plus imatinib or dasatinib. RESULTS: Complete hematological response was achieved in 90% of patients, complete cytogenetic remission in 58%, and complete molecular remission in 25%. Flow cytometry minimal residual disease negativity was achieved by 42% of evaluable patients after induction. Eighteen patients received allogeneic stem cell transplant (SCT) while in first complete hematological response. Median remission duration was 14 months and was longer among SCT recipients (P = .01) on multivariate analysis. Median overall survival was 17 months (range, 7-27 months) and was longer among SCT recipients (P < .001) and patients treated with dasatinib (P = .07) on multivariate analysis.

Cdc25A is an essential regulator of cycle progression and checkpoint response. Over-expression of Cdc25A occurs often in human cancers. In this study, we show that Rocaglamide-A (Roc-A), a natural anticancer compound isolated from the medicinal plant Aglaia, induces a rapid phosphorylation of Cdc25A and its subsequent degradation and, thereby, blocks cell cycle progression of tumor cells at the G1-S phase. Roc-A has previously been shown to inhibit tumor proliferation by blocking protein synthesis. In this study, we demonstrate that besides the translation inhibition Roc-A can induce a rapid degradation of Cdc25A by activation of the ATM/ATR-Chk1/Chk2 checkpoint pathway. However, Roc-A has no influence on cell cycle progression in proliferating normal T lymphocytes. Investigation of the molecular basis of tumor selectivity of Roc-A by a time-resolved microarray analysis of leukemic vs. proliferating normal T lymphocytes revealed that Roc-A activates different sets of genes in tumor cells compared with normal cells. In particular, Roc-A selectively stimulates a set of genes responsive to DNA replication stress in leukemic but not in normal T lymphocytes. These findings further support the development of Rocaglamide for antitumor therapy.",['(c) 2013 UICC.'],['NOTNLM'],"['ATM', 'ATR', 'Cdc25A', 'Chk1', 'Chk2', 'cell cycle']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have previously reported that safrole induced apoptosis in human oral cancer cells in vitro and inhibited the human oral tumor xenograft growth in vivo. Until now, there is no information addressing if safrole promotes immune responses in vivo. To evaluate whether safrole modulated immune function, BALB/c mice were intraperitoneally injected with murine myelomonocytic WEHI-3 leukemia cells to establish leukemia and then were treated with or without safrole at 4 and 16 mg/kg. Animals were sacrificed after 2 weeks post-treatment with safrole for examining the immune cell populations, phagocytosis of macrophages and the natural killer (NK) cells' cytotoxicity. Results indicated that safrole increased the body weight, and decreased the weights of spleen and liver in leukemic mice. Furthermore, safrole promoted the activities of macrophages phagocytosis and NK cells' cytotoxicity in leukemic mice when compared with untreated leukemic mice. After determining the cell marker population, we found that safrole promoted the levels of CD3 (T cells), CD19 (B cells) and Mac-3 (macrophages), but it did not affect CD11b (monocytes) in leukemic mice. In conclusion, safrole altered the immune modulation and inhibited the leukemia WEHI-3 cells in vivo.","['Copyright (c) 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc., A Wiley Company.']",['NOTNLM'],"['NK cell cytotoxicity', 'leukemic mice', 'macrophage phagocytosis', 'murine leukemia WEHI-3 cells', 'safrole']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this disease, an increase in sCD23 level is predictive of poor prognosis at diagnosis as well as during clinical outcome. Quantification of sCD23 is classically performed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), a method not routinely used in hematology laboratories. Our aim was to apply cytometric bead array (CBA) technology to measure sCD23 levels. We tested 420 serum samples, 360 from patients and 60 from healthy volunteers. We selected three pairs of monoclonal antibodies recognizing the CD23 molecule that were tested in various conditions of temperature, centrifugation, washing, or chemical supplementation. Satisfactory performances in terms of repeatability (CV: 5%) and reproducibility (CV: 6%) were obtained with the selected pair of antibodies, with a threshold of positivity at 6 ng/mL. CBA and ELISA techniques were correlated with a Spearman coefficient at 0.99. The reproducibility and reliability of the sCD23 CBA assay were confirmed, with a Spearman coefficient at 0.99 in a series of 23 CLL patients and 13 controls tested in two laboratories equipped with different cytometers and using different lots of CBA reagents. Data obtained with serum and plasma samples were correlated with a Spearman coefficient at 0.99.

However, to what degree primary malignant cells can be reprogrammed into a pluripotent state has not been vigorously assessed. We established an acute myeloid leukemia (AML) model by overexpressing the human mixed-lineage leukemia-AF9 (MLL-AF9) fusion gene in mouse hematopoietic cells that carry Yamanaka factors under the control of doxycycline (Dox). On addition of Dox to the culture, the transplantable leukemia cells were efficiently converted into iPS cells that could form teratomas and produce chimeras. Interestingly, most chimeric mice spontaneously developed the same type of AML. Moreover, both iPS reprogramming and leukemia reinitiation paths could descend from the same leukemia-initiating cell. RNA-seq analysis showed reversible global gene expression patterns between these interchangeable leukemia and iPS cells on activation or reactivation of MLL-AF9, suggesting a sufficient epigenetic force in driving the leukemogenic process. This study represents an important step for further defining the potential interplay between oncogenic molecules and reprogramming factors during MLL leukemogenesis. More importantly, our reprogramming approach may be expanded to characterize a range of hematopoietic malignancies in order to develop new strategies for clinical diagnosis and treatment.",,,,PMC4017259,,,,,,,,,,,,

We therefore conducted a multicenter, randomized phase III study to evaluate the antileukemic efficacy of adding fludarabine to sequential high-dose cytarabine+idarubicin (SHAI) re-induction chemotherapy in relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Patients (n=326, of which 281 were evaluable) were randomly assigned to SHAI (cytarabine, 1 g/m(2) bid, days 1-2 and 8-9 (3 g/m(2) for patients </= 60 years with refractory AML or >/= 2nd relapse); idarubicin 10 mg/m(2) daily, days 3-4 and 10-11) or F-SHAI (SHAI with fludarabine, 15 mg/m(2), 4 h before cytarabine). Although complete remission (CR) rates (35% SHAI and 44% F-SHAI) and overall survival did not differ between both regimens, fludarabine prolonged time to treatment failure from 2.04 to 3.38 months (median, P<0.05). Twenty-seven percent of patients proceeded to allogeneic stem cell transplantation, with a significantly higher number of patients in CR or incomplete remission in the F-SHAI group (22 vs 10%, P<0.01). In conclusion, fludarabine has a beneficial, although moderate, impact on the antileukemic efficacy of high-dose cytarabine-based salvage therapy for relapsed and refractory AML.",,,,,['German AML Cooperative Group (AMLCG)'],,,,,,,,,,,

We identified 141 genuine somatic mutations, most of which were not previously described. To test the frequency of the identified variants, a larger validation cohort of 189 MPN patients was additionally screened for these mutations using Ion Torrent AmpliSeq NGS. Excluding the genes already described in MPN, for 8 genes (SCRIB, MIR662, BARD1, TCF12, FAT4, DAP3, POLG and NRAS), we demonstrated a mutation frequency between 3 and 8%.

Little is known about how AML responds to hypomethylating agents after standard therapy, and the activity of these agents in a real-world setting is not well studied. We retrospectively examined data for 75 consecutive AML patients at Wake Forest from 2002 to 2011 treated with HAs either as first-line (n = 34), salvage (n = 28), or consolidation (n = 13) therapy. We collected data on age, gender, race, Charlson comorbidity index (CCI), cytogenetics, type of treatment, complete remission (CR), complete remission with incomplete count recovery (CRi), and survival. Statistical analysis was performed using Kaplan-Meier estimates and Cox proportional hazards models. Frontline response rate (CR + CRi) was 26.5 %, and median overall survival (OS) was 3.4 months (95 % CI 1.3-7.4), with 18 % alive at 1 year. In the salvage cohort, the response rate was significantly lower compared to frontline (3.6 versus 26.5 %, p = 0.017). Despite the reduced response, OS from time of HA treatment was longer than frontline at 8.2 months (CI 4.8-10.3). In the consolidation cohort, OS was 13.8 months (CI 8.0-21.6) with one patient in remission more than 30 months from diagnosis. These data suggest that prior cytotoxic therapy decreases marrow response rates to HAs but not survival. Furthermore, use of hypomethylating agents for consolidation resulted in a median overall survival over 1 year in a cohort of older patients. This suggests that hypomethylating agents have activity in all phases of AML treatment.",,,,PMC3879720,,,"['K23AG038361/AG/NIA NIH HHS/United States', 'K23 AG038361/AG/NIA NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA012197/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30CA012197/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'K08 CA169809/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', '1K08CA169809-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",['NIHMS534126'],,,,,,,,

Although previous reports showed that resistance training is feasible and effective, we hypothesized that a more intense exercise program would also be feasible, but more beneficial than low- to moderate-intensity training programs. We aimed to examine the effects of an exercise program combining high-intensity resistance exercises and moderate-intensity aerobic exercises in young patients undergoing treatment for ALL. A quasi-experimental study was conducted. The patients (n = 6; 5-16 years of age) underwent a 12-week intra-hospital training program involving high-intensity strength exercises and aerobic exercise at 70% of the peak oxygen consumption. At baseline and after 12 weeks, we assessed sub-maximal strength (10 repetition-maximum), quality of life and possible adverse effects. A significant improvement was observed in the sub maximal strength for bench press (71%), lat pull down (50%), leg press (73%) and leg extension (64%) as a result of the training (p < 0.01). The parents' evaluations of their children's quality of life revealed an improvement in fatigue and general quality of life, but the children's self-reported quality of life was not changed. No adverse effects occurred. A 12-week in-hospital training program including high-intensity resistance exercises promotes marked strength improvements in patients during the maintenance phase of the treatment for Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia without side-effects. Parents' evaluations of their children revealed an improvement in the quality of life.

METHODS: We have designed a 3+3 dose-escalating phase I trial with a fixed dose of MC (50 mg two times daily) plus IM (400 mg per day; 300 and 400 mg two times daily). Enrolled patients had IM- and sutininib-refractory advanced gastrointestinal stromal tumours (GIST) (n=17), chordoma (n=7) and mucosal melanoma (n=2). Dose-limiting toxicities were monitored for the first 6 weeks. Progression-free survival (PFS) and response assessment are based on RECIST 1.0 guidelines. Pharmacokinetics of IM were measured before and after exposure to MC. RESULTS: No dose-limiting toxicity was observed. Fourteen patients of the expanded cohort received 400 mg two times daily of IM with MC. Apart from a case of possibly related acute leukaemia occurring after 4 years of treatment, we did not see unexpected toxicity. No drug-drug pharmacokinetic interaction was observed. There was no objective response. We have observed long-lasting stable disease in chordoma patients (median PFS=10.2 months; range, 4.2-18+) and short-term stable disease in heavily GIST pretreated patients (median PFS=2.3 months; range, 2.1-6.6).

Adverse-risk karyotype AML is now treated with intensive chemotherapy followed by allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) to overcome relapse. We attempted to stratify patients with this disease using a combination of known factors. We evaluated clinical correlates in 211 adults with AML and adverse-risk karyotypes. We divided the patients into several subgroups based on the number of chromosomal aberrations (NCAs), normal karyotype (NK) mosaicism, and monosomal karyotype (MK) status. CR rates and survival outcomes were compared among the subgroups, and the relapse rate was calculated in the allo-HSCT subgroup. The cutoff of NCA >/= 5 showed the worst OS (P < .001) compared with NCA >/= 3 or NCA >/= 4 even after allo-HSCT. NK mosaicism significantly improved OS in both the NCA <5 (P = .024) and NCA >/= 5 (P = .030) subgroups, but after allo-HSCT, it showed a favorable effect only in the NCA <5 subgroup. MK showed worse OS (P = .041), but there was no significantly worse effect after allo-HSCT compared with non-MK. Finally, we stratified patients into 4 subgroups, NCA >/= 5 and NCA <5 with and without NK mosaicism. The most favorable OS and lower relapse rate after allo-HSCT were achieved by the NCA <5 with NK mosaicism subgroup, and the NCA >/= 5 without NK mosaicism subgroup showed the worst prognosis in both entire group and allo-HSCT subgroup analysis. This study reveals that the combination of NCA and NK mosaicism may predict survival outcomes accurately, and suggests that novel treatment strategies for highly adverse-risk group AML should be tailored in the future.","['Copyright (c) 2014 American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation.', 'Published by Elsevier Inc.

Phytochemical analysis of these active extracts led to the isolation of six cytotoxic constituents, viz., Ergostadien-3beta-ol (1), ludartin (2), 5-hydroxy-6,7,3',4'-tetramethoxyflavone (3) (from shoot) and trans-matricaria ester (4), diacetylenic spiroenol ether (5) and cis-matricaria ester (6) (from root) for the first time from this plant. The constituents were identified using spectral techniques in the light of literature. Sulphorhodamine B cytotoxicity screening of the isolated constituents was carried out against four human cancer cell lines including Lung (A-549), Leukaemia (THP-1), Prostate (PC-3) and Colon (HCT-116) cell lines. Ludartin (2) exhibited the highest cytotoxicity with IC50 values of 7.4muM, 3.1muM, 7.5muM and 6.9muM against Lung (A-549), Leukaemia (THP-1), Prostate (PC-3), Colon (HCT-116) cancer cell lines respectively. To test against in vitro skin cancer models [human dermal fibroblasts (CRL-1635)] all the isolates were further subjected to 3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-yl)-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT) cytotoxicity screening. Ludartin (2) being highly cytotoxic was again evaluated against mouse melanoma (B16F10) and human epidermoid carcinoma (A-431) cells by MTT assay displaying IC50 values of 6.6muM and 19.0muM respectively. Finally a simple and reliable HPLC method was developed (RP-HPLC-DAD) and validated for the simultaneous quantification of these cytotoxic constituents in A. amygdalina Decne. Excellent specificity and high linearity for all the standard calibration curves having regression coefficients of the respective linear equations in the range of 0.9962-0.9999 was observed. Relative recovery rates varied between 98.37+/-0.90 and 105.15+/-1.74 with relative standard deviation less than 4%.

In studies with L1210 ascitic tumor-bearing mice in which the dose of MIT was elevated from 2 to 8mg/kg, a saturation of antineoplastic efficacy was observed after plm60-s, and not after free MIT therapy. Total MIT concentrations in plasma, liver and ascitic fluids after plm60-s increased linearly with escalated doses. The released MIT concentrations in ascitic fluid increased continuously before reaching the peak at a dose of 6mg/kg and then decreased. In vitro release experiments using ascitic fluid as release medium revealed that at high concentrations of plm60-s the release of drug was inhibited. At a dose of 4mg/kg, the areas under the curve (AUC) of released MIT in ascitic fluid after plm60-s were higher than those after free MIT, which might be responsible for the enhanced efficacy of plm60-s.

Chromosome instability (CIN) has been detected in pNETs from patients with poor outcomes, but no specific genetic factors have been associated with CIN. Mutations in death domain-associated protein gene (DAXX) or ATR-X gene (ATRX) (which both encode proteins involved in chromatin remodeling) have been detected in 40% of pNETs, in association with activation of alternative lengthening of telomeres. We investigated whether loss of DAXX or ATRX, and consequent alternative lengthening of telomeres, are related to CIN in pNETs. We also assessed whether loss of DAXX or ATRX is associated with specific phenotypes of pNETs. METHODS: We collected well-differentiated primary pNET samples from 142 patients at the University Hospital Zurich and from 101 patients at the University Hospital Bern (both located in Switzerland). Clinical follow-up data were obtained for 149 patients from general practitioners and tumor registries. The tumors were reclassified into 3 groups according to the 2010 World Health Organization classification. Samples were analyzed by immunohistochemistry and telomeric fluorescence in situ hybridization. We correlated loss of DAXX, or ATRX, expression, and activation of alternative lengthening of telomeres with data from comparative genomic hybridization array studies, as well as with clinical and pathological features of the tumors and relapse and survival data. RESULTS: Loss of DAXX or ATRX protein and alternative lengthening of telomeres were associated with CIN in pNETs. Furthermore, loss of DAXX or ATRX correlated with tumor stage and metastasis, reduced time of relapse-free survival, and decreased time of tumor-associated survival. CONCLUSIONS: Loss of DAXX or ATRX is associated with CIN in pNETs and shorter survival times of patients. These results support the hypothesis that DAXX- and ATRX-negative tumors are a more aggressive subtype of pNET, and could lead to identification of strategies to target CIN in pancreatic tumors.",['Copyright (c) 2014 AGA Institute.

They are members of the genus Gammaretrovirus, are most closely related to gibbon ape leukemia virus (GaLV), feline leukemia virus (FeLV) and porcine endogenous retrovirus (PERV) and are likely the result of a relatively recent trans-species transmission from rodents or bats. The first KoRV to be isolated, KoRV-A, is widely distributed in the koala population in both integrated endogenous and infectious exogenous forms with evidence from museum specimens older than 150 years, indicating a relatively long engagement with the koala population. More recently, additional subtypes of KoRV that are not endogenized have been identified based on sequence differences and host cell receptor specificity (KoRV-B and KoRV-J). A specific association with fatal lymphoma and leukemia has been recently suggested for KoRV-B. In addition, it has been proposed that the high viral loads found in many animals may lead to immunomodulation resulting in a higher incidence of diseases such as chlamydiosis. Although the molecular basis of this immunomodulation is still unclear, purified KoRV particles and a peptide corresponding to a highly conserved domain in the envelope protein have been shown to modulate cytokine expression in vitro, similar to that induced by other gammaretroviruses. While much is still to be learned, KoRV induced lymphoma/leukemia and opportunistic disease arising as a consequence of immunomodulation are likely to play an important role in the stability of koala populations both in the wild and in captivity.",,,,PMC4016316,,,,,,,,,,,,

Among the HOXB cluster, HOXB1 was silent in a number of analyzed acute myeloid leukemia (AML) primary cells and cell lines, whereas it was expressed in normal terminally differentiated peripheral blood cells. METHODS: We evaluated the biological effects and the transcriptome changes determined by the retroviral transduction of HOXB1 in the human promyelocytic cell line HL60. RESULTS: Our results suggest that the enforced expression of HOXB1 reduces cell growth proliferation, inducing apoptosis and cell differentiation along the monocytic and granulocytic lineages. Accordingly, gene expression analysis showed the HOXB1-dependent down-regulation of some tumor promoting genes, paralleled by the up-regulation of apoptosis- and differentiation-related genes, thus supporting a tumor suppressor role for HOXB1 in AML. Finally, we indicated HOXB1 promoter hypermethylation as a mechanism responsible for HOXB1 silencing. CONCLUSIONS: We propose HOXB1 as an additional member of the HOX family with tumour suppressor properties suggesting a HOXB1/ATRA combination as a possible future therapeutic strategy in AML.",,,,PMC3874656,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although HHT has been successfully used as a therapeutic agent for leukemia, the drug resistance and toxicity are major concerns. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have been identified to modulate cellular sensitivity to anticancer drugs. We examined the synergistic action between miR-370 and HHT in vitro and in vivo. METHODS: The synergistic action between miR-370 and HHT was examined by flow cytometry. The effect of HHT on miR-370 expression was determined by quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR). The expression of miR-370 and Forkhead box M1 (FoxM1) in 23 patients with newly diagnosed chronic-phase chronic myeloid leukemia (CML-CP) and 10 patients with blast-crisis CML (CML-BP) as well as miR-370-targeted FoxM1 was determined by qRT-PCR and western blot analysis. RESULTS: Ectopic expression of miR-370 sensitized the CML K562 cell line to HHT by targeting FoxM1, the major regulator in cell proliferation and apoptosis. miR-370 significantly promoted HHT-mediated cell apoptosis and miR-370 and HHT cooperated in affecting FoxM1 expression. As well, miR-370 was moderately upregulated after HHT treatment in K562 cells. In addition, the expression of miR-370 was significantly reduced in CML patients as compared with healthy controls. Furthermore, the expression of miR-370 was lower in CML-BP than CML-CP patients. CONCLUSIONS: MiR-370 sensitized K562 cells to HHT by inducing apoptosis in part by downregulation of FoxM1 expression. These findings may provide further information for CML treatment with HHT.",,,,PMC4015315,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: We reviewed 20 patients receiving RT for MS lesions (in 43 RT courses) and analyzed the patients' clinicopathologic features and radiotherapeutic parameters, and their associations with complete responses (CR) to RT using Fisher's exact test and univariate logistic regression analysis. Generalized Estimating Equation was used to analyze all 43 irradiated lesions and account for the correlations in RT responses among lesions from the same patient. RESULTS: We found that the underlying hematological diseases of the evaluated patients were acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in 14 patients (70%), chronic myeloid leukemia in 4 patients (20%), myelodysplastic syndrome with AML transformation in one patient (5%), and de novo MS in one patient (5%). Most patients (55%) received RT for MS at the time of relapse following bone marrow transplantation (BMT). The most common cytogenetic abnormality was t(8;21)(q22;q22). The median RT dose of 20 Gy (range 6-35 Gy), administered in 1.5-3.5 Gy fractions, provided a 63% CR rate. RT dose, sex, cytogenetics, and bone marrow status at the time of RT had no significant effect on CR. Younger age (<50 y, P = 0.06), BMT prior to RT (P = 0.05), and underlying AML (P = 0.05) were marginally associated with higher CR to RT.

Human ESCs (hESCs), however, closely resemble mouse epiblast stem cells and correspond to the primed state. Primed stem cells are dependent on basic FGF for growth and show differentiation bias into different cell lineages. Recent studies have revealed that these two pluripotent states can be interconverted by modifying the culture conditions, although unequivocal evidence for obtaining truly naive hESCs has not been found.

In developing countries, copy medicines may be attractive due to low acquisition price, but their potential risks due to inadequately demonstrated bioequivalence have garnered only limited attention. As a result, policy-makers, physicians and patients may have incomplete information regarding their real-world safety and efficacy. Using chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) treatment as an example, we conducted a literature review of case reports and study publications to assess whether the available literature provides evidence on the real-world safety and efficacy of imatinib copies. While several publications described clinical outcomes with imatinib copy treatment, significant gaps in interpretability and quality exist. We conclude that clear demonstration of bioequivalence is critical for copy drugs, and in the presence of uncertain bioequivalence, greater pharmacovigilance and real-world data benchmarked against originator medications are needed to assess the impact of copy medicines and protect patients in developing countries.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Assignment of relevance of individual somatic mutations is difficult and poses the next challenge for interpretation of next generation sequencing data. Here we present an approach how exome sequencing in combination with SNP microarray data may identify targets of chromosomal aberrations in myeloid malignancies. The rationale of this approach is that hotspots of chromosomal aberrations might also harbor point mutations in the target genes of deletions, gains or uniparental disomies (UPDs). Chromosome 11 is a frequent target of lesions in myeloid malignancies. Therefore, we studied chromosome 11 in a total of 813 samples from 773 individual patients with different myeloid malignancies by SNP microarrays and complemented the data with exome sequencing in selected cases exhibiting chromosome 11 defects. We found gains, losses and UPDs of chromosome 11 in 52 of the 813 samples (6.4%). Chromosome 11q UPDs frequently associated with mutations of CBL. In one patient the 11qUPD amplified somatic mutations in both CBL and the DNA repair gene DDB1. A duplication within MLL exon 3 was detected in another patient with 11qUPD. We identified several common deleted regions (CDR) on chromosome 11. One of the CDRs associated with de novo acute myeloid leukemia (P=0.013). One patient with a deletion at the LMO2 locus harbored an additional point mutation on the other allele indicating that LMO2 might be a tumor suppressor frequently targeted by 11p deletions. Our chromosome-centered analysis indicates that chromosome 11 contains a number of tumor suppressor genes and that the role of this chromosome in myeloid malignancies is more complex than previously recognized.",,,,PMC3797696,,,['P 23257/Austrian Science Fund FWF/Austria'],,,,,,,,,

However, its use is associated with adverse cardiac effects, including cardiomyopathy and progressive heart failure. Given the multiple beneficial effects of the mitochondrial division inhibitor (mdivi-1) in a variety of pathological conditions including heart failure and ischaemia and reperfusion injury, we investigated the effects of mdivi-1 on doxorubicin-induced cardiac dysfunction in naive and stressed conditions using Langendorff perfused heart models and a model of oxidative stress was used to assess the effects of drug treatments on the mitochondrial depolarisation and hypercontracture of cardiac myocytes. Western blot analysis was used to measure the levels of p-Akt and p-Erk 1/2 and flow cytometry analysis was used to measure the levels p-Drp1 and p-p53 upon drug treatment. The HL60 leukaemia cell line was used to evaluate the effects of pharmacological inhibition of mitochondrial division on the cytotoxicity of doxorubicin in a cancer cell line. Doxorubicin caused a significant impairment of cardiac function and increased the infarct size to risk ratio in both naive conditions and during ischaemia/reperfusion injury. Interestingly, co-treatment of doxorubicin with mdivi-1 attenuated these detrimental effects of doxorubicin. Doxorubicin also caused a reduction in the time taken to depolarisation and hypercontracture of cardiac myocytes, which were reversed with mdivi-1. Finally, doxorubicin caused a significant elevation in the levels of signalling proteins p-Akt, p-Erk 1/2, p-Drp1 and p-p53. Co-incubation of mdivi-1 with doxorubicin did not reduce the cytotoxicity of doxorubicin against HL-60 cells. These data suggest that the inhibition of mitochondrial fission protects the heart against doxorubicin-induced cardiac injury and identify mitochondrial fission as a new therapeutic target in ameliorating doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity without affecting its anti-cancer properties.",,,,PMC3798380,,,,,,,,,,,,

In bovine leukemia virus (BLV) infection of cattle, although it is thought to be a minor route of infection, BLV can be transmitted to calves via milk. Here, we investigated the association between exosomes and BLV in bovine milk. BLV structural proteins, gp51 (Env) and p24 (Gag), were detected in bovine milk exosomes from BLV-infected cattle by Western blot analysis. In cells inoculated with these milk exosomes, BLV DNA was not detected during three serial passages by nested PCR. Purification of exosomes from persistently BLV-infected cells was achieved by immuno-magnetic separation using an antibody against exosomes coupled to magnetic beads. Consistently, BLV gp51 and p24 proteins were detected in purified exosomes. Moreover, reverse transcriptase activity was observed in purified exosomes, meaning that exosomes also contain viral enzyme. However, BLV DNA was not detected in serially passaged cells after inoculation of purified exosomes, indicating that exosomes carrying BLV proteins appeared to be not infectious. These results suggest that BLV proteins are released with milk exosomes and could be transferred into recipient cells of calves via milk exosomes as an alternative route not requiring virus infection. Moreover it is also possible that bovine milk exosomes play a role in clearance of BLV proteins from infected cells.",,,,PMC3798320,,,,,,,,,,,,

There have been few studies into the impact of different geographical scales on the outcome of spatial models for different spatial patterns. This study aims to investigate the impact of spatial scales and spatial smoothing on the outcomes of modelling spatial point-based data. Given a spatial point-based dataset (such as occurrence of a disease), we study the geographical variation of residual disease risk using regular grid cells. The individual disease risk is modelled using a logistic model with the inclusion of spatially unstructured and/or spatially structured random effects. Three spatial smoothness priors for the spatially structured component are employed in modelling, namely an intrinsic Gaussian Markov random field, a second-order random walk on a lattice, and a Gaussian field with Matern correlation function. We investigate how changes in grid cell size affect model outcomes under different spatial structures and different smoothness priors for the spatial component. A realistic example (the Humberside data) is analyzed and a simulation study is described. Bayesian computation is carried out using an integrated nested Laplace approximation. The results suggest that the performance and predictive capacity of the spatial models improve as the grid cell size decreases for certain spatial structures. It also appears that different spatial smoothness priors should be applied for different patterns of point data.",,,,PMC3795684,,,,,,,,,,,,

The specific molecular assay, that developed a lot in the last years, became an important tool in the management of these patients, providing the possibility of efficient changing in therapy. The purpose of our study was to identify the characteristics of our CML patients in terms of clinical and biological behavior. We analyzed 21 patients diagnosed between October 2007 and December 2010 and compared the data with a historical group of patients, also diagnosed in our department between March 2005 and September 2007.

Specifically, the effect of aging on inhibitor of apoptosis (IAP) gene family expression was investigated in glaucomatous eyes. METHODS: IOP was induced unilaterally in 82 Wistar rats using the translimbal photocoagulation laser model. IOP was measured using a TonoLab tonometer. RGC survival was evaluated in 3-, 6-, 13-, and 18-month-old animals. Changes in the RNA profiles of young (3-month-old) and old glaucomatous retinas were examined by PCR array for apoptosis; changes in selected genes were validated by real-time PCR; and changes in selected proteins were localized by immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: There were no significant IOP differences between the age groups. However, there was a natural significant loss of RGCs with aging and this was more prevalent in glaucomatous eyes. The number of RGCs in glaucomatous eyes decreased from 669+/-123 RGC/mm(2) at 3 months to 486+/-114 RGC/mm(2) at 6 months and 189+/-46.5 RGC/mm(2) at 18 months (n=4-8, p=0.048, analysis of variance). The PCR array revealed different changes in proapoptotic and prosurvival genes between young and old eyes. The two important prosurvival genes, IAP-1 and X-linked IAP (XIAP), acted in opposite directions in 3-month-old and 15-month-old rats, and were significantly decreased in aged glaucomatous retinas, while their expression increased significantly in young glaucomatous eyes. P53 levels did not vary between young glaucomatous and normal fellow eyes, but were reduced with age. B-cell leukemia/lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2) family members and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha expression were unaffected by age. Immunohistochemistry results suggested that the sources of changes in IAP-1 protein expression are RGCs and glial cells, and that most XIAP secretion comes from RGCs. CONCLUSIONS: Decreased IAP-1 and XIAP gene expression in aged eyes may predispose RGCs to increased vulnerability to glaucomatous damage. These findings suggest that aging impairs the endogenous neuroprotective mechanism of RGCs evoked by elevated IOP.",,,,PMC3783363,,,,,,,,,,,,

All cases meet World Health Organization 2008 criteria; 70.3 % of patients had B lymphoid/myeloid lineage MPAL. Induction chemotherapy protocols included 7 + 3 hyper-CVAD, high-density schedules, and pediatric-like regimens such as New York II and total XI. Complete remission was achieved in 23/27 patients (85.2 %). Only one patient died due to chemotherapy-induced aplasia during remission induction (5.2 %). In 68 % of cases, we were able to administer maintenance therapy as a regimen in lymphoblastic leukemia. At the time of analysis, 70.4 % of the patients in the entire cohort had died mainly as result of disease progression (73.6 %). Disease-free survival was 13 months (95 % CI, 9.6-16.3 months) and overall survival was 14.8 months (95 % CI 13.4-16.27). Survival rates are low and standardized therapy for the management of this type of leukemia is still lacking.

In hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), unique combinations of transcription factors largely control growth and maturation of different blood cell lineages through cooperative regulation of specific target genes. MicroRNAs provide an additional level of control beyond transcription factors. By acting as regulators of crucial lineage-specific genetic programs, microRNAs direct early multipotential progenitor cells to adopt a certain cell fate program. Thus, alteration of specific microRNA levels may affect proliferation, differentiation and genetic stability of HSCs, contributing to the onset of myeloproliferative disorders and leukemia. The major aim of this review is to highlight the critical role of microRNA-regulated pathways during the establishment and progression of hematological malignancies, with a particular attention to leukemia, lymphomas and myelodysplastic syndromes. This will give us the opportunity to discuss the potential use of microRNA-based therapeutic approaches in these diseases.

Although oral treatment with corticosteroids (CSs) is effective in treating gut GVHD, it can cause adverse reactions that affect the entire body. Topical administration of CSs can be effective in treating diseases in which lesions are limited locally, because adverse reactions can then be alleviated. In this study, we examine and discuss an enteric-coated beclomethasone dipropionate (BDP) capsule (BDP-EC) formulated at Okayama University Hospital. The BDP-EC did not dissolve in solution 1 (pH1.2), and began disintegrating in solution 2 (pH6.8) after 5min, with a mean dissolution rate at 15min of 85%. We then used the capsule to treat a patient who developed gut GVHD after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Clinically, the frequency of diarrhea decreased after BDP-EC administration. In addition, we were able to decrease the prednisolone equivalent dose. Symptoms associated with adverse reactions to BDP were not observed during the hospitalization period. These findings suggest that the administration of BDP-EC in the early stages of gut GVHD may allow a reduction in the initial doses of systemic CSs.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Loss- and gain-of-function studies have revealed the role of miR-17 approximately 92 in heart, lung, and B-cell development and in Myc-induced B-cell lymphomas, respectively. Recent studies indicate that overexpression of this locus leads to lymphoproliferation, but no experimental proof that dysregulation of this cluster causes B-cell lymphomas or leukemias is available. To determine whether miR-17 approximately 92- overexpression induces lymphomagenesis/leukemogenesis, we generated a B-cell-specific transgenic mouse model with targeted overexpression of this cluster in B cells. The miR-17 approximately 92 overexpression was driven by the Emicro-enhancer and Ig heavy-chain promoter, and a 3' GFP tag was added to the transgene to track the miR expression. Expression analysis using Northern Blot and quantitative RT-PCR confirmed 2.5- to 25-fold overexpression of all six miRs in the transgenic mice spleens as compared with spleens from wild-type mice. Emicro-miR-17 approximately 92 mice developed B-cell malignancy by the age of 12-18 mo with a penetrance of approximately 80% (49% splenic B-cell lymphoproliferative disease, 28% lymphoma).

Specific interactions between scaffolding proteins are known to have important roles for the formation and maintenance of nuclear structures. General physical mechanisms such as molecular crowding, phase separation or colloidal behavior have also been suggested, but their physiological significance remains uncertain. For macromolecular crowding, a role in the maintenance of nucleoli and promyelocytic leukemia (PML) nuclear bodies has been shown. Here, we tested whether a modulation of the compaction state of chromatin, which directly influences the local crowding state, has an impact on the formation and maintenance of densely packed heterochromatin. By osmotic perturbations, we could modify the packing state of chromatin in a controlled manner and show that chromatin compaction, which is associated with increased crowding conditions, is not, per se, sufficient to initiate the formation of new bona fide heterochromatin structures nor is it necessary to maintain already established heterochromatin domains. In consequence, if an increase in crowding induced by chromatin compaction maybe an early step in heterochromatin formation, specific protein-protein interactions are nevertheless required to make heterochromatin long lasting and independent of the crowding state.",['Copyright (c) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

Although a prodeath role has been reported in certain contexts, treatment-induced autophagy often exerts a prosurvival function by preventing apoptosis and delaying necrosis. Interestingly, a more specific role of autophagy has been demonstrated in certain subtypes of leukemia. The fusion oncoproteins PML-RARA and BCR-ABL, the main oncogenic drivers of acute promyelocytic leukemia and chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), respectively, have recently been identified as autophagy substrates and their degradation by autophagy shown to contribute to treatment. However, this does not seem to be a general feature of leukemic fusion oncoproteins, as we recently found that AML1-ETO, the most frequently occurring acute myeloid leukemia (AML) fusion protein, is not an autophagy substrate. Rather we demonstrate a clear prosurvival role of autophagy in this AML subtype and that addition of autophagy inhibitors in the treatment regimen might be beneficial.",,['NOTNLM'],"['AML', 'AML1-ETO', 'BCR-ABL', 'PML-RARA', 'autophagy', 'chloroquine', 'leukemia', 'valproic acid', 'vorinostat']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

The ABC family of membrane transporters is proposed, albeit with controversy, to be involved in this process. The present study aims to investigate the mRNA expression profile of several genes of this family, including ABCA2, ABCA3, ABCB1/MDR1, MRP1/ABCC1, MRP3/ABCC3, ABCG2/BCRP, and the intracellular transporter MVP/LRP, in childhood ALL, and to evaluate their association with response to therapy. Some genes in the present research are being studied for the first time in Iran. Using quantitative real-time PCR, we evaluated 27 children with ALL at diagnosis and 15 children with normal bone marrow. The status of response to therapy was assessed one year after the onset of therapy through investigating the IgH/TCRgamma gene rearrangements. Our findings indicate a considerable and direct relationship between mRNA expression levels of ABCA2, ABCA3, MDR1, and MRP1 genes and positive minimal residual disease (MRD) measured after one year of treatment. Statistical analysis revealed that expression of these genes higher than the cutoff point will raise the risk of MRD by 15-, 6.25-, 12-, and 9-fold, respectively. No relationship was found between of MVP/LRP, MRP3 and ABCG2 genes expression and ALL prognoses. Considering the direct and significant relationship between the increased expression of ABCA2, ABCA3, MDR1, and MRP1 genes and positive risk of MRD in children with ALL, evaluating the expression profile of these genes on diagnosis may identify high risk individuals and help plan a more efficient treatment strategy.",,['NOTNLM'],"['ABC transporter', 'acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'minimal residual disease', 'multidrug resistance']",PMC3938522,,,,,,,,,,,,

Better outcome was observed for patients transplanted before the age of 10 years, before clonal evolution (ie, myelodysplastic syndrome or acute myeloid leukemia), from a matched family donor, after a conditioning regimen without irradiation, the latter including fludarabine. Chronic graft-versus-host disease and secondary malignancy were deleterious when considered as time-dependent covariates. Age more than 10 years at time of HSCT, clonal evolution as an indication for transplantation, peripheral blood as source of stem cells, and chronic graft-versus-host disease were found to be independently associated with the risk for secondary malignancy.

In this study, we identified a novel activating variant of thrombopoietin receptor, termed Mpl-D, in human megakaryoblastic leukemia Dami cells and demonstrated that the binding affinity of the Mpl-D receptor for thrombopoietin is enhanced. Cell cycle analysis revealed that in the presence of thrombopoietin, most Mpl-D expressing NIH3T3 (NIH3T3/Mpl-D) cells were prevalent in G1 phase while the S and G2/M populations were less frequently observed. Unexpectedly, thrombopoietin induced strong and prolonged ERK1/2 signaling in NIH3T3/Mpl-D cells compared with its receptor wild-type expressing NIH3T3 (NIH3T3/Mpl-F) cells. Further analysis of the mRNA levels of cyclin D1/D2 in NIH3T3/Mpl-D cells demonstrated markedly down-regulated expression compared to NIH3T3/Mpl-F cells in the presence of thrombopoietin. Thus, the prolonged activation of ERK1/2 by Mpl-D might lead to G1 cell cycle arrest through a profound reduction of cyclin D1/D2 in order to support cell survival without proliferation. We also provided tertiary structural basis for the Mpl-D and thrombopoietin interaction, which might provide insights into how Mpl-D effectively increases binding to thrombopoietin and significantly contributes to its specific signaling pathway. These results suggest a new paradigm for the regulation of cytokine receptor expression and function through the alternative splicing variant of Mpl in Dami cells, which may play a role in the pathogenesis of megakaryoblastic leukemia.",['Copyright (c) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

The constantly increasing spectrum of molecular mutations is a tremendous challenge for hematological laboratories. The introduction of high-throughput sequencing technology, which allows the massive parallel analysis of hundreds of thousands of alleles in the shortest time, provides new options for molecular mutation analyses and for follow-up diagnostics in myeloid neoplasms. In contrast to whole-genome or exome analyses, amplicon deep-sequencing focuses on distinct genomic loci and their mutation patterns and enables a comprehensive biomarker analysis in a multitude of patients per analysis. This review summarizes thus far established common molecular diagnostic strategies and intends to outline the perspective of distinct novel amplicon deep-sequencing panels for patients with AML and MDS.

In agreement, reduced expression of TOB1 was also observed in resistant patients with CML compared to responsive patients.

We make use of the layer-by-layer (LbL) technique to coat protein-loaded calcium carbonate (CaCO3) particles with two or three poly dextran/poly-L-arginine-based bilayers. To achieve high loading efficiency, the CaCO3 template was generated by coprecipitation with the enzyme. After assembly of the polymer shell, the CaCO3 core material was dissolved under mild conditions by dialysis against 20 mM EDTA. Biochemical stability of the encapsulated L-asparaginase was analyzed by treating the capsules with the proteases trypsin and thrombin, which are known to degrade and inactivate the enzyme during leukemia treatment, allowing us to test for resistance against proteolysis by physiologically relevant proteases through measurement of residual l-asparaginase activities. In addition, the thermal stability, the stability at the physiological temperature, and the long-term storage stability of the encapsulated enzyme were investigated. We show that encapsulation of l-asparaginase remarkably improves both proteolytic resistance and thermal inactivation at 37 degrees C, which could considerably prolong the enzyme's in vivo half-life during application in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL).

METHODS: We reviewed recent publications on PubMed and abstracts from major congresses relevant to the topic. RESULTS: Therapeutic options for front-line treatment have increased with the approval of two second-generation BCR-ABL inhibitors, dasatinib and nilotinib. Both agents are also treatment options for patients with resistance or intolerance to front-line imatinib. More recently, bosutinib, ponatinib, and omacetaxine have also been approved for patients with resistance or intolerance to prior therapy. DISCUSSION: Expanded treatment options coupled with rapidly changing treatment guidelines have led to numerous questions regarding the selection and monitoring of therapy. Common concerns include how to best select therapy based upon patient-specific comorbidities, monitoring and interpretation of treatment outcomes, and optimization of dosing when side effects occur.",,['NOTNLM'],"['BCR-ABL inhibitors', 'CML', 'Dasatinib', 'Imatinib', 'Nilotinib']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Transplants were performed in France with reduced intensity or myeloablative conditioning regimens. Costs were estimated from donor search to 1 year after transplantation. A Markov decision analysis model was used to calculate quality-adjusted life-years and cost-effectiveness ratio within 4 years. The overall survival at 2 years after single and double cord blood transplants was 42% versus 62%, respectively (P=0.03), while the leukemia-free-survival was 33% versus 53%, respectively (P=0.03). The relapse rate was 21% after double transplants and 42% after a single transplant (P=0.006). No difference was observed for non-relapse mortality or chronic graft-versus-host-disease. The estimated costs up to 1 year after reduced intensity conditioning for single and double cord blood transplantation were euro 165,253 and euro191,827, respectively. The corresponding costs after myeloablative conditioning were euro 192,566 and euro 213,050, respectively. Compared to single transplants, double cord blood transplantation was associated with supplementary costs of euro 21,302 and euro 32,420 up to 4 years, but with increases in quality-adjusted life-years of 0.616 and 0.484, respectively, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios of euro 34,581 and euro66,983 in the myeloablative and reduced intensity conditioning settings, respectively.

In this study, we observed that prednisolone exposure of prednisolone-sensitive patients' leukemic cells decreased anti-apoptotic MCL1 protein levels by 2.9-fold, while MCL1 protein expression in prednisolone-resistant leukemic patients' cells was unaffected (P<0.01). Locked nucleic acid oligonucleotides directed against MCL1 reduced MCL1 protein levels by 82+/-16% (P<0.05) in leukemic cells, decreased proliferation by 9-fold and sensitized to prednisolone up to 80.8-fold, compared to a non-silencing-control locked nucleic acid (P<0.05). Remarkably, we discovered that MCL1-silencing up-regulated the glucose consumption of leukemic cells by 2.5-fold (P<0.05), suggesting a potential rescue mechanism mediated by glycolysis. Targeting glycolysis by 2-deoxyglucose synergistically inhibited leukemic survival by 23.2-fold in MCL1-silenced cells (P<0.05). Moreover, 2-deoxyglucose and MCL1 locked nucleic acid concomitantly sensitized leukemic cells to prednisolone compared to MCL1 locked nucleic acid or 2-deoxyglucose alone (P<0.05).

Secondary hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis typically occurs in association with severe infections or malignancies. Patients with acute myeloid leukemia may be prone to develop hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis because of an impaired immune response and a high susceptibility to severe infections. In a series of 343 patients treated by intensive chemotherapy over a 5-year period in our center, we identified 32 patients (9.3%) with fever, very high ferritin levels, and marrow hemophagocytosis (i.e. patients with hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis). Compared to patients without hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, these 32 patients had hepatomegaly, pulmonary or neurological symptoms, liver abnormalities, lower platelet count and higher levels of C-reactive protein as well as prolonged pancytopenia. A microbial etiology for the hemophagocytosis was documented in 24 patients: 14 bacterial infections, 9 Herpesviridae infections and 11 fungal infections. The treatment of hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis consisted of corticosteroids and/or intravenous immunoglobulins along with adapted antimicrobial therapy. Patients with hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis had a median overall survival of 14.9 months, which was significantly shorter than that of patients without hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (22.1 months) (P=0.0016). Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis was significantly associated with a higher rate of induction failure, mainly due to deaths in aplasia. Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis can be diagnosed in up to 10% of patients with acute myeloid leukemia undergoing intensive chemotherapy and is associated with early mortality. Fever, very high ferritin levels and marrow hemophagocytosis represent the cornerstone of the diagnosis. Further biological studies are needed to better characterize and recognize this syndrome in patients with acute myeloid leukemia.",,,,PMC3943310,,,,,,,,,,,,

A comprehensive analysis using single-gene assays requires large amounts of DNA, is cumbersome and timely consolidation of results for clinical reporting is challenging. High throughput, next-generation sequencing platforms widely used in research have not been tested vigorously for clinical application. Here we describe the clinical application of MiSeq, a next-generation sequencing platform to screen mutational hotspots in 54 cancer-related genes including genes relevant in acute myeloid leukemia (NRAS, KRAS, FLT3, NPM1, DNMT3A, IDH1/2, JAK2, KIT and EZH2). We sequenced 63 samples from patients with acute myeloid leukemia/myelodysplastic syndrome using MiSeq and compared the results with those obtained using another next-generation sequencing platform, Ion-Torrent Personal Genome Machine and other conventional testing platforms. MiSeq detected a total of 100 single nucleotide variants and 23 NPM1 insertions that were confirmed by Ion Torrent or conventional platforms, indicating complete concordance. FLT3-internal tandem duplications (n=10) were not detected; however, re-analysis of the MiSeq output by Pindel, an indel detection algorithm, did detect them. Dilution studies of cancer cell-line DNA showed that the quantitative accuracy of mutation detection was up to an allelic frequency of 1.5% with a high level of inter- and intra-run assay reproducibility, suggesting potential utility for monitoring response to therapy, clonal heterogeneity and evolution. Examples demonstrating the advantages of MiSeq over conventional platforms for disease monitoring are provided. Easy work-flow, high throughput multiplexing capability, 4-day turnaround time and simultaneous assessment of routinely tested and emerging markers make MiSeq highly applicable for clinical molecular testing in acute myeloid leukemia.",,,,PMC3943309,,,['P30 CA016672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,

We tested the hypothesis that traffic-related air pollution is associated with paediatric leukaemia because of chronic exposure to several potential carcinogens. METHODS: The Italian SETIL study (Study on the aetiology of lymphohematopoietic malignancies in children) was conducted in 14 Italian regions. All incident cases of leukaemia in children aged </=10 years from these regions (period 1998-2001) were eligible for enrolment. Two controls per case, matched on birth date, gender and region of residence were randomly selected from the local population registries. Exposure assessment at birth residence included traffic indicators (distance to main roads and length of main roads within 100 m) and estimates of pollutants concentrations (particulate matter -PM2.5 and PM10- and gases -NO2 and O3-) from national dispersion model and land use regression models. The association between the exposure variables and leukaemia was assessed by logistic regression analyses. RESULTS: Participation rates were 91.4% among cases and 69.2% in controls; 620 cases (544 acute lymphocytic and 76 acute non-lymphocytic leukaemia) and 957 controls were included. Overall, when considering the residence at birth, 35.6% of cases and 42.4% of controls lived along busy roads, and the mean annual PM10 levels were 33.3 (SD=6.3) and 33.4 microg/m(3) (SD=6.5), respectively. No association was found, and all ORs, independent of the method of assessment and the exposure windows, were close to the null value. CONCLUSIONS: Using various exposure assessment strategies, air pollution appears not to affect the incidence of childhood leukaemia.",,['NOTNLM'],"['Children', 'Dispersion Model', 'Land use Regression Model', 'Traffic Indicators']",,['SETIL Study Group'],,,,,,,,,,"['Magnani C', 'Mattioli S', 'Miligi L', 'Ranucci A', 'Rondelli R', 'Salvan A', 'Masera G', 'Rizzari C', 'Bisanti L', 'Zambon P', 'Greco A', 'Cannizzaro S', 'Gafa L', 'Luzzatto LL', 'Benvenuti A', 'Michelozzi P', 'Kirchmayer U', 'Cocco P', 'Galassi C', 'Celentano E', 'Guarino E', 'Assennato G', 'de Nichilo G', 'Merlo DF', 'Bocchini V', 'Mosciatti P', 'Minelli L', 'Chiavarini M', 'Cuttini M', 'Casotto V', 'Torregrossa MV', 'Valenti RM', 'Forastiere F', 'Haupt R', 'Lagorio S', 'Risica S', 'Polichetti A', 'Bochicchio F', 'Nuccetelli C', 'Biddau P', 'Arico M', 'De Salvo GL', 'Locatelli F', 'Pession A', 'Varotto S', 'Poggi V', 'Massaglia P', 'Monetti D', 'Targhetta R', 'Bernini G', 'Pannelli F', 'Sampietro G', 'Schiliro G', 'Pulsoni A']","['Magnani, Corrado', 'Mattioli, Stefano', 'Miligi, Lucia', 'Ranucci, Alessandra', 'Rondelli, Roberto', 'Salvan, Alberto', 'Masera, Giuseppe', 'Rizzari, Carmelo', 'Bisanti, Luigi', 'Zambon, Paola', 'Greco, Alessandra', 'Cannizzaro, Santina', 'Gafa, Lorenzo', 'Luzzatto, Lia Lidia', 'Benvenuti, Alessandra', 'Michelozzi, Paola', 'Kirchmayer, Ursula', 'Cocco, Pierluigi', 'Galassi, Claudia', 'Celentano, Egidio', 'Guarino, Erni', 'Assennato, Giorgio', 'de Nichilo, Gigliola', 'Merlo, Domenico Franco', 'Bocchini, Vittorio', 'Mosciatti, Paola', 'Minelli, Liliana', 'Chiavarini, Manuela', 'Cuttini, Marina', 'Casotto, Veronica', 'Torregrossa, Maria Valeria', 'Valenti, Rosaria Maria', 'Forastiere, Francesco', 'Haupt, Riccardo', 'Lagorio, Susanna', 'Risica, Serena', 'Polichetti, Alessandro', 'Bochicchio, Francesco', 'Nuccetelli, Cristina', 'Biddau, Pierfranco', 'Arico, Maurizio', 'De Salvo, Gian Luca', 'Locatelli, Franco', 'Pession, Andrea', 'Varotto, Stefania', 'Poggi, Vincenzo', 'Massaglia, Pia', 'Monetti, Daniele', 'Targhetta, Roberto', 'Bernini, Gabriella', 'Pannelli, Franco', 'Sampietro, Giuseppe', 'Schiliro, Gino', 'Pulsoni, Alessandro']"

T(reg) cells in the peripheral blood of 80 AML patients and 35 age-matched healthy controls were counted by flow cytometry. Correlations between the frequency of circulating T(reg) cells and disease status, treatment outcome, or prognosis were evaluated. The percentages of T(reg) cells in patients at diagnosis and during refractory/relapse were significantly higher than that in healthy controls. There was no significant difference in the percentages of T(reg) cells between patients in remission and healthy controls. After six cycles of chemotherapy, the percentage of T(reg) cells in patients who achieved complete remission was significantly lower than that in patients at diagnosis, but there was no difference in T(reg) frequency between refractory/relapse patients and patients at diagnosis. T(reg) cells in the peripheral blood of AML patients may play a suppressive role in host antitumor immune response. The frequency of T(reg) cells in peripheral blood may thus be used as a biomarker for predicting sensitivity to chemotherapy and prognosis of AML patients. Additionally, T(reg) number in peripheral blood could be used to monitor disease status and evaluate disease progression.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is thought to be derived from plasmacytoid dendritic cell precursors, which frequently present as cutaneous lesions. We have made a detailed analysis of an infant with BPDCN, who manifested with hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis. The peripheral blood leukocytes revealed the t(2;17;8)(p23;q23;p23) translocation and a CLTC-ALK fusion gene, which have never been reported in BPDCN or in any myeloid malignancies thus far. Neonatal blood spots on the patient's Guthrie card were analyzed for the presence of the CLTC-ALK fusion gene, identifying the in utero origin of the leukemic cell. Although the leukemic cells were positive for CD4, CD56, CD123, and CD303, indicating a plasmacytoid dendritic cell phenotype, detailed analysis of the lineage distribution of CLTC-ALK revealed that part of monocytes, neutrophils, and T cells possessed the fusion gene and were involved in the leukemic clone. These results indicated that leukemic cells with CLTC-ALK originated in a multipotent hematopoietic progenitor in utero. This is the first report of the CLTC-ALK fusion gene being associated with a myeloid malignancy, which may give us an important clue to the origin of this rare neoplasm.","['Copyright (c) 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Leucine is tightly linked to the mTOR pathway and can activate it, thereby stimulating cellular proliferation. LAT3 is a major transporter for leucine, and suppression of its expression can reduce cell proliferation. Here, we show that suppression of LAT3 expression can reduce proliferation of the acute leukemia cell line, K562. We investigated the mRNA and protein expression of LAT3 in several leukemia cell lines and normal peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMNCs) using RT-PCR and Western blotting. We also evaluated cell viability using a methyl thiazolyl tetrazolium (MTT) assay after blocking LAT3 expression with either shRNA targeted to LAT3 or a small molecular inhibitor BCH (2-aminobicyclo-(2,2,1)-heptane-2-carboxylic acid). LAT3 mRNA and protein expression was detected in leukemia cell lines, but not in normal PBMNCs. Using K562 cells, it was found that cellular proliferation and mTOR pathway activity were significantly reduced when LAT3 was blocked with either shRNA or BCH. Our results suggest that leukemia cell proliferation can be significantly suppressed by blocking LAT3. This finding may lead to a new strategy to develop clinical therapy for the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The association between the MDR1 G2677T polymorphism and leukemia risk was conducted by odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI).

METHODS: A patient with childhood CD who underwent allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (BMT) for chronic myelogenous leukemia was followed for 5 years after resumption of gluten containing diet. Immunological memory to gliadin epitopes was assessed in the index patient and in 5 newly diagnosed CD patients by standard serology testing and by CFSE-based proliferation assays of peripheral blood CD4+ cells and of intestinal LPL towards gliadin-TTG antigens. Intestinal lymphocytes' origin was determined by combined immuno-histochemistry and fluorescent in-situ hybridiazation (FISH). RESULTS: Over 5 years of follow-up after receiving BMT from a HLA-matched woman and cessation of gluten-free diet, the patient has remained well, with negative periodic antibodies assays and unremarkable serial duodenal biopsies. In vitro proliferation assays showed lack of a memory response of the patient's peripheral blood and lamina propria CD4+ T-cells towards TTG, gliadin or TTG-treated gliadin, whereas memory responses were evident in the newly diagnosed CD patients. Immuno-FISH of post-BMT duodenal mucosa showed that the chromosomal phenotype of all the epithelial cells was XY. In contrast, CD45+ lymphocytic lineage cells were all donor-derived XX cells, presumably originating in the transplanted bone marrow and re-populating the intestinal wall. CONCLUSIONS: CD resolution following allogeneic BMT is associated with absent gliadin-specific memory response, and with a dichotomous lymphocyte-epithelial chimeric intestine. These observations suggest that the pathogenesis of CD is critically dependent upon the immune system rather than the epithelial compartment.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Previous studies indicated that YB-1 binds to mispaired DNA and interacts with several mismatch repair (MMR)-related factors. However, its role in the MMR system remains undefined. Here, we found that YB-1 represses mutS homolog 6 (MSH6)-containing MMR complex formation and reduces MutSalpha mismatch binding activity by disrupting interactions among MMR-related factors. In an effort to elucidate how YB-1 exerts this inhibitory effect, we have identified two functional proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA)-interacting protein (PIP)-boxes that mediate YB-1/PCNA interaction and locate within the C-terminal region of YB-1. This interaction is critical for the regulatory role of YB-1 in repressing MutSalpha mismatch binding activity, disrupting MutSalpha/PCNA/G/T heteroduplex ternary complex formation and inhibiting in vitro MMR activity. The differential regulation of 3' and 5' nick-directed MMR activity by YB-1 was also observed. Moreover, YB-1 overexpression is associated with the alteration of microsatellite pattern and the enhancement of N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine (MNNG)-induced and spontaneous mutations. Furthermore, upregulation of other PIP-box-containing proteins, such as myeloid cell leukemia-1 (Mcl-1) and inhibitor of growth protein 1b (ING1b), has no impact on MMR complex formation and mutation accumulation, thus revealing the significant effect of YB-1 on regulating the MMR system. In conclusion, our study suggests that YB-1 functions as a PCNA-interacting factor to exert its regulatory role on the MMR process and involves in the induction of genome instability, which may partially account for the oncogenic potential of YB-1.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the present study, we assessed IgM heavy chain expression and repertoire in human myeloid cells.

We also found evidence of somatic hypermutation of the variable (V) gene segments in AML-derived IgM gene rearrangements but not in IgM from monocytes or neutrophils from patients with non-hematopoietic neoplasms and healthy individuals. Furthermore, IgM VHmuDJHmu gene rearrangements in AML cell lines, primary myeloblasts, and monocytes and neutrophils from patients with non-hematopoietic neoplasms showed a restricted V usage and repertoire, whereas the VHmuDJHmu gene rearrangements in monocytes and neutrophils from healthy individuals displayed more diversity. Anti-human IgM inhibited cell proliferation, but did not induce apoptosis in AML cell lines.

Potential mechanisms mediating the effect were also explored in the experiment. Cultured MEC1 cells were incubated with various concentrations of realgar for 24, 48 and 72 h. A WST8 assay was employed to evaluate the effect on cell viability. Inhibitory effects on cell proliferation were determined using a 5bromodeoxyuridine cell proliferation ELISA. The apoptotic effect on MEC1 cells was evaluated by annexin Vfluorescein isothiocyanate/propidium iodide dual staining, followed by flow cytometry. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction was performed to determine the mRNA expression levels of BCL2associated X protein (BAX), BCL2like 1 (Bcl-xL), vmyc myelocytomatosis viral oncogene homolog (avian; cMyc) and cyclindependent kinase inhibitor 1A (p21). It was found that viability and proliferation were significantly reduced while apoptotic rates increased in MEC1 cells following exposure to realgar. Furthermore, mRNA expression of BAX and cMyc was upregulated and downregulated, respectively, in realgartreated MEC1 cells. In conclusion, the results showed that realgar inhibits viability and prolife-ration and induces apoptosis of MEC1 cells in a dose and timedependent manner. The effect may depend on the mitochondrial apoptosis pathway. The results of the present study may be beneficial in the identification of a new target therapy for CLL.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In previous studies, valproic acid (VPA), an inhibitor of histone deacetylases, combined with fludarabine to synergistically increase apoptotic cell death in CLL cells. In the present study, we found that the combination of fludarabine and VPA decreases the level of the anti-apoptotic proteins Mcl-1 and XIAP in primary CLL cells. Treatment with fludarabine alone, or in combination with VPA, led to the loss of lysosome integrity, and chemical inhibition of the lysosomal protease cathepsin B, using CA074-Me, was sufficient to reduce apoptosis. VPA treatment increased cathepsin B levels and activities in primary CLL cells, thereby priming CLL cells for lysosome-mediated cell death. Six previously treated patients with relapsed CLL were treated with VPA, followed by VPA/fludarabine combination. The combined therapy resulted in reduced lymphocyte count in five out of six and reduced lymph node sizes in four out of six patients. In vivo VPA treatment increased histone-3 acetylation and cathepsin B expression levels. Thus, the synergistic apoptotic response with VPA and fludarabine in CLL is mediated by cathepsin B activation leading to a decrease in the anti-apoptotic proteins.",,,,PMC3816211,,,,,,,,,,,,

Seventy-two mice were allocated into a control group (CON), sham operation group (SHA), physiological saline (NS) treatment group (PD), and LIF treatment group (LIF), n=18 for each group. The 6-OHDA was injected into the mice`s left mid-striatum to build a 6-OHDA model of PD. The LIF or NS was slowly released into the CSF through the ALZET osmotic pump catheters duct, in the LIF or NS treated groups. The whole treatment lasted 3 weeks, and the motor functions of the mice were assessed on the seventh, fourteenth, and twenty-first day during the treatment. The nestin-positive cells in the mice were counted by immunofluorescence assays, and the level of gp130 was detected with western blot analysis. RESULTS: After CSF infusion in the LIF-treated group, we observed an increased number of nestin-positive cells in the mice`s brains. The expression of a major component of the LIF receptor complex, gp130, was also increased. In the fourteenth and twenty-first day time periods; LIF treatment continuously improved the motor functions of the mouse model of PD.

The mechanism by which Bestatin enhances all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA)-induced cell differentiation of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) cells is generally attributed to inhibition of cell surface CD13/aminopeptidase N activity. Bestatin also exerts its biological activities besides its ability to inhibit aminopeptidase N enzymatic activity. This article provides data to support an alternative mechanism regarding an important role of inhibition of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signal pathway in Bestatin's anti-leukemia effect. Bestatin enhanced ATRA-induced differentiation and inhibited ATRA-driven phosphorylation of p38 MAPK in ATRA-sensitive APL NB4 cells. In contrast, Bestatin could not reverse the differentiation block in ATRA-resistant APL MR2 cells, in which ATRA was unable to induce phosphorylation of p38 MAPK. Moreover, CD13 ligation with anti-CD13 antibody WM-15 resulted in phosphorylation of p38 MAPK, reduced the inhibition of Bestatin on the phosphorylation of p38 MAPK, and completely abolished the enhancement of Bestatin on ATRA-inducing differentiation in NB4 cells. This study shows that inhibition of p38 MAPK phosphorylation is critical for Bestatin to enhance ATRA-induced cell differentiation in ATRA-sensitive APL NB4 cells. Results suggested that pharmacological inhibition of the p38 MAPK pathway might enhance ATRA-dependent differentiation.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Based on this, a signal-on protocol was successively achieved for microRNAs detection due to the dependence of photocurrent response on the concentration of electron donor of AA. The results demonstrated that the photocurrent response enhanced with increasing the hybridized concentration of microRNA. Under the amplification of the immunogold labeled streptavidin (SA-AuNPs), a low detection limit of 1.67 fM was obtained.

The Framingham general cardiovascular risk score (FGCRS) in males at five years after SCT projected a doubling (median 10.4% vs. 5.4%) in the 10-year risk of cardiovascular events. Females received HRT after SCT, and none had increased FGCRS. Chronic GVHD and C-reactive protein were not associated with CVRF at any time. All CVRFs stabilized between five and ten years after SCT.

Although minor histocompatibility antigens (MiHA) represent promising targets, broad expression of these antigens has been associated with poor responses and T cell dysfunction that may not be prevented by targeting MiHA with limited expression. In this study, we hypothesized that antitumor activity of MiHA-specific CD8 T cells after allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (BMT) is determined by the distribution of antigen relative to the site of tumor growth. To test this hypothesis, we utilized the clinically relevant male-specific antigen HY and studied the fate of adoptively transferred, HY-CD8(+) T cells (HY-CD8) against a HY-expressing epithelial tumor (MB49) and pre-B cell leukemia (HY-E2APBX ALL) in BMT recipients. Transplants were designed to produce broad HY expression in nonhematopoietic tissues (female --> male BMT, [F --> M]), restricted HY expression in hematopoietic tissues (male --> female BMT, [M --> F]) tissues, and no HY tissue expression (female --> female BMT, [F --> F]). Broad HY expression induced poor responses to MB49 despite sublethal graft-versus-host disease and accumulation of HY-CD8 in secondary lymphoid tissues. Antileukemia responses, however, were preserved. In contrast, restriction of HY expression to hematopoietic tissues restored MB49 responses but resulted in a loss of antileukemia responses. We concluded that target alloantigen expression in the same compartment of tumor growth impairs CD8 responses to both solid and hematologic tumors.","['Copyright (c) 2014 American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation.

In this work, a new disposable electrochemical cell sensor with low cost and simple fabrication was proposed to study the electrochemical behavior of leukemia K562 cells and the effect of anticancer drugs on cell viability. The analytical device was integrated by using ITO glass as the substrate of working electrodes and paper as the electrolytic cell. The cyclic voltammetry of the K562 cells at the disposable electrode exhibited an irreversible anodic peak and the peak current is proportional to the cell number. This anodic peak is attributed to the oxidation of guanine in cells involving two protons per transfer of two electrons. For the drug sensitivity tests, arsenic trioxide and cyclophosphamide were added to cell culture media. As a result, the electrochemical responses of the K562 cells decreased significantly. The cytotoxicity curves and results obtained corresponded well with the results of CCK-8 assays. In comparison to conventional methods, the proposed method is simple, rapid and inexpensive. More importantly, the developed sensor is supposed to be a single-use disposable device and electrodes were prepared ""as new"" for each experiment.

Here, we propose a polymeric nanoparticle (PNP) system consisting of two amphiphilic diblock copolymers which allow for the rapid determination of structure-activity relationships involving gene knockdown and toxicity. The diblock copolymers self-assemble into monodisperse micelles of defined hydrodynamic diameters ranging from 30 to 100 nm dependent on the copolymer ratio. A luciferase-based high throughput assay varying PNP composition, concentration and siRNA concentration allowed the rapid identification of efficient PNP formulations for adherent and suspension cell lines. Optimised PNPs efficiently knocked down a fusion oncogene in hard to transfect human leukaemic cells raising the possibility of targeting malignant cells in a cancer-specific fashion.

This study investigates the molecular mechanisms that govern the initiation of the involution process by examining the signaling events that occur as the uterus transitions from the pregnant to postnatal state. Using mouse and baboon uteri, we found a remarkable cross-species conservation at the signal transduction level as the pregnant uterus initiates and progresses through the involution process. This study originated with the observation of elevated levels of caspase-3 activation in both the laboring mouse and baboon uterus, which we found to be apoptotic in nature as evidenced by the concurrent appearance of cleaved poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase. We previously defined a nonapoptotic and potential tocolytic role for uterine caspase-3 during pregnancy regulated by increased antiapoptotic signaling mediated by myeloid cell leukemia sequence 1 and X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis. In contrast, this study determined that diminished antiapoptotic signaling in the postpartum uterus allowed for both endometrial apoptotic and myometrial autophagic episodes, which we speculate are responsible for the rapid reduction in size of the postpartum uterus. Using our human telomerase immortalized myometrial cell line and the Simian virus-40 immortalized endometrial cell line (12Z), we demonstrated that the withdrawal of antiapoptotic signaling was also an upstream event for both the autophagic and apoptotic processes in the human uterine myocyte and endometrial epithelial cell.",,,,PMC3836074,,,"['R01 HD065011/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States', '1R01HD065011/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,

In this study, we investigated the effect of the periodontopathogen Porphyromonas gingivalis on P. aeruginosa-induced epithelial cell apoptosis. P. gingivalis invasion transiently inhibited P. aeruginosa-induced apoptosis in respiratory epithelial cells via the signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) signaling pathway. The activated STAT3 up-regulated the downstream anti-apoptotic moleculars survivin and B-cell leukemia-2 (bcl-2). This process was accompanied by down-regulation of pro-apoptosis molecular Bcl-2-associated death promoter (bad) and caspase-3 activity inhibition. In addition, the activation of the STAT3 pathway was affected by P. gingivalis in a dose-dependent manner. Finally, co-invasion of P. aeruginosa and P. gingivalis led to greater cell death compared with P. aeruginosa challenge alone. These results suggest that regulation of P. aeruginosa-induced apoptosis by P. gingivalis contributes to the pathogenesis of respiratory disease. Interference with this process may provide a potential therapeutic strategy for the treatment and prevention of respiratory disease.","['Copyright (c) 2013 Institut Pasteur.

It is a blood-borne disease characterized by persistent fever and joint pain. In the blood, primary peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), in particular monocytes, are the main target of the dengue virus (DENV). These cells are poorly permissive for in vitro dengue virus infection and their infectivity varies from donor to donor. To overcome this barrier, an anti-dengue antibody was used to improve the infectivity of DENV-2 clinical isolates to PBMCs, the monocytic leukemia cell line, THP-1 and the granulocyte cell line, KU812. A higher throughput 96-well-format assay based on a fluorescent-activated cell sorter could potentially be developed to evaluate the antiviral potency of compounds in DENV-infected PBMCs in vitro. The results correlate well with data obtained by a standard plaque assay. Altogether, an assay has been developed that enables evaluation of the antiviral activity of test compounds in a physiologically-relevant cell system (PBMCs).

Many of the challenges in treating T-ALL reflect the lack of prognostic cytogenetic or molecular abnormalities on which to base therapy, including targeted therapy. Notch1 activating mutations were identified in more than 50% of T-ALL cases and can be therapeutically targeted with gamma-secretase inhibitors (GSIs). Mutant Notch1 can activate cMyc and PI3K-AKT-mTOR1 signaling in T-ALL. In T-ALLs with wild-type phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome ten (PTEN), Notch1 transcriptionally represses PTEN, an effect reversible by GSIs. Notch1 also promotes growth factor receptor (IGF1R and IL7Ralpha) signaling to PI3K-AKT. Loss of PTEN is common in primary T-ALLs due to mutation or posttranslational inactivation and results in chronic activation of PI3K-AKT-mTOR1 signaling, GSI-resistance, and repression of p53-mediated apoptosis. Notch1 itself might regulate posttranslational inactivation of PTEN. PP2A is activated by Notch1 in PTEN-null T-ALL cells, and GSIs reduce PP2A activity and increase phosphorylation of AKT, AMPK, and p70S6K. This review focuses on the central role of the PI3K-AKT-mTOR1 signaling in T-ALL, including its regulation by Notch1 and potential therapeutic interventions, with emphasis on GSI-resistant T-ALL.",['(c) 2013.'],['NOTNLM'],"['5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide ribonucleotide', 'ADAM', 'AICAR', 'AKT', 'ALL', 'AML', 'AMPK', 'ANK', 'B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia', 'B-precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'BAD', 'BCL-2 associated death promoter', 'BCL-2 homology domain 3 (BH3)-only protein, B-cell lymphoma 2 interacting', 'mediator of cell death', 'BP-ALL', 'Bim', 'CAMKKbeta', 'CBF1/Su(H)/Lag-1', 'CDK8', 'CK2', 'CLL', 'CSL', 'DSL', 'Delta-like', 'Delta-Serrate-Lag1', 'Dll', 'EFS', 'EGF', 'ERK', 'F-box/WD-repeat containing protein 7', 'FBW7', 'FOXO', 'GSC', 'GSI', 'GSK3', 'HD', 'Hes1', 'ICN1', 'IGF1R', 'IGFBP3', 'IL7Ralpha', 'IRS1', 'JME', 'Jag', 'Jagged', 'LKB1', 'LNR', 'Leukemia', 'Lin12/Notch1 repeats', 'MAML1', 'MAPK', 'MCL1', 'MDM2', 'NEC', 'NTM', 'Notch1', 'Notch1 extracellular domain', 'Notch1 transmembrane domain', 'PDK1', 'PEST', 'PI3K', 'PIP(2)', 'PIP(3)', 'PKCtheta', 'PP2A', 'PRAS40', 'PTEN', 'Pro, Glu, Ser, and Thr-rich domain', 'Protein phosphatase 2A', 'ROS', 'RUNX1 and RUNX3', 'Ser/Thr-protein phosphatase 2A', 'T-ALL', 'T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'TACE', 'TAN1', 'a disintegrin and metalloprotease', 'acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'acute myeloid leukemia', 'adenosine monophosphate (AMP) activated protein kinase', 'ankyrin-like repeats', 'calmodulin-dependent protein kinase kinase beta', 'casein kinase 2', 'cyclin-dependent kinase 8', 'eIF2A and eIF4E', 'epidermal growth factor', 'eukaryotic translation initiating factors 2A and 4E', 'event free survival', 'extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase', 'fork head box O transcription factors', 'glycogen synthase kinase 3', 'hairy and enhancer of split-1', 'heterodimerization domain', 'induced myeloid leukemia cell differentiation protein', 'insulin receptor substrate 1', 'insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor', 'insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 3', 'interleukin-7 receptor subunit alpha', 'intracellular domain of Notch1', 'juxtamembrane expansion', 'liver kinase B1', 'mSIN1', 'mTOR', 'mammalian stress-activated protein kinase interacting protein 1', 'mammalian target of rapamycin', 'mastermind-like protein 1', 'miR/miRNA', 'micro-RNA', 'mitogen activate protein kinases', 'mouse double minute 2 homolog', 'phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome ten', 'phosphatidylinositide 3-kinase', 'phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)-trisphosphate', 'phosphatidylinositol (4,5)-bisphosphate', 'phosphoinositide dependent protein kinase-1', 'proline-rich AKT substrate 40kDa', 'protein kinase B (PKB)', 'protein kinase C theta', 'rapamycin-insensitive companion of mTOR', 'raptor', 'reactive oxygen species', 'regulatory-associated protein of mTOR', 'rictor', 'runt-related transcription factors 1 and 3', 'translocation associated Notch1 homolog', 'tumor necrosis factor alpha-converting enzyme', 'gamma-Secretase inhibitor resistance', 'gamma-secretase complex', 'gamma-secretase complex inhibitors']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the effect of cucurbitacin D on immune cells is not fully understood although there is no toxic activity to normal cells.

Cucurbitacin D could increase LPS-induced interleukin (IL)-1beta production in culture supernatant of THP-1 cells, peritoneal exudate cells (PECs), bone marrow derived macrophages (BMDMs), and RAW264 cells. At the transcriptional level, cucurbitacin D enhanced LPS-induced IL-1beta mRNA expression through activation of ERK1/2 mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs). At the posttranscriptional level, the activation of caspase-1 induced by cucurbitacin D has also been demonstrated following treatment with a caspase-1 inhibitor and siRNA. Importantly, cucurbitacin D has further been shown to induce inflammasome activation independent of ERK1/2 activation. Western blotting showed interaction of NOD-like receptor family, pyrin domain containing 3 (NALP3) and apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a caspase-activating and recruitment domain (ASC), suggesting activation of the inflammasome and a possible reason for activation of caspase-1. Taken together, these results suggest that cucurbitacin D could initiate immunomodulating activity in macrophages to lead to inflammasome activation as well as enhancement of LPS signaling.",['(c) 2013.'],['NOTNLM'],"['ASC', 'BMDMs', 'Cucurbitacin D', 'ERK1/2', 'IL-1beta', 'Inflammasome', 'LDH', 'MAPKs', 'Macrophages', 'NALP3', 'NOD-like receptor family, pyrin domain containing 3', 'PECs', 'THMs', 'TLR', 'Toll-like receptor', 'apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a caspase-activating and', 'recruitment domain', 'bone marrow derived macrophages', 'lactate dehydrogenase', 'mitogen-activated protein kinases', 'peritoneal exudate cells', 'traditional medicinal herbs']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

These subtypes differ not only in their anatomic location, but in epidemiology, origin, etiology, pathogenesis, and treatment. The incidence and mortality of iCCA has been increasing over the past 3 decades, and only a low percentage of patients survive until 5 years after diagnosis. Geographic variations in the incidence of CCA are related to variations in risk factors. Changes in oncogene and inflammatory signaling pathways, as well as genetic and epigenetic alterations and chromosome aberrations, have been shown to contribute to the development of CCA. Furthermore, CCAs are surrounded by a dense stroma that contains many cancer-associated fibroblasts, which promotes their progression. We have gained a better understanding of the imaging characteristics of iCCAs and have developed advanced cytologic techniques to detect pCCAs. Patients with iCCAs usually are treated surgically, whereas liver transplantation after neoadjuvant chemoradiation is an option for a subset of patients with pCCAs.

All five cycle cancellations were in the post-chemotherapy group: three patients with leukaemia and two with lymphoma. Patients with prior chemotherapy had lower baseline antral follicle count (10 versus 22) and received more gonadotrophins to achieve similar peak oestradiol concentrations, with no difference in oocyte yield (10.5 versus 10) after adjustment for age. Embryo yield was similar between those who had prior chemotherapy and those who had not. Half of the patients with haematological diseases who present for fertility preservation have been exposed to chemotherapy.

In a phase I/IIa clinical trial, we treated 13 patients (median age, 37 years; range, 20 to 59 years) with hematologic malignancies: 7 patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia, 5 patients with acute myeloid leukemia, and 1 patient with chronic myeloid leukemia, who received conventional myeloablative conditioning, with 35, 70, 140, or 210 x 10(6) cell/kg of donor ApoCell, on day -1 of transplantation. Engraftment was successful in all patients with median time to neutrophil recovery of 13 days (range, 11 to 19), and platelet recovery of 15 days (range, 11 to 59). Serious adverse effects were reported on 10 occasions in the trial, all of which were considered unrelated (n = 7) or unlikely to be related (n = 3) to ApoCell infusion. The nonrelapse mortality at day 100 and 180 after transplantation was 7.7% and the overall survival at 100 and 180 days after transplantation was 92% and 85%, respectively. All ApoCell preparations showed an in vitro significant tolerogenic effect upon interaction with dendritic cells. The overall incidence of acute grades II to IV GVHD was 23%, whereas among those receiving the 2 higher doses (n = 6), the rate was 0%. These results suggest that a single infusion of donor ApoCell in HLA-matched allogeneic HSCT is a safe and potentially effective prophylaxis for acute GVHD occurring after myeloablative conditioning.

We thus explored the role of serum fetuin-A reflecting ectopic hepatic fat deposition when storage capacity of adipocytes has been exceeded, free leptin reflecting overall fat mass and adiponectin reflecting visceral fat mass, all potential mediators of the effects of obesity on insulin resistance and, consequently, to MDS risk. MATERIALS & METHODS: In a hospital-based case-control study, we studied 101 cases with incident, histologically confirmed primary MDS and 101 controls matched on gender, age and date of diagnosis, between 2004 and 2007. Serum fetuin-A, adiponectin, leptin, leptin receptor, free leptin and insulin were determined. RESULTS: Higher serum fetuin-A, lower adiponectin and lower free leptin were all individually and independently associated with higher risk of MDS before and after controlling for matching and risk factors, such as age, gender, date of diagnosis, body mass index (BMI), family history of lymphohematopoietic cancer, smoking history and serum insulin. Interestingly, we have shown that these associations were prominent among overweight/obese individuals and persisted after controlling for BMI and serum insulin indicating that their effects are above and beyond insulinemia only. CONCLUSION: Elevated serum fetuin-A but lower adiponectin and free leptin are associated with higher risk of MDS particularly among overweight/obese individuals. These findings suggest that the association between excessive weight gain and the risk of MDS could be mediated by fetuin-A, adiponectin and free leptin, which may have potential clinical and preventive implications.",['(c) 2013.'],['NOTNLM'],"['AML', 'Acute Myeloid Leukemia', 'BM', 'BMI', 'Body Mass Index', 'CMML', 'Cancer', 'FAB', 'FLI', 'French American British Classification', 'HGF', 'IL-6', 'IPSS', 'IR', 'Insulin', 'Insulin resistance', 'International Prognostic Scoring System', 'LHC', 'Leukemia', 'MDS', 'Mets', 'Obesity', 'RA', 'RAEB', 'RAEB-t', 'RARS', 'TGF-beta', 'TNF-alpha', 'Tumor Growth Factor-beta.', 'bone marrow', 'chronic myelomonocytic leukemia', 'free leptin index', 'hepatocyte growth factor', 'insulin resistance', 'interleukin-6', 'leptin receptor', 'lymphohematopoietic cancer', 'metabolic syndrome', 'myelodysplastic syndrome', 'refractory anemia', 'refractory anemia with excess blasts', 'refractory anemia with excess blasts in transformation', 'refractory anemia with ring sideroblasts', 'sOB-R', 'tumor necrosis factor-alpha']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Inhibiting angiogenesis pathway has long been remained a significant hope for the development of novel, effective and target orientated antitumor agents arresting the tumor proliferation and metastasis. The process of neoangiogenesis as a biological process is regulated by several pro- and anti-angiogenic factors, especially vascular endothelial growth factor, fibroblast growth factor, epidermal growth factor, hypoxia inducible factor 1 and transforming growth factor. Every endothelial cell destined for vessel formation is equipped with receptors for these angiogenic peptides. Moreover, numerous other angiogenic cytokines such as platelet derived growth factor (PGDF), placenta growth factor (PGF), nerve growth factor (NGF), stem-cell factor (SCF), and interleukins-2, 4, 6 etc. These molecular players performs critical role in regulating the angiogenic switch. Couple of decade's research in molecular aspects of tumor biology has unraveled numerous structural and functional mysteries of these angiogenic peptides. In present article, a detailed update on the functional and structural peculiarities of the various angiogenic peptides is described focusing on structural opportunities made available that has potential to be used to modulate function of these angiogenic peptides in developing therapeutic agents targeting neoplastic angiogenesis. The data may be useful in the mainstream of developing novel anticancer agents targeting tumor angiogenesis.

In this report, we examined the effect of the NF-kappaB inhibitor dehydroxymethylepoxyquinomicin (DHMEQ) and its combinational use with the DNMT inhibitor 5-azacytidine (AZA) in ML cell lines. DHMEQ alone induced cell death in ML cell lines with NF-kappaB activation, although the response varied among the cell lines. The addition of DHMEQ enhanced the effect of AZA on the viability and apoptosis induction of ML cell lines. The treatment of ML cell lines with AZA marginally induced NF-kappaB binding activity, although the treatment induced NF-kappaB protein.

Investigating the monocyte depletion observed during HTLV-1 infection, we discovered that primary human monocytes infected with HTLV-1 undergo abortive infection accompanied by apoptosis dependent on SAMHD1, a host restriction factor that hydrolyzes endogenous dNTPs to below the levels required for productive reverse transcription. Reverse transcription intermediates (RTI) produced in the presence of SAMHD1 induced IRF3-mediated antiviral and apoptotic responses. Viral RTIs complexed with the DNA sensor STING to trigger formation of an IRF3-Bax complex leading to apoptosis. This study provides a mechanistic explanation for abortive HTLV-1 infection of monocytes and reports a link between SAMHD1 restriction, HTLV-1 RTI sensing by STING, and initiation of IRF3-Bax driven apoptosis.",['Copyright (c) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

BLV usually causes asymptomatic infections in cattle, but only one-third develop persistent lymphocytosis that rarely progress after a long incubation period to lymphoid tumors, namely enzootic bovine leucosis (EBL). In the present study, we demonstrated that the BLV tax genes could be divided into two alleles and developed multiplex PCR detecting an L233P mutation of the Tax protein. Then, in order to define the relationship between the Tax protein and leukemogenicity, we examined 360 tumor samples randomly collected from dairy or breeding cattle in Japan, of which Tax proteins were categorized, for age at the time of diagnosis of EBL. The ages of 288 animals (80.0%) associated with L233-Tax and those of 70 animals (19.4%) with P233-Tax individually followed log-normal distributions. Only the two earliest cases (0.6%) with L233-Tax disobeyed the log-normal distribution. These findings suggest that the animals affected by EBL were infected with the virus at a particular point in life, probably less than a few months after birth. Median age of those with P233-Tax was 22 months older than that with L233-Tax and geometric means exhibited a significant difference (P<0.01). It is also quite unlikely that viruses carrying the particular Tax protein infect older cattle. Here, we conclude that BLV could be divided into two categories on the basis of amino acid at position 233 of the Tax protein, which strongly correlated with leukemogenicity.",['Copyright (c) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) from mice lacking aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) have high rates of cell division. Studies were designed to test the hypothesis that aging AhR-null allele (AhR-KO) mice develop premature HSC exhaustion, and changes leading to hematological disease. Compared to wild-type, aging AhR-KO mice showed a decreased survival rate, splenomegaly, increased circulating white blood cells, hematopoietic cell accumulation in tissues, and anemia. Analysis of bone marrow indicated increased numbers of stem/progenitor and lineage-committed cells, but decreased erythroid progenitors. There was also decreased self-renewal capacity of HSCs determined by competitive repopulation and serial transplantation. HSCs also showed increased levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS), Ki-67, and gamma-H2A.X, but decreased p16(Ink4a). Splenic cells from aging KO mice had abnormal expression of genes, including Gata-1, Sh2d3c, Gfi-1, p21, and c-myc, involved in trafficking and associated with leukemia. HSCs from AhR-KO mice had gene changes related to HSC maintenance and consistent with phenotype observed. The most prominent gene changes (overexpression of Srpk2, Creb1, Hes1, mtor, pdp1) have been associated with HSC hyperproliferation, leukemia, and accelerated aging. Pathway analyses also indicated an enrichment of genes associated with oxidative stress, acute myelogenous leukemia, aging, and heat shock response, and the beta-catenin/Wnt pathways. These data indicate that loss of AhR and associated changes in multiple signaling pathways promote premature HSC exhaustion and development of a myeloproliferative disorder.

Risk grouping using the MK criteria shows a highly significant difference in 5-yr overall survival (OS) ranging between 67%, for the most favorable, and 32%, for the poorest risk group (P = 0.001). Although similarly precise in predicting OS, the MK scheme better separates patients with respect to relapse incidence as compared to the SWOG/ECOG grouping (P = 0.0001 vs. P = 0.01). Notably, patients displaying non-MK abnormalities (MK-) had a 5-yr relapse incidence identical to those cytogenetically normal (CN), that is 24%. Multivariate analysis revealed that the MK classification is an independent prognosticator and superior in predicting OS (hazard ratios, HR 3.74, P = 0.01) and relapse incidence (HR 3.74, P = 0.005) as compared to the SWOG/ECOG criteria. Finally, subgroup analysis revealed that the prognostic capacity of the MK classification is highly significant in patients treated with standard myeloablative conditioning prior to alloSCT (P = 0.0011 for OS, P = 0.0007 for relapse). In contrast, the MK grouping failed to predict OS or relapse incidence in patients treated with reduced intensity conditioning. Taken together, these results indicate that the MK classification is superior in predicting the overall outcome of patients with AML undergoing alloSCT in CR. Furthermore, our data suggest that the genetic risk profile of MK- and CN patients is mostly overlapping in this setting.",['(c) 2013 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

The purpose of this study was to compare the usefulness of FISH and CBA for detecting CE and to evaluate its influence on clinical outcome. FISH and CBA were performed at two time points: baseline and follow-up. Thirty-eight previously untreated patients with CLL were included in this study. CBA and I-FISH revealed CE in 15 (39.5%) and 10 (26.3%) patients, respectively. High-risk CE was detected in six cases by CBA and in five cases by I-FISH. In four cases with CE-dependent 17p abnormalities detected by CBA, metaphase FISH was needed for the confirmation of 17p13.1 deletion. Time from first-line to second-line treatment (TTST) and overall survival (OS) did not differ between patients with and without CE, irrespective of the CE-detecting method used. However, shorter OS (P = 0.043) and TTST (P = 0.006) were observed for the patients with potentially relevant CE (rCE) detected by CBA, in which acquired aberrations were present in at least 20% of undivided cells and/or changed baseline karyotype to abnormal or complex and were not resulting from 13q deletion. Our results suggest that some, but not all, CE-dependent aberrations detected by CBA influence clinical outcome.

In this study we introduce KGI, which is a nanoparticle with a Quillaja saponin as an active molecule. By the use of RNA array analysis and confirmation at the protein level, we show that KGI affects myeloid leukemia cells (in particular, the U937 monoblast cancer cell) by the following mechanisms: (A) ceasing cell replication via proteasome degradation, (B) down-regulation of key molecules at check points between G1/S and G2/M phases, (C) reduction of thymidine kinase activity, followed by (D) exit to differentiation and production of interleukin-8 (IL-8), eventually leading to apoptosis. Leukemia cell lines (U937 and HL-60 cells) were exposed to KGI for 8 h, after which the drug was removed. The cancer cells did not revert to replication over the following 10 days.

The aim of this study was to explore the association of miR-29c expression with clinical parameters and survival in 53 Chinese patients with CLL. We showed that the miR-29c expression level decreased significantly from early to advanced clinical stages, and was significantly lower in patients with beta(2)-microglobulin higher than 3.5 mg/L or with disease progression or death. With the cut-off determined by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis, optimizing concordance with immunoglobulin heavy chain (IgVH) mutation status, miR-29c negative and positive groups were defined as including 17 and 36 patients, respectively. The miR-29c negative group had a higher percentage of patients with trisomy 12 or deletion of 11q or 17p (70.6% vs. 34.3%; p = 0.014) compared to the miR-29c positive group. The median progression-free survival and overall survival of the miR-29c negative group were 21 and 92 months, respectively, significantly shorter than in the miR-29c positive group (both not reached; p = 0.002 and p = 0.042, respectively), and miR-29c down-regulation was an independent prognostic factor for PFS.

SUBJECTS AND METHODS: The results of AS treatment with ESAs were analyzed in 48 patients with LPD. A study group comprised patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (n=1 3), indolent lymphomas (n=14), and multiple myeloma (n=21). Their hemograms (hemoglobin concentration, red blood cells, packed cell volume, reticulocytes, and platelets) and blood EE and TNF-alpha levels were examined before using ESAs. The hemogram was monitored during treatment. ESAs (eralfon (epoietin alpha) in 21 patients and epres in 27) were subcutaneously injected in a dose of 150 IU/kg thrice weekly (for not more than 16 weeks). A control group included 21 anemic patients with multiple myeloma who did not receive ESAs. Increasing hemoglobin concentrations up to 120 g/l was regarded as a positive response to ESA treatment. RESULTS: By and large, the efficacy of epoietin alpha was 62.5% (61.9% for eralfon and 63.0% for epres), which was significantly higher than that in the control group (23.4%; p<0.05). A number of blood laboratory parameters were found to be of value in predicting the efficacy of ESAs. The patients with the decreased baseline concentrations o EE ( <130 mlU/ml) and TNF- alfa (,15 pg/ml) were ascertained to show a positive response more frequently (80 and 92.9%, respectively; p<0.05) than those with thepredicting the efficacy of ESAs. The patients with the decreased baseline concentrations of EE (<130 mlU/ml) and TNF-a (<15 elevated concentrations of the enzymes in question. In addition, a positive response was more often recorded in patients with reticulocyte counts of more than 1% (77.4%; p<0.05) and platelets of 100-10(9)/1 (70%; p=0.05). CONCLUSION: Estimating the baseline blood levels of EE and TNF-a and the counts of reticulocytes and platelets prior to the use of ESAs enables prediction of the efficiency of erythropoiesis-stimulating therapy in anemic patients with LPD.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

SUBJECTS AND METHODS: The results of diagnosis and treatment were analyzed in 70 patients with different immunological variants of T-ALL treated in the Russian multicenter trial. RESULTS: Out of the 70 patients with T-ALL, its early immunotype was determined in 32 (45.7%) cases, the thymic and mature immunotypes were found in 31 (44.3%) and 7 (10%) cases, respectively. The median age of the patients with T-ALL was 28 (ranged from 15 to 54) years; men were twice more than women (48 and 22, respectively). Bone marrow lesion was noted in all the patients with early T-ALL and in 80% of the patients with thymic and mature T-ALL. The enlarged mediastinum was significantly more frequently detected in mature T-ALL (100%) than in its early (53.4%) and thymic (60.7%) variants. Therapeutic effectiveness was evaluated in 58 patients. An analysis was made in January 2013. Induction therapy resulted in complete remission in 49 (84.5%) patients. The refractory course of the disease was recorded in 5 (8.6%) cases; early death was in 4 (6.9%). The rate of complete remission in thymic T-ALL, unlike in the early (72%) and mature (71.4%) variants, was significantly higher (100%) due to the absence of resistant forms and early mortality. Moreover, it should be noted that only the patients with early T-ALL (16%) died during the induction phase. In the patients with different variants of T-ALL, the overall and relapse-free survival rates were not significantly different, accounting for 67.2 and 76.2%, respectively. Multivariate analysis revealed no prognostically unfavorable factors that determined long-term results. CONCLUSION: The ALL-2009 protocol is reproducible in any regions of the Russian Federation and highly efficient in treating patients with T-ALL.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Subjects and methods. The results of a cytogenetic analysis of the total population of BM cells (BMC), CD34+ hematopoietic progenitor cells from BM and PB, and BM MSCs were analyzed in 35 patients (29 patients with MDS and 6 with MDS transformed into acute myeloid leukemia (AML)) and 7 healthy BM donors. Cytogenetic examinations were performed by G-banding of chromosomes and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). RESULTS: The BMC karyotype was abnormal in 17 (49%) of the 35 patients (13 with MDS and 4 with AML); the others were found to have a normal BM karyotype. The FISH analysis confirmed the same cytogenetic abnormalities in the BM and PB CD34+ hematopoietic progenitor cells in all the examinees with an abnormal karyotype. The mean abnormal clone sizes in the total population of BMCs and BM and PB CD34+ progenitor cells did not differ and constituted 65.8, 73.1, and 74.8%, respectively. The patients with a normal BM karyotype had no chromosome abnormalities in the CD34+ cells either. The karyotype of MSCs was analyzed in 23 (19 with MDS and 4 with AML) of the 35 patients. No karyotype abnormalities were revealed in the patients with MDS transformed into AML. There were structural chromosome aberrations in 2 (11%) of the 19 patients with MDS (one with constitutional inv(9)(p1 3q21) was found to have non-clonal translocation t(2;22)(p10;q1 1) and the other had a clone with an additional segment of the long arm of chromosome 2 in 35% of the cells. No numerical MSC karyotype abnormalities were detected. A normal MSC karyotype was defined in 7 healthy BM donors. CONCLUSION: The cytogenetic analysis of hematopoietic and mesenchymal progenitor cells showed that the chromosome abnormalities revealed in these cell populations were different in the patients with MDS. The isolated CD34+ cells displayed the same cytogenetic abnormalities as in a total population of BMC. Examination of the latter could reveal no cytogenetic abnormalities in the majority of the patients. A normal BMC karyotype was detectable in the patients with AML. Two (11%) patients with MDS were found to have structural chromosome abnormalities that differed from those detected in the total population of BMC and in isolated CD34+ cells. The differences of chromosome abnormalities in the hematopoietic and mesenchymal progenitor cells point to the fact that the stromal microenvironment is not part of the abnormal clone in MDS, however, it may be of great importance in the pathogenesis of the disease.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Data from 118 patients with malignant blood diseases were analyzed. Allo-HSCTs from HLA-matched related donors (n=49), HLA-matched unrelated donors (n=50), partially HLA-matched unrelated donors (n=2), and haploidentical donors (n=24) were performed. The indications for DLI were underlying disease relapse (59 DLIs), resistant disease course (n=40), minimal residual disease (n=1 6), falling donor chimerism (n=1 5), and recurrence prevention (n=1 3). RESULTS: Therapy response was obtained after 57 (44%) DLls. There were 36 (25%) and 30 (21%) cases of acute and chronic graft-versus-host reactions (GVHR), respectively. The use of DLI from HLA-matched donors, its performance in the periods of D+100 to one year after allo-HSCT, a donor chimerism level of over 90% at the moment of DLI, the administration of the initial DLI dose of below 1.10(6) CD3+/kg, and the development of chronic GVHR after DLI were associated with the highest rate of therapy responses. The overall survival rates of patients with DLI were significantly influenced by factors, such as DLI periods, donor chimerism levels at DLI, and the development of chronic CVHR after DLI. CONCLUSION: The choice of the optimal dose of cells, the periods of DLI and its preventive administration improve prognosis in patients after allo-HSCT. The occurrence of acute GVHR is affected by the degree of HLA matching and the type of a donor. The development of chronic GVHR after DLI is associated with the highest rate of responses to DLI and higher survival rates.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The patients classified in the low-, intermediate-, and high-risk groups were 30, 46.7; and 23.3%, respectively. The analysis was made in January 2013. RESULTS: The number of patients who achieved complete remission, as well as the mortality rates during remission induction were wholly comparable to those previously obtained when using the 7+3+ATRA protocol: 90.3 and 9.7%, respectively. One patient in remission died (3.6% mortality rate). The likelihood of recurrence in this investigation was high (21%), which was due to gross noncompliance with maintenance therapy. On examining the clearance of the malignant clone by FISH and polymerase chain reaction, a naturally chimeric transcript identified by a molecular study was statistically significantly more frequently revealed during postinduction therapy, which was associated with different sensitivity of the techniques. Comparison of changes in the disappearance of a chimeric marker for APL with the AIDA and 7+3+ARTA programs showed that the clearance of the malignant clone was much slower. CONCLUSION: The AIDA program is a highly effective treatment protocol for patients with APL.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Due to their higher life expectancy, the number of patients is on the increase and their quality of life and working capacity remain good. According to the All-Russian Register of Chronic Myeloid Leukemia, there were more than 6500 cases in the Russian Federation in 2012. Of them, 93.1% were diagnosed with the chronic phase of the disease, 6.4 and 0.4% with its accelerated phase and blast crisis, respectively. Among the BCR-ABL TK inhibitors (TKI) registered in the Russian Federation and recommended for the treatment of chronic myeloid leukemia, there are 3 medications: imatinib, nilotinib, and dasatinib. The efficiency and safety of TKI therapy have been well studied. The most important principle of treatment is to permanently affect the Ph'-positive tumor cell clone by the long-term daily use of TKls. Regular cytogenetic and molecular genetic monitoring allows adequate estimation of the leukemic clone volume and it is essential in evaluating the therapeutic effectiveness. To choose a TKI for each specific patient with regard for its best tolerability and maximum efficiency permits individualized treatment.

METHODS: A postal survey of 114 562 Vietnam veterans was conducted. The perceived exposure to Agent Orange was assessed by a 6-item questionnaire. Two proximity-based Agent Orange exposure indices were constructed using division/brigade-level and battalion/company-level unit information. Adjusted odds ratios (ORs) for age and other confounders were calculated using a logistic regression model. RESULTS: The prevalence of all self-reported diseases showed monotonically increasing trends as the levels of perceived self-reported exposure increased. The ORs for colon cancer (OR, 1.13), leukemia (OR, 1.56), hypertension (OR, 1.03), peripheral vasculopathy (OR, 1.07), enterocolitis (OR, 1.07), peripheral neuropathy (OR, 1.07), multiple nerve palsy (OR, 1.14), multiple sclerosis (OR, 1.24), skin diseases (OR, 1.05), psychotic diseases (OR, 1.07) and lipidemia (OR, 1.05) were significantly elevated for the high exposure group in the division/brigade-level proximity-based exposure analysis, compared to the low exposure group. The ORs for cerebral infarction (OR, 1.08), chronic bronchitis (OR, 1.05), multiple nerve palsy (OR, 1.07), multiple sclerosis (OR, 1.16), skin diseases (OR, 1.05), and lipidemia (OR, 1.05) were significantly elevated for the high exposure group in the battalion/company-level analysis. CONCLUSIONS: Korean Vietnam veterans with high exposure to Agent Orange experienced a higher prevalence of several self-reported chronic diseases compared to those with low exposure by proximity-based exposure assessment. The strong positive associations between perceived self-reported exposure and all self-reported diseases should be evaluated with discretion because the likelihood of reporting diseases was directly related to the perceived intensity of Agent Orange exposure.",,['NOTNLM'],"['Agent Orange', 'Herbicides', 'Korea', 'Prevalence', 'Veterans', 'Vietnam War']",PMC3796647,,,,,,,,,,,,

The present study investigated the impact of nm23-H1 gene expression on the proliferation and migration of the CML K562 cell line to elucidate the association between nm23-H1 gene expression and CML cell survival. An RNAi lipo-recombinant plasmid of the nm23-H1 gene (pGCsi-nm23-H1) was constructed and transfected into the K562 cells. RT-PCR and western blotting were used to detect nm23-H1 mRNA and protein expression, respectively. The anchorage-independent growth ability of the transfected cells was observed in soft agar culture and the ability of the K562 cells to migrate was determined using a Transwell assay. Following the successful construction and transfection of the pGCsi-nm23-H1 plasmid into the K562 cells, nm23-H1 mRNA and protein expression levels were significantly lower compared with the control group. The stably-transfected pGCsi-nm23-H1 K562 cells exhibited a markedly increased ability to form colonies and the number and sizes of the colonies were significantly increased compared with those of the control. In vitro, the cells migrated through a Matrigel-coated membrane during incubation for 20 h. The Transwell assay revealed that the quantitative number of pGCsi-nm23-H1 K562 cells that migrated into the lower compartment of the invasion chamber was markedly increased compared with the control.

However, little is known about the roles of Notch ligands in the survival or drug resistance of T-ALL cells. In the present study, isolated mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) from human umbilical cord (hUC) samples, termed hUC-MSCs, were used as stromal cells for the Jurkat T-ALL cell line. The role of the Notch ligand, Jagged1, was assessed in the survival of Jurkat T-ALL cells using this co-culture system. hUC-MSCs and Jurkat cells were observed to express Jagged1. Furthermore, co-culture with hUC-MSCs led to a significant upregulation of Jagged1 and a more significant overexpression of its receptor, Notch1, in the Jurkat cells, indicating that the receptor and ligand pair may play a role in the reciprocal or autonomous activation of the Notch pathway. In addition, a higher level of CD28 expression was observed in the Jurkat cells that were co-cultured with hUC-MSCs. Blocking Jagged1 expression using neutralizing antibodies restored drug-induced apoptosis in the Jurkat cells that were co-cultured with hUC-MSCs, and also increased the drug sensitivity of the Jurkat cells that were cultured alone.

Samples from 122 ALL patients and 35 non-ALL control patients were collected in this study. RT-PCR was performed to detect the mRNA expression of WWOX, FHIT and p73. The methylation status of the WWOX promoter region, FHIT promoter region and the first exon region of p73 were also analyzed using the methylation-specific PCR method. The mRNA expression of WWOX, FHIT and p73 was significantly lower in the ALL samples compared with the controls (48.2, 42.9 and 55.4%, respectively). By contrast, the methylation frequency of WWOX, FHIT and p73 was significantly higher in the ALL samples compared with the controls (44.6, 46.4 and 37.5%, respectively). The mRNA expression of these three genes was inversely correlated with the methylation frequency in the ALL samples (correlation coefficients, -0.661, -0.685 and -0.536 for WWOX, FHIT and p73, respectively). Moreover, the mRNA expression of WWOX was positively correlated with that of FHIT and p73 (correlation coefficients, 0.569 and 0.556, respectively). However, the methylation status of WWOX had no correlation with that of FHIT or p73. It was concluded that the high methylation status of WWOX, FHIT and p73 may lead to the inactivation of expression and the silencing of these genes, promoting the occurrence and development of ALL. The determination of the mRNA expression and methylation status of WWOX, FHIT and p73 may aid in the development of treatment approaches for ALL.",,['NOTNLM'],"['FHIT', 'WWOX', 'acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'mRNA expression', 'methylation', 'p73']",PMC3796419,,,,,,,,,,,,

APL has a unique and specific chromosomal aberration, t(15;17), which results in the formation of a fusion gene and protein PML/RARalpha, which is not only necessary for the diagnosis of APL, but is also critical for APL pathogenesis. In the present study, the cytotoxic effect of OA on NB4 cells was investigated. Cell viability was assessed via the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. The expression levels of bax and bcl-2 mRNA were determined by quantitative PCR. Apoptosis was analyzed using DNA fragment analysis and cell cycle distributions were analyzed by flow cytometry. The activity of caspase-3 and caspase-9 was determined by colorimetric assays. The expression of the PML/RARalpha fusion protein was analyzed by western blotting. The MTT assay showed that OA inhibited the proliferation of the NB4 cells. The expression levels of pro-apoptotic bax mRNA were increased and the levels of anti-apoptotic bcl-2 mRNA were decreased following the treatment of the NB4 cells with OA at 80 mumol/l. Treatment of the NB4 cells with OA at 80 mumol/l induced apoptosis and G1 phase arrest, while caspase-9 and caspase-3 activity was significantly increased. Furthermore, the expression of the PML/RARalpha fusion protein was decreased. Together, these data suggest that OA exerts a cytotoxic effect that inhibits proliferation and induces apoptosis in NB4 cells by targeting PML/RARalpha, making it a potent therapeutic agent against leukemia.",,['NOTNLM'],"['PML/RARalpha', 'acute promyelocytic leukemia', 'apoptosis', 'oleanolic acid']",PMC3796429,,,,,,,,,,,,

The present study describes the second documented case of a cutaneous SCC adjacent to a neurofibroma of the forehead with histopathological analyses in a patient with NF1. An 80-year-old female with NF1 presented with a rapidly growing skin tumor of the forehead. Histopathological study of the resected forehead tumor demonstrated that there were two tumorous lesions. One was an invasive SCC and the other was a neurofibroma. The lesions were adjacent, but no continuity was present. NF1 is caused by inactivating mutations in the NF1 gene and loss of heterozygosity of this gene has been reported in neurofibromas, malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors, gliomas and pheochromocytomas in patients with NF1.

We previously reported that in vivo adaptation of a noncarcinogenic H. pylori strain (B128) generated a derivative strain (7.13) with the ability to induce adenocarcinoma, providing a unique opportunity to define mechanisms that mediate gastric carcinogenesis. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small noncoding RNAs that regulate expression of oncogenes or tumor suppressors and are frequently dysregulated in carcinogenesis. To identify miRNAs and their targets involved in H. pylori-mediated carcinogenesis, miRNA microarrays were performed on RNA isolated from gastric epithelial cells cocultured with H. pylori strains B128, 7.13, or a 7.13 cagA(-) isogenic mutant. Among 61 miRNAs differentially expressed in a cagA-dependent manner, the tumor suppressor miR-320 was significantly downregulated by strain 7.13. Since miR-320 negatively regulates the antiapoptotic protein Mcl-1, we demonstrated that H. pylori significantly induced Mcl-1 expression in a cagA-dependent manner and that suppression of Mcl-1 results in increased apoptosis. To extend these results, mice were challenged with H. pylori strain 7.13 or its cagA(-) mutant; consistent with cell culture data, H. pylori induced Mcl-1 expression in a cagA-dependent manner.

The causal relationship remains unclear, however, due to limited evidence that FA induces toxicity in bone marrow, the site of leukemia induction, and in other distal organs. Although induction of DNA-protein crosslinks (DPC), a hallmark of FA toxicity, was not previously detected in the bone marrow of FA-exposed rats and monkeys in studies published in the 1980s, our recent studies showed increased DPC in the bone marrow, liver, kidney, and testes of exposed Kunming mice. To confirm these preliminary results, in the current study we exposed BALB/c mice to 0, 0.5, 1.0, and 3.0 mg m(-3) FA (8 hr per day, for 7 consecutive days) by nose-only inhalation and measured DPC levels in bone marrow and other organs of exposed mice. As oxidative stress is a potential mechanism of FA toxicity, we also measured glutathione (GSH), reactive oxygen species (ROS), and malondialdehyde (MDA), in the bone marrow, peripheral blood mononuclear cells, lung, liver, spleen, and testes of exposed mice. Significant dose-dependent increases in DPC, decreases in GSH, and increases in ROS and MDA were observed in all organs examined (except for DPC in lung). Bone marrow was among the organs with the strongest effects for DPC, GSH, and ROS. In conclusion, exposure of mice to FA by inhalation induced genotoxicity and oxidative stress in bone marrow and other organs. These findings strengthen the biological plausibility of FA-induced leukemogenesis and systemic toxicity.","['Copyright (c) 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']",['NOTNLM'],"['DPC', 'bone marrow toxicity', 'formaldehyde', 'leukemia', 'oxidative stress']",,,,['R01ES017452/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,

The activity of protein phosphatase-2A (PP2A), which regulates the phosphorylation of tau and neurofilaments, is negatively regulated by the myeloid leukemia-associated protein SET, also known as inhibitor-2 of PP2A, I2(PP2A). In AD brain, PP2A activity is compromised, probably because I2(PP2A) is overexpressed and is selectively cleaved at asparagine 175 into an N-terminal fragment, I2NTF, and a C-terminal fragment, I2CTF, and both fragments inhibit PP2A. Here, we analyzed the spinal cords from ALS and control cases for I2(PP2A) cleavage and PP2A activity. As observed in AD brain, we found a selective increase in the cleavage of I2(PP2A) into I2NTF and I2CTF and inhibition of the activity and not the expression of PP2A in the spinal cords of ALS cases. To test the hypothesis that both AD and ALS could be triggered by I2CTF, a cleavage product of I2(PP2A), we transduced by intracerebroventricular injections newborn rats with adeno-associated virus serotype 1 (AAV1) containing human I2CTF. AAV1-I2CTF produced reference memory impairment and tau pathology, and intraneuronal accumulation of Abeta by 5-8 months, and motor deficit and hyperphosphorylation and proliferation of neurofilaments, tau and TDP-43 pathologies, degeneration and loss of motor neurons and axons in the spinal cord by 10-14 months in rats.

However, several phase I/II clinical trials have shown limited benefits of this molecule. In the present work, we investigated whether cell susceptibility to TRAIL ligation could be due to the presence of TRAIL death receptors (DRs) 4 and 5 in membrane microdomains called lipid rafts. We performed a series of analyses, either by biochemical methods or fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) technique, on normal cells (i.e. lymphocytes, fibroblasts, endothelial cells), on a panel of human cancer B-cell lines as well as on CD19(+) lymphocytes from patients with B-chronic lymphocytic leukemia, treated with different TRAIL ligands, that is, recombinant soluble TRAIL, specific agonistic antibodies to DR4 and DR5, or CD34(+) TRAIL-armed cells. Irrespective to the expression levels of DRs, a molecular interaction between ganglioside GM3, abundant in lymphoid cells, and DR4 was detected. This association was negligible in all non-transformed cells and was strictly related to TRAIL susceptibility of cancer cells. Interestingly, lipid raft disruptor methyl-beta-cyclodextrin abrogated this susceptibility, whereas the chemotherapic drug perifosine, which induced the recruitment of TRAIL into lipid microdomains, improved TRAIL-induced apoptosis. Accordingly, in ex vivo samples from patients with B-chronic lymphocytic leukemia, the constitutive embedding of DR4 in lipid microdomains was associated per se with cell death susceptibility, whereas its exclusion was associated with TRAIL resistance. These results provide a key mechanism for TRAIL sensitivity in B-cell malignances: the association, within lipid microdomains, of DR4 but not DR5, with a specific ganglioside, that is the monosialoganglioside GM3. On these bases we suggest that lipid microdomains could exert a catalytic role for DR4-mediated cell death and that an ex vivo quantitative FRET analysis could be predictive of cancer cell sensitivity to TRAIL.",,,,PMC3920963,,,,,,,,,,,,

ON was diagnosed in 16 patients, of whom 15 were symptomatic. The cumulative incidence of ON was 0.76% in ALL941, 0.35% in ALL2000, and 3.6% in ALL2004. The incidence of ON in ALL941/2000, in which only prednisolone was administered as a steroid, was significantly lower than that in ALL2004, in which dexamethasone was used as a partial substitute for prednisolone (P<0.01). In ALL2004, sex and age were significantly correlated with the incidence of ON (1.3% in boys vs. 6.7% in girls, P=0.0132; 0.42% for age <10 y vs. 15.6% for age >/=10 y, P<0.0001), suggesting that girls aged 10 years and above are at a greater risk of ON onset. These results indicate that the risk of ON should be considered when administering dexamethasone as part of ALL protocol treatment in girls aged 10 years and above.",,,,PMC3872830,['Japanese Childhood Cancer and Leukemia Study Group (JCCLSG)'],,,,,,,,,,,

We analyzed the relation of the estimated external radiation exposure from the fallout to cancer incidence in Finland in 1988-2007. The study cohort comprised all approximately 3.8 million Finns who had lived in the same dwelling for 12 months following the accident (May 1986-April 1987). Radiation exposure was estimated using data from an extensive mobile dose rate survey. Cancer incidence data were obtained for the cohort divided into four exposure categories (the lowest with the first-year committed dose <0.1 mSv and the highest >/= 0.5 mSv) allowing for a latency of 5 years for leukemia and thyroid cancer, and 10 years for other cancers. Of the eight predefined cancer sites regarded as radiation-related from earlier studies, only colon cancer among women showed an association with exposure from fallout [excess rate ratio per increment in exposure category 0.06, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.02-0.11]. No such effect was observed for men, or other cancer sites. Our analysis of a large cohort over two decades did not reveal an increase in cancer incidence following the Chernobyl accident, with the possible exception of colon cancer among women. The largely null findings are consistent with extrapolation from previous studies suggesting that the effect is likely to remain too small to be empirically detectable and of little public health impact.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Objectives of this study included CR rate, leukemia-free survival (LFS) and toxicity of the regimen in adults. We report the outcome of 19 patients (19-51 years of age) treated prospectively on the study, as well as a subsequent cohort of 31 patients (18-53 years of age) treated off the study. Thirteen of 19 (68%) patients from the initial prospective study achieved CR, and the median overall survival (OS) of these 13 CR patients was 10.3 months. The median OS and LFS of all 19 patients were 5.6 and 4.3 months, respectively. The regimen was well tolerated, and no grade 4 non-hematological toxicity was observed.

Analysis of the diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) translatome revealed selective upregulation of mRNAs encoding anti-apoptotic and DNA repair proteins. We show that enhanced synthesis of these proteins in DLBCL is mediated by the relief of repression that is normally imposed by structure in the 5'-untranslated regions of their corresponding mRNAs. This process is driven by signaling through mammalian target of rapamycin, resulting in increased synthesis of eukaryotic initiation factor (eIF) 4B complex (eIF4B), a known activator of the RNA helicase eIF4A. Reducing eIF4B expression alone is sufficient to decrease synthesis of proteins associated with enhanced tumor cell survival, namely DAXX, BCL2 and ERCC5. Importantly, eIF4B-driven expression of these key survival proteins is directly correlated with patient outcome, and eIF4B, DAXX and ERCC5 are identified as novel prognostic markers for poor survival in DLBCL.

PML, a nuclear transcription factor, has a RING finger domain with densely positioned cysteine residues. To examine PML-modulated cellular responses to iAs(3+), CHO-K1 and HEK293 cells were each used to establish cell lines that expressed ectopic human PML. Overexpression of PML increased susceptibility to iAs(3+) in CHO-K1 cells, but not in HEK293 cells. Exposure of PML-transfected cells to iAs(3+) caused PML to change from a soluble form to less soluble forms, and this modification of PML was observable even with just 0.1 muM iAs(3+) (7.5 ppb). Western blot and immunofluorescent microscopic analyses revealed that the biochemical changes of PML were caused at least in part by conjugation with small ubiquitin-like modifier proteins (SUMOylation). A luciferase reporter gene was used to investigate whether modification of PML was caused by oxidative stress or activation of antioxidant response element (ARE) in CHO-K1 cells. Modification of PML protein occurred faster than activation of the ARE in response to iAs(3+), suggesting that PML was not modified as a consequence of oxidative stress-induced ARE activation.",['(c) 2013.'],['NOTNLM'],"['Arsenic', 'ICP-MS', 'Oxidative stress', 'Promyelocytic leukemia', 'SUMO', 'Western blot']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

In our preliminary studies, it was found that bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) were abnormal in patients with psoriasis. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are not only present in the bone marrow, but can also be separated from the skin.We reasoned that an investigation into the biological characteristics of MSCs in psoriatic skin lesions could more realistically reflect the actual conditions for the pathogenesis of psoriasis. OBJECTIVE: To reveal whether MSCs in psoriatic skin lesions are abnormal. METHODS: We obtained MSCs from psoriatic skin lesions and healthy human skin and identified these cells using flow cytometry and a cell differentiation assay; cytokine concentrations in the culture supernatants were measured with the ELISA assay. We compared cytokine concentrations in culture supernatants of MSCs derived from psoriatic skin lesions as well as those from healthy human skin. RESULTS: Compared with healthy control skintissue, in psoriatic skin lesions, MSC secretion of EGF, SCF, and IL-11 increased; secretion of bFGF, IL-3, IL-6, IL-8, and HGF decreased (p<0.05); and secretion of VEGF, M-CSF, G-CSF, GM-CSF, LIF, IL-1, IL-7, IL-10, and TNF-alpha showed no significant difference (p>0.05). Surface markers and the differentiation capacity of cells from the two sources were similar. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated that MSCs derived from psoriatic skin lesions had abnormalities, which may be one of the pathogenic mechanisms of psoriasis.",,['NOTNLM'],"['cytokine secretion', 'mesenchymal stem cells', 'psoriasis', 'skin lesions']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the present study, we examined the possibility of interaction between human ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter ABCB1 and four guanidine alkaloids isolated from P. nitens (i.e., galegine, nitensidine A, pterogynidine, and pterogynine) using human T cell lymphoblast-like leukemia cell line CCRF-CEM and its multi-drug resistant (MDR) counterpart CEM/ADR5000. In XTT assays, CEM/ADR5000 cells were resistant to the four guanidine alkaloids compared to CCRF-CEM cells, although the four guanidine alkaloids exhibited some level of cytotoxicity against both CCRF-CEM and CEM/ADR5000 cells. In ATPase assays, three of the four guanidine alkaloids were found to stimulate the ATPase activity of ABCB1. Notably, nitensidine A was clearly found to stimulate the ATPase activity of ABCB1 as strongly as the control drug, verapamil. Furthermore, the cytotoxic effect of nitensidine A on CEM/ADR5000 cells was synergistically enhanced by verapamil. Nitensidine A inhibited the extrusion of calcein by ABCB1. In the present study, the possibility of interaction between ABCB1 and two synthetic nitensidine A analogs (nitensidine AT and AU) were examined to gain insight into the mechanism by which nitensidine A stimulates the ATPase activity of ABCB1. The ABCB1-dependent ATPase activity stimulated by nitensidine A was greatly reduced by substituting sulfur (S) or oxygen (O) for the imino nitrogen atom (N) in nitensidine A. Molecular docking studies on human ABCB1 showed that, guanidine alkaloids from P. nitens dock to the same binding pocket as verapamil. Nitensidine A and its analogs exhibit similar binding energies to verapamil. Taken together, this research clearly indicates that nitensidine A is a novel substrate for ABCB1. The present results also suggest that the number, binding site, and polymerization degree of the isoprenyl moiety in the guanidine alkaloids and the imino nitrogen atom cooperatively contribute to their stimulation of ABCB1's ATPase activity.",['Copyright (c) 2013 Elsevier GmbH.

Epub 2013 Sep 8.,,"OBJECTIVE: We review the English literature between 1980 and 2013 and summarize the clinical classification, aetiology, physiology, and pathophysiology of paediatric priapism. We propose a clinical guideline for the management of priapism in children. PATIENTS: Male patients aged </= 18 years. RESULTS: Priapism, a prolonged penile erection lasting >4 h, is a rare condition in childhood. There are 3 widely accepted types of priapism: 1) ischaemic priapism, the commonest type seen in children; 2) stuttering priapism, recurrent, self-limiting prolonged erections; and 3) non-ischaemic priapism, rare in children, usually due to trauma. Neonatal priapism has also been described. Ischaemic priapism is a urological emergency causing fibrosis of the corpora cavernosa, subsequent erectile dysfunction and penile disfigurement. The commonest causes of priapism in children are sickle cell disease (65%), leukaemia (10%), trauma (10%), idiopathic (10%), and pharmacologically induced (5%). CONCLUSIONS: Priapism in children must be assessed urgently. Rapid resolution of ischaemic priapism prevents permanent cavernosal structural damage and is associated with improved prognosis for potency later in life. Stuttering priapism requires careful counselling for episodic management. Chronic prophylaxis may be obtained using alpha-adrenergic sympathomimetics, phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors and, in sickle cell disease, hydroxyurea. Non-ischaemic and neonatal priapism may generally be treated less urgently.","['Copyright (c) 2013 Journal of Pediatric Urology Company. Published by Elsevier', 'Ltd.

Some of the most well recognized lesions are chromosomal translocations, and many of these are known to play pivotal roles in pathogenesis. In lymphoid malignancies, some translocations result from erroneous V(D)J-type events. However, other translocation junctions appear randomly positioned and their underlying mechanisms are not understood. RESULTS: We tested the hypothesis that genomic repeats, including both simple tandem and interspersed repeats, are involved in chromosomal translocations arising in hematopoietic malignancies. Using a database of translocation junctions and RepeatMasker annotations of the reference genome assembly, we measured the proximity of translocation sites to their nearest repeat. We examined 1,174 translocation breakpoints from 10 classifications of hematolymphoid neoplasms. We measured significance using Student's t-test, and we determined a false discovery rate using a random permutation statistics technique. CONCLUSIONS: Most translocations showed no propensity to involve genomic repeats. However, translocation junctions at the transcription factor 3 (TCF3)/E2A immunoglobulin enhancer binding factors E12/E47 (E2A) locus clustered within, or in proximity to, transposable element sequences. Nearly half of reported TCF3 translocations involve a MER20 DNA transposon. Based on this observation, we propose this sequence is important for the oncogenesis of TCF3-PBX1 acute lymphoblastic leukemia.",,,,PMC4015642,,,"['R01 CA163705/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 GM103999/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,

The present study was aimed to investigate the expression status of miR-124-1 and its clinical relevance in patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML). DESIGNS AND METHODS: Real-time quantitative PCR was performed to detect the expression level of miR-124-1 in AML patients. The clinical significance of miR-124-1 expression in AML was investigated. RESULTS: miR-124-1 underexpression was identified in 30 (36%) of 83 AML patients. No significant difference could be observed in sex, age and blood parameters between the patients with and without miR-124-1 underexpression. The frequency of miR-124-1 underexpression was higher in the patients with t(15;17) than in others (62% versus 30%, P = 0.040). The status of miR-124-1 expression was not correlated with the mutations of nine genes (FLT3-ITD, NPM1, C-KIT, IDH1/IDH2, DNMT3A, N/K-RAS and C/EBPA). The patients with miR-124-1 underexpression had borderline longer overall survival and relapse-free survival than those without miR-124-1 underexpression (P = 0.052 and 0.045, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that miR-124-1 underexpression is a common event and might have a favorable impact on prognosis in AML.",['(c) 2013.'],['NOTNLM'],"['Acute myeloid leukemia', 'miR-124', 'microRNA']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

While multiple studies show evidence for expression of growth hormone (GH) and GHR mRNA in human cancer tissue, there is a lack of quantification and only a few cancer types have been investigated. The National Cancer Institute's NCI60 panel includes 60 cancer cell lines from nine types of human cancer: breast, CNS, colon, leukemia, melanoma, non-small cell lung, ovarian, prostate and renal. We utilized this panel to quantify expression of GHR, GH, prolactin receptor (PRLR) and prolactin (PRL) mRNA with real-time RT qPCR. Both GHR and PRLR show a broad range of expression within and among most cancer types. Strikingly, GHR expression is nearly 50-fold higher in melanoma than in the panel as a whole. Analysis of human metastatic melanoma biopsies confirmed GHR gene expression in melanoma tissue. In these human biopsies, the level of GHR mRNA is elevated in advanced stage IV tumor samples compared to stage III. Due to the novel finding of high GHR in melanoma, we examined the effect of GH treatment on three NCI60 melanoma lines (MDA-MB-435, UACC-62 and SK-MEL-5). GH increased proliferation in two out of three cell lines tested. Further analysis revealed GH-induced activation of STAT5 and mTOR in a cell line dependent manner. In conclusion, we have identified cell lines and cancer types that are ideal to study the role of GH and PRL in cancer, yet have been largely overlooked. Furthermore, we found that human metastatic melanoma tumors express GHR and cell lines possess active GHRs that can modulate multiple signaling pathways and alter cell proliferation.

We sought to determine the sensitivity and specificity of CSF FCI for the diagnosis of leukemic meningitis in ALL. Between November 2007 and August 2011, 800 CSF samples from 80 patients with ALL were available from diagnostic lumbar punctures (LPs; n = 80), follow-up LPs (n = 687) and at the time of relapse (n = 33). FCI was performed on 267 samples, and only identified aberrant cells in cytologically confirmed cases of leukemic meningitis. A blinded review of all cases with detectable CSF nucleated cells confirmed these findings. We conclude that CSF FCI has a 100% sensitivity and specificity for the detection of lymphoblasts.

A retrospective chart review was then conducted. RESULTS: Of the 14 patients with CTCL and CLL, eight had mycosis fungoides (MF; two with patch stage, two with plaque stage, two with tumor stage, and two with erythrodermic stage), four had Sezary syndrome, one had natural killer cell lymphoma involving the skin, and one had peripheral T-cell lymphoma involving the skin. Eight had concurrent diagnoses, five received a CLL diagnosis first, and one received a CTCL diagnosis first. Ten patients were deceased at the time of data abstraction due to unknown causes (n = 4), lymphoma (n = 2), pneumonia (n = 2), MF (n = 1), or respiratory failure (n = 1). Of the nine patients with concurrent or prior CTCL, seven were deceased, with a median time to death of 10.2 months (range, 6-89 months). Of the five patients with CLL prior to CTCL, three were deceased at 18, 27, and 47 months, respectively, after the CTCL diagnosis. The median survival for the two groups was 12 and 47 months, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with CTCL concurrent with or prior to CLL have a worse overall survival than patients with CLL in whom CTCL later develops.

Combining a protein with other moieties, such as a targeting element, a toxic protein or small molecule, and a fluorophore or polyethylene glycol (PEG) group, can improve the specificity, functionality, potency, and pharmacokinetic profile of a protein. Protein farnesyl transferase (PFTase) is able to site-specifically and quantitatively prenylate proteins containing a C-terminal CaaX-box amino acid sequence with various modified isoprenoids. Here, we describe the design, synthesis, and application of a triorthogonal reagent, 1, that can be used to site-specifically incorporate an alkyne and aldehyde group simultaneously into a protein. To illustrate the capabilities of this approach, a protein was enzymatically modified with compound 1 followed by oxime ligation and click reaction to simultaneously incorporate an azido-tetramethylrhodamine (TAMRA) fluorophore and an aminooxy-PEG moiety. This was performed with both a model protein [green fluorescent protein (GFP)] as well as a therapeutically useful protein [ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF)]. Next, a protein was enzymatically modified with compound 1 followed by coupling to an azido-bis-methotrexate dimerizer and aminooxy-TAMRA. Incubation of that construct with a dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR)-DHFR-anti-CD3 fusion protein resulted in the self-assembly of nanoring structures that were endocytosed into T-leukemia cells and visualized therein.

M3v, characterized by the presence of neoplastic promyelocytes with only sparse fine azurophilic granules, accounts for 10-25% of all APL and has unique biological characteristics. Relapse occurs in approximately 20% of patients with APL. The morphological type of the leukemic cells at relapse is usually identical with the primary disease, and only one case of morphological change at relapse has been reported. Here, we analyzed the clinicopathological features of APL, including 4 relapsed cases emphasizing morphological changes at the time of relapse. The unique finding of the present study is that 2 of 4 relapsed cases changed from M3 to M3v at relapse. The morphological features of these were different in each case (one had blastic features and the other resembled monocytoid leukemic cells). Cytogenetic analyses revealed the continued presence of t(15;17)(q22;q12) at the time of relapse and morphological change. Moreover, the immune phenotype of the leukemic cells changed from CD2(-)/CD34(-) to CD2(+)/CD34(+) at that time. These findings suggest that morphological change at relapse in APL may not be a rare event, and that the leukemic cells can show variable morphological features at the time of relapse, which could result in misdiagnosis as a different type of acute myeloid leukemia. Therefore, a comprehensive approach with emphasis on combined morphological, immunophenotypic, and cytogenetic analyses is important for diagnosis and appropriate treatment of relapsed APL.",,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute promyelocytic leukemia', 'macrogranular variant', 'microgranular variant', 'relapse']",PMC3796242,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recent evaluation of AZD8055, an ATP-competitive mTOR inhibitor, by the Preclinical Pediatric Testing Program showed in vivo antitumor activity against childhood solid tumors, including RMS. Therefore, in the present study, we searched for AZD8055-based combination therapies. Here, we identify a new synergistic lethality of AZD8055 together with ABT-737, a BH3 mimetic that antagonizes Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, and Bcl-w but not Mcl-1. AZD8055 and ABT-737 cooperate to induce apoptosis in alveolar and embryonal RMS cells in a highly synergistic fashion (combination index < 0.2). Synergistic induction of apoptosis by AZD8055 and ABT-737 is confirmed on the molecular level, as AZD8055 and ABT-737 cooperate to trigger loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, activation of caspases, and caspase-dependent apoptosis that is blocked by the pan-caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-fmk. Similar to AZD8055, the PI3K/mTOR inhibitor NVP-BEZ235, the PI3K inhibitor NVP-BKM120 and Akt inhibitor synergize with ABT-737 to trigger apoptosis, whereas no cooperativity is found for the mTOR complex 1 inhibitor RAD001. Interestingly, molecular studies reveal a correlation between the ability of different PI3K/mTOR inhibitors to potentiate ABT-737-induced apoptosis and to suppress Mcl-1 protein levels. Importantly, knockdown of Mcl-1 increases ABT-737-induced apoptosis similar to AZD8055/ABT-737 cotreatment. This indicates that AZD8055-mediated suppression of Mcl-1 protein plays an important role in the synergistic drug interaction. By identifying a novel synergistic interaction of AZD8055 and ABT-737, our findings have important implications for the development of molecular targeted therapies for RMS.",,['NOTNLM'],"['Apoptosis', 'Cancer', 'Cell Death', 'Rhabdomyosarcoma', 'mTOR']",PMC3853277,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study aimed to clarify whether hypoxia affects angiogenic function through exosomes secreted from leukemia cells. We used the human leukemia cell line K562 for exosome-generating cells and human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) for exosome target cells. Exosomes derived from K562 cells cultured under normoxic (20%) or hypoxic (1%) conditions for 24 h were isolated and quantitated by nanoparticle tracking analysis. These exosomes were then cocultured with HUVECs to evaluate angiogenic activity. The exosomes secreted from K562 cells in hypoxic conditions significantly enhanced tube formation by HUVECs compared with exosomes produced in normoxic conditions. Using a TaqMan low-density miRNA array, we found a subset of miRNAs, including miR-210, were significantly increased in exosomes secreted from hypoxic K562 cells. We demonstrated that cancer cells and their exosomes have altered miRNA profiles under hypoxic conditions.

DESIGN: Pooled analysis of efficacy data from four multicenter single-arm compassionate-use clinical trials using protocols from 1993 to 2007. PATIENTS: Of 476 patients with renal toxicity and delayed methotrexate elimination who were treated with intravenous glucarpidase for rescue after high-dose methotrexate, 169 patients had at least one preglucarpidase (baseline) plasma methotrexate concentration greater than 1 mumol/L and one postglucarpidase methotrexate concentration measurement by high-performance liquid chromatography and were included in the efficacy analysis; renal recovery was assessed in 436 patients who had at least one recorded preglucarpidase and postglucarpidase serum creatinine concentration measurement. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Efficacy was defined as rapid and sustained clinically important reduction (RSCIR) in plasma methotrexate concentration, with a concentration of 1 mumol/L or lower at all postglucarpidase determinations. Median age of efficacy-evaluable patients was 20 years (range 5 weeks-84 years). Osteosarcoma (36%), non-Hodgkin lymphoma (27%), and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (20%) were the most frequent underlying diagnoses. Median preglucarpidase serum methotrexate was 11.7 mumol/L. At the first (median 15 minutes) through the last (median 40 hours) postglucarpidase measurement, plasma methotrexate concentrations demonstrated consistent 99% median reduction. RSCIR was achieved by 83 (59%) of 140 patients. A total of 64% of patients with renal impairment greater than or equal to Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events grade 2 recovered to grade 0 or 1 at a median of 12.5 days after glucarpidase administration. CONCLUSION: Glucarpidase caused a clinically important 99% or greater sustained reduction of serum methotrexate levels and provided noninvasive rescue from methotrexate toxicity in renally impaired patients.","['(c) 2013 Pharmacotherapy Publications, Inc.']",['NOTNLM'],"['acute kidney injury', 'carboxypeptidase', 'glucarpidase', 'methotrexate']",PMC3990659,,,['Z99 CA999999/Intramural NIH HHS/United States'],['NIHMS530633'],,,,,,,,

Like drug eruptions, viral exanthema, and toxic erythema of chemotherapy, Demodex folliculitis is a clinical mimicker of acute GVHD and requires nonimmunosuppressive therapy. This case of Demodex folliculitis mimicking acute GVHD highlights the need for skin biopsy in patients who have undergone a stem cell transplant with eruptions on the head and neck. OBSERVATIONS: A 46-year-old white woman with a history of Fms-like tyrosine kinase 3 acute myeloid leukemia presented to the dermatology clinic with a 5-day history of a nonpruritic eruption on her face and neck 28 days after undergoing a double umbilical cord blood hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT). Findings from the skin biopsy demonstrated a deep dermal lymphocytic infiltrate adjacent to follicular units along with an abundance of Demodex mites noted within the hair follicles consistent with Demodex folliculitis. Oral ivermectin, 12 mg, was given, and the eruption cleared within 24 hours. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: To our knowledge, this is only the fifth reported case of Demodex folliculitis following HSCT, but the first ever reported to be successfully treated with oral ivermectin. Demodex folliculitis should be added to the differential diagnosis of skin eruptions that arise after HSCT.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: A total of 133 children aged 5-18 years and 165 parents of children aged 2-18 completed questionnaires of the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory Cancer Module (Pain and Hurt, Nausea, Procedural Anxiety, Treatment Anxiety, Worry, Cognitive Problems, Perceived Physical Appearance, and Communication scales); higher scores indicate a better HRQOL. The Cancer Module scores, weighted by age and treatment status, were compared to those obtained in a previous study of children with other cancers (mostly leukemia). RESULTS: The weighted mean scores for Pain and Hurt (effect size d = 0.26) and Nausea (d = 0.23) from child reports and the scores for Nausea (d = 0.28) from parent reports were higher for children with brain tumors than scores for children with other cancers. The scores for Procedural Anxiety (d = -0.22) and Treatment Anxiety (d = -0.32) from parent reports were lower for parents of children with brain tumors than the scores for parents of children with other cancers. The child-reported Pain and Hurt score of the Cancer Module was higher (d = 0.29) and in less agreement (intraclass correlation coefficient = 0.43) with scores from the Brain Tumor Module, indicating that assessments completed with the Cancer Module misesteem pain and hurt problems in children with brain tumors. CONCLUSIONS: The profiles of cancer-specific HRQOL in children with brain tumors differ from those of children with other cancers; we therefore suggest that these children receive specific psychological support.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We examined three pediatric tumors-medullobastoma, early T-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia, and retinoblastoma-that show multiple genomic structural variations within Wnt signaling pathways. We mathematically modeled this pathway to investigate the effects of cancer-related structural variations on Wnt signaling. Surprisingly, we found that an outcome measure of canonical Wnt signaling was consistently similar in matched cancer cells and normal cells, even in the context of different cancers, different mutations, and different Wnt-related genes.

In this study, we determined crystal structures of extramembrane regions of the TMs from Mason-Pfizer monkey virus (MPMV) and xenotropic murine leukemia virus-related virus (XMRV) at 1.7-A and 2.2-A resolution, respectively. The structures are comprised of a trimer of hairpins that is characteristic of class I viral fusion proteins and now completes a structural library of retroviral fusion proteins. Our results allowed us to identify a series of intra- and interchain electrostatic interactions in the heptad repeat and chain reversal regions. Mutagenesis reveals that charge-neutralizing salt bridge mutations significantly destabilize the postfusion six-helix bundle and abrogate retroviral infection, demonstrating that electrostatic stapling of the fusion subunit is essential for viral entry.

A multiplex PCR (mPCR) method for the detection of these three subgroups was developed and optimized in this study. We first designed a common forward primer, PF, and three downstream primers, AR, BR, and JR, which can amplify 715 bp for subgroup A, 515 bp for subgroup B, and 422 bp for subgroup J simultaneously in one reaction. The mPCR method produced neither cross-reactions with other subgroups of ALVs nor nonspecific reactions with other common avian viruses. The detection limit of the mPCR was as low as 1 x 10(3) viral DNA copies of each of the three subgroups. In animal experiments, the mPCR detected ALVs 2 to 4 days earlier than did virus isolation from whole-blood samples and cloaca swabs. Furthermore, a total of 346 clinical samples (including 127 tissue samples, 86 cloaca swabs, 59 albumen samples, and 74 whole-blood samples) from poultry flocks with suspected ALV infection were examined by mPCR, routine PCR, and virus isolation. The positive sample/total sample ratios for ALV-A, ALV-B, and ALV-J were 48% (166/346) as detected by mPCR and 48% (166/346) as detected by routine PCR. However, the positive sample/total sample ratio detected by virus isolation was 40% (138/346). The results of the mPCR and routine PCR were confirmed by sequencing the specific fragments. These results indicate that the mPCR method is rapid, specific, sensitive, and convenient for use in epidemiological studies of ALV, clinical detection of ALV, and ALV eradication programs.",,,,PMC3911457,,,,,,,,,,,,

Considering different target specificities and the pronounced genetic heterogeneity of Ph+ ALL, which contributes to the aggressiveness of the disease, drug candidates should be evaluated with regard to their effects on the entire Ph+ ALL-specific signaling network. Here, we applied an integrated experimental and computational approach that allowed us to estimate the differential impact of the bcr-abl inhibitors nilotinib, dasatinib, Bosutinib and Bafetinib. First, we determined drug-protein interactions in Ph+ ALL cell lines by chemical proteomics. We then mapped those interactions along with known genetic lesions onto public protein-protein interactions. Computation of global scores through correlation of target affinity, network topology, and distance to disease-relevant nodes assigned the highest impact to dasatinib, which was subsequently confirmed by proliferation assays. In future, combination of patient-specific genomic information with detailed drug target knowledge and network-based computational analysis should allow for an accurate and individualized prediction of therapy.",,,,PMC3795025,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here we report the NMR solution structure of the MLL5 PHD domain showing a variant of the canonical PHD fold that combines conserved H3 binding features from several classes of other PHD domains (including an aromatic cage) along with a novel C-terminal alpha-helix, not previously seen. We further demonstrate that the PHD domain binds with similar affinity to histone H3 tail peptides di- and tri-methylated at lysine 4 (H3K4me2 and H3K4me3), the former being the putative product of the MLL5 catalytic reaction.

RUNX1-ETO is thought to promote leukemia development through the aberrant regulation of RUNX1 (AML1) target genes. Repression of these genes occurs via the recruitment of the corepressors N-COR and SMRT due to their interaction with ETO. Mechanisms of RUNX1-ETO target gene upregulation remain less well understood. Here we show that RUNX1-ETO9a, the leukemogenic alternatively spliced transcript expressed from t(8;21), upregulates target gene Alox5, which is a gene critically required for the promotion of chronic myeloid leukemia development by BCR-ABL. Loss of Alox5 expression reduces activity of RUNX1-ETO9a, MLL-AF9 and PML-RARalpha in vitro. However, Alox5 is not essential for the induction of leukemia by RUNX1-ETO9a in vivo. Finally, we demonstrate that the upregulation of Alox5 by RUNX1-ETO9a occurs via the C(2)H(2) zinc finger transcription factor KLF6, a protein required for early hematopoiesis and yolk sac development. Furthermore, KLF6 is specifically upregulated by RUNX1-ETO in human leukemia cells. This identifies KLF6 as a novel mediator of t(8;21) target gene regulation, providing a new mechanism for RUNX1-ETO transcriptional control.",,,,PMC3794898,,,"['R01CA104509/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', '5T32GM007240/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'F30 HL103106/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 GM007240/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA104509/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,['The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.'],,,,,

In Phase II studies from the USA and Europe, single-agent clofarabine demonstrated activity and acceptable toxicity in elderly patients with previously untreated acute myeloid leukemia. This Phase I, multicenter study assessed the maximum-tolerated dose, safety, pharmacokinetics and efficacy of clofarabine in Japanese adults with acute myeloid leukemia. METHODS: Intravenous clofarabine (20, 30 and 40 mg/m(2)/day) was administered for 5 days to Japanese adult patients with relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukemia or elderly patients with newly diagnosed acute myeloid leukemia. RESULTS: Fourteen patients, median age of 67.5 (59-72) years, were enrolled in this study. Eleven out of 14 patients had relapsed/refractory acute myeloid leukemia. Three patients received clofarabine at 20 mg/m(2), six at 30 mg/m(2) and five at 40 mg/m(2). Frequently reported treatment-related adverse events included thrombocytopenia (100%), anemia (93%), neutropenia (86%), nausea (86%), alanine aminotransferase increase (71%), headache (71%) and febrile neutropenia (57%). Three patients experienced reversible dose-limiting toxicities; two had increased alanine aminotransferase with 30 and 40 mg/m(2) and one had Grade 3 elevation of serum amylase with 40 mg/m(2). The maximum-tolerated dose was 30 mg/m(2)/day. Cmax and exposure area under the curve0-24h increased with increasing dose and were proportional to dose through the tested dose range. Among the 14 assessable patients, four (29%) achieved complete remission and two (14%) complete remission without platelet recovery. The overall remission rate was 43%. CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrate safety and preliminary, promising activity of clofarabine in Japanese patients with acute myeloid leukemia.

We analyzed a phase III randomized intergroup trial comparing six cycles of CHOP-R (cyclophosphamide-Adriamycin-vincristine-prednisone (Oncovin)-rituximab) with six cycles of CHOP followed by iodine-131 tositumomab radioimmunotherapy (RIT) to assess whether any subsets benefited more from one treatment or the other, and to compare three prognostic models. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We conducted univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses of 532 patients enrolled on this trial and compared the prognostic value of the FLIPI (follicular lymphoma international prognostic index), FLIPI2, and LDH + beta2M (lactate dehydrogenase + beta2-microglobulin) models. RESULTS: Outcomes were excellent, but not statistically different between the two study arms [5-year progression-free survival (PFS) of 60% with CHOP-R and 66% with CHOP-RIT (P = 0.11); 5-year overall survival (OS) of 92% with CHOP-R and 86% with CHOP-RIT (P = 0.08); overall response rate of 84% for both arms]. The only factor found to potentially predict the impact of treatment was serum beta2M; among patients with normal beta2M, CHOP-RIT patients had better PFS compared with CHOP-R patients, whereas among patients with high serum beta2M, PFS by arm was similar (interaction P value = 0.02). CONCLUSIONS: All three prognostic models (FLIPI, FLIPI2, and LDH + beta2M) predicted both PFS and OS well, though the LDH + beta2M model is easiest to apply and identified an especially poor risk subset. In an exploratory analysis using the latter model, there was a statistically significant trend suggesting that low-risk patients had superior observed PFS if treated with CHOP-RIT, whereas high-risk patients had a better PFS with CHOP-R.",['(c)2013 AACR.'],,,PMC3872052,,,"['N01 CA004919/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'N01 CA032102/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA35281/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA76447/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'NCIR01 CA076287/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA37981/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA58416/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA027057/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'N01 CA035176/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA35128/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA35261/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA004919/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'N01 CA035431/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA22433/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA073590/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA045560/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA12644/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA035128/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA20319/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'N01 CA013612/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA035192/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA045808/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA013612/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA031946/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA014028/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'N01 CA035119/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA45808/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'N01 CA046441/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA076287/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA14028/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA58882/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA45377/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA035281/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA11083/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA58861/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA35090/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'N01 CA063844/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA46282/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA035261/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA035178/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA16385/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA045450/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA032102/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA046282/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA45450/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA67663/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'N01 CA035178/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'N01 CA038926/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA067575/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA74811/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'N01 CA027057/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA073590/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA046441/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA045377/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA35192/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA058882/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA020319/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA038926/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA074811/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA035431/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA035119/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA011083/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA52654/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA052654/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA76429/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'N01 CA067575/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA067663/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA035176/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA035090/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA31946/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA58723/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA063844/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA058861/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'N01 CA045560/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",['NIHMS532140'],,,,,,,,

However, the ID1 protein has not yet been therapeutically targeted in leukemia. ID1 is normally polyubiquitinated and degraded by the proteasome. Recently, it has been shown that USP1, a ubiquitin-specific protease, deubiquitinates ID1 and rescues it from proteasome degradation. Inhibition of USP1 therefore offers a new avenue to target ID1 in cancer. Here, using a ubiquitin-rhodamine-based high-throughput screening, we identified small-molecule inhibitors of USP1 and investigated their therapeutic potential for leukemia. These inhibitors blocked the deubiquitinating enzyme activity of USP1 in vitro in a dose-dependent manner with an IC50 in the high nanomolar range. USP1 inhibitors promoted the degradation of ID1 and, concurrently, inhibited the growth of leukemic cell lines in a dose-dependent manner. A known USP1 inhibitor, pimozide, also promoted ID1 degradation and inhibited growth of leukemic cells. In addition, the growth of primary acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) patient-derived leukemic cells was inhibited by a USP1 inhibitor. Collectively, these results indicate that the novel small-molecule inhibitors of USP1 promote ID1 degradation and are cytotoxic to leukemic cells. The identification of USP1 inhibitors therefore opens up a new approach for leukemia therapy.",['(c)2013 AACR.'],,,PMC4089878,,,"['1RC4DK090913-01/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'R37 HL052725/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', '5R37HL52725-18/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 HL048546/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 DK043889/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', '2R01 DK43889/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', '2P01HL048546/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'RC4 DK090913/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States']",['NIHMS531872'],,,,,,,,

In this study, we analysed the mechanisms involved in the apoptotic effects induced by GSE on human promyelocytic leukemia HL-60 cells. Thus, GSE treatment succeeded in activating caspase-3 (P < 0.05), the activation being dose-dependent and time-dependent. Activation of caspase-3 induced by GSE was accompanied by mitochondrial membrane depolarization (P < 0.05). Moreover, disruption of mitochondrial integrity caused by GSE treatment subsequently led to activation of caspase-9 (P < 0.05), and also produced a slight increase in ROS levels (P < 0.05). Cytotoxic effects elicited by GSE treatment ultimately resulted in extensive S-phase arrest (P < 0.05) and a substantial increase in the intrinsic rate of apoptosis (P < 0.05).

The Techa River Cohort of individuals residing in riverside villages between 1950 and 1961 when releases from the Mayak plutonium production complex contaminated the river allows quantification of leukaemia risks associated with chronic low-dose-rate internal and external exposures. METHODS: Excess relative risk models described the dose-response relationship between radiation dose on the basis of updated dose estimates and the incidence of haematological malignancies ascertained between 1953 and 2007 among 28 223 cohort members, adjusted for attained age, sex, and other factors. RESULTS: Almost half of the 72 leukaemia cases (excluding chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL)) were estimated to be associated with radiation exposure. These data are consistent with a linear dose response with no evidence of modification. The excess relative risk estimate was 0.22 per 100 mGy. There was no evidence of significant dose effect for CLL or other haematopoietic malignancies. CONCLUSION: These analyses demonstrate that radiation exposures, similar to those received by populations exposed as a consequence of nuclear accidents, are associated with long-term dose-related increases in leukaemia risks. Using updated dose estimates, the leukaemia risk per unit dose is about half of that based on previous dosimetry.",,,,PMC3844904,,,"['HHSN261200900089C/CP/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'ImNIH/Intramural NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,

RESULTS: Despite early setbacks, progresses for monogenic diseases continued unabated. Patients with SCIDs have been cured and the first gene therapy has been approved for lipoprotein lipase deficiency.

Here, we investigated ways to improve ATO activity in CML by modulating cellular VEGF levels. K562 and primary CML cells were transfected with a VEGF antisense sequence. Cell viability and survival were assessed using 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide and trypan blue exclusion assays. Apoptotic cells were detected by flow cytometry following annexin V and propidium iodide staining. The results showed that VEGF depletion effectively promotes enhanced ATO antileukemic activity by repressing bcr-abl protein levels.

CYP2B6 is a polymorphic cytochrome P450 isoform that converts cyclophosphamide to its active form. This study investigated the possible impact of genetic variation in CYP2B6 on response to FC chemotherapy in CLL. Available DNA samples from the LRF CLL4 trial, which compared chlorambucil, fludarabine, and FC, were screened by TaqMan real-time polymerase chain reaction assays for CYP2B6 SNPs c.516G>T and c.785A>G, which define the most common variant allele (*6). Among the 455 samples successfully genotyped, 265 (58.2%), 134 (29.5%), and 29 (6.4%) were classified as *1/*1, *1/*6, and *6/*6, respectively. Patients expressing at least one *6 allele were significantly less likely to achieve a complete response (CR) after FC (odds ratio 0.27; P = .004) but not chlorambucil or fludarabine. Analysis of individual response indicators confirmed that this inferior response resulted from impaired cytoreduction rather than delayed hemopoietic recovery. Multivariate analysis controlling for age, gender, stage, IGHV mutational status, 11q deletion, and TP53 deletion/mutation identified CYP2B6*6 and TP53 mutation/deletion as the only independent determinants of CR attainment after FC.

Eighty one patients received reduced-intensity conditioning (RIC) regimens, whereas 34 received myeloablative conditioning regimens. Although the RIC group was significantly older and included more patients with poor cytogenetic risk, no difference in 4-yr overall survival (OS) was seen between the two groups. In a multivariate analysis, covariates associated with a worse OS were the French-American-British stage of refractory anemia excess blasts in transformation/AML-MLD at peak, poor cytogenetic risk, bone marrow blasts of 20% or higher at HCT and the absence of chronic GVHD (cGVHD). By using semi-landmark analyses, we found that the presence of cGVHD significantly improved OS in high-risk patients or the RIC group. However, there was no difference in OS between those with and without cGVHD among low-risk MDS patients.

However, transcription resumption after individual DNA-lesion repair remains poorly described in mechanistic terms and its players are largely unknown. The general transcription factor II H (TFIIH) is a major actor of both nucleotide excision repair subpathways of which transcription-coupled repair highlights the interplay between DNA repair and transcription. Using an unbiased proteomic approach, we have identified the protein eleven-nineteen lysine-rich leukemia (ELL) as a TFIIH partner. Here we show that ELL is recruited to UV-damaged chromatin in a Cdk7- dependent manner (a component of the cyclin-dependent activating kinase subcomplex of TFIIH). We demonstrate that depletion of ELL strongly hinders RNA polymerase II (RNA Pol II) transcription resumption after lesion removal and DNA gap filling.

A substantial number of T cells, including Treg cells, in tumor tissues and peripheral blood express C-C chemokine receptor 4 (CCR4). Here we show that CCR4 was specifically expressed by a subset of terminally differentiated and most suppressive CD45RA(-)FOXP3(hi)CD4(+) Treg cells [designated effector Treg (eTreg) cells], but not by CD45RA(+)FOXP3(lo)CD4(+) naive Treg cells, in peripheral blood of healthy individuals and cancer patients. In melanoma tissues, CCR4(+) eTreg cells were predominant among tumor-infiltrating FOXP3(+) T cells and much higher in frequency compared with those in peripheral blood. With peripheral blood lymphocytes from healthy individuals and melanoma patients, ex vivo depletion of CCR4(+) T cells and subsequent in vitro stimulation of the depleted cell population with the cancer/testis antigen NY-ESO-1 efficiently induced NY-ESO-1-specific CD4(+) T cells. Nondepletion failed in the induction. The magnitude of the responses was comparable with total removal of FOXP3(+) Treg cells by CD25(+) T-cell depletion. CCR4(+) T-cell depletion also augmented in vitro induction of NY-ESO-1-specific CD8(+) T cells in melanoma patients. Furthermore, in vivo administration of anti-CCR4 mAb markedly reduced the eTreg-cell fraction and augmented NY-ESO-1-specific CD8(+) T-cell responses in an adult T-cell leukemia-lymphoma patient whose leukemic cells expressed NY-ESO-1.

Because anti-CD49d also supports hematopoietic stem cell mobilization, we sought to determine the therapeutic efficacy of a joint CD49d/CD44 blockade. To unravel the underlying mechanism, the CD49d(-) EL4 lymphoma was transfected with CD49d or point-mutated CD49d, prohibiting phosphorylation and FAK binding; additionally, a CD44(-) Jurkat subline was transfected with murine CD44, CD44 with a point mutation in the ezrin binding site, or with cytoplasmic tail-truncated CD44. Parental and transfected EL4 and Jurkat cells were evaluated for adhesion, migration, and apoptosis susceptibility in vitro and in vivo. Ligand-binding and Ab-blocking studies revealed CD44-CD49d cooperation in vitro and in vivo in adhesion, migration, and apoptosis resistance. The cooperation depends on ligand-induced proximity such that both CD44 and CD49d get access to src, FAK, and paxillin and via lck to the MAPK pathway, with the latter also supporting antiapoptotic molecule liberation. Accordingly, synergisms were only seen in leukemia cells expressing wild-type CD44 and CD49d. Anti-CD44 together with anti-CD49d efficiently dislodged EL4-CD49d/Jurkat-CD44 in bone marrow and spleen. Dislodging was accompanied by increased apoptosis susceptibility that strengthened low-dose chemotherapy, the combined treatment most strongly interfering with metastatic settlement and being partly curative. Ab treatment also promoted NK and Ab-dependent cellular cytotoxicity activation, which affected leukemia cells independent of CD44/CD49d tail mutations. Thus, mostly owing to a blockade of joint signaling, anti-CD44 and anti-CD49d hamper leukemic cell settlement and break apoptosis resistance, which strongly supports low-dose chemotherapy.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Despite improvements in outcome over the past decades, the current survival rate still is approximately 60-70%. Cytogenetic, recurrent genetic abnormalities and early response to induction treatment are the main factors predicting clinical outcome. While the majority of children carry recurrent chromosomal translocations, 20% of patients do not show any recognizable cytogenetic alteration and are defined to have cytogenetically normal AML (CN-AML). This subset of patients is characterized by a significant heterogeneity in clinical outcome, which is influenced by factors only recently started to be identified. In this respect, genome-wide analyses have been used with the aim of defining the full array of genetic lesions in CN-AML. Recently, through whole-transcriptome massively parallel sequencing of seven cases of pediatric CN-AML, we identified a novel recurrent CBFA2T3-GLIS2 fusion, predicting poorer outcome. However, since the expression of CBFA2T3-GLIS2 fusion in mice is not sufficient for leukemogenesis, we speculated that further unknown abnormalities could contribute to both cancer transformation and response to treatment. Thus, we analyzed, by whole-transcriptome sequencing, 4 CBFA2T3-GLIS2-positive patients, as well as 4 CN-AML patients. We identified a new fusion transcript in the CBFA2T3-GLIS2-positive patients, involving Desert Hedgehog (DHH), a member of Hedgehog family, and Ras Homologue Enrich in Brain Like 1 (RHEBL1), a gene coding for a small GTPase of the Ras family. Through the screening of a validation cohort of 55 additional pediatric AML patients, we globally detected DHH-RHEBL1 fusion in 8 out of 20 (40%) CBFA2T3-GLIS2-rearranged patients. Gene expression analysis performed on RNA-seq data revealed that DHH-RHEBL1-positive patients exhibited a specific signature. These 8 patients had an 8-year overall survival worse than that of the remaining 12 CBFA2T3-GLIS2-rearranged patients not harboring DHH-RHEBL1 fusion (25% vs 55%, respectively, P=0.1). Taken together, these findings are unprecedented and indicate that the DHH-RHEBL1 fusion transcript is a novel recurrent feature in the changing landscape of CBFA2T3-GLIS2-positive childhood AML. Moreover, it could be instrumental in the identification of a subgroup of CBFA2T3-GLIS2-positive patients with a very poor outcome.",,,,PMC3858557,,,,,,,,,,,,

Unexpectedly, dormant HSCs in the bone marrow do not enter the cell cycle upon Pten loss, they do not lose self-renewal activity, and they are not exhausted. Instead, Pten deficiency causes an up-regulation of the PI3K pathway in myeloid cells, but not in HSCs. Strikingly, myeloid cells secrete high levels of G-CSF upon Pten loss, leading to the mobilization of HSCs from the bone marrow and accumulation in the spleen. After deletion of Pten in mice lacking G-CSF, the splenomegaly, myeloproliferative disease, and splenic HSC accumulation are rescued.

RS lesions are heterogeneous in terms of load and spectrum among patients, and include those involved in CLL progression and chemorefractoriness (TP53 disruption and NOTCH1 activation) as well as some not previously implicated in CLL or RS pathogenesis. In particular, disruption of the CDKN2A/B cell cycle regulator is associated with approximately 30% of RS cases.

The presence of antibodies against feline leukemia virus (FeLV) and of feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) core antigens was detected using the commercial kit Snap Combo FIV-FeLV (Idexx). The group of animals with sporotrichosis contained 93 males with a median age of 22 months, eight (7.1%) of which were positive for FIV and 15 (13.4%) for FeLV. The group of animals without sporotrichosis contained 36 males with a median age 48 months, 10 (13.0%) of which were positive for FIV and eight (10.4%) for FeLV. Of the 112 cats with sporotrichosis and 77 cats without mycosis, 72 (64.3%) and 35 (45.5%), respectively, were IFA reactive. No association was found between age, sex, FIV/FeLV and the presence of antibodies to Bartonella species. The results suggest that the study population can be considered a potential source of zoonotic infection for both diseases.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: In all, 242 patients with APL were randomly assigned (1:1) to oral RIF (60 mg/kg) or ATO (0.16 mg/kg) combined with all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA; 25 mg/m(2)) during induction therapy. After achieving complete remission (CR), all patients received three courses of consolidation chemotherapy and maintenance treatment with sequential ATRA followed by either RIF or ATO for 2 years. The primary end point was the rate of disease-free survival (DFS) at 2 years, which was assessed for noninferiority with a 10% noninferiority margin. RESULTS: The median follow-up time was 39 months. DFS at 2 years was 98.1% (106 of 108) in the RIF group and 95.5% (107 of 112) in the ATO group. The DFS difference was 2.6% (95% CI, -3.0% to 8.0%). The lower limit of the 95% CI of DFS difference was greater than the -10% noninferiority margin, confirming noninferiority (P < .001). No significant differences were noted between the RIF and ATO groups with regard to the CR rate (99.1% v 97.2%; P = .62) or the overall survival at 3 years (99.1% v 96.6%; P = .18). The rates of adverse events were similar in the two groups. CONCLUSION: Oral RIF plus ATRA is not inferior to intravenous ATO plus ATRA as first-line treatment of APL and may be considered as a routine treatment option for appropriate patients.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

With median follow-up of 5.2 years, median OS was 7.1 months in the GO arm and 10 months in the no-GO arm (hazard ratio, 1.20; 95% CI, 0.99 to 1.45; P = .07). Other survival end points were similar in both arms. Grade 3 to 4 hematologic and liver toxicities were greater in the GO arm. Treatment with GO provided no benefit in any prognostic subgroup, with the possible exception of patients age < 70 years with secondary AML, but outcomes were significantly worse in the oldest age subgroup because of a higher risk of early mortality. CONCLUSION: As used in this trial, the sequential combination of GO and standard chemotherapy provides no benefit for older patients with AML and is too toxic for those age >/= 70 years.",,,,,,['ClinicalTrials.gov/NCT00052299'],,,,,,,,,,

Several survivin splice variants have been described however, the prognostic significance of their expression has not been well defined in pediatric acute myeloid leukemia (AML). PROCEDURE: Quantitative expression analyses of BIRC5 mRNA (n = 306) and survivin transcript splice variants (n = 90) were performed on diagnostic bone marrow samples from children with de novo AML treated on the clinical trials CCG-2961 and AAML03P1, then correlated with disease characteristics and clinical outcome. RESULTS: Total BIRC5 expression did not correlate with clinical outcome. Fragment length analysis and sequencing of the entire BIRC5 transcript demonstrated three splice variants. The most prominent product, wild-type survivin, was expressed in all samples tested. Two minor transcripts were present in 90 patients treated on CCG-2961; survivin-2B and a novel variant, survivin-DeltaEx2, characterized by deletion of BIRC5 exon II. A high 2B/DeltaEx2 expression ratio (>/=1) correlated with increased diagnostic WBC count, monocytic phenotype, +8 cytogenetics, lower complete remission (45% [n = 10] vs. 88% [n = 59], P < 0.001) and higher induction failure rates (23% [n = 5] vs. 3% [n = 2], P = 0.009). Consistent with this poor induction response, patients with a 2B/DeltaEx2 ratio >/=1 had inferior 5-year survival rates (OS 36% vs. 60%, P = 0.011; EFS 23% vs. 53% at 5 years, P = 0.001) and appear to have increased relapse risk (P = 0.056). Subset analyses suggest that relative over-expression of 2B, rather than under-expression of DeltaEx2 determines clinical response. CONCLUSIONS: High survivin-2B/DeltaEx2 ratios are associated with refractory disease and inferior survival in childhood AML. Survivin splice variant expression warrants prospective evaluation in clinical trials.","['(c) 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']",['NOTNLM'],"['Survivin', 'acute myeloid leukemia', 'childhood AML', 'molecular genetics', 'refractory disease', 'splice variant']",PMC4285339,,,"['U10-CA98543/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA114563/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA098543/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA180899/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01-CA114563/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA098413/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U24-CA114766/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U24 CA114766/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10-CA98413/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA180886/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",['NIHMS652002'],,,,,,,,

Currently, there are several prognostic factors, such as immunoglobulin heavy chain (IgVH) mutational status, and ZAP-70 protein expression in neoplastic B-cells, that have demonstrated significant discriminative power in the prognostication of CLL. They are, however, largely unavailable in the routine diagnostic laboratory setting. METHODS: In this study, we characterized the IgVH status and ZAP-70 expression by molecular techniques in a cohort of 108 patients with CLL, and correlated these results with three different methods of ZAP-70 expression by flow cytometry. We then assessed the results of these methods in terms of prognostic power as characterized by time to first treatment (TTFT). RESULTS: By comparing three different flow cytometry methods using receiver-operator curve (ROC) analysis, we identified that by utilizing a corrected mean fluorescence intensity (CorrMFI) algorithm for assessing ZAP-70 expression, there was good correlation with both IgVH mutational status, and ZAP-70 expression as assessed by qPCR. We were also able to show that ZAP-70 expression, as assessed by both qPCR and the CorrMFI method, was prognostic of TTFT. CONCLUSIONS: While confirmation in a larger patient cohort, with longer follow-up is required, we believe that the CorrMFI represents the most promising method currently available in a routine diagnostic setting for the assessment of ZAP-70 expression in CLL patients.",['(c) 2013 International Clinical Cytometry Society.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The median CRP level, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and Disease Activity Score in 28 joints at 3 months after anti-TNF treatment in HTLV-I-positive patients were significantly higher than in HTLV-I- negative patients (P = 0.003, P = 0.03, and P = 0.003, respectively). The discontinuation rate due to insufficient response was significantly higher in HTLV-I-positive patients than in HTLV-I-negative patients (P = 0.013). During the 2-year observation period, no patients developed ATL. CONCLUSION: These data suggest that HTLV-I-positive patients with RA had higher inflammation and greater resistance to anti-TNF treatment than HTLV-I-negative patients. Further study is necessary to determine whether HTLV-I infection should be measured when anti-TNF agents are administered to patients with RA, especially in areas were HTLV-I is endemic.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PIP4K2B has been linked to the regulation of gene transcription, to TP53 and AKT activation, and to the regulation of cellular reactive oxygen accumulation. However, its role in human tumor development and on patient survival is not known. Here, we have interrogated the expression of PIP4K2B in a cohort (489) of patients with breast tumor using immunohistochemical staining and by a meta-analysis of gene expression profiles from 2,999 breast tumors, both with associated clinical outcome data. Low PIP4K2B expression was associated with increased tumor size, high Nottingham histological grade, Ki67 expression, and distant metastasis, whereas high PIP4K2B expression strongly associated with ERBB2 expression. Kaplan-Meier curves showed that both high and low PIP4K2B expression correlated with poorer patient survival compared with intermediate expression. In normal (MCF10A) and tumor (MCF7) breast epithelial cell lines, mimicking low PIP4K2B expression, using short hairpin RNA interference-mediated knockdown, led to a decrease in the transcription and expression of the tumor suppressor protein E-cadherin (CDH1). In MCF10A cells, knockdown of PIP4K2B enhanced TGF-beta-induced epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT), a process required during the development of metastasis. Analysis of gene expression datasets confirmed the association between low PIP4K2B and low CDH1expression. Decreased CDH1 expression and enhancement of TGF-beta-induced EMT by reduced PIP4K2B expression might, in part, explain the association between low PIP4K2B expression and poor patient survival.",,,,PMC5321494,,,['A11325/Cancer Research UK/United Kingdom'],['EMS55168'],,,,,,,,

However, the molecular mechanisms of action of HCCR2 in leukemia remain unclear. In this study, we used the RNA interference strategy to investigate the effects of HCCR2 knockdown in the K562 leukemia cell line, and to explore the potential mechanisms involved. Following transfection with small interfering RNA (siRNA) targeting HCCR2 (HCCR2-siRNA), we examined the effects of HCCR2 knockdown on cell morphology, cell proliferation, cell cycle progression and apoptosis in K562 cells. Morphological changes were evaluated by Wright-Giemsa staining. Cell cycle progression and apoptosis were measured by flow cytometry. The expression levels of genes related to the cell cycle and apoptosis were detected by quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) and western blot analysis. HCCR2 expression at the mRNA and protein level was significantly decreased following transfection with plasmids expressing HCCR2-siRNA. Silencing HCCR2 expression significantly suppressed cell proliferation, induced G1 cell cycle arrest and promoted the apoptosis of K562 cells. Additionally, we found that the expression of Bax, p53 and p21 was significantly increased, while Bcl-2 expression was significantly decreased in the HCCR2-siRNA-transfected cells. However, the expression of p27 was not affected. These results suggest that the HCCR2 gene plays an important role in the tumorigenesis of leukemia, thus making it an attractive therapeutic target for acute leukemia.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, the effects of Vitex and its major component, casticin, on leukemia cell lines, HL-60 and U-937, were investigated by focusing on proliferation, induction of apoptosis and differentiation. Identification and quantitation by NMR spectroscopy showed that casticin accounted for approximate 1% weight of Vitex. Dose-dependent cytotoxicity of Vitex and casticin was observed in both cell lines, and HL-60 cells were more sensitive to the cytotoxicity of Vitex/casticin compared to U-937 cells. Furthermore, compared to unstimulated HL-60 cells, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA)- and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D(3) (VD(3))-differentiated HL-60 cells acquired resistance to Vitex/casticin based on the results from cell viability and apoptosis induction analysis. Since the HL-60 cell line is more immature than the U-937 cell line, these results suggested that the levels of cytotoxicity of Vitex/casticin were largely attributed to the degree of differentiation of leukemia cells; that is, cell lines with less differentiated phenotype were more susceptible than the differentiated ones. RT-PCR analysis demonstrated that PMA upregulated the expression of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) in HL-60 cells, and that anti-ICAM-1 monoclonal antibody not only abrogated PMA-induced aggregation and adhesion of the cells but also restored its sensitivity to Vitex. These results suggested that ICAM-1 plays a crucial role in the acquired resistance in PMA-differentiated HL-60 cells by contributing to cell adhesion. These findings provide fundamental insights into the clinical application of Vitex/casticin for hematopoietic malignancy.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Apigenin treatment resulted in cell growth arrest and apoptosis in various types of tumors by modulating several signaling pathways. In the present study, we evaluated interactions between apigenin and ABT-263 in colon cancer cells. We observed a synergistic effect between apigenin and ABT-263 on apoptosis of colon cancer cells. ABT-263 alone induced limited cell death while upregulating expression of Mcl-1, a potential mechanism for the acquired resistance to ABT-263. The presence of apigenin antagonized ABT-263-induced Mcl-1 upregulation and dramatically enhanced ABT-263-induced cell death. Meanwhile, apigenin suppressed AKT and ERK activation. Inactivation of either AKT or ERK by lentivirus-transduced shRNA or treatment with specific small-molecule inhibitors of these pathways enhanced ABT-263-induced cell death, mirroring the effect of apigenin. Moreover, the combination response was associated with upregulation of Bim and activation of Bax. Downregulation of Bax eliminated the synergistic effect of apigenin and ABT-263 on cell death. Xenograft studies in SCID mice showed that the combined treatment with apigenin and ABT-263 inhibited tumor growth by up to 70% without obvious adverse effects, while either agent only inhibited around 30%.

This mouse model, termed APAP autoprotection was used here to identify differentially expressed genes and cellular pathways that could contribute to this development of resistance to hepatotoxicity. Male C57BL/6J mice were pretreated with APAP (400mg/kg) and then challenged 48h later with 600mg APAP/kg. Livers were obtained 4 or 24h later and total hepatic RNA was isolated and hybridized to Affymetrix Mouse Genome MU430_2 GeneChip. Statistically significant genes were determined and gene expression changes were also interrogated using the Causal Reasoning Engine (CRE). Extensive literature review narrowed our focus to methionine adenosyl transferase-1 alpha (MAT1A), nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like 2 (Nrf2), flavin-containing monooxygenase 3 (Fmo3) and galectin-3 (Lgals3). Down-regulation of MAT1A could lead to decreases in S-adenosylmethionine (SAMe), which is known to protect against APAP toxicity. Nrf2 activation is expected to play a role in protective adaptation. Up-regulation of Lgals3, one of the genes supporting the Nrf2 hypothesis, can lead to suppression of apoptosis and reduced mitochondrial dysfunction. Fmo3 induction suggests the involvement of an enzyme not known to metabolize APAP in the development of tolerance to APAP toxicity.

However, since Trp53-null mice develop to term, Trp53 is dispensable for both the maintenance and differentiation of the pluripotent stem cell population in vivo, suggesting the differential functions of Trp53 in ES cells and embryos. To reveal the basis of this discrepancy, here we established a new line of Trp53-null ES cells by sequential gene targeting and evaluated their ability to differentiate in vitro and in vivo. We found that Trp53-null ES cells had defects in differentiation in vitro as reported previously, whereas they were able to contribute to normal development in chimeric embryos.

The aim of this study was to determine whether chemoimmunotherapy prolonged the overall survival in patients with CLL from a single center. PATIENTS AND METHODS: From 1980 to 2010, 273 patients with CLL received: (1) PA (n = 159); and (2) PA plus rituximab (PA+R) (n = 114). All treated patients were included in the analysis, regardless of time at which treatment was administered, duration of therapy, and response. RESULTS: Patients from the PA and PA+R groups were well balanced for demographic, clinical, and biologic features. At 8 years, the survival from diagnosis of the PA+R group was 88% (95% confidence interval [CI], 82-94%) compared with 68% (95% CI, 60-76%) for the PA group (P < .001). When survival of patients treated with PA+R was analyzed according to the time of treatment administration (first- [n = 55] vs. second or more lines [n = 59]), no significant differences were observed (8-year overall survival 89% vs. 87%, respectively; P = .8). CONCLUSION: Chemoimmunotherapy prolonged the survival of patients with CLL and this effect was independent of the phase of the disease at which treatment was given.",['Copyright (c) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

Knockdown of CUEDC2 in K562 cells resulted in decreased cell apoptosis after imatinib treatment; when CUEDC2 was overexpressed in K562/G01 cells, imatinib induced more cell apoptosis.

And c-Myc protein was detected by Western blot under both culturing conditions. After a pre-treatment of c-Myc inhibitor 10058-F4, the apoptosis of AML cell was also evaluated. RESULTS: Apoptosis of AML cells (U937 and KG1a) significantly decreased during co-culturing with MSC (9.88% +/- 1.53% vs 42.83% +/- 2.03%, P = 0.004;20.60% +/- 2.87% vs 42.53% +/- 5.29%, P = 0.030). Drug resistance was implicated. The co-culturing of AML cells with MSC significantly induced an up-regulation of c-Myc. The inhibition of c-Myc with 10058-F4 could induce apoptosis of AML cells. After an addition of 10058-F4 into the co-culture system, the apoptotic rate of KG1a cells significantly increased from 23.87% +/- 1.55% to 57.23% +/- 3.88% (P = 0.009). Similarly the apoptotic rates spiked from 16.07% +/- 2.11% to 53.47% +/- 4.08% in U937 cells (P = 0.004) to overcome the stromal cell-mediated drug resistance. CONCLUSIONS: The co-culturing of AML cells and MSC induces an up-regulation of c-Myc protein so as to cause the emergence of chemoresistance. Therefore targeting c-Myc protein may provide a novel therapeutic strategy of AML.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Several aspects of the integration mechanism, including the length of host DNA sequence duplication flanking the integrated provirus, which can be from 4 to 6 bp, and the nucleotide preferences at the site of integration, are thought to cluster among the different retroviral genera. To date only the spumavirus prototype foamy virus integrase has provided diffractable crystals of integrase-DNA complexes, revealing unprecedented details on the molecular mechanisms of DNA integration. Here, we characterize five previously unstudied integrase proteins, including those derived from the alpharetrovirus lymphoproliferative disease virus (LPDV), betaretroviruses Jaagsiekte sheep retrovirus (JSRV), and mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV), epsilonretrovirus walleye dermal sarcoma virus (WDSV), and gammaretrovirus reticuloendotheliosis virus strain A (Rev-A) to identify potential novel structural biology candidates. Integrase expressed in bacterial cells was analyzed for solubility, stability during purification, and, once purified, 3' processing and DNA strand transfer activities in vitro. We show that while we were unable to extract or purify accountable amounts of WDSV, JRSV, or LPDV integrase, purified MMTV and Rev-A integrase each preferentially support the concerted integration of two viral DNA ends into target DNA. The sequencing of concerted Rev-A integration products indicates high fidelity cleavage of target DNA strands separated by 5 bp during integration, which contrasts with the 4 bp duplication generated by a separate gammaretrovirus, the Moloney murine leukemia virus (MLV). By comparing Rev-A in vitro integration sites to those generated by MLV in cells, we concordantly conclude that the spacing of target DNA cleavage is more evolutionarily flexible than are the target DNA base contacts made by integrase during integration. Given their desirable concerted DNA integration profiles, Rev-A and MMTV integrase proteins have been earmarked for structural biology studies.",,,,PMC3790719,,,"['R01 AI070042/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 AI007245/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,

Determination of this mutational status is laborious and therefore not applied in routine diagnostics. A search for 'surrogate markers' has been conducted over the past few years. One of the most promising surrogate markers is ZAP70, but standardisation of the measurement of ZAP70 has proven to be difficult. Conventionally, ZAP70 expression in CLL cells is related to ZAP70 expression in T cells. We propose a new method in which ZAP70 expression in NK cells is used as reference (new NK-MFI method). We have measured ZAP70 expression in samples of 45 previously untreated CLL patients. ZAP70 in CLL cells related to ZAP70 in NK cells correlated better to cytogenetic risk profile and mutational status than the conventional methods. Negativity of both ZAP70 (new NK-MFI method) and CD38 resulted in a probability of 90% for mutated IGHV genes. In conclusion, ZAP70 expression in CLL cells related to ZAP70 expression in NK cells is a better surrogate marker for mutational status than the conventional T cell related methods.

Unlike general inhibitors of the entire family, selective inhibitors of each member protein can hopefully reduce the adverse side effects in chemotherapy treatments of cancers overexpressing different Bcl-2 family proteins. In this study, we designed four series of benzylpiperazine derivatives as plausible Bcl-2 inhibitors based on the outcomes of a computational algorithm. A total of 81 compounds were synthesized, and their binding affinities to Bcl-2, Bcl-xL , and Mcl-1 measured. Encouragingly, 22 compounds exhibited binding affinities in the micromolar range (Ki <20 muM) to at least one target protein. Moreover, some compounds were observed to be highly selective binders to Mcl-1 with no detectable binding to Bcl-2 or Bcl-xL , among which the most potent one has a Ki value of 0.18 muM for Mcl-1. Binding modes of four selected compounds to Mcl-1 and Bcl-xL were derived through molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulations. It seems that the binding affinity and selectivity of these compounds can be reasonably interpreted with these models. Our study demonstrated the possibility for obtaining selective Mcl-1 inhibitors with relatively simple chemical scaffolds. The active compounds identified by us could be used as lead compounds for developing even more potent selective Mcl-1 inhibitors with potential pharmaceutical applications.","['Copyright (c) 2013 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

We set out to investigate whether Pten is required for hematopoiesis. Analysis of zebrafish mutants lacking functional Pten revealed that HSPCs colonized the caudal hematopoietic tissue normally. There, HSPCs hyperproliferated and engaged in all blood lineages. However, they failed to differentiate into mature blood cells.

Combining a conditional mouse model that closely resembles the slow evolution and the mosaic AE expression pattern of human t(8;21) CBF AML with global transcriptome sequencing, we find that disease progression was characterized by two principal pathogenic mechanisms. Initially, AE expression modified the lineage potential of haematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), resulting in the selective expansion of the myeloid compartment at the expense of normal erythro- and lymphopoiesis. This lineage skewing was followed by a second substantial rewiring of transcriptional networks occurring in the trajectory to manifest leukaemia. We also find that both HSC and lineage-restricted granulocyte macrophage progenitors (GMPs) acquired leukaemic stem cell (LSC) potential being capable of initiating and maintaining the disease. Finally, our data demonstrate that long-term expression of AE induces an indolent myeloproliferative disease (MPD)-like myeloid leukaemia phenotype with complete penetrance and that acute inactivation of AE function is a potential novel therapeutic option.","['(c) 2013 The Authors.

In recent years, the use of retentive filters designed for retaining parvovirus (~20 nm) has become an industry standard in a conscious effort to further improve product safety. Since retentive filters remove viruses primarily by the size exclusion mechanism, it is expected that filters designed for parvovirus removal can effectively clear larger viruses such as retroviruses (~100 nm). In an attempt to reduce the number of viral clearance studies, we have taken a novel approach to demonstrate the feasibility of claiming modular retrovirus clearance for Asahi Planova 20N filters. Porcine parvovirus (PPV) and xenotropic murine leukemia virus (XMuLV) were co-spiked into six different feedstreams and then subjected to laboratory scale Planova 20N filtration. Our results indicate that Planova 20N filters consistently retain retroviruses and no retrovirus has ever been detected in the filtrates even when significant PPV breakthrough is observed. Based on the data from multiple in-house viral validation studies and the results from the co-spiking experiments, we have successfully claimed a modular retrovirus clearance of greater than 6 log10 reduction factors (LRF) to support clinical trial applications in both USA and Europe.",['(c) 2013 American Institute of Chemical Engineers.'],['NOTNLM'],"['modular clearance', 'regulatory compliance', 'viral clearance', 'viral safety']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

We undertook a prospective, open-label, single-arm, multi-institutional phase II study to evaluate the efficacy of a ""5-drug"" oral regimen in children with recurrent or progressive cancer. PROCEDURE: Patients </=21 years old with recurrent or progressive tumors were eligible. Treatment consisted of continuous oral celecoxib, thalidomide, and fenofibrate, with alternating 21-day cycles of low-dose cyclophosphamide and etoposide. Primary endpoint was to assess, within eight disease strata, activity of the 5-drug regimen over 27 weeks. Blood and urine angiogenesis markers were assessed. RESULTS: One hundred one patients were enrolled; 97 began treatment. Median age was 10 years (range: 191 days-21 years); 47 (49%) were female. Disease strata included high-grade glioma (HGG, 21 patients), ependymoma (19), low-grade glioma (LGG, 12), bone tumors (12), medulloblastoma/primitive neuroectodermal tumor (PNET, 8), leukemia (4), neuroblastoma (3), and miscellaneous tumors (18). Treatment was generally well tolerated; most common toxicities were hematologic. Twenty-four (25%) patients completed 27 weeks therapy without progression, including HGG: 1 (5%), ependymoma: 7 (37%), LGG: 7 (58%), medulloblastoma/PNET: 1, neuroblastoma: 1, and miscellaneous tumors: 7 (39%). Best response was complete response (one patient with medulloblastoma), partial response (12), stable disease (36), progressive disease (47), and inevaluable (1). Baseline serum thrombospondin levels were significantly higher in patients successfully completing therapy than in those who progressed (P = 0.009). CONCLUSION: The 5-drug regimen was well tolerated. Clinical activity was demonstrated in some but not all tumor strata.","['(c) 2013 The Authors.

Data about adolescent survivors' overall health and quality of life will help identify survivor subgroups most in need of targeted attention to successfully transition to adulthood. PARTICIPANTS AND METHODS: This ancillary study to the Childhood Cancer Survivor Study focused on children 15-19 years of age who had been diagnosed with cancer before the age of 4 years. A cohort of siblings of pediatric cancer survivors of the same ages served as a comparison sample. Adolescent health was assessed using the Child Health and Illness Profile-Adolescent Edition (CHIP-AE) survey. RESULTS: The teen survey was sent to 444 survivor teens and 189 siblings. Of these, 307(69%) survivors and 97 (51%) siblings completed and returned the survey. The overall health profiles of siblings and survivors were similar. Among survivors, females scored significantly below males on satisfaction, discomfort, and disorders domains. Survivors diagnosed with central nervous system tumors scored less favorably than leukemia survivors in the global domains of satisfaction and disorders. CONCLUSION: In general, adolescent survivors fare favorably compared to healthy siblings. However, identification of the subset of pediatric cancer survivors who are more vulnerable to medical and psychosocial disorders in adolescence provides the opportunity for design and implementation of intervention strategies that may improve quality of life.","['Copyright (c) 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.']",['NOTNLM'],"['adolescence', 'health behavior', 'oncology', 'pediatric cancer', 'survivors']",PMC3988531,,,"['P30 CA021765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U24 CA055727/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 55727/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",['NIHMS553561'],,,,,,,,

Two most commonly used methods for residual disease monitoring are real time quantitative polymerase chain reaction and multiparameter flow cytometry. Results so far are very promising, whereby it is likely that minimal residual disease results will enable to guide future post-remission treatment strategies. However, the leukemic clone may change between diagnosis and relapse due to instability of the tumor cells. This instability may already be evident at diagnosis if different subpopulations of tumor cells coexist. Such tumor heterogeneity, which may be reflected by immunophenotypic, molecular and/or cytogenetic changes, can have important consequences for minimal residual disease detection, since false-negative results can be expected to be the result of losses of aberrancies used as minimal residual disease markers. In this review the role of such changes in minimal residual disease monitoring is explored. Furthermore, possible causes of tumor instability are discussed, whereby the concept of clonal selection and expansion of a chemotherapy resistant subpopulation is highlighted.

Therefore, we studied the feasibility and efficacy of using murine-induced regulatory T cells (iTregs) for the induction of tolerance after bone marrow transplantation. iTregs could be induced in large numbers from conventional donor CD4 and CD8 T cells within 1 wk and were highly suppressive. During graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), CD4 and CD8 iTregs suppressed the proliferation of effector T cells and the production of proinflammatory cytokines. However, unlike nTregs, both iTreg populations lost Foxp3 expression within 3 wk in vivo, reverted to effector T cells, and exacerbated GVHD. The loss of Foxp3 in iTregs followed homeostatic and/or alloantigen-driven proliferation and was unrelated to GVHD. However, the concurrent administration of rapamycin, with or without IL-2/anti-IL-2 Ab complexes, to the transplant recipients significantly improved Foxp3 stability in CD4 iTregs (and, to a lesser extent, CD8 iTregs), such that they remained detectable 12 wk after transfer. Strikingly, CD4, but not CD8, iTregs could then suppress Teff proliferation and proinflammatory cytokine production and prevent GVHD in an equivalent fashion to nTregs. However, at high numbers and when used as GVHD prophylaxis, Tregs potently suppress graft-versus-leukemia effects and so may be most appropriate as a therapeutic modality to treat GVHD. These data demonstrate that CD4 iTregs can be produced rapidly in large, clinically relevant numbers and, when transferred in the presence of systemic rapamycin and IL-2, induce tolerance in transplant recipients.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

About half of RUNX1 translocations remain uncharacterized at the molecular level. We describe here one such event, a t(15;21)(q26.1;q22) translocation identified in an adult patient diagnosed with a t(9;22)(q34;q11.2)-positive acute leukemia. This previously unreported rearrangement yields a fusion of RUNX1 with the antisense strand of the SV2B gene, a new translocation partner of RUNX1, resulting in the expression of out-of-frame mRNA chimeric transcripts and the production of putative truncated RUNX1 isoforms. The t(15;21) translocation also dissociates the P1 promoter of RUNX1 from its open reading frame, reducing RUNX1 expression levels in the patient's leukemic cells. Our data suggest that RUNX1 haploinsufficiency collaborates with the BCR-ABL1 oncogene in this leukemia. The description of this atypical gene fusion is an important addition to the characterization of the pathogenomic mechanisms leading to RUNX1 structural and functional alterations. Furthermore, our data strongly suggests that inadequate dosage of this gene plays an essential role in leukemogenesis.","['Copyright (c) 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In an alternative strategy, we analyzed the impact of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in drug transporter genes on the molecular response to imatinib, using a DNA chip containing 857 SNPs covering 94 drug transporter genes. Two cohorts of CML patients treated with imatinib were evaluated: an exploratory cohort including 105 patients treated at 400 mg/d and a validation cohort including patients sampled from the 400 mg/d and 600 mg/d arms of the prospective SPIRIT trial (n=239). Twelve SNPs discriminating patients according to cumulative incidence of major molecular response (CI-MMR) were identified within the exploratory cohort. Three of them, all located within the ABCG2 gene, were validated in patients included in the 400 mg/d arm of the SPIRIT trial. We identified an ABCG2 haplotype (define as G-G, rs12505410 and rs2725252) as associated with significantly higher CI-MMR in patients treated at 400 mg/d. Interestingly, we found that patients carrying this ABCG2 ""favorable"" haplotype in the 400 mg arm reached similar CI-MMR rates that patients randomized in the imatinib 600 mg/d arm. Our results suggest that response to imatinib may be influenced by constitutive haplotypes in drug transporter genes. Lower response rates associated with ""non- favorable"" ABCG2 haplotypes may be overcome by increasing the imatinib daily dose up to 600 mg/d.",,,,PMC3858547,,['ClinicalTrials.gov/NCT00219739'],,,,,,,,,,

Here, we propose that pronounced invaginations of A/C-type lamins into the nuclear interior represent channels for the transport of regulatory molecules to and from nuclear and nucleolar regions. Using fluorescent protein technology and immunofluorescence, we show that A-type lamin channels interact with several nuclear components, including fibrillarin- and UBF-positive regions of nucleoli, foci of heterochromatin protein 1 beta, polycomb group bodies, and genomic regions associated with DNA repair. Similar associations were observed between A/C-type lamin channels and nuclear pores, lamin-associated protein LAP2alpha, and promyelocytic leukemia nuclear bodies. Interestingly, regions with high levels of A/C-type lamins had low levels of B-type lamins, and vice versa. These characteristics were observed in primary and immortalized mouse embryonic fibroblasts as well as human and mouse embryonic stem cell colonies exhibiting stem cell-specific lamin positivity. Our findings indicate that internal channels formed by nuclear lamins likely contribute to normal cellular processes through association with various nuclear and nucleolar structures.","['(c) 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']",['NOTNLM'],"['CHROMATIN', 'DNA REPAIR', 'ES CELLS', 'HP1 PROTEIN', 'LAMINS', 'NUCLEAR PORES', 'PML BODIES', 'TRANSCRIPTION']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Two secondary analyses were performed to further investigate the impact of ASCT and relapse on QoL. In the primary analysis, we demonstrate an adverse impact of ASCT on QoL which was largest at 4 months and continued throughout the first year after randomization. Further, we demonstrated a sustained adverse impact of relapse on QoL which worsened over time. Despite better disease control by ASCT the side effects thus turned the net effect towards inferior QoL in the first year and comparable QoL in the following 2 years after randomization.

We evaluated a cohort of newly diagnosed t-AML patients treated with cytarabine-based induction therapy from 2001 to 2011. Multivariable linear and proportional hazards models were used to assess the impact of different classes of chemotherapy on the LP and to identify independent prognostic factors for OS. Of 730 treated AML patients, 58 (7.9%) had t-AML. Median LP to t-AML was 5.6 years (range, 0.5-38.4). 64% of patients achieved CR and median OS was 10.7 months. Independent prognostic factors of short LP were age at AD (P < 0.0001) and prior treatment with mitotic inhibitors (P = 0.05). Unfavorable cytogenetics (P = 0.004), antecedent hematologic or autoimmune disease (P = 0.01), age >60 (P = 0.03), and platelet count <30,000 muL (P = 0.04) at the time of t-AML diagnosis were prognostic for inferior OS. A prognostic model using these factors was developed that risk stratified t-AML patients into two groups: favorable and unfavorable. Patients in the favorable group had a median OS of 37.6 months compared with 6.4 months in patients comprising the unfavorable group (P < 0.0001). Multicomponent prognostic models integrating disease or treatment-related covariates can help better understand how t-AML evolves; and can be clinically useful in risk stratifying t-AML patients undergoing induction therapy.","['Copyright (c) 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Single spermatogonia (A(s)), including the spermatogonial stem cells (SSCs), produce successively paired (A(p)), undifferentiated (A(u4) to A(u512)), and differentiated (A(d1) to A(d8)) spermatogonia and preleptotene (PL) spermatocytes through 13 mitoses. Dogfish spermatogonial subpopulations present classical morphological characteristics but cannot be distinguished on the basis of molecular markers. This characterization has been initiated in mammals despite the difficulty to separate each spermatogonial subpopulation. For instance, both glial cell-derived neurotrophic factor family receptor alpha 1 (GFRalpha1) and promyelocytic leukemia zinc finger protein (PLZF) are markers of undifferentiated spermatogonia, whereas receptor tyrosine kinase C-kit is a marker of differentiated spermatogonia. The aim of this study is to characterize spermatogonial markers and to differentiate several spermatogonial subpopulations. Dogfish cDNA sequences have been identified and validated by phylogenetic analyses for gfralpha1, plzf, pou2, as well as for high-mobility group box proteins 2 and 3 (hmgb2 and 3) and for mini-chromosome maintenance protein 6 (mcm6). We have used the anatomical advantage of the polarized dogfish testis to analyze the expression of those markers by RT-PCR and in situ hybridization. gfralpha1, pou2, and plzf have been detected in the testicular germinative zone, suggesting that spermatogonial markers are relatively well conserved among vertebrates but with a less restricted expression for plzf. Moreover, hmgb3 and mcm6 have been identified as new markers of differentiated spermatogonia. Finally, this first molecular characterization of spermatogonial subpopulations in a chondrichthyan model will be useful for further studies on the SSC niche evolution.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Only a few studies of CLL have been conducted in Korea, and no long-term clinical outcome data are available. We assessed the frequency of common chromosomal aberrations in Korean CLL patients using interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and investigated their relationship to clinical outcomes. Between 2000 and 2011, conventional cytogenetic studies were performed in 58 patients, and FISH results were available in 48 patients. We used six DNA probes for the detection of del(13q14), trisomy 12, del(11q22), del(17p13), IGH rearrangement and del(6q23). Chromosomal aberrations were identified in 15 of 58 patients (26%) with conventional cytogenetic studies and in 25 of 48 patients (52%) with interphase FISH, including six patients with complex karyotypes. In contrast with the results of Western studies, trisomy 12 was the most common aberration, followed by IGH rearrangement, del(13q14), del(11q22) and del(17p13). Deletion of 6q23 was not observed, and isolated del(13q14) was less frequent than in Western studies. Compared with the other types of chromosomal aberrations, patients with del(11q22) and del(17p13) were more likely to be Rai stage 3-4 and Binet stage C, resulting in poor responses to chemotherapy and worse outcomes. In contrast, patient with trisomy 12 and isolated del(13q14) showed better responses and superior survival outcomes. The incidence of CLL is lower in Korea than in Western countries, and the frequency of chromosomal aberrations differs, perhaps reflecting differences in the pathogenic mechanism between ethnicities. Large prospective studies are needed to further assess the prognostic value of these results in Korean CLL patients.","['Copyright (c) 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.']",['NOTNLM'],"['Chronic lymphocytic leukemia', 'Korean', 'common chromosomal aberrations', 'cytogenetics', 'interphase FISH']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Thus, we retrospectively collected data from 42 consecutive PCL patients (25 with primary PCL-pPCL and 17 with secondary PCL-sPCL) to explore the role of BBR in this entity. BBR were administered in 29 of 42 patients, while 6 of 25 patients with pPCL underwent autologous transplantation. Objective response (>/=partial response) was significantly higher in patients treated with BBR versus conventional therapies (69% vs. 30.8%, P = 0.04); 27.5% of patients treated with BBR achieved at least very good partial response (vgPR). The highest ORR was observed in pPCL patients treated with BBR (88.9%; >/=vgPR: 33.3%). In BBR-group, grade 3 of 4 hematological, neurological and renal toxicity and neutropenic infections were observed in 41.4%, 7%, 3.4%, and 31%, respectively. With a median follow-up of 51 months, median overall survival (OS) for patients treated with BBR versus conventional therapies was 13 versus 2 months (P < 0.007). Median OS of patients with pPCL and sPCL treated with BBR was 18 and 7 months, respectively (P < 0.001). In the multivariate analysis normal PLTs, treatment with BBR and high quality response were the only powerful predictors for survival. Our study carrying the longest reported median follow-up, demonstrated that treatment of PCL with BBR induces high response rates and prolongs survival over conventional therapies, regardless of additional autologous transplantation rescue or established high risk features, with manageable toxicity.","['Copyright (c) 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Sixty-six patients received first-line imatinib therapy, 26 received interferon followed by imatinib, and 13 received front-line allotransplants. RESULTS: No significant differences were found in overall survival (p=0.57) and blast-free survival (p=0.25) between different first-line therapies. Among 66 imatinib-treated patients, 18 (27.3%) developed imatinib failure, 14 (21.2%) progressed to AP/BP, including eight without preceding suboptimal response. Compared to front-line allotransplant, patients with imatinib failure had a significantly worse overall survival after allotransplants (p=0.015), mainly due to an increase of treatment-related mortality.

The effects of knockdown on cell proliferation and protein expression were examined by colorimetric WST-8 assay and immunoblotting, respectively. RESULTS: In T-ALL cell lines, NOTCH1 knockdown as well as NOTCH2 knockdown suppressed cell proliferation and induced apoptosis. v-Myc avian myelocytomatosis viral oncogene homolog (MYC) protein expression was down-regulated in NOTCH1-knockdown cells but not affected in NOTCH2-knockdown cells. In AML cell lines, cell proliferation was not significantly affected by NOTCH siRNAs. NOTCH2 knockdown increased the level of cleaved NOTCH1 fragment without increasing NOTCH1 expression. NOTCH knockdown reduced the level of mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) protein in the monoblastic leukemia cell line THP-1.

A prospective, multi-center cohort study to determine whether allo-HSCT could decrease relapse rates and improve long-term survival of MLL+ leukemia patients was performed. Fifty-six consecutive patients diagnosed with MLL-rearranged acute leukemia undergoing allo-HSCT from two transplant centers in China were enrolled between October 2007 and October 2012. The trial was registered at www.chictr.org as # ChiCTR-ONC-12002739. The incidences of grades II to IV acute graft versus host disease (aGVHD) and of grades III and IV aGVHD were 28.8% (CI, 16.87-40.8%), and 14.2% (CI, 5.4-23.0%), respectively. The cumulative incidences for chronic GVHD (cGVHD) at 2 years after HSCT were 35.2% (CI, 21.2-49.2%). Up to April 30, 2013, 12 patients had relapsed and 11 died from relapse, and 37 patients were still alive without disease recurrence. The relapse and NRM rates at 3 years were 25.3% (CI, 12.7-37.9%) and 18.0% (CI, 2.6-33.4%), respectively. The probalities of overall survival and leukemia free survival were 61.8% (CI, 46.0-77.6%) and 56.3% (CI, 38.1-74.5%) at 3 years, respectively. Patients transplanted during their hematological first complete remission (CR1) had a lower relapse rate (17.9% vs. 48.1%, P = 0.03) compared with patients transplanted beyond CR1. The median overall survival for the 29 patients not receiving allo-HSCT during the study period was 145 days from diagnosis. This study showed that allo-HSCT could be a valuable treatment choice for MLL+ acute leukemia.","['Copyright (c) 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,['Am J Hematol. 2014 Jun;89(6):669-70. multiple author names corrected'],,,

We report on the molecular status and long term outcome of 121 patients who were treated in Italy between 1986 and 2000 with IFNalpha based therapy and who obtained CCyR. After a median follow up of 16.5 years, 74 (61%) patients were switched to standard imatinib: 48 (65%) lost the CCyR on IFNalpha, and 36 (75%) are alive and in CCyR; 26 (35%) were switched to imatinib when they were still in CCyR on IFNalpha, and all 26 are alive and in CCyR. Forty-seven patients (39%) were never switched to imatinib: 24 (51%) continued and 23 (49%) discontinued IFNalpha, respectively, and 39/47 (83%) are alive and in CCyR. At last follow-up, the BCR-ABL transcripts level was available in 96/101 living patients (95%) The BCR-ABL:ABL ratio was between 0.1 and 0.01% (MR(3.0) ) in 17%, and less than 0.01% (MR(4.0) ) in 81% of patients. No patient was completely molecular negative (MR(4.5) or MR(5.0) ). The OS at 10 and 20 years is 92 and 84%, respectively.

The resultant MLL fusion proteins are known to mediate leukaemia through disruption of the normal epigenetic regulation at the target gene loci. To elucidate the pathogenic role of MLL fusion proteins in HOX dysregulation in leukaemia, we generated a novel haematopoietic lineage-specific Mll-Een knock-in mouse model using a Cre-mediated inversion strategy. The Mll(Een) (/+) invertor mice developed acute myeloid leukaemia, with organomegaly of the spleen, liver and mesenteric lymph nodes caused by infiltration of blast cells. Using Mll-Een-expressing leukaemic cell lines derived from bone marrow of Mll(Een) (/+) mutant mice, we showed that induction of Hox genes in leukaemic cells was associated with hypomethylated promoter regions and an aberrant active chromatin state at the Hox loci. Knock-down of Prmt1 was insufficient to reverse the active chromatin status and the hypomethylated Hox loci, suggesting that Prmt1-mediated histone arginine methylation was only partially involved in the maintenance of Hox expression in leukaemic cells. Furthermore, in vivo analysis of bone marrow cells of Mll(Een) (/+) mice revealed a Hox expression profile similar to that of wild-type haematopoietic stem cells. The leukaemic Hox profile was highly correlated with aberrant hypomethylation of Hox promoters in the mutant mice, which highlights the importance of DNA methylation in leukaemogenic mechanisms induced by MLL fusion proteins. Our results point to the involvement of dynamic epigenetic regulations in the maintenance of the stem cell-like HOX code that initiates leukaemic stem cells in MLL-rearranged leukaemia. This provides insights for the development of alternative strategies for leukaemia treatment.","['Copyright (c) 2013 Pathological Society of Great Britain and Ireland.

Moreover, amsacrine reduced both MMP-2/MMP-9 promoter luciferase activity and MMP-2/MMP-9 mRNA stability in leukemia cells. Studies on amsacrine-treated U937 cells revealed that amsacrine-elicited ROS generation induced JNK and p38 MAPK activation but reduced the phospho-ERK level. Amsacrine-induced ERK inactivation and p38 MAPK/JNK activation were demonstrated to suppress MMP-2/MMP-9 promoter luciferase activity and promote MMP-2/MMP-9 mRNA decay, respectively. p38 MAPK/JNK activation led to up-regulation of protein phosphatase 2A catalytic subunit alpha (PP2Acalpha) in amsacrine-treated U937 cells. Okadaic acid (PP2A inhibitor) treatment increased MMP-2/MMP-9 mRNA stability in amsacrine-treated cells, whereas PP2Acalpha over-expression increased MMP-2/MMP-9 mRNA decay. Amsacrine-induced MMP-2/MMP-9 down-regulation was also related to PP2Acalpha up-regulation on Jurkat, HL-60, K562, KU812, and MEG-01 cells.

Second, we compared the results of the FCCA for prednisolone (PSL) with clinical PSL response in 18 acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) patients to evaluate the reliability of the JC-1 FCCA. Finally, we performed the JC-1 FCCA for bortezomib (Bor) in 25 ALL or 11 acute myeloid leukemia (AML) samples as the example of the clinical application of the FCCA. RESULTS: In ALL cells, the results of the JC-1 FCCA for nine anticancer drugs were well correlated with those of the conventional FCCA using anti-annexin V antibody (P < 0.001). In the clinical samples from 18 children with ALL, the results of the JC-1 FCCA for PSL were significantly correlated with the clinical PSL response (P = 0.005). In ALL samples, the sensitivity for Bor was found to be significantly correlated with the sensitivity for PSL (P = 0.005). In AML samples, the Bor sensitivity was strongly correlated with the cytarabine sensitivity (P = 0.0003).

Although it is clear that MYB can promote proliferation, suppress apoptosis and block differentiation, the identities of the MYB target genes that mediate these effects have only been partially elucidated. Several studies, including our own, have collectively identified substantial numbers of MYB target genes, including candidates for each of these activities; however, functional validation, particularly in the case of differentiation suppression, has lagged well behind. Here we show that GFI1, which encodes an important regulator of hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) function and granulocytic differentiation, is a direct target of MYB in myeloid leukemia cells. Chromatin immunoprecipitation and reporter studies identified a functional MYB-binding site in the promoter region of GFI, whereas ectopic expression and small hairpin RNA-mediated knockdown of MYB resulted in concomitant increases and decreases, respectively, in GFI1 expression. We also demonstrate that GFI1, like MYB, can block the induced monocytic differentiation of a human acute myeloid leukemia cell line, and most importantly, that GFI1 is essential for MYB's ability to block monocytic differentiation. Thus, we have identified a target of MYB that is a likely mediator of its myeloid differentiation-blocking activity, and which may also be involved in MYB's activities in regulating normal HSC function and myeloid differentiation.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Deletion of p53 in the PU.1(ure/ure) mice (PU.1(ure/ure)p53(-/-)) results in more aggressive AML with shortened overall survival. PU.1(ure/ure)p53(-/-) progenitors express significantly lower PU.1 levels. In addition to URE deletion we searched for other mechanisms that in the absence of p53 contribute to decreased PU.1 levels in PU.1(ure/ure)p53(-/-) mice. We found involvement of Myb and miR-155 in downregulation of PU.1 in aggressive murine AML. Upon inhibition of either Myb or miR-155 in vitro the AML progenitors restore PU.1 levels and lose leukemic cell growth similarly to PU.1 rescue. The MYB/miR-155/PU.1 axis is a target of p53 and is activated early after p53 loss as indicated by transient p53 knockdown. Furthermore, deregulation of both MYB and miR-155 coupled with PU.1 downregulation was observed in human AML, suggesting that MYB/miR-155/PU.1 mechanism may be involved in the pathogenesis of AML and its aggressiveness characterized by p53 mutation.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Directly, but not indirectly, regulated promoters were enriched in AML1-binding sites. The majority of promoter regions were specific for the fusion protein and not bound by native AML1 or TEL.

We and others found that Wee1 inhibition sensitizes leukemia cells to cytarabine. Thus, we sought to determine whether chemosensitization by Wee1 inhibition is dependent on p53 dysfunction and whether combining Wee1 inhibition is tolerable and effective in vivo. Synergistic inhibition of proliferation with a Wee1 inhibitor in clinical development, MK1775, and cytarabine was observed in all acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) cell lines tested, regardless of p53 functionality. Mechanistic studies indicate that inhibition of Wee1 abrogates the S-phase checkpoint and augments apoptosis induced by cytarabine. In AML and lung cancer cell lines, genetic disruption of p53 did not alter the cells' enhanced sensitivity to antimetabolites with Wee1 inhibition. Finally, mice with AML were treated with cytarabine and/or MK1775. The combination of MK1775 and cytarabine was well tolerated in mice and enhanced the antileukemia effects of cytarabine, including survival. Thus, inhibition of Wee1 sensitizes hematologic and solid tumor cell lines to antimetabolite chemotherapeutics, whether p53 is functional or not, suggesting that the use of p53 mutation as a predictive biomarker for response to Wee1 inhibition may be restricted to certain cancers and/or chemotherapeutics.

However, the molecular regulation of TET2 expression is poorly understood. We show that TET2 is under extensive microRNA (miRNA) regulation, and such TET2 targeting is an important pathogenic mechanism in hematopoietic malignancies. Using a high-throughput 3' UTR activity screen, we identify >30 miRNAs that inhibit TET2 expression and cellular 5hmC. Forced expression of TET2-targeting miRNAs in vivo disrupts normal hematopoiesis, leading to hematopoietic expansion and/or myeloid differentiation bias, whereas coexpression of TET2 corrects these phenotypes. Importantly, several TET2-targeting miRNAs, including miR-125b, miR-29b, miR-29c, miR-101, and miR-7, are preferentially overexpressed in TET2-wild-type acute myeloid leukemia. Our results demonstrate the extensive roles of miRNAs in functionally regulating TET2 and cellular 5hmC and reveal miRNAs with previously unrecognized oncogenic potential.

A novel strategy to inhibit Mcl-1 activity is the induction of ubiquitin-independent Mcl-1 degradation. Our own and other previous studies have demonstrated caspase-dependent generation of a 28kDa Mcl-1 fragment, Mcl-1(128-350), which inhibits MM cell proliferation and survival. Here, we show that similar to bortezomib, the novel proteasome inhibitors carfilzomib and ixazomib, as well as staurosporine and adaphostin, induce the generation of Mcl-1(128-350) in MM cells. Next, the molecular sequelae downstream of Mcl-1(128-350), which mediate its pro-apoptotic activity, were delineated. Surprisingly, we observed nuclear accumulation of drug-induced or exogenously overexpressed Mcl-1(128-350), followed by elevated mRNA and protein levels of c-Jun, as well as enhanced AP-1 reporter activity. Moreover, drug-induced AP-1 activity was blocked after introducing a point mutation into the highly conserved Mcl-1 caspase-cleavage site Asp127, but not Asp157. Consequently, drug-triggered cell death was significantly decreased in MM cells transfected with Mcl-1 D127A, but not with Mcl-1 D157A. Consistent with these data, treatment with bortezomib triggered c-Jun upregulation followed by apoptosis in Mcl-1(wt/wt), but not Mcl-1(Delta/null) murine embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs). Transfection of a plasmid carrying Mcl-1(wt) into Mcl-1(Delta/null) MEFs restored bortezomib-induced Mcl-1 fragmentation, c-Jun upregulation and AP-1 reporter activity. Finally, our data indicate that drug-induced generation of a pro-apoptotic Mcl-1 fragment followed by c-Jun upregulation may also be a novel therapeutic approach in other tumor entities.",['Copyright (c) 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Thus, increased attention is given to the development of robust high-titer cell hosts for their manufacture. However, the knowledge on the physiological constraints modulating virus production is still scarce and the use of integrated strategies to improve hosts productivity and upstream bioprocess an under-explored territory. In this work, we conducted a functional genomics study, including the transcriptional profiling and central carbon metabolism analysis, following the metabolic changes in the transition 'parental-to-producer' of two human cell lines producing recombinant retrovirus. Results were gathered into three comprehensive metabolic maps, providing a broad and integrated overview of gene expression changes for both cell lines. Eight pathways were identified to be recruited in the virus production state: amino acid catabolism, carbohydrate catabolism and integration of the energy metabolism, nucleotide metabolism, glutathione metabolism, pentose phosphate pathway, polyamines biosynthesis and lipid metabolism. Their ability to modulate viral titers was experimentally challenged, leading to improved specific productivities of recombinant retrovirus up to 6-fold. Within recruited pathways in the virus production state, we sought for metabolic engineering gene targets in the low producing phenotypes. A mining strategy was used alternative to the traditional approach 'high vs. low producer' clonal comparison. Instead, 'high vs. low producer' from different genetic backgrounds (i.e. cell origins) were compared. Several genes were identified as limiting in the low-production phenotype, including two enzymes from cholesterol biosynthesis, two enzymes from glutathione biosynthesis and the regulatory machinery of polyamines biosynthesis. This is thus a frontier work, bridging fundamentals to technological research and contributing to enlarge our understanding of enveloped virus production dynamics in mammalian cell hosts.",['(c) 2013 Published by Elsevier Inc.'],['NOTNLM'],"['Cell engineering', 'Mammalian cell culture', 'Media design', 'Metabolomics', 'Recombinant enveloped virus', 'Transcriptomics']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Novel nanomedicines that have a high ability for flexible, fast drug design and production based on tumor genetic profiles can be created making drug selection for personal patient treatment much more intensive and effective. This review aims to demonstrate the advantage of the young medical science field, nanomedicine, for overcoming cancer drug resistance.

To address this, we evaluated the risk of relapse in 264 AML patients who received T cell-replete, 6/6 HLA matched sibling or 10/10 HLA matched unrelated donor transplantation at a single institution between 2006 and 2011.

At a median follow-up of 299 days, CMV reactivation was associated with significantly lower risk of relapse in patients who received MA conditioning both in univariate (P = .01) and multivariate analyses (hazard ratio, .5246; P = .006); however, CMV reactivation did not significantly affect the risk of relapse in our RIC cohort.

The optimal graft cell concentration, antibody dose, need for complement, and whether alemtuzumab is infused with the graft during transplantation remain unclear. PBPC from 6 normal allogeneic stem cell donors harvested by apheresis were first quantitated and the cellular content defined by flow cytometry. Mononuclear cells were then incubated with incremental concentrations of alemtuzumab (.00001, .0001, .001, and .01 mg/mL) for 30 minutes at 20 degrees C or in cell dose responses with 1, 5, and 10 x 10(6) mononuclear cells/mL added to a fixed dose of .001 mg/mL of alemtuzumab with or without a source of complement. Cells were enumerated and analyzed by flow cytometry before and after exposure to alemtuzumab. To determine the presence of unbound anti-CD52, the supernatant of the cell dose responses were tested using the ELISA assay. Selected CD34+ lineage-negative cells were incubated with antibody at the same working concentrations and conditions and cultured in granulocyte-macrophage colony-forming unit assay. The colony numbers were compared with control cultures devoid of the antibody. Incremental concentrations of alemtuzumab led to a significant (2 log) reduction in CD3, CD4, and CD8 populations, which plateaued at .001 mg/mL. Addition of complement led to a further significant reduction in the CD4 and CD8 cells. The maximum CD4 (3 log) and CD8 (2 log) cell death was obtained at 10 x 10(6) cells/mL. Analysis of supernatants for soluble alemtuzumab by ELISA showed a significant reduction in the free antibody concentration when the cell number was increased from 1 to 10 x 10(6) cells/mL implying utilization/binding of the antibody by target cells. Incremental concentrations of alemtuzumab did not affect the number of granulocyte-macrophage colony-forming units. Alemtuzumab depletes all cells expressing the CD52 antigen and has higher activity on CD3, CD8, and particularly on CD4 cells, which are depleted in excess of 2 logs. From this study, we were able to derive that the optimal cell kill in the graft without detectable free alemtuzumab in the supernatant can be achieved with 1 mg of antibody per 100 mL containing 10 x 10(9) cells and active complement (AB serum).","['Copyright (c) 2013 American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation.', 'Published by Elsevier Inc.

This motivates the design of compounds with joint FAAH/cyclooxygenase (COX) inhibitory activity. Here we present data on the N-(3-methylpyridin-2-yl)amide derivatives of flurbiprofen and naproxen (Flu-AM1 and Nap-AM1, respectively) with respect to their properties towards these two enzymes. Flu-AM1 and Nap-AM1 inhibited FAAH-catalysed hydrolysis of [(3)H]anandamide by rat brain homogenates with IC50 values of 0.44 and 0.74 microM. The corresponding values for flurbiprofen and naproxen were 29 and >100 microM, respectively. The inhibition by Flu-AM1 was reversible, mixed-type, with K(i)slope and K(i)intercept values of 0.21 and 1.4 microM, respectively. Flurbiprofen and Flu-AM1 both inhibited COX in the same manner with the order of potencies COX-2 vs. 2-arachidonoylglycerol>COX-1 vs. arachidonic acid>COX-2 vs. arachidonic acid with flurbiprofen being approximately 2-3 fold more potent than Flu-AM1 in the assays. Nap-AM1 was a less potent inhibitor of COX. Flu-AM1 at low micromolar concentrations inhibited the FAAH-driven uptake of [(3)H]anandamide into RBL2H3 basophilic leukaemia cells in vitro, but did not penetrate the brain in vivo sufficiently to block the binding of [(18)F]DOPP to brain FAAH. It is concluded that Flu-AM1 is a dual-action inhibitor of FAAH and COX that may be useful in exploring the optimal balance of effects on these two enzyme systems in producing peripheral alleviation of pain and inflammation in experimental models.",['(c) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

There were 37 and 22 patients treated with Protocol BCH-03 and CCLG-08, respectively. The clinical characteristics at diagnosis, response to early treatment, the time of relapse, relapse-free survival (RFS) and event-free survival (EFS) in the two groups were analyzed. RESULT: There were no significant differences in gender, age, initial white blood cell count, the central nervous system involvement, immunophenotype, prednisone response, the rate of complete remission, and the time of relapse between the two groups (P > 0.05). The only difference in induction therapy of the two protocols existed in the glucocorticoids used, that is, BCH-03 used 60 mg/m(2) prednisolone and CCLG-08 used 6 mg/m(2) dexamethasone. The doses of vincristine, daunorubicin and L-asparaginase were the same in the two groups. At the end of induction therapy, the MRD negativity rate in BCH-03 group was significantly higher than that in CCLG-08 group (84.2% vs. 47.1%, P = 0.018). The incidences of severe infection of the two groups during induction of remission were similar (P = 0.135). The EFS of BCH-03 group was significantly superior to that of CCLG-08 group (94.5% vs. 71.5%, P = 0.010), and the RFS of BCH-03 group tended to be better than that of CCLG-08 group (94.5% vs. 78.6%, P = 0.059).

The inflammatory cytokine interleukin-6 (IL-6) negatively correlates with hemoglobin concentration in many disease states. The IL-6-hepcidin antimicrobial peptide axis promotes iron-restricted anemia; however the full role of IL-6 in anemia of inflammation is not well-defined. We previously reported that chronic inflammation had a negative impact on maturation of erythroid progenitors in a mouse model. We hypothesized that IL-6 may be responsible for impaired erythropoiesis, independent of iron restriction. To test the hypothesis we utilized the human erythroleukemia TF-1 cell line to model erythroid maturation and exposed them to varying doses of IL-6 over six days. At 10 ng/ml, IL-6 significantly repressed erythropoietin-dependent TF-1 erythroid maturation. While IL-6 did not decrease the expression of genes associated with hemoglobin synthesis, we observed impaired hemoglobin synthesis as demonstrated by decreased benzidine staining. We also observed that IL-6 down regulated expression of the gene SLC4a1 which is expressed late in erythropoiesis. Those findings suggested that IL-6-dependent inhibition of hemoglobin synthesis might occur. We investigated the impact of IL-6 on mitochondria. IL-6 decreased the mitochondrial membrane potential at all treatment doses, and significantly decreased mitochondrial mass at the highest dose. Our studies indicate that IL-6 may impair mitochondrial function in maturing erythroid cells resulting in impaired hemoglobin production and erythroid maturation. Our findings may indicate a novel pathway of action for IL-6 in the anemia of inflammation, and draw attention to the potential for new therapeutic targets that affect late erythroid development.",['(c) 2013.'],['NOTNLM'],"['AICD', 'ALAS2', 'Anemia', 'Band 3', 'CM-H(2)DCFDA', 'Cytokine', 'Epo', 'Erythropoiesis', 'GM-CSF', 'GYPA', 'HBB', 'Hemoglobin', 'IFN', 'IL-6', 'Inflammation', 'Mitochondria', 'SCF', 'SFEM', 'SLC4a1', 'TMRM', 'TNF', 'aminolevulinate synthase 2', 'anemia of inflammation or chronic disease', ""chloromethyl-2',7'-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate, acetyl ester"", 'erythropoietin/Epoetin Alfa', 'glycophorin A', 'granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor', 'hemoglobin beta', 'interferon', 'interleukin-6', 'serum free expansion medium', 'stem cell factor', 'tetramethylrhodamine methyl ester perchlorate', 'tumor necrosis factor']",PMC3947197,,,"['R01 DK082722/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', '5T32 AG000120/AG/NIA NIH HHS/United States', 'P30AR053503/AR/NIAMS NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 AG000120/AG/NIA NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 AR053503/AR/NIAMS NIH HHS/United States']",['NIHMS526032'],,,,,['Blood Cells Mol Dis. 2014 Apr;52(4):236'],,,

The objective of this study was to explore the potential effects of clinically relevant doses of nilotinib against acetaminophen (APAP)-induced hepatotoxicity in mice. To simulate the clinical application in human beings, nilotinib (25 and 50 mg/kg) was administered to mice 2 hr after APAP intoxication (500 mg/kg). The results indicated that nilotinib (25 mg/kg) (i) abolished APAP-induced liver injury and necro-inflammation, (ii) increased hepatic-reduced glutathione (GSH) and its related enzymes synthesis, (iii) suppressed hepatic oxidative/nitrosative stress cascades, (iv) decreased neutrophil accumulation in the liver, and (v) prevented the over-expression of B-cell lymphoma-2 (bcl-2), cyclin-D1 and stem cell factor receptor (c-Kit) proteins in the liver. Although nilotinib (50 mg/kg) acted through the same mechanisms, there was severe depletion in hepatic GSH content by nilotinib itself at that dose level, rather than the potent stimulation observed by using a dose of 25 mg/kg. Consequently, the mortality rate after 18 hr was 100% for nilotinib (50 mg/kg) + APAP (750 mg/kg) versus 60% for APAP (750 mg/kg) and 40% for nilotinib (25 mg/kg) + APAP (750 mg/kg) in the survival analysis experiment. In conclusion, nilotinib can counteract the hepatotoxicity produced by a non-lethal dose of APAP. However, there is a risk of aggravating the mortality for a lethal dose of APAP when nilotinib is co-administered at doses relatively high, or near to the clinical range because of hepatic GSH depletion and c-kit inhibition.","['(c) 2013 Nordic Association for the Publication of BCPT (former Nordic', 'Pharmacological Society).']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This rare condition commonly consists of a proliferation of more or less immature cells with a myeloid immunophenotype, very exceptional cases showing a megakaryoblastic or erythroid differentiation. The most common localization of MS is the skin, lymph node, soft tissues and bones, but CNS involvement is exceedingly rare, with no cases reported in the sellar region.

The histological examination documented a proliferation of large, blastic cells, frequently multinucleated; a diagnosis of MS with megakaryoblastic differentiation, arising in a background of chronic idiopathic myelofibrosis, was suggested by immunohistochemistry, owing to CD42b, CD45, CD61 and LAT (linker for activation of T cells) positivity.

We analysed SLC22A1 mRNA levels and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) located in exon 7 in 153 diagnostic whole blood samples from two patient cohorts. The level of SLC22A1 expression did not significantly correlate with imatinib failure or achievement of molecular remission. The SNP 408V>M (g.1222G>A) was present in 65% of patients and was associated in all cases with an eight base-pair insertion (8(+) allele) at the 3' end of exon 7. The latter generates an alternative splice site, leading to a premature stop codon. M420del was found in 33% of patients and never in cis with 8(+) (the 3(-) allele). Significantly longer times to 1% and 0.1% molecular responses (by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction) were seen in patients with 8(+) 8(+) or 8(+) N compared to those with the remaining four genotypes (N = no insertion or deletion). Patients lacking 8(+) and 3(-) (NN, 18%) showed the best outcomes overall.

The presenting features of paediatric APL may include severe bleeding and thrombotic complications, which contribute to the high early death rate. The incidence of leucocytosis and the microgranular subtype is greater in paediatric than adult APL, and children experience greater ATRA-related toxicity. It is crucial to begin ATRA therapy and intensive platelet and fibrinogen replacement on first suspicion of APL.

The TP53 homolog TAp63 promotes apoptosis and chemosensitivity in solid tumours and its deregulation may contribute to CLL cell survival. We found that TAp63alpha was the most prevalent TP63 isoform in CLL. Compared to healthy B cells, TAp63 mRNA was repressed in 55.7% of CLL samples. TP63 promoter methylation was high in CLL and inversely correlated with TP63 protein expression in B-cell lymphoma cell lines. siRNA-mediated knockdown of TP63 resulted in partial protection from spontaneous apoptosis accompanied by reductions in PMAIP1 (NOXA), BBC3 (PUMA), and BAX mRNA in CLL cells and increased proliferation of Raji lymphoma cells. TAp63 mRNA levels were higher in CLL with unmutated IGHV. B-cell receptor (BCR) engagement led to repression of TP63 mRNA expression in malignant B cells, while pharmacological inhibition of BCR signalling prevented TP63 downregulation. MIR21, known to target TAp63, correlated inversely with TAp63 expression in CLL, and BCR-mediated downregulation of TP63 was accompanied by MIR21 upregulation in most CLL samples. Our data illustrate the pro-apoptotic function of TP63, provide insights into the mechanisms of BCR-targeting agents, and establish a rationale for designing novel approaches to induce TP63 in CLL and B-cell lymphoma.",['(c) 2013 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.'],['NOTNLM'],"['B-cell receptor', 'TP63', 'chronic lymphocytic leukaemia', 'methylation']",PMC3939033,,,"['P30 CA023108/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', '3P30CA023108-31S4/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",['NIHMS527386'],,,,,,,,

EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: Cytotoxicity in human NSCLC cell lines was assessed by sulforhodamine B and 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assays. Cell cycle phase distributions were estimated with FACScan flow cytometry. Protein expression was detected by Western blotting analysis. Efflux of rhodamine 123 or calcein-acetoxymethylester was used to study the P-gp profile. The A549 xenograft model in mice was used to assess in vivo anti-tumour activity. KEY RESULTS: MPT0B014 showed potent anti-proliferative activity against A549, H1299 and H226 cells. It induced G2/M arrest with down-regulation of Cdc (Tyr15) and Cdc25C, and up-regulation of cyclin B1, phospho-Cdc2 (Thr161) and Aurora A/B. P-gp-overexpressing National Cancer Institute/Adriamycin-Resistant cells were also sensitive to B014. B014-induced loss of Mcl-1 was accompanied by activation of caspases-3, -7, -8 and -9, and initiation of apoptosis. B014 in combination with erlotinib caused significant tumour inhibition in vitro and in vivo. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: MPT0B014 exerted cytotoxicity against human NSCLC cell lines with little susceptibility to P-gp. Combined with the EGF receptor inhibitor, erlotinib, MPT0B014 exerted significant growth inhibition of A549 cells both in vitro and in vivo. B014 could be useful as an anti-cancer agent.",['(c) 2013 The British Pharmacological Society.'],['NOTNLM'],"['MPT0B014', 'Mcl-1', 'NSCLC', 'P-gp', 'apoptosis', 'mitosis arrest']",PMC3874701,,,,,,,,,,,,

Single nucleotide polymorphism arrays (SNP-A) have been proposed as a tool for surveillance of clonal evolution in BMFS. To better understand the natural history of BMFS and to assess the clinical utility of SNP-A in these disorders, we analysed 124 SNP-A from a comprehensively characterized cohort of 91 patients at our BMFS centre. SNP-A were correlated with medical histories, haematopathology, cytogenetic and molecular data. To assess clonal evolution, longitudinal analysis of SNP-A was performed in 25 patients. We found that acquired copy number-neutral loss of heterozygosity (CN-LOH) was significantly more frequent in acquired aplastic anaemia (aAA) than in other BMFS (odds ratio 12.2, P < 0.01). Homozygosity by descent was most common in congenital BMFS, frequently unmasking autosomal recessive mutations. Copy number variants (CNVs) were frequently polymorphic, and we identified CNVs enriched in neutropenia and aAA. Our results suggest that acquired CN-LOH is a general phenomenon in aAA that is probably mechanistically and prognostically distinct from typical CN-LOH of myeloid malignancies. Our analysis of clinical utility of SNP-A shows the highest yield of detecting new clonal haematopoiesis at diagnosis and at relapse.",['(c) 2013 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.'],['NOTNLM'],"['aplastic anaemia', 'bone marrow failure', 'chromosomal rearrangements', 'clonal evolution', 'cytogenetic diagnosis']",PMC3986350,,['GENBANK/GSE48484'],"['T32 GM008638/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 HL007439/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32-GM008638/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', '5-T32-HL-07439-34/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA105312/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA016520/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'K12 HL087064/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",['NIHMS529638'],,,,,,,,

It has been observed that HIV-1/HTLV-2 co-infections are associated with slower rates of CD4(+) T cell decline and delayed progression to AIDS. This immunological benefit has been linked to the ability of Tax2, the transcriptional activating protein of HTLV-2, to induce the expression of macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)-1alpha/CCL3, MIP-1beta/CCL4 and regulated upon activation normal T cell expressed and secreted (RANTES)/CCL5 and to down-regulate the expression of the CCR5 co-receptor in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). This study aimed to assess the role of Tax2-mediated activation of the nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappaB) signalling pathway on the production of the anti-viral CC-chemokines MIP-1alpha, MIP-1beta and RANTES. Recombinant Tax1 and Tax2 proteins, or proteins expressed via adenoviral vectors used to infect cells, were tested for their ability to activate the NF-kappaB pathway in cultured PBMCs in the presence or absence of NF-kappaB pathway inhibitors. Results showed a significant release of MIP-1alpha, MIP-1beta and RANTES by PBMCs after the activation of p65/RelA and p50. The secretion of these CC-chemokines was significantly reduced (P < 0.05) by canonical NF-kappaB signalling inhibitors.

Circulating blasts are cleared from the peripheral blood, while bone marrow blasts are either unaffected or are cleared from the marrow at a much slower rate. We used an in vitro model of FLT3-ITD AML blasts co-cultured with normal human bone marrow stromal cells to investigate the basis for this dichotomous response pattern to FLT3 inhibitors. We have found that in blasts on stroma, potent FLT3 inhibition predominantly results in cell cycle arrest rather than apoptosis. The anti-apoptotic effect is mediated through a combination of direct cell-cell contact and soluble factors. The addition of exogenous FLT3 ligand (FL) augments the protection, primarily by shifting the 50% inhibitory concentration for FLT3 inhibition upwards. Cytokine-activated extracellular regulated kinase (ERK), rather than STAT5, appears to be the most important downstream signalling protein mediating the protective effect, and inhibition of MEK significantly abrogates stromal-mediated resistance. These findings explain the phenomenon of peripheral blood versus bone marrow blast responses and suggest that the combination of potent FLT3 inhibition and MEK inhibition is a promising strategy for the treatment of FLT3-ITD AML.",['(c) 2013 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.'],['NOTNLM'],"['FLT3-ITD', 'acute myeloid leukaemia', 'bone marrow stroma', 'extracellular regulated kinase', 'quizartinib']",PMC4076672,,,"['P50 CA100632/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA128864/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P50 CA100632-06/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",['NIHMS529637'],,,,,,,,

Although various signaling pathways have been characterized to be involved in the FcepsilonRI-mediated responses, little is known about the precious mechanism for the expression of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) in mast cells. Here, we report that rapamycin, a specific inhibitor of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), reduces the expression of TNF-alpha in rat basophilic leukemia (RBL-2H3) cells. IgE or specific antigen stimulation of RBL-2H3 cells increases the expression of TNF-alpha and activates various signaling molecules including S6K1, Akt and p38 MAPK. Rapamycin specifically inhibits antigen-induced TNF-alpha mRNA level, while other kinase inhibitors have no effect on TNF-alpha mRNA level. These data indicate that mTOR signaling pathway is the main regulation mechanism for antigen-induced TNF-alpha expression. TNF-alpha mRNA stability analysis using reporter construct containing TNF-alpha adenylate/uridylate-rich elements (AREs) shows that rapamycin destabilizes TNF-alpha mRNA via regulating the AU-rich element of TNF-alpha mRNA. The antigen-induced activation of S6K1 is inhibited by specific kinase inhibitors including mTOR, PI3K, PKC and Ca(2+)chelator inhibitor, while TNF-alpha mRNA level is reduced only by rapamycin treatment. These data suggest that the effects of rapamycin on the expression of TNF-alpha mRNA are not mediated by S6K1 but regulated by mTOR. Taken together, our results reveal that mTOR signaling pathway is a novel regulation mechanism for antigen-induced TNF-alpha expression in RBL-2H3 cells.",,['NOTNLM'],"['Mast cells', 'Rapamycin', 'S6K1', 'Stability', 'mRNA', 'mTOR']",PMC3792200,,,,,,,,,,,,

In vivo, TEL-Syk expression in pre-B cells blocks B cell differentiation, leading to lymphoid leukemia. Here, we demonstrate that TEL-Syk introduced into fetal liver hematopoietic cells, which are then adoptively transferred into lethally irradiated recipients, leads to an aggressive myelodysplasia with myelofibrosis that is lethal in mice by 60-75 days. Expression of TEL-Syk induces a short-lived myeloexpansion that is rapidly followed by bone marrow failure and extreme splenic/hepatic fibrosis accompanied by extensive apoptosis. The disease is dependent on Syk kinase activity. Analysis of serum from TEL-Syk mice reveals an inflammatory cytokine signature reminiscent of that found in the sera from patients and mouse models of myeloproliferative neoplasms. TEL-Syk expressing cells showed constitutive STAT5 phosphorylation, which was resistant to JAK inhibition, consistent with deregulated cytokine signaling.

It has been associated with tumor activation, immune suppression and aging, owing to the secretion of proinflammatory mediators. The bacterial genotoxin colibactin, encoded by the pks genomic island is frequently harboured by Escherichia coli strains of the B2 phylogenetic group. Mammalian cells exposed to live pks+ bacteria exhibit DNA-double strand breaks (DSB) and undergo cell-cycle arrest and death. Here we show that cells that survive the acute bacterial infection with pks+ E. coli display hallmarks of cellular senescence: chronic DSB, prolonged cell-cycle arrest, enhanced senescence-associated beta-galactosidase (SA-beta-Gal) activity, expansion of promyelocytic leukemia nuclear foci and senescence-associated heterochromatin foci. This was accompanied by reactive oxygen species production and pro-inflammatory cytokines, chemokines and proteases secretion. These mediators were able to trigger DSB and enhanced SA-beta-Gal activity in bystander recipient cells treated with conditioned medium from senescent cells. Furthermore, these senescent cells promoted the growth of human tumor cells.

In this study, we evaluated pim-1 expression in tumors, tumor stroma and tumor-adjacent mucosa together as an independent prognostic factor for colon cancer patients. The study included 343 colon cancer patients. Immunohistochemical staining was used to detect pim-1. Multivariate cox regression for disease-free survival (DFS) were used to identify independent prognostic factors. Analytic hierarchy process (AHP) was used to calculate the weight of pim-1 in tumors, tumor stroma and tumor-adjacent mucosa in order to obtain a Pim-1 total score (PTS) for recurrence and survival. Kaplan-Meier DFS curves and OS curves for patients with different pim-1 expression levels were compared using the log-rank test. In this study, four independent prognostic factors were identified for colon cancer patients: pim-1 expression in tumors, tumor stroma, tumor-adjacent mucosa, as well as tumor stage. It has been established that clinical stage is an important prognostic factor for colon cancer patients. However, PTS can identify the patients who are likely to recur not only in the whole radical excision group but also within each stage of this group. Based on the results of this study we can conclude that the PTS combined with clinical staging system may be a better predictor of colon cancer patients' prognosis than using the clinical stage system alone.

In search of a sensitizing strategy to overcome this relative ATRA resistance, we investigated the potency of the HDAC class-I selective inhibitor entinostat in AML cell lines Kasumi-1 and HL-60 and primary AML blasts. Entinostat alone induced robust differentiation of both cell lines, which was enhanced by the combination with ATRA. This ""priming"" effect on ATRA-induced differentiation was at least equivalent to that achieved with the DNA hypomethylating agent decitabine, and could overall be recapitulated in primary AML blasts treated ex vivo. Moreover, entinostat treatment established the activating chromatin marks acH3, acH3K9, acH4 and H3K4me3 at the promoter of the RARbeta2 gene, an essential mediator of retinoic acid (RA) signaling in different solid tumor models. Similarly, RARbeta2 promoter hypermethylation (which in primary blasts from 90 AML/MDS patients was surprisingly infrequent) could be partially reversed by decitabine in the two cell lines. Re-induction of the epigenetically silenced RARbeta2 gene was achieved only when entinostat or decitabine were given prior to ATRA treatment. Thus in this model, reactivation of RARbeta2 was not necessarily required for the differentiation effect, and pharmacological RARbeta2 promoter demethylation may be a bystander phenomenon rather than an essential prerequisite for the cellular effects of decitabine when combined with ATRA. In conclusion, as a ""priming"" agent for non-M3 AML blasts to the differentiation-inducing effects of ATRA, entinostat is at least as active as decitabine, and both act in part independently from RARbeta2. Further investigation of this treatment combination in non-M3 AML patients is therefore warranted, independently of RARbeta2 gene silencing by DNA methylation.",,,,PMC3792939,,,,,,,,,,,,

Two-pore domain (K2P) potassium channels are background channels which enable the leak of potassium ions from cells. As these channels are open at rest they have a profound effect on cellular membrane potential and subsequently the electrical activity and behaviour of cells in which they are expressed. The K2P family of channels has 15 mammalian members and already 4 members of this family (K2P2.1, K2P3.1, K2P9.1, K2P5.1) have been implicated in cancer. Here we examine the expression of all 15 members of the K2P family of channels in a range of cancer types. This was achieved using the online cancer microarray database, Oncomine (www.oncomine.org). Each gene was examined across 20 cancer types, comparing mRNA expression in cancer to normal tissue. This analysis revealed all but 3 K2P family members (K2P4.1, K2P16.1, K2P18.1) show altered expression in cancer. Overexpression of K2P channels was observed in a range of cancers including breast, leukaemia and lung while more cancers (brain, colorectal, gastrointestinal, kidney, lung, melanoma, oesophageal) showed underexpression of one or more channels. K2P1.1, K2P3.1, K2P12.1, were overexpressed in a range of cancers. While K2P1.1, K2P3.1, K2P5.1, K2P6.1, K2P7.1 and K2P10.1 showed significant underexpression across the cancer types examined. This analysis supports the view that specific K2P channels may play a role in cancer biology. Their altered expression together with their ability to impact the function of other ion channels and their sensitivity to environmental stimuli (pO2, pH, glucose, stretch) makes understanding the role these channels play in cancer of key importance.",,,,PMC3792113,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we show that the transcription factor Promyelocytic Leukemia Zinc Finger (PLZF) plays a critical role shaping patterns of neuronal differentiation by gating the expression of Fibroblast Growth Factor (FGF) Receptor 3 and responsiveness of progenitors to FGFs. PLZF elevation increases FGFR3 expression and STAT3 pathway activity, suppresses neurogenesis, and biases progenitors towards glial cell production.

In an effort to improve outcomes, we performed a phase I/II study of a novel clofarabine based combination regimen called TVTC. Herein, we report the response rates of patients in the phase II portion of the study. PROCEDURE: Seventeen patients with R/R ALL, AML, or biphenotypic leukemia were enrolled. Sixteen patients were evaluable for response. Patients were treated at the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) from the phase I portion of the study (clofarabine 40 mg/m(2) /day IV x 5 days, topotecan 1 mg/m(2) /day IV continuous infusion x 5 days, vinorelbine 20 mg/m(2) /week IV x 3 weeks, thiotepa 15 mg/m(2)/day IV x 1 day). The primary endpoint was overall response rate (ORR), defined as CR or CR without platelet recovery (CRp). RESULTS: The ORR was 69% (10 CR, 1 CRp). Among the 11 responders, 9 (82%) proceeded to hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. The most common grade 3+ non-hematologic toxicities were febrile neutropenia (82%) and transient transaminase elevation (47%). CONCLUSIONS: TVTC demonstrates significant activity in patients with R/R acute leukemia. The activity in R/R AML patients was very encouraging, with 8 of 12 (67%) patients achieving a CR/CRp. Patients with high risk de novo AML may benefit from incorporation of TVTC therapy into frontline treatment regimens. This regimen warrants further exploration in a larger cohort of patients with R/R leukemia.","['(c) 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']",['NOTNLM'],"['clofarabine', 'leukemia', 'pediatric', 'refractory', 'relapsed']",,,,,,,,,,,,,
